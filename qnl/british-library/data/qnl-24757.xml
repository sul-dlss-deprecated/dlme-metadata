Lynch’s navigation rights on the rivers of Mesopotamia, I had the honour to report that the Sublime Porte had addressed to me a “ notice informing me that the Imperial Government had decided to allow the second barge until the 3,800 tons of cargo accumulated at Bussorah had been forwarded, and that the necessary instructions had been sent to the competent authorities. I had, however, taken exception to this “ notice,” which went on to say in the second paragraph that, inasmuch as this permis sion was accorded in exceptional circumstances, it could not constitute a precedent, the words “ et que les susdits bateaux ne pourront j)oint se servir d alleges apres le transport des marchandises precitees ” seeming to apply a denial of Lynch s right to tow even one barge. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, when their attention was called to this, replied that the privilege granted in 1899 was only provisional, and pointed out that His Majesty’s Embassy had never answered the Sublime Fortes note verbale No. 16 of the 10th March, 1902, which complained of the continued use of the barges. It must, in fact, be admitted that some doubt exists as to the real scope of the permission granted by the Sublime Porte in 1899, but in view of the language used m Sir N. O’Conor’s notes of the 1st September and the 25th October of that year, and of the fact that the use of the one barge has continued ever since apparently, His Majesty s Embassy feel justified in maintaining that the right to tow one barge must be considered as a permanently acquired right. r Io the point of the Sublime Porte that no answer was ever made to their note verbale of the 10th March, 1902, it was replied that no attempt was made to enforce the contention put forward in that note verbale, and that under the conditions prevailing under the old regime that fact sufficiently explained and justified the embassy’s failure to answer the note. It was further pointed out that the Sublime Porte had equally failed to reply to Sir N. O’Conor s notes of the year 1899. . . After a considerable amount of further discussion on the subject, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs has at last been induced to agree to suppress the phrase in the “ notice ” to which His Majesty’s Embassy had taken exception. The amended version, copy of which I have the honour to transmit herewith, differs fiom the original one only in its omissions at the end of paragraph 2 of the words alieady quoted. Minister would not go so far as to admit categorically the right of Messrs. Lynch to tow the single barge, and the result of the substitution of this for the original notice is therefore to leave the status quo untouched as regards the single baige, but to allow the use of a second barge to work off the accumulation of cargo. Majeste britannique en date du 25 juillet dernier, le Gouvernement Imperial a decide d’autoriser, cette fois encore, les bateaux de la compagnie Lynch a prendre a leur remorque deux alleges, afin d’assurer le transport de 3,800 tonnes de marchandises accumulees a Bassora. II est bien entendu que cette autorisation, n’ayant ete accordee qu a titre excep- tionnel, ne pourra constituer un precedent pour I’avenir.

ROBERTS, Acting Secretary. Enclosure in No. 1. Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co. to Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Reserve Steamer. SEVIAN BEY called yesterday and informed me that he had mentioned the conversation, reported in my confidential note “ B ” with letter of the 25th instant, to his Excellency the vali, and that he coidd not make any progress in regard to the proposed arrangement to run the reserve steamer on terms similar to those proposed in your telegram of the 14th instant. His Excellency declines to permit us to run the steamer, but suggested that we should agree to loan the Idara Nahrieh the reserve steamer to bring up their accumulation and they should lend us a steamer to bring up our accumulated cargo on mutual terms. This proposal is put forward by the vali in order to support the principle that we should not be allowed under any circumstances to extend our privileges on the river, while endeavouring to show the mercantile community that he is trying to facilitate the transport of their goods from Bussorah. Neither Sevian Bey nor I consider this proposal a serious one ; moreover, we do not think any workable arrangement can be made, as we should not get the loan of a suitable steamer, nor should we be disposed to trust their officers and crew with the carriage of cargo belonging to our shippers. Under these circumstances I have agreed with Sevian Bey to let the matter rest for the present, or until the vali is more reasonable in his views of the whole question. Mr. Whittall’s letter of the 23rd August addressed to the company, a copy of which I have just received with your note “ A.,” letter of the 1st instant, confirms my opinion that Djmel Bey is not straightforward in dealing with the matter. He emphatically stated to me that he recognised the necessit} 7 of improving the facilities of transport on the rivers, and I know from excellent authority that a petition signed by all the most influential merchants in Bagdad has been presented to him, pointing out the disabilities under which business is now carried on. The accumulation of cargo at Bussorah fell to 2,700 tons with us and 1,700 tons with the Idara administration on the 11th instant, and has now risen to 3,200 tons with us and 3,500 tons with them. Obviously a total of 6,700 tons of accumulated cargo at Bussorah, while the steamers can only carry light loads, and are much delayed en route with navigation difficulties and twenty-four hours’ quarantine at Bagdad, proves the urgent necessity of employing all the steamers available to bring it forward. In the course of conversation I reminded Sevian Bey that a permission had been granted to Agha Jaffar to run steamers on the Tigris, and that it was generally believed that the permit would be used to the detriment of the steamers now running on the river by creating unnecessary competition in freights. [2266 g —3]2 4 n I further reminded him that we could not reconcile the position taken up by the local Government, in view of the fact that they gave permission to a comparative stranger in the country, backed up by foreign capital, on the one hand, while, on the other they refused permission to us, with a record of half a century of progressiva work’in the development of Mesopotamia, in spite of our willingness to work on thl same conditions as any other Ottoman subject. i . n ^ -i i Sevian Bey said that a very strong protest had been made at Constantinople by his superiors against the granting of the permission to Agha Jaffar, and he expected it would be withdrawn. +-i j T The conversation turned to the transport of the Bagdad hallway material, and I mentioned that the railway administration had the intention of applying to the Turkish Government for permission to carry general merchandise as well as railway material if they put their own steamers on the river. He said that permission has been asked from the local Government, but he did not think there is the slightest chance of it being granted either locally or at Constantinople. . n t j? -i , I confirm my telegram of to-day’s date, advising you ot the failure ol negotiations with the vali in regard to the reserve steamer, as per translation attached. 6 FRED.

IN reply to your despatch No. 241 of the 1st instant, I have the honour to report that as regards the question of the permission for Messrs. Lynch’s steamers to tow a second lighter, I received a “ notice ” from the Sublime Porte dated the 6th instant, informing me that the Imperial Government had decided to allow the second barge until the 3,800 tons of cargo accumulated at Bussorah had been forwarded, and that the necessary instructions had been sent to the competent authorities. The “ notice ” went on, however, to say that, inasmuch as this permission was accorded in exceptional circumstances, it cannot constitute a precedent, and it must be understood that when the accumulation of cargo had been forwarded, the steamers would not employ barges at all. As this appeared to indicate a desire on the part of the Porte to deny to Messrs. Lynch the right of towing even one barge, I made repeated representations at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs against any such intention, and yesterday spoke very strongly to the Grand Vizier on the subject. His Highness said that the “ notice ” had been badly worded, and that he had not intended to interfere with the one barge. He would, however, look up the correspondence. I fear that if Hakki Pasha does go thoroughly into the question, he will find out that we have no very firm ground to stand on. As you will remember, the permission to tow a barge was obtained by Sir N. O’Conor in June 1899, his request being based on the argument that the lowness of the water in the river made it impossible to load the steamers to their full capacity, but no specific time-limit was set to the authorisation. At the end of the summer season of the same year Sir Nicholas had to protest against an attempt to stop the use of the barges, and in his note verbale to the Porte he strongly insisted on the absence of any time limit. The Porte made no reply, but on the 10th March, 1902, they complained that Messrs. Lynch were still availing themselves of the temporary authorisation conferred in 1899. Sir N. O’Conor (No. 112 of the 11th March, 1902), reported the circumstances to your Department, and recommended that no reply should be made, and approval of this course was given in the Foreign Office despatch No. 94, of the 31st idem. In these circumstances it appears to me impossible to pretend that Messrs. Lynch’s claim to tow even one barge to each steamer rests on anything more then the fact that they have succeeded in doing so, so far as I am aware, continuously and without any other protest on the part of the Turks, except that of March 1902, since the summer of 1899. The question therefore is a delicate one, but I am not without hopes of inducing the Grand Vizier to withdraw the notice of the 6th instant. As regards the employment of Messrs. Lynch’s fourth (reserve) steamer, Mr. Whit tall informed me of the dispatch of Houloussi Bey’s telegram to the Acting Vali of Bagdad of 26th July on the same day. The reply from Bagdad was evasive as to the existence of political objections, but recommended the immediate purchase of three more steamers for the Ottoman company, and the Minister of Public Works seems to have been content to delay a definite decision till the new vali should have taken up his post. Mr. Whittall thinks that in the circumstances it would be useless for me to press the Porte to agree to the reserve steamer being put into service, especially as the recently given permission to tow a second berge robs the argument based on the accumulation of cargo of much of its force. In this opinion I entirely agree, and I think that it would be injudicious to run the very grave risk of encountering a point blank refusal which might prejudice the firm’s chances of a successful application at some future and more propitious occasion. In speaking with the Grand Vizier yesterday, I nevertheless observed, tentatively, and without mentioning the question of the fourth steamer, that it seemed a pity that the Government took so little account of the interests of the merchants, and that the Jdareh-i-Nakrieh were [2180 3]2 unable to cope with tbe volume o^tra^^Hatti^Pasha^said ‘ dd dftatlThldfnitruotS the Yali of Bagdad to maintain the best relations with His Majesty’s consul-general and not to raise questiom^ % (For the Ambassadors^[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] ASIATIC TURKEY ANI) ARABIA.

WITH reference to my despatch. No. 234 of the 10th April last, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Acting Consul at Bussorah relative to the proposed transfer of Agha Jalfer’s steamers from the Euphrates to the Tigris. I may observe that Mr. Matthews appears to be under misapprehension when he states in paragraph 5 of bis despatch that the permission accorded to Agha Jaffer to transfer his steamers from the Euphrates to the Tigris would appear to constitute an infringement of the concession granted to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, which, Mr. Matthews understands, expressly excludes navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates by foreign companies or companies financed by foreign capital, Messrs. Lynch never having obtained anything in the shape of a monopoly. They did, it is true, virtually enjoy, jointly with the Idare-i-Nehrieh, the monopoly conferred on the latter company, which was a Civil List concern, by the ex-Sultan, but that monopoly has since been abolished by the decision of the Constitutional Go\eminent declaring the navigation of the rivers of Turkey open to all Ottoman subjects, and it would be impossible for me to maintain these arguments at the Porte. Agha Jaffer’s association with foreign capital will no doubt be difficult to prove, and Messrs. Lynch and Co. might easily have acted in the same manner as the German firm is now said to be doing had they been disposed to do so. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul Matthews to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 44.) Sir, Bussorah, August 18, 1911. WITH reference to Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 12 of the 18th March last, I have the honour to report, for your Excellency’s information, that it is stated on excellent authority that Agha Jailer has obtained permission from the Ministry of Public Works to transfer his steamers from the Euphrates to the Tigris. Agha Jaffer is said to owe this permission chiefly to the whole-hearted support given to him by Jelal Bey, the late Vali of Bussorah. It appears that Agha Jaffer found it impossible to run his steamers at a profit on the Euphrates on account of the insecurity of the country (my despatch No. 34 of the 30th June) and the heavy toll levied by the riverain Arabs. It is anticipated that the existing river steam-ship companies—the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and the Turkish Idare-i-Nehrieh—will be unable to cope with the large consignments of material which aie expected to arrive shortly for the Bagdad Railway, that freights will be raised, and that steamers on the Tigris will earn large profits. Whether these anticipations are likely to be realised or not, several other natives besides Agha Jaffer are endeavouring to obtain permission to put steamers on the Tigris. I might mention Yusuf Abdul ’Ahad, a Turkish subject enjoying French protection, who about a year ago obtained a permit from Nizam Pasha, ex-Vali of Bagdad, for two steamers on the Tigris. Yusuf Abdul ’Ahad has not seen his way to avail himself of this permit, as by one of the conditions it is revocable at the pleasure of the Government. Pie is now trying to have this objectionable condition omitted. With regard to Agha Jaffer, there is no doubt that he has Persian partners and that he receives financial assistance from the German firm of Wonkhaus and Co., the local agents of the Hamburg-Amerika line. I have the authority of my Russian [2180 4]'A &gt; oollpap-ue for statin^ that Agha Hassan, honorary dragoman of the Russian Consulate, ^tlfa P” S ian object, is a partner of Agha Jailer but it would be more Moult to prove Ao-ha Jaffers association with the Germans, which, however, is certain. P The permission accorded to Agha Jaffer to transfer his steamers from the Euphrates to the Tigris would appear to constitute an infringement ^ nC T e ' S1 ^f ^ranted to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Mesms. Lj c Brothers), which, I understand, expressly excludes navigation on the ligns and Euphrates by foreign companies or companies financed by foreign capital. _ Since writing the foregoing, I am informed that Agha Jaffer s permission contains no restriction as to the number of steamers which he may employ, and that, while giving him the right to navigate on the Tigris, it does not withdraw the right to navigate on the Euphrates. I give this information for what it is wOj.th. I have, &amp;c. W. D. W. MATTHEWS. A A A 4 A*,0 Uy^'u [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s /vJU^ « t 'fy ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

He told me that the telegram sent to the Ministry by the vali denied any necessity for the running of the fourth steamer, especially now that permission had been given you to tow the extra barge. The vali objected to a permission being granted to you to run a fourth steamer on the river, in view of the fact that you had no right to ave more than three steamers running. Houloussi Bey told me that he would bring up the matter to-day if possible before the Council of Ministers and see whether something could not be done , but m the face of the categorical statement of the vali that there was no necessity foi the running of the reserve steamer, it would be difficult for him to give a valid reason foi the permit being granted.

REFERRING to our letter of the 23rd May last on the subject of the accumulation of cargo at Bussorah, I have the honour to inform you that, acting on the permission granted to us through the good offices of His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, we are again running a second barge in connection with our steamers on the Tigris. We understand that the authorities in Constantinople have imposed no time limit on the use of the second barge, and we presume that we shall be permitted to utilise the additional barge until the accumulation has been removed. Our agent in Bussorah, however, reports that the local authorities are now enquiring whether we have yet dealt with the transport of 4,000 tons. These authorities evidently have it in mind to order the withdrawal of the second barge as soon as this amount of tonnage has been removed. In view of the large quantity of cargo now awaiting shipment to Bagdad, which, according to information just received by cable, amounts to 8,100 tons—Turkish company 4,500, Euphrates and Tigris Company 3,600 tons—in addition to 4,500 tons estimated as in transit to the Gulf by ocean steamers, it is manifest that _ any decrease of the river transport for some months to come will cause great loss and inconvenience to owners, more especially to British traders, who deal with 90 per cent, of the traffic. The situation is further complicated by the decrease in volume of water in the river at this time of the year, and the consequent decrease in carrying capacity of the steamers and barges. We hope, therefore, that His Majesty’s Ambassador will bring these facts to the notice of the authorities in Constantinople, and cause such definite orders to be sent to the Yalis of Bagdad and Bussorah as may prevent any interference on their part with the second barge. In order to keep abreast of the increased volume of traffic to the Gulf, we recently applied, through our representative in Constantinople, for permission to run our reserve steamer. On the 26th July we received a telegram from Constantinople to the following effect:— “Minister of Public Works telegraphed the Vali of Bagdad approving running of reserve steamer two months provided no political objection exists.” No effect has yet been given to these instructions owing apparently to the opposition of the Vali of Bussorah.

[30036] No-1- Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Jidy 31.) (No 528.) Sir, Therapia, July 25, 1911. WITH reference to your despatch No. 190 of the 10th instant, I have the honour to report that I had some conversation on the 18th instant with the agent of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company respecting their application for permission to run their reserve steamer between Bussorah and Bagdad. Mr. Whittall informed me that towards the end of June he mentioned the subject to the Minister of Public Works, who, as soon as he understood that what the company desire is a permit to run their steamer under the same conditions as those stipulated for in the permit obtained by Agha Jaffar, declared emphatically that the proposal was inacceptable. It was, he said, tantamount to a permanent permission, and would be in contradiction of regulations which the Ministry of Public Works was about to issue for the regulation of the navigation of the two rivers, which, among other things, provided that the navigation should be reserved entirely for Ottoman companies formed with Ottoman capital and using the Ottoman flag. Mr. Whittall, seeing the futility of this proposal, changed his ground, and said that the Minister was reaching conclusions too hastily, that the proposal he wished to submit to his Excellency was simply a business transaction in the interests of commerce, which was suffering severely from the congestion of transport owing to the inadequate number of steamers. Even this did not at first lull Houloussi Bey s suspicions, but eventually he said that if the company would agree to sign an undertaking to remove the fourth steamer as soon as the accumulation of cargo at Bussorah was worked off he would see what could be done, and he telegraphed in Mr. Whittall’s presence to the Yali of Bussorah to learn his views as to the proposal. The vali, however, in spite of leminders, had not yet replied. Mr. Whittall meantime reported the situation to Mr. Lynch, and expressed the opinion that it would be extremely impolitic to make any proposals to the Turks concealing any ulterior object besides the avowed one, such as he understood was Mr. Lynch’s wish, as the Turks would certainly divine the manoeuvre, and stated his conviction that the only policy that would pay would be one of absolute straightforward dealing. Mr. Lynch replied, in a letter which was shown me with his sanction, demurring strongly to giving the undertaking required by Houloussi Bey, as he feared that by doing so the company would be precluded in future from expanding its operations concurrently with the expansion of the transport trade in private hands.^ He said, however, that if the embassy took a different view, and thought that the signature of the agreement would not prejudice the company’s prospects of continuing to run the fourth steamer, he would be inclined to waive his objections. He also suggested that the embassy might endeavour to persuade the Porte not to issue the navigation regulations above alluded to. After discussing the question in all its bearings with Mr. Whittall, I agreed that in view of the very decided language and obvious suspicions of Houloussi Bey, it would be impolitic to attempt Mr. Lynch’s policy of trying to gain an inch and expand it to an ell, and that a perfectly straightforward policy would probably produce better results, and I asked Mr. Whittall if he wished me to take any action at the Porte. He replied, as I think with good reason, that he feared that, if the embassy showed an active interest in the question, the Turks would see in it some political motives, and that therefore for the present he would prefer to try to treat the question as a purely business transaction with Houloussi Bey without any assistance from the embassy. I also told Mr. Whittall that it seemed to me that Mr. Lynch wished to lay on the embassy the onus of taking a decision whether the company should or should not give the undertaking required by Houloussi Bey, but that was a responsibility which I could not accept, and I also said in reply to his question that if the company gave the undertaking it would be impossible for the embassy to support them if they subsequently [2101 hh —5]A 1 2 Vlv n • -f it appmed to me, however, that on the whole it was tried to avoid compiymg with it It could&gt; to get the permit even if they had to the advantage of the company ^ ^ ^ ob j ectionab l e) as to have succeeded *: fit' x, £S g —, ™»»“t”™ 1 ?-'**p' “'Til *» M, TOMT. *-*»» the effect that His M a J&lt;; st y s Ambassa se cond barge by the company’s steamers, hitherto placed by the Turks Z^^slonZLJ the Porte did not go so ‘Xea b, Mr. whittaii -a .h,i h. ...a call Mr. Lynch’s attention to this point. ,■ jt; s Majesty’s consul-general at On the same day 1 received a ^^dhe Bagdad Rmlway had mentioned to Bagdad, reporting that the German ®“S ln permfesion for the vessels which they him privately that the company aimed at f f convent i on to carry general are entitled to put on the river m Mr Lorimer reported that the ssx sSssa ‘rdX •'*'X® Six ixix in the proper quarter to obtain permission to i , ^ r n Mr. Lorimer added that the agent had referred the proposal to London I informed Mr. Whittaii of these messages, and he thinks that the change oi attitude ofTe German engineer is due to the consideration that the railway company L very anxious to press forlard the work of construction as fast as possible and does not wish to incur the clelay of at least eighteen months, which would be caused by buildi g and bringing out the special vessels suitable for work on the Iigns. _ As the^regulations for the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers have not yet appeared, it is impossible to say yet whether they would bar t e rai way company using its steamers, should it place any on the river, as common carriers but it seems possfble that in view of its status as an Ottoman company the railway could be biou to within the scope of the regulations.

[19397] No. L telegram No.'t'DS of the 12th April, I have the honour to report that I urged on Rifaat(^!nAhrJ Pasha the necessity of allowing the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company to tow two barges, pointing out that Messrs. Lynch had been unfairly treated in the matter of the fusion scheme, that, as the Turkish company had also 2,500 tons awaiting shipment, there could be no question of commercial rivalry, and that it was obviously desirable in the interests of trade to help Messrs. Lynch to work off their accumulation of some 4,500 tons. I hinted that a refusal would be open to an interpretation of unfriendliness, and might unfavourably affect the present pourparlers. After consulting the Grand Vizier and his colleagues, Rifaat Pasha informed me that it had been decided to allow Messrs. Lynch to tow a second barge until the accumulation of 4,500 tons is worked off, and that the limitation was based on the idea of bargaining which, it appeared to him, also animated His Majesty’s Government in the matter of the existing negotiations. It will, however, be difficult for the Ottoman authorities to determine exactly when the last of the 4,500 tons has been shipped to Bagdad, and, in the ordinary course, the permission would seem likely to extend beyond that amount of cargo. Instructions, as reported in my telegram No. 114 of to-day’s date, were sent on the 8th instant to the authorities of Bagdad and Bussorah, and His Majesty’s consul at the latter place informs me that Lynch’s steamer left for Bagdad on the 15th May, towing two barges.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 49 of the 15th instant regarding the permission given to Aga Jafer, an Ottoman subject, for running steamers on the Euphrates, I have the honour to transmit translation of a copy of the permission in question, which was furnished to me privately. I would observe that in this document nothing is said about shareholders’ nationality. It distinctly states, however, that the owner of the steamers must be an Ottoman subject, and it also states that the permission carries no monopoly or concession, that it must not be transferred to foreigners, and that the holder cannot oppose the working of any other applicant. It is clear from my information here that at least three Persians have subscribed to the capital. According to my latest enquiries the present partners in the scheme are :— Aga Jafer ibn Abdul Noby (Turkish), Haji Mohd. Ali ibn Haji Mohd. Taghi Behdeshti (Persian), Aga Mohd. ibn Mirza Abdullah Kazerooni (Persian), Mirza Ah ibn Haji Mollah Hussein (Persian), and the capital is from 20,000/. to 25,000/. I am informed that the other persons mentioned in my despatch No. 30 of the 27th May, 1910, as interested in the concern, are no longer shareholders, but this is not yet confirmed. I see nothing in the wording of the permission to prevent foreign capital being employed, although it may be the intention of the authorities to exclude it, provided the nominal owner of the steamers registered as such is a Turkish subject. In regard to the action of the German firm of Wonckhaus and Go., agents of the Hamburg-American line here, in allowing Aga Jafer to use their premises for the construction of the stern-wheeler steamer which was recently launched, and for that of several barges, which I understand are also for him, I am informed privately that the consideration for this service is the free use by the German firm of Aga Jafer’s steam launch on the river. This may or may not be the case. The capital in the undertaking is, according to my information, under 25,000/., and there is little doubt that the Germans can, now or in the future, advance funds to Aga Jafer if ready money is required. I am taking steps to watch the development of their relations with him, and if anything noticeable occurs I will report further. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW.i Enclosure 2 in No. 1.

You should insist on the permission being given at once in view of the fact that some Turkish steamers have been towing lull complement of barges. Please inform Minister for Foreign Affairs that I am very unfavourably impressed by the unfriendly attitude of the Turkish Government in this and in other matters, which does not appear to augur a satisfactory conclusion of our negotiations with them. [1972 m —1] COPY TO INDIA i SECRETARY’S N°m eS£aa 5^d3 [This Document is the PropeiAy of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] OUE latest information is that we have 4,500 tons, and the Turkish company 2,500 tons of cargo at Bussorah awaiting shipment to Bagdad. Over 80 per cent, of this cargo is British. cargo. If each of our three steamers were allowed to tow their full complement of barges (as some of the Turkish steamers have been doing of late) we should be able to deal with an additional 500 tons a-month, and this would probably suffice for immediate requirements. The only obstacle to fair treatment of commerce in these regions is the refusal of the Turkish authorities to permit us to use the resources we possess. Their own resources are fully employed, and cannot be augmented in less than twelve months. It doubtless suits Turko-German policy to hamper British trade interests in Mesopotamia, for thereby Britain’s claims in regard to the future developments of the region are minimised, and trading opportunities remain in abeyance until such time as the German trader is better able to compete. In accordance with the terms of the railway concession the Bagdad Eailway Company has the right to transport material by way of the Tigris in their own steamers, and it is inevitable that they will try to safeguard the connection between their railway terminus at Bagdad and the Gulf by making this river service permanent. German competition may thus meet us on our own sphere on the river Tigris. It appears, therefore, essential that we should strengthen our position by making good the privilege we claim of utilising our three steamers to their full carrying capacity, i.e., there should be no limitation to the number of barges they should draw. In this connection our agent at Bussorah has advised us by letter of the 10th December as follows :— Mr. Crow carefully examined the files in the consulate regarding the question of towing barges, and found nothing therein that would preclude us from towing two or more barges with each steamer.” We believe there is nothing to preclude our doing so. Sir N. O’Conor, when negotiating for the right of adding a third steamer to our service under circumstances similar to those of the present time, deprecated any reference to barges lest the Turkish Government might seek to limit their number. The very serious state of affairs arising out of this congestion of cargo at Bussorah offers an excellent opportunity for a settlement in the sense indicated. I trust that the Foreign Office will deal with this matter without delay. A question of much greater importance is that of our future position on the water communications of Mesopotamia. The negotiations begun during the last months of Sultan Abdul Hamid’s reign, at the instance of the Foreign Office, for the purpose of effecting an understanding between the Euphrates and Tigris company and the Turkish service, still remain incomplete. The form of the understanding, a fusion of the two companies into an Ottoman company under British control, was determined by the Minister of the Civil List with the approval of the Grand Vizier Hilmi Pasha. Negotiations ceased when the counter- revolution took place, and were reopened by the Cabinet, which took office with Hilmi Pasha as Grand Vizier. An agreement was drawn up and agreed to by the Cabinet, by whom it was passed on to the Chamber for ratification. The Chamber passed a resolution giving the Cabinet power to conclude the agreement, provided no fresh burden were placed on the finances of the country. This proviso had special reference to a clause of the agreement which set forth that, in the event of navigation being destroyed by irrigation, compensation should be paid by Government. This would, it was argued, lead to financial obligation on the part of Government. Proposals ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [April 6.] CONFIDENTLAL. Section 1, [ 12725 ] No. 1 Memorandum communicated by Mr. Lynch, April 6, 1911. The steamers plying on the river are unable to cope with this traffic under present conditions. Meantime much loss is being inflicted on the owners of these 7,000 tons of [1972/—1] COPY TO INDIA |2 were at once made by the Euphrates and Tigris Company for obviating this difficulty. It soon became apparent that the Cabinet wished to shelve the question, and the Foreign Office gave us to understand that further diplomatic pressure was undesirable —in any case for the time being. . . . ^ Circumstances now appear to have changed. Negotiations axe taking place between the British and Turkish Governments on the subject of the Bagdad Bail way, and I gather therefrom that the relations of the two Governments are of a more friendly nature. The question of the Bagdad—Gulf section of the railway, and that oi the grand line of communication by way of the Tigris, cannot, I venture to believe, be treated except as part of one and the same great question. I therefore hope that the time has come for a definite settlement of the original negotiations between the Euphrates and Tigris Company and the Turkish Government, and that it will be found possible to fuse the companies on the lines approved by the Chamber. With a modicum of good will on the part of the Turkish Government, the difficulty of further financial obligation will readily find its solution. H. PICOT.

Sir, ON receiving your despatch No. 60 of the 3rd instant, relating to navigation enterprises in Mesopotamia, I asked His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah, by telegram, if he could ascertain whether the permit granted to Abdul Kader Pasha el-Khadry definitely stated that all the shareholders in the enterprise must be Ottoman subjects. Mr. Crow has replied that he has obtained a copy of the permit, which states that the vessels must carry the Turkish flag and that the owners must be Ottoman subjects. They must further submit to the present and future laws of the Ottoman Empire. Moreover, the permit carries no sort of monopoly, and must not be transferred to foreigners, and there must further be no interference with other applicants for a similar privilege. (The last sentence of Mr. Crow’s telegram is not very clearly worded, but this seems to be its meaning.) It would therefore seem that the strictly legal interpretation of the permission prevents any scheme such as that suggested by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company in their letter of the 22nd February last, but, at the same time, Mr. Crow informs me that the local authorities have closed their eyes fo the fact that five Persians, including the Sheikh of Mohammerah, are shareholders in Aga Jaffer’s concession, and it would obviously be possible for Messrs, Lynch to acquire an interest in the concern by putting in natives as shareholders and holding the shares as security for mortgage, or by one of the many other devices which exist in this country for evading the strict letter of the law. But these are questions which Messrs. Lynch, with their long experience of conditions in Turkey, are better qualified than anyone else to deal with. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

WITH reference to your letter of the 9th ultimo, suggesting that the question of the participation of foreign capital in navigation enterprises on the rivers of Mesopotamia should be cleared up, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to state that the only permit for navigation with regard to which His Majesty’s Government have any detailed information is that granted to Aga Mohammed Jaffar. In this case, it appears, conditions are attached to the permit to the effect that all shareholders must be Ottoman subjects, and that the steamers are not transferable to foreigners. His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Constantinople, to whom your letter has been referred, has observed that your company appears to be under a misconception as to the view taken by the Turkish Government with regard to the rights of foreigners to run non-ocean going steamers on the internal waters of Turkey. Ihe old regime considered vour company’s position as an infringement on the civil list s rights, i.e., the Government monopoly of navigation on the Tigris. The present Government, while refraining from any attempt to deprive your company forcibly of their acquired rights, is determined that the right to ply on the two rivers shall be rigidly confined to Ottomans. Just as His Majesty’s Embassy is poiverless to prevent the infringement of the status quo by the grant of permits to private Ottomans, so any other foreign embassy is equally powerless to obtain for a foreign subject the right to navigate under a foreign flag or as a non-Ottoman company. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. [1851 hh —2] C G2) o Vz-t- [This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.] I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No. 368 of the 24th December, 1910, transmitting copy of a letter from the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company, and asking if there is any objection to giving them the information contained in Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 30 of last year. I see no objection to such a course, and would beg to make the following observations on the company’s letter to you of the 9th December, 1910. The company seems to be labouring under a considerable misconception as to the existing system of government in Turkey, and its views as to rights of foreigners to run non-ocean going steamers oh its internal waters. The old regime considered the company’s position as an infringement on the Civil List, i.e., the Government’s monopoly of navigation on the Tigris, and the present Government, while refraining from attempting to deprive Messrs. Lynch forcibly of their acquired rights, is determined that the right to ply on the two rivers shall be rigidly confined to Ottomans. Just as this embassy finds itself “ powerless to prevent the infringement of the status quo by the grants of permits to private Ottomans,” so any other embassy is equally powerless to obtain for a foreign subject {e.g., a German) the right to navigate under a foreign flag or as a non-Ottoman company. As stipulated in the navigation permit granted to Abdul Kader Pasha El Khedery, such permits “can in no way be transferred to foreigners,” implying that foreigners cannot be shareholders or otherwise participate. It is not clear what “declaration” is alluded to in the last paragraph of the company’s letter, or from whom it is to be obtained, but, if the advent of German capital in the guise of an Ottoman company is possible, it is equally open to Britishers who show the same adaptability as their German rivals, similarly to evade the provisions of the navigation contracts given to “ Ottomans.” His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bagdad recently reported a rumour of the intention of the Turks to withdraw from Messrs. Lynch the privileges of towing the same effect. That privilege, though it has been exercised continuously for some years, as you are aware, was only granted as a temporary measure to enable Messrs. Lynch to work off large accumulations of cargo, and it would therefore seem to be in Messrs. Lynch’s interests that there should constantly be an accumulation of goods at Bussorah, for if there were no such congestion the Porte might seek to withdraw the permission.

Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to Foreign Office.—(Received January 14.) 3, Salter's Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, a- r January 13, 1911. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo on the subiect of our claim for refund of duty on the steamer &lt;; Julnar ” . In reply 1 would point out that it would be fatal to British rights and privileges in Turkey if His Majesty’s Government were to acquiesce in the contention of the Turkish Government that they are not bound by such a long course of established precedents as those upon which this company rely in the present case, on the ground that these precedents were established under a different form of Government to that which has recently been established in Turkey. „ -.x. • » Your despatch suggests that in the case of the ££ Shushan and the Malamir, steamers for use mainly in Persian waters, my board abandoned the claim that a ship in parts remains always a ship and thus impaired the previous precedents. It would have been easy to erect these vessels at Mohammerah in Persian territory, though not equally convenient; and this course would certainly have been followed if any suggestion had occurred to our board or had been brought to their attention that, by erecting these vessels in Bussorah, we should be abandoning or impairing old established British rights upon the Tigris. No such suggestion occurred to my board or was brought to their attention. _ . „ If a ship, whether as a whole or in pieces, is brought within the customs cordon of a foreign State, she would presumably be primd facie liable to duty. If, again, she were exported from within the customs cordon as the same ship, that is to say without materially altering her nature, it might be held that she was liable to pay such duties as micht be applicable to merchandise in transit. If, on the othei hand, slm weie employed upon internal waters upon which the right has been established to ply without payment of duty, we cannot see upon what ground any duty whatever would be leviable upon her. , ^ ^ In conclusion, my board trust that His Majesty s Government realise the seriousness of this question as affecting the interests of the British steameis on the Tigris. In your despatch of the 25th November, you informed us that the Grand Vizier had stated that since the inauguration of the new regime machinery and stores imported in parts, even for Government concerns, have had to pay duty in full, but that fiesh legislation might be enacted to allow a refund in such cases. My board is not aware that the Turkish steamer administration on the Tigris has as yet paid any duty upon then materials. We know for a fact that in the case of coal upon which we pay duty they are not paying any duty whatever, and it would surprise us to learn that they were paying duty upon machinery or steamers. If, while this subject is undei discussion, it might happen that they paid such duty, they would almost ceitamly be exempted by subsequent legislation, while it is extremely improbable that the exemption would be made applicable to us. On these grounds, and also having regard to the effect, upon British rights as a whole of navigating the Tigris, of the abandonment of established precedents, my board trust that His Majesty s Government will eithei insist upon a refund of the duties in the present case as in all previous cases, or will at least direct that a formal protest be lodged at the Porte, so that the question may be raised again when a favourable opportunity arises.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that the accumulation of cargo in our hands at Bussorah, referred to in my letter of the 10th November last, still exceeds 3,000_tons.g e nt telegraplied to us j n t h e beginning of December that the Turkish company had commenced to tow two barges with each of their two largest steamers, and he recommended us to adopt the same practice. He writes to us under date of the 10th December that he went into this question with His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah, and that they found nothing in the records which would preclude us from towing two or more barges with each steamer. Our agent sounded the vali privately on the subject, and found that his Excellency was not disposed to place difficulties m the way. His’Excellency felt, however, that he required authority from Constantinople, and promised to confirm the need of accelerating the transport of cargo in this way if the Porte referred the matter to him. We understand that His Majesty s consul at Bussorah thereupon (on or about the 7th December) telegraphed to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, putting the circumstances of the case befoi e him, and requesting telegraphic instructions from the Porte to the local authorities to put no obstacle in the way. These instructions have not yet been leceived, and the delay is affecting our interests most prejudicially. It is essential that we should have the same facility as the lurks oi towing two barges with each of our steamers, and we shall be greatly obliged if you will request His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Constantinople to press this matter. Our reasons are:— 1. The present accumulation of cargo at Bussorah causes great loss and inconvenience to our customers and hurts trade. 2. If we let the Turks use two barges without claiming equality we have little chance of establishing any such right later, should the practice prove a success. 3. The Turks by using two barges per steamer will be able to increase their carrying capacity by nearly 800 tons per month, which will give them a great superiority over us in future unless we can adopt the same practice. 1 We have elsewhere pointed out that these accumulations, which we are not permitted to deal with, are calculated to tempt competition on the river from other quarters, which would be extremely prejudicial to us, seeing that we are fully qualified to deal with the whole volume of cargo if permitted to do so.

Grey is aware that the precedent of 1877 does not stand by itself, and that the precedents which are material since that date are those of the “ Khalifah ” and the “Mejidieh” in 1880 and 1883 respectively. These vessels were, like the “ Blosse Lynch,” imported into Turkey in pieces for subsequent navigation on the Tigris. on the two latter vessels, and Sir E. Grey therefore assumes that they were exempted on the grounds applicable to the case of the “Blosse Lynch,” viz., that a ship imported in pieces is not merchandise, but is equivalent to a ship, and therefore not liable to duty. But even if the Porte did not refuse on the grounds of which you were inf— late Government, the precedents quoted would still be impaired by the fact tJiat m the cases of the “ Shushan ” and the “ Malamir,” which in 1890 and 1893 were imported in parts into Turkey, fitted together at Maaghil, and re-exported for use wholly or mainly in Persian waters, your company acquiesced in the payment of 1 per cent, transit duty, thereby abandoning the claim that a ship in parts remains always a ship, and admitting that the parts of a ship are merchandise. This admission was also made by your company in the present case of the “ Julnar.” The ship was first destined for use on the Karun, and the company gave notice that they would claim the refund of 10 per cent, out of the 11 per cent, duty exacted.

This is not the case. We have never paid duty on any of our steamers on the Tigris, and, if we were compelled to pay duty on the “ Julnar,” a precedent would be created which would not only considerably diminish the value of our rights, but would also impair those rights as a whole. We therefore trust that His Majesty’s Government will take energetic steps to protect us in this question and to recover the duty.

As regards permits, if His Majesty’s Ambassador should find himself powerless to prevent the infringement of the status quo by the grant of permits to private Ottomans, my board suggest that it would be advisable to clear up the situation as regards the participation of foreign capital in such enterprises. Is such capital admissible^ and is it open to the Ottoman holder of a permit to form an Ottoman company with the participation of foreigners ? If the answer be in the affirmative, are we excluded from participation, and on what grounds ?

Stephen Lynch and Co., at Bagdad, relating to on attempt to divert trade by unfair means from the Euphrates and ligris Steam Navigation Company, of which Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co. are the representatives here,_ to the Turkish Government line of river steamers. The matter is a delicate one ; and it is fortunate that Mr. Parry has been able, in the present case, to adjust it direct with the Turkish local authorities. This is not the first instance of attempted administrative interference by the local government with the operations ot British merchants, as your Excellency will perceive on reference to my despatch No. 768 of the 3rd September, 1910, about their treatment of Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers, British Indian firm of ice manufacturers and general merchants at Bagdad. I have been unable to obtain from the vilayet any reply to a petition submitted through me on the 1st August, 1910, for permission for the establishment by Mr. A. B. Taylor, a British merchant at Bagdad, of a private kerosine store. This permission was sought in accordance with the terms of the Turkish law on the subject. It is to be regretted that the new government of Bagdad should regard British commercial enterprise, as they apparently do, with an unfavourable eye ; but I trust that further experience of the conditions of trade here will convince them of the advisability of aiding rather than of discouraging it. In connection with this subject, 1 would invite your Excellency’s kind attention to remarks contained in my monthly summary for September under the headings VII1 (2) and VIII (3). I have, &amp;c. J.

OUR rate of freight for horses from Bagdad to Bussorah is 5 medjidies, and the rate charged by the Idareh Nahrieh steamers is 7 medjidies. 2. Two years ago we declined to give a commission of 1 medjidieto Seyyid Mejid, a certain horse-broker, and charge shipper 7 medjidies because we considered it unfair business. 3. Permission to ship horses must be obtained from the Mamour Beytar, in order that thoroughbred horses are prevented from leaving the country. 4. Seyyid Mejid arranged to give the Mamour Beytar 1 medjidie per horse and [2988 o-8] : COPY TO INDIA 10J ■ r 5 medjidies per horse to the Nahrieh steamers, and keep 1 medjidie himself on condition of the Government official declining to give a permit for shipment of horses if they are to be shipped by our steamers. 5. An attempt was made to stop horses being shipped by our steamer “ Khalifah ” at Garara by Mr. Eassa Khedery, but he, belonging to a powerful family, got the opposition removed. Later, on the 24th September, a shipper named Abbass took a shipping order from us to ship nine horses, and when he took his horses to be examined at the serai he was asked by what line of steamer he intended shipping; and, on learning that they were to be shipped by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited) steamer, the permit was refused. 6. Attached is a copy of an official letter addressed to his Excellency the Vali, dated the 6th September, on the subject. 7. On the 24th September Mr. Parry personally interviewed Seyyid Bey, his Excellency the Yali’s aide-de-camp, and after much difficulty succeeded in getting him to endorse the permit for shipment of the nine horses belonging to Abbass. During the course of conversation on the subject he threatened to imprison Abbass for complaining against a Government official, and only after Mr. Parry had in a friendly way refused to go out of his office without a promise that the man would not be jmoiested did he agree to let the matter drop.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 894. Very Confidential.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, October 7, 1910. IN continuation of my very Confidential despatch No. 511 of the 18th June, 1910, I have the honour to forward for your information, a copy of a demi-official letter which I have received from Mr. Parry, the agent of Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co., of Bagdad. Your Excellency will observe that Mr. Parry does not say that he encouraged the overtures which were made to him for the secret participation of his firm in an indigenous scheme for starting a steamer service between Bagdad and Mosul, but neither does he state that he refused to entertain them, and I conclude that the matter has probably been left open. It does not appear to me that the desire of a firm of Ottoman subjects to obtain secret financial hacking from Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co. in a navigation enterprise, really bears in any way upon the very different question of the establishment of a navigation monopoly the operations of which would be controlled, through a majority in the directorate, by non-Ottoman subjects. » I have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMER, I. C. S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Mr. Parry to Consul-General Lorimer. Dear Mr. Lorimer, Bagdad, October 2, 1910. IN confirmation of the verbal information given you on several occasions regarding the permissions granted by the local Government to Ottoman subjects to run steamers on the Tigris, I have to report that Mr. Aziz, of Messrs. Shukur and Aziz, a well-known and wealthy firm trading at Bagdad and Mosul, approached me confidentially on the 30th ultimo with a proposal to secretly become interested with them in forming a financial group to exploit a permit to run steamers between Bagdad and Mosul, which had been promised to them. Mr. Aziz said that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the permit, and from enquiries made at Constantinople they learned that it would be confirmed by the central Government provided no foreigners took part in the manage ment of the business. Recently Mr. Abdul Kader-el-Khedery informed me that he expected shortly to hear his permit to run steamers between Bagdad and Bussorah would be ratified. I pointed out to both these gentlemen the futility of obtaining permits to run steamers on a river which in a few years would not contain sufficient water for navigation [2988 o—6] COPY T 1 2 ^ 0 , '■ ' ' c?2 ‘ I i I \ * purposes if the Turkish Government irrigation schemes are carried out in their entirety, but they said that those schemes would not be finished for many years, and perhaps not at all ; consequently they are content to make as much out of the river as they could while the water is in it. In passing on this information, which I beg you to treat with strict confidence as far as regard the individuals named herein are concerned, 1 desire to point out and emphasise the illustration Messrs. Shukur and Aziz’ proposals afford with regard to the views influential natives have of the anti-foreign agitation which has been made so much of in official circles. On one side we have influential Ottoman subjects asking us to assist them secretly in developing the navigation of the rivers, and on the other side we are told that the feeling against us is so strong in Bagdad that an amalgamation of two most important concerns on the river would be prejudicial to the welfare of the country. It would seem obvious, if well-known natives appeal to us for secret assistance in conducting their developing schemes, that they know they cannot conduct them satis factorily alone; and it v ould also seem obvious that, if we do not come to their assistance, other channels are open to them to get secret assistance from foreigners who are endeavouring, with the strong support of their Government, to assail the Britisli position in Mesopotamia.

[41320] No. 1. Foreign Office to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Sir, Foreign Office, December 5, 1910. WITH reference to my letter to you of the 31st October, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform you that he has now received the observations of His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople on your letter of the 13th October on the subject of the interests of your company in the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia. Sir G-. Lowther sees little hope of success for the fusion negotiations under existing circumstances. He has several times pressed the Grand Vizier on the subject, but has invariably been met with the reply that the resolution of the Chamber of Deputies stipulated that the project should not be monopolistic in character, and that it must pass through Parliament if it involved a financial engagement for the Govern ment. The Grand Vizier has recently invited your company’s agent at Constantinople to discuss the matter with him, but Sir G. Lowther does not see how a solution of the difficulty can be attained, as under the fusion scheme a transference to the combined enterprise of the exclusive rights of the Turkish Company has always formed an integral part of your proposals. Sir G. Lowther has endeavoured to prevent the Turkish Government from granting navigation permits to private Ottomans, reminding them from time to time of their pledges given in connection with the fusion scheme, but such a negative policy has not been and in the long run cannot be availing. Sir G. Lowther has lately spoken to the Grand Vizier and to the Minister of Public Works, deprecating the reported grant of permission to Abdul Kader-el-Khedery to place two steamers on the Tigris between Bagdad and Bussorah, but has been informed by both Ministers that they have no knowledge of the matter. Sir G. Lowther points out that the underlying idea which wrecked the fusion scheme was to throw the rivers open to the Ottoman flag by granting navigation permits, and that consequently the applicants for permits must be Ottomans. He therefore thinks it would be useless for your company, as foreigners, to apply to the Central Government for a permit to form an Ottoman company distinct from your own, to ply on the Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries, or to send a tug and barge up the Euphrates with a view to establishing a regular service. I am, &amp;c. W. LANGLEY.[This Boeument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government,] relative to the position of the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company on the rivers of Mesopotamia, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith an extract Irom an article in the “ Tanin ” of the 25th instant, stating that part of the Bagdad municipal loan for 200,000Z. (see my despatch No. 865 of yesterdays date) is to he devoted to the purchase of two steamers for the municipality. Probably the writer of the article has in his mind the vali s scheme for a motor- boat service'to Meskineh, which might perhaps bring Bagdad within twelve days of the capital, a service which would be physically impossible via Bussora . fhe project was mentioned in the August and September summaries from Bagdad enclosed in Sir G. Lowther’s despatches Nos. 726 and 794 of the 12th October and the 2nd November respectively. PART of the loan is to be devoted to the purchase on behalf of the municipality of two 12-knot steamers which will bring Bagdad within twelve days’ post of Constantinople. Sir W. Willcocks maintains that these boats will not be fast enough to make way against the currents at their strongest, and that a faster boat, being of a largei tonnage, would be unable to navigate the river. Although he is most probably wiong m this idea, his words deserve reflection and experiment. [1814 e—2] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [December 5.] CONEIDENTIAL. Skctiok 2. [440351 No. 1. (No. 868.)

I. am to state that in May last His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople addressed a written communication to the Turkish Government claiming a refund of the duty in question on the ground of the precedent of 1877, when the “ Blosse Lynch ” was admitted duty free. Sir G. Lowther has now reported that this question was referred by the Porte to their legal advisers, and further details were called for from Bussorah. The reply was duly communicated to the Grand Vizierate, which, after consideration, has now decided that the precedent of 1877, which occurred under the old regime, could not validly be followed under the new regime, since the inauguration of which all machinery and steamers imported in parts, even for Government concerns, have had to pay duty in full. Sir G, Lowther has pointed out to the Turkish Government, both directly and through Mr. Crawford, that the new practice discourages local industry, and, though some hope is held out that fresh legislation may be enacted to allow of a refuud of duty in such cases, his Excellency reports that there is no chance of a law of the kind being retroactive. In these circumstances, Sir Edward Grey regrets that he is unable to insist any further in the matter. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. [2988 66—1] COPY TO INDIA | !Y’S NT secreta:- ■ ■— usm.

Sir, Pera, November 8, 1910. / I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 326 of the 28th ultimo, by which you transmit to me copy of a letter from the Euphrates and - Tigris Navigation Company, drawing attention to the permits granted to natives for navigation, and enquiring if His Majesty’s Government would acquiesce in their sending a tug and barge up the Euphrates, while further suggesting the formation by them of an Ottoman company to ply on both the Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries. You add that, so long as the position of the company is not threatened by changes in the status quo ante^ you are prepared to leave things as they are for the present, but that you consider it essential to obtain for them such freedom as is necessary to enable them to protect themselves from the evil effects of increased competition. The status quo ante, the fusion negotiations, was that the ex-Sultan’s civil list had a monopoly of the navigation, limited by Messrs. Lynch’s right to run three steamers on the Tigris. When Abdul Hamid was deposed, his civil list properties in those regions were transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and after the breakdown in the Ottoman Chamber of the fusion scheme, the Government monopoly was abolished and the principle adopted of throwing the navigation of both rivers open to Ottomans, Lynch’s acquired position being respected. The status quo ante, as regards Messrs. Lynch, has, therefore, in a way remained unaltered. As regards the mean&amp; of protecting Messrs. Lynch from the evil effects of increased competition, there seem to be three courses 1. To insist on the carrying out of the fusion scheme ; 2. The prevent the Ottoman authorities from granting permits to private Ottomans ; and 3. That Messrs. Lynch should, as suggested in the end of my despatch No. 598 of the 23rd August last, piotect themselves from, or defeat competition by, indirectly obtaining permits locally under Ottoman disguise to run other steamers on the rivers, e.g., on the lines of the overtures for secret partic’pation in a Bagdad—Mosul service reported in Consul-general Lorimer’s despatch No. 55 of the 7th October, forwarded in my despatch No. 817 of to-day’s date. One hears at times of the dreaded German competition under some Ottoman disguise, and it seems inconceivable that Messrs. Lynch with their long established local position at Bagdad should be unable to adopt the same methods as their possible rivals. It is obviously futde for Messrs. Lynch qua foreigners to apply to the Central Government for a “ permit to form an Ottoman company distinct from their own company to ply on the Tigris and Euphrates with their tributaries,” or for a permit to “ send a tug and barge up the Euphrates with a view to establishing a regular service, while it is difficult to understand why either of these projects should necessarily require the acquiescence of, or find favour with, His Majesty’s Government. Messrs. Lynch must be aware, as reported in my despatch No. 598 of the 23rd A.ugust last, that the underlying idea which wrecked the fusion scheme was to throw open the rivers to the Ottoman flag by granting permits, and that consequently the applicants must be Ottomans, i have discussed this latter point with Messrs Lynch’s agent here, who says that he has done his best to impress it on Messrs. Lynch. The natural course would thus be that the application for the permit for the tug and barge on the Euphrates or for a disguised Lynch-Ottoman company for both rivers and tributaries should be made through an Ottoman subject at Bagdad. As regards the second course, viz., endeavouring to prevent the Ottoman authorities from granting permits to private Ottomans, I have tried to obtain this result by reminding the central Government from time to time of the old pledges concerning the fusion sch^ne, but such a negative policy has not been, and cannot be, availing in the [2988 o—3]2 rr iiimir: III IImi— , . . • cT-w^lron in the Grand Vizier and unofficially to the long run.

I have several times pressed the present •Grand Vizier on the subject hut invariably met with the reply that the resolution of the Chamber of Deputies stipulated that the project should not be monopolistic in character, and that, if it involves a financial engagement for the Government it mus pass through Parliament. His Highness has recently requested Messrs Lynchs agent here to discuss the matter with him with a view to finding a way out of these two difficulties, but! fail to see how such a result can be arrived at for, as the letter forming the enclosure to your despatch No. 326 of the „8th October states, the transference to the combined enterprise of the exclusive rights ol the lurkish company has always formed an integral part ot our scheme. . . , . r As will be remembered, the scheme was first discussed with the civil list under the old regime, and, after the change of Government m July 1908, took more tangible form under the Grand Vizierates of Kiamil Pasha and Hussein Hilmi Pasha while, alter the advent to power of the Committee Government, subsequent to the deposition of Abdul Hamid in April 1909, the present Ministers of Finance and pf^ the Interior declared themselves in favour of it, and £C determined to stand or fall by it. i e inside committee, however, evidently came to a different decision, and when their pledges and promises were put to the test in Parliament they went back on their engagements, remained in power and made a scapegoat of Hussein Hilmi Pasha. ^ The public opinion in Bagdad has veered round to a great extent, but £C constitutional turkey is imed. not by majorities, but by a secret oligarchy, and it remains to be seen whether the inside committee has changed its views, Should the committee by any chance fall from power and Hilmi Pasha hold a prominent place in the new Cabinet, the fusion project, with perhaps some modifications, would undoubtedly stand a good chance of being realised. In the meantime, as stated above, Messrs. Lynch’s only way of combatting increased competition would seem to be for them to obtain permits locally under Ottoman disguise. I have, &amp;c.

WITH further reference to my letter of the 13th ultimo on the subject of navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, 1 am directed by my board to call your attention to the fact that, in any conversations which may be taking place between His Majesty’s Ambassador in Constantinople and the Porte on this subject, recent circumstances have thrown into relief the undoubted strength of our case. As I informed you in my recent letters, there are now over (&gt;,000 tons of cargo, almost exclusively British and Indian, detained at Bussorah for want of proper facilities of transport to Bagdad. My board is prepared to put a fourth steamer, with barges, on the Tigris run at once, in order to deal with this accumulation. The position, therefore, is that the Turkish Government, having refused our offer to effect a iusion between the two existing companies and at once to add to the tonnage on the river in the name ol the joint concern, has failed to put additional tonnage on itself. We are informed that it is not in a position to put on such additional tonnage, and, even if it were, my board would count upon the support of His Majesty’s Government in securing that the British company should be accorded equal facilities. I am to add that nothing whatever has been done by the Turkish Government to improve the course of the Tigris, which you will remember was one of the objects of the fusion scheme. This fact, and the stoppage of British and Indian cargo at Bussorah, would seem to indicate a deliberate attempt to strangle British trade in order to pave the way for a German monopoly of transport by means of the Bagdad Railway. We are confidentially informed by our representative in Constantinople, under date of the 3rd instant, that he has been given to understand that the Council of Ministers will without delay ratify the permits given by the Yali of Bagdad to native subjects to put steamers on the river. A considerable time must of course elapse before these steamers can be built and put on. A permit to ply between Bussorah and Bagdad has teen granted by the vali to a certain Abdul Kader-el-Khedery, and we understand that this gentleman is in close touch with the agents of the German Hamburg- America Line. In our despatch of the 13th ultimo, cited above, we detailed the various courses which seemed to us open to His Majesty’s Government to pursue in dealing with the present grave situation. We did not there exclude application in the name of a native for a permit to run steamers under the Ottoman flag, in which we should have a controlling interest, but we would point out that this course would— 1. Not meet the needs of the existing situation, and would probably entail delays and difficulties in its execution ; and 2. Would almost certainly involve the appearance of German interests on the river. Permission to the present British company to add to its tonnage would, on the other hand, supply the necessary facilities at once, and might have the effect of preventing the disturbance of the status quo on the rivers.

A point 1 venture to present for your consideration in this connection is that when the Turkish steamers are unable for a period, as in this instance, to deal with the usual quantity of mercantile cargo, or are unable to cope with an expanding trade, the British company is debarred from relieving the situation, although five-sixths of the consequent loss and inconvenience falls on British commerce. Further, our position is hard, in that we undergo the expense of maintaining a fleet sufficient to cope with accidents and fluctuations of trade, but are not allowed to make full use of it at times like the present, when a congestion of traffic can be pointed to as a reason for railway facilities, or for fresh navigation concessions, hostile to ourselves. - ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA [November 1.] CONFIDENTIAL. 16 NOVI 910 Section 1, [39789] The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to Foreign Office .— (Received November 1.)

Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to Foreign Office.—(Received October 18.) 3, Salter's Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, Sir, October 13, 1910. MY board have had under consideration the present state of affairs in connection with the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris. They regard the situation with great anxiety. A native steamer service on the Euphrates was commenced in May 1909 ; and between that time and the 6th August. 1910, twenty-seven round trips have been accomplished and upwards of 4,000 tons of cargo carried. On the Tigris above Bagdad a permit of navigation has been granted by the Turkish Government to a native firm, who have commenced a service with a stern-wheel steamer called the “ Dijleh.” Between Bagdad and Bussorah a similar permit has recently been granted to another native to run two steamers. We understand that foreigners are not precluded from joining in these enterprises; but we are informed on the authority of the Minister for Public Works in Constantinople that care will be taken to secure that we shall not participate in them. By my letters of the 3rd June and 20th July, 1910, to which I have not yet had the honour of a reply, I have already communicated with you on the subject generally of the present letter. My board are still prepared to send a tug and barge up the Euphrates with a view to establishing a regular service, and would like to know that His Majesty’s Government acquiesce in this. We have received communication of a letter addressed by you to Mr. H. F. B. Lynch on the 28th July, and of bis reply of the 30th July, on the subject of the recent abortive negotiations for the fusion of the navigation interests on the rivers of Mesopotamia. We understand that the matter was discussed on the 20th ultimo with Lord Hardinge by Colonel Picot, and that it is not denied that pressure was brought to bear upon this company by the Foreign Office with a view to our obtaining control over the Turkish service in order to stave off similar action on the part of the German interests. We were informed that if we held back others would receive the support of the Foreign Office in taking our place. It was in response to this pressure and at the express instance of the Foreign Office that negotiations were commenced for the acquisition of the Turkish fine. It is quite true that the form of the acquisition did not emanate from the Foreign Office. It emanated from the Turkish Government, who refused to give us control over their service unless we formed an Ottoman company into which the British and the Turkish services should be fused. Their proposal was carefully considered by|His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and was referred by Colonel Picot personally to Sir Charles Hardinge in the spring of 1909. It required consideration, as it involved the disappearance of the British flag. It was decided on behalf of His Majesty’s Government to support the proposal, provided that we obtain control of the combined companies. 1 am to add that the transference to the combined enterprise of the exclusive rights of the Turkish company has always formed an integral part of our scheme. Indeed, such transference was the only way in which we, or any other parties, could effect the object of the Foreign Office, namely, to prevent a disturbance of the status quo on the river by the advent of German interests. My board consider it the more necessary to invite your attention to the origin of the negotiations, inasmuch as it serves to throw light upon the existing situation. If German interests acquire control of the Turkish Government steamers the concern with its exclusive rights will pass to them, barring the way to an extension of our operations to meet the increased competition. If, on the other hand, we were to acquire control of the concern without the exclusive rights, German interests would certainly claim permission to form an Ottoman company on the rivers, and the object which the Foreign Office had in view would be defeated, it seems important that this should be clearly realised. There seems to be no present likelihood of the Turkish Government giving us control of their line with or without a fusion with our own company unless His Maiesty’s [2930 s—5]9 Dreparerl to hold them to the pledges and promises given in connection ^ TTAYf, ViPRt, murse would be to require We are quite prepared to form such at Ottoman company, but it is obvious that the Turkish Government wonld not even consider our application in view of the rebuffs to which we have recently been obliged to submit at their hands. If, therefore, this be the course favoured by His Majesty’s Government, my board would request that an intimation may be conveyed to the Turkish Government by His Majesty s Government, which would render probable their compliance with the application. In conclusion, my board feel that the labour bestowed by them during the last two years in connection with the negotiations with the Turkish Government, their leadi- ness to make concessions in order not to prejudice the success of these negotiations, and the expense to which this company has been put, entitle them to the strong support of His Majesty’s Government in finding an issue out of a situation which is one of grave menace to long-established British interests. The cost of the negotiations has amounted to the considerable sum of 3,6771 9s. 3d,, the details of which I enclose herewith.* I have, kc. H. W.

No. 218^' of the 28th July, asking for my opinion as to the likelihood of the Ottoman Government consenting to “ the removal of existing restrictions on the Euphrates and Tigris Company’s rights or to the explicit recognition of their right to ply on both rivers up to the limit of their navigability.” The largely artificial agitation engineered by certain members of the committee against the fusion scheme has no doubt considerably died down since the scheme practically foundered in the Ottoman Parliament. The resolution then passed authorising the Cabinet to conclude the matter with the proviso that it did not involve any financial engagement on the Turkish Treasury was mainly a manoeuvre to avoid the fall of the Hilmi Pasha Cabinet in a way that might have risked the positions of the committee members, Djavid Bey and Talaat Bey, and was never carried to nor received the sanction of the Senate. At the time the opposition was mainly directed against the monopolistic character of the project, but the underlying idea with the Bagdad committee deputies was that the rivers should be thrown open to the Ottoman flag and Lynch’s company be strictly limited to their existing rights, while hopes were entertained of eventually running them off the river. There has been no change yet that would justify a hope of those rights being extended either as regards the number of Lynch’s steamers on the Tigris or their being permitted to ply on the reaches above Bagdad or on the Euphrates, though it is not impossible that Lynch’s new agent at Bagdad may be able to arrange unofficially to get permit to run other steamers on the rivers in conjunction with native Ottomans and under the Ottoman flag whenever the rivers are thrown open to Ottomans.

Your Excellency is aware that I have informed the company that I cannot at present press the Turkish Government to carry the fusion into execution. It is, however, reasonable that they should be freed from restrictions if exposed to unlimited Turkish competition on the rivers, and this consideration can be urged with the more force if the Turkish opposition to the fusion scheme is based on its monopolistic character. Indeed, to set the company free to compete is the reverse of granting a monopoly. It is true that the Turkish Government have undertaken to grant no further navigation permits on the Mesopotamian rivers for the present, but this undertaking on their part does not appear to be of a definitive nature, and, on the other hand, Aga Jaffar seems to have had a steam-boat on the Euphrates for some time. It also appears possible that other Turkish persons or firms may have already acquired the right to navigate the rivers. I shall be glad to learn whether, in your Excellency’s opinion, there are any It is, however, impossible for His Majesty’s Government to put themselves in the position of urging the Euphrates and Tigris Company to begin negotiations on these lines, and the initiative must proceed from them.

Sir:- By direction of my Board I enclose a memorandum embodying our views upon the present phase of the Steamer question on the Euphrates and Tigris.

Maclean. Secretary. The Under Secretary o? State for Foreign Affairs.MEMORANDUM. EUE1RATES AMD TIGRIS STEAMER Al/ALGAIMTION . No effect having yet been given by the Turkish Government to the Resolution passed by the Chamber in December last, empowering the Cabinet to conclude the Amalgamation Scheme provided it placed no financial burden upon the Turkish Budget, and in view of the fact that other vested interests on the Euphrates and Tigris are in process of being created, it becomes necessary to review and to realise the present situation. The Turkish Cabinet appear to be resolved to dis regard the Resolution of the Chamber, and to have adopt ed the standpoint taken up by the German Ambassador in Constantinople before the close of last year in conver sation with our representative in Constantinople, Colonel Picot, that no monopoly of navigation ought to be permitted. It is, however, easy to demonstrate that this is a Geman rather than a Turkish standpoint, and that, though Germany might no doubt expect to gain by its acceptance, the Turkish Government and Ottoman in terests would certainly suffer. TheThe Amalgamation Scheme is not in the nature of a monopoly pure and simple. It contemplates among other things the improvement of the existing navigation as mil as its extension to Meskene on the Euphrates and Mosul on the Tigris - extensions which the Turkish Gov ernment itself proposed. These features of the scheme have necessitated guarantees in the nature of exclusive rights for steam navigation. Moreover, the exclusive portion of the rights are terminable at certain periods, by the will of the Turkish Government. These provisions, of which the effect would be to furnish the requisite security for capital to be em ployed in developing the enterprise, would, by improv ing and opening up the navigation, confer substantial boons upon a very large area of the.Ottoman Empire. If Ottoman subjects would in this way greatly benefit by its adoption, the direct interests of the Turkish Government in the navigation of the rivers would also be safeguarded and promoted. At present, traffic on the river is equally divided between the British Company and the Turkish Government steamers. If the Turkish Cabinet decides against exclusive rights. theirtheir existing fleet of steamers and the revenues which they derive from their use will hecome of little or no value. Other steamers will appear upon the river like mushrooms; and, while the capital employed in these com peting steamers would naturally he inapplicable to works of development, the steamers themselves would run the present Turkish steamers off the river. On the other hand, German capital would he given an opening on the river. The fact, too, that the Euphrates and Upper Tigris would he likely to remain in their present most unsatisfactory condition, would pre vent the Baghdad railway from being exposed to serious competition on the part of cheap water carriage on the Euphrates and Tigris. The question of what measures should he adopted to safeguard British interests and to save the Turkish Cabinet from the consequences of their present policy, which they would not appear to realise as clearly as they were realised by Hilmi Pasha, is of course a ques tion for His Majesty’s Government. The Minister of Finance, Javid Bey, is shortly to arrive in London, and his visit offers a favourable opportunity for its dis cussion. It may be suggested, however, that if the Minister— ■ . . € ———■Minister were given clearly to understand that British assistance in economic questions ^ including the 4 per cent increase in the Customs question, could not he ex pected until a satisfactory issue had been given to the navigation question, this might at least have the effect of preventing the existing Cabinet from giving away the whole position on the rivers by allowing other vested interests to grow up upon them before a final solution has been arrived at. It is even probable that, in spite of the present tendencies of the Turkish Cabinet, a satisfactory solution would be found by the Minister of Finance, provided that he were made to feel that the British Grovernment had made up their minds to secure such a solution.copy THE EUPHRATES &amp; TIGRIS STEAM NAVIGATION COMPANY, LIMITED.

It will be within your recollection that our proposals were under negotiations at Constantinople during practically the whole of last year. They received the full support of His Majesty’s Embass)-. Our representative in Constantinople now informs us that they will probably be reopened very shortly. Those who were opposed to the scheme in Constantinople, and who were headed by the deputy, Sassoon Effendi, did their utmost to arouse native opposition at Bagdad and Bussorah; and while the negotiations were in progress the deputy, Sassoon, journeyed up the Tigris to Bagdad and employed his activities in arousing the suspicions of the local notables and merchants. We were under the belief that His Majesty’s consul-general in Bagdad was well aware that our proposals were being strongly supported by the embassy at Constantinople. It therefore caused us no little surprise to learn from our agent in Bagdad quite recently that this was not the case. Writing on the 9th April of this year, Mr. Parry states :— “ I asked Mr. Lorimer to give me his opinions, and whether he would lend us his assistance in counteracting the misrepresentations which had been publicly made; also whether he would be inclined to privately advertise the true character of the scheme to influential people in Bagdad with whom he came in contact. “ Mr. Lorimer, in reply, informed me that he had quite an open mind on the question, and that he could not take any active steps in connection therewith until he knew the position His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople had taken up. “ He further said that, with the exception of a few demands for information from the embassy, he had no official cognisance of the scheme. “ He led me to believe that the strong excitement which arose in Bagdad in December last out of our negotiations could easily be revived, and might be a source of danger while the Turkish authority in Bagdad is so weak.” Under these circumstances, my board trusts that you may be willing to give effect to our request that the necessary instructions may now be sent.

He said that he was very anxious not to do anything that might run counter to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government as to the interests of the Lynch Company. He had heard that a native company under the auspices of the Sassoons of Bagdad had obtained the right to run steamers. He enquired, if this was the case, what view would His Majesty’s Government take of his firm securing a share in their enterprise, and, should it not be true (and at a subsequent interview he told me he had found it was not true), would His Majesty’s Government have any objection to his firm endeavouring to secure a right to run steamers, probably under the denomination of a Turkish company. I explained that Messrs. Lynch’s negotiation for a fusion with the Hamidieh Company were in abeyance for the present owing to the delay by the Chamber in passing the concession law.

WITH reference to your letters of the 1st and 20th December last, respecting the annulment of the rights of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, which is desired by the Turkish Government in connection with the negotiations for the amalgamation of the navigation interests on the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform you that he has carefully considered, in consultation with the Law Officers of the Crown, the question whether, in the event of the proposed concession being granted and subsequently withdrawn by the Turkish Government, His Majesty’s Government would concur in the view expressed by Mr. W. F. Hamilton, K.C., that the company would be entitled to restitutio in integrum or to equivalent compensation. If the matter be treated as one between two British subjects and to be decided according to British law, there is not, Sir E. Grey is advised, any ground on which the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company conld as of right demand the restitution of the status quo ante in the event of the withdrawal of the new concession by the Turkish Government. Such a withdrawal would, in English law, amount to a breach of contract for which full pecuniary compensation would be awarded, but for which, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation inducing the contract, restitutio in integrum would not be granted. Further, in this case the remedy could only be obtained in the Turkish courts, except in the very unlikely event of the Turkish Government submitting to the jurisdiction of an English court, and even if the Turkish Government did submit, the governing law would be the Turkish law, and it does not appear whether, by that law, there is any remedy against the Government or in what circumstances the Government might be entitled, notwithstanding the articles of the concession, to withdraw it. Although there may be no legal or equitable right enforceable in a court of law or equity to restore the status quo, Sir E. Grey is of opinion that the company might, in the event of a withdrawal of the concession, claim a restoration of the status quo by a direct representation to the Turkish Government on the ground that the company^ had entered into the contract and had consented to the annulment on^ the faith of the condition that the concession should be continued for the specified time, and therefore that the withdrawal of the concession was a breach of faith towards them. In the event of such a representation being made His Majesty s Government would be prepared to consider the question of giving it their support, although they cannot of course pledge themselves as to their attitude before the case arises. Should His Majesty’s Government be asked to give their assent to the annulment of the existing British rights they would state that they were only prepared to do so subject to the condition that the new concession was continued for the prescribed time, and that if the concession were withdrawn before the prescribed time or if t e new company were dissolved, the English company, which it is understood is to continue m existence throughout the period of the concession, would be restored to the rights and privileges which they enjoyed before the annulment. ^ ^ LOUIS MALLET.3^r His Britannic Majesty’. r T nv Pr , nlo „ t1 ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [17341] S»r 0. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 17.) (No. 284.) ^ ' ^ ir ’ t xj a -m k , , . Pern, May 4, 1910. I the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No. 109 of the 30th ultimo m which you instruct me to make representations to the Ottoman Government on the subject of the customs duty claimed on the new steamer being placed on the Tigris by Messrs. Lynch, referring to the action taken in the case of the £ ‘ Blosse Lynch ” m 1877, and to enquire on what grounds the Customs authorities have required a duty m the present case. 1 1 have, in my despatch No. 245 of the 26th ultimo, reported to you what has occurred in connection with this new boat, informing you that, while it had been arranged that only 1 per cent, should be charged on the vessel whilst it was intended for use in Persian waters, the embassy had instructed His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah that he could not assist Messrs. Lynch in obtaining exemption if they changed their intentions and decided to keep it on the Tigris, and that if the firm believed they had a right to such exemption, it was for them to prove their claim. I have the honour to enclose herewith copies of the correspondence which have passed between the embassy and Mr. Crow on this point. This decision ^ was based in great part upon the despatch to which you refer me, namely Sir P. Currie’s No. 91, Commercial, of the loth November, 1894, which deals with the settlement of the case not ol the “ Shushan,” but of the “ Malamir ” on which the full duty had been paid, but on which in the event only a transit duty of 1 per cent, was levied, the remainder being remitted on the ground that the boat was for use solely in Persian waters. This argument was fully developed in Consul-General Modeler’s despatch to your office, No. 1, Commercial, of the 4th May, 1894. The enclosures in this despatch explicitly show that Messrs. Lynch paid the 8 per cent, under &lt;f protest and claimed a refund of 7 per cent, directly she should be re-exported” ; that the “Shushan” was erected under exactly similar circumstances, and that in this case also the excess duty over 1 per cent, was recovered because it was intended exclusively for Persia ; and that Messrs. Lynch (in their letter dated the 12th February) stated that they desired to put forward the claim to a refund on the “ Malamir ” in the form of a special and exceptional case. This aspect of the case is further emphasised by Messrs. Lynch’s letter of the 9th March, 1894. As it is admitted that this new steamer is for use on the Tigris, i.e., exclusively in Turkish waters, it would appear that it is destined for use in Turkey no less than any other object imported into this country, such for instance as a motor-car, or machinery for a mill. And, on this principle, in the case of several steamers which have within the last few months been imported from France for the purpose of plying on the Bosphorus, and came out not in pieces but whole, the full duty of 11 per cent, has been levied and paid. Before replying to the application made through Mr. Crow by Messrs^ Lynch, the archives were carefully searched as far back as the year 1884 but without discovering a satisfactory precedent, and it was not until receipt of your despatch under reply that the embassy were aware of the precedent of 1877, when the Porte admitted the 4 Blosse Lynch ” to enter duty free whether whole or in pieces. I am taking steps to endeavour to induce the Ottoman Government to adopt the same view as they did at that time, but it must be borne in mind that during the thirty-three years which have since elapsed, circumstances have altered very considerably, especially with the introduction of the new regime, under which no department has been so thoroughly reorganised and reformed as that of the Customs. It will be solely on the precedent ol 1877 and not on principle nor on the practice of recent times that success must be hoped for m the present application. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

Lynch Brothers, asking for special facilities at the custom-house, in ^ respect of rebate of customs duty on the material imported into Bussorah for constructing a new steamer for the Karun service. Messrs. Lynch Brothers have to build the vessel in their dock at Maaghil, and do not expect to be able to complete her within the prescribed period of six months allowed by the Customs regulations for claiming the rebate of 10 per cent, on the import duty. They ask for an extension of this period in their favour and enquire whether they may be allowed to claim the rebate when the vessel is launched in Bussorah Harbour, in which case they propose to complete the steamer afloat, and only re-export her when complete. On enquiry at the custom-house I am informed that the Mudir is forwarding Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ request for an extension of time to the Nezaret at Bagdad, and that, according to the regulations, a rebate cannot be claimed when the steamer is launched here, but only on her departure from this port. As the duty deposited is over 2,000/. I trust your Excellency may be able to assist the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to obtain facilities for completing their steamer here, without losing their right to the rebate. The vessel is intended for service in Persian waters, but the Company is compelled to put her together in Turkish territory as no facilities exist at Mohammerah for the purpose. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Messrs. Lynch Brothers to Consul Crow. Sir, Bussorah, November 12, 1909. WE beg to inform you that the material and machinery for a new steamer, intended for our service on the Karun, has just arrived upon which we have paid 11 per cent, deposit duty amounting to 220,181 G. S. piastres, to the Bussorah custom-house authorities as per receipts enclosed herewith, which kindly return after inspection. Although intended for service in Persian waters we have to erect this vessel at Maaghil dock, as there are no facilities at Mohammerah for this purpose. The Mudir of the Bussorah custom-house informs us that the question of refund of deposit duty, when the steamer is completed, has to be referred to Bagdad and Constantinople, so we shall be obliged, if you will put the facts before His Majesty’s ambassador at Constantinople to prevent difficulties being raised when application is made for the drawback of 10 per cent, from the amount advised above. In 1890 the “ Shushan ” was built at Maaghil and also the “ Malamir ” in 1892 but as both these vessels were completed within six months, there was no difficulty in obtaining the refund, and 1 per cent, transit duty only was charged. The present vessel, however, is very much larger, and there is a doubt as to whether she will be completed within the prescribed period of six months according to the regulations May we beg you to draw the attention of His Majesty’s ambassador to this point with a view to ascertaining the intention of the custom authoritities at Constantinople regarding the drawback of 10 per cent, in the event of the steamer not beincr completed We should also be glad to know whether the drawback can be claimed on the date the vessel is launched on the Shatt-el-Arab or only when she leaves for Persian waters. If the drawback is reclaimable on the date she is launched we could complete her after she is afloat without the inconvenience of having her towed together with material, to Mohammerah for that purpose. ’ ° We have, &amp;c.

They have ultimately, however, extended the period allowed to seven months, and the Customs Department have written to Bagdad in their No. 451 of the 20th January, 1325 (2nd February, 1910) (poussola enclosed), instructing the head of the Customs to allow the extra month, within which period it is hoped the vessel will be completed.

While thanking you for your kind assistance in this matter we are pleased to inform you that, contrary to expectations, the work of construction on this vessel has been so far accelerated that we hope to have her launched before the end of this month. In this case there will be no question of extending the usual period as we hope to apply for the rebate well within the limit of six months. We have, &amp;c. (For Lynch Brothers), SAML.

In that case is there any reason why 11 per cent, should not be paid on imported material ? Lynch alleged no duty was paid in the case of their two steamers which were built here more than twenty-five years ago. Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Consul Crow. (Telegraphic.)

Constantinople, April 26, 1910. I HAVE the honmir to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No 99 of the 19th April, instructing me to inform the Ottoman Government that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company propose to replace the steamer “ Blosse Lynch ” by the new boat which is now in process of construction. J The new steamer already has a long history. The materials for its construction were imported into Bussorah so that they might be put together at Maaghil; and as at that time Messrs. Lynch had the intention of re-exporting it when complete for use on Karun, and as they did not think it would be possible to complete it within the time (six months) which is allowed by the Customs regulations for obtaining the rebate of 10 per cent, on the import duty, they solicited the assistance of the embassy in procuring a prolongation of time. As a result of repeated representations an extra period of one month was allowed, and the authorities at Bussorah informed accordinglv. It then appeared that Messrs. Lynch had decided not to send the boat to the Karun but to keep it on the Tigris, and they enquired whether any duty was payable, alleging that they had paid none on the two steamers they had put together at Bussorah about twenty-five years ago. They were informed that in this the embassy could not assist them, and that if they believed they had a right to exemption it was for them to press their claim. On the 8th instant I received a telegram from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah, stating that secret orders had been received there from the Minister of the Interior not to allow the company to run this new steamer, but it eventually transpired that the vali had informed Constantinople that the company had intended to run four instead of three steamers, and that it was on this intelligence that the orders had been sent. Mr. Crow explained to him his mistake, and told him that the consulate would notify the authorities before the new steamer began to run. The difficulty therefore now seems to be surmounted, and under the circumstances I venture to suggest that it is no longer necessary to inform the Porte on the matter, as instructed by you in your despatch No. 99 of the 19th instant.

Bungalows for the European engineers are to be built at once near these places His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad confirms these statements of the Ministry. The Ministry added, however, that though this was the scheme for the current year, it was necessary to make allowance for Sir William Willcocks, who, they find, is liable to alter^ his mind and their plans : be had, for instance, just discovered that he had omitted in his estimates an item of 700,0001., and had telegraphed to have it inserted. They are somewhat displeased at what they term Sir William’s eccentricities, for they find them puzzling. The cost of the above-mentioned work is estimated at 700,000k to 800,000k, but only 164,000k will be spent during the present financial year, though it is proposed to undertake a more extensive programme next year involving an expenditure of 2,000,000k or perhaps 3,000,000k, tenders being invited for the work. The schemes next projected are :— 1. The construction of a dam at Fellujah ; 2. The construction of irrigation canals running from the Euphrates ; and 3. The construction of a dam at Kut for the purpose of feeding the Hai Canal. With the exception of the last named, the whole of these works are on the Euphrates, which cannot be said to be navigable even now. The dam however at Kut would affect the navigation of the Tigris, but, as Mr. Lorimer observes, it would be possible to defer the execution of this project, should the interests of navigation seem more important than those of irrigation. Mr. Lorimer expresses the opinion that Sir William Willcocks is prone to exaggerate the incompatibility of these two interests, and certainly the example of Egypt tends to show that they are closely allied.

GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Cree to Consul-General Lorimer. Dear Mr. Lorimer, Bagdad, February 26, 1910. I WISH just once more to trouble you on the subject of the Lynch amalgamation scheme. I send you herewith a copy of the “Spectator” of the 22nd January, in which you will find an article on the subject. The impression given by this article, viz., that the Turkish company was blighted when it was taken over by the Sultan Abdul Hamid ; that it is now in a state of decay ; that it now leaves goods to lie for months in Bussorah—seems to have been the general impression in England and Europe. The Turkish Government must have known the true facts of the case, but it probably suited them to conceal this from the public, as it is hard to see how otherwise they could have justified the scheme. Did the British Government know them, or was it misled by representations ? I, of course, expect no answer to this question; but as the point is a most important one, and practically all our case hinges on it, I wish to put the true facts before you in a word or two. When the steamers were taken over by Abdul Hamid the fleet consisted of four old boats with a total carrying capacity of about 600 tons. These boats were all in a disgraceful state of disrepair. Since then four fine new steamers have been added to the fleet, two built in Scotland, the “Hamidieh” and “ Burhanieh,” and two in Belgium, the “ Baghdad ” and “ Busreh ” ; many new barges have been built, and two of the old steamers have been repaired. The fleet now consists of six steamers with a total carrying capacity of about 1,300 tons, and it cannot be too strongly insisted that it is owing to this great improvement in the Turkish fleet, and the fact that the management persistently refused to combine with the Lynch Company to keep up freights, that we owe the present improved conditions on the river. It is generally believed here that the raison d'etre of the whole scheme is the declining profits of the Lynch Company, which for the first time in its history has had to face serious competition. What inducement was offered to the Turkish Government can only be a matter of surmise. I have nothing to do with this. My object is to make sure that the British Government know the true facts of the case. I am, &amp;c. T. D. CREE.

I have the honour to forward enclosed, in continuation of my letter No. of the 31st January 1910, a protest which I have received from Mr. T. D. Cree, 'V a British merchant at Baghdad, against a monopoly of steam navigation on the Tigris which, it is supposed here, is not unlikely to be granted by the Turkish Government. The protest consists of the following documents:— (1) A letter from Mr. Cree to me, dated 17th February 1910; (2) An excerpt from Truth of date 22nd December 1909; (3) A letter from Mr. Cree to the Editor of Truth, dated 17th February 1910. 2. Mr. Cree is a partner in the British firm of Messrs. Blockey, Cree &amp; Co., one of the most enterprising European concerns in Turkish’Iraq; and he is at the present time their local representative at Baghdad. Personally he is a highly respected, experienced, and (I believe) successful man of business; and this and the studiously correct attitude which he maintained during the recent “ Affaire Lynch ” agitation at Baghdad, to which I can myself testify, entitle him, in my opinion, to a careful hearing. 3. I have ventured to inform Your Excellency by telegram of the submis sion of the present protest and to suggest a delay I trust that, in doing so, I have not overstepped the proper limits of my action in a case in which I have not received Your Excellency’s instructions nor an indication of the policy of His Majesty’s Government. I appreciate the fact that the expected concession may have wider bearings than are apparent at Baghdad, and I have therefore abstained from comment in submitting the protest of Mr. Cree. Dated Baghdad, the 17th February 1910. From-~T. D. Cree, Esq., To—J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad. When there was so much excitement here over the Lynch concession, I entirely abstained from joining in the agitation against it though I was pressed by many native friends to take a part. I thought the spectacle of British merchants agitating against what were supposed to be British interests, strongly supported by our Government, would be unedifying and undesirable. Now, however, the conditions have altered, the public believe that the scheme is dead and all excitement is over. There are others, however, possibly better informed, who believe that the scheme is only dormant and will be revived as soon as the time is thought favourable. I therefore feel that silence On the subject is no longer necessary or desirable. I have accordingly taken as my text a paragraph in Truth of 22nd December last (which you have seen) 3275 F . D.3 I &lt;s Now, tlie ne'ws of the contemplated fusion of the two companies, or rather, what it practically amounted to, the absorption of the old Hamidieh Company (present Nahrieh) by the Lynch Company, was received in Mesopotamia with a feeling amounting to consternation which quickly broke into open and determined opposition. Meetings of protest were held in every town between Moosul and Basrah, the telegraph offices were besieged by crowds of people demanding telegraphic audiences of the Ministers at Constantinople and the excitement and feeling generally far exceeded that caused by the events herald- ing the advent of the new regime which left the great hulk of the people indifferent. There was not one section of the population, scarcelv I may say, one man in Mesopotamia, who was not heart and soul against the scheme and with the feelings of the population the Turkish official world, and also the foreign communities, British and others, for the most part thoroughly sympathised. For probably the first time in the modern history of Mesopotamia, Mahommedans of both sects (Shia and Sunni) were brought into line with Christians and Jews. On every side w r ere heard expressions of astonishment and regret that the British Government should have lent its support to the scheme and this feeling was accentuated by the fact that our Government has, for more than a century past, stood in the minds of all sections of the people for all that is honest and just; for freedom of thought, religion and trade. The question now is, was there an adequate reason for this extraordinary outburst of feeling ? Before this question can be answered a few facts connected with the history of the navigation companies must be stated and I will now touch on these as briefly and clearly as possible. First, the importance of the question of the navigation should be clearly understood. There are, so far, no railways in Mesopotamia and the whole of the import and export trade of the country passes up and down the two great rivers. The cereals, the dates, the wool and the gallnuts of the country are borne to the Persian Gulf on these rivers and by them the country receives in exchange the products of Europe and India. No other routes are open. Until a few years ago the Lynch Company had practically its ow r n way on the river. It is true that the terms of their concession only allowed them tw r o steamers, but these were fine cargo carrying boats and were efficiently run. The only other boats were a few old, out-of-date craft owned by the Turkish Government and these were as badly equipped as they were inefficiently managed. The Lynch Company thus virtually enjoyed a monopoly and they not unnaturally made the most of it. The regular fi eight from Basrah to Baghdad, a four days’ voyage, was 40s. and this often rose as high as 80s. a ton. Valuable cargo destined for Baghdad was kept lying on the open wharfs in Basrah, protected only by tarpaulins, for many months at a time. When the cargo did reach Baghdad it was often damaged and heavy losses were caused by this and by the fact that seasonal markets were regularly lost. The river freights were paid cash in advance in London and complaints on the part of the unfortunate cargo owners in Baghdad were not of the slightest avail. Shippers by the Lynch Company were simply told that if they did not like the conditions they must take their cargo elsewhere, i £., to the Turkish steamers where they could only be sure of even worse treatment. It is not too much to say that the whole country groaned under these conditions. Trade was checked on every side and agriculture suffered most severely. Grain grown for export often paid in river freight from Baghdad to Basrah alone, a three days’ down stream voyage, 40s. a ton, say 12s. per quarter, equal to 50 per cent, of its cost in the markets of Baghdad and thus the money which should have been coming back to enrich the agriculturalists and the country generally was going into the pockets of the Lynch Company. So secure and comfortable was the position of this concern, drawing without an effort its large profits while the country and trade generally suffered, that not once during the eighteen years’ residence of the writer has the country been visited by one of the Directors of the Company. Like absentee Irish landlords the members of the family controlling the company lived in England, spending there the revenues drawn from the suffering trade of the country. Under the old Hamidian regime no redress was possible. The large profits of the Turkish steamers were going into the hands of the Directors of the navyat Constantinople. Their interest was to take every penny of profit they could get from the steamers and they would neither spend a piastre of their ill-gotten gains on the improvement of the fleet nor would they allow others to come into the field. To increase the fleet would have meant parting with present spoil, possibly for the benefit of others, and to allow others to run steamers wouid have been, from their point of view, sheer madness. A few years ago, however, the death of the powerful head of the ring gave the Sultan, Abdul Hamid, his opportunity. He resolved to annex these profits for his private purse. As Sultan and the head of the Government, he sold to himself, Abdul Hamid, the entire fleet, steamers, barges, wharfs, offices, etc., for a mere song and put the whole concern under the management of the department which administered his private estates in Mesopotamia. We are not here concerned with the political morality of this act, the important fact is that it brought immediate relief to the trade of the country. The “ Seneea,” as the Sultan’s personal estate administration was called, was by far the most enlight ened and progressive administration in Mesopotamia. With plenty of funds at its disposal a progressive policy was adopted, four large new steamers were ordered in England and Belgium, the old boats were put into proper repair, new barges were built, and a policy, entirely new in the history of the river navigation, of encouragement to trade and agriculture, was adopted. This great improvement in the Turkish Company, which w r as then named the Hamidieh Administration, forced the British Company to follow in the same lines. Freights, both up and down river, were greatly reduced,—at the time of writing the upward freight is 25s. and the downward only 5s. 6d. per ton—the block of cargo in Basrah has entirely disappeared, goods being received in Baghdad in reasonable time after despatch from Europe or elsewhere. The river companies have fallen into their natural and proper position as servants of the public, not their masters, and while possibly their profits have declined, trade has flourished, the burden of a most objectionable monoply has been lifted from the country’s back and the way has been cleared for a great advance in trade and agriculture. Now I think the question as to whether there was an adequate reason for the recent outburst of feeling against the amalgamation can be answered. It was generally believed that the real aim of the scheme was the re-establishment of the most pernicious monopoly which existed a few years ago, a monopoly which for many years literally drew the life-blood out of the country and from which it has only in some measure been delivered in the last few years of the reign of Abdul Hamid. Is this, it was asked, going to be the first real act of the new regime, the restoration of a hateful monopoly under which we have groaned for many years ? In the old days we looked to England to protect us against oppression, how comes it that she is on the side of injustice now ? These very words were used in my presence by a respectable old Mahommedan and they may be said to be representative of the moderate, sound feeling in the country. It is really to us independent Britishers most astonishing and regrettabl® that our Government should have been led to support a scheme so distasteful to the whole country. A most objectionable feature of the amalgamation also is the fact that the members of the family which control the Lynch Company are the sole partners in the firms which hold and probably would continue to hold the steamer agencies m Baghdad and Basrah. These are trading concerns and preferential terms of freight given to them under the monopoly conditions wordd lead also to the establishment of a most objectionable commercial monopoly as no one could compete against a firm which held the controlling interest in the nnlv existing trade channel. We (I voice here the opinion of the countovl are told however, that there are guarantees for the protection of the public and that the new company is going to perform public services by improving navigation on the rivers, opening up the Tigris between Moosul and Baghdad clearing the channel of the Euphrates, etc. Now, no one knows exactly what the Guarantees are, but we do know Turkey and we profoundly distrust guarantees gken by a company which is going to have a Turkish constitution, to the Turkish Govern ment. Even supposing that the guarantees are most carefully framed what is to prevent their being swept away by a vote in Parliament engineered as the monopoly arrangement was engineered.

It will be a great misfortune if British Capitalists allow the chance of engineering this scheme to escape them.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 29 of the 20th and your despatch No/55 of the 28th ultimo, on the subject of the Lynch question, I have the honour to forward to you herewith the despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad to which reference is therein made, and which only reached me this morning. I have the honour to call your attention, firstly, to Mr. Lorimer’s remarks upon the standing and behaviour of Mr. Cree whose letter, which is enclosed in this despatch, contains the protest against the proposed fusion of the Lynch and Nahrieh steamers into one company enjoying a monopoly of the navigation of the river, and secondly, to the grounds of the protest itself. It is perhaps to be regretted that Mr. Cree has addressed himself to the press though it must be admitted that his conduct in not doing so until the question had passed out of its most acute phase was very correct. His remarks are worded with moderation and they appear to me to contain so large a measure of just comment as to be worthy of serious consideration. It is undeniable that at present the river is the only highway in Mesopotamia and as Mr. Lorimer does not controvert the statement, it must be presumed that Mr. Cree is correct in writing that, owing to the competition of the Nahrieh boats, the freight from Bussorah to Bagdad has sunk from between 60s. and 40s. per ton to 25s. Complaints of the careless handling of goods on the river boats are perennial and may be found 'passim in the despatches of Mr. Lorimer’s predecessor. It would appear further that the denunciations against the proposed fusion were of a very genuine character and were in no way stage-managed. I took advantage of a recent opportunity to discuss the Lynch scheme with a member of the Chamber who has special opportunities of knowing the sentiments of its members, and he stated that there was no chance of the scheme, if submitted to Parliament, being passed, on account of its being a monopoly, and because the inhabi tants of the country were convinced that, with a monopoly, no good service of boats can be secured, I explained that the works which were to be carried out on the river by the Lynch company made it necessary that the latter should enjoy a monopoly, and that the disadvantages which might attend this were obviated by the maximuru tariff, but my interlocutor was of opinion that either the Government or the company should undertake the work, and in return should have the right of levying tolls. He said there were other companies ready to apply for the right to navigate the river without a monopoly ; he did not believe the Government would be strong enough to pass the concession without submitting it to the Chamber whatever promises they might have made, and he repeated that if it were submitted the Chamber would steadily refuse to pass it. In conclusion, I venture to draw your attention to the last paragraph of Mr. Cree’s letter in which he describes Mesopotamia as the hinterland of the Levant and dwells on the enormous advantages both for the country and for British enterprise which may be hoped for from the construction of a railway from the Mediterranean along the Euphrates to Bagdad.

Dear Mr. Lorimer, Bagdad, February 17, 1910. WHEN there was so much excitement here over the Lynch concession, I entirely abstained from joining in the agitation against it, though I was pressed by^ many native friends to take a part. I thought the spectacle of British merchants agitating against what were supposed to be British interests, strongly supported by our Govern ment, would be unedifying and undesirable.

I therefore feel that silence on the subject is no longer necessary or desirable. I have accordingly taken as my text a paragraph in “ Truth ” of the 22nd December last (which you have seen) and addressed a letter to the editor, which I think is a true and fair statement of the facts. It is a matter of indifference to me whether this letter is published or not, but my object in sending you a copy is a very serious one. I may say that my object is two-fold : First, it is to ask you, as the representative of His Majesty’s Government, to be so good as to take steps to protect us, as independent British merchants, against the possible operations of this monopoly. We have now been at work for many years in this country, we have had to struggle against every kind of difficulty, and we have never asked for any kind of special assistance from our Government. We have, however, done our best to promote British trade, and we now beg that our Government will protect us and see that we have a fair field for our humble operations. My second object is one which would, were we m England, be fittingly expressed in a letter to the public press. It is to express the very humble and respectful but at the same time convinced opinion that if this monopoly scheme goes through our Government will, rightly or wrongly, for many years to come be associated in the minds of the people of Mesopotamia with an act of grave injustice. Yours faithfully, T. D. CBEE.4 of feeling ? Before this question can be answered a few facts connected with the history of the navigation companies must he stated and I will now touch on these as clearly^andtarfy MpossjUe-the of the nav iga t ion should be clearly under stood There are so far no railways in Mesopotamia and the whole of the import and export trade of the country passes up and down the two great rivers.

We (I voice here the opinion of the country) are told, however, that there are guarantees for the protection of the^ public^ and that the new company is going to perform public services by improving navigation on the rivers, opening up the Tigris between Mosul and Bagdad, clearing the channel of the Euphrates, &amp;c. Now no one knows exactly what the guarantees are, but we do know Turkey, and we profoundly distrust guarantees given by a company which is going to have a Turkish constitution to the Turkish Government. Even supposing that the guarantees are most carefully framed, what is to prevent their being swept away by a vote in Parliament engineered as the monopoly arrangement was engineered. Again, if the rivers want opening up, this is a public work, and should be performed by the Turkish Government, which has now the means to perform such useful works. We want, however, no guarantees of any nature, good or bad; all that we want is common justice, the right to freely navigate our own rivers, the right to live free from the burden of a hateful monopoly. This is the cry of the people of Mesopotamia, and is it too late to hope that our Government will hear this appeal and refuse to range itself on the side of the monopoly-mongers ? I do not expect you to publish this, but I think it only right that you should be informed of the true facts in case the subject should come again into public view. The crying need of this country, as Sir William Willcocks has pointed out, is a direct railway to the Mediterranean. The German railway, coming down by Diarbekir and Mosul, is no use to us. This country is really the “ hinterland ” of the Levant, and the day a railway from some port of the Mediterranean coast touches the Euphrates will see the dawn of a new era of prosperity for the land. There is a tremendous commercial future for this railway: comparatively short, built over level plains at a minimum expense, it will have the handling of the immense crops which will be grown in Mesopotamia as soon as Sir William Willcocks’s irrigation scheme begins to bear fruit. It will carry into the country in exchange the products of Europe, and will, by the cheapening of freight charges, enable British goods to compete with Bussian, even on the shores of the Caspian. Instead of Bagdad being a place at the end of a long and painful voyage through the Suez Canal, along the unlighted, dangerous, and barren and burning coasts of the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf, and then up a tortuous and difficult river, it will be a place distant some fifteen hours from the Mediterranean. It will be a great misfortune if British capitalists allow the chance of engineering this scheme to escape them. It is essentially a British scheme, the idea being really the rebirth of the old British Euphrates Valley Railway concession, but under entirely new conditions and with a certainty of success far beyond the most sanguine dreams of the original promoters.J T M^ DQCnmen t Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

A [8290] No. 1. +()0l' L { ,, ~) Mr. Lynch to Foreign Office.—(Received March 9.) ^ ir ’ w-ptct r i ^ Pont Street, S.W., March 8, 1910. , TT re - re 1 nce io , 7 0u r letter of the 28tli ultimo, I understand therefrom that thejUrand Vizier bases his refusal to conclude the convention for the fusion of the two companies on two grounds. Firstly, on the ground that our proposal to provide compensation out of the resources o*f the new company would involve the Turkish ireasury in a hnancial engagement, and that no scheme for providing compensation can be devised which would not involve the Treasury indirectly ; and, secondly, on the ground that the parliamentary vote of 13th December last precluded him from concluding the affair until the powers of the executive have clearly been laid down. As regards the first of these objections, I have taken high legal advice as to t 1 r 16r cou ^ properly be maintained that our proposal for a compensation fund out of the resources of the company involves an obligation upon the Turkish budget—you wul remember that the resolution passed by Parliament had reference to the budget. Ihe answer which I have received is in the negative. Our proposal involves no charge upon the budget; and it is this which Hilmi Pasha, in his speech in the Chamber, undertook to prevent. Apart from the legal aspect of the question, it would, I submit, be straining the terms of the parliamentary resolution very far to make them bear this construction; and it would be straining them to breaking-point if they were held to include any indirect effects upon the Treasury. In that case the convention could not be executed at all, quite apart from the compensation fund ; for it contains several other provisions which might be regarded as indirectly affecting the Turkish Treasury, such as immunity from customs duties and the obvious liability upon the shares subscribed for. It was urged by the Turkish Parliament that it is usual in constitutional countries that schemes of a similar nature to this scheme should come before Parliament; but if a Parliament, so jealous of the control of finance as the British Parliament, in sanctioning the purchase of the Suez Canal Shares, had sought to impose a condition that without its sanction the Suez Canal Company should not do anything which might indirectly affect the British budget, the shares would not have been acquired. Such a condition would have prevented the company lowering its dues on vessels without this sanction, as it might reduce the dividends payable upon the British Government’s shares, and so compel the Government to raise additional money by some budget. Clearly, what the Ottoman Chamber wished to prohibit was the granting by the Government of concessions imposing any liability by-way of guarantee or otherwise to pay money out of the Ottoman revenue. Under our proposal the compensation fund would be provided, not by the budget, but from the company’s earnings. For these reasons, I cannot help feeling that the Grand Vizier has placed an interpretation upon the resolution of Parliament which w^as not contemplated by its authors. The second objection of the Grand Vizier, that he is precluded from concluding the affair until the powers of the executive in such a matter have clearly been laid down, wmuld appear to be equally without foundation. The resolution, the text of which I recited in my letter of the 16th ultimo, expressly excepted our convention, which was very f ally discussed during two whole sittings, from other concessions, and it expressly authorised the executive to conclude it. That there was no doubt whatever at the time as to the meaning of the resolution in this respect is shown by the statement made to Colonel Picot by the Minister of Finance just before Colonel Picot left Constantinople, to the effect that, even if the new law should be passed by Parliament before the question of compensation had been settled between the Cabinet and ourselves, this would in no wise preclude the power of the Cabinet to exercise its right to deal ■with the matter without further reference to Parliament, as they would be covered by the resolution. Javid Bey repudiated with warmth Colonel Picot’s suggestion that the new law might be made a pretext for the transference of the convention by the Cabinet to Parliament. [2679 i 3] | COPY TO P . d]C?.. y c p o' /SI trust that the foregoing statements of the Grand Vizier were not received without protest by His Majesty’s Ambassador,_ who would, no doubt, be able to expose the fallacies which in our opinion, underlie them, better than I have been able to present them. I also trust that His Majesty’s Ambassador may see his way to make it clear to the Turkish Government that this must remain a Cabinet question. Our representative in Constantinople informs me that the Council of Ministers refuse even to discuss the question of compensation before the new law has passed. I can find no justification whatever for this course in the resolution of Parliament. In the meantime I have received a letter from the Bagdad agent of the British I Company, reporting that rumours are current in Bagdad that a German group have made offers to take over the Turkish steamers. He adds that, while not attaching undue weight to these rumours, he would not be surprised if the report of the German offer should turn out to have been founded on fact, I have, &amp;c. H. F. B.

Memorandum by Consul-General Lorimer respecting the “ Affaire Lynch ” in Irak (December 1909 and January 1910j. Course of Events .—The disposal of the Nahriyah steamers, those, namely, plying between Bagdad and Bussorah, which were till lately the property of the Hamidieh Administration, and now belong to the Turkish Government, was not much discussed up to the time I left Bagdad on tour on the 14th December, 1909. But, even before that, articles had begun to appear in the Bagdad and Bussorah press, urging Turkish subjects to purchase the steamers from the Government, which was desirous of selling them, and to resist the grant of any navigation concession to foreigners, and in particular to the British firm of Lynch, who were understood to have made an offer for the whole Nahriyah fleet. December 14.—About the 14th December a number of merchants, Christians and Jews as well as Mahommedans, protested by telegram to Constantinople against the supposed intention of the Chamber of Deputies to sanction a concession for navigation in favour of Messrs. Lynch, and to sell them the Nahrijah steamers. The merchants also B 1 O... | S£Of S B 1 / v B'/' [2679 e—3] COPY 10 if /2 sent a W memorandum to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, reciting the following arguments against what they had heard was proposed : 1 Freight and fares between Bagdad and Bussorah would probably be increased, as there would no longer be any competition. • -&gt; x i , • j \ 2 The working of the steamers might be manipulated so as to give an advantag (1 ) to British over other trade. , ^ i i i. m j 3. In case of tribal disturbances upon the river the firm would probably demand compensation for the interruption of their business, which they could not do so long as there were also Turkish steamers on the river. opportunity would be created, in case of tribal distui bances, tor political interference by the British Government. . 5. The Turkish Government would no longer have any steamers at its disposal for the transport of troops, in case of tribal disturbances. 6. The transfer of the steamers would have a bad political efiect upon the rebellious tribes, and the steamers might even be used by the British in such a way as to assist and encourage those tribes. India was an excellent instance of how political designs might be pushed under cover of trade. 7. The same price could be obtained from themselves (the merchants) as from Messrs. Lynch, and they would agree to conditions more favourable to the Turkish Government. December 15.—On the 15th December the Bagdad branch of the Committee of Union and Progress held a meeting at the First Military Club, and a resolution was passed to the effect that the grant of a navigation concession to foreigners would be very injurious to the interests of Turkey. The committee appointed a deputation consisting of Abdul Jabbar Khaiyatzadah (a Christian lawyer), Manahirn Salih (a Jewish lawyer), Yahuda Zaluf (a Jewish merchant), Wafik Bey (a Turk, mudir of the local custom-house), and Yusuf Shantub (a Jewish merchant), to interview the vali and protest against the concession in the name of “ the mercantile community and the other inhabitants of Bagdad.” I do not know what was done by the members of this deputation. December 18.—On the 18th December the secretary (“Maktubji ”) to the Bagdad Government received a telegram from Mustafa Nur-ud-Din (deputy for the Diwaniyah sanjak) at Constantinople, in which the sender stated that he had failed to dissuade the Chamber from granting the proposed concession. It was also stated about this time that Sasun (a Jew, and one of the deputies for Bagdad city) had presented the Chamber with a memorandum against the concession. December IQ. —On or about the L9th December the secretary to the Bagdad Govern ment received a second telegram from the deputy, Mustafa Nur-ud-Din, informing him that the Chamber, notwithstanding the united opposition of the deputies for Bagdad, Bussorah, Musal, and Dair-az-Zor, had decided by a majority of votes to approve the concession. Two Bagdad deputies (Sasun and Isma’il Hakki) also sent a telegram to the president of the Bagdad municipality which was not altogether intelligible, but seemed to imply that the matter of the concession was not yet finally decided in consequence of some difficulty about a financial guarantee. On this day the excitement at Bagdad greatly increased ; and the telegraph-office was soon crowded with people, chiefly merchants, wishing to send messages to Govern ment about the concession. Ordinary telegraphic business had to be suspended. The crowd demanded that the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior at Constantinople should come to the telegraph-office there, and discuss matters with them direct. It is understood that the two Ministers complied to the extent of coming to the office and sending reassuring messages of a general character. The correspondence was apparently interrupted by a failure of the wire between Bagdad and Diarbekir, in which the crowd were at the time not disposed to believe, but which was afterwards proved to have taken place. The interruption lasted eight hours. December 20.—On the 20th December a wire was sent by someone at Bagdad to the Deputies Sasun and Isma’il Hakki, requesting them to explain their obscure telegram of the 19th, to afiord all the information tnat they possessed, and to continue opposing the concession. Another telegram was despatched to the Prime Minister and other members of the Turkish Cabinet, to the presidents of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, to the deputies for Bagdad, Bussorah, Musal, Dair-az-Zor, Hedjaz, and Yaman, to Nazim Pasha (the vali-elect of Bagdad^ and to the editors of a number of newspapers at Constantinople. It stated that the life of Irak depended on the rivers Tigris andtelegrams was probably Abdul Kadir Pasha Euphrates, and that to give a concession for their navigation to foreigners would be to and other measures taken. deputies would be recalled from Constantinople The actual sender of these Y‘ Khadhairi”), a merchant. Ttiorhul citv ( ^ a ?i a Irlas ^ r ' 1( ^tiog was held on the plain outside the north gate of Bagdad city It was I believe organised by Abdul Kadir Pasha (“Khadhairi”) i iedLTot 1011 + T d Ma ^ mud (“Shabandar”) another merchant. The meeting ! n noo TKe ’ d 16 r '‘' l '' r P eo P le taking part in it was estimated at 5,000 to 10,000. the arrangements made by the vali for the maintenance of order were excellent and prevented the possibility of any disturbance. A speech was delivered in Turkish by Abdul Majid Pal at, editor of the Turkish newspaper “ A1 Hakikah,” and another in Arabic by Kadhim (“ Dijaili ”), a clerk in the Military Department. The first of these speeches was not generally understood, being in Turkish, but the second produced a great effect and moved many to tears. The organisers, with the assumed consent of the meeting then nominated a committee of about fifty members (Mohammedans, Jews and Christians) to watch the interests of the inhabitants of Bagdad in the matter of the concession. The committee thus appointed included the khadhairi and the shabandar themselves, a number of Government officials and ex-officials, a number of merchants (mostly Jewish and Christian), the editors of one Ghnstian and five Mohammedan newspapers, and one Mohammedan schoolmaster, from the shortness of my experience here I am unable to estimate the representative character or otherwise of the committee ; moreover it does not appear that the persons nominated as members were present or had been previously consulted ; and I hear that one Christian whose name was used in connection with the movement subsequentlv denied being in sympathy with it. After the meeting the khadhairi sent telegrams in the name of the people of Bagdad to the people of Bussorah, Musal and Dair-az-Zor, urging them to co-operate in opposing the concession “for the sake of our fatherland.” Rumours began to be circulated among the common people that Irak had been sold to the Biitish, that native ladies would be compelled to unveil, that male Mohammedans would be obliged to wear hats, &amp;c. The first dragoman of this Consulate-General reported that, in view of the prevalent excitement, British subjects would be well- advised to behave with circumspection. A sensible telegram was next received from Nazim Pasha, vali-elect of Bagdad, in reply to that sent him, asking the people to keep quiet and have contidence in the Government. A second telegram was then sent to Nazim Pasha by the agitators, informing him that a mass meeting of 30,000 persons at Bagdad had condemned the proposed concession. Still, on the 20th December a number of persons, probably some of those nominated as a committee at the mass meeting, waited on the vali and asked him to go with them to the telegraph office. The vali went, and wired officially to the Prime Minister that there was great popular excitement, and that the demands of the people should be conceded. 1 am informed that Mohammed Shaukat Pasha was personally in sympathy with the objects, though not with the methods, of the agitators, also that he was a good deal confused and alarmed by the storm which had so suddenly arisen. December 21.—On the 21st December the vali of Bagdad received a telegram from the Prime Minister at Constantinople, apparently to the following effect :—- The decision arrived at by the Cabinet had been approved by the Chamber of Deputies, after three or four days’ discussion, only eight deputies dissenting. It was the Cabinet and Parliament who were responsible to the nation. Misunderstandings had been created at Constantinople and Bagdad by mischief-makers. What had been arranged—as the Minister of the Interior would presently inform the vali—was not a sale of the Nahriyah steamers to Messrs. Lynch, but the formation of an Ottoman company, including Messrs. Lynch, on the directorate, of which there would be four Ottoman subjects. Respectable Bagdad merchants would naturally, on account of their local knowledge, be eligible persons as directors. “If it were secured that the shares should not come into foreign hands, it would be possible to sell some of them at Bagdad, and there would be no harm to the country from this arrangement, which was still under consideration.” These facts should be explained to the people, who had collected at the telegraph office, and they should be told to trust the Government to look after the interests of the country.” msssssrnms:4 The Minister of the Interior’s telegram was similar to the above, but it gave the following additional particulais : “ Th p arrangements contemplated would be for a period of tbirty-seven years only in the first instance. Ottoman troops would be carried by the steamers, whenever necessary, at one-fourth the rates fixed for ordinary passengers. Private individual ^ would not be precluded from owning and running steamers m the service of their own trade. The irrigation schemes of the Government would not be hampered in any way by the navigation agreement. One essential condition (not described.) still remained under discussion. The people should remain quiet and have confidence in the Govern ment.” Another telegram from the deputies, Sasun and Isma il Hakki, apparently in elucidation of their unintelligible wire of the 19th, now came in. It stated that there was friction between the Cabinet and the Chamber, that the concession was not yet finally settled, and that Messrs. Lynch were stipulating for compensation in case navigation should be prejudiced by irrigation works, but that^ the Cabinet had refused to aoree to this last suggestion, and had proposed an alternative arrangement. °The vali replied the same day to the Minister of the Interior, reporting (appa rently without comment) the following remarks of ‘‘the Turkish merchants of P&gt;agdad ” ;— 1. The concession should not involve any kind of monopoly. 2. If the steamers must be sold, the Turkish merchants themselves would buy them on anv reasonable conditions. 3. A company, if formed, should consist of Turkish subjects only, and should be bound to comply with all reasonable requirements of the Government. Messrs. Lynch should retain their present two steamers. 4. The arrangements explained in the Minister’s telegram to the vali would be most harmful, and they were not acquiesced in by the people. 5. The people would accept any proposals by the Government which did not involve the intrusion of foreigners. Also on the 21st December a telegram was dispatched from Bussorah by twenty- seven private individuals protesting against a concession to foreigners. The Musal branch of the Committee of Union and Progress also informed the Bagdad branch on this day that they had sent a strong protest to Constantinople against the concession. The action taken at Bussorah and Musal is no doubt to be attributed to the wire pulling of the Bagdad agitators. December 22.—On the 22nd December the khadhairi, the shabandar, and their chief associates were still practically inhabiting the telegraph office, but ordinary telegrams were again being accepted for transmission. It was now the talk of the Bagdad cafes that three members of the Turkish Cabinet had accepted a bribe of £ T. 50,000 from Messrs. Lynch (!) At Kadhimain, a Shi’ah town 3 miles from Bagdad, there was a great stir on this date. Inflammatory harangues were delivered urging the people not to let the sacred land of Ah and Husain be “sold” to unbelievers, and matters reached such a pass that the shopkeepers in the bazaar closed their shops. Here a number of the demonstrators were probably not even Turkish subjects, but Persians. The vali of Bagdad also received a cypher telegram from the Prime Minister (contents unknown), and apparently informed the merchants that its tenour was favourable. A cypher telegram was now sent by the vali of Bussorah to Constantinople stating that the sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit had heard of the intended sale of the Turkish steamers and probable grant of a monopoly for the navigation of “ both rivers” to Messrs. Lynch. This disposed the sheikhs to think that the Turks would in future be powerless, and they evidently expected that Messrs. Lynch would promote their (the sheikhs ) interests. I he vah had also heard that a large scheme for the occupa tion of Bussorah was being prepared (? by the British Government) ; but be could extinguish all these mischievous ideas if he weie only authorised to announce that no concession would be given to foreigners. (This silly telegram seems to show that the vali of Bussorah, who is new to the place, must have lost his head for the time being.) December 23.—[Nib] December 24.—On the 24th December I returned to Bagdad from tour. Captain AMcPherson, the icsidency surgeon, had a somewhat anxious time until my arrival, but he behaved throughout with commendable composure. Decembev 25.—On the afternoon of the 25th December the vali of Bagdad received a cypher telegram authorising him, at least so it was stated, to proclaim partial law at Bagdad in case of a riot. This news (whether true or false) had a most sedative effect when it became generally known. the procureur-general, nevertheless, sent an alarmist wire from Bagdad to the Minister of Justice at Constantinople, hut it seems to have been disregarded. The khadhairi also, who felt that matters had begun to go against him, asked the president of the benate by telegram to converse with him (“ as representative of the people ”) over the wires ; but the president excused himself. The khadhairi and the shabandar then wired to the Prime Minister and others in somewhat violent language, accusing Messrs. Lynch of having in the past supplied the Arab tribes with modern rifles. December 26.—There had been some talk, before this, of demonstrations by mobs against the British residency, and the premises of Messrs. Lynch at Bagdad ; but I had abstained from communicating with the vali, as I did not consider that there was any real danger. On the 26th December the gendarmerie and police guards at the police- posts nearest to the points supposed to be threatened were reinforced. At Bas-al-Karaiyah, near Messrs. Lynch’s office, the guard was increased to 3 officers and 20 men ; at Murabba’, near the residency, to 5 officers and 27 men; and at Sanak, not far from the private house of Messrs. Lynch’s English agent, to 2 officers and 18 men. Ordinarily there are not more than 1 officer and 11 men at each of these posts. Mohammed Shaukat Pasha may, 1 think, be relied on to act with energy and discretion in matters which are of a military or semi-military nature. On the night of the 26th (27th) December Sheikh Ibrahim (“ Khurasani ”) of Kadhimain, Mujtahid, a ringleader in the disturbance which took place there on the 22nd, died suddenly at his own house from natural causes. December 27.-—On the 27th December one of the Irak deputies at Constantinople wired on behalf of himself and his colleagues, “ to our countrymen, care of the Bagdad Municipality,” saying that the matter of the concession was still undecided, that the local deputies were using their best efforts, and that the people should be careful to act with moderation, i his was a new note in the correspondence of the local deputies with their constituents. There was still a good deal of latent excitement at Bagdad ; and on this day, deceived by the shouts of a body of pilgrims, a rabble collected in the suburb on the right bank of the river under the impression that a riot and looting were about to commence on the left bank. The police, however, prevented them from crossing the bridge of boats. About this time I was made somewhat uneasy by indications of a tendency for popular feeling to turn against Sir William Willcocks’ schemes, which by many are regarded as a British rather than a Turkish concern. That this should have been so w^as not unnatural, for the dangerously foreign character of Sir William’s enterprise had been insisted on by the agitators during the agitation. The Nakid of Bagdad, however, who is pecuniarily interested m the irrigation of the country, and who in a quiet way seems well-disposed towards things British, took up the line that irrigation and navigation are incompatible, and that there can therefore be no collusion between Sir W. Willcocks and Messrs. Lynch. He has also been endeavouring to impress upon excited patriots the view that the abolition of Messrs. Lynch s perpetual^ concession will be advantageously purchased at the expense even of a thirty-seven ) ears monopoly. (This argument seems to involve an unwarranted assumption). I do not think that the irrigation projects will be discredited here by what has been said against them. December 28 to 31.—[Nil.] . . „ . „ . . January 1.—On the 1st January, 1910, the resignation of the Prime Minister became known at Bagdad, where it was attributed to the policy pursued by him m the matter of the concession. January 2 to 20.—[Nik] . 1v/r . . , January 21.—On the 21st January, after the formation of the new Ministry the vali of Bagdad received a telegram from the Prime Minister asking what sum the local merchants interested in river navigation would deposit, if required, m the Bagdad branc of the Ottoman Bank. . . . ... u 11 January 23 —On the 23rd January some eleven of the principal agitators held a meeting at the house of Abdur Rahman Pasha (“ Haidari ”) to deliberate on this commum- [2679 y—3] C6 cation. They apparently found themselves unable to arrive at “ any practical conclusion,” January 25,—A telegram of the 25th January from the “ Agence ottomane ” at Constantinople to the “ Mesopotamie,” newspaper at Bagdad contained these words “ Le programme ministeriel ne fait aucune allusion a la question Lynch. L v ij parlement et le public ne sen occupent guere. Dans^la presse, silence complet. Nous nouvons affirmer que la concession ne sera pas donnee a Lynch. January 26,—On the 26th January the vali of Bagdad replied to the Prime Minister’s telegram of the 23rd, saying that no Bagdad merchants had come forward as applicants (quenj) for shares in a Turkish river navigation company. Observations. —I believe that the agitation here was only rendered possible by the fear which seized all business men at Bagdad (including Euiopean merchants) on hearing that some sort of monopoly for the navigation of the Tigris was likely to be granted, and that Messrs. Lynch, who themselves do a trade _ here besides owning steamers, would probably be participants in it. I do not think that this purely commercial anxiety is even yet allayed; for it is said that, though maximum rates of freight may be fixed, these can never be so low as would have been obtained by free competition. The merchants generally, including Oriental Christians and Jews, were at first inclined to throw in their lot with the agitation; but, as the language of the agitators grew more and more extreme, they separated themselves from it. By the end of December the agitators had the field left to themselves and the permanent following, almost entirely Mahommedans which they had succeeded in attaching to themselves. I am under the impression that this following is not now, to any great extent, of a com mercial character. I do not know what the real motives of the agitators were. The khadhairi and the shabandar are themselves merchants ; and the former, I am fold, has a strong personal dislike for Messrs. Lynch’s principal representative here. Sasun, the Bagdad deputy at Constantinople, was once director ol the Hamidieh Administration which originally owned the steamers. Whatever the objects of the agitators, their manner of proceeding was highly reprehensible. If the action of the Central Government and the local executive had been less firm, they might eventually have succeeded in provoking riots. J. G. LO RIMER, Officiating Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, and His Britannic Majesty s Consul-General, Bagdad. Bagdad, January 31, 1010. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Confidential Memorandum by “A. R. BA ON the 12th January I went to see the Nakib’s family, and at Pir ’Abdus-Salam’s house I met the following members of it : Seyyid Ibrahim,'the Pir' :;: ' of the Memoirs of Kurrachee and Bombay, a cousin of the Nakib, and a man of vast influence ; Seyyid Hashim, son of the Nakib ; Seyyid Majid Effendi, nephew of the Nakib ; and Pir ’Abdus-Salom, brother of the Nakib. They happened to be talking about the sale of the Turkish steamers to Lynch and Co. when I entered. After the usual greetings Seyyids Ibrahim and Hashim asked me whether it was true that the British Minister for Foreign Affairs had intimated to the “ Nazir Kharijiyah ” in plain words that, if the steamers in question weie not given to Lynch and Co., the Butish Government would be obhsred to withdraw its countenance from the Porte and drop friendly relations. .1 replied that I was not aware of it, and that I did not consider it to be possible. They did not believe this and told me that it was stated all over the town, and that the lurkish ofhcial circle here believed the statement to be correct They only wondered, they said, why the British Government should make a political grievance of the matter, especially at a time when the success of Sir William Willcocks’ irrigation and railway schemes depended on a good understanding between the two Governments. Moreover, it was evident that Mahommedans, Christians, and Jews could never * Religious preceptor.7 * co-operate with each other and therefore could not take over the steamers; for the Mahommedans were incapable and impecunious, and the Christians were in sympathy with Lynch and with the British Government; and the Jews, while they possessed capital, lacked enteipuse, and were not certain of the present regime or consequently the investment being a^safe one. In official circles here the patriotism of the Jews vas doubted, and the Jewish community were suspected of leanings towards the British Government, because the major portion of their trade was with India and England. The proceedings of certain wealthy Jews were considered nothing but a sham.* The Turkish officials believed that the Christians and Jews would have joined Lynch and Co. long ago had^ it not been, for the fact that the company keep its accounts secret, and announces dividends at whatever rate it pleases. My friends again said that they could not understand the attitude of the British Government in this affair, nor why it should take up the cudgels on behalf of Lynch and Co. I he threats of the British foreign Minister and the insistence of the British Ambassador upon the vague promises made by Hilmi Pasha and some members of the Cabinet were simply incomprehensible. I replied : ‘ I am not in the confidence of the Government, but my common sense tells me that Lynch and Co. is a purely private concern, and has nothing to do with politics, and, therefore, it is not possible for me to believe that the British Foreign Minister would use threats on its behalf. In the beginning of the conversation you made certain insinuations against the British Government which, I think, are totally unfounded. As far as I know the British Government has no designs on Mesopotamia.’ 7 To turn the whole matter into a joke, I recited Hafiz 7 verse :— “ Kings know best the policies and secrets of their States: You are a lonely recluse, Hafiz, therefore keep silence.” They all laughed, and Seyyid Hashim remarked: “A good Government produces good servants who keep their tongues discreetly in their mouths, unlike our Govern ment, whose officials, from the highest to the lowest, are corrupt, ignorant, and uneducated.” As if to illustrate this remark, Pir Ibrahim said that a Turkish engineer, if there were such a thing, would be the last person in the world to know anything of politics. “ But look at Sir William Willcocks,” he added, “ all whose proceedings from beginning to end are those of an astute politician. Even British military men, whose trade is lighting only, know as much about politics as the civilians themselves.” In reply, I said : “ If you mean this as a compliment I am grateful; and I am sure that, if Sir William Willcocks were here, he would also be grateful; but, if you mean anything more, I must assure you that you are wrong.” Pir Ibrahim laughed and said : “We know better. It is the same old story. The drama of Egypt shall be re-enacted in Irak. First comes the irrigation scheme, which entails the services of 25,000 coolies and agriculturists from India. Then, all of a sudden, it is discovered that it will be no good to make the soil productive unless there are means of exporting the superabundant produce to profitable markets. To achieve this purpose railways must be established. This means more Indians, say, 10,000 to 15,000, as railway employes, &amp;c. Then there is the question of money, for the Turkish Government is insolvent. Sir William Willcocks obtains permission to raise a loan in England. Either the British Government or the British people find the money. The loan is raised ; irrigation and railway schemes are completed. New schemes crop up and the loan is never repaid. A foolish Arab tribe makes a raid upon the Indian colony. Military intervention becomes imperative; India is near, and occupation follows and Mesopotamia becomes Egypt. 7 Here a young Nakibzadah remarked : “ So much the better. With abuse of the Turkish officials he went on to say : “ An embankment of ours^ (the name escaped me) t£ burst three days ago, and if not attended to at once will require 1,500 bias loi repairs^ apart from the damage which it will cause.

Irrigation of Mesopotamia became a necessity with the Turks, and who more fitted to undertake this gigantic task than the celebrated^ &gt; Sir William Willcocks of Egyptian fame? He took up the task at the request of the Turkish Government. The Porte are not children that they should be frightened or wheedled into appointing Sir William Willcocks. Now, if Sir William proposes the employment of Indians on these works, is it to be wondered at ? Who are more expert than Indians in doing this sort of work, or who could do it on such low wages ? _ It would be strictly in accordance with prudence and economy. Economy^ is a thing unknown in your country, otherwise you would not be surprised at Sir William proposing a railway. Of what use would the pioduce be to the Government, 01 to the people themselves, unless it could fetch a good price ? The present pioduce suffices for the wants of the people. What is the good then of spending enormous sums on raising more crops, unless they are to be exported to foreign countries and bring m money and add to the wealth of the country? And this cannot be done without improved means of communication such as railways, &amp;c. Now can you honestly say that you still detect dishonest or political designs in the scheme?

As far as I know, the British Government only tries to keep away foreigners from the Persian Gulf, where it has spent much in money and men during_more than a century. The Turks would do better to cultivate the friendship of the British Govern ment, since King Edward rules over more Mohammedans than even the Sultan of Turkey does, and this should be a link which should join the two Governments more closely and firmly, because their interests demand it. # At this time more visitors came in, and we dropped the discussion, and soon after I took my leave. Note by “A. E. B.” I believe that the opinions expressed by the Nakibzadahs are not solely their own. Three of the family are members of the Courts in the Sarai. Moreover, Turkish otficials constantly come to them and talk on these subjects. I think their opinions probably reflect the official view here, with additions and modifications. The Nakib’s family take a keen interest in politics, and most of them are well-informed and well-read. Each of them can talk several languages, and consequently the extent of their know ledge and the sources of their information are much wider than those of ordinary Turks. o * This would have been better left unsaid, and I have told my informant so, but no harm has been done.ASIATIC TURKEY A ND ARABIA.

WITH reference to a letter from onr Bagdad agent, under date the 24th January, on the subject of irrigation scheme in Mesopotamia, a copy of which Colonel Picot left with Sir Charles Hardinge on the 21st ultimo, and a further copy of which I enclose, I am directed by my board to enquire whether His Majesty’s Government have any information which they could communicate to our board as to the scope of the schemes which, we understand, have been laid before the Turkish Government by Sir William Willcocks, and as to their probable effect upon navigation should they be placed in execution. . . -d j i ^ , We understand from this communication from our Bagdad agent, and irom previous communications from the same source, as well as from other sources, that, in addition to the project referred to in the enclosed letter, another project, or other projects have been submitted by Sir William Willcocks which would conserve the rivers for purposes of navigation. Indeed, Sir William informed our Bagdad agent, prior to his recent visit to Constantinople, that his schemes, far froin diminishing the water in the rivers, would actually render them better suited for navigation than they are at present. All the information therefore in our possession points to the conclusion that two schemes have been, and may still be, under consideration : the one preserving, and possibly improving the navigation, and the other tending to destroy it. The former plan would seem to be the plan first favoured by Sir William Willcocks, though it mav be the more expensive plan. o + In view of the great importance to British interests of the maintenance of water communication between the Persian Gulf and the interior of Mesopotamia, and of the faet'that the transit trade with Persia travels so largely by this route, my board feel iustified in requesting information on the scope of these irrigation schemes, and m suggesting that His Majesty’s Ambassador m Constantinople, as well as our consul- Sral if Bagdad, may be asked to address any further enquiries which may seem desirable to the Turkish Government and to Sir William Willcocks.

Experts have expressed the opinion, after examination of the data collected by Sir William Willcocks, that more than a century of years would pass before the silt deposited will fill the depression forming the lake. v Such a canal would take most of the water out of the two rivers below Beled an&lt;i / Eomadi, and navigation would be impeded thereby, if not entirely stopped.

Lynch.—(Communicated to Foreign Office by Colonel Picot, February 21, 1910.) WHILE the question of the amalgamation of the river services on the Tigris was under discussion at Constantinople, the columns of the “ Osmanischer Lloyd,” the organ of the German Embassy in Constantinople, were filled with attacks upon the scheme. All the resources of German diplomacy in Constantinople were employed to excite Turkish suspicions, and the task was accomplished in so effectual a manner that its results have out-lived the comparative detente which has since taken place between British and German policy in Constantinople. The Germans recognised from the first that if the navigation of the great rivers of Mesopotamia were developed as a result of the carrying into execution of the amalgamation scheme, the Bagdad Railway in its passage to the Persian Gulf would have to compete with the well-organised service of steamers on the great rivers. Moreover, the steamers, operating from a base on the Persian Gulf, where British trade is still supreme, would prevent the diversion of the trade of Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean, which is one of the objects of German policy. For these reasons German diplomacy has worked persistently against the amalgamation scheme. Further light upon the question is thrown by a report which has just been received from the agents of the British River Company in Bagdad, a copy of which is appended hereto. From this it appears that the Turkish Government have been favouring a plan of irrigation the effect of which would be to destroy the navigation. Should the scheme for the amalgamation of the two river services fall through, the result cannot fail to be far-reaching, in a sense highly unfavourable to important British political and commercial interests. The communications of the country will pass out of our hands, and the trade will be diverted from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. The board of the Euphrates Company would be wanting in their duty to His Majesty’s Government were they to fail to point out the extreme gravity of the present situation, as well as the far-reaching nature of the consequences likely to ensue, should the amalgamation scheme be defeated. On the other hand, should the scheme go through, British interests, which are now the predominant foreign interests in Mesopotamia, would have to be consulted in any plans for the irrigation of the country; and water carriage under English auspices and based upon the Persian Gulf, would be given its full effect, as opposed to railway carriage under German auspices based upon the Mediterranean.

Dear SmGerar and oaU on you this morning, but no doubt you will have alreadv perused in the newspapers the articles on the proposed Law on Concessions. Clause'2 ofthis law would seem to be especially drawn up for and aimed at the Lyn Thflurkish company is to-day practically a public service, the receipts from which and the expenses of which are included in the budget. , , ,, , The Cabinet has shown its hand, and it is perfectly clear now that they have purposely delayed matters, because they intended that under the new law the sc erne should again be put before Parliament. &gt; i, j r i i It would have been better and more honest, it seems to me, if they had frankly told us that they intended drawing up the new law in such a way as to necessitate this, because they dare not pass the scheme themselves • ^ . • t&gt; r +. There is no doubt now that even before the famous interpellation m Parliament Government had made up its mind not to grant the concession, and have been playing with us ever since. „ . . . T , Whether Parliament will eventually approve of or reject the scheme, I cannot say but I fear that the whole modus operandi has been planned out with the object ot getting the scheme rejected by Parliament and freeing themselves thus trom any responsibility, which their official promises entailed. If the scheme is rejected, as Fitzmaurice said yesterday, it would be an extremely serious blow to our prestige in this country. And not only this, for, to my mind, whether the concession is given to Lynch or not is quite secondary, hut the point ot vital importance which ought never to be lost sight of is that, unless we control the navigation on the Tigris especially, we must inevitably lose our paramount position and the semi-monopoly of our Persian trade via the Persian Gulf and Bagdad which we hold to-day. . This is far and away the most important consequence which will result trom our loss of the control of navigation on the rivers. Even had we secured the control of the Bagdad-Bussorah Railway section, the control of navigation would have been essential; but if we lose both, then the result must be eventually a death-blow to our trade. The Cabinet have been playing a double game. They will naturally continue to do so until their game is won, unless action is^ taken by England. Judoing the Turk as I know him, if he is to he pulled up, it seems to me that the sooner it is done the better—and the more sharp the lesson, the more satisfactory and prompt will be the result.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 53 of the 31st ultimo, 1 have the honour to report that the Bill regulating the grant of concessions was laid before the Chamber yesterday. ^ A translation thereof prepared in the embassy is enclosed herewith. The immediate interest of this piece of legislation is the effect which it may have on the prospects of the fusion of the two navigation companies in Mesopotamia, and I must confess that, in my opinion, the situation has not been improved by its appearance. Both from the tone of the Grand Vizier in the conversation I had with him on this question, as reported^ in my above-mentioned despatch, and from the repeated refusals with which the Ministers of Public Works and of Finance have met Mr. WhittalTs attempts to discuss the question of compensation by means of a sinking fund, as suggested in your telegram No. 7 1 of the 3rd ultimo, there appear to me strong indications that the Government do not intend to take on themselves the responsibility of concluding an arrangement which they fear would in the present feeling of the Chamber fail to pass. Sections 1 and 2 of article 1 of the Bill will give them a fair ground for alleging that if they agreed to accept the present draft convention, with a clause providing for compensation to the foreign shareholders by means of a sinking fund, they would be laying themselves open to the charge of encroaching on the prerogative of Parliament, and I fear that a defence based on the argument that the scheme is not really a concession at all, but merely the confirmation of the existing rights of the two companies, would carry very little weight in the Chamber. I think there can be very little doubt, judging by the disinclination shown by the Ministers interested to discuss the matter at all with Mr. Whittall, that it is the intention of the present Government that the convention should not come into force without obtaining the sanction of the Chamber. Considering the strong pressure that His Majesty’s Government brought to bear on the Porte at the close of last year, and the amount of public attention engaged on this question, it would of course be very unfortunate that we should now allow it to drop ; but, on the other hand, I feel doubtful whether His Majesty’s Government attach sufficient importance to the case to warrant me in pushing matters to a point where the stability of the present Ottoman Ministry might be affected, and I therefore venture to request that you will furnish me with a general indication of the line I should adopt. I should add that there appears to be a growing feeling that the Government should not take any share in the proposed amalgamation, and that it would be better that the shares of any company enjoying monopoly rights of navigation on the two rivers should be in private hands. It is too early to say whether anything practical will result, but it seems to me not impossible that a solution of the difficulty might be found on those lines. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

'f 33, Font Street, London, February 16, 1910. reference to yonr despatch of the 14th instant, I understand that this despatch refers to the statement made a few days ago by the Grand Vizier to His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that he did not feel himself in a position to conclude the fusion between the two companies until he had seen the text of the new law to be submitted to Parliament on the subject of concessions. The Grand Vizier added that he hoped that there would be nothing in the text of the new law to prevent him from completing the transaction. I called this morning at the Foreign Office, and pointed out that the attitude taken up by the new Grand Vizier, namely, that he must await the appearance of the new draft law, would seem to be quite inadmissible when taken in relation to what has gone before. The question was very fully discussed by the Turkish Parliament in December last. On that occasion a motion was brought forw r ard by the deputy, Halil Bey, approving of the declarations made by Ministers on the subject of the proposed fusion, on the condition that the concession should be submitted to the Chamber for ratification. This motion was opposed by the Government, and it was eventually withdrawn, Hilmi Pasha giving the Chamber the assurance that, in return for full liberty to deal with and grant this particular concession, the Cabinet bound itself not to impose any financial obligation upon the budget. The motion having been withdrawn, another motion w T as substituted, of which the following is a translation “ The Chamber recognises the right of the Government to grant concessions which do not involve any financial guarantee on the part of the State, until such time as a law shall have been promulgated dealing specially with the subject of concessions. As regards the affaire Lynch, if the Lynch Company accept the proposals of the Government, the Government are empowered to grant the concession, inasmuch as no financial obligation is placed thereby upon the budget. The Chamber expresses its entire confidence in the Cabinet, and passes to the order of the day.” This motion was carried by an overwhelming majority—168 votes against 8 votes. It is therefore perfectly dear that, when last it dealt with the question, the Chamber, after a protracted debate, and by an immense majority, specifically authorised the Cabinet to conclude the fusion without any reference to Parliament, provided that the British company accepted the proposals of the Government, and that no financial obligation were placed upon the budget. The British company immediately complied with both these conditions. Some delay has been caused by changes in the Ministry, rendered necessary by the retirement of Hilmi Pasha ; but the Ministers specially conversant with the matter, namely, Javid Bey (Minister of Finance) and Halajian Effendi (Minister of Public Works), retain their portfolios. Since no action on the part of Parliament has taken place in the meanwhile, the Cabinet remains authorised to conclude the transaction on the terms cited above. Under these circumstances, I trust that His Majesty’s Government will hold the Turkish Cabinet to their pledges. The negotiations have already cost the British company a considerable sum of money, besides occupying their board incessantly for upwards of a year. Since my visit to the Foreign Office, I have received the following telegram from the representative of the British company in Constantinople, Mr. J. E. W. Whittall “ New law concessions : contains clause apparently aimed especially necessitate submission scheme Parliament; other facts confirm this view.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah reporting on the local feeling in connection with the proposed amalgamation of the steam-ship lines on the Tigris. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. IS k / ^ 7 Consul Crow to Mr. Marlinq. (No. 2.) Sir, Bussorah, January 5, 1910. WITH regard to the proposed amalgamation of the steamers belonging to the Idare Nahriye and Lynch lines on the Tigris, certain telegrams sent by the Bagdad deputies from Constantinople to their friends at Bagdad and Bussorah on the subject have elicited some symptoms of an anti-English demonstration here. Violent articles appeared in several newspapers protesting against the arrangement, and an uneasy feeling seems to prevail, principally among the uninstructed classes, that the naviga tion of the river is about to pass into the hands of an English monopoly. Mr. Lorimer informs me that similar excitement exists at Bagdad, but that the agitation appears to be the work of a few' interested merchants and financiers, who use patriotic and popular catchwords to stir up public opinion. I think the same may be said of Bussorah, but the feeling on the subject seems to be less acute at Bussorah owing probably to the influences at work being less powerful. The agitation at Bussorah has not assumed a serious character, and it is probable that the steps taken by the local authorities may check its development. On the 30th December the vali summoned the priests of the Christian and Jewish communities to the Serai, and, in the presence of a large crowd assembled there, read a telegram received from the Grand Vizier, which was to the effect that the steamers belonging to the Turkish Government had not been sold, but that a Turkish company was to be formed, in which the steamers of both lines were to be incorporated ; that four Ottoman subjects, chosen from among the merchants of Bagdad, wuuld be placed on the board of control; that part of the shares of the new company would be offered for sale in Bagdad ; that the company’s shares would not be sold to foreigners ; and that there was no harm in the amalgamation, which was still under consideration. The publication of this telegram seems to have had a salutary effect. The amalgamation continues to form the subject of animated discussion in the newspapers and bazaars, but I have not heard of any public meetings being held or formal resolu tions passed in disapproval of it.

In my conversation with him to-day, Count Aehrenthal remarked that, in his opinion, the new regime at Constantinople had taken a step backward in the appoint ment of Hakki Bey as Grand Vizier, and not a step forward. He thought Hakki was an honest man, but one who, instead of asserting himself, would merely be an instrument of the committee. His Excellency deplored the latter’s continued intervention in the control of the Government; this intervention did not promise well for the development of the constitutional regime on peaceful lines. The Minister also alluded to the Lynch concession. If the development of the resources of the more remote provinces of the Empire were too rapidly commenced, with European help, the committee, he seemed to think, would soon be alarmed.

Mr. Marling’s despatch No. 975 of the 21st December. If, as stated to Colonel Picot, by Haladjian, question of compensation is now the only point in the convention still in dispute, Mr. Lynch would assent to a scheme of fusion if the Porte would (1) Agree that any public body or company, excluding the Turkish Government, to whom a concession for irrigation might be given, should be required to compensate the navigation company as a whole if the river is rendered non- navigable ; and (2) Agree that in the event of a sinking fund being created by the new company to provide compensation for itself against damage to navigability of rivers, the fund should be used entirely to paying off British, but not Turkish block of original shareholders. Latter, being identical with Turkish Government, would clearly benefit by establishment of irrigation works, from which they could recoup themselves for loss of navigation; but former would be unable to participate in this source of compensation. In respect of any future emissions of capital, all shareholders would participate in such a sinking fund. Discuss these suggestions with Mr. Whittall, and give him support when and m whatever manner you may judge advisable, in putting forward first or both of them. But it will be necessary to obtain some assurance that irrigation works would be conceded to some foreign company if the first suggestion is put forward without the second. ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

Sir, / Constantinople, December 29, 1909, WITH reference to my despatch No. 975 of the 21st instant, I have the honour to report that, from telegraphic information sent at my request by His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad on the 26th instant, it appears that there is a very strong and universal feeling there against the proposed Lynch-Hamidieh fusion. Great agitation has been worked up, particularly in commercial circles, against the arrangement, chiefly, Mr. Lorimer thinks, under the impression that the new combination will be given preference in trade over other commercial interests. Before Bairam there was organised a regular popular demonstration against the arrangement, both at Bagdad and at Kazimie, and it seems not unlikely that this agitation will be resumed again. Patriotic feelings have been appealed to and also religious sentiments, and people on the spot, who have means of judging of the demonstrations, are inclined to fear real disorders. I have telegraphed to Mr. Lorimer, in reply, that the draft convention contains guarantees against such preference; and I trust that he may be able to do something to counteract the agitation which is being engineered in the district. This morning’s papers allude to recent disturbances at Bagdad in connection with this business, but I have received no news from Mr. Lorimer tending to confirm this. I have, &amp;c. G. M.

AS a result of the interpellation of the 13th instant, on which I had the honour to report in my despatch No. 973 of the 14th instant, the question of the fusion of the English and Turkish steam-ship companies on the Tigris has entered on a new and, I fear, not very promising stage. By accepting Halil Bey’s motion, which binds them not to conclude any arrange ment with the Euphrates and Tigris Company involving the Treasury in any liability except with the consent of Parliament, the Government have placed themselves in a very awkward dilemma. On the one hand, they have given His Majesty’s Government repeated assurances that they will effect the fusion, an essential part of which is that adequate compensation will be given to the new company in case the navigability of the rivers is interfered with by the projected irrigation works ; and, on the other, they cannot conclude a convention for the fusion containing this essential point without submitting the agreement to Parliament, and they assert that Parliament will never pass the convention if it includes compensation. They seem, in fact, to be between the devil and the deep sea, for if they fail to carry the fusion they are bound, by their promises to us, to resign, while if they complete the arrangement they believe that the Chamber will drive them from office. As I reported in my despatch above mentioned, Mr. Lynch’s representatives here informed the Government officially that they were willing to omit all mention of irriga tion, with its possible result of impeding navigation, involving a claim for compensation, as they knew that Mr. Lynch is entirely convinced that in the event of the stoppage of navigation the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation has a valid claim for compensation, and that this right would, on the fusion of the two companies, devolve to the new company if, indeed, it did not become stronger under the statutes of the new concern. They were led to believe—as I was myself—that the Government, by accepting this line of arrange ment, would be able to conclude a convention in which no mention of compensation was made, and, if attacked in Parliament, defend the arrangement by asserting that it involved the Treasury in no new liability, but merely left untouched an existing but unrecognised claim. _ . However, when Mr. Whittall and Colonel Picot called on the Minister of rinance on the day following the interpellation they found his Excellency entirely averse from adopting this line ; and, indeed, Javid Bey’s declarations to the Chamber on the 11th that the Government did not recognise that the present Lynch company had any right to compensation did not seem to leave much hope that this solution could be adopted. I may mention here also that the Grand Vizier and the Minister foi Foreign Affairs ave both stated that they could not take this line. Javid Bey, however, informed those gentlemen that the Government were quite persuaded that the proposed fusion was in the interests of the _ community, that t ey quite realised that the new company was entitled to compensation, and, indeed, could not come into existence without it, and that the Government would find a yay o keep their promise to His Majesty’s Government without violating the constitution or their engagement to the Chamber. Halajian Effendi has also spoken to tie same effect^arious r gals have been put forward for escaping from the dilemma, but on examination all of them have been found defective, the most promising being a suggestion that, in the event of an irrigation company being formed to farm the works proiected by Sir W. Willcocks, the Government would undertake to make it obligatory for them to indemnify the Navigation Company in case o e ra c on the rivers being stopped. The objection to this proposal is that it is at present the intention of the Government to keep the irrigation works m their own hands. When I saw Rifaat Pasha yesterday I took the opportunity of pointing out to him very plainly that His Majesty’s Government would certainly hold the Ministers to then engagement, and that, as we had no wish to see the present Government resign,I must ur^e on him the necessity of finding some issue of the impasse m which they had landed themselves. His Excellency said that the Government had every wish to act up to its assurances, but they had been pushed into a_ corner by the interpellation of the 11th instant, and had been absolutely compelled to yield to the sense of the House tha+ v any arrangement entailing any monetary liability must be submitted to Parliament, said that from what I had heard I was pretty well convinced that on the lSth instant Ministers could have got the Chamber to accept the principle of compensation, for their supporters had then realised that they were risking their tenure of office, and were practically obliged to obey orders ; it would, moreover, have been an excellent object- lesson m party discipline, and would have stiengthened the hands of the Executive against the vexatious interference of the legislature. His Excellency demurred to this, and referred to the parlous position in which the Government had been on the first day of the debate. • Meanwhile the Bairam holidays, which last ten days, are close upon us, nothing can be done, and it is to be hoped that during this time the Government will devise some means of overcoming this difficulty. I must confess that I am not very sanguine, but Mr. Whittall thinks it not impossible that some acceptable combination may still .be found. I propose to take an early opportunity of seeing the Grand Vizier and impressing on him the necessity of redeeming his promises to us. Colonel Pi cot left for England on the 20th instant.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .— (No. 973.) Sir, ^Constantinople, December 14, 1909. AS I ventured to forecast in my despatch No. 949 of the 6th instant, the question of the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers became one of confidence in the Ministry, which at one time came perilously near falling. Up till the 7th instant the Grand Vizier professed perfect confidence, but on the evening of the following day (Wednesday) Djavid Bey, the Minister of Finance, informed Mr. Whittall that he was very doubtful as to the issue. Up to that time he said the attack on the Government had been directed towards the intrinsic merits of the case in general, though more particularly towards the questions of the expediency of the monopoly, and so long as the discussion was conducted on those lines he had been confident of making a successful defence. At the last moment, however, an article in the constitution had been invoked which directed that the grant of all concessions entailing financial charge on the Treasury must be submitted to Parliament; he (Djavid Bey) did not see how the Government could meet this point, so long as there was a clause in the convention for the fusion of the two companies which stipulated for compensation being paid to the new company by the Government in the eA^ent of navigation being impeded or rendered impossible by the projected irrigation works. When Mr. Whittall and Colonel Picot came to talk the position over with me the next morning, we agreed that the Government could not be urged to violate the constitution, which must inevitably bring about its fall, and that the best solution would be for Ministers to announce their firm intention to comply with the constitution in this matter, and then, having explained the lines on which the projected fusion was to be negotiated, to request the Chamber to empoAver them by a vote of confidence to conclude the transaction. This suggestion was conveyed to Djavid Bey by' Mr. Whittall, not, of course, as coming from the Embassy, and the Minister agreed that this, the bold course, was the best to au.ujJL. Subsequently, however, Mr. Whittall and Colonel Picot, on second- thoughts, considered that as they had Mr. Lynch’s authority to agree to the omission from the convention of any mention of the results which might ensue from the irrigation schemes, and consequently also of compensation, they could by making a declaration to that effect to the Minister for Public Works put the Government in a position to state that the proposed amalgamation would not carry with it any charge on the Treasury, and an official letter to that effect was accordingly communicated to Haladjian Effendi, and it was with affairs in this position that the Government prepared to meet the Chamber for the interpellation on the 11th instant. But they were extremely nervous as to the result, for on the one hand the Senate had showed its hostility by bringing in a Bill providing that no concession could be granted without the sanction of Parliament, and, on the other, it was exceedingl}- doubtful in the confused state of parties in the Chamber (which I endeavoured to describe in my despatch No.' 949 of the 6th December) how any particular group would vote, and, moreover, Ministers were painfully aware of disaffection in the ranks of their own nominal supporters. That their apprehensions on this score were well founded was shown Avhen in the course of the confused and stormy debate last Satuiday -Halil (Munteche), the official leader of the Committee of Union and Progress party m the Chamber, brought forward and carried a motion condemuing the Government for desiring to accord a concession creating a monopoly and laying a charge on the Treasury. The defeat of the Government, however, once accomplished, seemed to appal its authors, and when, after a lengthy interruption, the debate was resumed, t e adverse vote, bv some process of reasoning unintelligible to any but an Oriental mind, was tacitly ignored, so that when the House finally rose the Cabinet appeared to be m a rather stronger position than in the morning. There can, I think, be little doubt that the chief argument employed was an appeal to the pro-English sentiments of the House, and that the means used to raisethem was to represent the Germans as the real instigators of the campaign against an English interest. By the evening of the following day it was generally understood that the Govern ment was practically safe, and on the 13th the vote of confidence proposed Halil Bey, the Committee of Union and Progress leader, who had carried a motion adverse to the Government in the earlier sitting, was agreed to by 168 votes to 8, with 45 abstentions. It is to be noted that the Greek, Armenian, and Albanian deputies, though in opposition to the present Committee Government, voted in its favour in the division owing to the British character of the “ Lynch fusion,” and Ismail Kemal Bey put in a motion alluding to the enormous services rendered by England to Turkey at the time the Lynch concession was originally granted. The effect of the vote is to authorise the Government, pending the passage of the Senates Bill mentioned above, to conclude the amalgamation on its present lines, provided that it involves no charge on the Treasury. The Government would seem thus to have achieved a notable victory, but, with Kiamil Pasha’s experience of last spring in mind, it would be rash to prophecy that their position is really secure. The enclosed extracts from the “ Stamboul ” give the best accounts of the proceedings in Parliament, # which, especially on the 11th instant, were so confused as to be scarcely intelligible to the deputies themselves.

(No. 968 S ir &gt; ^ Constantinople, December 13, 1909. 1HE German Ambassador spoke to me on the morning of the 11th instant on the subject of the Lynch affair, and animadverted with some warmth on an article which had appeared in the “Tanin” that morning, ascribing the opposition to the fusion of the two Mesopotamian navigation companies to German instigation. A copy of the article, as well as of another published in the same paper, is inclosed. The articles in question were both signed by the editor, Hussein Jahid, one of the deputies for Constantinople, and a leading member of the party of Union and Progress, of which the “ Tanin ” is the principal organ. His Excellency said that there was no foundation whatever for this assertion; he himself had given the strictest orders to the dragomans ot his Embassy that they should do nothing to encourage opposition to the project, while he himself had been careful to observe a strictly neutral attitude towards it, although, of course, when asked his personal opinion on the merits of the scheme, he had thought himself free to say that he was somewhat surprised that England should be pressing for a monopoly of the navigation, especially as even if it were not expressly conceded in the convention, the new company must in practice have a monopoly. As for the “ Osmanischer Lloyd,” he was sure that no one could complain of its articles on the matter. I told his Excellency that I had seen the article, and that I much regretted that such accusations should have been made. His Excellency’s assurances, however, gave me great pleasure as disposing of the stories which I had always been loath to believe that the German Embassy was partly responsible for the campaign recently got up against the proposed company; certainly I could not say that the criticisms of the local German paper bad gone beyond legitimate limits, and I had even on one occasion noticed an article that was distinctly favourable to the enterprise, but as for the monopoly I presumed that Mr. Lynch looked upon it as a necessity from a commercial point of view as without it it might be difficult to raise capital for the improvement of the navigation, such as dredging, blasting, &amp;c. Baron von Marschall’s disclaimers are, 1 have not the smallest doubt, literally true but, to use a popular expression, there are other ways of killing a dog besides hanging him, and the means employed in this case was the strong expression of his Excellency’s personal opinion that the new company ought: not to be granted a monopoly on the river. I have frequently been told that Baron von Marschall is fond of expatiating on this point, and the same evening I was witness of an instance, when after a dinner at a private house his Excellency held forth lor nearly an hour on the subject to a mixed audience that included a senator and a leading Greek banker, who will ot course repeat his Excellency’s pronouncements everywhere. The Ambassador presented his views with no little dexterity; he desired above all things to maintain the' presen t Cabinet, and the question was how to find a way for them out of their difficulty; but Lynch, unfortunately and unnecessarily insisted on a monopoly and the Government, having pledged themselves to grant a monopoly must submit the question of the concession to the Chamber—which is precisely what they had declined to do. Lynch ought to abandon the demand for a monopoly, and so extricate the Government from their difficulty. Unfortunately M. de Marschall descanted with much more insistance upon the iniquity of a monopoly and the uselessness of it in practice ; and I fear the impression left on the minds of his audience was that he was far more concerned to prevent a monopoly being accorded than to find means of avoiding a Ministerial crisis. As for the attitude of the “ Osmanischer Lloyd,” it is quite true that its remark on the affaire Lynch have been as a general rule unobjectionable, and on one or two occasions, even favourable, but on the other hand, it has seemed to me that special publicity has been consistently given to unfriendly articles which have appeared in other local papers. „ The same evening, Dr. Weitz, the correspondent of the “Frankfurter Zeitung informed me, as I understand at the German Ambassador’s request, that he had been [2546 u 4]- f 2 equally scrupulous in abstaining from any adverse comment on the Mesopotamian Mr^Weitz also informed me, very confidentially that Baron von Marschall had been so incensed at the attacks of the “ Tanin,” that he had called on Bifaat Pasha tW'j same day, and had obtained some kind of excuses from him, and also a promise that instructions would be sent to the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin to offer an apology for them. .. I fear, however, that the German assurances can only be accepted strictly au pied de la lettre, but there cannot be the smallest question but that those who. have shown so determined an opposition to the scheme have always felt that in doing so they could count at least on German approval, if not on German support; at any rate, if Baron von Marschall had really wished to observe the neutral attitude he now professes to have observed, it would have been easy enough for him to have let the opposition know that he discountenanced their action ; moreover, it can scarcely have been a coincidence that the attack on the Government for granting a monopoly should have followed immediately after it first came to my ears that the German Ambassador was discussing this particular point in a sense unfavourable to the British proposals. I may add that both the Grand Vizier and Bifaat Pasha have told me that Germany was our real opponent in this matter, while Javid Bey, the Minister of Finance, as late as Friday last sent me word through Mr. Whittall that the real backbone of the opposi tion was German hostility. Be the facts as to the part that the German Embassy and German influence have played in this matter what they may, one thing is certain, namely, that the general public here has looked upon the recent Ministerial crisis as being essentially a trial of strength between England and Germany. How far German influence has been excited actively against us in this matter is difficult to say, but in the opinion of most people competent to judge, it could scarcely have gone further without becoming overt, and its motive was clear enough, namely, to make us realise that German influence was still paramount in Constantinople, the consciousness of which would be calculated to make us more easy to deal with in the Bagdad railway question. Baron von Marschall’s change of attitude is due probably to two main considera tions, firstly, a doubt—which the issue has shown to be well-founded—whether the Government would prove to be as subservient as he hoped to German influence, which no doubt made it incumbent on him to secure a dignified retreat by denying any hostility to the scheme; and, secondly, the advances made by Dr. Gwinner to Sir Ernest Cassel for British participation in the Bagdad railway which should dispose his Excellency to a conciliatory attitude towards us. I have, &amp;c. CHABLES M. MABLING. In closure 1 in No. 1. Extract from the “ Tanin” of December 11, 1909. The Lynch Question, by Hussein Jahid. THE Lynch question is, firstly, a German intrigue, secondly a question of personal interest, thirdly a question of ambition. Miserable internal interests and considerations of personal greed, united with foreign intrigues, have in the end brought the country to a great crisis. They have brought us near another foreign crisis and face to face with the danger of alienating England completely. Moreover, those who have thus played with the country’s destiny have managed to pursue their selfish policy while throwing the entire responsibility on the Chamber. They tried to hoodwink the public, to take advantage of the hmh principles of deputies, to stir up feelings of patriotism and provoke the downfall of the Cabinet. Posts would thereupon be filled by self-seekers of the old or new school. The Germans would gain by this in two ways. Once the project was thwarted and their commercial supremacy in Irak was undisputed, they would be gainers, And they would also be gainers inasmuch as the Cabinet which came into power as a result of their intrigues, and which, in defiance of all common sense, had struck a blow at England would be thrown into their own arms. At the same time the rich natives wouldbe able to form a steam-ship company on their own account. As Caresso Effendi said, it is no question of tyrants, [ ? ] but merely that certain rich natives want to^ form a company. us examine the German intrigue, it is only by enabling our deputies to form an opinion on the secret sides of the matter that we can hope to avert a vital national danger. The question is not one for party politics, but a national one which may cause an upheaval in our foreign and home policy. To undeistand the German point of view we have only to follow the line taken by the “ Osmanischer Lloyd.” On the 8th October it says : “ There is no reason to suppose that the navigation concession, or even Sir Whlliam ^\illcockss scheme, would mean an invasion.” It considered it politic, though its mission was to maintain German interests, to appear to pay no attention to, or even to support, this scheme. On the 13th October it considered—in the same vein—that “ any difference between the Ottoman and British Governments would be very undesirable.” After this, the tone changed to the sensational. On the 24th October, the “ Osmanischer Lloyd 5 published an account of an imaginary meeting of the Grand Vizier, Halajian Effendi and others : (t The discussion was very animated. Some persons left the room. One proposal was that the concession should be postponed until the construction of the Bagdad line, i.e., until the Government should have strengthened its position in Irak.” Here we have German feelings showing themselves. Their only wish is to complete the Bagdad line. They know that once navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates is properly organised, there will be no need lor a railway. That is why they are trembling. They want to make the railway and establish their commercial influence there first of all and then have the navigation question arise afterwards. Their giving the secret away should open our eyes. We should realise that to oppose the Lynch question is to the. advantage, not of Turkey, but of Germany. The “ Osmanischer Lloyd,” then quite forgot its first attitude and announced on the 25th November that the British first dragoman went to the Parliament during a private meeting of the Lnion and Progress party; and this just shows how the “ Osmanischer Lloyd ” seeks to put a false construction on the smallest pieces of news, true or false. On the same day, it said “ the formation of a company like this would not really be a triumph for the Cabinet .... English influence at the Porte is growing daily.” And laying aside its first mask, it added that the Cabinet would fall on account of the Lynch question. On the 26th November, realising that our interests and policy were being sacrificed to German interests, the “Tanin” abandoned its attitude of reticence. The “ Osmanis cher Lloyd ” answered our first article by doubting whether the firman was in the name of the embassy, virtually accusing us of falsehood. We printed the firman, thereupon, the “ Osmanischer Lloyd ” became dumb, whereby it admitted the success of the Cabinet. Then the question of the Cabinet’s right alone to grant the concession afforded another gleam of hope. It seems as if the German paper desired the obstruction of the negotiations at any price. On the 9th December it said in despondent tones : “ There seems to be a change of opinion among the deputies in favour of the Cabinet.” Yesterday it based its hopes on the Senate. Ferid Pasha showed his hand almost as openly when he remarked, “ the telephone concession is being given away, too.” We have spoken openly and fearlessly because we consider it to be due to the country.

Sir, Pevci DccciJibcT 7 1909 I HA.VE the honour to transmit herewith for your information copy of a despatch from His Majesty s consul at Bussorah, reporting that permission had, according to the late Yah of Bussorah, been given to a certain Yusuf Abdul Ahad to form a company in order to run two steamers between Bussorah and Bagdad. From inquiries made at the Ministry of the Interior here, it appears that the application of Yusuf Abdul Ahad has been forwarded to the Ministry of Public Y^orks, which has so far taken no action in the matter owing to the pending Lynch nego tiations. I have, &amp;c. CHABLES M. MARLING. , Inclosure in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 54.) Sir, Bussorah, October 30, 1909. I HAVE the honour to report the following items of news received here regarding river navigation, which may be of interest. The late vali, Arif Bey, informed the Minister of the Interior in September last, that the vilayet had given permission to Yusuf Abdul Ahad to form a company in order to run two steamers between Bussorah and Bagdad. Yusuf Abdul Ahad, who is an Ottoman subject, is a Christian broker in the employment of Messrs. F. Strick and Co. I understand he has no capital of his own. No company is being formed as yet. About three months ago the vilayet gave permission to Aga Jafer, a Turkish subject, and formerly agent of the Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company, to run two steamers on the Euphrates. The “ Kazimi ” belonging to Aga Jafer proceeded in the summer to the Euphrates accordingly, but stuck on a sand bank, and has not yet been refloated. It is reported here that the steamers of the “ Idare Nehriye,” that is, the former Seniye steamers, have been sold at Constantinople to a foreign firm for £ T. 300,000. This report is not confirmed officially. Owing to the unrest in the Montific district, reported in my telegram No. 73 of the 16th October last, the Turkish gun-boat “ Alus ” proceeded to Suk-es-Shiyukh on the Euphrates. The river has fallen considerably, and the “ Alus ” is unable to continue her return journey below Hammar. The administrative council of the vilayet on the 22nd October decided to deepen the Ashar Creek from the custom-house as far as Bussorah. A portion of this creek near Bussorah town has now been closed to navigation preparatory to this operation, but work has not yet begun. The new vali, Nazif Bey, arrived by the British India mad steamer on the 29th October. He was not allowed to land at Mohammerah and proceed by river steamer as he proposed, but was placed in quarantine at Bussorah by the sanitary authorities. ^ No grain is coming down from up-river, and I hear there is great scarcity. A joint petition has been addressed by the inhabitants to the vilayet that imported grain may be exempted from customs duty. I have, &amp;c. E. E.

WITH reference to Mr. Lynch’s memorandum of the 4th ultimo on Mr. Marling’s telegram of the 2nd instant, and especially to the passage contained on pp. 2 and 3, ‘‘ I must also point out that if the British Government and ourselves were to give a formal annulment will be considerably weakened,” we understand from Colonel Picot that the Turkish Government lays special stress on the formal annulment of the rights of the present British company. You will observe that such annulment forms no part of convention “ C ” which has all along been under negotiations. Mr. Cave, K.C., advised us during the autumn (in the absence of Mr. Hamilton, K.C., upon his annual holiday) that if the Turkish Government were to demand such annulment it would be essential to introduce a safeguard to the effect that complete annulment should become operative only when the new company had been placed in full possession of all its rights under the convention. Colonel Picot reports that the Porte will not accept this safeguard. In Mr. Lynch’s memorandum, cited above, Mr. Lynch agreed that if His Majesty’s Government considered that in spite of formal annulment, even without Mr. Cave’s safeguard, it would be open to them to insist upon a restoration of the status quo ante in cases of non-fulfilment by the Turkish Govern ment of their obligations under the Convention, he would acquiesce in this view.^ We have now consulted Mr. Hamilton, K.C., upon the point, and we enclose his opinion. As the matter is of vital importance to ourselves, I have the honour to enquire whether His Majesty’s Government concur in the opinion expressed by Mr. Hamilton, K.C., especially as regards restitutio in integrum, in which case we should be enabled to meet the wish of the Turkish Government and to agree to the insertion of the annulment clause.

Lynch negotiations (see my telegram No. 352 of the 7th November). I hear from Rifaat Pasha that Council of Ministers has decided in favour of fusion but will insist on 50 per cent, of fully paid-up shares gratis, as well as on the acceptance by Lynch of the clause waiving compensation. With regard to the paid-up shares, Rifaat told me that it was not until about the 20th October that the committee of three Ministers had understood Whittall’s proposal for making the Government’s total holding up to the required 50 per cent, by ceding 5 per cent, in unpaid shares, and that they had believed that their demand was accepted until they had understood this point. As regards the scheme coming before Parliament, the Cabinet wdll have to answer interpellations, but will not submit scheme for sanction of Parliament. I think it is useless to insist on omission of clause regarding compensation, as the Government are not strong enough to agree to it, and I venture to repeat my opinion that Lynch’s interests will be best served by accepting the clause. I also venture to point out that, if Lynch agrees to Turkish demand regarding the shares, and the working capital is thereby reduced too far, it is possible for the company, under the powers arranged for it, to raise additional shares, of which half would have to be taken up by the Government here. I said nothing to Rifaat which might lead him to expect concessions on either point from us.ifS3b [This Docimeat is the Property of His Britanmt Majesty’s Govern™*™*] ,-1 . ,1 /, u5 ? 6 ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. •.V / CONFIDENTIAL. a ^OcQj^ |r VyK A'' hi v L/j [December 6.] Section 3. DEPW..-' [44352] No. 1. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 6.) (No. 940.) Sir, Constantinople, November 30, 1909. THE campaign in the press against the “ affaire Lynch,” as it is called, the lead in which has been taken by the “ Yeni Gazeta,” and which is organised by Sassoon Effendi, the Jewish deputy for Bagdad, who accompanied the parliamentary deputa tion to England last July, has grown greatly in violence of late, and public interest has been aroused to such a pitch that the Government thought it necessary to call a meeting of its supporters last week to explain the true state of affairs to them and assure itself of their confidence. The question, indeed, has become one of Cabinet importance. Sassoon Effendi, as also certain unofficial German agents in Constantinople and elsewhere, have been zealously spreading among the ignorant Arab and Anatolian deputies the idea that the monopoly of the navigation of the two rivers is a first step in the English political and territorial designs in Mesopotamia ; they have been loudly asserting that any monopoly is contrary to British economic principles, and that, if granted, this particular monopoly will be prejudicial not only to the private interests of Bagdad merchants, but also to the general development of those regions. Another strong point of attack is that the Government has no right to make any agreement of the kind contemplated without first submitting it to Parliament. Though the “ Tanin,” the official organ of the Government party, and the “ Tazvir-i-Efkiar ” have both rebutted these assertions, the campaign has been by no means unsuccessful, and has led to a formidable opposition “bloc,” which is causing no little anxiety to the Grand Vizier and to the Committee party in the Chamber. The Cabinet intend to uphold the proposed fusion as being consonant with the interests of the country, and while they deny that there is any necessity to submit the arrangement for parliamentary sanction, they profess themselves to be quite prepared to meet the interpellation which has been fixed for the 11th proximo. There are also indications that the Government is disposed to make this a test case to assert their right to conclude transactions of this nature without the interference of Parliament, as they foresee and appreciate the difficulty of dealing with business connected with the development of the Empire, if questions of the nature O-f the present one are to be blocked indefinitely by the delays inseparable from discussion in an inexperienced assembly such as the present Ottoman Chamber of Deputies.

CONFIDENTIAL. c [42595] [November 22.] Section 4. -Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 22.) (No. 911.) Sir, _ Constantinople, November ]5, 1909. IT would be tedious to recount in detail the various interviews which I have had with the Grand Vizier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Public Works on the subject of the fusion of the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company with the Hamidieh Company, but now that a definite stage has been reached in the negotiations I think that the enclosed memorandum hy Colonel Picot of the conversa tion he had on the 13th instant with Haladjian Effendi, will be of interest as showing the poin s in dispute and the lines on which agreement may be expected to be attained. Colonel Picot saw Haladjian Effendi again this morning and found his Excellency in a very conciliatory mood and ready to settle all outstanding points in a reasonable and equitable spirit. He informs me that he is encouraged to hope that the intervention will not be required for the present. I venture to offer some observations on a few of the points still under discussion. No. 2. The disappearance uf the Euphrates and Tigris Company .—The demand is made, I think, as much from amour-propre and from the necessity of being able to state in Parliament that • the English company has entirely disappeared as from any other, cause. The Turkish argument is that if the English company is being amalgamated with the Turkish, the former should, like the latter, ipso facto cease to exist and the argument seems not unreasonable. The Grand Vizier assured me that if it was desired that the operations of the English company should be continued on the Karun River, the Ottoman Government would not, nay, could not, raise any objections, but only desired that it should be done under another name. His Highness said that he thought it best to omit all mention of this Karun River. No. 5. Annul la tion of the Rights of the Euphrates and Tigris Company .—I am disposed to think that in refusing to accept the wording of the draft convention that this shall take place, “ des que la societe ottomane creee par la presente convention sera mise en pleine jouissance de ses droits et privileges,” the Minister of Public Works foresees that, with so vague an expression, it will always be open to the Euphrates and Tigris Company to argue that in some way or other the new company has not been put in full possession of its rights, and might claim in any case of dispute that it can be reconstituted on its former basis. He is naturally anxious to guard against such a contingency, and taking into consideration the Government’s direct interest in giving the new company every assistance, and also the great safeguard which British interests hold in the president’s casting vote, I am disposed to think that Mr. Lynch would be well advised in showing a measure of trust in the good intentions of the Government and waive the point. No 6. Equal division of fully paid-up shares .—Colonel Picot has just received a telegram stating that Mr. Lynch has agreed to the transfer of 5 per cent, ol the shares, it being of course understood that the working capital of the company will be diminished by the sum they represent, i.e., 16,000/. No. 7. Compensation in case of the navigation being stopped entirely or partially by the Mesopotamian irrigation works. —Haladjian Efiendi told Colonel Picot to-day that his Government quite recognised the equity of compensation, but a very short discussion of the various contingencies in which the claim might arise showed that the Minister had not studied the question at all comprehensively ; he, however, appeared ready to consider any points which might be brought up in a spirit of perfect fairness. As regard the sudden turn taken in the negotiations, I am unable to find any entirely satisfactory explanation. When 1 saw Rifaat Pasha on Wednesday night (the 10th instant) he gave me to understand quite unmistakably that the Government would not even admit the possibility of compensation in any shape whatever, noi did he deny, when I implied it, that Ualadjian Effendi was the sole obstacle to agreement; [2489 y—4]2 but the Minister for Foreign Affairs has in all my conversations with him shown such astonishing ignorance of the points in dispute that he may perhaps not even haT grasped what the Minister of Public Works’ views really were ; or, again, it is poss'l)] 0 that by showing an unyielding front he thought he could score a point or two for 'hi I * * * * 6 Government off' his own bat. It seems on the whole, however, more probable that 1 the very last minute Haladjian Effendi, who undoubtedly all along concealed the real aspect of the case from his colleagues as much as possible, realised that his obstinac* might bring about the resignation of the Grand Yizier and with it that of the whole Ministry; or else that Hilmi Pasha and the other Ministers have insisted on his coming to terms with the English company or, as an alternative, on his resignation. Be this as it may, the Government and the Minister of Public Works in particular have now committed themselves, as both the Grand Vizier and Haladjian Effendi informed me, to the fusion of the two companies and to bringing it about without submitting the scheme to the sanction of the Chamber. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Colonel Picot respecting his Interview with the Minister of Public Works on November 13, 1909. AT my interview with the Minister of Public Works on the 13th November 1909 I discussed with him the points at issue between the Government and the Euphrates and Tigris Companies relative to the fusion of the Turkish and British river services, which had been the subject of negotiations between His Britannic Majesty’s chargd d’affaires and the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs during the past three weeks. His Excellency stated that Government were prepared to conclude the convention on terms which he would detail to me. The Council of Ministers were awaiting the result of his communication to me before recording their final decision and instructing him to draw up the convention, “ cahier des charges,” and statutes. He had therefore to request me to give him a reply in writing. I informed him that I would transmit the proposals to Mr. Lynch for approval; this would necessarily mean delay. His Excellency replied that some delay was of no consequence now that the fusion had been decided on. He then went on to say that only two points remained to be settled. These were— 1. The question of the transfer of 5 per cent, of shares to Government as fully paid shares. 2. The question of compensation, should the navigation be destroyed bv irrigation. I said that I understood this to be the case, but that it would be more satisfactory if we went thiough the six or seven different points which had recently been m dispute, and had been the subject ol negotiations between His Britannic Ma]estv s charge d affaires and the Minister tor Foreign Affairs. The Minister expressed his agreement with this view, but asked me to treat his communication as “ officieuse.” The following points were discussed. My summary of his Excellency’s statements is taken from notes made at the time. These notes I read to his Excellency after the interview. He confirmed them as correct. J Points Discussed. 1. The form of the con vention. be that of Euphrates no longer It had been decided that the form was to a fusion between the Government and the and Tigris Company. Mr. Whittall would no iongf appear therein as ooncessionnaire. “ Concessional rights would be granted to the Ottoman company. Stated that he Prefer to see Mr. Whittall s name disappear altogether from the convention. There was no need for a third party in the case, but he might figure as the capitalist3 W 2. The importation of all material, ships, &amp;c„ free from customs duties. (Article 11 of the convention.) 3. The future status of i the Euphrates and Tigris Company. 4. Tariff. 5. The annullation of the rights of the Euphrates and Tigris Company. 6. Five per cent, shares transferred to Government to make up their holding to 50 per cent, the share capital. 7. Compensation in case of irrigation. Article 11 of the convention would stand good. . The Euphrates and Tigris Company must disappear. If the company continued its operations on the Karun, it should do so under a different name. There must be no special or differential tariff either as regards places or persons without the previous consent of Government. The maximum tariff' would, as stated in the convention, be based on the maxima of years 1907-8. The company would fix its own rates within the limits of the maximum. Notes .—The Minister explained that his intention in raising this question had been with a view of preventing special or differential rates which might favour one party or place at the expense of another party or place, and that Government wished to prevent abuse in this respect. The annullation of the rights and privileges of the Euphrates and Tigris Company would take place at the time of issue of the Imperial firman. The annullation would, as argued upon, receive the sanction of the Foreign Office. The following words used in the annullation clause as drafted by the Euphrates and Tigris Company should therefore be omitted :— “ des que la societe ottomane creee par la presente convention sera mise en pleine jouissance de ses droits et privileges.” Notes .—The Minister explained that the Ottoman company would spring into being on the issue of the Imperial firman, and would at once be entitled to all the rights and privileges of its concession. The Government would itself be the support of the company and any such proviso as the one in question was unnecessary, and, moreover, showed a distrust which was unwarranted. The Government would not tolerate this proviso. The Minister expressed the wish (16th November) that, as the beneficiary mentioned in the firmans and other documents, Mr. Lynch should also sign the annullation. It had been decided definitely that the shares must be transferred as fully paid-up shares. This decision was final. Notes .— I informed the Minister that it had been explained by His Britannic Majesty’s charge d’affaires to the Minister of Foreign Affairs that the transfer of these shares as fully paid shares necessarily entailed ^ an equivalent reduction (16,000/.) in the working capital subscribed by the Euphrates and Tigris Company, as the Euphrates and Tigris Company would not both transfer these shares and at the same time pay for them. His Excellency agreed that this was so. The Government reserved to itself the absolute right of carrying out such irrigation works as it might con sider desirable. The Ottoman company would have no riuht to raise any objections to irrigation, but should there at any time be a total cessation of navigation (“arret total”) owing to irrigation the Ottoman company would de facto, become entitled to reimbursement by4 the Government of its fully paid-up capital less the sum amortised. Further, should there he an “ empechement constant ” over a period of six months during the year the company would be entitled to consider this as an “ arret total and claim accordingly. The payment of this compensation would entail the transfer to Government of all the properties of the company. Notes .-.—The Minister explained that the justice of compensating the Ottoman company in case of total interruption of navigation was recognised, but Govern ment would only consider the question of compensation on the broad lines of an “ arret total” or an “arr6t constant.” Government would not enter into any dis cussion for compensation for partial interruption such as might be caused by shallow water during certain seasons.

He had already, about the middle of last September, consented to the omission of the paragraphs referred to in your telegram. With reference to my telegram No. 350 of the 4th instant I saw the Grand Vizier yesterday, who told me that, with the exception of that concerning the equal division between the two parties of fully paid-up shares, with regard to which the fear of parliamentary censure made it impossible to yield, he believed that &amp; settlement could be reached on all the points at issue. In order to attain to this, his Highness said he had been obliged to threaten the Cabinet with his resignation in the event of their disappointing the British Government in this matter, and thus impairing the good relations existing between them and Turkey. His Highness,_ who alluded only remotely to the compensation clause, concluded that the council of Ministers held to-day would definitely settle the question. I told his Highness that if the Porte insisted on their demand with regard to the partition of fully paid-up shares the company might start working without enough capital; he could not reasonably expect that Lynch should pay for shares which were not to be allotted to him.

LYNCH concession. 4 With reference to your telegram No. 690, an impression was made on the Ministers by the Turkish Ambassador’s communication ; nevertheless, they are at heart no more favourably disposed. Pifaat Pasha informed me that the Turkish Government did not wish for amalgamation, and that they were endeavouring to bring about a settlement simply with a view to gratifying His Majesty’s Government. Two days ago, after the council, the Minister of Education was delegated to interview Mr. Whittall on the five disputed points. The results were as follows :— It was proposed to settle the difficulties attending the form of the convention by making use of the expression “ exclusive right,” or similar words, instead of “ concession,” and by referring to Mr. Wittall not as a “ concessionnaire,” but as a “ capitalist.” The points relating to customs immunities and to the steam-ship service from Bussorah to Mohammerah have been virtually conceded. Mr. Whittall categorically refused both the demand of the Turkish Government that the British company should relinquish its rights as soon as the convention is signed, and their pretension to half the capital in fully paid-up shares; however, the Minister of Education believes that he may succeed in persuading his colleagues to modify their views on this point. _ _ The Minister of Education informed me that the Council of Ministers^ which would meet to-morrow, would decide both this question and that of the tariff, the latter question being one on which a compromise would be impossible. , . A further point has now been raised by the Turkish Government, who insist on inserting a clause providing that if the irrigation scheme renders the river non-naviga e the new company shall be unable to claim compensation. Willcocks has given them a written statement to the effect that the irrigation scheme may have this result m _ ve or ten years, and as Turkish Government rely very much on his opinion they are making their consent absolutely conditional upon the insertion of this clause. Please inform Lynch of substance of above. I venture to submit that it would be in the company’s as well as in our own political interests to accept this condition. My reasons are : 1. It is probable that the river will be navigable longer than Willcocks gave Turkish Government to understand; and # 2. The new company will be able to work on river above latitude of Bagdad eve after lower rivers are not navigable, whereas if the scheme for fusion falls t iroug 1 will presumably be impossible to obtain compensation when navigation is closed, a British interests will vanish completely.[ This Pgg HPrcgi-jiL ffi?.

The good faith of the Turkish Government would certainly be called in question if they were now to give the concession to any other company, and such action would create a very bad impression.

With reference to yonr telegram No. 688 of the 29th October, 1 saw the Grand Vizier and the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, and spoke most emphatically on the lines of your instructions. They both appeared to be far less hopeful of bringing the matter to a conclusion before the opening of Parliament on the 14th November than they were on the occasion of the Ambassador’s interview with them on the 21st instant. The Minister of Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs assert that the matter will have to be put before the Chamber. Sassoon and other deputies of Bagdad are chiefly responsible for the opposition to the scheme. They have organised a formidable campaign in Young Turk circles, and have succeeded in making it appear as though Lynch’s scheme, together with the projected British railways and the irrigation scheme, were the prelude to political designs on Mesopotamia and in Arabia in the future. They appear to he backed by Germans, and there are fairly conclusive indications that the same line is being taken by French financiers who are closely connected with the Deutsche Bank, and whose attitude is due to their annoyance at the opposition of the National Bank in the matter of the loan. The question will be deliberated on at the Conned of Ministers to-day, and Rifaat Pasha will communicate the result to me to-morrow. ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [October 31.] Skction 1.

(s — — [40833] No. 1. [November 6.] Section 2. Mr. Lynch to Foreign Office.—(Received November 6.) Dear Mr. Maxwell, 33, Pont Street, London, November 5, 1909. I ENCLOSE an extract from a long letter, dated the 1st November, received this morning from Colonel Picot. The rest of the letter I need not trouble you with, but I think this part of it will interest you. I think I am right in assuming that the late French Ambassador, M. Constans, left Constantinople for good some time ago. It ought, therefore, now to be possible for the French Government to keep their representative in Constantinople clear of the Franco-German financial schemes, of which the Imperial Ottoman Bank is the pivot on the French side. Surely it is monstrous that French policy in Constantinople should join in an attack of the nature described by Colonel Picot. It ought not to be possible for the directors of the Imperial Bank at Constantinople to be able to threaten the Turkish Government with the displeasure of the French Government—such displeasure to be made felt in refusing quotations on the Paris Bourse—if the Porte shows favour to British commercial interests in Turkey. I would venture to suggest that the time may have come when the French Government might be approached with a view to the dissociation of their policy at Constantinople from intrigues on the part of the French financial group against British interests and in favour of German interests. Yours sincerely, H. F. B. LYNCH. P.S.—When you have done with my memorandum on Mr. Marling’s telegram may I have it back for 'a day to take a copy, as I find the typist omitted to take one. Inclosure in No. 1. Colonel Picot to Mr. Lynch. (Extract.) November 1, 1909. THE situation has, during the last two or three weeks, become very complicated, and the reluctance of the Government to conclude the business has grown day by day. It is difficult to indicate clearly the causes which have acted on the Government. On Friday Javid Bey conveyed to Graves a message setting forth that political considera tions had arisen detrimental to the business ; that the Imperial Ottoman Bank and the Deutsche Bank had given the Government to understand that if further favours were shown Great Britain, by way of concession or otherwise, their Governments would hud means of expressing their disapproval of the favouritism shown to Bntis ers. It appears that the Imperial Ottoman Bank dropped some 200,0001. of prospective profit owing to Cassel’s competition over the 7 million loan. This hits both the above banks—the Deutsche Bank has a share in all Imperial Ottoman Bank loan business and vice versa —severely, and their discontent is keen. Javid Bey wished to ^ now lf th ® Imperial Ottoman Bank were threatening “ on their own, or whether the French Government were supporting them. ^ ... .,i Graves took the message to Marling, and Marling talked it over with me He believes that the Cabinet has been frightened by this intrigue, though he is of the opinion that the French Government knows nothing of it. I do not know what closed t0 ** ^ Snce Willcocks has been here I ^ve noticed ^ange also, Bagdad ^e and Mesopotamia, build railways, &amp;c.

They look upon our concession as the first sten in the accomplishment of British political ambition, and they have again been frightened. The question of the fusion has been put before the military staff, as it is supposei' | to have strategical bearings. * Then Sassoon has been working for all he is worth, bombarding the Minister of Public Works with telegrams, petitions, &amp;c. The communication from the Foreign Office to the Turkish Ambassador in London which was in writing, strengthened Marling as nothing else could have done, and the fact that the Cabinet has delegated the business to Nail Bey shows that Haladjian has lost some of his power for evil. We believe he is a German-paid instrument. Javid Bey is not as helpful as one might have expected, considering all our Government did for him over the loan through Cassel.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Msyesty s GovemmentJ ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. . ^ i Kl{ v, ^ i .. Ml iv CONFIDENTIAL. &lt;o\ v. [November 5.] At- Section 2. [40632] No. i. Mr. Lynch, M.P., to foreign Office.—(Received November 5.) Bear Mr. Maxwell, House of Commons, November 4, 1909. I ENCLOSE a memorandum on Mr. Marling’s telegram, which I trust you will find clear. By reopening all these questions at the last moment the Council of Ministers is evidently trying to wreck the negotiations, or, failing that, to beat time until Par liament meets on the 14th instant, when they will get Parliament to discuss the question and then shelter themselves behind an adverse decision taken by Parliament. This must clearly be prevented. Even were they to accept the convention before Parliament meets, there would still remain the statutes and the “ cahier des charges ” to be discussed; and, while this discussion was proceeding, they could still get Parliament to decide unfavourably on the whole question. I understand that the convention could not be actually signed until both these documents have been agreed. _ I think you will agree with me that, if this device is to be prevented, something really effective will have to be done at once. I should venture to suggest that the Turkish Government should be informed that, unless they are prepared to keep faith with us and with His Majesty’s Government, and to sign the convention without further delay, His Majesty’s Government will wait until the Porte sees its way to fulfil its promises,^ and will meanwhile break off the negotiations, so that there will be no proposal before the Turkish Government or Parliament, His Majesty’s Government at the same time suspending the negotiations for the increase of the customs duties on British trade with Turkey, a considerable portion of which trade has been created by the British river service in Mesopotamia ; also that, if in the meantime Parliament should deal with the matter and shut the door upon a revival of the settlement arrived at as regards the river service, His Majesty’s Government would view the matter in a very grave light. Y r ours sincerely, H. E. B. LYNCH. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Lynch, M.P., on Mr. Marling s Telegram of November 2, 1J09. THE phrase “ Bussorah moiety of service” in line 3 refers, I think, to a demand made by the Minister of Public Works that the present British company should under take to cease plying between Bussorah and the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab. Inis sernmn of the river is open to the flags of all nations, and the demand was therefore an impossible one. It appears that this demand has now been waive . 2. The next point raised in Mr. Mailing’s telegram concerns the form of the conven tion and a demand made by the Turkish Government that there shall be a cessation of the rights of the British company upon the signature of the convention If you will turn to the text of the convention that has all along been unde discussion, and in which the Turkish Government have promised uhat there shaU ^ no further essential changes, you will observe that it has e orm o a L p ment between the Turkish Government on the one- hand and Messrs. Picot and Whittall on the other hand. This is the form given to the convention by Mr Ham1 ^ order best to meet the object which both the Turkish Government and ourselves have in view, namely, a fusion between the two services. . ^ , Tnrlrkh The Turkish Government confides, cedes and temsfers the river service to Mr. Whittall, and the British company conMes cedes and trarmfes their rights into the same hands. Mr. Whittall on his part engages to form a new com pany to take over these rights, which company has to be an Ottoman company, subject to Ottoman law and flying the Turkish hag exclusive y. [2489 e -2]In order that there might he no doubt as to what tue lights of^ the new Turkish company are, articles 2, 3, and 6 proceed to define these lights in precise terms, and of course it would not be open to the Turkish Government heieafter to argue that the rights defined by these articles do not coincide with the rights cians- ferred, and that therefore the articles are of no effect.^ To that extent the convention has undoubtedly the nature of a new concession ; and it was always understood m ohis sense. The Turkish Government are now anxious to avoid giving it the ^ form of a new concession, by substituting the words “ exclusive rights^ for concession, and ky calling Mr. Whittall a “ capitalist ” instead of a “ concessionnaire.” . I have not consulted, our lawyers, but I can myself see no objection to this, because it seems to me that the substitution of the words desired by the Turkish Government does not affect the meaning of the convention as above defined. A s regards the demand made by the Turkish Government, that there should be a cessation of the rights of the British company upon the signature of the convention, permit me to endeavour to make the point clear to you. It is quite clear that undei the terms of the convention the new company which takes the place of the present British company is an Ottoman company, flying the Ottoman flag, and subject to Ottoman law. When, therefore, that company has been formed, it is plain that the British company will no longer be able to exercise its rights, those rights having been transferred to the Ottoman company ; but I understand that what the Turkish Government demand is a formal annulment, not only on the part of the British company, but also on the pait of the British Government, of those rights. I do not see how it is possible to confide, cede, and transfer” to the new company rights which have previously been formally annulled. The whole form of the convention would have to be recast. I must also point out that, if the British Government and ourselves were to give a formal annulment, as the Turks desire, it might be very difficult for the British Government to insist on the restoration of the status quo antein case the Turkish Government were at any time to endeavour to put an end to the new Ottoman company. Were such an attempt made, three courses would be open to the British Government: either to insist that the new company should continue its operations, or to claim the restoring of the status quo ante with compensation to the Turkish company for the loss of its fuller rights,_ or, finally, merely to claim compen sation and acquiesce in the disappearance of the British interest in the river service. The last course could not possibly suit the British Government, and therefore it is important that they should do nothing to render it very difficult to restore the status quo ante. I have considered it my duty to make this clear to you ; but I may say that, if the British Government do not regard the matter in this light,^ and if they consider that after a formal annulment it would be equally open to them, in case of a repudiation of their obligations by the Turkish Government, to insist upon a restoration of the status quo ante, I shall be willing to acquiesce in that view, and to recast the convention accordingly, although I do feel that if at this stage we consent to an essential change of this nature our case in resisting any further essential changes will be considerably weakened. 3. I think I now understand what Mr. Marling means by “half the capital in fully paid-up shares.” We undertook to supply a certain amount of working capital, to be represented by fully paid-up shares in the new company ; these shares gave us our majority of shares. When the Turkish Government insisted upon equality of shares, it followed that half this working capital would have to be subscribed by them. They now wish to keep their equality of shares, and not to subscribe the half of the working capital, but to receive the shares represented by this half without paying for them. I need not trouble you with this point further, because it is a purely financial one. 4. I come last to the point about irrigation. The article in the convention referring to this matter is article 12, paragraphs 3 and 4. The language of the article was drawn up by Mr. Whittall in consultation with the late Minister of Public Works. You will observe that it is very moderate and sensible language. I think it should be pointed out to Mr. Marling by telegram at once that his presumption that there would be no claim for compensation under present circumstances is incorrect. The British Government and the present British company have without any doubt very important vested interests in the navigation of these rivers, and if this navigation were endangered by an irrigation project the company would certainly assert its vested interests. 1 may point out to you that this is also the view of the Minister of Public Works. On the 20th October, in the course of Ms interview with Colonel Picot, he asked that the paragraphs in article 12 relating to irrigation should be omitted, on the groundthat, to use his own words, “ Government is by law responsible for any damage done to the concessionnaire by its own acts.” He therefore regarded the irrigation paragraphs as superfluous. &amp; r r I am prepared to omit these paragraphs should you consider it desirable to do so W to allow our case to remain as it now is, though 1 do so with some reluctance as f think the paragiaphs m question are valuable indications of policy; hut of course we could not for a moment entertain the proposal that we should worsen our position by consenting to forgo any claim Not only would we be worsening our position, but we should also And it very diflicult to obtain any new capital for the development of the navigation. r I hope to send you later the correspondence from our agents in Bagdad reporting the recent interviews_ with Sir William Willcocks. Sir William assured them that not only would the navigation not be impaired by his schemes, but that it would be positively improved. « November 4, 1909. H. P. B.

The Minister of Public Works discussed yesterday with Colonel Picot the convention, “ cahier des charges,” &amp;c., and raised certain points which he claimed to be unessential. These were points regarding customs immunities, the tariff, the service on the Karim River, and others upon which no agreement had been arrived at. In consequence of this I pointed out to-day to the Grand Vizier and to Rifaat Pasha that it was not in accordance with their previous engagements to raise these points. I also hinted that the 4 per cent, negotiations might be jeopardised by their persistence in doing so. In reply, I received a most emphatic assurance from Hilmi Pasha that a satisfactory settlement will be concluded. His Highness even told me that sooner than not keep to his engagement he would resign, and that he had emphasised to his colleagues the fact that he was pledged to me to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion. . . His Highness has invited Lynch’s representatives to discuss the matter with him before the next meeting of the Council of Ministers.

This suggestion is entirely incompatible with the arrangements for amalgamation with the Seniyeh company, and would undoubtedly imperil the success of the whole affair. I fear that no further action on my part will be of any use unless Lynch can at once accept the present proposals as they now stand. It would perhaps be well to inform immediately and clearly Lynch of this, as if he can accept the convention at once the matter can be dealt with at next Sunday’s Council of Ministers, while, if his decision is not given before the Bairam fetes, a delay would result which must be prejudicial.

After this period has elapsed either the river to be thrown open to the Turkish flag, including our company, or the Turkish Government to have the power to conduct the service as a Government monopoly, purchasing the property of the company at an expert valuation. n n j ^ His Majesty s Government will note that these are essential changes in the convention, and that the proposal of die Minister of Public Works constitutes a breach of faith on the part of the Turkish Government. The price our group has agreed to pay to the Turkish Government is 161,000/., and their properties are not worth more than about 30,000/. The balance was calculated on the basis of the new rights conferred under the convention. We should, however, be willing to concede to the Turkish Government the option to repurchase the exclusive part of the rights conferred at the end of thirty-seven and a-half years as proposed by the Minister of Public Works. But, as our repre sentative m Constantinople warns us that the Turkish Government are ’always taking up new ground, and as they have already broken their promise not to introduce further essential changes, we think you will agree that some very definite assurance should be given to His Majesty s Government by the Turkish Government that they are in agreement with our representative on all other points arising out of the conven tion, statutes, and cahier des charges before our definite acceptance of this last concession is communicated to the Turkish Government. As regards the further demand of the Minister of Public Works, that the Govern ment shall have the right at the end of the period of seventy-five years to put an end to the new company altogether, I must point out that the clause in the convention expressly negativing this course was expressly accepted by the Turkish Cabinet on the 22nd September. I trust that His Majesty’s Government will not permit the Turkish Government to go back on that decision. It would mean the complete surrender of all the British rights of navigation—rights which arose out of two costly expeditions equipped by the British Government, that of Colonel Chesney in 1835-37, and that of Commodore Lynch in 1837 and following years. I cannot believe that His Majesty’s Government will be willing to make such a surrender, though I have advocated that we should so far trust the reformed Government in Turkey as to confide them to a new company under Ottoman jurisdiction.

Government proposes, as regards right of preference after seventy-five years that new Ottoman Company should continue to run, but without monopoly or preference In the case of the Regie and other such companies started under thLld regmn the Government has found it impossible to get better terms by competition, and, fs in he case of the Mahsousse concession now being granted, feels it imperative to introduce a re-purchase clause. I pointed out the objections to this, mainly that considerable Persian transit trade, now safe under Lynch’s management, may suffer if company passes into less efficient hands. Government proposes to meet this objection bv inserting a clause to buy out after say, twenty-five years, not the company, but only its exclusive right, indemnifying it for this by a sum to be fixed by arbitration and engages not to grant any other monopoly ; river to be free to all Ottomans, including Ottoman Company. Government adds that no new points will he raised, and declares the insertion of clause on the above lines essential in order to combat the certain opposition of Sassoon and other Arab deputies to exclude rights being given to a foreign-managed company ; also that without such clause concession cannot he granted without o- 0 i n g before Parliament, whereas if the above clause he accepted they will conclude convention at once. The determined opposition of Sassoon and other applicants who are coming forward with more favourable terms than Lynch is real, and without expressing an opinion on the business side of the matter, it would seem that after, say, twenty-five years tne new company s position will be so consolidated, and its properties so enhanced in value, that no other company will be likely to put up the considerable capital required to enter into competition.

Dear Mr. Max/.ell: - With reference to our conversation of this afternoon upon the Turkish proposal:- If the President dies or resigns control falls to the Turkish Vote which might elect a President not approved by us. Further if any Director were to die or resign, control again would fall to the Turkish Vote, if such Director were one of ours, as the Presi dent could not exercise his casting vote. In fact the Turkish proposal is extremely ingenious, only it won’t work. Otherwise I have no doubt our American cousins would have thought of it before. It might be made to work if you divide the shares into two blocks and empower each block to ap point its four Directors, the British block appointing the President with the casting Vote. Then the clock fills up its own vacancies. But the practical oojec- ) { tions to this are very great. iou divide the Company \ into two camps. It needs no great stretch of imagina tion Ti .1ima^ina.,iOij. t'3axi2is o.ns want* cf sriioouhnsaa t t-o put* it at the lowest, in the proceedingc of a Board const! tuted in this way; and in case of appeal hy the Com pany to the Courts in any question the Company might he seriously prejudiced by the existence cf such a state of things. It is no concern of the Foreign Office whether we or the Turks do a little better or a little worse in coming to terms. But it is of concern and of very pressing interest to the Foreign Office that the con trol shall in this case be effective and that it shall be given in a reasonable way. The only reasonable way which is known to me is the usual way of control by a majority (it may be quite a small majority) of shares. I think that if this is clearly pointed out to the Turkish Ministers, and if they are clearly given to understand that our consent to much larger conces sions will be dependent on their consent to this, the matter should go through without further delay on satis* factory lines. Failing this, we must; I suppose fall back upon the block system. But I cannot advise its adoption asit is 'beset 'by such great practical difficulties. I t xiss: Colonel Pi cot states in Ms telegram that he has been warned twice yesterday that Ministers must receive an answer yes or no to their proposal by early on Saturday morning, otherwise H they proceed to decide on other offers”. They have been keeping us months waiting and now they want an answer in two days to an unthought out proposal of this kind. I rely on your kindly telegraphing to the Ambassador this evening re questing him to inform Ministers that so early a reply cannot he sent to a proposal which is receiving the consideration of His Majesty's Government.

I HAVE th e&gt; honour to forward to you herewith copy of a very interesting despatch which I have received from His Majesty s consul-general at Bagdad on the subject of the navigation of the Euphrates. As a result of a journey which he recently made down that stream in company with Sir William Willcocks, Colonel Ramsay has entirely changed the view which he had previously entertained of the value and importance of the Euphrates as a water-way. I have allowed Mr. Edwin Whittall, who is acting as agent for the Lynch Company, to peruse this despatch, m the belief that it might assist and guide him in his negotia tions with the Turkish Government for the acquisition of the Seniyeh steam-boat flotilla. There has been considerable ambiguity as to who were the people who desired to purchase these boats, as it appeared that a certain Mr. Theodoridi and a Mr. Callos were working on behalf of Sir George Mackenzie, whilst offers were being made on behalf of a third pprty by a Mr. Tucker. It was consequently very useful to learn from your telegram No. 344 of the KHh instant what the real state of affairs was, and that Messrs. Lynch were the only serious applicants. I have the honour to enclose an article which recently appeared in the “ Tanin ’ r written by the member of Parliament for Bagdad, Sassoon by name, opposing the projected transaction. At a recent interview with the Grand Vizier I discussed the matter with his Highness, who told me that the negotiations with the representative of the Lynch Company were proceeding favourably, and that the Government were altogether well disposed towards the scheme ; he had, he said, criticised Sassoon for his article, which was not sound, for it was essential to introduce foreign capital to open up the resources of the country, and it was not possible for Turkish enterprise to grapple with the task unaided. He did, however, raise the objection that Lynch’s charges were unduly high, but he seemed to be satisfied when I pointed out the obvious reasons which necessitated high freights—the unhealthiness of the climate, the difficulties of navigation, and above all the interruption due to the lawless conduct of the riparian tribes. I have therefore, at the present moment, good reason to hope that these important negotiations will be brought to a successful issue. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Ramsay to Sir G. Lowther' (No. 374/40.)* Bagdad, April 16, 1909. I HAVE the honour to inform your Excellency that a journey down the Hindiyeh and Euphrates rivers in company with Sir William Willcocks has given me cause to revise the opinions expressed in my letter No. 916/117, dated the 19th October, 1907, regarding the possibility of profitable navigation of the Euphrates for commercial purposes. I based my former report on the best information that I could obtain in bagdad, where the inclination has rather been to look upon the Euphrates and fiindiyeh &lt;£ canal ” as passing through wild and disordered countries mostly populated by Bedouin Arabs. Sir William Willcocks is of opinion that the Hindiyeh “canal” is no canal at all, . &gt; fBe Hindiyeh has formed the main stream of the Euphrates from time The fiesUexisting map of the Hindiyeh is that published by the War ce m 1907, and it is very far from accurate, even the important town of Hindiyeh, or lowarij, is placed about 8 miles too far down stream; the names of the great majority of places are not to be found on the map—in fact, it may be said that the map ■ - [2298 x—l] . B2 reproduces nothing more than a rough sketch survey, probably made by a man havW no knowledge of the language of the country. The Euphrates proper, from the Hindiyeh barrage to bamawa, is now dry at all times except during a very high flood. Frorn Samawa, where the Hindiyeh and th/ Euphrates used to join, to Bussorah we were aole to refer to a copy of a survey made by Lieutenant H. A. Ormsby, of the Indian Navy, between the years 1826 and 1830; this is drawn on a scale of about 2 miles to the inch, but we ound that many features of the ground had changed to such an extent that the map is now of no practical 2. March 13.—We went from the Hindiyeh barrage to Kifl, passing the town of Hindiyeh. Throughout this day both banks were cultivated with water lifts, and also by some canals where the levels allow of this. Hindiyeh is a very prosperous little town, and is a point of debarcation for Karbala. chanced to pass it on a day peculiarly sacred to the Shiahs, and found it filled with immense crowds of pilgrims who had come from the villages down the river. In front of the Hindiyeh must have been moored from 150 to 200 sailing craft of various sizes. The town also contained enormous quantities of rice. Kifl is a small place, chiefly noted as containing the tomb of the Prophet Ezekiel. March 14.—Kifl to Hamidiyeh. A small distance below Kifl the river divides into two branches, the right branch, which used to be the most important, goes to Kufa, which is the place from Avhich Nedjef draws its water supply, while the other branch, which we followed, is called the Shamiyeh channel. The Kufa branch is rapidly silting up. By floating down stream all night we reached Hamidiyeh in the early morning of the 15th March. This place is not marked on the maps, but it is a remarkably prosperous place with a bridge of boats, a bazaar, large gardens, and a considerable population. From this place Nedjef bears 280°. March 15.—As we had met a steam-tug at Hamidiyeh we were able to get from there to Shinafieh in one day. At about 20 miles below Hamidiyeh we reached a village called Kharam, which is a town of huts rather than a village, and about 4 miles below Kharam we entered the lake which extends from here to Shinafiyeh. Our boat was drawing about 3 feet of water, but we had no difficulty in the lake except when our captain, owing to want of decision, took a course between two channels. March 16.—Nine hours’ steaming, at about 5 or 6 miles an hour, took us to Samawa. During the whole of this time the river is between fairly high banks, and few people or cultivation are seen. March 17.— Samawa to Nasiriyeh. For the first 20 or 25 miles there is practically no cultivation, except quite close to the town of Samawa, but after this there are scattered areas of cultivation by water lift until the palm groves of Nasiriyeh begin about 3 miles above the town. March 18. —Nasiriyeh to Suk-es-Sheyukh. The date groves are almost continuous in many stretches on both sides of the river. March 19. —Suk-es-Sheyukh to Medina. We did not continue down the Suk-es- Sheyukh channel, but returned about 2 or 3 miles up stream and took the Saffah channel leading to and across the “ barka ” (i. &lt;?., Lake of Himmar). It was seven and a-half hours from the time that we entered the lake by a very sharp and awkward turning in the channel to the time that we again got into comfortably deep water. At many places we had under 3 feet of water, and the bottom, though not really hard, is distinctly firm. From the place where the open lake ends there is a well-defined and deep channel running through thick reeds on both sides. The swamps appear to extend on each side as far as the eye can reach. March 20. Medina to Gurna. There is a deep channel with extensive swamps on both sides, but a large number of palm trees are visible on the banks which sometimes appear between the channel and the swamp. Medina is really on a backwater, as the Euphrates now runs from the lake to Garmat Ali, where it loins the Shatt-ul-Arab about 10 miles above Bussorah. steam-tug had been hired by Sir William Willcocks, who had kindly asked me to be his guest, I could not delay it with a view to making any detailed observations or enquiries, but the following remarks may be of some value :— 3. Difficulties of Navigation.—On the day on which we left the Hindiyeh barrage, t e riv 6** wa s metres above low water, and was slowly falling. As far as I could judge, there are only two places between the barrage and Gurna, where any steamer, at present running on the Biver Tigris, would have any difficulty. For most of the time we followed a broad, deep, and well-defined channel'j'here may be difficult places in the Shinafiyeh Lake, but it appeared to have a 11 marked channel through it, and the only time that we grounded was when we got We f of the channel. If there is any place in this lake where want of water would prove 0U rfficuilty it is towards the down stream end of the lake. When we passed through 5 k e ^6 water was sufficiently low for the edges of the channel to be visible in most \ 3 a h u t if the water was higher it would be very difficult to find the channel unless places, ^ ^ lt Wa The other difficult place is on what is known as the “ barga.” Enquiries made by d to show that we had taken the worse of the two channels : along the Saffah U t nnel which we took, there was only about 3 feet, or slightly less, of water, and on P11 tering the lake, there was a very awkward turn at the site of an old earthen bmik used as a regulator, round which I do not think that any of the river steamers could have^steere^.^^^_^^^ r om ^ barrage to t h e end of the Shinafiyeh Lake, there • eontinuous cultivation on both banks, and the traveller is never out of sight of many i, tP proves Where the banks are high, wheat and barley are grown, and lower down there is an enormous area of rice cultivation, which is far more profitable than winter crops which are ruined by floods every second or third year. In the direction of Diwania also there are large areas under cultivation, though these are not visible nom thevLv.

While it is true that if the Government acts upon the investigations of Sir William Willcocks, and speedily proceeds to the clearing of the river and the opening of canals, the productivity of the land will increase several times over, yet, unless the import of goods is facilitated or to put it bluntly, unless the monopoly of navigation is destroyed and freights reduced it is perfectly certain that the expected advantage will be fruitless. “ The Civil List, after taking charge of the boats above mentioned, and recently buying and adding other steamers, understood, as a result of their experiments for the last ten years, that they would be unable to ‘ turn the wheel of business,’ and after the July revolution they had the idea of selling the service with buildings, fittings, and accessories to the Lynch Company on condition that the steamers should be run under the Ottoman flag. Fortunately the recent successes resulted in the service being handed over to the Exchequer, and the negotiations, which had almost been concluded, remained suspended, so that there is no fear that the trade of Irak will suffer such a blow as to be handed over from the monopoly of two companies to that of a single and above all a foreign company. “ Our object is not to enter into the question whether the Treasury will continue the service, or whether it would be successful if it engaged in maritime trade, but to suggest that the Ministry of Finance should work the administration itself, should lease it to somebody else, or should throw open the navigation of the Tigris to all Ottomans, as permission was given to the Lynch Company to this effect, both some time ago and individuals. “ With the increase in the number of boats and companies, the carrying trade § tflJ). l() l/h (T)- / o t,X No. 528, dated Baghdad, the 25th May 1909.

Sir, 1 have the honour to invite a reference to Your Excellency’s despatch of the 31st December 1908, informing me that it was the intention of the Turkish Govern ment to maintain, in one form or another, the monopoly of the right of steam navi gation on the Tigris, hitherto enjoyed by the Seneya Department. 2 The local papers have recently published a telegram from the Minister for Trade’and Public Works, dated the 15th March 1909, of which I give a brief trans lation below: I also enclosey the lurkish t Not foi India. ^ ex t as published in Baghdad. “Acknowledges the Yali’s telegram of the 14th February 1909, in which he re presents that the existing steamers are insufficient for the commerce of the country: that river freights therefore sometimes rise so high as to be a burden on commerce : that in consequence of this trade is being diverted to Muhammerah, and that per mission should be given to form an Ottoman Navigation Company whose members should be Ottoman subjects, and which should be allowed to employ steamers on the Tigris for purely local traffic or for longer journeys. ” In reply the Minister states that no trace can be found either at Baghdad or Constantinople of any concession of a monopoly having been formally gran e o the Seniyeh, and that consequently the Yali can give the permission for which he asks on Hie following conditions, provided those who wish to run steamers g lve a bond certified by the Notary Public containing the following conditions: {a) the steamers shall fly the Ottoman flag; (h) the applicants with their share holders shall be Ottoman subjects; (c) existing and future regulations shall be observed; (d) the permksffin shall not be transferred to foreigners; (e) the permission shall grant no exclusive rights; (/) the freight tariff shall be agreed upon between the appli cants, the Chamber ot Commerce and the Council of the Vilayet; {g) an amoun , to be agreed upon, shall be assured to the municipality. 3 The above paragraph gives an account of what was published m the Pressthe Tigris should be largely increased so as to bring down freights _ and so prevent the trade from being diverted to the Karun route. 4. It is difficult to see why the river traffic, which is largely international should contribute to the municipality and I doubt if it is practicable to fix a tariff of charges, because the freight which merchandise can pay, and which the shin- owners can accept, is dependent upon so many contingencies which are beyond local control. j ? - * . , &gt; The most important matter is the ruling that shares are not to be sold to foreigners. There are many persons better fitted than myself to discuss the right of the Turkish Government to issue such a rule, but from the local point of view I think it is unfortunate. I have no confidence in the capacity of any local company to organise a steamer service without foreign assistance and advice, and it is doubtful whether the Government will manage the Turkish steamers as efficiently as they were managed by the Seneyeh Department. Consequently it seems to me that there is a danger of the river transport arrangements deteriorating at a time when great demands are likely to be made on it, as the country develops under the influ ence of irrigation works. I therefore venture to suggest that an attempt should be made to induce the Turkish Government to throw both the rivers open to competition, on the condition that foreign-owned vessels shall fly the Ottoman flag, and comply with the Laws and Regulations concerning river shipping. &gt; ...

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey. —{Received July 12.) &lt;No. 501.) Sir, Constantinople, July 3, 1909. I HAVE the honour to _ forward herewith a despatch from Mr. Crow, consul at Bagdad, reporting on a Turkish proposal to increase the number of steamers on the Tigris, and to start a Turkish company for the purpose. These proposals were made before the negotiations had been begun with the Lynch group. I HAVE the honour to enclose an abstract of a letter from the Minister of Commerce and Public Works, which lately appeared in a local newspaper, regarding a proposal emanating from the vilayet of Bagdad for working more steamers on the Tigris. In his letter the Minister of Commerce recapitulates the reasons for the proposal, as stated in a telegram from the vali of Bagdad, which are to the following effect:— “ Transit trade with Persia via Bagdad and exports from Mesopotamia are on the increase, and the Hamidieh steamers and Lynch’s three steamers are insufficient to handle it; moreover, the monopoly hitherto held by the above-named steamers has raised freights to a rate which is prejudicial to commerce. For this reason transit trade with Persia is passing to Mohammerah; it is therefore essential to increase the number of steamers on the Tigris, and the proposal to start a Turkish company for the purpose, and also to ply steamers on either side of Bagdad and to convey passengers to Garrara, deserves support.” I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s consul- general at Bagdad. As far as the vilayet of Bussorah is concerned, I think the number j of steamers now plying on the Tigrs is enough to carry the trade. Lynch have three and the Hamidieh administration seven. The river is very low for half the year, and more steamers would, I think, prove an encumbrance and hamper navigation in the narrow reaches below Amara. In any case some attempt should be made to improve the present defective conditions of navigation before more steamers are put on. I have no information which leads me to suppose that the transit trade with Persia is being deflected to Mohammerah, and I do not believe it. Through river freights to Bagdad are very high : 29s. 3d. by the British and 28s. 6d. by the Turkish line per ton weight for general cargo ; and for sugar per ton of 1,000 kilog., 27s. by the British and 25s. 8d. by the Turkish line in 1907. Owing to trade depression in 1908, downward cargo was more plentiful than upward cargo. The through cargo rates for 1908 and 1909 are about the same as those for 1907. The rate for local cargo, Bussorah to Bagdad works out at 32s. 6d. per ton by the British and 55s. 6d. per ton by the Turkish line. Consignees have some cause to grumble at these very high freight rates. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 35.)

The Yali saw no objection. I then went to see the Vali, who quite approved of the proposal, provided I did not hold him responsible for the conduct of the .vrabs in the Basrah Vilayet. I said that I had nothing to fear fron the Arabs, but that I should like it if he could arrange natters so that the Vali of jasiah should not be obstructive or send alarmist telegrams to Constantinople, and as an example of what I meant x reaa i0 His Excellency a telegram which had been reproduced in ’The Tines' stating that the British had been occupying strate gical positions on the Shat-el-Arab. hajn-ud-dm Jey seemed a little doubtful about the Vali of Basrah, so he suggested that he should telegraph in cypher to the^randVizier saying that it would, save time and money (to the Turkish Govt.) if I could take Sir William and suggesting that instructions should be sent to the Vali of Basrah to give any assistance that might be needed. We decided that if the Grand Vizier agreed to the proposal the Vali should inform me, but if the Grand Vizier objected the Vali was to tell Sir William that he had hotter not ask me to take him in the u Goiaet ,: . The Grand Vizier was informed that I pro posed to start early on the 2nd march. When no ansver came on the 1st March I again saw the Vali and he agreed to my starting and gave me a kaptieh in case an v Turkish officials might make objections. Unfortunately I was not able to get off on the early morning of the 2nd March, and at about midday a telegram came from the Grand Visier saying that M there might be objections' 5 to Sir William going in the | “Comet' and that it would be better if he were to hire another steamer. When this message cane I gave up all idea of taking the 'Comet' up the Euphrates. I regret that the negotiations should have failed, but we have lost nothing, for the conversations bet - ..een me and the Tali as wen as Vali’s telegram show clearly that the question under discus sion was not whether I could take the 'Comet 1 up the Euphrates, but whether the Turkish Govt. v r ould like its Engineer to ask me to take him up in the 'Comet’ . The next time I am at Basrah I propose to take the 'Comet' a short way up the Euphrates, nominally in search of good shooting, but really to get the Basrah Vilayet officials accustomed to seeing the ship pass Gurna on the Euphrates.

I presume that other nations would be entitled to equality of treatment, but it need not be given until it is 91 l.t r in olaimed r,nd it would be a greet advantage to us if we could get permission first and actually get some steamers on the river before our foreign rivals had given the matter their attention.

THE attention of His Majesty’s Government has repeatedly been drawn of late to the extreme insufficiency of the existing means of river transport between Bussorah and Bagdad, and the resulting agglomeration of imported goods at the former port. According to information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government, very large quantities of merchandise, amounting to many thousands of tons, which are mainly of British or British-Indian origin, have been for months past accumulating on the quays or in barges at Bussorah awaiting the means of conveyance.^ Not only do these delays in themselves result in serious inconvenience and loss to the owners or importers of these goods, but, in consequence of the inadequacy of the Custom-house accommodation at Bussorah, to which His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy has frequently had the honour of calling the attention ot the Sublime 1 oite, the goods thus accumulated are subjected to a further risk of damage, loss, or deterioration through damp, defective storage, and exposure to the inclemencies of the weather, involving abnormally high rates of insurance, frequent contestations, and serious injury to the interests of all the parties concerned. , . , . The very numerous complaints which have been received on this subject iiom exporters, importers, and underwriters alike suffice to prove the existence ot a very real grievance for which an immediate remedy is imperative, and the continuance ot which His Majesty’s Government could not contemplate without serious concern, ine Sublime Porte* is fully aware that the protection and development of British commerce in all parts of the Ottoman dominions is a subject which engages the most constant attention of His Majesty’s Government, and His Majesty’s Embassy is convinced that, the Sublime Porte being likewise animated by a sincere desire to co-operate with it m endeavouring to remove all difficulties which tend to prejudice that commerce or to obstruct its legitimate expansion, which is to the common advantage of the two countries, it is only necessary to draw its attention to the existence o re evi m or ei to secure that its best efforts should be directed towards removing i , moie especia y since, in their opinion, the means of effecting at least a partia lemec y aie ac ua j 1 ^The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, which, m virtue of an Imperial Pirman granted in 1835 and the various Yiziena e ers su 7 , to them on various occasions by the Sublime Porte, are a presen , &amp; steamers with barges upon the river, have a reserve steamer m ^ ^ aommim Bussorah which would be instantly available for the purpose o copmg 'Fmbassv lation of cargo which is the source of complaint, and His n anmc 3 ^ Eoreimi is in receipt of instructions from His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State foi lorei^n [2315 x —1] ^ j . -B*Vr -- .—v- tT'' -Affairs to m-e upon the Sublime Porte that instructions should at once be transmitted to the authorities at Bussorah and Bagdad to permit the Company m question to utilize their reserve vessel in the same way as the two boats which they are at present runnino' for the purpose of relieving the congestion complained of.

I HAVE received your despatcli No. 776 of the 1st instant reporting, in reply to my’inquiry, that there is, in your opinion, hut little chance of a successful issue to any representations which might now he made to the Sublime Porte with a view to obtain permission for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to run a third steamer and barge between Bussorah and Bagdad. While fully appreciating the force of the arguments adduced by you against com pliance with the desire of the Company, I cannot but feel that the injury to British trade resulting from the excessive accumulation of goods at Bussorah is so serious as to call for an immediate attempt to remedy it, and that it affords at the same time a strong argument in favour of approaching the Porte on behalf of the Company with the request that they should receive permission, at all events temporarily, to run a third steamer and barge in that section of the river. You should accordingly decide, after consultation with Colonel Picot, the agent of the Company, who, as I understand, is now at Constantinople, what action on your part would have the best chance of attaining the object in view. It will rest with him to make use of such means as he possesses to influence the Palace in the desired sense, and eventually to secure permanency for the temporary permission which you may be able to obtain for the use of the steamer and barge. _ _ It is probable that the report which Mr. Weakley is to furnish on the condition of the custom-houses will show that much remains to be done in order to fulfil the condi tions laid down by us as necessary to our assent in the proposed increase of the Turkish customs duties. If this is so, you might point out to the Porte that, in ordei to relieve the situation at Bussorah, and as an alternative to proceeding immediately to an expendi ture of money on custom-house accommodation in that port, they could diminish congestion by giving the Company permission to use their third steamer, expedient should, however, be used with care lest the Ottoman Government should themselves put another steamer on the river, and subsequently invoke this measure as an argument against improving the defective custom-house accommodation. I transmit to you herewith copy of a letter on this subject from Mr. George Eloyd to Sir Charles Hardinge,* in which arguments of some force are brought forward m favour of action on the Company’s behalf. _ . j vu I understand that the Company are not unwilling to run their steamers under tne Turkish flag, a concession which should help towards inducing the Porte to grant the required permission.

CONFIDENTIAL. [42561] [December 19.] Section 1. Mr. Lloyd to Sir C. Hardinge.—[Received December 19.) Dear Sir Charles Hardinge, December 18, 1906. WITH reference to conversation respecting Tigris Euphrates Company’s steamers,, you wished me to put down on paper the ideas discussed. I suggested that, in view of the new organization of the Sennya Company on the Tigris, it was fairly clear that there was a strong intention in Constantinople to do all they could to get the British steamers off the river. That unless something were soon done it was increasingly probable that the intention would be successfully carried out. It is quite clear that the British Company can only stay on the river so long as there is profitable traffic to carry, and when their opponents are in possession of a considerably larger fleet and of all the good-will of the authorities, which latter pan very largely influence the traffic in favour of the Turkish Company by coercion, bribe, &amp;c., it seems very likely that the British Company will before very long find themselves in difficulties. I suggest that though the present time is not particularly auspicious for pressing a claim for a third steamer, yet it is unlikely that there will be a more auspicious time during the present reign ; on the contrary, short of entirely new influences at the Palace, the difficulties of getting a permission for a third steamer will only increase after the Turkish Company has got reorganized and more established on the river. I suggested that His Majesty’s Government should take the case up now, because (1) there is now an excellent grievance in the shape of a large accumulation of British goods lying on the quays at Bussorah which are suffering for want of transport; (2) because once the new steamers said to be ordered for the Turkish Company have arrived they would be able to deal with the traffic, and the opportunity to press for another British steamer might not easily reoccur ; and (3) because until the 3 per cent, is granted there exists always the possibility that the Government might make a sacrifice to please us, a sacrifice that they would regard as temporary, but whose duration would, like the barges, depend upon the amount of traffic there was to be dealt with and the future attitude of His Majesty’s Government on the question. I suggested that if His Majesty’s Government were really anxious that British interests on the Tigris should run no risk of being seriously weakened by unfair competition, and if they considered that a third steamer would really place Messrs. Lynch Brothers in a stronger position to fight against competition, if the matter were taken up strongly and in the right way there should at any rate be a fair chance of success. If His Majesty’s Government decided to press the point now before the feennya Company has become strong and in possession of any very large preponderance of traffic, a strong protest might be entered against the treatment of British goods on the Tigris, stating that His Majesty’s Government absolutely refuse to permit such an arbitrary restriction of British trade on the Tigris ; that they cannot permit that British goods shall be allowed to rot on the quays without some reason, when there is transport ready to hand in the shape of Messrs. Lynch’s steamer; and that His Majesty s Government ask for immediate permission for Messrs. Lynch to run a third steamer temporarily until the accumulation of traffic has been dealt with. I understand that Messrs. Lynch are prepared to pay a fair sum at the Palace for the temporary privilege, and a much larger sum for a permanent right. It would lie with Messrs. Lynch Brothers to negotiate with Izzet Pasha on a personal financial basis, probably on a monthly payment basis, with the prospect held out of a large sum when permanent permission had been granted. It would depend largely on the strength of His Majesty’s Government’s protest as to whether the backsheesh would have great effoct If, on the other hand, it is not considered a sufficiently good time to press for this permission, I suggested that it would at all events be of great value if a piotest were entered on the question, and that the Porte might be notified in so many words that His Majesty’s Government do not intend to see the British Company run off the river by any unequal competition, and that they cannot look favourably upon attempts [2260 /—l]to increase the competing Company without granting equal facilities to the British Company. At any rate, some protest of this sort might serve as a basis for action at some later time, when the question is fairly certain to come up again in an only more aggravated form. I venture to submit that any weakening of our present position on the Tigris means not only a weakening of our whole position in Mesopotamia, but a corresponding increase of German trade and activity ; and that they are only waiting to seize an opportunity is evident by their starting a line of steamers to the Persian Gulf, where they have at present practically no trade or interests. I suggested also that, in view of the river being one of the important lines of communication to Persian Gulf and India, it was wise to be careful that it should in no way fall from our grasp, and that our privileged position on the river was now becoming daily more valuable, in view of the approach of the Bagdad Railway, and in view of the fact that navigation may probably be the only communication from the railway head at Bagdad to Bussorah. It was probably in view of this fact, and not only in view of the general development schemes that the Civil List had in Mesopotamia that the Turkish steamers were about to be made into more formidable and up-to-date competitors against us.

AS we have had occasion to observe, the low rivers, Tigris and Euphrates, in the Province of Mesopotamia are navigable, but the produce of the villages and arable lands on the banks of those rivers is exported by means of rafts of a kind known as “keleks ” ; the amount of the export that can be effected in this way may be regarded as nothing compared with what might be exported under more favourable conditions, and owing to the existence of certain impediments to navigation the greater part of the produce of the district in question remains unexported. The country is thus deprived of the full benefit that ought to accrue from its abundant produce, and accordingly, with a view to facilitating the transport of goods, an Administration was formed under the name of Omani Osmani to improve the means of communication between Bussorah, Bagdad, and Meskene under the Eegis of the proper Ministry. As the steamers of the Administration in question were insufficient to cope with the traffic thus started, two new steamers were recently bought and the amount of business thereby increased ; and with a view to the clearing and deepening of the beds of the rivers, and in order that every effort might be made for the advancement of agriculture, it was decided to construct dams and open canals. A technical committee composed of engineers was formed and sent to make the requisite investigation and carry out the necessary measures, and a Report on the subject has been referred to the proper quarter, and the sums required for the carrying out of these operations and constructions have been set aside by the Departments concerned. According to information received, with a view to the reorganization of the Omani Osmani and its being put on a basis like that of the Shirketi Hamidie at Salonica, so that it may be attached to the Shirketi Khairie and carried on in accordance with the conditions that obtain in the case of that Company, a special Company is to be formed. In order to provide for such an extension of traffic as is likely to result from the operation of clearing and deepening the beds of the said rivers, and the measures shown to be requisite by the technical commission for the prevention of harm accruing from the overflow of the Shat-el-Arab are to be adopted as soon as possible, so that agriculture may be improved and that, at the period of the overflow, no harm may be done to the produce of the lands on the banks of the rivers. Thus navigation will be carried on by the steamers there on an extended scale as far as Meskene, and in older to bring about its extension to places below Meskene the necessary steps have been taken by the Ministry concerned. Accordingly, his Excellency Emin Pasha, commandant of a brigade, commander 01 the Vilayet of Bussorah and Chief of the Administration of the Omani Osmani, being well acquainted with the commercial needs and the conditions of navigation of those parts, has been selected by the Ministry of Marine, and a committee has been formed, consisting of the Shirketi Khairie and other persons, by whom the necessary investi gations are being made. Regulations have been drawn up with legald to the formation and scope of action of the new Company that is to be established, and also with regard [2260 c—2] [December 3.] Section 2. 140554] No. 1.

Its substance was that there are many ways of deriving benefit from the bounteous gifts of Providence conferred on the Province of Mesopotamia, and, as facility of means of communication is the very essence and soul of commerce and agriculture, vigorous efforts have been made to regulate the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates so as to increase the opportunities afforded by the bounty of Nature. According to information just received, a suitable steamer has been ordered from Armstrong’s factory, with the condition that it is to be ready in the spring. It will be a paddle steamer of 180 feet in length and of a speed of 12 miles an hour. Its price will be £ T. 20,800, it will have 205 tons displacement, and will be provided with electric light.

Sir, Constantinople, October 30, 1906. WITH reference to my despatch No. 618 of the 4th September, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah respecting German trade in the Persian Gulf and the Hamburg-American Company’s steam-ship service in the Persian Gulf. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 1. Consul Crow to Mr. G. Barclay. (No. 70. Confidential.) Sir, Bussorah, September 29, 1906. THE “ Canadia,” of the Hamburg-American Line, the first vessel of this line which has visited Bussorah, arrived in this port on the 5th September, and sailed for the bar to complete her cargo on the 18th September. She sailed from Hamburg on the 16th July with 240 cases of matches and 241 packages of general cargo, and took 220 bags of sugar and 850 packages of general cargo from Antwerp ; and 206 packages of general cargo from Marseilles, and a few details from Suez ; thus completing her full burden of 3,500 tons. Her general cargo consisted principally of glass, liquor, iron, chinaware, and wood. The “ Canadia ” took from Bussorah 1,300 tons of unhusked rice for Hamburg and Rotterdam, and about 1,600 tons of dates for tranship ment at Hamburg to New York, and sundries. She sailed with a full cargo. The “Canadia” will be followed by the “Sicilia,” which arrives shortly, and has, I hear, already booked a full return cargo. The service from Plamburg to Bussorah will be a monthly one, the vessels calling at Antwerp, Marseilles, Port Said, Suez, Port Soudan, Jibuti, Muscat (occasionally), Lingah, and Bushire. Outward freight is booked at present from 20s. to 22s. 6&lt;L per ton, and homeward freight at 17s. 6(7. per ton. The agent of the line at Bussorah is Mr. Robert Wouchhaus, who has resided in the Persian Gulf for the last fifteen years at Bushire, Bahrein, and Lingah. He speaks English fluently, and seems sanguine as regards the prospects of the new service. The following remarks, for which I am indebted to him, may be of interest: The Hamburg-American Line receives no subsidy from the German Government in any shape or form, although the general opinion in England is, I understand, to the contrary. The capital is exclusively German. The line is affiliated to no other. They formerly worked the mail services to the Far East in conjunction with the Nord Deutsche Lloyd, and received a postal subsidy for the operation. The connection!has,, however, been severed, and the Hamburg-American Line now works independently. They have a net tonnage of 840,000 tons register. By arrangement with British shipping Companies, or as a matter of expediency, it is proposed to leave the port of London severely alone, and not to interfere in any way with the British shipping interest, on condition that the British lines, as a quid pro quo, leave the northern ports to them. With this object in view, Mr. Wouchhaus assures me he has declined to quote any rates of freight for London cargo, and limits his operations to the Continental ports, and has given Bagdad merchants notice of this. Moreover, they do not touch at any port in India. He also informs me that his line refused an advantageous offer from an American firm to put a steamer on the direct date run to America this year, in order not to interfere with British shipping, and states that he merely takes dates for transhipment at Hamburg to New York. He says that the Hamburg-American [2223 c —2]_ ' A. &gt; ' u 7Line takes nothing away from the British lines, and that the field is large enough for them both. The freights secured enabled their Persian Gulf branch to work at a profit, and he characterized the high rates of freight demanded by the Anglo-Algerian, Bucknall and West Hartlepool combination as excessive and suicidal, and was of opinion that, if not reduced, they would give rise to competition in other quarters. I questioned Mr. Wouchhaus as to the probable effect of his line shipping Belgian A sugar from Antwerp at 20s. a-ton, while Messrs. Bucknall Bros., who have made a ' contract with the San Louis sugar refinery at Marseilles for two years, now ships Trench sugar at 35s. a-ton, and he said he saw no reason, under these conditions, why Belgian sugar should not supplant the French product in the Turkish-Arabian markets.

[2223 5 —I] ^ C CC ) l . . o *[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] amount of cargo is now lying at the port of Bussorah awaiting shipment to Bagdad. This Company has at present 3,500 tons of cargo stored in sheds and barges awaiting shipment. The two steamers and barges which the Company is at present permitted to run cannot deal adequately with the current traffic, and it will take months to forward this great accumulation of cargo. This means injury to British trade, delay in the realization of values, increased insurance, and a heavy responsibility on those liable for the safety of the goods. In fact there is an all-round loss to merchants and shippers. We therefore request His Majesty’s Government to make urgent representations to the Porte to allow us to run a third steamer and barge to enable us to deal with the accumulation of goods. Our local representatives advise us to suspend bookings. We think this would be had policy, and are loth to give effect to their advice. His Majesty’s Government is aware of the fact that the Hamidieh Administration added two new and powerful steamers to their service in 1904. The intention of the Administration of the Sultan’s Privy Purse to drive our steamers off the river is no secret. We are now informed that the said Administration have decided upon the ordering of two new steamers in Europe, and tenders have already been invited. We consider it all the more urgent, therefore, that our service should be strengthened whilst there is yet time, and whilst we can still complain of injury to British trade owing to the inadequacy of the river services. Our third steamer and barge are ready at Bussorah, and could deal with the surplus of cargo at the shortest notice. They could be made ready in 24 hours for regular work. It is surely a legitimate and proper request to make, namely, that we should be given the right to utilize immediately such transport as we have on the spot to carry forward this 0 great accumulation of British goods. It is pertinent to add that the Hamidieh steamer service is at present unable to forward their goods, and that they also have a considerable accumulation awaiting transit. We trust that His Majesty’s Government will vigorously take up the question. ASIATIC TURKEY. CONFIDENTIAL. [November 10.] Section 1. [37812] No. 1.

Mr. Crow offers some interesting remarks on this correspondence, but I think it is also worth noting that the letter of Messrs. Lynch’s agent clearly recognizes that there is ample and remunerative work for both Companies on the Tigris; and the fact that his Company have not thought it necessary to lower their cargo rates to the charges made by the Hamidieh Administration may be taken as a sure proof that Messrs. Lynch’s steamers have quite as much of the carrying trade as they can conveniently handle, and that the competition of the Turkish steam-boats is not sufficiently severe to affect their profits.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith, inclosed to your Excellency, copies of letters received from Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and Captain Denne, of the Turkish steamer “ Hamidieh,” with reference to the competition between the two Tigris River ( ^O TT 1 D£LTT -1 OS Transport on the river is less congested than formerly. Messrs. Lynch Brothers state that there is less cargo to carry, while, from Captain Denne’s letter, it would apnear that the Turkish line secures the bulk of the direct caigo fiom home and Lynch’s Company that forwarded in transit via Bombay. The “ Hamidieh’s ” engines have lately broken down, and the vessel is laid up temporarily. I am informed that the Turks are at a loss how to icpaii them, as the English engineers have left. I have no further information regarding the purchase by^the Turks of vessels in Belgium, beyond the statements in the inclosed letters. Messrs. Lynch Brothers suffer considerable annoyance from the arbitrary proceedings of the Hamidieh Administration’s servants in river matters. I have brought instances ol the bad behaviour of the latter to the Yali’s notice, and have asked him to caution the Manager. I am, however, as yet unable to say whether my representations have had the desired effect. I think—at present, at all events—that Messrs. Lynch Brothers are more likely to suffer from the bad handling of the Turkish vessels than from the effects of any genuine competition in the carrying trade of the river; but the “Hamidieh” undoubtedly takes a large proportion of the through caigo to Bagdad. 1 n I have, &amp;c. (Signed) E. E. CROW. [1900 cc—2] I 1•2 Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Mr. S. Dods to Consul Crow. (Private and Confidential.) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company I)ear Mr. Crow, Bussorah, February 16, 1906. WITH regard to your request for confidential information about the Hamidieh i/ Steam-boat Administration. The competition experienced by our Company during 1905 has been very keen especially for the native passenger traffic. The increase of their fleet by the steamers “ Hamidieh ” and “ Burhanieh ” should have enabled them to deal with double the amount of cargo they were formerlv able to carry. However, the expectations about the performance of these steamers has not been fulfilled. They are faulty in design, and inferior material has been used in their construction, consequently they are frequently breaking down. Both these steamers have been dispatched from Bussorah either a day or a few hours, as occasion demanded, ahead of our steamers in order to attract the native passengers. Cargo rates have been reduced by them to 2s. 6d. lower than our Companv’s. Our figures for through cargo (i.e., booked in Europe) from Bussorah to Bagdad are at present 32s. 6d. per ton for general cargo, and 30s. per ton for sugar. It is reported that the Hamidieh Steam-boat Administration have purchased two new steamers from Messrs. Cockerill and Co., of Belgium, and we presume the Turks will take due care that the faults which have come to light in the “ Harnidieli ” and “ Burhaniehwill not be again repeated. When these steamers commence running, the competition will no doubt be even keener than it now is. May I draw your attention to the following incidents, which only too plainly illustrate the risks encountered by our steamers when meeting the Turkish steamers while under weigh. While lying at anchor at Bussorah on the night of the 29th April last, our steam launches “Ishtar” and “Asp” were damaged to the extent of over 2001, and our steamer “ Blosse Lynch” at the same time was nearly run down by the Hamidieh Steam-boat Administration Company’s steamer “ Bessafah.” On the 29th December their steamer “ Mosoul ” ran into and sank the barge of the “ Bagdad ” while they were stopped alongside the bank near Khalet-Saleh. Since the “Bessafah” collided with the “Khalifah” in December 1902, our steamers stop and keep as near the bank as possible when they meet the Turkish steamers. In connection with the damage sustained by our launches, Lloyd’s agents were requested by the underwriters to prosecute the Hamidieh Steam-boat Administration, but they replied and informed the underwriters that to do so would only be throwing money away. The “ Hamidieh ” and “ Burhanieh ” are officered by natives (with the exception of one European) who have no professional training, and with two more powerful Turkish steamers on the river, also being run by incompetent officers, the risk of accident by collision to our steamers will be greater than before. I would also beg to remind you that it is now four years our Company has been defending the “ Khalifah Bessafah ” case, where a sum of £ T. 16,780 is claimed. The fact that the Turkish Government are the prosecutors debars our Company from obtaining justice, and the poor consolation we have to accept is that we can appeal against the inevitable adverse verdict and carry the case to Constantinople, which will entail additional heavy expenses. If the object of the lurks is to demonstrate the impossibility of our Company obtaining redress for accidents caused by those in command of their steamers they have every reason to be satisfied with their tactics. Yours very truly, (Signed) SAML. DODDS. (3 , -7 tf Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Captain Denne to Consul Crow. Pear Mr. Crow, “ Hamidieh,” at Bussorah, February 2, 1906. I AM sorry, I liad so much to do during my stay here last voyage, that your note entirely escaped my memory. I do not know that there is much to say about our steamers. There are always two sent from Bussorah to Bagdad every week, and they seem to he paying very well indeed. ' I think we have the larger proportion of cargo from home. The transhipment caro*o via Bombay is, I think, mostly handled by Lynch’s boats. We get most of the deck passengers, and Lynch, partly owing to their arrangement with the British India, carry nearly all the European passengers. Two more boats are to be built in Belgium, I believe, but I cannot say when they are to be delivered. Probably at the end of this year. There is very great need on this river of a Conservancy Department for the removal of wrecks, &amp;c., and a few lights would not do any harm; but I do not suppose the amount of British shipping at present up here would justify you in raising the question if you felt disposed to. There seems an idea amongst the unthinking part of the population that I am bribed by Lynch to run my steamer detrimental to the interests of the Senea. It is, of course, ridiculous; and as a matter of fact the “Hamidieh” runs much more regularly and with less accidents, &amp;c., than the “ Burhanieh,” which is commanded bv a Turkish marine officer. Lynch’s steamers have run like clocks during the last year, and I much fear that our two new steamers, although they are perhaps faster, cannot become such a well- conducted concern as Lynch Company. The deck passengers travel by our steamers principally on account of the fare being generally less. There was an accident the other day which resulted in the sinking of one of our car»’o barges. The cargo was salved, but the barge is a total wreck. ° I do not think there is anything more to say, and this is very little. Yours truly, (Signed) (I. H. A.

The general lines on which you have drawn up the Concession ha£/my approval, and I have to con firm telegram sent you to-day as under 'Your letter nlneteenthapprove general lines petition but certain important amplifications essen tlal writing fully to-day% C. A. Theodoridi Esq., Lloyd Han, Constantinople. butbut to make the position clearer I have had to make a few slight verbal alterations, which, you will ob serve, do not alter the spirit or intention of your draft as I understand it. 1 now enclose a draft showing the required al terations which please have inserted in your peti tion. The power in my hands of appointing 'Managing Agents' at Busreh &amp;/ or Baghdad (the term 'Managing Director' is not a suitable one) of course carries with it the payment of their remuneration as men tioned in Article IX. You will observe I have merely inserted the commission to be paid for such services so as to avoid all misunderstanding hereafter. I may add that it is considerably less than what is paid by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company or any similar Company. As regards the 10^ net earnings to come to the Lessees my idea is that should go to you or your nominees and the remaining 1% to myself or my nom ineesnominees lor arranging and providing the Loan, and I shall he glad to hear that this is satisfactory to you. I have endeavoured to make as few changes in your draft as possible, hut you will understand the necessity in raising so large a sum amongst my friends of satisfying them that their subscriptions are properly protected, for this reason when the transaction is finally concluded it will be neces sary for a formal legal agreement to be drawn up setting out all particulars in full detail, and a further document will have to be given by you renounc ing your rights as Lessee to those providing the Loan in consideration of your receiving the above annual commission during the currency of the Lease, but the present rough agreement sufficiently sets out, I think, the general understanding now come to between us and the lines on which the more formal document will be based. An important detail I would wish you to protect us against is the taking over of the two ne steam-steamers^ which, I understand, have proved quite un suitable for the service, and which I presume the Commissi on of Imperial Domains have not taken over and are claiming upon the builders for nonfulfilment of contract. These steamers, as you are aware, would form the most important item in the Lease of property to be handed over. As regards your letter of 20th. Article III. I see no necessity for the addi tional words you propose as they are fully provided in other clauses. Article VIII. I have inserted words which fully meet this point. Article X. I regret it is impossible to accept the suggestion of your Palace friends that the 10^ on net earnings payable to the Lessees under Article 10 be altered to 10^ on gross earnings, the differ ence between gross and net to be paid to them. But you can arrange for any remuneration they require to come out of the payable to the Civil List. You can doubtless arrange with them for the reduction ofof the 90^ to BO^o or 70%, as may be agreed upon, and the difference can be added to our 10^ to be after wards refunded by us to you and your Palace friends. As regards the agreement for the proposed Loan, your draft correctly details the principal points with exception of the clause as to disposal of net profits, and will form the basis of the formal con tract to be drawn up when the negotiations are com pleted . All stamps, registration fees, and charges in connection with the Loan will, of course, be paid out of it. ! am he., (Signed) George S.

My Lord:- With reference to my despatch No.4.19 of the 16th of June last, relative to the competition between the steamers of the Hamidieh Administration and those of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company, I have the honour to transmit, herewith to Your Lordship copy of a despatch, which I have received from His Majesty’s Consul at Basra in reply to my request that he should make confidential en quiries from the leading British Commercial and Shipping firms at Basra with a view to obtaining full information as to the effect the reorganization of the Hamidieh Administration has had on British trade in general. Your Lordship will observe that the conch&gt; sions which Mr.Crow draws from the enquiries he has made in different quarters are to the effect that the reorganization of the Turkish Company and the competition The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.competition which has thereby been created with Messrs Lynch's steamers and the ensuing decrease oX the river freights for through cargo have so far proved beneficial rather than otherwise to the in terests of British trade generally. I have &amp;c . y (Signed) N. R. O'Conor.copy. No .54. Confidential. BRITISH CONSULATE, BASRA. August 21st, 1905. Sir: - In reply to Your Excellency’s despatch of July 18th last Confidential, with reference to the re organization of the Hamidieh Company, I have the honour to report as follows: The management of the Turkish river steamers changed hands in March 1904, when the Oman Ottoman Administration was abolished and the line was re organized under the style of the 'Hamidieh Steamship Administration'. They took over four steamers, the 'Prat', the 'Bagdadi', the 'Mosul” and the 'Resafa', and barges and added two new steamers, the 'Hamidieh' and the 'Burhanieh' and 4 barges. The 'Hamidieh' ran at intervals from August 2nd 1904 to April 7th 1905 and made 13 voyages. The 'Burhanieh' ran from September 7th 1904 to April 7th 1905 and made 10 voyages His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir N.R.O*Conor, G.C.B. &amp;C. , cSgC . , &amp;C .voyages. These journeys were experimental. Some were made on light draught, almost empty, others with a small quantity of cargo. Alterations were frequently made in the con struction of the vessels and their machinery. As trials they served to test the speed of the steamers and their draught capacity hut they afford no idea of commercial results or of general effects on the carrying trade of the river. The new steamers were definitely taken over on July 28th 1905. They began to run again on July 29th and have made one round voyage each. Previous to the reorganization of the Turkish Administration in March 1904, the rate o± freights quoted in London by the Oman Ottoman Line for through cargo from Basra to Bagdad, that is, for river s freight only, was 35/- per ton. Lynch 1 s rate then stood at 37/&lt;3 per ton and 35/- for sugar. The rate for through cargo from Bombay and Persian Gulf ports, river freight only, was Rupees 30 per ton weignt 01 measurement. After the reorganization ine Turxish raterate was reduced to 33/- per ton, where it stands at present, and Lynch's rate was reduced on March 1st s d s 1905 to 32/6 per ton weight or measurement and 30/- for sugar. The rate for through cargo from Bombay and the Persian Gulf ports was reduced on May 15th 1905 to 25 Rupees. Most of the continental cargo is transhipped at Bombay. The choice of river steamers is left to the option of shippers. In 1904 trade was bad, there was cholera and the exchange was unfavour able. Moreover Bagdad merchants were overstocked. The reduction in the rates for freight therefore can not be altogether attributed to the competition on the river which indeed had hardly begun. The fact, however, remains that river freights for the through cargo from London, Marseilles and Egypt have fallen 5/- per ton and there from Bombay and the Persian Gulf ports 5 rupees, and it is possible that the presence of the new Turkish steamers may tend to keep them where they are or may even reduce them further. This result is, as far as it goes, benefi cial to British Commerce in general. Lo cal /Local ratas for freight fluctuate according to tne space available on the steamers. A native mer- oiianWao is anxious to forward his goods at once^ may pay double or more the ordinary through cargo cate. There is no fixed standard. Lynch*s steamers can carry 340 to 400 tons a voyage when the river is high and about 230 tons a voyage in the low sea son. Local rates fluctuate accordingly. They are not a faithful indication of the competition. Tile attempts of the Turkish river steamers to monopolise the native passenger traffic have been partially successful and the results during the past year have been prejudicial to the British firm. It is generally admitted that local influence is brought to bear to induce native passengers to travel by the Sultan’s steamers. Until we see how the new line is worked it would be premature to form any opinion as to the ultimate effect it may have on British commerce in general. But, river steamers being now more numerous than before, transport facilities have increased and thethe outlook, in the opinion of British merchants here, is favourable for the development of our trade. Freights have fallen 5/- a ton, and although this is not mainly the result of the competition, the exis tence of competition may prevent them from rising again* It Is unlikely that the increased facilities will lead to any immediate expansion of the import trade, as this Is chiefly a question of supply and demand, but they may exercise some influence on the export of grain. Perhaps the native sailing craft, which now convey it, may eventually give way to the steamers. It is doubtful, as the 'Lefinehs' can always carry grain at a cheaper rate than that at which it would pay steamers to do so. The minimum rate of freight to secure a profit for steamers is 2 paras an oke and the sailing craft can do it cheaper than that. But, if it should occur, the grain export trade would derive considerable benefit and there might be large developments in which Brit ish merchants engaged in the trade would parcicipate If the Turkish line is run well and fairly, our tradetrade is not likely to suffer. On the contrary, we may look for favourable results. But if, on the other hand, they try to exercise a monopoly and sue- ceed in driving the Tigris and Euphrates Steamship Company off the river, freight will undoubtedly rise with adverse results to us. I see no signs of any combination between the two Companies to keep freights here. Such a contingency is, I think, very unlikely. I have &amp;c., (Signed) P. E.

The Burhanieh attained a speed of 10.15 knots per hour hut she was 1.85 knots and the Hamidieh 3 knots below the contract speed of 12 knots. Neither of the vessels can carry more than 190 tons of cargo out of the 230 tons stipulated in the agreement on a 4*5' draft. The Turks declare they only take 161 tons each. They are both too heavy and too stiff and burn nearly twice the quan tity of coal consumed on Messrs Lynch's boats. The steamers have so far only been run tentatively by special arrangement between the purchasers and the builders and have now been laid up until the Turks decide His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir N.R.O'Conor. G.C.B.decide what course to pursue. During the time they have “been run on the river freights to Bagdad have fallen from 37/6 to 32/6 per ton these figures inc3.ude 2/6 per ton transhipping charges), hut I am informed that the fall in rates is due to scarcity of cargo and not to the competi tion of the new Turkish steamers. By the suspension of these two vessels the quantity of cargo which it has been possible to for ward will be reduced by about 365 tons per week. I have c%c.. (Signed) F.E.Crow.No. 24. Very Confidential. Sir BASK A, 18th 1905, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of 1 Your Excellency's despatch of March 31st. From in formation received from the Hamidieh Company, it would appear that they contemplate purchasing two new harges to replace those taken over from the Oman Line, which are now hardly serviceable. Messrs. Ritchie, Graham, 5 . and Milne's representative, who put the new steamers together and who is still employed here in superin tending alterations has been instructed to design them. It seems probable that they will be purchas ed in Germany. Sassoon Effendi, the Managing Direc tor of the Hamidieh Company has applied for leave of absence. He will proceed to England via Const an oi nople and Germany. He proposes to negotiate for the purchase of the barges on his way. He also wants to open agencies for the Hamidieh Company in London and Manchester. The Company has hitherto been represent- )h ; ■■represented in London 'by Messrs Btrick nnd Company. It will de the care of these agencies not only to ex tend the connection of their line among English s..dp- ping firms, for the purpose of increasing their car rying trade up the river, but also to superintend the purchase of stores for their vessels, on vmich considerable sums are spent yearly in England. I am unable to ascertain whether tnis new deparcure is Sassoon Effendi 1 s own idea, or whether it origi *n k-o. at Constantinople. The managing director has • business relations himself in England. With reference to any attempt on the part of the local authorities to restrict the free carrying trade of our steamers, I have so far received no complaints Messrs Lynch Brother s'Agent, whom I have questioned on the subject, tells me that nothing which would amount to interference with their ccarrying trade has yet oc curred. I gather that he suspects obstruction but has no proof on which to base a complaint. He will inform me if anything of this nature arises. SinceSince waiting the above I have (May 19th) receiv ed Your Excellency's telegram of May 18th, about the reported detention of 250 passengers in quarantine until Lynch's boat had left. I had received no pre~ vious information on the subject nor had any report of the occurrence reached my office. On receipt of your telegram I communicated with Lynch's agent and have now received a letter from him which I send in original, giving some account of the matter.' It is possible that the so-called 'brokers” referred to in Mr. Dod's letter were interested in delaying the departure of the passengers. I have no proof that they were employed by the Hamidieh Company to do so, but I believe that a great deal of 'touting' is done to secure goods and passengers for the Turkish steam ers and that 'brokers' get a bonus of four piastres a head for every person they bring. It would be quite possible for the 'brokers' to prevent passengers leaving quarantine by merely neglecting to send boats to convey them. It has not been suggested to■Mi me tliat the Local authorities interfered in one matter or were in any \my responsible for the de lay and it is not the business of the quarantine officials to see that persons in quarantine are provided with means of leaving the island, when their period -of detention is over. At the same time there is nothing to prevent Lynch Brothers from sending a 'tout' to quarantine island to secure passengers or from assisting them in leaving, in time to catch their steamers.Copy. Lynch Brothers. Private. Dear Mr. Grow:- BASRA, fey 19th 1905. The 'Mejidieh' should have left Basra on April 1st at noon hut having ascertained verbally from tne Quarantine Authorities that 250 native passengers were leaving the Quarantine Island at 1 p.m. I de tained the 'Mejidieh” until 2 p.m. in order to secure these passengers for her. There being no signs of the passengers leav ing Quarantine at 2 p.m. I kept the steamer another hour and then had to let her depart without a single passenger from the Quarantine Island who had completed their Quarantine at 1 p.m. (according to the author ities* own information) on that day. I had several visits from socalled Brokers who do business with the Hamidieh Steamers, on the morning of April 1st. Their enquiries were first about the time of departure of our steamers: they were referred to the advertised time of sailing, viz: noon, as I had an inkling Of what they wanted.I) * Tliey cX^ain returned to discuss terms to 'oring tne passengers then in Quarantine to our steamer. As cur iirm nave never had to employ 'brokers or touts hitherto to bring passengers, this move on their part did not result in business. I may mention that the 'Hamidieh' left the pre vious day (March 31st) and consequently the Turks had no soearner on ohe oertn so they had everything to £&gt;ain and nooning to risk by tne passengers remaining in Quarantine until our steamer left. These passengers left by the Turkish steamer 'Burbanieh' the following Friday i.e. April 7th.

The item’s principal correspondents are: representatives of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (hereafter ETSNC, chiefly the Company Secretary, H W Maclean), the Director of the ETSNC (Henry Finnis Blosse Lynch); the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey); the Private Secretary to Sir Edward Grey (Louis Du Pan Mallet); the British Ambassador at Constantinople [Istanbul] (Sir Gerard Augustus Lowther); the Political Resident for Turkish Arabia (Captain John Gordon Lorimer).The majority of the correspondence is dated 1909 to 1910, and focuses on the controversial nature of the proposed merger of the two steamship operators, which bore more of the character of a takeover by the British concern of its Turkish counterpart. While many Turkish commentators understood the prospect of a likely British monopoly of navigation rights on the Tigris and Euphrates in Irak [Iraq], the British Government feared having their commercial activities in Iraq diminished, possibly to the advantage of competing German commercial interests. The controversy, which acquired the sobriquet the ‘Affaire Lynch’ in the British press, precipitated a local popular uprising in Iraq, and in part led to the resignation of the Grand Vizier Hüseyin Hilmi Pasha, who had supported the merger, in December 1909. The correspondence is thus split between the contractual negotiations over the navigation concession, and the political consequences of its controversy, including cuttings of articles published in the press in Britain (
                           The Times,
                           The Morning Post) and copies of articles published in Ottoman Turkey (
