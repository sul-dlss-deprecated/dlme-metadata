'Hie Council of Ministers met and considered the proposal signed by the majority of Deputies which the Chamber decided to refer to the Government and which was forwarded to the office of the Prime Minister by the President of the Chamber of Deputies under his letter No. 69 dated the 12th November, 1942. The Council also considered a memorandum submitted by the Prime Minister No. 125 dated llth January, 1943. In view of the hostde attitude which has been adopted for a long time by the Axis Powers against Iraq and of the continued activities through their agents for the destruction of the legitimate Iraqi Govern ment and of the pressure brought to bear on the Iraq Parliament (as revealed in the Parliamentary Resolution adopted by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate on llth November, 1941, and 15th November. 1941 respectively) and in view of the openly hostile action taken by them during May, 1941. And in view of the persistence of the Axis Powers in their hostile attitude from then to the present time by the attacks directed against Iraq and her interests through their broadcasting stations; and in view of their continued efforts to create differences and dissensions between the various communities of Iraq, with the object of endangering public security and public order by spreading false rumours and lying news through their Broadcasting Stations as well as by all other means avail able to them. And in view of the fact that the Broadcasting authorities of the Axis Powers openly and unceasingly use abusive expressions which are intended to impair the dignity of the Royal Family and so undermine the loyalty of the Iraqi people; and also in view of the fact that the Axis Powers encouraged those persons who defied the law and attemp ted to overthrow' the Constitutional System of their country by force of arms and have, after the escape of these persons from Iraq, harboured and maintained them. And whereas the interests of Iraq in particular and of the Arab peoples in general make it imperative that Iraq should adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations signed at Washington on 2nd Januarv, 1942, which was based on the Atlantic Charter signed by the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the 14th of August, 1941, and this in view of the lofty principles embodied in the said document, guaranteeing to all peoples, small or great, their liberties and independence, as well as their integrity. After the perusal of Article 26 (8) of the Organic Law 7 , the Council passed the following resolution: — (i) Iraq shall be deemed to be in a state of war with the three Axis Powers. (ii) Iraq shall adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations signed at Washington on January 2nd, 1942,2 MENORANDUM SUBMITTED BY H. E. THE PRIME MINISTER, No. 125 DATED 11-1-1943 1. The principal foundations upon which any democratic state should stand may he outlined as follows:— (a) A definite system of government determining the basic institutions and powers ot the state concerned and ensuring her progress towards the realisation of her own ideals, the establishment of justice therein and the development of her vital resources in the political, administrative, constructive, economic, social and other fields, Such a system is usually ensured by an organic law which stipulates that the conduct of the affairs of the state shall be under the supervision of a parliament whose designation and composition vary with different states. (A) A head whom the people entrust with the supreme leader ship of the country and who is invested with powers enabling him to direct the policy of the state and control the proper functioning of the machine thereof in accordance with its constitution and the laws derived therefrom. (c) A force composed of all the various armed services to safe guard the integrity of the state and defend the country against any internal or external menaces. In the present age such a force is, as a general rule, supported by international re lations which ensure the safety of the state and which are reinforced by treaties and pacts whereby the state is linked with certain other sta es to whom it is drawn closer by com mon interests and conformity of aims. Recently, such international relationship has become very important not only in the case of small and new’ states, but also in the case of great powers no matter how large and powerful they may be, such as the allied and the axis powers which hive been interre ated with a network of treaties all of whichaim at safeguarding the existence and ensuring the safety and interest of the state concerned. One must look forward to the gradual expansion of these international relationships as, owing to the increased complexity and development of inter national interests due to modern inventions it is quite impossible for any single state to live isolated from the rest of the world. Any impairment in the above foundations in any state will inevitably threaten the very existence of that ftate and harm her in proportion to the extent tf the defect 2. If the modern history of Iraq is carefully examined it will appear that the young Iraqi state was only founded after the last Great war, ie the war of 1914—1918. Iraq at once commenced to consoli date gradually her three foundations, beginning with entiusting the sovereignty of the nation into the hands of the late King Faisal, I, the founder of modern Iraq and restorer of her ancient glory. Then followed the enactment of her organic law, the raising of her r.rmed forces, the delimitation of her frontiers, the conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Great .Britain whose interests coincided with the independence of Iraq, and finally her admission to the League of Nations and adherence to the covenant thereof.*0 &amp; t • # For her existence and stability during that period, Iraq was only indebted next to God, to the efforts of tier sincere sons, to the Great House of Hashim and to the British Government who deemed it to be in her own interest to support the wishes of the people ot Iraq, As a matter of fact not one of all the great and small countries of the world, including those who call themselves now the Axis Powers, agreed to recognize the independence of Iraq except only through the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty which was approved and welcomed by all Arab Countries. Even the leading personalities of Egypt, foremost among them the Egyptian Wafd Party, were unanimous in recommemling the conclusion of a treaty of alliance by Egypt with Great Britain on the same lines 3. It is exremely regrettable that, soon after the 'Iraqi State had been founded and stabilized, fate should make her suffer the tragic loss of her great leader and founder King Faisal the First, just at the beginning of her new life. Eventually, she had to face many difficulties and was threatened with innumerable dangers, whereby elements of weakness crept into her constitution. As soon as the policy of aggression began to assert itself a few years ago by the acts of certain ambitious states, the representatives of some of those powers were allowed to seize every opportunity for aggravating that state of weakness in ‘Iraq by getting into touch with certain evil elements in the country such as selfish and adventurous persons and encouraging their dangerous activities. The result was that the wicked intentions of those powers towards ‘Iraq, in particular, and the Arab Countries, in general, were proved beyond all doubt in spite of their pretended sympathy for the Arab cause as expressed through their proteges, mouthpieces and sycophants In this way those powers were able to take advantage of certain weiknesses in Iraq, to encourage the agents of destruction and to widen the sphere of their action, thus striking heavy blows against the very basis of the three foundations upon which she rests. If, in fact, the agents, who have placed themselves at the disposal of those foreign powers who are eager to devour their country, were asked to state what made them ■ erve those powers, they would be unable to justify their shameful conduct which most dangerously thieatened the very existence and vital interests of their country. 4. Even before the present war certain aggressive powers began to carry out their abominable policy by resorting to force and invaded some countries with their armed forces, The extent of their aggression steadily increased and finally led to a declaration of war between the Axis Powers, on the one side, and Great Britain and her Allies, on the other. The war has since so spread that it has attained its present degree of magnitude. The right policy that should have been adopted by all states,— particularly those that are small and recently created—was to denounce and resist any aggressive policy pursued by any bullying power. Had all the states of the world combined, before the outbreak of the present war. and agreed that each one would join in opposing any armed aggression even if the state attacked was a distant one unconnected with them by special ties or interests, we should not have recently witnessed one state after another losing their independence and becoming victims of aggression, with all the sufferings and evils4 entailed thereby, Events have proved that to be indifferent to aggression is to encourage it and to allow it to expand and spr ead until in time it attains its climax. The Axis Powers who did so much harm to Iraq by encou raging and nourishing the elements of weakness therein have gradually put into execution their aggressive plans and have succeeded in widening the scope of their plans so that a large number of countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland. Yugoslavia, Greece, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Siam and even some parts of China, Russia and the possessions of the United States are now groaning under the oppressive yoke of Axis occupation. There is clear evidence of the threat of an early extension of armed aggression to other States and countries at tlie first opportunity, and among those threatened are the ‘Iraq state and other Arab countries where the Axis Powers have indul ged in secret intrigue and open propaganda for some years past. Undoubtedly most of the loyal leaders in those countries now regret their failure to resist the policy of aggression in its initial stages and realise the folly of their once cherished belief that they could save their countries from aggression by being indifferent to the aggres sive acts which, as onlookers, they saw being committed in detail against other states. Had all the victims adopted at the outset the wise policy of promptly opposing each act of aggression as it occurred, each country contributing to the full extent of her capacity, the outlook of the present world war would have now been quite a different one, and perhaps, the leaders in and promoters of this aggressive policv would not even have ventured to carry it into final effect 5. The policy of armed aggression met with great success at the beginning of the war and brought destruction to all the countries which ^he powers of evil were able to enter. In 1940 the Axis victories attained their zenith materially and threatened the whole world with the evils of subjugation and destruction. The policy of treachery and destruction adopted by the Axis Powers caused a shock of terror and anxiety unprecedented in the annals of history. The world then turned towards heaven searching for a ray of hope to enlighten the dark future. During those hard times and before the United States entered the war. Mr, Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt met and announced on the 14th of August 1941, the “ Atlantic Charter” by which they expressed the common principles underlining the policy of their respective countries for the guarantee of a happy future when peace, cooperation and confidence would replace doubt, suspicion and rivalry amongst the peoples of the world. The Charter consists of eight articles, of which the second and third ones specially concern us. They read :— Second : They desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. Third : Thev respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live, and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.5 These two articles enlighten the path along which the Arab Cause is advancing. They contain the cures for its complications and sound principles for the solution of its problems, as well as the means for the attainment oi its ideals. Undoubtedly, these principles will continue to prevail as the American people has unanimously decided to take part in world affairs under Mr. Roosevelt’s leadership for the benefit of the American people itself, as well as for the whole world. The most important factor in shattering the belief of men in international justice and shaking the spirit of mutual confidence among nations after the last world war was undoubtedly the withdrawal of the Government of the United States of America from participation in the field of European Politics and their refusul to support the ideals which they had themselves promulgated and promised to ensure. This negative attitude of the American Government gave a free land to the other victorious states, who were bound to one another by pledges from which it was not easy for them to disengage themselves. 1 his led to a number of difficulties and serious consequences of which unfortunately some of the Arab Countries had a share. 1 he return of the United States of America to the policy of pai ticipation in world politics will help to remove many of the difficulties that may arise from previous international pledges, especially any secret ones and will ensure international justice according to the provisions of the Atlanbc Charter. It is most unlikely that the Government of' the United States of America will abstain from associating herself with general international affairs at the end of the present war. for they have al [ ea ?L VV i it n e l Sed with their own eyes the misfortunes and calamities which befell the world as a result of their non-interference in world affairs after the last war, as well as the horrors and sufferings of the present struggle which surpass anything that occurred during any previous war. u tlie aggravation of the Axis aggression and the entry of the United States of America in the war. the leaders of twenty-six states representing the inhabitants of more than two-thirds of the whole civilized world met and signed in Washington the Twenty-Six Powers Pact (Commonly known as the Declaration of the United Nations) which confirms the principles embodied in the Atlantic Charter and which aims at defeating the policy of aggression. In this declaration they have left the door open for all other nations who may or will help or contribute materially in the common struggle to join with them. 7. It is evident that it is in the vital interests of Iraq (being a state bound by the Anglo - Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, as well as by the Covenant oi the league of Nations, and one who carries out her in ternational obligations with all candour and sincerity) to support any policy which tenets to ensure the freedom of peoples and resist aggress ion, especially when it is realized that in the fore-front of the states which back this policy stands the country which has already proved by net actions, her friendly attitude to Iraq and shown that her interests do accord with Iraq’s independence. On the other hand, the end of the states who follow the policy of aggression in this respect has always been to obliterate the political existence of Iraq and encourage' every movement started by Iraq’s enemies in and out of this countryIt was the duty of Irac, to stand by the side of A1 ‘y p reat d .t : n and lier Allies ever since the declaration of this war. But she was unable to do so as she was engaged in fighting Axis intrigues in he. own country. the most obvious proof of the wicked intentions of , x •. fhpv have don- 3 and are still doing in spie.iaing false^uniou^t'^on^t^h^country^ind against the noble'House of Hashim and to abusing every person who may be legnb- tins Treaty of Alliance. .... intentions of the Axis were most evident dining the disgraceful'ebelUou o, Powers'dtdfhe'b Provide arms and funds ^iejtders of ra^r Itch m^edSes,rot edl^ try and imperif.ed its very existence. . leve lled only too clearly the real interest of their Government tnthe udato of Iraq when^Key whaT- produce°or1toodf tliey could lay their hands on. and they sent large quantities to their countries.

Moreover, such adherence will greatly assist Iraq to attain her national objectives and realise her ideals in her internal, as well as external policies. These policies have been announced on several occasions and have in view the welfare of Iraq and that of the Arab countries which are struggling to obtain their freedom and independence. Moreover, the liabilities to be borne by this country as a result of the adherence to the above Declaration are, under no circumstances, expected to be other than thos e to which she has pledged herself under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and th e Covenant of the League of Nations. *8 OFFICIAL STATEMENT. In vie of the hostile attitude which has been adopted for a long time by the Axis Powers against Iraq and of the continued activities through their agents for the destruction of the legitimate Iraqi Government and of the pressure brought to bear on the Iraq Parliament (as revealed in the Parliamentary Resolution adopted by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate on 11th November, 1941, and 15th November, 1941, respectively) and in view of the openly hostile action taken by them during May, 1941. And in view of the persistence of the Axis Powers in their hostile attitude from then to the present time by the attacks directed against Iraq and her interests through their Broadcasting Stations; and in view of their continued efforts to create differences and dissensions between the var ious communities of Iraq, with the object of endangering public secu rity and public order by spreading false rumours and lying news through their Broadcasting Stations as well as by all other means available to them. And in view of the fact that the Broadcasting authorities of the Axis Powers openly and unceasingly use abusive expressions which are intended to impair the dignity of the Royal Family and so undermine the loyalty of the Iraqi people; and also in view of the fact that the Axis Po wers encouraged those persons who defied the law and attempted to over throw the Constitutional System of their country by force of arms and have, after the escape of these persons from Iraq, harboured and main tained them. In view of what is stated above and pursuant to Article 26 (8) of the organic Law, His Highness the Regent has issued Royal Irada (Decree) No. 29 dated 13th January, 1943 , declaring a state of war be tween Iraq and the Axis Powers as from midnight of 16-17 January,1943.13 ATLANTIC CHARTER. The President of the United States and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world. First, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other. Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them. Fourth, they will endeavour, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access on equal terms to trade and to the raw mate rials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity. Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing for all improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security. Sixth, after the final destruction of Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwell ing in safety within their own boundaries and which will afford assur ance that all men in all lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want. Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high i seas and oceans without hindrance. Eighth, they believe that all nations of the world for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of f force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten or may threaten aggression outside their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace- loving peoples the crushing burden of armament.PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY THIRTY-TWO DEPUTIES AT THE MEETING HELD BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ON 12TH NOVEMBER, 1942. His Excellency, The Presiden/ of the Chamber of Deputies. The Speech from the Throne has explicitly alluded to the aims and wishes of the Arab Countries for freedom and independence.
