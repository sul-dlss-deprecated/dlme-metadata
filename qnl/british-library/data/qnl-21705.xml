C.J.Felly, Esq., The Agency, Bahrain. bhl/ear' a,® COPY Translation of letter No 67/5 dated 15th November 1947 from the Representative to H. E. the Ruler of Qatar to Fields Manager, Dukhan. After Greetings, I would like to draw your attention to a letter received from the Director of Customs at Zekrit, in which he states that A.O.D’Souza an Indian.has brought with him a statuette to worship. If this were true, we do not admit or agree to it, as H.E. does not want to make Zekrit District a place for importing statues to be worshipped. My only hope is to instruct him to send it back to the place where he brought it from under the supervision of the Director of Customs. We will be so grateful to you for doing that and thanks. . With final comoliments. (Sgd) 3ALEIT AL MANA Representative.ORIGINAL IN ARABIC CONFIDENTIAL Dated, 20th November 1947. Dear Saleh, Mr. Langham has sent me your letter 67/5. I would point out that the statuette in question is not for worshipping. The man in question is a Roman Catholic and as such does not worship statues. The fact that he was found in possession of a statue merely means that it was a sign that he is a Roman Catholic. We do not employ anyone who worships statues, and in this instance you will be correct in instructing the Customs Director to hand the statuette back to the man concerns^. Yours sincerely, (3gd) 3.H. Lermitte Saleh el Mana Esq., Dohah. bhl/ea4 V 5 gOPY Translation of letter No. 14/57 dated Slst Novr, 1947, from the Rep. of H.E. the Ruler of £atar, to the Fields Manager, Qatar. After Greetings. Thank you very much for your letter No CL/l/1169 dated 18th November 1947, concerning the statue. Hoping to receive a reply from yo'Jas soon as possible as H.E. is pressing on me to know the results. With best compliments. (Sgd) SALEH AL MANA Note; Our CL./1/1169 acknowledged his letter and explained that the matter had been referred to you. EATRANSLATION Dated, 29th November 1947. Dear Mr. Lermitte, Kindest Regards, I am in receipt of your letter of the 20th inst. regarding the statuette concerned. I wrought this to the notice of H.E. but it seems the Director of Customs at Zekrit informed H.E. that yoxiir statement is not consistent with facts, and assured H.E. that the statuette you refer to was nothing but an idol for worship. The Indian concerned himself admitted this much to the Director of Customs. In view of these assurances from the Director of Customs H.E. insists that this idol should leave Dukhan, and that he cannot agree to it nor allow it to remain at Dulhan, as H.E. does not 1 ike Dukhan to become a place for idol worship. Under these circumstances and as the idol is still with the Indian H.E. requests you to instruct the Fields Manager, Dukhan, to remove this idol with the supervision of the Director of Customs, for vhich H.E. would feel grateful.
