This impressive candlestick base was commissioned by Zayn al-Din Kitbugha, who served as \"saqi,\" or cupbearer, at the court of the Mamluk Dynasty in Egypt before ascending the throne in 1294.  The large inscription in \"thuluth\" script around the candlestick's body is punctuated by roundels featuring a stemmed cup, Kitbugha's blazon, or heraldic shield.  Calligraphy is also a major decorative element.  In addition to the large \"thuluth\" inscription, this piece includes different sizes and styles of Arabic script.  Despite its elaborate design, Kitbugha had the candlestick made for use in his household storeroom or pantry.\r\n\r\nThe candlestick's neck and socket- today in the Museum of Islamic Art, Cairo- already had been removed when Mr. Walters added the piece to his growing collection of Islamic art.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1925", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/15804", "Keywords": "Muslim; pattern; calligraphy; decorative; inscribed", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1925, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Bahri Dynasty", "Reign": "Zayn al-Din Kitbugha (AD 1294-1296)", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:15:21.27", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.459_Fnt_DD_T15.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.459_Fnt_DD_T15.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.459_Fnt_DD_T15.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.459_Fnt_DD_T15.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.459_Fnt_DD_T15.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "13, 209, 475", "Images": "PS1_54.459_DetA_DD_T15.jpg, PS1_54.459_DetB__DD_T15.jpg, PS1_54.459_Fnt_DD_T15.jpg, PS1_54.459_Top_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.459_VwA_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.459_VwF_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.459_VwK_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.459_VwP_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.459_VwU_DD_T10.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Third Floor: Islamic Art"}
