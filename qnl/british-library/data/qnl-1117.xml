In the enclosed letter Leeke states that the Persian Gulf Squadron should be reinforced in the coming season to allow a strict observation of vessels returning from the African coast. Leeke states that the
                           Constance, currently undergoing repairs in Bombay, should be sent to the Gulf when ready, supported by an additional vessel. Leeke states that he sees little else that can be done to suppress the slave trade, given that it is carried out using small crafts close to the coast, which can avoid the scrutiny of the British Men of War.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x00006a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
