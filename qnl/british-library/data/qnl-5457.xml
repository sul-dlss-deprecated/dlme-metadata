My dear Howell, Your personal letter of May 18th reached me hy last hag. 1. Noel. I hope the private letters exchanged with Noel of which I sent you copies in my letter of May 15th will finally clear this matter up. Please also believe me that I never attached the slightest blame to Biscoe for the muddle that occurred over the instructions to Noel. Any way that is now ancient history and thirty years of official life have at least taught me that occasional muddles and mis understandings are inevitable and bound to occur and the best thing is to forget about them as soon as they are cleared up. 2. Anting Consu l. Ahma. About this particular matter I can plead not guilty as I \&lt;a.s still on leave when the arrangement was made for Galloway to be acting Consul during Monypenny’s absence. At the same time I tender the apologies of the Legation for the omission to inform you in advance of the proposed arrangement. It never occurred to Parr - the Charge d’Affaires - that he was 'appointing an officer of the Indian Political service to a Levant Consular post'. I am very glad however of this opportunity to try and get clear on a point which has never been clear to me yet - namely the r : : ~ ~sr;u; - —d m' 11 i i _ l p |1' i the exact relation of the Resident at Bushire to officers of the Indian Political Department serving in Persia. You say in your letter 'I am sure you will agree that, if there is any proposal to change the post held hy an officer of the Indian Political Department it is desirable that Biscoe (l.e., presumably in his capacity as Resident and as such the Senior Indian Political Officer serving in Persia) should be consulted beforehand in order that he may be in a position to inform the Government of India and advise them regarding the consequential changes waiich may arise'. Now I was unaware that Galloway (Vice- Consul at Ahwaz) was in any sort of way subordinate to Biscoe whose exequatur does not extend to the province of Khuzistan. Galloway having been a year now at Ahwaz and being more or less au fait with the local conditions and at the same time a perfectly sensible person who moreover had had the advantage of visiting Tehran last year and making acquaintance with myself and members of the Legation, Monypenny considered and recommended to Parr that he should be acting Consul this summer. To my - Foreign Office - way of thinking this is a perfectly normal procedure that v/hen the No. 1 goes away the No. 2 acts for him unless special grounds exist for sending someone specially for the purpose to take charge of the Consulate. I think it was last year that owing to the Indian Political Vice-Consul being newly arrived and quite new to the job we did send down Finch to act for Monypenny. But that was not because FinchForeign and Political department, oirala; the July 1931. tCcci*- ■yi Y s ifcny thanks for your prim.-to letter of 1st June. I fully appreciate your point of view about postings to Consulates and realise that the normal and sensible procedure is that when no. 1 goes away, ilo. 2 should act for him, unless there are special reasons to the contrary. I think that for practical purposes all that need he »..ld is that the Govamaont of India would like when possible to he consulted beforehand when any srrenswnent is proposed which is likely to affect one of their officers. This is necessary in order to avoid inconvenience or mis- undarstandlag, and I would add that, if you see no objection, the Uovenaront of India wuld he glad If the Kcsident at Bushlre could be consulted at the sane time in the case of appointiaents to posts with which he is officially connected i.e. in practice all the postsA TO posts in l orsia nomvily mxmo&lt;k by officers beicrnging to the GovcraAent of India, except Meshed and listen.

Foreign Office, S.W.l. 20th December, 1928, f* tjCrC Sir, ^ I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to refer to your letter Do.P.5900 of the 2nd ultimo, relative to the assumption of charge of the Residency and Consulate General at Bushire by Sir F.Johnston, and to request you to inform the Secretary of State for India in Council that His Majesty's Minister at Tehran telegraphed on the 20th ultimo that he had received no official notification of Sir P.Johnston's appointment, but that, as the fact was within his knowledge, he had officially notified the Persian Government of the appointment. 2 . As it would appear that Sir F.Johnston took over the charge of the Consulate-General from Lieutenant-Colonel Haworth on November 1st, 1923, a Royal Commission will be issued to him bearing that date. 3. I am to request that the attention of the Government of India may be called to the departure in this case from the procedure agreed to in 1925 for the appointment of Indian officials to consular posts in Persia. This procedure was outlined in the Government of India letter No.392 E of November 9th, 1925, which formed the enclosure in the India Office letter No.P 4039 of December 2nd, 1925. In accordance therewith due notification of the change of incumbency at Bushire should have been made by the Government of India not only to this department through the Secretary of State for India, but also to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran in order that, on his application, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs The Under Secretary of State, DfcC India Office0 Affairs might authorise the exercise of consular powers. 4. I am to suggest the desirability of impressing upon the Government of India the fact that consular appointments can only be made under the authority of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. This authority in Persia issues through His Majesty’s Minister in Persia on his application to the Secretary of State, and it is therefore necessary that both Sir Austen Chamberlain and Sir R.Clive should receive from the Government of India early and full information of projected changes. In the present case it will be observed that no official intimation of the cessation of Lieutenant-Colonel Haworth’s appointment and of the appointment of Sir F.Johnston in his stead was made either to this department or to Sir R.Clive. 5. Sir Austen Chamberlain claims no right to be consulted by the Government of India in their selection of an officer to fill the post of Political Resident at Bushire, but only to be inlormed officially and in good time of their decision, in view of the fact that the official selected acts in the dual capacity of Political Resident and Consul-General, and therefore requires to be invested with consular powers.

(With 2 spare copies).various instructions issued from time to time on the subject and the actual procedure adopted in practice have become so confusing and difficult of application that the time has come to formulate, in a consolidated form, the procedure to be adopted in future which should, if possible, locate the responsibility in one quarter. As the Minister and the London Foreign Office are mainly concerned with consular powers, the Government of India are inclined to the opinion that the responsibility for obtaining the necessary consular powers from the London Foreign Office and for prompt report to them of the change of personnel might reasonably be transferred to the Minister. To ensure that he shall receive timely information of such matters, the Government of India propose to lay down f (i) that the Minister should be consulted by them before any changes of personnel in the consular and vice^eonsular appointments in Persia are decided upon , the previous orders requiring local authorities to send copies of leave aoplioations to the Minister being cancelled; (ii) that when a change has been decided upon, the local authorities concerned (the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Consul, Sistan and Consul General, Meshed, as the case may be) shall send telegraphic information to the Minister beforehand, of the probable date of the arrival of the new incumbent and, when actual transfer takes place, they should send a telegraphic charge it report to the Government of India, repeating/to Mum* 5# Before the matter is referred to His Majesty's Government, the Government of India will be glad to be informedinformed (if possible by telegram) whether the proposed arrangement meets with your approval.

Kecent instances are those of Major Wisher, who is reported to have taken charge of His Majesty’s Consulate at Seistan, and of Mr. Hyan, who would appear to be officiating as Vice-Consul at ^hwaz. Ho information is, however, available in this department as to whether Mr. Gould, who was appointed His Majesty’s Consul at Seistan in 1918, has relinquished that appointment or whether he is on leave and will resume duty at Seistan. Nor has any information been received as to the position of Captain Gastrell, who was appointed His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Ahwaz in 1922, and whose departure, on leave or otherwise, has not been notified to the foreign Office. 3. I am therefore to enquire whether arrangements could be made whereby all movements of India Government A officials acting in Persia in consular capacities shall A MAY-925U) ' 2 '- ' - ? y be The Under Secretary of State, India Office,Pinch was a Levant Service Officer, hut because he had had five or six years experience of Persia and knew the language while the actual Vice Consul on the spot was at the time quite inexperienced for so important a post as acting Consul in Khuzistan.

But I should he extremely grateful if you would let me know/ for the general information of the Legation what is exactly the position of the Resident in such matters. Again please believe me there was no idea or intention of side-tracking Biscoe. It was sheer ignorance on the part of the Legation as to what is exactly in the view of the Government of India the locus standi of the Resident in matters which to us here seem to he outside his competence.

We, too, have no information about the particular case of Captain Cntien, but we agree with you as to the necessity for keeping the Legation in close touch with postings of this nature.

Changes in the personnel of Political appointments in Persia to which consular duties are attached. Sir, f&gt;&gt; I am directed to enclose for your information a copy of a letter from the Inlia Office, No*P.1402/25, dated the 20th May 1925 (with enclosures) which emphasizes the necessity of giving prompt information to the Secretary of State for India regarding changes in consular appointrnen* in Persia. 2. Orders have from time to time been issued by the Government of India to ensure the transmission of prompt information in this respect to the Secretary of State and to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. The existing orders and practice may be summarised as follows (I) On receipt of charge reports (which are generally made by telegram, the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, under standing orders, send telegraphic information to the Secretary of State of the changes of personnel in the appointments of Consuls i-.f ; x whether substantive or acting , giving full details regarding the officer to be appointed and date of appointment and requesting that the necessary consular powers be conferred. (II) The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf 1 the!i • * a the Consul General, Meshed, and the Consul, Slstan, are required, under standing orders of the Government of India, v to forward to the Minister copies of all applications for Vide Foreign Department letter Ka#1995- 0 leave from consular , dated the 31st August 1906. 0 —— —-— — officers in order to enable him to express, if necessary, an opinion as to the special qualifications required of the successor. (Ill) Although there do not seem to be any clear orders as to the procedure to be adopted as regards the appointment of Vice Consuls, it has always been understood that the Minister,on receipt of information of changes, takes the necessary steps for obtaining consular powers from the London Foreign Office direct, and 40 intimation is therefore sent by the Government of India to the Secretary of State &lt;• in these cases. 3. In the case of Captain Fisher's appointment to Sistan the failure to send prompt information to the Secretary of State was due to delay in the receipt of the report of transfer of charge from Mr. Gould to Captain Fisher. No responsibility would however appear to rest on the Government of India in respect of the changes in the personnel of Vice-Consuls, Duzdap.and Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, since it was understood that, in accordance with the practice referred to above, the necessary information would be sent to the London Foreign Office by the Minister. In connection with the appointment of Captain D.R.Smith, as Vice-Consul, Duzdap, the India Office, at the instance of the London Foreign Office, instructed the Government of India in February last to send direct to the Minister telegraphic advice regarding changes of consular personnel in Persia (including presumably changes in Vice-Consular appointments) prior to the arrived on the Frontier, of the consular officers concerned. 4* The Government of India are of opinion that the - various : ■) ■&gt;- Iiimnnui Iir. -H.Ise oommunioated promptly and fully to this departmsnt and to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. 4. Mr. Chamberlain also desires that when requests are preferred to this department for the issue of consular pov/ers to an official in Persia, such requests may invariably he accompanied by a definite statement as to whether it is desired that the official concerned should be appointed substantively or only in an acting capacity during the absence of the titular holder of the post. In the event of a substantive appointment being required it is essential that this department should be furnished with the full names, decorations, etc. of the officer to be appointed, and with the actual date from which it is desired that the appointment should take effect.
