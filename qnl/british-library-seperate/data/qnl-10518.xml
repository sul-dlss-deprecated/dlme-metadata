The proposed appointment was considered necessary because of the prospective inauguration of an air route along the southern coast of Arabia, and because the Sultans of Muscat and Oman had recently shown a tendency to spend a great part of their time in Dhofar province.The papers cover: a proposal by the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for the construction of a bungalow at Salalah to enable the Political Agent to visit the area at intervals, 28 October 1941; correspondence between the Political Agent, Muscat, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel William Rupert Hay) concerning recruitment to the post of British Agent at Salalah, including the suggested appointment of a Kuwaiti citizen, February-March 1942; and correspondence concerning the appointment of a Sub-Assistant Surgeon at Salalah, May-November 1942.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Political Agent</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Salalah</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000351#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000351#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
