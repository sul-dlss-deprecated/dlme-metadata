(1) Please see P.Z.4830/34, regarding the case of five escaped slaves at Henjam who requested to be taken away on H.M.S* 'Bideford'. The Commanding officer seems to have been wise to refuse this request, which might have involved trouble with the Persian GoJI^fc, since the Persian Governor had already told the slaves that he would let them go when he got permission from Tehran, for which he had applied and had refused to hand over the slaves to their owners^ an this connection it will be remembered that Colonel Fowle recently expressed the view that there was now little or no danger of the Persian authorities at Henjam handing back slaves to their owners* (P.Z*4070/33).(2) P.Z.4849/34 concerns the case of 8 fugitive slaves at Khassab who were given refuge on board H.M.S* 'Lupin' and conveyed to Muscat for manumission. It appears that the slaves were being sent to Debai in a dhow, in satisfaction of a debt, and the Senior Naval officer repor this sort of barter of slaves is showing signs of being on the increase, owing to the effects of the trade depression. He is issuing special instructions to His Majesty^ ships in the Gulf to keep a particular look-out for such cases. In the present instance the dhow was not confiscated by H.M.S. 'Lupin' since technically it was not engaged in the slave trade, but merely in carrying passengers in the normal way, wnich is bound at times to include slaves. The Vali of Khassab, which is in Muscat territory, certainly did nothing to prevent the slaves being taken away to the Trucial Coast, out his attitude appears to have been one of laisser faire rather than active assistance. : A SEEN IRDLITICAL COMMITTEE.FUGITIVE SLAVES - KHASSAB:- Letter No.27/402, dated the 10th May, 1934, from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.

Immediately LUPIN anchored at KHASSAB at 1514 on Monday 26th March, two men representing themselves as slaves, one of itfiom had manacles on his ankles, reported on board requesting to he manumitted. 2. The elder gave his name as SALVA bin NOOBI (slave No. 1) and stated that he was the fat er of the other, BELLAL, (slave No.* 2) and that then both belonged to one KHALIFA bin MOHAMSD bin THAN! of KHASSAB. He stated they with others were being sent to DIBAI in a dhow then lying off LUPIN*s starboard quarter and that he had another and younger son SANOQM (slave No.3) in this dhow. While obtaining this information three other men came off from shore stating that they also were slaves who wished to be manumitted. I accordingly sent an armed boat away to search all the four dhows then lying in the bay. Two were Persian dhows (SAMBUKS) just arrived from QISHM, one a BOOM which had arrived the previous day from DIBAI, and lastly the dhow above mentioned (a JALLIBAUT) which had arrived at KHASSAB about ten days previou sly and was leaving the following day for DIBAI. In this dhow I found slave No. 3 as slave No.l stated, also slave No.1*8 son-in-law and daughter with their two children. 3. I accordingly sent for and interviewed the Wali, MU * AFAR bin SULLIMAIN, and then wei^ied and proceeded with the dhow which was carrying the slaves in tow, and re-joined you in ELPHIMSTONB INLET. 4. No. 1 at First batch of slav es. The history of the slaves as given me by slave the subsequent investigation i s as follows:- Slave No.l - SALFA bin NOOBI Slave No.2 - BELLAL bin SALFA !;eldest son 17-13) Slave No.3 - SANOOM bin SALFA (small son aced about IQ). these men originally lived at HKEJAM as slaves to MOHAMiSD bin THANY, a Pearl merchant. Four or five yjars ago when the Arab exodus from HENJAM took place they all moved to KHASSAB, where two years ago MOHAM ED died and was succeeded by....by his son KHALIFA. Besides succeeding to the slayes KHALIFA succeeded to a debt which his father had contracted with MOHAMMSD bin AHMED LKLMOOH, a Pearl merchant of DKBAI. (brother in law of Shaikh SA’IP). 5. KHALIFA recently visited DIBAI where he interviewed MOHAMMED and appears to have come to an agreement with him, that the slaves should be sent to DIBAI in partial liquidation of his debt. KHALIFA returned to KHASSAB in the boom mentioned in paragr^&gt;h2, on 25th March accompanied by one 0B3IP bin SAGGAR a representative of KOHAMMBD bin AHMED, bearing a letter addressed to the WALI in which Shaikh SA’ID of DIBAI explained that KHALIFA’s father had been in debt to Shaikh MOHAMMED and asked the WALI to assist in the recovery of the debt (Letter attached). 6 . When ordered to proceed on board the dhow for conveyance to Dibai, slave No,l refused to do so for himself and his family, and on the morning of 26th March he was taken before the WALI by KHALIFA and OBEID• The WALI states that he informed KHALIFA and OBKID that he was not going to interfere and that they must settle the matter themselves. They accordingly manacled the slave and took him and slaves Nos. 2 and 3 on bca rd the dhow. A female slave, the ex wife of slave No*l also belonging to KHALIFA was taken off to the chow at the same time. She however was later allowed to proceed ashore to collect the family’s belongings and was thus not on board the dhow when it was boarded by LUPIN’s party. 7. With regard to the attitude adopted Ly the WALI, it appears to have been ane of ’’laisser-faire” rather than active assistance, except that slave No#l states that the manacles were produced by one of the WALI’s servants and the NOKHADAH of the dhow states that three of the WALI’s bodyguard were in the boat which brought the slaves off* Second batch d‘ slaves* 8 . Slave No.4 - SA’ADSIN bin PARHAM 5 - MESHMOON son of £) ove 6 - JUMA bin BELLAL slave No* 6 also belongs to KHALIB'A bin MOHAMMED bin THANY and was afraid that he would be sent to EIBAI against his wish similarly to slaves Nos. 1-3. 9. The case of slaves Na. 4 and 5 is of a similar nature to that of the ethers. Originally they lived with their rm ster MOHAMMHP bin SA’ID, a pearl merchant at HKNJAM, but migrated to KHASSAB four or five years ago* Their raaster MOHAMM D died at DIBAI about 3 years ago and they became the property of his son AHMKD who, about a year ago freed them. They have since been living peaceably at KHASSAB. 10. The father MOHAMMT-D was however in debt to MOHAMMED BIMBKYAT a pearl merchant of DIBAI, and about a month ago, slave No. 4 received a letter from MOHAMMED BIMBKYAT telling him to come with his family to DIBAI in satisfaction &lt;tf the debt owed by his late master. This letter the slave took to the WALI who, the slave states, told them to do as they liked about it. On 25th March, seeing...seeing the treatment to which slave No. 1 had been subjected and fearing a similar fate, slaves 4 and 5 came off to LUPIN when she anchored and asked to be officially manumitted. 11 . Bxcept in regard to the production of the manacles and the composition of the boat’s *rew whifr conveyed the slaves to the dhow - which the WALI did not mention - he gave me the same story. The dhqw. IS. The dhow hails from ^IBAI and is owned by SALIM bin MUSSABiSH. The NOKHAPAH’s name is SALIM bin SALMAN. She carried a certificate of ownership signed by the shaikh ol BIBAI* Ihe NOKHAlAH stated that he was engaged in yeneraL trading of which he got 50^ of the profits and that he had come to KHASSAB for water which, after having called at BIBAI, he was ta&amp;rigto ABU DHABI, There were a large number of filled water tanks on board and there was no sign of the dhow having been specially fitted for carrying slaves. 13. The daughter of slave No.l whom the boarding officer found in this dhow said that she had cone off with her children of her own volition and intended to follow her father. Her husband said that he also had cone off to the dhow voluntarily when he saw LUPIN entering the bay in order to take his father-in-law over to LUPIN. The NOKHADAH, when questioned as to tfiy he had slaves on board said that they had been brought off by OBKII) with the WALI * 8 'soldiers” and that OBEIB was paying for their passage. He said that he put no obstacles in their way when they wanted to comb over to LUPIN and this was corroborated by the slaves. 14. A copy of this report is being handed to the Honourable the Political Agent on arrival at MUSCAT.(Trai slation of a letter sent froci S^'Ip bin MC..TOOM, ShaiHi of DEB.il to the of KH^3S,3). iifter the compliments With regards bin r i$LiNI who died at KHaSS-dB is in debt to the SiLJKH MQfiiJQiXD bin *BMD bin DEUOQH.

I concur with the Commanding Officer in paragraph 7 of the above report. 3. The Dhow was not technically engaged in the slave trade but was engaged in carrying passengers in the normal way which at times of course includes slaves. 4. This barter of slaves, which shows symptoms of being on the increase, due to the effects or the general trade depression, is of course illegal and all the more deplorable aw ire results in the separation of families and in the sale of young girls, mere child reh, as concubines. Unless it is stanped on now this traffic will naturally grow. 5. It is difficult, to detect as it can be carried on surreptitiously and involves no increase in the actual number of slaves. Moreover it is frequently to the advantage of the individual slaves themselves to be transferred fom a poor to a rich owner, who is able to give them better food and keep them in greater comfort, while women, being Moslems, lave less opportunity oi reporting their cases than the men. 6. Though, as will be seep from the enclosed report that, a master who had freed his slaves attempted to send them to the Trucial Coast in settlement of his debt, I would like to emphasise that there is no indication that new slaves are impressed that this foxm oi traffic is confined to those who are already slaves.* I «» 7.

Z. On 3rd May, at Henjam, a Baluchi from Baluchistan, named FSRQfc HASSAK of Bakab JeoeIi7 came on board and stated that he was one,of 5 slaves who had escaped from Bakab Jedeh, near Ahassab, (Sheikh Mohammed) and landed here from a fishing boat about a month ago. st£. 3. He requested that they should be taken away from Henjam and given their freedom, as he said they were starving. 4. The Assistant to the Clerk-in~Charge t who acted as interpreter ('BIIEfGRD^ 1 interpreter having not yet rejoined) said he knew of these men and that they had been to see him before. The Governor had given them work on house building at 6 annas a day, and had told them he would let them go when he got permission from Teheran for which he had applied. 5. The owners of the slaves arrived at Henjam about one week after the slaves themselves and asked for them to be handed back. 6. The Governor refused to hand over the slaves, and sent the owners away after confiscating their arms. 7. MRCK HASSAN said the reason they were starving was, that being divers, they could not do tne house building work. 8. The Assistant Clerk said that they worked some days when they chose, and that the work was open'to them. 9. The man i'ERQEZ HASSAN had already been on board H.M.S. ,, LIIPIK ,, and stated his case. 10.

The main motive why slaves have on one or two occasions in the past been returned to slavery by the Persian authorities is fear of aggression by powerful ’ersian tribal owners, v ^ nu*. * (vide my despatch N 0 .147, dated the 23th September 1931), but this only occurs at places such as Task in the neigh bourhood of which Bersian control is Ineffective, and not at places such as Hen jam which are under control of the local/ V.A.L.Hallet, ^squire, H.M. , ii Charge d’Affaires, British Legstion, ^hrar.* * . i local Persian authorities. MoreoTer the Jask case quoted concerned slaves who had escaped from Arslan owners on Persian soil, and tdio took refuse with the local .IgrM&amp;Ii authorities, so in such cases we don’t really come into the picture. 4, Apart from what I have said in the previous para graph, as Hoare points out if the Coiwaander of whatever H.M. Sloop happens to he in Henjam when slaves land on the island, hints to the local ^ersian authorities, in whatever way he thinks fit, that he knows of their arrival, they - the local authorities, with one eye on the publicity which would follow on any incorrect procedure on their part, will act correctly. I am sending a copy of this le ter to 'Eraser-^ytler, (Officiating foreign Secretary to the Government of India), and to Walton at the India Office, and to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf T&gt;iYisbn, with copy of Hoare’s despatch.

Grateful for telegraphic instructions. RESIDENT.76 ‘ Brltiati Legation, Oulhek. 3rd June, 1938. Sir, It eo happened that when I reoeived pour telegram Ho. 84 of Hap 18th, respecting two slaves who had eaeaped from Kas-ul-Khalaah to Henjam, I alremap had It In mp mind to seek an Interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the following dap. Your telegram decided me to seek the Interview without further delap. 4 s I have Informed pou In mp telegram Ho. 36 of Map 22nd, His Highness undertook to send Instructions to Henjam that the matter should he settled in s sensible wap and that the slaves should he allowed to leave. If they wished to do so, in Bis Ms Jest p's ship 'Mdeford'. I hope that these instructions reached Honjaa in tin# to prevent any oompllontlons with the looal authorities. 3. It map be useful if I explain mp own vise of the problem presented hp the possible desire of the two slaves to seek refuge la His Majestp’s Ship 'Bidsford'. 8 . There ean be no doubt that If the slaves h«4 r+-c»*fti»ked of their own accord (I assume that it would not in any circumstances have been in order for the commander to inrite them to re-embarfc) the commander would hare been free t according to international law and custom, to Conrey than to some non-Persian port. But though he would hove been free to sot in this wap, ho would not have been under nn absolute obligation to do so. The Persian authsrltiss night therefore hove claimed that he should not have The Honourable The Political keeldent la the Persian Oulf /admittedadmitted thaw on board f still lass Haas conveyed tfesm away from Fersia, unless he were satisfied that they had left Persian soil after compliance with the usual formalities. frhether these claims would have been tenable or not in the oase of British Protected persona, it is clear that if the commander had perelated in transporting the slaves in the face of a Persian complaint, expressed at the time by the local authorities, that they had gone on board In spite of express orders not to do so, and in the absence of any reason to suppose that the slaves were In danger of being returned to slavery, the Persian Government would have had an arguable case. &amp;uoh a ground of complaint, coming on top of the Incident of the four slaves of 1951, might in fact have provided them with a welcome excuse for declaring that the presence of His Majesty's Ships at Henjam was not the harmless phenomenon I had always represented it to be, but led on the contrary to constant interference with Persian administrative procedure. d» In view of these considerations and of the further consideration that, even if the slaves were to be conveyed elsewhere in one of His Majesty's Ships without the Persian authorities being aware of it at the time, they would be very likely to learn all about it later, it seemed to me that the best course was to invite the cooperation of the Persian Government at the outset. 1 realise that It must always be a difficult matter for the commander of one of His Majesty's Ships to know whether escaped slaves are la danger of being returned to slavery by the Persian authorities at fienjam, but X should surmise that a very alight display of imtamaat am hi a part would be sufficioit to deter the anfacing the inevitable publicity which would follow on any undue delay in nanualtting the alavea or on their return, under any pretext whatever and even after the departure of the ahlp, to their former owners on the Arab coast* This is, however, a point upon which X should be reluctant to dogmatise, and where doubt exists the interests of the escaped slaves must always bs paramount I am sending copies of this despatch, together with a copy of your telegram under reference, to His Majesty*a Principal secretary of State for Foreign Affaire (fTo* 869) and to the Foreign Secretary to tha Government of India (Ho* 118).

Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of two despatches from the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reporting on instances of slavery in Persian territory. The despatch of August 21st referred to in the first enclosure was concerned with the case of a boy who was kidnapped but subsequently returned to his father. 2. The most lamentable side of these cases of slavery is the inability of the Persian authorities to take any steps to remedy the existing state of affairs. It will be observed from paragraph 3 of Bushire despatch No.147 that even the Officer Commanding troops at Jask was afraid not to hand back to the owner a slave who had escaped and taken refuge with him. 3. The Minister of the Interior has sinced issued a circular to local authorities reminding them that Persia is a signatory of the International Convention for the suppression of slavery and instructing them to publish the Persian anti-slavery law in every district and to see that its terms are rigorously enforced even among the tribes living in the remotest parts of the country. This is easier said than done. 4.

Sir, In continuation of my despatch No.125/1752, dated the ^Ist August 1931, I have the honour to state for your ini ormation that I have received a report from the Officer-in- Charge, Telegraphs, Jask, giving two further instances of slavery within the Persian borders. 2. On the 3rd September two slaves belonging to one Lala of Bir escaped and took refuge with the Persian officials. Mir Shah Beg, the headman of Bir, who was in Jask at the time demanded the return of the slaves and threatened to seize two men in their place if his demand was not granted. The Persian authorities declined to yield up the slaves and Mir Shah Beg after waiting a few days at Yekbuni left. But it is reported that he has left only to collect some followers and return. 5. On the 6th instant a slave belonging to Ahmad Tahir of Yekdar escaped and took shelter with the Rais-i- Ciushun. Mir Chiragh son of Mustapha Khan, headman of old Jask, asked for his return and threatened reprisals if his request was not conceded. The slave was immediately handed over.

Sir, In continuation of my despatch No.147/1993 dated the 25th September, 1931, regarding the escape of 2 slaves belonging to Lala of Bir, I have the honour to state that I have received from the Officer in Charge Telegraphs, Jask, the following further report on the subject. On the 13th October, a party of about 18 Baluchis arrived at Yekbuni and threatened to attack Jask unless the 2 slaves were surrendered. The Persian authorities opened negotiations with the insurgents and in this way managed to keep them quiet until the 24th September, when, in response to urgent calls for help, Sultan Ali Akbar Khan with 50 soldiers arrived from Bandar Abbas. The Baluchis about 24 in number retired to the •hills and defied the troops, who had followed them up to attack them. One Barkat Khan with 6 armed followers arrived on the scene and persuaded the Baluchis not to fire on the troops. The troops have made several small raids and there are about 15 men now detained in the fort. With reference to para.3 of my despatch under reference, Chiragh son of Mustapha Khan has forbidden his men to bring firewood into New Jask. According to local gossip, the troops would like to e f ffe ct his arrest H.B.M's Charge d f Affaires, British Legation,arrest, but are not at present sufficiently strong to risk the attempt. Apart from the question of the slaves, the above is interesting as it shows that the Persian hold on to Jask district is at present far from strong. I have, etc., (Signed) T.C.W.FOWLE. Offg.

This report shows clearly the parts played by the Clerk-in- Charge of the Telegraph Station, the Commanding Officers of His Majesty’s Ship 'Penzance' and 'Folkestone', and, I may add, the four slaves themselves. 2. it appears to me that Mr.Lowe acted quite correctly and 1 share Captain Crabbe’s view that Commander Yates, having once received the slaves on board, acted correctly and with courtesy towards the Persian officials. 3. While these enquiries have been proceeding, the Persian Government have made no further mention of the case and I am anxious, if possible, not to re-open the coi respondence. It would be easy to answer the assertions in the note of September 10th one by one, but the Persian Government have made it practically impossible to reply to them in a manner at once truthful and conciliatory and there is no need to provoke them unnecessarily over any matter affecting Henjam.

Perhaps the Honourable the Political Resident would be Rind enough to note that I was not present at Henjam at the time, and though two accounts of tne affair have been forwarded under cover of my communication dated 27th June, 1931, No.28/404, I have tnought it desiraole to recapitulate tne order of events as disclosed by the evidence before me. SECTION I - PnRT PLAfED BY CLrIiK.~IN--Cind&lt;GE . TELEGRAPH STATION AHD BY H. M«. SHIPS. 3. The individuals named below appeared before Hr. Lowe, ClerJC-in-Charge, Telegraph Station, Henjam, at about 5.30 p.m. on Saturday, 20th June i - KHAIREJ BU GAiiOOSH .••••••• Born at Lamoo near Zanzibar in 1386. MUBAREK BIN F^PLAJ-I-ALLAH . . . . MUBAREE BU MUHKER MMiAHIR BIN SA'ID Born at Suwalicira in Sudan in 1906. Born in jiusemb&amp;rl in Suwahai in 1891. Born at Edeia, south of B&amp;raimi in 1900. These four men had escaped from Snarj&amp;h in a stolen dhow, they alleged they were slaves and claimed protection from the Clerit-in-Charge, under the impression apparently that he was the Political Agent, for they had asEed a Henjam native where the Political Agent was to be found and had been directed to proceed to the Telegraph Station. 4. The ClerE-in-Charge, having never been called upon to deal with slaves, wae at a loss how to act. He did not give the men snelter, but they remained near the Telegraph buildings and were causing him some embarrassment. Mr. Lowe then asked the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. 'FOLKESTONE' for advice in the matter. Commander Yates requested him to send the men to 'FOLKESTONE'. He sent in an officer from the ship to look into the matter2. the matter* An the officer was proceeding inehore he passed the dhow with the slaves on board. They hailed 'FOLKESTONE'*s motor-boat and asited to be tajcen off to the ship. Their dhow was taicen in tow and they arrived on board the ship at about 11.30 p.m. 5. As 'FOLKESTONE' was under orders to proceed to jfa&amp;cat next day, 22nd June, the slaves were transferred to 'PENZANCE' which was under orders to proceed to the Trucial Coast. At first sight this transfer may seem to be an unnecessary proceed ing, but 'FOLKESTONE'* acted in compliance with instruction* issued by me in May last, which require Commanding Officers to maice enquiries at any port from which alleged slaves are stated to have escaped before a report is made to the Political authorities. There is always a possibility nowadays that fugitives might be free men who have fled from their homea to the protection of H.N. Ships so as to avoid meeting their just obligations on shore. 6. 'PENZANCE' proceeded to sea on 22nd, visited the Trucial Coast, verified the fact that the fugitives were slaves and returned to Henjam on 23rd June. 7. On 26th June the slaves were transferred to 'HASTINGS' to await Instructions from the Political Resident, these instruc tions having been received on 27th June (Bushire Message No.375), the slaves were re-embarked on board 'PENZANCE' and were taken to Mascat where tney were handed over to the Political Agent and Consul on 2nd July. 8. SECTION IX - PART PLAYED BY PERSIAN AUTHORITIES THiLIR GO^JHIC^IO^S *ITH H.d.SHIPS . For thirty hours or so after the arrival of the slaves at Henjam the part played by the Persian authorities was purely passive. The stolen dhow arrived in broad daylight, the slaves went ashore, made open enquiries, spent five hours odd on the island, but no one made any move to assist them. The Deputy Governor was away staying with a friend in Old Henjam, but neither the Mudir of Customs or Chief of Police took the slightest interest in the men. Whether or not the slaves knew that they were free once they had landed on Persian territory, it is evident that they were not satisfied with their status, for they returned to their dhow and proceeded to make preparations for coming on board 'FQLKESTONE ,, . 9. It appears that the slave owner came to Henjam in pursuit of his men and wrote a letter to the Deputy Governor claiming them on tne grounds that they were divers - whether he arrived on 20th or 21st is not clear. Having received the slaves on board, the Commanding Officer 'FOLKESTONE' decided that they must remain under the protection of the British Flag, but at 10.00 a.nu on 21st June, as an act of courtesy, he sent an officer on shore to inform the Deputy Governor that the slaves had surrendered voluntarily on board the ship. The Deputy Governor was still absent from home, so a mesuage of a general nature was left for him. He returned from his holiday that evening, and the following messages were exenanged between him and 'FOLKESTONE' through the Royal Indian Marine, Signal Station. From ••3 n From Clerk-in-Charge, R.I.M. Fuel Depot, Henjam. To r FOLKESTONE'. Following reoeired from Deputy Oovtrnor, HenJam. I have juat arrived from Henjam. Sorry I could not meet your Lieutenant to-day. Please tell me what you wanted and oblige. (T.O.R. 2226/SI). From 'FOLKESTONE*. To ••• Deputy Governor. Than* you for your signal. I sent an officer aahore to-day to present ay compliments and to inform you tuat I had taken on board 'FOLKESTONE* 4 Arab slaves from Sharjah who had claimed British protection with Clerk-in-Charge, Telegraphs. These slaves are being handed over to the proper authorities. (2246/21;. From •• Deputy Governor. To 'FOLKESTONE*. Thanks very much for your signal; will you please hand over the 4 slaves to me and 1 will settle the case according to your wishes. (T.O.R. 2346/21). From 'FOLKESTONE'. To Deputy Governor. Thank you. Slaves have already been transferred to 'PENZANCE' who leaves early to-morrow morning. (2352/21). 10. Owing to the movements of 'FOLKESTONE' and 'PENZANCE' no further ooamiunications took place with the Deputy Governor until 24th June, when 'PENZANCE** informed him that the slaves having come on board voluntarily, the opportunity was taken of settling the matter when visiting Sharjah, and that it was now in the hands of the Political authorities, he was not satisfied with this explanation and maintained the view that the slaves should have been handed over to him. He stated too, that (a) He knew on Saturday night - 20th June - that the slaves had arrived at Henjam and tuat they had gone on board 'FOLKESTONE'. (b) The slave owner had claimed the men from him as divers, not slaves. SBgrtOM XXI ..0 4* SECTION III - ATTITUDE oF SEN I OK NAVAL OFFICER . 11* I was Informed on 21st Jane that slaves had come on board ,f F0LKE8TuNE' and on 22nd Jane ti.at the Coiumandlng Officer had had communication with the Depat/ Governor. As the slaves were already on board one of H.M. Ships, I was clearly bound by Article &gt;9 of the Instructions for the Suppression of the Slave Trade which forbid me to entertain or admit any demand for surrender on the ground that the men are slaves. I set out to satisfy myself that conduct had been avoided wnicn might appear to be a breach of International comity and good faith and further that the action of the fugitives in coming on board 'FOLKESTONE* 1 was purely voluntary. 12. As the Deputy Governor would certainly aiaice a report to his superiors, I despatched a message, 1226 of 23rd June, to the honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, giving a short account of the proceedings and requesting instructions. It appeared to me that the Deputy Governor (who ’I'll' has no respect wnatever for the truth) would state a plausible case against us, and I did not want the British Political and Diplomatic authorities to be taiten by surprise if a protest was suddenly made by the Persian Government. IS. I have informed tne Commanding Officer of 'FOLKESTONE' that in my opinion the incident might have been handled better; for instance, he might have instructed Mr. Lowe to asK tne fugitives to turn to the Persian authorities, adding s rider to the effect that of course there was a British warship in the roadstead where no doubt they would receive an asylum, however, having received the men on board, Commander Yates' proceedings appear to me to have been correct, and his act of courtesy in J sending a message to the Deputy Governor has had the effect of giving prominence to the fact that the official in question, nor indeed any other Persian officials, took the slightest interest I in the slaves for over twenty-four hours. The Deputy Governor claims that he knew all about the men on 20th June, this is more than doubtful for he was apparently on holiday and did not ta&amp;e any action at all in the matter until his attention was directed to it by the Commanding Officer himself, late on the night of 21at June. 14. In the circumstances, therefore, it seems that we may claim to have acted with courtesy and consideration. The men were intent on giving themselves up to a British official, so it may be claimed that they boarded 'FOLKESTONE' voluntarily. The Persians had their opportunity to deal with them, but failed to take it. It is not our fault that fugitives, who may or may not know that they are free men so soon as they land on Penlan territory, board one or other of our ships with tae object of gaining their freedom from the state of slavery. 16. I would add taat Mr. Lowe is no longer in charge at Henjam - he was invalided to India in August last. 16. So far as is known no steps were taken by the local I authorities against the slave-owner.

CTie Radio station Incident. The tranquility at Henj am was suddenly disturbed on 20th July by an incident, serious in itself at the time, but not without its humourous side. It appears that there is a Regulation in Persia, as in other countries, forbidding the use of W/T sets without taking out a license or permit. Some time ago details of this law came to the notice of the Deputy Governor and of the Nazmieh of Police, Henjam. It is known that these two officials had many a conference on the question of its applicability to the Radio Section of the Telegraph Station in the Island. Evidently they did not wish to take any act ive steps in the matter while H.M.,;hipa were anchored in the roadstead, but so soon as the harbour was clear, on 20th July, they both called officially upon the Clerk-in- Charge of the Telegraph Station and requested him to produce his permit authorising the use of the radio transmitting and receiving sets. The Clerk-in-Charge was unable to produce any such document and assured them that the Station was exempt from the apnlication of the Regulation quoted by them. They would not listen to reason and proceeded to seal the transmitting and receiving set In use at the time. Having taken this action they departed in an excellent humour, not heeding the warnings of the Clerk-in-Charge that they were probably raising up some trouble for themselves. 4. They were so completely ignorant of any of the first principles of Radio and the intricacies of Radio sets that it took them a long time to affix the seals. They were especially worried by a small loud speaker which is used when atmospherics are bad, but finally gave up any idea of sealing it. To cut a long story short the action taken by them hardly inconvenienced the transmission or receiving sets at all. 6 , The Clerk-In-Charge telegraphed to his Manager in Karachi who took up the matter with H.B.M’s Legation, Tehran. The Clerk-in-Gharge, Fuel Depot sent me a message on thesame subject which was passed to the Honourable the Political Resident, who also represented the matter to Tehran. Apparently the Persian authorities were....were surprised at the news of for a peremptory telegram came break the seals at once* their subordinates’ action to the Police Nazmieh to » 6. On the receipt of this telegram the Razmieh laid the responsibility in this matter on the shoulders of the Deputy Governor and refused to act without his authority* The Deputy Governor maintained it was no concern of his* The Naamieh then said the telegram was not sufficient authority since the original law was in writing* Another telegram came from Tehran and finally a third from Bushire, both men then went on 28th July and broke the seals together, apologising for the delay and trouble caused* They reported their action to Tehran and received the disappointing reply that their explanation of the incident was awaited with some impatience. So far as I know they are still endeavouring to fix the responsibility on each other. 7* Though the inconvenience caused to the Telegraph Station might very well have been serious f I cannot help viewing this incident v/ith feelings of satisfaction. The two officials made a bad mistake and know it, besides the Quarantine Medical Officer has taunted them for their stupidity. They have been realising If thet Tehran seems to be taking less and less interest in their activities and this incident will make all the Persian officials in the Island very careful in future. 8. The Relief of the Deputy Governpr,^d i^oto^ir. Confirmation has been received that the Deputy Governor is due for relief shortly. He told my Secretary a few days ago that he had been offered the choice of the Postmasterships of Bandar Abbas, Lingah or Jack, but that he had replied to the effect that he wanted three months’ leave before taking up another appointment. He explained that he had property in Central Persia which needed his attention, he also wished to travel for a month or so, he is particularly anxious to visit Tehran, Meshed and possibly also BasrahJ At Basrah of course he looked forward to seeing something of the TRIAD!! The man must be an incorrigible liar for we happen to know definitely that he has telegraphed to the Provincial Director of his department protesting against his appointment to the unimportant postal branch office in Kishm. H e stated in his telegram that his services deserved a hi^ier post, and that he had already recommended his peon for the Kishm Office. 9* It is understood that the new Postmaster will not be appointed as Deputy Governor. That office may go to the Quarantine Medical Officer, a young man who has shewn himself to be of a friendly disposition. BAaimi* 10* I visited Basidu on 9th August and enquired into a comolaint which had been made by the Persian llUdir of Customs to the effect that the Caretaker had interfered with the Persian Customs adriini strati on. I have sent a separate report on this matter to the Political Resident. It appears that the Mudir has taken to coming into British territory as of right to deal with dhows anchored off the concession. The Caretaker has very properly told the Mudir that he has no • • • • • jurisdiction- 3 - n Jiapisdlction. I have asked the Politioal Resident to have this Mudir informed throu^i the proper channels that his duties begin and end outside the limits of the British Concession. 11. RIOTING AT BASRAH^ All is now ^iiiet at that port, but there is still a certain nervousness in official circles that the opposition may seize some favourable opportunity at a later date to embarrass the Government. I am therefore making arrangements to keep a ship in the ohatt-el-Arab more or less continuously for the next few months. HBW3. mQK TIB TRUC1AL QOA^ Baralml. Abu Dhabi, Detoal. HootAUtlesj. 12. The peace negotiations with the Sheikh of Debai as mediator failed to effect a settlement, war was again declared between Baraimi and Abu ghabi on 17th July. The Sheikh of Debai has definitely thrown in his lot with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. While at Sharjah on 7th August I made further enquiries as to the march of events. The campaign does not appear to have been prosecuted with vigour by either side. Debai is encamped at Jeemi, about a mile from Baraimi, with 300 men. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was at Ofn, about three miles from Baraimi, with 400 men and one gun. None of the other T^ucial Sheikhs shew any enthusiasm for Joining in the struggle, though it is suggested that Ajman is assisting Baraimi Bedouins in their raids into Debai territory. Two of these raids have been successful, camels and a few slaves being carried off. There is little, if any, serious fighting, but raids and counter raids are of frequent occurrence and the casualties on both sides now amount to 60 killed. 13. The Residency Agent is remaining at Gharjah so as to keep more in touch with the situation, he is not hopeful of a peaceful settlement at least before the winter. Baraimi will accept peace without reparation so he thinks, but Abu Dhabi requires reparation for the damaged water wells and date gardens. At the moment the conflict is localised and it is understood that another truce is being arranged through the medium of Kohamed bin Abdulla, Sheikh of the He yai sub tribe from Dhru, who hopes to effect a settlement. • 14. The question of supply may have an effect on this campaign later for the Residency Agent informed me that 270 bacVof foodstuffs have gone already from Debai to Sheikh Saeed’s a my. 15. PiatZANCS visited Hamriyah on 21st July. The Headman, Saif bin Abdullah, who murdered his uncle Abdur Rahman last February, was afraid to visit the ship, but he sent his brother Majid to interview the Commanding Officer. 16. Majid reported thct on 19th July an attempt was made under the direction of Humaid bin Abdur Rahman (son of the late Sheikh) to murder Saif. Two of Humaid’s friends supped. • • •4 supped with Saif and on conclusion of the meal attempted to shoot him* They niesed, the alarm was given and the two men were captured* At the same time Humaid with 40 Bedouins made a demonstration in the town f but realising that the plot had failed he withdrew his men and the would- be murderers were allowed to depart with them* Sharjah - Trouble with the Benljatgbb. 17* The Bedouin Sheikh Mchained bin All of the Beni Kit ebb has picked a quarrel with the dheikh of Sharjah* A relative of the former died recently at Sharjah* The Sheikh took over all the dead man's property in the town* Mohamed bin All claims this property as a near relative and the ;jhelkh is not disposed to admit his claim to it* The Residency Agent has been trying to effect a settlement, but without much success* While I was ashore Isa received a letter from the Beni Kitebb Sheikh refusing to be present at a proposed conference at Ajman unless Isa would guarantee that his demands for blood money will be agreed to* The Bedouins have attempted to raid Sharjah from time to time, but no very serious disturbance is expected to break out in this affair* Uhelkh of Sharjah - Vaxaent Ao JUi;, Uncle KhalMi. 18* Sheikh Sultan is finding difficulty in paying the annuity of 2,800 Rupees to his uncle, the ex-3heikh Khalid* The Residency Agent is trying to persuade Khalid to accept 1,500 Rupees in settlement, in view of the depression and obvious inability of his nephew to pay the full sum* SLAVES. 19* The two alleged slaves mentioned in clause 15 1/^ of my last report of proceedings are still under the eye ' of the Residency Agent, who has written to the Polltioal Resident regarding them* It is Important that once fugitive slaves claim protection on board H*2I* Ships they should not be lost sight of until a decision has been given respecting them* I am not quite certain that the Residency Agent appreciates this point, though I have no reason to suggest that the men are being dealt with in an unusual manner. It has been suggested that one is a free bom Baluchi and has never been a clave, the other is said to be a slave bom in the country of slave parents* 20# There have been some long drawn out negotiations with the dheikh of Abu Dhabi relative to two slaves now in Dalmah Island* I have promised the Residency Agent a ship to take him to Abu Dhabi and then to Dalmah to clear up this outstanding matter. 21* HASTINGS paid a visit to this port on 7th July* The Wall did not return to the subject of Sheikh Saleh of Dibah's intrigues with the Kumaari and Khassab Sheikha* It was mentioned to him that Rashid bln Aimed, thethe Jowaaai Sheikh in Dlbah* had complained that a tax had been extorted from his subjects for fishing ri^its in Russ al Jibal waters. Sheikh Rashid had stated that for twenty years no tax had been levied upon his tribesmen wno had regularly migrated to the fisheries every winter* The Wall declared that this tax was imposed twelve months ago on foreign fishermen by order of the Mascat Government# It amounts to about 1,200 Rupees per annum and is collected by the Bani Badiyah and Kunzari in equal shares on behalf of the Maccat Government. *2. BATTg&amp;L A very large number of visits have been paid to various pearling areas. There is nothing of interest to report from thea except that the catch is moderate as to quality and quantity# There is very little sign on shore of any improvement in the pearl trade, prices are at a lower level than they have been for many years. 23. OMAN APP/a S. The President of the Council and Heir Apparent, Saiyid Sa'id, has been giving further proof of his ability to take firm action. He has now turned his attention to affairs at Sur and Khor Jarama. He took passage in PSNSAHCB and landed at Sur on 9th July with thirty followers. On arrival he informed the assembled Sheikhs and notables that the customs administration in that town was not satisfactory and he announced his intention of laying the foundations of a new customs house at a suitable point inside the creek. The foundation stone was laid without delay and progress on the building was well advanced before he left a week later. Saiyid Sa’id then proceeded to deal with other problems, he collected arrears of customs dues and generally made his presence felt in the neighbourhood. H e p&amp;id. another visit to Sur, taking passage in HASTINGS, between 29th July and 5th August. H e also visited Khor Jararaa to survey the district with a view to establishing a customs and revenue office there. It so happens that I have been in a position to provide him with passages in H#K#£aiips, he has been most appreciative of the service done for him# On my part the Political Agent has been informed that I am prepared to place a ship at Saiyid Sa’id c disposal for passages subject to the exigencies of the Service# This show of ability to t ake firm action and of determination to rule on the part of a young man who has to contend with many difficulties is to be encouraged. x X X X 25 * umsj&amp;A.

The Wali referred to the matter of the appointment of a Permanent Sheikh for Khasab. 71th such a mixture of Kuazara and Beni Eadiyah in the place, the confirmation of Hilal is not generally favoured, and, states the /all, the inhabitants would rather that Muscat appointed a sheikh from outside.

The troubles in the Oman interior - the 'strained relations' between the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Baraimi have already been fully reported. ^ The situation appears to be that while Peace negotiations - with the Sheikh of Debai as intercessor — are in progress no major operations will take place, but Raids and counter- Raids on either sides f Supply Caravans seem quite in order. The Sheikhs of Yangul (Muscat territory) have also been interceding for peace. 'Morale' at Abu Dhabi appears to be high, although the 'War' has seriously handicapped the fitting out and manning of their Pearling Pleet. At all events the fears of the Residency Agent Sharjah of the situation possibly developing into a general struggle between Ghafri and Hinawin (and thus coming through to the Coast) do not appear to be shared by anyone else.

British Legation, Tehran, August 10th, 1931. Reference*- Tehran telegram Ho. 138 dated the 26tli .June, 1931. From the Persian Government No. 16282/682 August 5th, 1931. To the Persian Government, August 10th, 1931. Copies have been sent to the Acting Political ResidentTranelation of a memorandum from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty’s Legation. No. 16282/582 dated LMrdad 13th 1510 (August 5th, 1931). The Ministry for Foreign Affaire have the honour to bring to the notice of th© British Legation thrt according to a report which they have received from Henjam, about sunset on the evening of the 29th Khordad last four slaves escaped from Sharjah and took refuge in the Telegraph house. Mr. Lowe, the official in charge, without any reference to the local officials immediately brought them on board the warship ^Folkestone' 1 , and from there they were transferred to the 'Penaence*, which removed them to a destination unknown. The .iinistry for Foreign Affairs would draw the attention of the Legation to the law of Behmen 18th 1307, which lays down th t as soon as a slave reaches Persian soil or Persian territorial waters he is free; and to the illegal steps taken by the head of the Kenjam Telegraph Station in this matter. It is requested first thrt the Legation take steps to bring about the return of the slaves in question to Persian soil, and secondly that they call upon the head of the Telegraph station to abstain from actions which are outside the scope of his duties.His .utt^esty 1 s Logation present their complinentG to the i Inistry for Foreign Affairs and with reference to the latter's memorandum Ho. 16282/582 of August 5th (; ordad 15th last on the subject of the escape of four slaves to Hcnjam, have the honour to state that the true facts of this oase have already been communicated to the Legation. Briefly, they are as follows: -• r fhc four slaves in question left the Telegraph house and of their own accord took refuge In His Majesty 1 s Sloop 'Folkestone • As the Ministry for Foreign Affaire remarks, they became free, men from the moment when they set foot on Fereian soil, and they acted as free men in proceeding on board one of His Majesty’s Ships. They recognised that in doing so they would be sure of manumission. It is therefore not clear to His Majesty's Legation in what way the Telegraph Clerk has committed an illegal act. The fact that the slaves becuae free by landing on Persian soil implies that they were under no obligation to remain any longer than they wished in Persia. They exercised their own free will by boarding one of His Me jesty's Ships; it can hardly be the intention of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to suggest that in so doing they incurred the slightest risk of losing the freedom which they had acquired. 5. According to information at the disposal of the Legation, the owner of these slaves had pursued them to Henjam, pretending that they were not slaves but divers indebted to him; it was at the request of the owner that the Deputy Governor of Kenjam demanded their surrender tohim # and since it is an invariable practice of the British authorities and British ships to protect and lannurait any slave who may seek refuge with them, it was clearly out of the question for the responsible naval officer to accede in such circumstances to the Deputy Governor’s request. 4. The Persian Govermaent need be in no anxiety as to the manumission and freedom of these slaves. British Legation, Gulhek. August 10th, 19SI.British.

The above named coloured man, who claims to have been born at Kano, as a 3rd class passenger on the s,s, 'Circassia' (Anchor Line) from Bombay. He was in possession of the above Certificate of Identity which states that he is a British subject by birth and is proceeding from Bahrein to Lagos via Bombay. YUSUF is quite destitute and through an interpreter he stated that about eight years ago he left Kano, Northern Nigeria, with his father on a pilgrimage to Mecca but whilst in Arabia they were attacked by robbers who murdered his father and took him prisoner. He was kept as a slave for many years but ik was eventually released or escaped and made his way to Berlin. From there he was sent to Bombay and afterwards placed on board the s,s. 'Circassia' by the Bombay Police, the Captain being Instructed to habd him over to the police at Gibraltar for transhipment to Lagos, the amount of his passage from Gibraltar to Lagos to be recovered from H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrein. On arrival at Gibraltar Yusuf was not allowed to land as there are no sailings from Gibraltar to Lagos, and the Captain then brought him on to Liverpool. YUSUF has been lodged at the African Hostel at the cost of about 3/- a day and Elder Depster &amp; Co. inform me that they are prepared to forward him to Lagos at the special rate of £10,, provided that, in the event of Yusuf being refused a landing at Lagos, a further sum of £10. will be paid to them In respect of his return passage to the U.K. and that their obligations concerning this man will then be at an end. There is I think no doubt that YUSUF was born as stated at Kano, Northern Nigeria, in which case he would appear to be a Protected subject and not British as stated in the Certificate of Identity. I attach the Certificate of Identity and copy of letters from the Bombay and Gibraltar Police regarding the repatriation of Yusuf. Captain Evans, who represents the High Commissioner of India at Liverpool, says it is a case which should be referred to the India Office direct and suggests that the H.O. be so informed. Providing the India Office are prepared to pay the cost of Yusuf’s maintenance and his passage from here to Lagos, he can be repatriated in the s.s.'Appam”, sailing on the 18th instant, at a total cost of about £12.
