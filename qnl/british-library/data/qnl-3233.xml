POLITICAL AGENCY, o Bahrain, the 14th August f^l5. 00 O- V^/L I have the honour to report that the manager„of Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., has approached me with a view to having an increase made in the landing charges authorised for Bahrain# I enclose his statement which shows a loss of Ro.29,889-2-7 incurred between March 1914 and June 1915, but their Bombay Agents make out a loss for this period of Rs.35,282-10-10, the addition probably being due to depre ciation of boats being debited to this fund. Mr# Armour’s first request was that all charges should be raised 50% which he calculated would make in come and expenditure balance in an ordinary year. According to my calculations an increase of 50$ would, in ordinary year, bring in Rs#50,000/- , .which is arproxi- mately one years expenditure calculated in the fimares' of the last 15 months. These figures, however, include certain initial charges and are unnecessarily high ov/ing to the large wages paid at first to Bushiri boatmen. As there is no chance of Shaikh Isa or the mercantile v community o O o 0community agreeing to an all round increase of 50# , I asked 0 Mr. Armour to make propoeals for the revision of the charres on certain articles and for reductions in his expenditure. I enclose a statement of his proposals which should bring in an increase of about 35^. I regret that Mr. Armour is unable to make ,any pro posals for the reduction of expenditure, which seems to he much too high. The large establishment of tally clerks, nakhudas, and .crews of the boats work for about 3 days a week, and by better organization it should be possible to make^appreciable reduction in the establishment. The accounts for landing charges are treated by Messrsi Gray Paul &amp; Co., as accounts of the Persian ' ulf Lighterage Coy., but they do not seem to know if such a company has actually come into existence. In these circumstances I consider that it would be ■best, before undertaking negotiations for raising the land ing charges, to. ascertain the conditions at other ports where the landing is carried out hy Agents of -the British India Steam navigation Company, and the views of that Company with regard to the Lighterage Company.

That the Director of Customs informed Gray 'Paul &amp; Co., on the 19th that their boat*No.2 had landed about 200 bags rice totally damaged from the S.S. M Chyebassa” owing to leakage in &gt; their boat and that the consignees, in consequence, had refused $ '* # to take charge of them. A large numbeh of bags having gave way at the bottom of the boat owing to their being soaked with sea water all the rice containing in those bags got loose in the boat and these rice were lying on the pier^several days. On the 20th I received a complaint signed by several people that part of their cargo was landed by Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; 0o., in a damaged state and that they refuse to take charge of themsr to answer them satisfactorily. They asked me to / , enquire into the matter and to recover their claim. On the 20th Gray Paul &amp; Co., was asked the cause of damage to o the cargo and requested them to take charge of it. Gray Paul replied that owing to strong wind the boat rolled and the sea water washed over the boal? near the rock called ’’Pashto that the nakhuda at once signalled for help and that they had sent another boat for salvage. They said the Landing Coy., was not responsible for the damages. On the 21st Gray Paul asked me to instruct the Import Yard Manager to take charge of the damaged goods and to deliver them to the consignees under a remark. They said the British India Coy., or the Landing Coy were not responsible for damages caused by sea or any accident. On the 22nd the Director of Customs was asked to inform me \ the usual system of working under similar circumstances and also the cause of damages. The Director of Customs informed me l^hat, when a few bags of Tice I 0x o' rioe are damaged through inadvertently, the consignees do taka' ’ charge of them hut in the present instance the damages were due, • / ^i- 3 opinion, to leaking or over loading the boat and so' the Landing Coy., is responsible. He says that they never take charge of torn rice bags or loose rice but those bags that are in good condition although the contents are slightly damaged they will take them into the warehouse and deliver them to the consignees. The question is whether there was strong, wind and high sea so as to cause a big lighter to roll and take water. On the morning of 18th I attended office and found the sea slightly rough and wind moderate but by noon the wind had drop ped and sea was calm. I actually went out in the afternoon boating on that date. I think the evidence of Mr. Maharaj, Director of Customs, should be taken as he had watched the unloading of damaged cargo. There seemed to have been leakage in the boat No.2 as this boat was, on the following day beached and repaired. I inspected the damaged rice on the 23rd with Mirza Ismail in charge of Gray Paul &amp; Co., and Director of Customs and asked the former that all torn bags of rice and loose rice should be taken charge of by him, and damaged rice bags in good order by the latter.

To lessre Gray, Paul &amp; Company, B A H R A I H. .^ir, I have the honour to refer to our various conversations A A A regarding the possibility of arranging for an increase of the landing charges in force in Bahrain, and to say that I learn ! N • ) ' with great regret of the continued loss at which the landing arrangements have been worked up to date. In 19 25 the same uestion was raised by one of your pre decessors and in September of that year -ajor Trevor, who was then acting for the ilon’ble the Resident in the Persian Gulf and was Political Agent here when the landing s were con cluded, stated that he had several times been told that you would be quite prepared to run the business at a loss rather than allow thenold system to continue, in order,to save the dead loss which was incurred weekly in delays to steamers; he was of opinion that the large savings due to the prompt clearance given to steamers should bo set off against the loer incurred in connection with the landing arrangements., In any case, T do not think the question of an increase in b the landing chargee couM be taken up with the Shaikh of Bahrain with any chance of success, as I have recently had the opportu nity of ascertaining that another Agent, who works with a similar -agreement to yours, makes a regular profit on landing cargo from hie steamers. This is possible as h© hires boats when he requires them, and has to meet no expenses of upkeep. Tii© Shaikh in commercial matters always consults his merchants, and botn they and the abovemontioned Agent would undoubtedly make common cause, using the fact of his profits to oppose an increase and to raise an outcry against an attempt to impose a burden on the Bahrain public to benefit a British firm. In these l n &lt;ri -r* ^ 'ko O 1 t • V \ r&gt; circumstances an increase coul^ on’Vy be forced on the * Ehailh / a course which it is manifestly impoesiblo to adopt. Apart from the heavy Iqss due to the diGorganisatioh of tr^de owing to th© war, considerable expenditure was incurred at tne outset by hiring^at an high rate in order to get the landing arrangements started quickly, and at first t*ie recurring chargee on account of wages amounted to an unduly large sum, but since then economies have been effected and it seems that tA© monthly expenses of working the landing arrangements on the return of normal times will be approximately as follows:- Hopairs .ft? 450/- Depreciation. ” 340 /- Wage© o ’ boatmen.^ 1,000/- Extra men for/boats..250/- Coolies ” 400/- Tally Clerks etc M 700/- Taily books w * 30 /- Royalty paid to Shaikh'* 110/- 3,280/- During th© period Larch, 29 14^ to June, *39 15, the average monthly earnings were R-.2, B?/-, but from August, 19 U, onwards trade was affected by the war; in fact for the year ending Larch 3 1st, 19 35, the imports of general merchandise had dropped 44.4 » per cent, and, while there was a considerable improvement by th© end of the BUbse^ient year, it would, I think, be safe to assume 9 that, if war had not broken out, the figure E?.2, 267A would have been at least 30 per cent higher, that is 1-2,817/- leaving a ’ . : deficit of k:.463/- a month. I 'understand tiiat th© British India £ team i^nviga11 on Co .Ltd. and hessrs Turner, V.orrison and Company utd., have a friendly arrangement as regards th© sailings of their respective ships to th© Persian Gulf, and I venture to suggest that it might be possible to arrange that # the Agent of the latter line should be instructed to employ your boats, in which case a single monthly call by one of their ships would make up the deficit. I fear, however, that, until peace is restored, there is little or nothing which can be done* to decrease your losses, unless, as the British India 8team navigation Company Ltd is at present unable to send ships to Bahrain, you would undertake the landing of cargo from the steamers of rival lines, though I do not think &lt; .that this would prove a gcvod policy in the long run.
