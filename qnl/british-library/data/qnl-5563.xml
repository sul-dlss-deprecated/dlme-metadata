WAKEFIELD’S REPORT ON ECONOMIC AND TRADE CODITIONS IN THE BAHRAIN ISLANDS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 1942. (A) General Description. ''he total population is estimated at about ^^,000. Trade—General Condition. Tbe total value of trade for the year, excluding imports and exports of petroleum, of oil equipment for the Bahrain Petroleum Company and of supplies for the Services was Rs. 5,68^03,110 as compared with Rs. 4,77,49,030 in 1942—43. It shows an increase in imports of Rs. 1,04,66,420 and decrease in exports of Rs. 14,12,340. Of the total imports and exports for the year under review, 24|% and 56% respectively were of specie, notes, gold and gold coins, the figures for which for the last two years are as follows Imports — 1942-43; 1943-44. Specie and notes , , 99,71,090 93,15,660 Gold coins . , 47,930 94,020 Total . . 1,00,19,020 94,09,680 Exports — Specie and notes . . 78.18,530 1,01,98,030 Gold coins . . , . 2,70,840 3,14,160 Total . 80,89,370 1,05,12,190 It shows a decrease in imports of Rs. 6,09,340 and in exports an increase of Rs. 24,22,820. Omitting the articles mentioned in the previous paragraph the value of imports and exports for thelast two years has been as follows 1942-43, 1943-44- Imports ..... 1,80,28,990 2,91,04,750 Exports 1,16,11,650 77,76,400 These figures which include considerable tranship ment and re-export cargoes, show an increase in the value of imports of Rs. 1,10,75,760 and a decrease in the value of exports by Rs. 38,35,160. Sources of trade.— principal source of Bah rain’s imports is India whose share of the total imports decreased by 14% as compared with 1942- 43. The shares f the United Kingdom and United States of Amerka on the other hand shoved a decrease of 3% and an increase of 588% respec tively. Imports from Arabia show an increase of 30%. The increase in the value of trade cannot how ever be attributed to an all round improvement in trade, but was due to an increased quantity of imports by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and of cereals by the U.K.C.C. I here was however a distinct improvement in local trade between Persia and Bahrain. (B) Finanical— Tightness a? Money. Money remained extremely tight during the yeat 1943-44. Indian Funds were being sold in the bazar at 4% discount until the beginning of 1944 when the rate fell to 1£% discount. Exchange.— The average sterling-rupee rate of exchange for the year was Rs. 1,338 per £ 100. Harvest — The date crop was unusually good. During the year under report there was an increase of cultivation of vegetables by small holders. Industry — The pearl catch was a little less than the previous year. Due to activity on the Indian market prices of low'er grade pearls rose consider ably over 1942— 43 prices. Development of mines —The figures below will give some idea of the development of the oil fields :— Quantity of oil shipped from Bahrain for the fiscal year ended 31st March 1944— 1,095 844.346 tons, Total production of oil for the same period— 882,923'626 tons. Quantity of crude oil received from Arabia and refined in Bahrain-- 685,103- 299 tons. (E) Air Service. The British Overseas Airways Corporation are maintaining six services weekly both east and west, carrying passengers, mails and a quantity of cargo. Shipping and navigation.— There is an increase of 110% over pre-war rates of freight between Karachi and Persian Gulf ports, The freight charges in respect of general cargo were as follow'' Bahrain to Karachi 29 rupees per ton. Bahrain to Bombay 29-8-0 rupees per ton, Bahrain to Basra 25 rupees per ton. Bahrain to Persian Gulf ports Rs. 32-8-0 per ton. Lighterage — There are a number of sea-goinrr dhows with cargo capacity of up to 40 tons each! There is a marked increase in the craft available in this area. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Co., Ltd., Bahrain had ten steel barges with average capacity of about 180 tons during the period under review. Moreover the British Indian Steam Navigation Company maintained twelve cargo boats with an average capacity of about 25 to 30 tons. C3-&lt;^ 2 Stale of the roads.- The surfaced roads which comprise at least half the total number of roads are in poor condition. During the year under review the following vehicles were registered (Military vehicles excepted). Light cars .. 342 Buses 53 Lorries .. no Social— Standard of living — The standard of living remains low. An increase in wage rates barely offset a slight rise in the cost of living. Employment .— At the end of the year under report there were 2,286 Bahrain subjects and about 800 other Asiatics in the employ of the Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd., Bahrain, in addition to 181 Europeans and Americans. Public health and hygiene.— Muharraq was attack ed by a minor outbreak of small-pox in the fir.^l quarter of 1944. The Bahrain Government Med™ cal Department carried out a further 1,200 vacci nations. Usual Quarantine precautions were ob served and the epidemic was countered. Taxation.—A house rent control law was intro duced by the Bahrain Government and the general tendency of rents to rise was in some degree counteracted, .TABLE B. II—EXPORTS.— contd.

But for the control of exports from India, inaugurated soon after the war, trade wouiu have oeen larger. Imports of cotton piece goods from England and India have uecreaseu, whiue those from Japan have increasea. The main reason for this is that the Japanese copy almost all British designs at a considerably xower price. The Bahrein Petroleum Co.Ltd. produced 1,007,739.075 tons of oils. Crude oil received from Arabia and refined by the Company amounted to 527,479^828 tons. ft 6&lt;tf E.&amp;.0.Seer For information.

SURE IN in DIa' FOREIGN SECRETARY’S LETTER f ^ ATE , received 39 *6- 4 13-6-194)Report on the Economic and Trade Islands for the year Conditions on the Bahrain 1939 - 40 . Introduction .—This report should be read in con junction with the Trade Report for the year ending the 31st March 1939. 2. Trade .—The total value of trade, excluding oils, for the year under review amounted to Rs. 3,51,35,260 (Imports Rs. 2,21,59,030: Exports Rs. 1,29,76,230) as compared with Rs. 4,81,70,220 (Imports Rs. 2,73,26,230 : Exports Rs. 2,08,43,990) in the previous year, showing a decrease of Rs. 1,30,34,960. In order to obtain a true indica tion of the trend of trade the value of direct tran shipments and re-exports from bond should be excluded from these figures. Total value of tran shipment cargoes and cargoes re-exported from bond amounted to Rs. 66,11,600 and Rs. 57,64,180 respectively. The true trade values are, therefore, as follows :— 1938-39. 1939-40. Rs. Rs. Imports . . 1,38,84,730 1,55,47,430 Exports . . 74,02,490 72,12,050 Imports show an increase of Rs. 16,62,700 as compared with a decrease of Rs. 20,05,140 during 1938-39. Exports on the other hand show a decline of Rs. 1,90,440 as compared with an increase of Rs. 83,500 during 1938-39. The value of transhipment cargoes was consi derably less than that of last year, owing, firstly : to the completion of constructional work at Dhaman and secondly: to the development of the port of Has Tanura. The increase in the true value of imparts is due mainly to certain merchants having imported large stocks in anticipation of war and consequent con trol of exports from other countries. 3. It will be noticed that imports from India increased from Rs. 63,97,900 in 1938-39 to Rs. 74,54,190 in the year under report. Merchants were turned to the Indian market by the delay and difficulty in obtaining stocks from Europe. The control of exports from India, inaugurated soon after the war, prevented still larger increases in this trade. Exports to India have decreased from Rs. 17,63,650 last year to Rs. 10,86,020 in the year under report. 4. The total value of imports of cotton piecegoods from England to Bahrain has decreased from Rs. 4,42,500 in 1932-33 to Rs. 1,63,000 in the current year; imports of the same material from India have also decreased from nearly 7 lakhs in 1932-33 to Rs. 4| lakhs in 1939-40. On the other hand, imports from Japan have increased from Rs. b\ lakhs in 1932-33 to just under Rs. 15 lakhs jn 1939-40. The main reason for this unfortunate diversion of trade is that it is possible to obtain a Japanese copy of almost ail British designs of cotton piecegoods at a considerably lower price. A comparative table of imports from England, India and Japan in Textiles and Fabrics from 1932-33 to 1939-40 is given below :—• TABLE I. 1932-33 1933-34 1934-35 1935-36 1936-37 1937-38 1938-39 1939-40 Rs.

Taxation .—Private property is free from taxation but there are municipal taxes in the towns of Manama and Muharraq. A considerable pro portion of the total State income is derived from Oil Royalties, and most of the balance comes from Customs duties. The Customs tariff is fixed at 5 per cent, ad valorem on general merchandise and 10 per cent, on certain luxury articles such as carpets, gillims, cycles, clocks and watches, electrical goods, furniture, gramophones, gold and artificial gold thread, hosiery, henna, motor cars, perfumery, toilet soaps, silken goods, sewing machines, rubber tvres and tubes, typewriters, boots, and shoes, playing cards, etc. Alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes pay 15 per cent. duty. Transit dues on goods landed at Bahrain for the mainland are charged at If per cent, and export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle is paid on hides and two annas per basket on dates. The Customs Department is under the direction of an European Director of Customs, who is an official of the Bahrain Government. 13. Agriculture .—The area of Bahrain is roughly 138.000 acres, of which roughly 1/12th is cultivable and l/20th is at present under cultivation. The principal crops grown are dates and lucerne. As a result of greatly increased demand, more attention is now being paid to the cultivation of vegetables. 14. Industry .—Bahrain is famous throughout the world for its pearl industry on which great numbers of people still depend for their livelihood. Unfor tunately this industry has been in decline in recent years. The possibility of initiating a mother-of- pearl industry should be explored. 15. Mines .—The Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd., now owns a fully developed oil field. A very modern refinery, capable of dealing with over 25.000 barrels of oil daily, has been working steadily to full capacity. 16. Communications and transport .—Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist over most of the two main islands. There are 281 motor cars, 115 buses, 90 lorries of various types and 35 motor cycles, which are almost exclusively of American manufacture. Motor boats ply regularly between Bahrain, Qatif and ’Oqair and occasionally to other ports on the mainland. The fares are cheap. There is a regular weekly steamer service (British India Steam Navigation Company) from and to India and Iraq. This Company’s fast mail also calls at Bahrain weekly. In addition the Strick, Silver Java Pacific and Mitsui lines main tain regular services from British, American and Japanese ports. The British Overseas Airways halt at Bahrain on their east and west bound flights. 17. General. —Manamah, the capital town, con tains three hospitals, three schools and a technical school, a Post Office maintained by the Indian Postal Department, a wireless and cable station, and a branch of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company, Limited, who act as agents for the British fndia Steam Navigation Company, Limited. There are municipal councils in Muharraq and Manama. There is an electric power station at Manamah and power is carried along the causeway and by submarine cable to Muharraq. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and mainland affairs, will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United Kingdom through the Department of Overseas Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence, Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary matters is available in his records. Sd. R. G. E. W. ALBAN, Major, Political Agent, Bahrain.

IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S LETTER NO, DATE RECEIVED 59 28-5 6 -4-1940,Report on the Economic and Trade Conditions on the Bahrain Islands for the year 1938-39. Introduction .—Please see the Trade Report for the year ending the 31st March 1938. Trade .—The total value of trade, excluding oils, for the year under review amounted to Rs. 4,81,70,220 (imports Rs. 2,73,26,230 p/ws exports Rs. 2,08,43,990) as compared with Rs. 3,25,63,800 (imports Rs. 2,05,67,370 plus exports Rs. 1,19,96,430) in the previous year showing an increase of Rs. 4,56,06,420 or 47-9 per cent. In order to obtain a true indication of the trend of trade the value of direct transhipments of large consignments of build ing and other materials, machinery, motor cars, hard ware and cutlery and specie to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, A1 Khobar, Saudi Arabia, and the value of re-exports from bond must be excluded from these figures. The value of direct transhipment cargoes and cargoes re-exported from bond amounted to Rs. 1,34,41,500 for the year under review and Rs. 46,77,500 for the previous year, and the true trade values therefore become as follows:— 1937-38. 1938-39. Rs. Rs. Imports . . . 1,58,89,870 1,38,84,730 Exports . . . 73,18,930 74,02,490 Imports show a decline of Rs. 20,05,140, which has been intensified by the fall in prices of some of the principal food commodities.

The bazaar became over-stocked and imports therefore dropped. The decrease in the quantity of imported wheat is offset by the in crease in the imports of flour and a falling off of the trade with Iran is responsible for the smaller imports of loaf sugar and crystal sugar. Imports from India have decreased from Rs. 70,56,710 to Rs. 62,97,900 or by 9-3 per cent, but the general tendency towards the lowering of wholesale prices on cotton piece-goods is allowing Indian production to compete more favourably with the Japanese. Exports show an increase of Rs. 83,560 which would have been greater if last year’s improvement in the pearl trade had been maintained. The last season for the pearl industry was bad from all points of view and the value of exports amounted to only Rs. 4,37,400 against Rs. 6,12,400 for the previous year. Over a million tons of oil were produced and over 8,15,000 tons were exported by the Bahrain Petro leum Company, Limited, during the year. Imports of oil from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company included 2,17,226 gallons of kerosene, 1,28,730 gallons of petrol and 2,70,520 gallons of aviation spirit of which 1,04,330, 61,020 and 2,700 gallons respectively were re-exported to Arabia and Persia.

A very considerable proportion of the total wages earned is of course spent in Bahrain. There is a branch of the Eastern Bank Limited in Bahrain which transacts all types of business. The hundi system is used by the Hindu merchants. Taxation. —Private property is free from taxation but there are municipal taxes in the towns of Manama and Muharraq. A considerable proportion of the total State income is derived from Oil Royalties, and most of the balance comes from Customs duties. The Customs tariff is fixed at 5 per cent, ad valorem on general merchandise and 10 per cent, on certain luxury articles such as carpets, gillims, cycles, clocks and watches, electrical goods, furniture, gramo phones, gold and artificial gold thread, hosiery, henna, motor cars, perfumery, toilet soaps, silken goods, sewing machines, rubber tyres and tubes, typewriters, boots and shoes, playing cards, etc. Alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes pay 15 per cent. duty. Transit dues on goods landed at Bahrain for the mainland are charged at If per cent, and export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle is paid on hides and two annas per basket of dates. The Customs Department is under the direction of an European Director of Customs, who is an official of the Bahrain Government. Agriculture. —The area of Bahrain is roughly 1,38,000 acres, of which roughly l/12th is cultivable and l/20th is at present under cultivation. The principal crops grown are dates and lucerne. As a result of greatly increased demand, more attention is now being paid to the cultivation of vegetables. Industry. —Bahrain is famous throughout the world for its pearl industry, on which great numbers of people still depend for their livelihood. During the diving season, which is from June to September, Bahrain is visited by numerous Indian and Arab pearl merchants and also by one or two European pearl merchants. The possibilities of the mother-of-pearl industry deserves attention. Mines. —The Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limited, now owns a fully developed oil field, which in 1938 produced over a million tons of crude oil. A very modern refinery, capable of dealing with over 25,000 barrels of oil daily, is in full operation. Communications and Transport. —Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist over most of the two main islands. There are 316 motor cars, 80 buses, 71 lorries of various types and 18 motor cycles, which are almost exclusively of American manufacture. Motor boats ply regularly between Bahrain, Qatif and ‘Oqair and occasionally to other ports on the mainland. The fares are cheap. There is a regular weekly steamer service (British India Steam Navigation Company) from *and to India and Iraq. This Company’s fast mail also calls at Bahrain fortnightly. Ih addition the Strick, Hansa, Silver Java Pacific and Mitsui lines maintain regular services from British, Continental, American and Japanese ports. The Imperial Airways halt at Bahrain five times weekly on their east and west bound flights. General. —Manamah, the capital town contains two hospitals (shortly to be increased to three), three schools and a technical school, a Post Office maintained by the Indian Postal Department, a wireless and cable station, and a branch of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company', Limited, who act as agents for the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited. There are municipal councils in Muharraq and Manama. There is an electric power station at Manamah and power is carried along the causeway and by submarine cable to Muharraq. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and mainland affairs, will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from mer chants in the United Kingdom through the Depart ment of Overseas Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence, Calcutta. Time probably would be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary matters is available in his records. Sd/- H. WEIGHTMAN. Political Agent, Bahrain. Attested. R.

You will be quite safe therefore in informing the Japanese Embassy that there is no published trade report for Bahrain. We should have no objection, however, to your calling their attention to the information published in the Indian Trade Journal if you consider it desirable to do so. ihe Journal is accessible to the Japanese Consul-General at Calcutta and has probably been seen oy him.External Affairs Department, (J$ The 193 . - 2 - 1 9:59 J 4.

Financial. —The present prosperity which is re flected in the increased trade of Bahrain, is due almost solely to the operations of the Bahrain Petro leum Company, which employs (in round numbers) 370 Europeans and Americans, 450 Asiatic foreigners and 2,360 Bahrainis. A very considerable propor tion of the total wages earned is of course spent in Bahrain. There is a branch of the Eastern Bank Limitec^^ in Bahrain which transacts all types of business^F The hundi system is used by the Hindu merchants. Taxation. —Private property is free from taxation but there are municipal taxes in the towns of Mana- mah and Muharraq. A considerable proportion of the total State income is derived from Oil Royal ties, and most jof the balance comes from Customs duties. The Customs tariff is fixed at 5 per cent. ad valorem on general merchandise and 10 per cent, on certain luxury articles such as carpets, gillims, cycles, clocks and watches, electrical goods, furniture, gramophones, gold and artificial gold thread, hosiery, henna, motor cars, perfumery, toilet soaps, silken goods, sewing machines, rubber tyres and tubes, typewriters, boots and shoes, playing cards, etc. Alcohol tobacco and cigarettes pay 15 per cent. duty. Transit dues on goods landed at Bahrain for the mainland are charged at If per cent, and export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle is paid on hides and 2 annas per basket of dates, f The Customs Department is under the direction of an European Director of Customs, who is an official of the Bahrain Government. Agriculture. —The area of Bahrain is roughly 138,000 acres, of which roughly l/12th is cultivable and l/20th is at present under cultivation. The principal crops grown are dates and lucerne. As a result of greatly increased demand, more attention is now being paid to the cultivation of vegetables. An Agricultural Expert lent by the Government of India recently visited Bahrain and his Report and recommendations are at present awaited. /wdusO-y.—Bahrain is famous throughout the world for its pearl industry, on which great numbers of its people still depend for their livelihood. Dur ing the diving season, which is from June to Sep tember, Bahrain is visited by numerous Indian and Arab pearl merchants and also by one or two Euro pean pearl merchants. The possibilities of the development of a mother- of-pearl industry deserve attention. J/ines.—The Bahrain Petroleum Company now owns a fully developed oil field, which in 1937 pro duced over a-million tons of crude oil. A very modern Refinery, capable of dealing with over 25,000 barrels of oil daily, is now in full operation. Communications and Transport.—Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist over most of the two main islands. There are 261 motor cars, 71 buses and 78 lorries of various types, which are almost exclusively of American manufacture. Moto*3 boats ply regularly between Bahrain and Qatif and Oqair and occasionally to other ports on the mainland. The fares are cheap.

Japan still continues to hold a predominant share of the Bahraini market and the effect of this competition in relation to British trade is noted in Table III. The addresses of the principal importers and exporters of the articles concerned have been inserted beelow the Table. Russian trade is non-existent.5 Daring the past few years Japanese imports have increased considerably. They are steadily ousting British imports of cotton, woollen, real and imitation silk, yarn hosiery and haberdashery, toys, electrical goods, rubber goods, shoes and glassware. The goods imported from Japan were of inferior quality but found a ready sale due to their cheapness. Imports from England, particularly in the textile, cotton and silk trade, have decreased correspondingly. It may be stressed that a factor which favours Japanese trade is that Japanese merchants not only visit Bahrain to examine all possible avenues of trade but are willing to import goods into Bahrain on their own account and dispose of them to local mer chants as opportunity offers. British fiims and merchants could do worse than emulate them. Financial. —The prosperity of the people depends mainly on the pearling trade, which is far from flourishing and which in turn reflects adversely on all other trade. There is a branch of the Eastern Bank Limited at Bahrain which transacts all classes of business. The Hindu system is used by the Hindu mer chants. Taxation. Private property is free from taxa tion. The income of the State is derived from the revenues collected from Customs duties. The tariff is fixed by treaty at 5 per cent, ad valorem on general merchandise, and 10 per cent, is levied on certain articles of luxury such as carpets, gillims, cycles, clocks and watches, electrical goods, furniture, gramophones, gold and artifi cial gold thread, hosiery, henna, motor cars, perfumery toilet soap, silken goods, sewing machines, tyres and tubes, typewriters, boots and shoes, playing cards, and 15 per cent, on alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes. Transit dues on goods landed at Bahrain for the mainland was reduced from 2 per cent, to If per cent; and an export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The Customs work is under the direction of a European Director of Customs under the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. M27EAD Agriculture. —The area of Bahrain is roughly 138,(XX) acres, of which l/12th is cultivable and l/2()th under cultivation. The remaining being rocky ground is unsuitable. The principal corps are dates and a variety of vegetables. Industry - Bahrain is famous throughout the world for its pearl industry, on which the greater proportion of the people depend for a livelihood. During the season Bahrain is visited by numerous Indian and Arab and a few European pearl mer chants. Boat building and the manufacture of sails is another important industry in Bahrain. Two local firms, viz., Messrs. A.'M. Yateem Brothers and Haji Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo hold Agencies for ' Thornycroft ” and “ Kelvin ” engines for steam launches. This industry is capable of further expansion, if well organized. Other industries are : reed mats, date cultiva tion and there are great possibilities of the shell industry being centralized in Bahrain. Mines. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limited, a subsidiary company of the Standard Oil Company Limited of California, have found oil and are actively engaged in developing their concession. Communications and Transport. —Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist over the northern part of the Island. There are about 200 cars and 25 lorries of various types of which 90 per cent, are of American manufacture. Motor boats ply regularly between Bahrain and Qatif and Oqair and occasionally to Kuwait and Dubai. The fares are cheap. There is a regular weekly steamer service (British India Steam Navigation Company) from and to India and Iraq. The East and West bound aeroplanes of Imperial Airways, Limited, call bi-weekly. The air service is used also for commercial freight. Social. —The discovery of oil promises to im prove the economic condition of the people. The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, has pro vided some relief to unemployment and work in the oil-field is a great attraction for emigrants from, India and other neighbouring countries6 There is a community of about 200 Europeans and Americans including members of the Arabian Mission Owing to little or no suitable accommodation being available, especially for European ladies, a number of requests for permission to land at Bahrain have had to be refused. Manamah, the capital town contains two hospitals, four schools (two for boys and two for girls), Post office, a Wireless and Cable station and a branch office of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited, wffio also act as agents of the Imperial Airways, Limited.

Dated 2 6 dj{_. ISos- Reoeivp. 1 3 ^ ^34 jTrade Report of the Bahrain Islands for the year ended the 31st March 1933. Introduction .—The Independent Arab Principality of Bahrain consists of a group of islands off the East Coast of Arabia and is under British protection. A general description of the physical and commer cial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the Report for the year 1911-12 (Annual Series No. 5052). The permanent population is estimated at 115,000. Trade .—The total value of trade for the year amounted to Rs. 1,58,66,570 as compared with Rs. 1,85,11,850 in 1931-32, showing a decrease of Rs. 26,45,280 or 14-28 per cent. The decrease is chiefly due to the world-wide fall in prices of com modities and to the lack of ready money, due to the slump in the pearl trade ; actual imports have decreased and the market for better classes of goods is at a standstill. Further, since pearls are a luxury and are only bought when other wants have been satisfied, the depression is being more acutely felt in Bahrain than elsewhere, since it is almost entirely dependent on the pearl trade for a living. Imports .—The total value of imports amounts to Rs. 97,72,360 as against Rs. 1,11,34,650 in 1931-32, showing a decrease of Rs. 13,62,290 or 12-23 per cent. The table given hereunder shows the move ments of general merchandise as compared with the pearls and specie :— — 1931-32 1932-33 Per cent of increase or decrease. Rs. Rs.

Exports .—The total value of exports amounted to Rs. 60,94,210 as against Rs. 73,77,200 in 1931-32, showing a decrease of Rs. 12,82,990 or 17-39 per cent.

Customs .—The Tariff is fixed by Treaty at 5 per cent ad valorem on general merchandise and 10 per cent duty is levied on certain articles of luxury, such as Carpets, Gillims, Cycles, Clocks and watches, Electrical goods, Furniture, Gramophones, Golden and artificial golden threads, Hosiery, Henna, Motor cars, Perfumery, Toilet soap, Silken goods, Sewing machines, Tyres and tubes, Typewriters, Boots and shoes, Playing cards, and 15 per cent on Alcohol and Tobacco and cigarettes. In June 1920, on the advice of the Government of India, the tax on goods landed at Bahrain in transit to the mainland was reduced from 5 per cent to 2 per cent at which figure it formerly stood. Export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The Customs work is carried on by an European Director of Customs under the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. Banks .—A branch of the Eastern Bank exists at Bahrain and transacts all classes of business. The Hundi system is also used by the Hindu merchants. Oils and Minerals .—The Bahrain Petroleum Com pany, Limited, a subsidiary Company of the Standard Oil Company, Limited, of California, have found oil and are actively engaged in developing their conces sion.2 Enquiries regarding Trade. —The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and main land affairs, will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United King dom made through the Department of Overseas Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by address ing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary matters is available in his records. Shipping. —There is a regular weekly steamer mail service from and to India and Iraq. The East and West bound aeroplanes of Imperial Airways, Limited, call weekly. General Remarks. —Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist over the greater part of the Islands. There are about 100 motor cars of various makes, and motor cars are available for hire. Motor boats ply regularly between Bahrain and Qatif and ’Oqair, and occasionally to Kuwait and Dibai. G. LOCH, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.13 TABLE A-B-EXPORTS.

The present report has been delayed and is now more than a year out of date. The hope expressed in t he previous submission that the figures of trade for 1932-33 would at last show some improvement, has not been fulfilled and the year 1932-33 appears to have been quite the worst in the recent history of Bahrein.

Copies of the report have been despatched to the Foreign Office, London, and to the Hon’ble the Political Resident at Bushire. / i fl!B Trade Report of the Bahrain Islands for the year ended the 3 I st March 1932. Introduction. —The Independent Arab Principality of Bahrain consists of a group of islands off the East coast of Arabia. The State is under British protection but is not a protectorate. A general description of the physical, political and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the Report for the year 1911-1912 (Annual Series 5052). The permanent population is estimated at 115,000. Trade .—The total value of trade for the year amounted to £1,369,720 as compared with £1,691,558 in 1930-31, showing a decrease of £321,838 or 19'02 per cent. This decrease is chiefly due to the World wide fall in prices of commodities and to the lack of ready money, due to the slump in the pearl trade ; actual imports have decreased and the market for better class goods is at a standstill. Further, since pearls are a luxury and are only bought when other wants have been satisfied the depression is being more acutely felt in Bahrain than elsewhere, since it is almost entirely dependent on the pearl trade for a living. Imports. —The total value of Imports amounted to £821,824 as against £1,087,524 in 1930-31, showing a decrease of £265,700 or 24-43 per cent. The table given hereunder shows the movements of general merchandise as compared with pearls and specie. — 1930-31. 1931-32. Per cent of increase or decrease. Pearls ....

A considerable quantity of the textiles shown as imported from India are actually of Japanese origin and this point must be borne in mind. British imports benefited from the departure from the gold standard, but Japan’s departure Jfrom the gold standard to all intents and purposes neutralized this advantage. Exports. —The total value of Exports amounted to £547,896 as against £604,034 in 1930-31, showing a decrease of £56,138 or 10-24 per cent. The follow ing table shows the movements of general merchan dise as compared with pearls, specie and gold coins. — 1930-31. 1931-32. Per cent of increase or decrease. Pearls .... Specie and DoUars .

This activity in the export of gold is chiefly due to its rise in value consequent on the abandonment of the gold standard by Great Britain and India. The gold comprised not only coins but ornaments of all kinds and the opportunity was taken to dispose at a profit of the hoardings of years. Since many pearls leaving Bahrain are not declared and very few declared at their correct value, it is impossible to give exact figures for their export but the amount is variously estimated at between one-and-a-half and 2 million pounds in a good year. Last year the value fell far short of this amount. Pearl Industry. —A general description of this industry is given in this Agency Trade Report for the year 1927-28. Customs. —The Tariff is fixed by Treaty at 5 per cent ad valorem on all imports. In June 1920 on the advice of the Government of India the tax on goods landed at Bahrain in transit to the mainland was reduced from 5 per cent to 2 per cent at which figure it formerly stood. Export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The Customs work is carried on by a European Director of Customs under the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. Banks. —A branch of the Eastern Bank exists at Bahrain and transacts all classes of business and the Hundi system is also used by the Hindu mer chants. This bank is also the State bank of the Bahrain Government. Oils and Minerals. —The Bahrain Petroleum Com pany Limited, a subsidiary company of the Standard Oil Company Limited of California has been prospec ting for oil in Bahrain. They have put down a test bore and though traces of gas have been met no oil has hitherto been discovered in commercial quantities. Enquiries regarding trade. —The political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and main land affairs, will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United Kingdom through the Board of Overseas Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by ad dressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary matters is available in his records. Shipping .—-There is now a regular weekly mail service from and oo India and ’IRAQ. Ge'neral remarks. —Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist over the greater part of the Islands. There are about 200 motor cars of various makes and motor cars are available for hire. Motor boats ply regularly between Bahrain and Qatar on the mainland and also between Bahrain and Qatif and Ojair, and occasionally to Kuwait and Dubai. C. G.

Bushire, 20th April, 1932. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have received a request from the Political Agent, Bahrain, for permission to submit the figures incorporated in his Annual Trade Report in Rupees instead of in Sterling as has heretofore been the practice. 2. In view of the fact that the Rupee is the unit of currency employed at all places on the southern littoral of the Gulf and that conversion into sterling may frequently lead to discrepancies owing to fluctuations of exchange and possible errors of calculations, apart from the not inconsiderable labour involved, I would propose to authorise the Political Agent, Bahrain, to submit the figures for his report for 1931/32 and subsequent years in rupees, and, for the sake of uniformity, instruct the Political Agents at Kuwait and Muscat to do likewise. Before doing so, however, I should be glad to be informed if serious objections are seen to the adoption of this course. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) K.H.Gastrell. for Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Secretary of State,Letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain, No. 817, dated 7th July 1931. . I have the honour to forward herewith a report on the Trade and Commerce of the Bahrain Islands for the year ended 31st March 1931 and to request that you will be good | enough to furnish this office with twenty-four printed copies. Copies of the report have been despatched to the Foreign Office, London, and toReport on the Trade of the Bahrain Islands for the year ended 3 1 st March 1931. Introduction. The Independent Arab Principality of Bahrain consists of a group of islands off the East coast of Arabia. The State is under British protection but is not a protectorate. A general description of the physical, political and comnaercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the Report for the year 1911-12 (Annual Series No. 5052). The permanent population is estimated at 115,000. Trade. The total value of the trade amounted to £1,691,558 as compared with £2,818,257 in 1929-30, showing a decrease of £1,126,699 or_39\9 per cent. The total value of Imports amounted to £1,087,524 as against £1,930,692 in 1929-30, showing a decrease of £843,168 or 43/7 per cent. The decrease is chiefly due to the worldwide fall in prices of com modities but owing to the tightness of ready money and the slump in the pearl trade actual imports have decreased and the market for better class goods is at a stand-still. Since pearls are a luxury, and are only bought when other wants have been satisfied, the depres sion has been felt acutely in Bahrain, which is almost entirely dependent on the pearl trade for a living. It will be seen that Cotton goods valued at £79,938 are shown as imported from India. This is mis leading as the bulk of the cargo imported from the United Kingdom arrives via India and conse quently appears under this heading, and also a quantity of Japanese piecegoods. Pearl Industry. A general description of this Industry is given in this Agency Trade Report for the year 1927-28. Exports. The total value of Exports during the year amount ed to £604,034 as against £887,565 in 1929-30 showing a decrease of £283,531 or 3T9 per cent.

IBS 1 -eiveo 1 8 MAY. 1931 IReport on the Trade of the Bahrain Islands for the year ending 31st March 1930. Introduction. The independent Arab Principality of Bahrain consists of a group of islands off the East Coast of Arabia. The State is under British protection but is not a protectorate. A general description of the physical, political and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the Beport for the year 1911-12 (Annual Series No. 5052). The permanent population is estimated at 115,000. Trade. The total value of the trade amounted to £2,818,257 as compared with £3,110,341 in 1928-29, showing a decrease of £292,084 or 9-4 per cent. The total value of Imports amounted to £1,930,692 as against £2,116,616 in 1928-29, showing a decrease of £185,924 or 8*8 per cent. The decrease is chiefly due to the rebellion in Nejd and to the commence ment of the slump in the Pearl trade. It will be seen that Cotton goods valued at £185,734 are shown as imported from India. This is misleading as the bulk of the cargo imported from the United Kingdom arrives via India and conse quently appears under this heading, and also a large quantity of Japanese piecegoods. Pearl Industry. A general description of this Industry is given in this Agency Trade Report for the year 1927-28. Exports. The total value of Exports during the year amounted to £887,565 as against £993,725 in 1928-29 showing a decrease of £106,160 or 10\7 per cent.

Export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The Customs work is carried on by a European Director of Customs under the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. Agriculture. On its northern shores Bahrain is blessed with an abundant water supply from springs and more recently from artesian wells. An Agricultural ex pert has been engaged and it is hoped that with increasing knowledge better use will be made of the wide area of fertile soil available. As recently as j 150 years ago Bahrain was famous for its cotton which was exported as far afield as Baghdad, and there is no reason why these days should not return. So far no market for fertilisers or agricultural instru ments can be said to exist, and animal manures only are employed. Banks. A branch of the Eastern Bank exists at Bahrain and transacts all classes of business, and the hundi system is Vso used by the Hindu merchants. This bank is also the State Bank of the Bahrain Government.2 Enquiries Regarding Trade. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and mainland affairs, will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from mer chants in the United Kingdom through the Commer cial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by address ing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary matters is available in his records. Shipping. There is a regular weekly mail service from India and bi-weekly to India. As reported previously owing to the abolition of the British Post Office at Bushire the practice of sending mails to India by up-steamers via Bushire has ceased. Thus the number of mails to India are reduced from six to two. This adversely affects the commercial com munity. General Remarks.

The increase was chiefly in piecegoods, tea, coffee, tobacco, spices and build ing materials. It is interesting to note that while there was a decrease in the import of piecegoods last year, it shows an increase of £42,543 during the year under report. It will be seen that cotton goods valued at £238,140 are shown as imported from India.

S0AFL1329 Previous Papers :— 3287 2000 12.28 Colonel Barrett's report is of value as containing a very interesting account of the present position of the pearl industry, at Bahrein. It is many years since we have had any detailed information on this subject, and although we heard in 1924 of the institution of diving reforms designed to protect the divers, on the initiation of the then Political Agent, we did not receive any general survey of the pearling position in connection with them. The trade figures present no special features of interest. It may, however, be \ noted as relevant to Persian complaints of smuggling that there is a very substantial increase in the imports of sugar, both from India and from Europe, and an equally substantial/ ^substantial increase in the export of sugar to the Arab coast. The imports of tea have declined; the exports remain substantially as they were. A SEEK PQLWC&gt; so 3 £ A [;I.

C . 'J lsr\ -&gt;Report on the Trade of the Bahrein Islands for the year ending 3 I st March 1928. Introduction. A general description of the physical, political and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the report for the year 1911-12 (Annual Series No. 5052). The permanent population is estimated at 115,000. Trade. The total value of trade amounted to £3,043,222 as compared with £3,012,980 in 1926-27, showing an increase of £30,242 or 1 per cent. The total value of imports amounted to £2,029,181 as against £1,897,551 in 1926-27, showing an increase of £131,630 or 6-9 per cent. The increase was chiefly in specie, rice and kerosene oil. It is interesting to note that while there was an increase in the import of piece-goods last year, it shows a decrease of £24,043 during the year under report. Lack of market and the holding of large stocks from the previous year are responsible for the decrease. It will be observed that cotton goods valued at £198,348 are shown as imported from India. This is misleading as the bulk of the cargo imported from the United Kingdom arrives via India, consequently appears under this heading. Pearl Induitry. General .—For centuries the Persian Gulf has been famous for its pearls, and at present the centre of the industry and the chief market of the Gulf is Bahrein. During recent years important Continental, Indian and Arab merchants, who used to send their agents, have come themselves to Bahrein. Numbers employed .—Over 500 pearling craft are registered in Bahrein and about 15.000 men from Bahrein work each year as divers apart from large numbers of foreigners from Oman, Persia and the Arab Coast. Diving season .—The season is divided into three divisions. It lasts, roughly, from the middle of May until the middle of October. If the weather is calm and the sea not too cold the two short seasons are longer. The divisions are as follows :— i. Khanchech if. Ghaus iii. R add ah . about 20-25 days. the main season, 4 months and JO days, about 20-25 days. Every year the Shaikh issues a proclamation announcing the dates of the beginning and the end of the Ghaus, ordering all divers to report to their Nakhudas ten days before the opening day in order to prepare the boats for sea. No orders are issued as to Khancheeh and Raddah and Nakhudas may go out w r hen they wish. The duration of the short seasons depends on the temperature of the water. Diving methods .—The actual diving methods are simple. No mechanical apparatus is used. The pearl banks are free to everybody. When the Nakhuda has reached a likely position he anchors his boat and fixes the oars so that they extend above the water horizontally. A couple of ropes are tied to each oar, one wfith a weight upon it, on which the diver goes down, the other one by which he is pulled up, if diving in deep water. In shallow water the diver rises to the surface without assistance. The average depth is about 20 feet. When the diver comes up to the surface he hands his shells to the puller and they are heaped on the deck. The divers work in relays, diving almost continuous!v for about an hour at a time. Each dive averages about a minute and a half. Every diver provides himself with a clip, like a clothes peg, which he fastens on to his nose, also hard leather finger guards which enable him to disjodge the shells from the rocks without damaging his hands. Round his neck he carries a string bag in which he puts his shells. The divers wear nothing but a loin cloth. The shells are opened every morning before the diving begins, and thrown back into the sea. The divers have a theory that by throwing the shells into the sea they provide food for the next year’ilt oysters. The Nakhuda watches over the opening of the shells, collects any pearls and shuts them up in the sea chest. It is difficult for men to steal pearls because they wear practically no clothes and they have nowhere to hide them. Medical .—Diving is an unhealthy profession and the divers as a whole are not long-lived. The boats are very overcrowded and sometimes they remain out at sea for two months at a time. The divers live on a ration of dates, rice and fish. Most divers suffer from ear trouble. Rupture of the eardrum is almost universal, in fact men are not considered proficient until this has occurred. Euphysema of the lungs is common and is often followed by bronchitis, acute and chronic. Verv often diving causes dilation of the heart with valvular disease.2 Scurvy is often noticed during and after the season, but Nakhudas appear to know the preventive value of lime juice and no boat leaves for the banks without a quantity of dried fresh limes. Quite a number of cases of fish bites occur, especi ally by a large fish, not a shark, which inflicts a straight cut like that of a sword. During the season the Government’s hospital boat, a large well-equipped boom, which was pur chased four years ago, remains out at the banks and the Indian Sub-Assistant Surgeon deals with cases of illness among the divers. Most of the Bahrein Nakhudas seem to be particularly callous about the health of their divers. They do not understand that temporarily to release a sick diver will be more profitable in the long run. There are quite a number of blind men among the divers. Blindness does not incapacitate them from diving. Diving systems.—Divers do not receive wages. They are supposed to share in the profits of the boat’s catch. They also receive advances, loans, from their Nakhudas. Various systems are practised in Bahrein of which the most important are the following :— (i) Salafiyah, or loan system, is the most universal. In this there are two methods, Mudayanah and ’Amil. Mudayanah.—The Nakhuda of the boat is financed by the land merchant who lends money, at interest, for paying advances to the divers, equipping the boat and purchasing provisions for the season. The rate of interest has now been laid down : 20 per cent for the period of the off season and 10 per cent during the Ghaus. The same rate of interest which ii charged by the merchant to the Nakhuda is charged by the Nakhuda to the divers and added to their debit account when they receive their advances. The Nakhuda is not bound to sell his pearls to the merchant who financed him. ’Amil. —The Nakhuda borrows from a land merchant but instead of charging interest the merchant has a right to purchase the pearls at a figure which may be 20 per cent less than the market value. Throughout the whole system it is the land mer chants, the capitalists, who make the biggest profits. In reality they are partly money-lenders, but as money-lending is forbidden by the Quran some of them advance bags of rice instead of rupees, and debit the borrower with a sum considerably in excess of the market price. They are practically certain of a very good interest on the money which they lend and they also compete in the buying and selling of pearls in the market. The biggest men in the pearl industry in Bahrein are the mer chants who finance the boats. They buy pearls, cheaply, from their own Nakhudas and then sell at good profits. Only a very few of them started life as Nakhudas ; most began as land merchants in a small way, or as brokers, gradually acquiring funds with which to finance first one boat, and then another and in some cases as many as twenty or thirty boats. As these merchants do more of the big buying and selling and speculate more on th« fluctuations of the market they stand more H^sf disaster than the Nakhudas. Every merchant tries to sell his pearls locally during the season, but in most years one or two big men stick out too long for higher prices and have to follow the foreign buyers down to Bombay hoping to sell in India. (ii) Khammas system. —This is a more profitable system for the divers and is the system mostly used on the mainland. No land merchant enters into the transaction. The Nakhuda finances the boat. No advances are made and proceeds are shared after each trip to the banks. The Nakhuda. besides his ordinary share as a Nakhuda, gets half of |th of the total profits. The divers, besides their ordinary shares, get half of -jth divided among them. (iii) Azzal.—A diver goes out independently In some Nakhuda’s boat. He pays for his keep and also paying |th of his profits to the Nakhuda. Shares. —The shares of the men engaged in diving are as follows :— (i) Nakhuda . . ith of total profits aftw deducting boat licens# and all expenses. (ii) Diver . . . Three ehares. (iii) Puller . . . Two shares. (iv) Radhif (apprentice) One share. (v) Ja’adi (second-in- command) . . Three shares. The divers’ shares are paid out of the total profit after deducting Nakhuda’s share, license, cost of rations, advances made to divers. Advances. —Three advances are made by the Nakhudas to the divers during the year: i. Salaf. —At the beginning of the season. This is intended to provide for the divers’ families while men are diving and also to supply any necessaries which the divers may take out with them. ii. Kkarjiyah. —A small amount paid about th» middle of the season. iii. Tisqam. —An advance made about six weeks after the end of the season intended to maintain the diver during the off season. Under the present regime the amount of these advances is laid down by proclamation.3 The following are the amounts of the advances since the reforms. Previously good divers-were some times lent as much as Rs. 700 for one advance Yefcr. — Salaf. Kharjiyah. Tlsqam. Us. Divers 190 I Pullers 145 1 ^rot laid 1343 Divers 100 1 down.

The object was to give the divers fairer conditions and to help them to reduce their debts. The reforms effected several improve ments, regular accounts, a fixed rate of interest, definite advances, and the abolition of the old Salfah Court, a notoriously corrupt diving court. The market .—Most of the important buying and selling is done on shore. The biggest buyers are the Continental merchants, Messrs. Rosenthal and Pack, Mohamedali Zainal and his partner Bienen- field, and one or two Indian and Persian merchants. They usually arrive just after the opening of the main season and leave a week or two after it closes. The pearls are polished and graded in Bombay and then taken to Paris and London for sale to English and American buyers. If more big buyers came from Europe local prices would be higher and Bahrein would profit. Possibly easier communi cation between Europe and the East, especially by air, and improved living conditions in Bahrein will induce more buyers to come here in the future. None of the buyers pay cash down. Sometimes payments are not completed until the following season, but usually half is paid on purchase and the remainder carried over for three or four months. Brokers .—Much of the actual buying and selling is done by brokers who carry pearls from merchant to merchant offering them for sale. Brokers get com mission from the buyer, or occasionally, by special arrangement, from both parties. When the pros pective buyer has made a definite offer three notes are written describing the weight of the pearls and amount offered. The bidder keeps one note, the broker takes another and the third is placed with the pearls which are sealed up by the broker and left with the buyer until the owner decides whether he will sell or not. It is remarkable that though there is ample opportunity for theft and cheating by brokers very few cases of this sort actually occur. Often men who are literally bankrupt carry round pearls that are worth lacs of rupees. Pearl brokers are not licensed and do not have to deposit a security as is the rule with bazar brokers. Tawashah .—While the pearling fleet is at the banks, brokers and agents of the big shore merchants visit the fleet, in the boats which take out provisions to the divers and for the purpose of buying pearls. According to custom when a Tawashah buyer has boarded a boat none other can interrupt his bargaining with the Nakhuda. Other prospective buyers have to lie off till the deal is finished. Motor launches .—During recent years the number of motor launches in Bahrein has much increased. They consist of locally built boats with motor engines. Cultured 'pearls .—The increasing number of cul tured pearls which find their way into the pearl market is said to be having a bad effect on pearl trade in general. These pearls, which are worth about ^rd the value of a real pearl, cannot be dis tinguished, even by an expert, without an elaborate i electrically worked apparatus. Last season several cultured pearls were detected in Bahrein. Mr. Bienenfield, the partner of Mohamedali Zainal, brought out with him the apparatus for testing pearls. In cases of bored pearls it is considered infallible, but in the case of unbored pearls it leaves a slight margin of doubt. A needle, containing in itself two minute mirrors, is introduced into the pearl itself and by means of powerful electric light the inside of the pearl is so illuminated that one can see whether the heart of the pearl is natural or not. The Bahrein Government has forbidden the / import of cultured as well as artificial pearls, but in the former case it is impossible for the Customs officers to detect them. It was suggested that the Government should purchase one of the testing machines and charge a fee to the users. .*■ = The pearl catch. —It is impossible to state the average value of the season’s catch ; as there is no export duty in Bahrein no figures exist showing the value of the pearls which are taken down to India. All Nakhudas do not have their accounts made up by the official diving clerks, so a reference to them is insufficient. Last year it was said that the pearls in Bahrein at the end of the season were worth about two million pounds. Mohamedali Zainal, who bought mostly in Bahrein, took £600,000 worth of pearls to London at the end of the 1927 season. As rough estimate it can be said that a year’s catch is worth between one and three million pounds.Exports. The total value of exports for the year amounted to £1,014,041 as against £1,115,429 in 1926-27, showing a decrease of £101,388 or 9-1 per cent. The pearl trade dominated the commercial situa tion.

The tariff is fixed by treaty at 5 per cent ad valorem on all imports. In June 1920 on the advice of the Government of India the tax on goods landed at Bahrein in transit for the mainland was reduced to 2 per cent from 5 per cent at which it formerly stood. Export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The Customs work is carried on by a European Director of Customs under the orders of the Ruler of Bahrein. Enquiries regarding Trade. The Political Agent, Bahrein, who is in touch with the local and mainland affairs, wh. oe glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United Kingdom through the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary matters is available in his record. Shipping. There is a regular weekly mail service from India and bi-weekly to India. As reported previously, owing to the abolition of the British Post Office at Bushire, the practice of sending mails to India by up-steamers via Bushire has ceased. Thus the number of mails to India reduced from 6 to 2. This somewhat adversely affects the commercial com munity. General Remarks. Motor roads suitable for light cars exist nearly all over the Islands. There are about 20§ motor cars of various makes and motor cars are available on hire. Motor boats ply regularly between Bahrein and Qatar on the mainland ;/nd also run between Bahrein and Qatif. (Sd.) C. C. J.
