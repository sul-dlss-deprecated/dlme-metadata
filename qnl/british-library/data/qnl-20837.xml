The total revenue was 48 lakhs, nearly five lakhs more than in the previous year and six lakhs more than I had anticipated in the Budget. I was able to add 19 lakhs to the Reserve Fund which now amounts to 40 lakhs and at the same time to spend lakhs on social services, education, public health and municipalities, 3 lakhs on public protection and 4^ lakhs on Public Works in addition to paying for the general administration of the State and providing 16 lakhs for the Civil List and allowances to the Ruling Family. The financial prospect for the new year is not however as promising as it was for 1367. The pearl industry is again suffering from severe depression and the development of Ras Tanura, as the port for the eastern side of Saudi Arabia, will put an end to most of Bahrain's transit trade and will also affect the direct imports into Bahrain. The development of this port was inevitable but fortunately, for Bahrain, the port was not opened before the California Arabian Oil Company had imported a large quantity of equipment etc., for their operation on the mainland which came through Bahrain and on which customs was paid. I have anticipated a reduction of 4 lakhs in customs revenue but possibly the position may not be as bad as I anticipate. The chief expenditure items in the Budget for 1358 which is the 18th Budget that I have had the honour of submitting, are a proposed investment of 11 lakhs, from revenue, and 3 lakhs from balance, to be added to the Reserve Fund; provision of 3 lakhs for the cost of the Manama Muharraq bridge and a heavy programme of public works including the hospital building. On the revenue side the oil royalty has been assessed at the same amount as in the 1357 Budget. Included in miscellaneous receipts are 4 lakhs which are expected to be received on account of certain special oil payments other than royalty. Events of importance during the year included His Highness's illness in the summer and his subsequent visit to Kashmir for recuperation and the visit of H.R.H. Princess Alice and the Earl of Athlone to Bahrain on their way back from Saudi Arabia. Relations with neighbouring States, excepting Qattar, continued to be friendly. Trade and intercourse with Qattar have not been resumed. Negotiations regarding an oil concession over the additional area of Bahrain with the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited took place during the early summer and in the autumn and winter but at end of the year no definite arrangement had been arrived at. A certain amount of political unrest was prevalent during the year which terminated in a demonstration during Ramadan, this is dealt with elsewhere in the report. C.

Details are given in Customs Department report. Royalty on Oil Rs. 35,44,000/- The royalty was approximately 4 lakhs more than last year's royalty and lakhs more than the sum which I anticipated in the Budget. Royalty was paid on 1,012,570 tons of oil. Passport Fees Rs. 19,000/- There was a decrease of approximately Rs. 1,000 in passport fees. Judicial Receipts Rs. 7 700/- There was a decrease of approximately Rs. 3000 in Judicial receipts owing to no important civil cases being heard in the courts. Car Taxes and Driving Licenses Rs. 12,400/- The total amount collected was Rs 21,000 but from this sum one half of the car taxes was paid to the Manama and Muharraq municipalities towards the cost of upkeep of town roads. Land Revenue Rs. 25,300/- This includes land registration fees and rent of Government lands. Interest on Reserve Rs. 1,00,820/- At the end of 1356 the Reserve Fund was 18 lakhs. During 1357 it was increased to Rs. 39,96,000. The Reserve Fund is invested in British Government securities which pay interest at 3J/o. Oil Inspection Fees Rs; 9,437/- In the Budget for 1357 an error was made in assessing the amount due under this heading. The estimates were based, incorrectly, on the total output of oil. They should have been based on the quantity of oil shipped on other than the Company's ships, which is gauged on behalf of the Company by the Bahrain Government representative. Miscellaneous Receipts Ps. 5,000/- This includes sale of Government Forms, divers books, sale of unserviceable stores and licenses for drilling wells etc. etc. The total revenue was 4| lakhs more than the revenue during 1357. Notes on Expenditure during 1357. The estimated expenditure for 1357, excluding the contribution to the Reserve Fund, was Rs. 30,02,000. The actual expenditure was Rs. 31,08,000. In the Budget the one third of the oil royalty was estimated at Rs. 10,00,000 but the actual amount was Rs. 11,81,000.DISPENSARY AND MEDICAL OFFICERS FLAT. South Aspect. South Aspect. North Aspect, from Sea.Total expenditure other than contribution to the Reserve Fund and payment of the third of the oil royalty to His Highness was approximately seventy five thousand less than the estimated expenditure. The expenditure according to the Budget headings of 1357 was as follows - 1. Allowances to Ruling Family. Budget estimate Rs. 14,70,000 Actual expenditure „ 16,27,253 The one third of the oil royalty amounted to Rs. 11,81,461 which was paid to His Highness's Privy Purse. The Civil List and the payment from oil royalty absorbed one third of the whole revenue of the State for the year. His Highness granted a bonus from the oil money at the two half yearly payments to all persons enjoying salaries from the Civil List amounting to five months pay in twelve months and also special payments to the three senior shaikhs of the Ruling Family, Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa, Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad. These payments amounted altogether to about Rs. 1,91,000. 2. Administrative Services.

The cost of furniture and equipment for the new hospital and dispensary was Rs 56,000. The remaining expenditure included rent of the quarantine and contingencies • 4. Public Protection. Budget estimate Rs. 2,00,000 Actual expenditure „ 2,92,340 The expenditure exceeded the estimated sum by almost one third because it was decided early in the year that the strength of the State Police should be increased and more arms and ammunition should be purchased.Five hundred new rifles and half a million rounds of ammunition were boucht and the State Police Force was increased by over fifty men. 5.

Two rooms under the bungalow were reconstructed, for use as a store, and one new room was built above them. Various major repairs and alterations were carried out. fl. Completion of Muharraq Girls School. Budget estimate Rs. 5,000 Actual expenditure „ 20,492 The additional expenditure under this heading was necessitated by the need for a high wall surrounding the school playground and also the alterations in the adjacent house which was bought by the Government and is used as a house for the teaching staff. O. Completion of Hawar Fort. Budget estimate Rs. 3,000 Actual expenditure „ 11,0(59 Included in this expenditure is the cost of erecting about twenty stone beacons on various islands in the Bahrain waters. A barbed wire fence was built round the Fort and electric lighting was installed. p. Completion of Law Courts. Budget estimate Rs. 6,000 Actual expenditure „ H,848 The drainage system was found to be inadequate and new sewage pipes had to be installed, this accounted for the additional expenditure above the budgeted amount which was outstanding from the previous year. q.

The improvement in the pearl industry which was mentioned in annual report for 1356 was not maintained during 1857 Ihe last season was a bad one from all points of view. Fewer boats went out diving and value of the catch decreased. Most of the boats failed to make any profit. The market in Bahrain was dull at the beginning of the season but towards G-huffal there was some activity. Most of the catch was bought in Bahrain jy Messrs. Gendmal Brothers, a well known firm of Indian pearl dealers. 1 he only other foreign buyer of importance who visited Bahrain was Mr. S. Pack. The total number of Bahrain boats licensed for diving during the season was 252 which is 19 less than during the previous year. Ten years ago the Bahrain pearling fleet numbered over 500 boats. The total amount received by the divers according to actual figures available and a proportional calculation of boats whose accounts are not recorded, was approximately Rs. 7,56,000. Last year this fiigurc was approximately Rs. 13,00,000. Only one important pearl was found, it weighed 38 chows and was sold for Rs 13 000. The shares of the men in this boat waw Rs. 225 for a diver and Rs. 150 for a puller, there were 82 men in the boat. The quantity of pearls was considerably less than last year but the quality of the *' Sherin ' grade was better. The following is a rough comparison of prices :— grade 1356 1357 Naim Rs. 20-8-0 Rs. 15-0-0 Golwa „ 16-0-0 „ 10-0-0 Sherin „ 60-0-0 „ 28-0-0 The largest catch of any one boat, excluding the one in which the large pearl was found, was as follows :— Grade Naim 175 mithgals Golwa 173 chows „ Sherin 53 „ The average earnings of divers and pullers in the six most successful boats was as follows :— Diver Rs. 117-0-0 Puller Rs. 78-0-0 As this represents the earning of a man who is diving for nearly four and a half months it is evident that ordinary work on shore is more remunerative in these days than diving. The average 'Gataan', or share, of a diver and puller was, for a diver Rs. 60 and for a puller Rs. 40. The advances during the year were as follows Diver Puller Tesqam Rs. 40-0-0 Rs. 30-0-0 Salaf 40-0-0 30-0-0 Kharjieh 10-0-0 10-0-0 Rs. 90-0-0 Rs. 70-0-0 Interest 5» 12-0-0 &gt;? 9-0-0 Rs. 102-0-0 Rs. 79-0-0 jws. J.* ia-W • v .j. v. The average diver, who took the regular advances, instead of making any profit, increased his debt by lis. 39.In spite of the disasterous result of the season for the divers and nakhndas money was made by brokers and pearl dealers. Advances. At the annual meeting held by the Government to decide the amount of the diving advances the leading men of the industry announced that unless the amount of the advances was considerably reduced they would be compelled to release their divers on ' barwas Divers on ' barwa ' receive no advance from their own nakhudas and are free to dive with any nakhuda, who will employ them, on condition that they pay i of their earnings to their original nakhuda. It was decided that the advances should be as follows:— Diver Puller Tesqam Rs. 20 0 0 Rs. 15 0 0 Salaf 20 0 0 15 0 0 Kharjieh &gt;&gt; 10 0 0 10 0 0 Bs. 50 0 0 Rs. 40 0 0 In 1856 the advances totalled Rs. 90/- diver and Rs. 70/- puller. In spite of the drastic reduction a number of nakhudas have not been able to make advances to their divers. There was no protest or complaint from the divers when the proclamation about advances was issued. Pearl Propaganda. During 1938 a number of leading pearl dealers, most of whom were American, formed an association in New York registered under the name of Pearl Associates The object of this body was to stimulate public interest in real pearls and to combat the cultured pearl propaganda. Real pearls, in the past, have not required advertisement, but the sellers of cultured pearls advertise their goods all over the world. The Mellon Institute of Industrial research agreed to conduct a scientific investigation of the cultured pearl and to issue an authentic opinion, which would carry weight and which is expected to counteract the unfounded claims put forward in favour of cultured pearls, i he real pearl is to be advertised by means of press publicity and modern methods. During the summer of 1938 Mr, Charles Murrav, of the firm of Cromur, a member of the Association and a well known pearl dealer visited Bahrain and met many of the local pearl merchants to whom he explained the object of the association. The Bahrain Government decided to contribute to the association and a public meeting was held in November which was attended by leading local and foreign'representatives of the pearl industry at which the whole matter was discussed. It was announced that the Government would contribute Rs. 17,000 to the associa tion and a subscription list was opened for contributions from local pearl dealers. Approximately Rs. 3.000 was received. Pearl Associates are employing Mr. Edward Bernays, a well known American ' publicist M to organise a publicity campaign for real pearls. It is hoped that during the course of the investigations the Mellon Institute may develop a practicable apparatus for testing undrilled pearls. The only machine which now exists for testing them is too cumbersome and costly for ordinary use. Future Prospects. The immediate outlook of the Bahrain pearl industry does not appear to be bright and conditions generally do not seem favourable to an improvement in the trade. It is frequently suggested that if diving could cease for one season the market would improve but such a step could only be taken with the co-operation of all the diving States in the Gulf and it is unlikely that they would combine.14 84 Police and Public Security. 1. Police Administration (a) Strength of Police on 30th Dulhaj 1357 corresponding to 19th February 103!) was as follows :— Havildars 4 Naiks 7 Lance Naiks 17 Policemen 240 Band 17 Camel Section 15 Horse Section 16 Indian Instructors 5 Camp Followers ... 22 Camels 19 Horses 19 Number of men discharged ... 13 Number of men died 4 Naturs Manamah 64 Muharraq 54 Elsewhere 8 The strength was increased by 94 men during the year and it is intended thai the force shall eventually be raised to 350 N.C.Os and men. When this figure has been reached there will be approximately 200 men at the Fort available for training and for use in case of emergency after deducting men on leave, outpost duty and sick. Provision for the increase has been made in the 1358 Budget. (h) Recruitment. There has been no difficulty in enlisting suitable recruits. The type of men applying to enlist has changed somewhat during the last year or two. Lately several young men who have spent a year or two at the Government schools have been taken on as'recruits and the average age of new men is younger than it used to be. It is found that recruits who are young when they enlist are keener and more adaptable to training and eventually become more efficient than older men. An unusually large number of Bahama applied during the year to join the Police but their physique and eyesight are not on the whole as good as that of the Arabs and men of African origin. (c) Routine and Recreation. The usual musketry courses were tired during the year and several sections of recruits completed their training. The usual morning and afternoon parades on six days a week were held at the Fort and the following guards and outposts were maintained :— Hawar Islands Garrison 20 Hedd Police Station 7 Muharraq Police Station 8 Manamah Police Station 11 Agency Guard 4 His Highness's Guard 5 Refinery V Awali 12 Bazaar Picket 10]6 The Police took part in a Defence Scheme which was practised during the September crisis, they provided guards over the Bapco premises and at various stra tegical points. A number of ex policemen and extra guards w r ere enlisted for special duty at this time. There were two route marches during the year in the spring and autumn A number of Guards of Hon ur were provided and the usual ceremonial parade was held at the Palace on the occasion of His Highness's accession celebrations. A Guard of Honour was mounted at the Palace for H.R.H. Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone. (d) Discipline. One man was dismissed, two N.C.Os were reduced to the ranks and 13 men were punished for various offences during the year. The conduct of the Police has been good and their behaviour at the time of incidents and disturbances in Ramadan, when they were required to take action against a crowd of local youths many of whom were connected with individual policeman, was satisfactory. (e) Health of the Police. (a) During the year 1357, a total number of 3,057 police were seen at sick parade, giving an average of approximately 10 per parade out of a force of 316. The average number of in-patients at the police dispensary at any one time was 5. During the year there were 4 deaths among the police. One was the result of a motor accident: two deaths occured in hospital from tuberculosis and pneumonia respectively and the fourth death occured suddenly (probably from malaria). The chief single cause of sickness was malaria, which was responsible directly for 34% of all attendances at sick parade and probably, indirectly, for a considerable proportion of other cases. The reason for this high incidence of malaria, despite bi-weekly distribution of prophylactic doses of quinine and weekly spraying of barrack rooms, is that the Fort is situated in one of the most malarious districts of Manama. The second commonest complaint was ulceration of the legs, which was responsible for 28% attendances at sick parade. These ulcers, though rarely dan gerous, cause a great deal of disability and absence from duty. The majority of these cases are due to ill fitting footwear, dirt and neglect: such ulcers are not infrequently seen in men returning from outpost duty, having been present for a considerable time and necessitating several weeks absence, before the man is fit to resume his duty. Constitutional diseases, such as malaria and syphilis probably frequently assist in the production of these ulcers and in the prevention of their healing. Regular foot-inspection, early treatment and general improvement in health (e.g. eradication of malaria) should do much to reduce this cause of disability. During the past year, three cases of pulmonary tuberculosis have occured among the police. One |of these cases proved fatal and the other two have been incapacitated from further duty. This high proportion of cases in a group of selected men, merely refiects the general incidence of the disease in the island. Venereal diseases contribute a small percentage of the cases seen at sick parade, but they are probably a great deal more frequent than is immediately apparent, and they will receive further investigation in the future. Respiratory affections, dysentery, affections of the eye, toothache and minor injuries contribute the majority of the other conditions for which the police seek treatment. (b) Prisoners Health. The health of the State prisoners is generally speak ing, poor: due no doubt to the fact that they are most drawn from the lower strataIfi of society. As with the police, malaria and ulceration of the extremities arc common, but the prisoners tend to exhibit a wider range of pathological conditions and frequently several different conditions at once. The health of the prisoners appears generally to improve as a result of their stay in prison. (c) Infant Welfare Clinic. The weekly clinic for Policemen's children which began in 1357 was continued throughout the year, it is held in the married lines by Mrs. Belgrave and one of the Government nurses. The attendance has increased and almost three hundred cases were dealt with during the \ear. (f ) Cavalry Section. The cavalrv section was trained during the year. It has been nfe ed for patrols in the vicinity of the town and as a mounted escort. During the disturbance nothing was more effective in clearing the bazaar than the cavalry section the crowd dispersed on the sight of it. The horses have been trained to stand rifle fire Towards the end of the year the mounted police began to learn to play polo Mos. of the horses were provided by His Highness but a few young animals were purchased locally. (g) Buildings and Gardens. Details of buildings are given in the Public Works Department re PO[t- Twelve houses for married N.C .Os. were built behind the Fort. A section of the main wall on the south east was rebuilt and a small tower was constructed at the south east corner. The wall from the bungalow to the North east tower was rebuilt and some repairs were carried out in the east wing of the bungalow. A v, ide ledge is being constructed all around the inside of the Fort wall so that when the ok walls are finally rebuilt it will be possible for sentries to patrol the battlements. A set of latrines was installed inside the fort, and in the married lines and an incinerator has been built behind the Fort. Previously there was no proper sanita tion system. The camel lines were surrounded by a low stone wall. The Fort garden was thoroughly cleared, drains were filled in and new water channels built and what used to be waste ground is now under cultivation. Event ually it should be possible to grow enough lucerne in the Fort garden to feed the horses and camels. (h) Fire Section. The fire section was called oat several times during the year and was effect ive in putting out fires. ( i ) Promotions. Naik Abdul Karim son of Haji Sulman was promoted to Havildar. 5 L/Naiks were promoted to Naiks 10 Policemen were promoted to L/Naiks. The force suffers from a lack of N.C.Os with any degree of eiucation, the older and more senior men are mostly illiterate, the younger men, who have been to school have not long enough service or sufficient experience to justify their .promo tion. (j ) Pay and Allowances. The period of service, previously four years, before which good conduct pay could not be drawn, was reduced to two years. Leave which was previously three months after every two years, was reduced to two months after two years. 2. Traffic Control. There has been a remarkable decrease in the number of motor accidents. During 1356 six persons lost their lives owing to motor accidents and 56 accidents(g) 17 were investigated by the Police. During the year under review there were two fatal accidents and 20 accidents were investigated. The reductions in accidents may be ascribed to the following reasons :— 1. Annual medical examination of drivers of public vehicles. 2. Stricter surveillance of cars by police and traffic patrols on the main roads. 3. The imposition of 'baffles' on cars plying for hire regulating their speed. 4. The one way traffic system in Manama. In the past most of the accidents were in the Municipal areas. 5. Speed limits on certain roads. The number of motor vehicles registered during the year was 475, the num ber of licensed drivers is 753 and 78 new drivers were tested in 1857. 3. Crime. (a) There have been very few serious crimes during the year. The most important cases dealt with by the police were the charges against people who took part in the agitation and disturbances daring Ramidan. Persons were convicted in this connection in the Bahrain and Agency courts. A murder took place in Hedd, a (jirl was drowned by her father, for the usual reason, but the father escaped arrest and took refuge in Qattar. The reputation of Hedd, as being a place where women are frequently murdered, is notorious. Altogether 591 persons were charged with criminal offences during the year of whom 302 were foreigners and 289 were Bahrain subjects. The cases are sum marised as follows :— Cases of violence 393 theft 101 miscellaneous 21 Persons convicted 502 discharged 89 The number of criminal cases, in a State whose population is thought to be about 150,000, is unusually small. (b) Liquor. There is a steady increase in drunkenness. The sale of eau de cologne was forbidden as it was being used as liquor but in spite of regulations and precautions whiskey, arak, and methylated spirit are obtainable in Bahrain by people who know where to go to get them. The high price which is willingly paid for whiskey is a strong incentive to persons holding liquor permits to sell a bottle or two. It is difficult for the Police to deal with this matter as drinking is carried on inside private houses by people who are in positon to ensure against being overlooked or interrupted. 4. General. During the absence of the Adviser on summer leave Mr. W. B. Steele, State Engineer, was in command of the Police. A police launch equipped with a 75 H.P. 'Kelvin' Recardo Engine was built during the year. The launch is used for coastal patrol work and for plying between Bahrain and Hawar. A barbed wire fence was built around the Fort at Hawar and several of the water cisterns were repaired. Shaikh Khalifah bin Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa completed a course of training at the Police Training College at Nasik preparatory to serving in the State Police.18 Public Health hy Dr. I. Davenport Jones State Medical Officer. THE VILLAGE DISPENSARIES. During the past year, the work of the village dispensaries has continued, and a small clinic was established at the Nairn dispensary (formerly used as a women's dispensary) to serve until the new hospital is completed : although primarily intended for the police, the public were admitted as in-patients and out-patients: General Dispensary Number of Out-Patients Number of In-Patients Number of Minor Operations 7,411 103 72 7,109 — 397 11,216 — 40 6,156 — 34 O.P.S. I.P.S. Visits Deliveries 4,836 7,616 34 350 13 38 56 79 Naim for last half year only Muharraq Suk-Al-Khamis Hedd Women's Dispensary Manama Muharraq In addition to the work at this clinic, the doctor at Suk-Al-Khamis has visited weekly the village of Budaya, Karzakan, Sitra and Ttafaa. The figures show a considerable increase, over those of last year and indicate that the public are learning to appreciate the value of this service. The standard of work in the dispensaries varies a good deal, but they fill a very definite need in the island. The dispensaries are however, poorly housed and ill-equipped, and it is hoped that it will be possible to remedy this deficiency during the next year, especially as the value of these clinics will be enhanced with the opening of the hospital, which will enable the officers in charge to send patients in for investigation and treatment, not at present, available. Public Health 1. As no census is taken and there is no system of registration of births and deaths in Bahrain, it is impossible to give any detailed statistical information about the health of the people. None the less, certain general remarks may be made about the more important diseases, occuring in the island, judging from an examination of a considerable number of patients, and from the attendances at the government dispensaries. Malaria. This disease, the most important to be considered,is present throughout the island. Attendances at the clinics indicate that approx: 20% of patients are diagnosed as suffering from Malaria. The amount varies considerably according to the district. Details of the investigation carried out by Major Afridi I.M.S. and his staff recently are discussed under separate heading. Diseases of the Eye. These conditions constitute 15% of cases attending for treatment at the dispensaries. The vast majority of these cases are trachomatous in origin and are frequently in very advanced state before the patient appears for treatment. Cataract and other diseases of the eye are quite common, but their treatment is frequently complicated by co-existing trachoma. Very severe forms of ophthalmia are frequently seen among the children, many of whom are blinded for life as a result; such cases are nearly always preventable and are due to lack of proper attention at birth, dirt, neglect and ignorance.19 Small-pox is responsible for a considerable number of the cases of blindness among children. Even among the healthy, the standard of sight is low, as demonstrated by number of rejections of applicants for driving-licenses, and of recruits for the police, after eye-tests. In general it may be said that the great majority of cases of disease of the eye are preventable or could be arrested by treatment. Dirt, neglect, under-nourishment and ignorance are the precursors of these tragic cases, and only with improvement in general living condition and with education can improvement come. Diseases of the skin. All sorts of skin disease particularly ulceration of the legs, are extremely common (18% of dispensary pts:). These conditions obtain particularly among the poor classes and among labourers ; their cause is dirt, neglect and undernourishrnent. Constitutional disease, such as malaria and syphilis are often contributory factors in their causation. Ulcers of the leg are slow to heal and responsible for much disability. Dysentery, f 5 % ) All forms are endemic throughout the island. Dysentery is a fairly common cause of death among the old, and is probably responsible for a very high mortality among the new-born : the exact extend of the latter it is difficult to estimate, at present, Lack of sanitation, inadequate disposal of refuse, profuse breeding of flies, and the primitive habits of the people are responsible for the endimicity of this disease. Enteric. A number of cases of this disease have been reported during the year in Manama and Muharraq. This disease appears to be on the increase in Bahrain recently, according to local medical opinion; remarks concerning the causa tion of dysentery are applicable to typhoid ; the present conditions in the towns are very favourable for the occurance of an epidemic. Vensreal disease. All forms of venereal disease are seen. Unfortunately patients are inclined to present themselves only for treatment during the more acute stages of their complaints and fail to attend regularly so as to effect a proper cure : the disease lies latent in the sufferer giving rise to remote symptoms, and is transmitted to others. The problem of the actual amount of disease present in Bahrain, will receive more detailed investigation when facilities for laboratory examinations are available. . Tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is comparatively common in Bahrain : nearly all the cases seen are of a severe type and are often fatal. Pulmonary tuberculosis is common among adults (3 cases occured among the police, during the last year) and tuberculosis of glands and bone is seen among the children the latter probably bovine in origin and conveyed by infected milk. The problem presented by this serious disease is not an easy one climate, racial susceptibility, introduced infection and immunity lowered by malnutrition and co-existing disease are all aetiological factors to be considered ; pearl-diving is said to predispose to tuberculosis. From a practical point of view, better conditions of life and nutrition, with reduction in the incidence of such constitutional disease as malaria and syphilis are the measures most likely to have a beneficial effect on this disease : the construction of a special institution for the treatment and isolation of tuberculous patients should receive consideration in the future. Diseases of the Respiration (excluding pulmonary tuberculosis) : 5%. Pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma are included under this category; the latter condition being particularly common among the Persian section of the community. The high humidity, and the extremes of temperature occurring, are probably respon sible for the frequency of these diseases. Pneumonia is not infrequently fatal. Small -pox. This disease is endemic in the island. Cases rarely present themselves at the dispensaries for treatment during the active stage, but the30 seauele are all too apparent throughout the island;— in the schools approx ; 17^ of sequeide are an uuu o r-i T u nr onortion of cases of blindness boys showed scarring from small-pox). A {airl&gt; bign proporu result from this cause. Vaccination against small-pox is available at the clinics hut it is rarely requested^ except by the more intelligent or as the result of the passport regulations OI OLiier uuuuti ico. Comnulsorv vaccination would eradicate this disease almost entirely, but would presumably arouse the opposition which seems invariably to accompany the introduction of this reform into any country. Gvnsecological &amp; obstetrical conditions. Women make use of all tI k government dispensaries fairly freely (about one patient m ^ rarelv renuest treatment for disorders peculiar to their sex, except at the two especial clinics which are under the care of nurses : the treatment available at these clinics is of necessity very limited, although the number of labour-cases attended (135) is considerable advance on that of last Near (40). The introduction of a lady-doctor and the construction of a special hospital for women, should, therefore be of the greatest value in this wide held. 2. THE MALARIA REPORT. At the beginning of last year. Major Afridi I M .S. an expert of the Malaria Institute India, instituted a very thorough examination into the problem of malaria in Bahrain. The results of his investigation are embodied m a detailed and extremely valuable report which includes suggestions for a practical scheme of malaria-control. In brief, the report assesses the amount of malaria which is present lhrou'hout the island, and indicates clearly the high incidence of the disease m Manama, particularly in the area known as Naim, and the area adjacent to the ort. The relative freedom of Muharraq island is shown. The species stephensi of the anopheline mosquito is incriminated as the chief and probably only, carrier -species of mosquito on the island. I his mosquito, w ic conveys tertian quartan and intermittent fevers breeds in the shallow domestic wells which are present in nearly all the native dwelling places m Manama and other town; in the irrigation channels of the gardens, and m the edges of the swamps of water'which occur particularly in the neighbourhood of Manama. Measures of control include the fllling-in of the domestic wells (with provision of an alternative water-supply) re -organisation of the irrigation systems in the gardens and eradication of the swamps. Temporary measures of contro are by the use of larvicidal chemicals and by encouraging the spread of the local fresh-w ater, fish, aphanius dispar which is actively larvicidal. It is sue'ested that anti-malaria measures should be commenced in Manama, which is most in need of attention, and be spread gradually to the rest of the island.21 3. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF SCHOOL — CHILDREN. It is hoped in the coming year to institute a regular system of medical exami nation for all the government schools. Owing to irregular attendances, and lack of records, these examinations must essentially be of a very elementary nature, but they afford an useful source of information for statistical purposes, with regard to the district in which the school is situated, and form the basis of suggestions for improvement in the health of the children. Children requiring treatment for any condition, are sent to the nearest government clinic. A preliminary examinations of the boy's schools has been carried out and has provided the following information ;— Place Manama Muharraq Hedd Rafa-a- sharqi Suq-al- Khamis Sitra Number of scholars examined Enlarged spleens (Malaria) % ...

QUARANTINE SERVICE This is under the control of the Q.M.O. No cases of plague or of cholera have been reported during the year. 5 COMMENTS. Although it is immediately apparent that there is a great deal of sickness in Bahrain, the vast majority of it is avoidable, and it is to be hoped that more measures for the eradication of preventable diseases and for the improvement of health generally, will eventually be introduced : Slowly, of necessity, because of the need of understanding and co-operatiou among the people whose main characteristic is apathy, the expense involved and the magnitude of the change necessitated. A system of malaria control, as described in the recent report, and of general vaccination are examples of essential reforms. Adequate sanitation, at present notable by its absence, is another, but one presenting very many difficulties. The people themselves are ignorant and generally backward, but in no way is their simplicity more apparent than in their attitude towards medicine and health generally. They are commonly insanitary in their persons and habits, and very apathetic towards illness. More often than not, they present themselves for treatment in the final stage of disease, when nothing can be of avail, they demand fantastic and useless remedies, always expect a dramatic cure and are intolerant of any tedious or22 prolonged course of treatment. To counter this, there is onl} their in\ariabl\ cheerful and optimistic disposition combined with a capacity for suffering mnc i without complaint. Education is very essential to assist the people towards better health. Land Registration Department. Registration of Sales, Gifts and Titles The total number of registrations carried out during the year was 710 including 470 sales, 65 gifts and 175 titW ol which five were Wakf. Kegistration fees amounted to Rs 7,671 and other fees amounted to Rs 807, total revenue being Rs. 8,478. Land registration fees in Bahrain are low in comparison to similar fees in neighbouring countries. The present scale is as follows: 1. on property valued at Rs. 500 and under Rs. 5 2. ., „ „ „ 500 to 10,000 Re. 1 % 3 „ „ 10,000 to 20,000 First 10,000 @ 1 % and then Rs. 4 per Rs. 500. 4 i ^ v „ above Rs. 20, 000 Rs. 3 per Rs. 500. Revenue from Sales etc. Rents from Government land amounted to Rs. 3 710 and Rs. 2,724 was received from sales of small plots of ground usually adjacent to property owned by the purchasers. Government forms worth Rs 1, 609 were sold during the year. This work has now been taken over by the Accounts Department. The forms are used for all official transactions for receipts, agreements etc, etc. A sum of Rs. 950 was collected from renewals of fish trap licenses. Property owned by Iranians. Khan Sahib Mohamed Khalil, Superintendent of the Land Department was appointed assessor on behalf of the Bahrain Govern ment in connection with the law regarding property owned by Iranians. About twenty five properties were valued, the owners valuation amounted to Rs 102 875. the Government valuation was Rs 62,897 and the final valuation in the court of the Political Agent was Rs 63,000. Land Survey, a. The town of Manama has been re-surveyed to the scale of 100 feet to one inch. h. A major portion of Gozaibia has been surveyed to the scale of 200 feet to an inch. The:remainder will be surveyed during 1358. c. Rafa al Sharki was surveyed to the scale of 100 feet to an inch. d. Rafa al Gharbi has been surveyed to the scale of 100 feet to an inch. e. The land between Rafa al Sharki and Rafa al Gharbi was surveyed to the scale of 500 feet to an inch. f More than half of the village of Dar Kulaib has been surveyed. q. The tract of open land, now being put under cultivation, to the west of Dar Kulaib up to the sea has been surveyed. h. Part of Island of Sitra has been surveyed. i. Portions of the villages of Dair and Busaiteen in the Island of Muharraq were surveyed for the R.A.F. j The main Island of Hawar Group was surveyed and a map of the island has been made.23 Judicial. Bahrain Courts. Number of new civil cases heard in the Bahrain Court ... ... 237 Number of new civil cases heard in Small Court ... 475 In addition to these about 200 criminal cases were dealt with by the two courts, most of the cases being petty offences. Court fees and fine collected Rs. 7,700. No cases of outstanding importance were heard and there were no biff civil cases. 0 i ^^ e ^^khAbdull a bin Hamad was in England his place on the court was taken by Shaikh Ah bin Ahmed, the Amir of Raiaa, who was subsequently appointed a permanent magistrate on Bahrain Court. ^ rr . magistrates on the various courts at the end of the year were the following:— Bahrain Court; Shaikh Rashid bin Mohamed Shaikh Abdulla bin Hamad Shaikh Ali bin Ahmed Small Court; Shaikh Ali bin Khalifah bin Daij Shaikh Daij bin Hamad Shaikh Mohamed bin Ali Junior Joint Court; Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad President Majlis Tijara; Shaikh Mohamed bin Abdulla Appeal Court; Shaikh Abdulla bin Tsa Shaikh Salman bin Hamad The Adviser The number of appeals from the Small Court to the Bahrain Court was seven and eight appeals were heard by the appeal court. During the political unrest towards the end of the year there was much criticism of the Bahrain Courts. It was eventually decided that expert advice should be obtained on compiling a code of laws for use in the courts. Much work has already been done in coding existing rules, regulations and local customs such as the diving laws, fish trap rules etc. etc. but no attempt has been made to draw up a penal code. Expert knowledge and advice is necessary before this work can be completed. Owing to the absence of any regular code judgments given in similar cases by the same courts frequently do not conform and this has given cause for public complaints. . During the year the powers of the Small Court were increased to include land and diving cases involving amounts not exceeding Rs. 400, in the past this court was not authorised to hear diving and land disputes. Shera Courts. The Shera courts, which are religious courts dealing with cases of inheritance, divorce and administration of oaths, are presided over bv the Sunni and Shia Kadis.24 There have been no changes in the Sunni court although there is a certain amount of public discontent at the dilatoriness of the court in completing cases and at the lack of judicial knowledge displayed by the Kadis who are old men without modern education. Comp 1 aints about the Shia Kadis increased during the year and owing to the inefficiency of the court and the allegations which were made against the rectitude o the Kadis the Government instituted various reforms. One of the Kadis, Shaikh Ali bin Jafer, was dismissed from his post and Shaikh Mohamed Ali was appointed in his place and an experienced Kadi, Shaikh Abdul Hussain al Helli, was obtained from Iraq and appointed as appeal Kadi. This arrangement has put an end to the general criticism of the Shia Shera court although there are still intrigues and quarrels between the factions supporting the various Kadis and ex Kadis which affect the impartial administration of justice. This condition however has existed in Bahrain for many years and will continue as long as the Shia Kadis function. At the end of the year the Govenment appointed by proclamation a number of local Shia Ulema from different districts of Bahrain as authorised persons to perform marriages and divorces. In the past such authorization was granted by the Kadis and was the cause of some complaint. The new arrangement gave satisfaction to the Shia community. Municipalities. Revenue ... ... ... 1,12,500 Expenditure ... ... ... 1,05,200 M anama In addition to the routine work of town cleaning and upkeep of roads in the municipal area the Manama Municipality carried out the following works and improvements;— 1. A new road was built running east and west through the main bazaar from the vegetable market to Barrett Street. This is now an important road and con nects two parts of the bazaar which were previously not connected by a direct motor road. A number of shops were demolished or reduced in order to make the road possible. 2. A road was built from the Jufair road to the eastern sea shore passing in front of the Palace. 3. A road was built from the western end of the Sea Road to the new hospital at Is aim. 4. Various roads were resurfaced with mud and a section of the Sea Road from the Customs Square to the Bank was metalled. This work, which was an experiment, was carried out with the aid of the new road roller and tar equipment. The work was incomplete at the end of the year. 5. Five hundred trees were planted along the sides of the town roads and on the Jufair Road. Most of the trees are casuarinas but local trees were also used. 6. A building was constructed at the Power House to contain the new ice plant. 7. Another portion of the water logged land on the south of the town was reclaimed. Standing water in the town and in gardens adjacent to the town and behind the Fort was oiled in order to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. Special spraying pumps were used for this work. 8. An artesian well was sunk in the middle of the bazaar to provide water for the public and for use by the fire brigade in case of a fire. Previously there was no accessible water supply in this area.25 ' 9. Twelve new standard road lamps were installed in the streets. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa was appointed President of the municipal council in place of Shaikh Moharned bin Isa whose frequent absences from Bahrain made it difficult for him to give sufficient time to municipal affairs. Muharraq Municipality. Revenue ... ... 49,500 Expenditure ... ... 51,600 Shaikh Salman bin Hamad was appointed President of the municipal council in place of Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, the latter having taken over the Presidency of the Manama council. The most important work carried out by the municipality was the beginning of a new sea road from the northern end of the existing road to the Boys School. This road will provide for all traffic to Hedd, Busateen and the other villages on Muharraq Island and will obviate the need for such traffic passing through the narrow streets inside the town. It will be of great value if development takes place of Busateen. A number of new shops were commenced on municipal land near the pier. This land has been reclaimed during recent years by the municipality and is now a very valuable building site. Several streets were widened in Muharraq and in Hedd and a portion of the Muharraq bazaar was reroofed. Numerous drains were built from existing artesian wells to carry spare water into the sea. Wakf Departments. Shia Wakf Department. Balance from 1856 ... Rs. 3,283 Revenue 1357 Rs. 18,361 Expenditure „ 17,832 The Shia Wakf Department, functioned without disturbances during the year, the election of a new council was postponed until 1358. There was a decrease in revenue of approximately Rs. 6,000 much of this amount being outstanding debts owing to the Department. The revenue was expended as follows:— Upkeep of Matams ... ... ... Rg. 7,983 Purchases for mosques and charity ... ... „ 1,281 Upkeep of Wakf property, gardens, shops etc. ... ,, 2,324 Payments to mosques and matams ... ... „ 3,463 Part payment for artesian wells on Wakf property ,, 1,000 Departmental Expenses ... ... m 1,148 Sunni Wakf Department. The Sunni Wakf Department, which consists of the three Sunni Kadis who function without a council, reports a revenue of approximately Rs, 21,500 and expenditure of approximately Rs. 20,400. A sum of Rs. 2,194 is owing to the Department by tenants.26 463 11 18 3 146 5 20 1 842 8 116 7 199 4 70 2 90 2 60 2 65 2 Education. 1. Schools. The following Government Schools were open during the school year, which lasts approximately from October until June. Manama ; No. of students No. of teachers^ Boys School ... Technical School Girls School ... Beligions School Muharraq : Boys School ... Girls School ... Hedd Boys School Country Schools: Rafaa Suk al Khamis Budeya Sitra Education in the country schools is confined to reading, writing, arithmetic and Koran, in Manama and Muharraq the curriculum is more advanced and includes English. The majority of the teachers are Bahrain subjects but in Manama and Muharraq, and in the Technical School, the senior teachers are Syrian. 2 Technical School. Satisfactory progress has been made by the students of the Technical school. The first batch of boys who entered the carpentry classes romuleted their two years training and all obtained work, most of them being taken on by the Public Works and Electric Departments who employ a number ot carpenters. These boys are now skilled carpenters and can be definitely certain oi permanent employment in future. A new batch of boys have entered the carpentry class. The engineering students who started working later, have not completed the course which is to include six months practical work with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The Technical School is at present the most satisfactory branch of Govern ment Education but its success is only made possible by paying the students to complete their course. If the boys did not receive an allowance of Rs. 15 per month, of which Rs. 10 is paid monthly and the remainder on completing the two years, their parents would not allow them to remain at school. 8 Religious School. A new school was opened during the year for students of religion and religious law. The school is under the control of Shaikh Abdul Hussein al Helli, 0 the Shia Appeal Kadi. The students are young men mostly beloncnno to the Shia families who in the past have supplied the Kadis of Bahrain. The Shi^a public in the past have frequently represented the need for such an institution. Most of the students live in the country and they too, as in the Technical school, are being given an allowance to cover the cost of coming in to Manama to attend school. 4 Students Abroad. Two more girls have been sent to the British Syrian Training School at Beyrout. There are now three Bahrain girls learning to be school teachers. Two sons of Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa are being educated at the expense of the Bahrain Government at the Beyrout University and one young Shia, son of the late Shia Kadi, Sayed Adnan, is at the Islamieh College Lucknow.27 Shaikh Abdulla bin Hamad spent six months in England with a tutor at Oxford learning English. The cost of this special education was paid by the Government. Several young men from Bahrain are being educated in Iraq and India, at their parents expense. 5. Girls Schools. The number of students at the Manama and Muharraq Girls schools has increased. A new headmistress was appointed in Muharraq who was trained at the British Syrian Training College. Both schools have begun a domestic economy class for the older girls which includes cooking lessons, this is a popular innovation. The new Muharraq school was completed during the year and taken over at the beginning of the school term. It is a light airy building although situated in the middle of the town and surrounded by houses. The progress in the girls schools is on the whole more satisfactory than progress in the boys schools. The girls have no incentive to leave school before completing their whole course and as the age for marriage is becoming later than it used to be many girls remain at school until they are 15 or 16 years old. 6. General. There has been a general increase in the number of students attending government schools so much that the Manama school is now filled to its capacity. The age of the eldest students is considerably younger than it used t; be a few years ago the reason being that as soon as boys acquire a slight knowledge of English and a little general education their parents make them leave school and find employment. This system is most unsatisfactory. Boys leave schools before they are properly trained and without sufficient knowledge and education to rise in the posts which they obtain. Employers of labour complain that boys from the schools are uneducated and therefore not suitable for promotion and the parents complain that because their sons do not obtain rapid promotion the education system must be at fault. Minors Department. For several years the Bahrain Government has been gravely concerned at the mismanagement of the property of orphans and minors by persons appointed bv will or by the Shera courts as guardians of estates. Innumerable cases of misappropriation have become known and frequently guardians and administrators have mads away with all the property entrusted to their care. Ths Shera Kadis, who should protect the rights of minors, acquiesed in this scandaloue:state of affairs and opposed various attempts of the Government to impose legislation to protect the interests of minors. In the spring of 1937 discussions were opened with the Shia Kadis about making a special department for dealing with the estates of minors. The Shia Kadis, very reluctantly, agreed to some form of organisation provided that control was kept in their hands. No effective arrangement was arrived at and the matter lapsed. Shortly afterwards a rich Bahrani died leaving an estate worth about Rs 40,000. The estate was administered by the Shia Kadis and the manner in which it was dealt with caused public comment. Another wealthy man died intestate but before the Kadis began to deal with the estate the heirs of the deceased and a number of prominent Shias requested the Government to act as administrator. A special committee was appointed to divide the estate, which was valued at nearly 1 lakh, and to deal with the share of the minor heirs. The Shia Kadis strongly resented this action but public opinion was in favour of removing the administration from the hands of the Kadis. On 28th March 1938 a number of leading Arabs and Bahrana were invited to attend a meeting, at which Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa presided, to discuss the formation of a regular government department for administering estates of minors. The Shia representatives were unanimous in agreeing to the proposal but one or two of the38 ^ Arabs expressed the views ot the Sunn. Kadis A opposed the proposal becanse they disliked losing control of the revenues ot estates. Several meetings were held and eventually a mixed committee of Sunnis and Shias was appointed' under the presidency of Shaikh Sulman bm Hamad with a permanent clerical staff and an office m the Law courts regulations were drawn up somewhat on the lines of the Department of mmors in Iraq and an account was opened with the Eastern Bank. The department commenced to function in May 1038. The main obiect of the Department has been whenever possible to invest the inheritance of minors in immoveable property and to ensure that the property is cared for. In cases where the funds are insufficient to invest in property the com mittee has allowed money to be lent out on interest provided that reliable mortgages such as house property or gold ornaments are obtainable. During the last ten months the sums dealt with by the Department amounted to about Rs. '68,000. The staff of the Department is paid from state funds and the president and the committee give their services voluntarily. Agriculture. Agricultural survey. In March 1938 K.B. Fateh Ud Din, Deputy Director of Agriculture, Jullunder, visited Bahrain in order to advise the Bahrain Crovern- mentonthe possibility of agricultural development. His services were made avail able by the Government of India who agreed to his proceeding to Bahrain on deputation. The Khan Bahadur spent over 2 months in Bahrain during which he had the opportunity of making a thorough examination of the existing gardens and cultiva tion. Arrangements were made with owners to show him round their estates and in this way he met and had talks with most of the local land owners. Durin^ his visit he sent samples of soil from many different parts of Bahrain for analysis 'in India in order to find out what crops could be raised and what fertilizers should be used. Another matter to which K. B. Fateh Ud Din gave attention was the prevalence of date disease which did much injury to the date crop in 1856. He recommended the Bahrain Government to employ an entomological expert for a season in order to determine the exact nature of the disease and its cure. Phi? proposal was considered but was not adopted on the grounds of expense. The Bahrain Government hoped that the agricultural expert's visit would produce tangible results as the total cost to the State was approximately Rs. 8,500 Unfortunately up to the time of writing this note no report on the result of the investigations has been received and the only advantage from ^ the expert's visit has been a few suggestions and some advice verbally given by K. B. Fateh Ud Din from time to time. Government Experimental Garden. The experimental garden at Budeya was considerably enlarged during the year and an artesian well was drilled in order to give the garden its own water supply. The garden area is now about 5 acres. Potatoes, barley and wheat were grown successfully during spring of 1938 as well as a small quantity of sugar cane and ground nuts. In the autumn of 1938 potatoes and grain crops were planted on a larger scale and with equal success. Experiments have been tried with planting swedes, mangel wurzles, sugar beet and other root crops as well as the ordinary European vegetables which are known to succeed in Bahrain. General. His Highness Shaikh Hamed has continued to put more land under the cultivation at Seddad, near Zellag. During the year thirteen artesian wells were sunk and about 100 acres were planted with date trees and some lucerne. During the three previous year about 80 acres of new land was cultivated.29 In the winter and spring a fairly good supply of European vegetables is now available in the Manama bazaar, produced in local gardens. Locally grown fruit however, excepting dates, is almost non existent. During the last date season there was a very slight recurrence of the date disease which did so much harm during the previous year. Locusts, which used to visit Bahrain in swarms almost every year, have not appeared during the last four or five years. Political Unrest and Press Propaganda. During the latter half of the year there was a state of political unrest in Bahrain. Events in Kuwait and, later, in Dubai contributed towards this condition. Newspaper articles began to appear in the Arab press in the spring attacking the Bahrain administration and showing strongly anti-British tendencies A group of discontented individuals in Bahrain encouraged the so-called educated young men in Manama and Muharraq to believe that they were suffering from various grievances. The movement was mainly among the young Howlis, Sunni Persians resident for more than a generation in Bahrain who form the majority of the shop-keeper class. It was supported by a few older men some of whom believed themselves to be progressive but most of whom were actuated by personal motives and dislike of the existing government. The chief agitators were Ali bin Khalifah al Fadil, who had once been the secretary of the Manama Munici pality but was dismissed in disgrace and later convicted of misappropriating wakf funds, Saad bin Shamlan, a negro wakil in the courts who had been debarred from appearing in court owing to malpractices, Ibrahim bin Abdnlla Kamal, who had done nine months imprisonment for fraud and Ahmed Chirawi another court wakil with an unsatisfactory reputation. These leaders endeavoured to gain the sympathies of the chief Shia merchants of Manama, who had been conferring with the government for some time about reforms in the Shia Shera courts and also tried to enlist the support of leading Arabs in a movement against the Government. The Shia leaders were not drawn into the affair and none of the important Arabs gave the agitators any open support though various individuals were in sympathy with certain items included in the demands which were being discussed. They disapproved of the methods which were used. During the autumn the press compaign in the Egyptian, Syrian and Iraqi papers was intensified and in Bahrain anonymous notices were stuck up in the town. Political meetings were held incessantly. The leaders asked their supporters to demand a legislative council, a committee to take over the education department, the removal of the Khalifah Shaikhs from posts of -magistrates, changes in all departments of the administration including His Highness's private household and innummerable concessions from the Bahrain Petroleum Company including a committee of local merchants to engage labourers and deal with disputes and labour affairs. During Eamadan it was known to the Government that the so-called leaders were canvassing the important Arabs in Hedd and Muharraq to join a movement which was definitely against the Government. On 12th Ramadan three of the chief agitators were arrested. The fourth leader, Ali bin Khalifah attempted during the night to organise a strike of workers at the oil fields. Up to this time no demands had been put forward for the consideration of the Government or addressed to the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Most of the semi-educated youths working as office boys, gangers, motor drivers etc. with the Bahrain Petroleum Company were in sympathy with the movement, though not interested in reforms in the Government services they were induced to join the movement in the expectation of getting higher pay and similar conditions to skilled Indian workmen. The strike was abortive. Pickets of boys who tried to prevent workmen reaching the oil fields were arrested by His Highness's retainers and although a number of labourers failed to attend their work, having been told that no work would be done that day, the routine of the Company was not interrupted.30 In Manama a meeting was held in the Jumaa Mosque presWed over by AH bin Khalifah who harangued a crowd of sev^al J , 0 ^ S n Xfti,m or dm,,- the shopsto shut ''This'wis expected and thTpolice who according to their cojom 'JrV broken A number of arrests were made and Ali bin Khalifah surrendered himself in the evening. The bazaar was patrolled by Police and by some of His Highness s Arab retainers and within an hour normal conditions were resurnec. From the time of the arrests there were no more disturbances m Bahrain . The prisoners were tried in the Bahrain and Agency courts, some were Persians and the maiority of the others Howlis. Sentences ranging from one month hard labour to 24 years hard labour followed by '2J year exile, in the case of Ah bin Khabfah, were imposed. From the time the arrests were made the press compaign in the Arabic news- oanerss rose to a crescendo of violence and vituperation to which was added wireless propaganda from the Royal Palace in Baghdad. Much of the abiise nv as dn ected •iirainst the Adviser who was described as an infamous dictator. he condition &gt;. Bahrain was compared to that of Palestine and it was implied that Bahrain uas panting for protection from Iraq and fantastic descriptions were published about the barbarous ill treatment of the political prisoners who in fact are considerably more healthy than when they were admitted to jail. The press compaign continues. The political unrest was caused by a number of reasons. It was combination of conditions and circumstances the chief of them being nationalism youth move ment and dissatisfaction with labour conditions all aggravated by wireless and press propaganda and fomented by people who expected to reap personal advancement iy upsetting the existing administration. Undoubtedly it was an echo of events m Palestine, Kuwait and Dubai. At the end of the year, during the accession celebration His Highness re ferred in a public speech to the recent disturbances. He deplored the behaviour of a section of his subjects and assured the public that any reasonable suggestion for reforms or improvements would be given thorough consideration by His Government provided that it was put forward in a suitable and seemly manner. General Distinguished Visitors. H. E. H. Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, and the Earl of Athlone accompanied by Lord Frederic Cambridge and Mr. Gault, visited Bahrain in March 193B on their way to Europe from Saudi Arabia. They spent neveral days in Bahrain, they were entertained by His Highness at Sakhir and they visited the oil fields and other places of interest. His Highness presented Princess Alice and Lord Athlone with a pair of Arab horses. This is the first time that a member of the English Royal Family has visited Bahrain. Other notable visitors during the year included: Rear Admiral J. F. Somerville, C.B., D.S.O., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron. Rear Admiral Herbert Fitz-Herbert C.B., C.M.G., Flag Officer Royal Indian Marine. H. E. Shaikh Hafiz Wahaba, Saudian Minister to London. The Honourable Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle K.C.I.E., C. B. E. H. E. The Vicar Apostolic of Arabia and Bishop of Gaza, Monsignor J. B Tirinnanzi. The Ruler of Dubai.31 Appointments. Dr I. Davenport Jones was appointed as Medical Officer to the State and commenced work on 13th July 1938. Dr. M. M. McDowall, m.b , was appointed as Woman Doctor to the State and commenced work on 21st February 1939. Mr Mohammed Dowagher was transferred from the Land Registration Department and appointed Superintendent of the Minors Department. His Highness's Indian Visit. During the summer H. H. Shaikh Hamad accompanied by several of his sons and Dr R. Holmes, m.b.e , travelled to Kashmir where he spent two months recuperating after his serious illness. Shaikh Salman bin Hamad and Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa visited Egypt during the year and Shaikh Abdullah spent sometime in Syria. Bahrain Theatre Company. The cinema owned by the company was opened in the summer. A different picture is shown every week, Indian, Egyptian, and American films are exhibited in rotation. Films are subject to Government censor ship but so far only one has been prohibited as being likely to offend local taste. It is understood that the venture is proving a financial success. Bahrain Camels in Edinburgh. His Highness presented the Edinburgh Zoo with a pair of young camels, which were successfully conveyed to Scotland. There are already three Bahrain donkeys in the Edinburgh Zoo. Government Rest House. The gross profit from the Rest House during 1357 was approximately Rs. 400 but this amount was absorbed by the depreciation on furniture etc. Over seventy people stayed at the Rest House during the year and their com ments on the accomodation and messing were complimentary. The charge per head per day is Rs 15. Apart from Government guests tha majority of the visitors were representatives of commercial firms. Repatriation of Indigents. During the month of Safar a large number of foreign beggars and indigent persons, who had landed in Bahrain without passports, were rounded up and repatriated by the Bahrain Government to their home countries.' Most of these people were from the Persian coast. They included several lepers and diseased persons. Electric Supply Department. Report by Mr. W. B. Steele, State Engineer. I. Generation. Units generated for the year 1357 showed an increase of 67,765 over 1356. Units sold and used on works for the year 1357 showed an increase of 49,397 units over 1356. This was due to extra connected load amounting to approximately 61 k.w. The nature of the new load connected during 1357 was as follows:— Lighting and fans (919 points) 40 . 0 Power (motors) Refrigerators A. C. units 18.5 1.0 1.5 61.0 Revenue from units sold during compared with Rs. 81,885-13-0 in 1356. 1357 amounted to Rs. 102,811-4-0 as32 Increase Ks. 20,926-7-0. 174 new premises were connected during 1367 In Manama ^ In Muharraq 1 ^ Total consumers connected to date 1112. Maximum load, recorded 203 k.w. Total kilowatts connected to date 420. Capacity of generating plan 400 k.w. Wiring Contracts. The local wiring contractors contmned wiring in the State during 1357. Premises were wired as follows (1) Haji Salman Al-Zayani 143 (2) Haji Khalil Kanoo 6 (3) Haji Yousuf Fakhroo 1 Another local merchant Haji Yousuf Al-Moayed, was licensed in 1356. The Department carried out the following wiring of Government and certain other premises : Shaikh Salman bin Hamed's House and Majhs at Sukhir. Government Girls School at Muharraq. Shaikh Daij, Shaikh Mubarak, and Shaikh Ahmed's houses at Sukhir. H.H. Sir Shaikh Hamed's Majlis at Sukhir. New married quarters at Manama Fort (Police). New Dispensary and Doctor s quarters at Nairn. Several other smaller premises, Temporary Wiring. During the 1357 the Cities of Manama and Muharraq were specially illuminated on the occasion of the anniversary of the accession ol H H. Sir Shaikh Hamed Al-Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain. 2500 extra lights were temporarily installed. Mains Extensions. A 3/phase pole line was run to Manama 1 echnical School on Daly Road to the Bahrain (Cinema) Theatre (approximately 500 yards). V lighting service was run along Prior Road from Fakhroo's Amara at Nairn to the Junction of Shaikh Hamed and Prior Roads, a distance of approxima- tely 660 yards. The Fort water pumps were connected by means of a pole line from a point 'C' substation (approximately 400 yards). Alterations to Mains. Three poles were diverted on Belgrave Road in via.mina. This was necessary owing to the widening of the town street. One span of the H.T. overhead line crossing Shaikh Mustafa's premises at Ras Rmnman was removed and an underground cable substituted. New Generating Set. A new 6-cylinder 300 B.H.P. Generating set (Mirr- lees Bickerton &amp; Day) direct-coupled to a 200 k.w. 3300 % alternator was erected and put on load in June 1938. Air Conditioning. Air conditioning was introduced into Manama in 1357, the unit system being adopted, each room to be conditioned having a separate unit in it. The first unit installed proved a success and the Government has a number of units which can be hired to the public at Rs. 30 per month (for a minimum period of six months per annum). near Manama.33 The following residences etc., are being supplied with units for the summer of 3358.

Central Plant. The Jufair Naval Base Authorities also contemplate conditioning the Officer's mess and Canteen. As Bahrain is intensely hot during the summer months (the wet bulb tempe rature being as high as any in the world) air conditioning will be welcomed. II. Government Telephone Department. The number of subscribers connected to date is 67, and it is expected that more will be added during 1358. A new 50 line Exchange has been ordered to meet future demands and the oldest of the present three boards will be removed and utilised in the New Hospital for internal telephones. This Department is at present self supporting. III. Transport Department. The motor-repair shop is now too small to meet increased requirements and two new bays are being added also a ramp for car cleaning, and inspection purposes. The number of Government vehicles in service is twenty-two, including two road rollers and two fire engines. IV. Fire Department. A number of fires were extinguished by the Fire Department during the year and further suction pits are being arranged in the town of Manama for fire purposes. Two new spray nozzles have been ordered to deal with oil fires (or small local outbreaks) when the main jets, if applied, would only serve to spread the burning material. V. Traffic Section. 120 drivers were examined for driving licenses during 1357. out of which 80 passed. Road accidents were considerably less during 1357 due to :— (a) Bye tests being compulsory (annually). (b) The standard of driving (although not very high) being better. (c) Police supervision has improved, due to the traffic section becoming more acquainted with their duties. VI. Municipal Ice Plants. The two one-ton ice plants of the Manama Municipality were operated as usual by the State Engineer's Department. 250 tons of ice was made and sold during the hot weather season of 1357. A profit was made by the Municipality on the sale of the ice.34 — . j f arnentrv School. The training VII. Government Engineering H 5 1S57 and daring the G ~- ment Departments. Th. Muharraq »llo.

O^ all the other of collections the fall in receipts averages thirteen and a third per cent. S.ie. 4 -4 r - S* »s? 2 iwu'cr The Bahrain Petroleum Coy., Ltd. Neither of these anticipations was realised, and consequently the bazaar became over-stocked. Another factor accounting to some degree for the decrease in receipts, particularly from steamers' cargoes, is the gradual but steady de '' 11 ?®J 11 ® ^cent Lie orices of principal commodities, which ranges from ten to twentyj)er cent This may in some part, be due to market fluctuations; but it is also thought locally that another slump may be developing. It is unlikely that the receipts from Direct Transhipments will ever again anproach the figure'of 1357, because the Saudi-Arabian port of Has lanura is being ranidlv developed by the California Arabia Standard Oil Company, to facilitate its own workL ; and steamers with cargo for this Company will in future proceed direct to Ras Tanura, although the channel is tortuous and dangerous. 1 he hist such steamers was the s.s. ' Ockenfels ' a Hansa Line ship direct from New York which called there on 7th January, 1939, Consequently the port of Bahrain will not collect the 13% Direct Transhipment duty previously levied upon the cargoes such steamers. The decrease in receipts from Native Craft cargoes may to some small extent be acconned for by the cessation of the on-carrying trade between this port and the State of Qatar. J understand that such trade has been diverted hence to I) bai. The decrease in Import Yard receipts is consistent with the decrease in the collections from steamers' cargoes. The schedule of Import Yard charges for Khanchia and Porterage was drawn iid manv years by a committee of local merchants with more enthusiasm than breadth of vision ; and numerous adjustments and definitions have been made from time to time. Since Khanchia is a charge mamly for space occupied by a package, and Porterage is an in-and-out charge for removing cargo it seemed desirable to simplify the numerous varying rates. Accordingly, on the 1st of Jamad al Awa , (c/w 29th June 1938), all the old rates for package cargo were abolished, and a new flat rate of one anna per cubic foot was levied. This procedure has considerably simplified the cashiers' work, and also enables all importers to understand the dues levied upon their packages. For some time past there has been levied a stampage of one rupee upon each Bill of Entry and a half-rupee upon each Shipping-Bill. 1 his charge was considered to be somewhat higher than is suitable and it was found to press rather heavily upon the small importer. Consequently it has been decided for the year 1358 to levy a stampage Teight annas upon 'each class of Bill, which will result in a drop in Miscellaneous receipts.i)3 45 III. Movement of Steamers. During the year 1357, three hundred and fifty-one steamers visited Bahrain, as com pared with three hundred and forty-six in • 56, and two hundred and hfty-one in 1355, an increase of one hundred steamers m two years.

I \ Native ( raft. I he visits of Native Craft to this port are compared as below:— Original Year 1357. Arabian Mainland Kuwait Oman Coast Iran Coast Iraq India Africa The decrease in calls from the Arabian Mainland is probably due to the cessation of the on-carrying trade between Bahrain and Qatar. The decrease in Iraq craft may be to the local failure of the flour-milling industry, and the decrease in African craft is undoubtedly due to the local slump in the boat-building industry, not nearly so much fish-oil being demanded locally. The above figures do not include the ferry service between Bahrain &amp; Zekrit of the launch of Petroluem Concessions Ltd., nor the regular launch mail service between Bahrain and Hassa.ns 49 Lighting of the Port. The past year brought an increa-ed use of the Sitrah anehorage, which was developed for the use of the tankships loading the exports of the Bahrain Petroluem Coy. Ltd., and for the warships of H. B. Ms Royal Navy Base at Jnfair. c , . , ^ a( ^^ on ^ has now become the regular anchorage of the steamers of the Strick Tjine and the llansa Line which visit this port; but the steamers of the B. I. S. IS. ( oy. Ltd., and the Mitsui and \amashita l^ines still prefer to use the Man am ah anchorage as it is more convenient, except when a high shurnal is raging. In addition to the shallowness of the shore approaches at Sitrah. the channel itself was ill-lit; and consequently night-work was difficult. This difficulty has now been o\eiccme by the construction of lixed light beacons on both sides of the channel, so that now, with the beacons and buoys previously established, this anchorage may be regarded as practically satisfactory. At the Manamah anchorage, it is satisfactory to report that, after many \ears, the Persian Gulf Lighting Authority have replaced the dumb buoy at the West Spit near the Fesht al Yarim with a white Hash-light; and the value of this service is undeniable, since the West Spit Buoy light, and the Gray Paul beacon light and the Customs (Manamah) Pier Light are all in transit. To complete the lighting scheme of this anchorage, there is needed a flash-light on the North-East bastion of the Portuguese Fort, which would enable steamers to make a bearing while in range of the Outer Light-ship, in conjunction with the Manama Pier Light, and the Muharraq Pier Light, which, nowadays, is very difficult to do. In this connection it is well to recall that 'the Manamah Pier Light is rated in the Admiralty Sailing Directions as ' an occasional li^ht, lighted upon request Although a request is never received, it has been the practice to show this light when ever a steamer is expected or is lying in port. The light consists of two 250-watt lamps whose current is supplied by the Electrical Department, and its cost is borne by the Customs. Owing to steamers' visits being now more frequent, the cost of this light has increased—thus; Manamah Pier Lights. Year 1353 Year 1354 Year 1355 Year 1356 Year 1357 Rs. 723 8 0 776 8 0 1,098 8 0 1,283 8 0 1,336 0 0 Total for five years lis. 5,218 0 0 This is very expensive, the explanation being the prire of the current supplied, namely eight annas per unit, that is, the same cost for outdoor public lighting as for indoor private lighting. Since no light dues are charged to steamers using the port, it is questionable whether the Customs Department can afford to bear this expense, and maintain the service, which is desireable, unless the rate is reduced. The lighting expenses incurred by this Department during the year 1357, including the cost of lamps, kerosene, and services of electricians for adjustments amounted to:— Office Ware-houses Es. Manamah &amp; ) Muharraq Piers j Khore Light 706 204 1,705 0 125 0 0 0 Total Rs. 2,830 0 0 Even at the above expense, the Manama Pier System is not adequately lit; and for this reason, for the future, I propose the installation of the ' Osira ' system recently perfected for public lighting by the General Electric Company which, although the initial installations are somewhat more expensive than the old-fashioned material now in use, promises more illumination with less consumption of current.50 General. It is pleasing to report that the heavy construct^ planned by Government for 1357 mcloded an extens.on head which construction of a mole 1,250 feet long by \ i P tn thi&gt; Pier independently of will lie in the deep water, and enable access to be ^de to the I .er mdepende ^ the tides.

Careo will be landed straight on to the trolleys, and removedd .rectly to the sheds, instead of lying upon the Pier as at j 0 to Se ^ a g 7rnted B to the that this improvement will enable delivery of their imports to oe g public at least one day earlier. This imnrovement will involve night-work on Customs premises and t e nf arpldv incre-ised consumption of electric current; hence it would seem aarwss rsas. «&lt;•- •»» Mention must also be made of attention having been given to ^ iron -work at least once a } ear. For this reason it is suggested that all iron-work should be re-painted during ■t ocq an( i a 'dump course' be applied to the new Custom House, which on re- cfaimedtnd is found to be a damp building. The provision of same good office furniture and certain minor adjustments in this building may al^o be suggest . Establishment.

IV. Public Works. a. Manama-Muharraq Causeway. Tenders for the swing bridge between . r 3 Aiph'irr in have not been received at the time of writing this leport. Three lakhs has been allocated for this work and Rs. ;35 000 for the cost of extending the road from each end to the site of the bridge. Ihe bridge itself will probably be ahnnt 005 feet long leaving about 300 feet of road on each side to be completed. It Sel/thatlf Citable tender is accepted the work will begin in October. hState Hosoital. The Hospital will consist of four large separate buildings of which only one, the Dispensary and Medical Officer's flat, has been almost completed. Rs. 10,000 covers outstanding bills and completion of drainage and building.

Each section is 200 feet long and costs approximately Rs. 11,000, five sections, including the cross piece, remain to be done Included in the above amount is the cost of new rails for the trolley line both on the pier extension and the existing pier up to the import shed in the bazaar. The nier work is being carried out by direct labour, when tenders were called for the amounts quoted were so fantastic that it was impossible to do the work by contract. The extension is not a necessity but if being done in order to provide work for a number of men and boatmen who would otherwise be unemployed during the season when there is no diving. d. Fort, Bs. 40,000. The fort is gradually being rebuilt to suit the requirements of the Police force The old walls which were built of mud and small stones are being replaced by solid stone and cement walls. The N E tower is to be rebuilt in a similar way to the N.W. tower and the eastern wall which is now a crumbling ruin is to be replaced by a solid wall. A new barrack room is needed to accomodate the extra men who have been enlisted.57 A water storage tank is needed for irrigating the north part of the garden. The entrance and guard room are in a dangerous condition, being part of the original building. More married quarters are required but this year they have been post poned. An ammunition magazine is to be built underneath the new tower to hold the increased quantity of ammunition which is now kept in the armoury. C- Schools, Rs. 10,000. The open yard on the west of the technical school is to be roofed and made into another room and a walled compound is to be built on the south of the school This space is required to accommodate the Muharraq carpentry class which has been transferred to Manama. ^ r j ^ ixat. ueeu The Manama school is now not large enough to accomodate the students and two new class rooms and an office and store are to be added by utilising part of the existing veranda and the bays of the central hall. The class rooms are overcrowded stuffy and in some cases badly lighted. ' It is proposed to build a two room school at Naim for the religious school which ls at present in the house of the Appeal Kadi, Shaikh Abdul Hue,sain. A plot of land, which is said to be \\ akf, will be utilised for this purpose. /• Transport Building Rs. 10,000. &lt; .u T 4 W « ,le ' parages are to be added to the transport building with rooms above for the staff. The existing garages are not sufficient to accommodate the number of cars which are dealt with by the Department. g. Passport Office. The building now used as a passport office and telephone exchange has been let to the Indian Postal authorities as a post office. A new pass port office is to be built on the ground immediately west of the customs house facing the customs square. ' ^ The old building is to be repaired and made suitable for a post office. The telephone exchange will remain where it is but a new staircase will be built to the telephone office which will be shut off from the post office. i i J* 7 0Uld to lefc building on very advantageous terms to local shopkeepers but in the mterest of the general public the Government haslet ne milding to the Postal authorities at a low rent in order that the Post Office should be in the centre of the town. h Miscellaneous- The wooden stairs at the Palace which lead from the ground to the first floor are narrow, low, awkward and undignified. They are to bo replaced by a flight of stone stairs outside the central tower leading up to the centre archway which will be used as an entrance. There is no water supply at Hawar except the old cisterns or catchments which were built many years ago by the people of Hawar. Most of the cisterns are out of repair and do not hold water. They are to be repaired A 8ma ^ mos( l ue is be built in the northern village which will be used bv the Police garrison and the inhabitants. Certain bills are outstanding for the building of the Gozabia House which has been let to the H.B.M's Political Agent and is occupied by the Assistant Political Agent. A drain to the sea to carry off surplus and used water from irrigation channels is required at the Budeyaa experimental garden. ^ u The I P J ublic ii works P^gramme is a heavy one, apart from the Manama- Maharraq bridge all work is done directly by the Department and it is probable that not all the items will be undertaken during the year.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024152683.0x000007_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/750/3</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024152683.0x000007</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/750/3</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Government of Bahrain Annual Report for Year 1357 (March 1938 - February 1939)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-24T00:34:42</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (39 folios)</extent><extent>This file contains an index (folio 84r) which references pages of the report.</extent><extent>Foliation: Folios 82-121.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume is the Annual Report of the Government of Bahrain for the year 1357 AH (1938-1939) and gives te details of the Revenue and Expenditure of the Bahrain State and contains notes on the activities of the various Government departments, as well as the budget 1358 and some particulars of importance which took place in Bahrain during the year.
