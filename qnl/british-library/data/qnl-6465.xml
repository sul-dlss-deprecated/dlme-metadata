I ventured to give it as my opinion that should the Karoun be opened to free navigation, the road of the future was by Kharamabad and Burujird. Since my return to Teheran, Mr. Schindler has kindly lent me a copy of the paper he contributed to the Berlin Geographical Society (Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde zu Berlin, vol. 14), in which he describes the Khoramabad, Burujird, and Dizful road, and as the subject may hereafter have some importance, I beg to submit a brief summary of his statements. Mr. Schindler went several times over this road (in 1877 and 1878), he is a careful observer and has a thorough knowledge of Persia, so that his remarks cannot fail to be of great value. There are two roads from Burujird to Khoramabad, one Mr. Schindler travelled over and describes, the other which is that taken by Baron Bode, and is only inhabited in the summer months. Burujird to Kelangane. —19J miles. Road good. Leaving Burujird by the Barbaz gate, the road runs south-east along the left bank of the Tehej or Burujird river to Chelanshulan. Country well watered. Chelanshulan contains 120 families, and is the principal village of the Yar Ahmedi Lurs. The road then runs 1^ miles through swampy meadows and crosses the river; 1J miles further on the village of Kelangane (50 houses) is reached. There is another road from Burujird to Kelangane by Gushe and Bozana, distance 23 miles. Kelangane to Zaghe, called also Kale-i-Haidar Khan.—17J miles. Road bad as far as Gerdeneh-i-Razan, good after that. One and a half miles from Kelangane the road enters a narrow valley, and there, leaving the village of Azizabad on the left, mounts rapidly in a southern direction. Pine view from summit of pass. Prom thence two miles to Razan, a large village with 200 families. Two miles further on the road enters the valley of the Horud, which is about 12 miles broad and 20 miles long. The Horud runs north west through the plain of Aliaschter, then turns west, and below Khoramabad falls into the Keshgan, which in turn runs into the, Seimerre. Ascent to ZaghA Zaghe to Khoramabad. —22J miles. Road indifferent. Over the Zaghd pass, which is difficult in winter on account of snow, to the Abistane valley, inhabited by Segvend Lurs. Road enters scanty oak forest, passes through the Derre-i-Diraz, and enters the Deh-i-Pir plain. Passing the ruins 'of several water mills, road enters the Kemalbend valley, which runs in a north-west direction to Khoramabad. One and a half miles out of the latter place the road crosses the river by a two-arched bridge, and following the left bank enters the town. Distance from Burujird, 58J miles, There are only 36 villages in Luristan, most of the inhabitants being nomads. In 1876-77 the revenue amounted to Ts. 64,000. It is well nigh impossible to state the number of the inhabitants, but the Government calculate 39,550 families. The Lur tribes are divided into Pisch-i-Koh and Puscht-i-Koh. 7118. 1.1825. ASilsile Tribes. '' 1. Gbijasvend, nearly extinct. 2. Hassauyend, 16 branches and 2,500 families. Winter quarters in the Taidar plain. Summer quarters in the Aliaschter plain. 3. Kulivend, inhabit the Chawe plain, three branches, 2,500 families. 4. Yusufvend, 16 families, inhabit Aliachter. Dilfan Tribes. 1. Mumuvend. 12 branches, 2,000 families, inhabit Teng-i-Bedavir. 2. Kakavend. Five branches, 2,000 families, inhabit Daremrud, south of Kerman shah. 3. Mietivend. 10 branches, 500 families, inhabit south of Kermanshah. 4. Ainevend. Four branches, 80 families, inhabit Teng-i-Piri. From Khoramabad to Dizful there are five roads :— 1. The largest (50 farsakhs) practicable for artillery. Follows the right bank of the Keshgan river to the Teng-i-Dobatchi, crosses the Shahpur bridge to the Yaidar plain, then into the Kerkhe valley to Pul-i-Teng; across the Ab-i-Zal to Rezze, Bidruye, and Ilusseinieh, over the Baladrud river to Dizful. 2. Mr. Schindler’s road from Khoramabad through the Chimishk pass to Dehliz, then to the right by Badamek and Yelmian to the Dum-i-Chul pass, and into road No. 1. 3. Mr. Schindler’s road, as above, to Dehliz, then to the left through Mich vend over the Kialan pass to Ab-i-Zal, and into road No. 1. 4. As above, to Michvend over the Sovaran mountains to Ab-i-Zal. Seldom traversed, and only by foot passengers. 5. The shortest, Sir Henry Bawlinson’s road, from the Chimishk pass over the Koh-i-Gird, the Koh-i-Biab, and the Mungerre by Kirab to Bidruge, from thence as by road No. 1. Khoramabad to ShaMnshah. —Eight miles. Hoad good. When the river is low the road along the right bank as far as the village of Geldan is usually selected, but in spring, when the water is deep, it is necessary to keep on the left bank. Shahinshah is situated on the slopes of the Bowi hills, and con tains about '10 houses. Shahinshah to Chimishk. —15 miles. Road very bad. Ascend Bowi range to a height of 5,900 feet; then descent to the Sheerab river, which has to be crossed. It falls into the Keshgan. Fine oaks were observed in the valley. Ascent again to the summit of the Sheerab pass, 5,550 feet. The road then enters the well wooded Dadabad plateau, w r hich has an average altitude of 5,900 feet. The appropriately called Nal Shikenendeh (Horse-shoe Making pass) leads into the Chimishk valley, in which pasture is plentiful, but timber scarce. The rivers which water this valley are the Rigan and the Kepkan, which meet in the Chimishk gorge and form the Taj in river, which falls into the Keshgan. The altitude of the valley is 5,465 feet, that of the gorge •5,200 feet. Chimishk to Nasrabad. —15^ miles. Road very bad. For five miles after leaving the Chimishk pass the road runs along the southern side of the Ghazal mountains to the Kale-i-Surkh; then turning to the south and crossing the Tajin river ascends the north-west end of the Koh-i-Gird and enters the district of Dur Kurun. The direct road goes south to Ab-i-Serd, but as no supplies are obtainable there it is necessary to turn off and go to Nasrabad. Nasrabad to Badamek. —164 Road bad. After passing Ab-i-Serd the road ascends the Dehliz pass (5,740 feet), and is very stony. At the foot of the pass is a small sprifig. The nearest road goes from here to the left. Mr. Schindler, however, chose one to the right known as Chul (the desert) which runs in a north-west direction to Badamek, where there are several streams flowing south. ^ 7118. A 2JBadamek to Velmian. —13 j miles. Koad fairly good. The oak forest here ceases and only a few oleander and tamarisk bushes appear. Two miles out one passes the Pinabad mountains, and, leaving the road which leads to Yaidar on the right, one reaches the Yelmian river, which flows into the Seimerre. Mr. Schindler states in a note that in his opinion the site of the ancient town of Shahpurkhast must be sought for on the Yaidar plain. Ibn Haukal places it 22 farsakhs from Nehavend. The old bridge in the Yaidar plain is called Pul-i-Shahpur; there are numerous ruins about. Velmian to Chem-i-Gez. —17J miles. Road bad. 4J miles out of Yelmian the road runs over the Dum-i-Chul pass and into the Kerkhi valley. It then runs along the ancient paved way called the Rah-i-Rustem. A few miles further on Bagh-i-Khan, mentioned by De Bode, is passed, the Pani or Velmian river is crossed, and the precipitous mountain called the Tilan-i- Giringe has to be ascended. Two miles from the camp the road crosses the Leilum river, which comes down from the north from the Mishvend plateau and passes the ruined village of Chem-i-Girdab. Then three miles further one through the Derre-i-Khazine to the plain of Youzar. After which the road continually over boulders. Vul-i-Teng to Kalc-i-Rczze. —15 miles. Road bad. Leaving the Seimerre (or Keskhe) river the road runs east to the Gunjab valley, where it is joined by the one leading from Kialan. The Ab-i-Zal, which a little below the ford joins the Seimerre, is then crossed, Kale-i-Rezze being miles further on. Route No. 3 from Khoramabad, which goes more to the east, and is somewhat shorter, separates from the road above described at the fourth stage out, and joins it again at Rezze. The following is the itinerary :— Nasrabad to Moukhbirabad. —16| miles. Road very bad. After leaving Dehliz the road passes the Kebut-i-Moukhtar and the Buk-i-Buland, and descends into the Mishvend valley, to a place where Mr. Schindler built a telegraph station, and called it Moukhbirabad. Moukhbvrabad to JPirinjzar. —19J miles. Road very bad. Two and a half miles out the road enters the Takht-i-Chum plateau, at the end of which is the river which comes down from the Mungerreh mountains. Prom the river to the summit of the pass, over the Kialan, it is five miles. The road over the Kialan is very bad, and dangerous for animals. Two and a half miles further on after getting over the Kialan one gets to Pirinjzar, situated on the Pairab river. Pirinjzar to Rezze. —I7f miles. Road bad. Pive miles a half from the the camp the road joins the one described above. Rezze to Raladrud river. —22| miles. Road bad. Por 4* miles the road passes over boulders till a small river is reached, which flows through the Bidrug&amp; plain, and falls into the Kirab. A little further north-east the plain of Kirab begins. The road then crosses the Varan Tushmal mountains, passes the small waterfall known as Tik-tik-Ab, and then turning north east reaches the ruined karavanserai of Husseinieh. The road is fairly free from boulders, and grass is plentiful. Prom Husseinieh it is eight miles to the ford over the Beladrud (224 feet). This river is said to rise in the Mungerreh mountains, and falls into the Dizful river a little below r the town. Raladrud to Dizful .—18 miles. Road good. The river has first to be forded, and the road there runs nearly due east to the fine plain called the Salirai Lur, and then to Dizful. Summary qf Distances.

The country is insecure, and Mr. Schindler was several times molested by the Lurs, but things are apparently better now than they were some years ago, as the tribes have been cowed by the energetic action of the Zil-es-Sultan, who put several of their chiefs to death. As long as the Elkhani of the Bakhtyaris, Hussein Kuli Khan, lives, his country will be safe for travellers who put themselves under his protection, but, as I have pointed out elsewhere, there is every probability that, on his death, the Bakhtyaris will again return to their predatory habits, and their country would then be no safer, if as safe, as Luristan.
