Dow encloses a copy of a letter, dated 10 April, from the Resident at Bushire, William Bruce, to Thompson, a letter which Dow speculates has not been received by Thompson, as a result of the unfortunate fate of the vessel by which it was transmitted. The Resident's letter is not included here, but it can be found earlier in the volume (see ff 36v-37).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000058#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
