In case there may be any development of the movement, I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India, an extract from the last Maskat Diary dated 24th May, dealing with an embryo rising against the Sultan on the part of certain disaffected tribes of the Wadi Maawal and the Nazwah district. Ca8FD Extract from Maskat Agency Diary No. 21-486 for the week ending 24fh May /p/j. Several reports have been received by His Highness the Sultan during the week from Rustaq, Nazvah and other places to the effect that what may prove to be a powerful rising is forming in those quarters under the ring-leadership of the Chief Abadhi Shaikh. Abdu lla bin Hamed as Salimi, who, himself an old and almost blind man, wishes to proclaim a religious war against the Sultan with the object of setting up his son-in-law Salim bin Ra&amp;hid, as Imam of Oman, the cause being the supposed leaning of the Sultan to Foreign Governments and institutions. This faction comprises the tribes of Bani Riyam Ibriyin and the Bani Hina ] tribes of Jabal-Riyam and Wadi-al-Maawal; the troubles originated at the village f of Tanuf, near Nazwah, and it is supposed that the rebels might come down on Nazwah and Rustaq as both of these places are said to be insufficiently garrisoned by His Highness the Sultan's askaris. His Highness the Sultan seems perturbed at these manifestations and is taking steps to strengthen his garrisons at Nazwah and Rustaq with men and provisions, but it is feared that he may be unable to do so, as it is believed that the communications are in the enemies' hands. ^ Letters received subsequently and transmitted by His Highness to the Political Agent show that the ring-leader is already calling himself the Imam of the Muslims and has been trying to persuade the Chiefs of the Bani Ruwaha and other smaller neighbouring tribes to join his cause. *CD Egyptian newspapers 258.

With reference to Diary entry No. 190, His Highness' Steam Yacht proceeded to Masna with Saiyid Nadir and Hamad on board returning on the 26th evening. It was said that they would collect men and proceed to Rustaq. 205. On the 27th some of His Highness' tupchis left by overland for Bidbith where they will join Saiyid Nadir. The same day news reached Maskat that Bani Ibriyin, an influential tribe, had forsaken the Imam Salim bin Rashid A1 Kharusi. 206. On the 29th news reached Maskat that fighting had taken place at Nizwa between the forces of His Highness and those of the Imam. The number of casualties was 12 killed from His Highness' forces. The report said that Wali Saif bin Hamed Saiyidi was wounded and the 2 forts were occupied by His Highness' men and the Masjid by the VVali. 207. Letters received by His Highness on the 26th, 27th, 30th and 31st said that there was no news from Sharqiyah as to the people joining the rebels or to the contrary. Letter received on the 27th stated that an attack was imminent from those outside and the people of Nizwa were vigilant. Subsequent letters received stated that the people from the quarter of Al Muddah proved treacherous and allowed the enemy to enter their quarter but not without resistarce from the Wali of Nizwa and the loyal portion of the people. Reports received on the morning of the 31st say that the injury received by the Wali is slight. That the strength of As-Salami and his Imam has not increased beyond that the Bani Riyam and Bani Hinna have entered the town of Nizwa and have gained possession of the quarters thereof by the treachery of the inhabitants. The 3 strong positions—the 2 forts and the Masjid and the Beyt Salit—are still fighting. 208. S. Y. ' Nur-ul-Bahr ' left for Masna on the evening of the 30th with provisions and arms and returned on the morning of the 31st. She is taking in coal. The 4 Nur ul-Bahr ' left later for Sur, where it is reported that the family of the Amir of Ja'a-lan have come and His Highness fears that they must be contemplating an attack on the Bani Bu Hassan. All these disturbances are causing His Highness much anxiety. c3ofd~44—i9-6-i3—gcbp Simlai V. '&lt;4 1 CONFIDENTIAL Ck 3 No. 1887, dated Bushire, the 15th (received 23rd) June 1913.

In continuation of my letter No. 1829 of the 8th instant, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, extracts from the k/\ diary of the Political Agent, Maskat, for the week ending 7th instant, in regard /1 1 to the unrest in the interior of the Sultan of Maskat's dominions. 1 1 | Extract from Maskat News No. 23-543 for the week ending 7th June 1913. ' Nur-ul-Bahr ' returned on that Sur at least is quiet Condition of Country. 215. With reference to Diary entry No. 208, the the 2nd with the Wali of Sur on board. This shows and causes His Highness no anxiety. 216. On the 3rd news reached Maskat that His Highness 5 man Ambar, who was proceeding to Nizwah with 15 others with 21 bags rice, 3,000 rounds ammu nition and $i 00 in cash, had been looted and murdered by the rebels and two •others wounded. 217. On the 2nd the ' Nur-ul-Bahr left for Sib with the VVali of Sur and about 100 fighting men on board. From Sib they were to go to Bidbith. The Nur-ul-Bahr' returned to Maskat on the evening of the same day. 218. On the 4th His Highness received a letter from Rustaq written by his relation, Ahmed bin Ibrahim, to the effect that the Baiyt Salit and the Tower had fallen in the hands of the rebels. The letter also mentioned that the only 2 positions that remained to His Highness were the fort and the Masjid. 219. His Highness states that the next objective of the Imam and his following will be Rustaq. Ahmed bin Ibrahim is between the devil and the deep sea, as he cannot withstand the Imam and is afraid to ask help from his High ness as the result of a successful defence of Rustaq with the help of His High ness would be, he fears, that Rustaq would revert to the Sultan. 220. On the 5th news reached Maskat that the rebels had taken the Fort of Nizwah and thatlthe Wali, Saif bin Hamedh, had shot himself before the rebels entered the fort. He wrote a note to His Highness in which he stated that he died by his own hand. 221. On the night of the 4th His Highness, hearing that some sympathisers of the Imam who had come from Zanzibar were taking arms for the Imam by a sailing boat, despatched Saiyid Taimur in the steam cutter after them. Saiyid Taimur overtook the dhow and brought it to Maskat. Three men were imprisoned and the arms and money found with them taken charge of. The arms were purchased from French merchants. 222. On the 5th His Highness heared that some fighting had taken place at Khaburah among the Hawasinah and 40 men had been killed. The ' Nur-ul- Bahr ' was at once despatched to Khaburah at night returning to Maskat the following day. Vide diary entry 188. C31FD—44—28 6.I3—GCBP SimlaFeom S ir, No. (y 4 A of 1913.

She left again in the night for Sib with the Wall and the men on board whence they will proceed to Samail to join Saiyid Nadir. 242. On the 15th about 20 men of the Bani TJmar arrived from Sur, it is said, to guard the palace. 243 With reference to diary entry No. 231, it is said the Imam induced the Wali of Sur to go back to Samail and bring Saiyid Nadir. No sooner had the Wali left Ziki than all roads were closed against his return and the Wali of Ziki Sand bin Hamed, being helpless, gave up the fort to the enemy. The news of the fall of Ziki reached Maskat on the 20th and was conveyed to the Political Agent by His Highness in writing. 244 On the 17th, the &lt;e Nur-ul-Bahr ' left for Khasab to collect more men and returned to Maskat on the 21st with about 100 men. They have been landed in Maskat, it is reported to garrison Maskat. 245 On the 19th, the Wali of Sohar arrived to confer with His Highness and returned to Sohar by His Highness's steam cutter the following day.11 246. Saiyid Nadir is said to be still ai Samail. It is said that he fears to advance against the enemy, as his troops are unreliable and favour the Imam. 247. With reference to diary entry No. 220, it is said that a large number of arms and ammunition belonging to Maskat arms-dealers were found in Nizwah fort. This has strengthened the enemy considerably.

I have just time for a short note—as the mail is sighted—to give you th© latest news of the Imam's rising. This morning I asked the Sultan for an interview, but he could not promise me one, as he was expecting Saiyid Taimur on his way back from the Sur where he has gone in the ' Nur-ul-Bahr ' to fetch a contingent of the Jaalan men. The Saiyid heard that a steamer was seen coming up from the Sur direction. It was really a big steamer from Aden but, on seeing the smoke, it was reported to him that Saiyid Taimur was returning. When he found out his mistake, he called at Matrah to pick up a messenger from Saiyid Nadir and came back direct to the Consulate, where be had a long confab with me. He handed over three letters of which I enclose the translations to show you the sort of rubbish that is flying about. The position is as follows ;—• Saiyid Nadir is in Ismail and Taimur is expected anytime with the Jaalan contingent, of whom some may stay here and the rest will move up, possibly with Taimur himself, to Bidbid, whence the relief party for Awabi is to start. Saiyid Faisal tells me that he fenrs Awabi too will fall, as it is only held by some 15 men of Hadhramaut. The relief party should have started long ago, but they are treacherous and causing interminable delays to Saiyid Hamad, who is in command. I made a suggestion to the Saiyid that, if he liked, I would ask the Senior Naval Officer if it would be possible to transfer the &lt;{ Odin , ' and the two launches on the Mekran coast to the Batineh coast. He replied that if I was alarmed for the safety of my nationals there would be no objection, but he saw no necessity for it. I replied what I wanted to do was to act in concert with him throughout. I asked him what the chances were of a sudden raid on Maskat or Matrah and he said that it was practically impos sible. I asked how much warning we should have of an attack and suggested seven days. He said, he would have more than that. Of course British sub jects are greatly alarmed, but I hope • Major Murphy is leaving by this mail^ ^ aDd tMnk HighneSS Well knOWS what he is about. I wonder if Murphy* is very busy up there with you in Bushire. If not, I think it would be no bad thing to have him down here for a week or two. It might be useful to have a staff officer here in case there was any question of sending troops here, as it is just as well to be prepared even for the most unlikely contingencies. JJere is the mail just anchored, so I ipust stop, Sub-Enclosure No. 1 to Enclostjee No. 5, {Confidential.) Translation of a letter from Isa bin Sal eh al Harithi to Shaikh Rashid bin A?ayiz bin Bakhayyat al Khasaibi, dated the 12th Rajab 1331 Hijra {18th June 1913). After compliments. —We are well and thanks be to God in good health I May you never cease to be likewise and here is no news but good news and praise be to God alone. And we had arranged the 15th of the present month as a fortunate day for proceeding to the presence of the Imam, after letters and messengers had constantly come inviting us to go to him. A,nd we di^ UPt gee any escape from answering to one who calls in God's name and havQ12 »iade preparation to go to him with the blessing of God and to help him* And a letter has already gone from us to you and no reply came. So we followed it on with this letter. And see ! Oh Aba Eashid («.&lt;?., wise old man) this wonderful strange affair, how the Shaikhs of Thahirah and the Shaikhs of Oman are serving this Imam without hope of gain and the grace is to God and the forts are calling out ' Come ! Come ! ' . And this is due to the wonderful works which they have witnessed and there is to God a hidden secret among His worshippers—a man of the ordinary people knowing nothing but piety and him the cities of the East and West serve I There is no God but God \ Oh our God ! No one can raise whom Thou hast put down, nor can any put down whom Thou hast put up ! And when the great God has made the people obedient to a fortunate onCj then they too are fortunate. May God disappoint the Christians I May their conspiracy be dispersed and their knavish devices returned into their throats ! For certainly they were the cause of a cleavage between the King and his subjects. And first and last the event is with God and we are what we formally were and greeting ! Written at his dictation by his servant S'aud bin Hamaid with his own hand on the 15th Eajab 1531 Hijra. P. S. —Your letter written on the last day of Jamadi ath Thani has reached me after the writing of the letter and I have understood it. And what was feared about the people has been dispelled {i.e., that they would not follow the Imam) and opinions are changed and this is because of the wonderful works they have seen. And your not replying when Eashid returned is not due to the cause you mention but because of the angry eye {i.e., of the Sultan) and do not forget Ibn Arfah and his affair, and we are ias we were and God sees all and greeting. Isa wrote with his own hand. Sub-Enclosure No. 2 to Enclosuee No. 5.

After compliments. —I arrived in Izki to-day a little before noon accom panying the Imam of Muslims. May God help him ! And I heard about your honour, that you are staying in Samail. And we are indebted to you lor kindness which we do not forget, had it not been what the Shara* makes it incumbent on us—obedience to religion. But we are the first of those who joined as a deputation (body). And it only remained to fulfil the (duty of) 'advice to you as a matter of consideration or regard. So, when this my letter reaches you, look out for yourself a way to get out from there; because all who are around you are against you. Eeally they are beguiling you to take jour money from you. Escape ! again, escape ! And I swear before God that this is the clear outspoken advice and I am sincere, although you may think that I am a fighting foe. So, whoever persuades you other than this, is deceiv ing you. And I do not add more warning to you and salaam. (Signature and date.)

We were given to understand last night that a letter had been sent for us some days since and nobody was bold enough to bring it to us.

After compliments.— HhQve is nothing in this your country that would necessitate communication except the arrival of a messenger from the Imam, and before this other messengers came insisting on our going to him. i^ast ni^ht I read his letter and therein he pressed me, and God says Listen to the inviter of God'! So we have determined to obey him, like Muslims, so that we may be of those who are saved. And the intention is to go oa the 15th day of this our month with a handful of men. And this is the third letter and no reply came from you without any cause or reason. Your letters to the Shaikhs of the country were shown to us. But this is not the day (time) for them. So, do not turn your attention to them. But if you needs must do so and there is no alternative, then for an emergency of this ki nd» there are the 'Al-i-Tamam (the tribe of Bani Bu All). But I understand that they have sought the help of the 'Al-i-Shams (the tribe of Bam Bu Hasan) and ask that they may be left in their own religion (Sunm). And what has happened, 0 King, is a matter which is supernatural: the tribes from the east to the west of the country are drawn (to him) while the Imam is m Nizwah. And there was nothing except his real piety and the exhibition ot miracles which, we do not think, will lead to what you hear and see. God knows best where he sends his message. And we are as heretofore. It you have any orders or ask something of us, we will not excuse ourselves, please God, from what leads to the benefit of peace and in God is our trust and he is the best to trust.

Dated 6th July 1913. This morning I was appealed to for help in the defence of Masqat and Muttra by the Sultan of Masqat. The Shihuh tribe have fallen back on Sohar and the Bani-bu-Ali on whom he chiefly relied have retreated to Watiya. The Bidbid force is thus dispersed and with the exception of the Bani-bu-Ali at Watiya nothing further remains between Masqat and the insurgents. Any time within the next three days, therefore, Masqat may be attacked. Syad Nadir who is in command of a not very reliable garrison of 70 men holding the Samail Fort, has been com pletely surrounded by the rebels. Only with great difficulty therefore, will any news be obtainable. There can be little doubt that the Sfeolkh's present troubles have been caused to a great extent by the policy which we have urged him to pursue. He has throughout loyally acquiesced in our wishes and I hope it will be found possible to give him our full support. I recommend that 6rders should be issued to 'Philomel' and 'Odin' which are at Masqat now, and to 'Pelorus', which is expected to reach here this afternoon, to stand fast un til the situation assumes a more tranquil aspect.

With reference to telegram No.98 from Political Agent, Muscat. Exclusive of guards at private houses, Kharag Island, and Residency, the strength of the 2nd Rajputs at Bushire is 400 men roughly.^Not unnaturally considerable irritation has been caused by the recent action against the Tangistarns^Al though there is no doubt that it has had an excellent effectA At this Juncture, stationed in Bushire to^^ repeat the incursion they made into Bushire in 1909 with a force approximately 1000 strong. The Governor relies on the presence of our troops here to ensure tranquility, as he has no forces of his own. I doubt the desirability, therefore, under these cir cumstances, and after talking matters over with the Officer Commanding Troops, of despatching to Muscat more than 250 men from here. There will then remain at Bushire a force of 143 men and 3 maxim Guns, exclusive of guards. The guard at Kha rag Island could then be reduced to 20 men, add the remainder 50 men and 1 Maxim gun, could be brought across to re-inforce the troops left behind here. As soon as orders are received troops can embark and I will, in the meantime, do my best to delay the mail steamer^ departure. Birdwood,0 Telegram.

His Highness would, I am sure, immediately ask us to land the troops at Muttra and take necessary measures to protect both places. Unless, however, he understands the position nothing will be done by him until the Imam actually knocks at the gates. He would then irritably ask what our troops are supposed to be doing. The actual landing of troops would, in my opinion, immediately have a calming effect, and it is probable too that such action would of itself serve to relieve Saiyid Nadir ! s critical position, which is a cause of great anxiety to His Highness. I therefore strongly urge to be allowed to approach him on the subject. His Highness would also be required by me to fur nish a request in writing that he wishes our troops to be landed.

Subject to approval I propose to proceed on 'Phi lomel' and watch developments, and endeavour to get into communication with the rebel leaders with a view to ascer taining, on behalf of His Highness, what the prospects are of coming to an arrangement. I would be accompanied by the Sultan*s Secretary - Sheikh Rashid - and the latter probably.would be sent as an envoy under a flag of truce to discover the intentions of Isa-bin- s al©h, and ascertain the chances of arriving at an understanding with him. Without previously consulting both the Government of India and the Sultan, I would not commit either to accepting any agreement. The rebel leaders may, as seems likely, decline to be interviewed and should this occur and should I also see signs of the rebellion weakening, I will consult the Sul tan's Secretary and Hamid as to the advisability of des patching- the Bani-bu-Ali forthv/ith against Bid-bid, where Isa's force numbers some 140 men only, and the Sultan's : jfort appears to be holding out ^till. Sayld Nadir wrote to his father In a cheerful strain as recently as July 9th saying he had inflicted heavy lose on the besiegers and was holding out well# The immediate object of the despatch of the Bani-bu-Ali is to relieve him. I would be accompanied to Sib by Murphy and, without permission, we would not proceed beyond that village, and would return to 'Philomel' for the night.

In the same letter Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh complained of not e-etting anv reolv from His Highness to his letters. 257. On the 24th, the news of the fall of Awabi reached Maskat. It was said that His Highness's garrison there had deserted the headman leaving him helpless. 258. His Highness the Sultan interviewed the Political Agent on the 23rd and 26th in connection with the disturbances. 259. News reached Maskat on the 27th to the effect that Saiyid Taimur and his party were at Sib and were unable to proceed for want of trans port. 260. The ' Nur-ul-Bahr ' returned from Sib on the night of the 26th and proceeded to Sur to bring more fighting men. Enclosuke No. 2. Extract from Maskat News No. 27—638, for the week ending 5th July 1913, Condition of the country.— The ' Nur-ul-Bahr' returned from Sohar on the 30th June with Saiyid Taimur on board and left again for Sohar in the night with Saiyids Taimur and Ziyab to collect fighting men. She returned to Maskat being unsuccessful on the 4th with Saiyids Taimur and Ziyab. It is said that men from Sohar refused to partake in the fio-ht against the Imam. 0 a 267. With reference to diary entry No. 257, the headman Sherif, of the fort of Awabi, with 20 jpen, arrived in Maskat on the 2nd July.

His Highness is said to be much annoyed with Sherif, but has not yet punished him. 268. News reached Maskat on the 4th that the Imam and Shaikh Isa-bm- Saleh had reached Samail and fighting had commenced. It is said the ™ tribes— Hanawi and Ghafri—who were with Saiyid Nadir have now gone on the Imam 's side. Saiyid Nadir's force is said to be small. 269.

Faisal P ai 1 d ^f. ano ther visit this morning. He was very civil and said that he was much obliged for the prompt payment of the 30,000 rupees instalment. I replied that it was for us to be grateful to him for his steady support of our policy. His Highness came to see me on his return from the J^A 0 U' AT ^T 1110 . 11 re 3 turned this morning bringing Saiyid Timur, Muham mad bm Nasiral Alawi and 400 men of Jaalan and among them, His Hiehness r Bani ;Rasib ^ His Hi ^ness seemed very much elated by the arrival of the Jaalan men and said that now all the Ghafiri tribes would come over to his side. He also told me that there was some hitch about the forces of the Imam entering the Wadi Ismail; either the Bani Euwaha refused to allow the Bam Riyam to enter, or the Bani Eiyam themselves refused to enter, the Wadi Samail. ^ reives I think I have told you Awabi has fallen. His Highness told me that it was one ^arghuf of the Ayal Saad who was Instrumental in bringing about the surrender. The commander was bought out. Nasib told me that the commander was only interested in defending the money which he has amassed as a retailer of arms and that when that money was paid to him, he surrendered tJie tort. It appears tbat Saiyid Hammad is now in Nakhal and Saiyid Xadir in Samail whither Saiyid Timur will proceed with the Jaalan men, disembarking them at Sib or Burka. The 'Noor al Bahar' has now (noon) left for the Batina. ^ I hear Isa-bin-Saleh has reached Izki, but with only a small following, as he said in the letter which I sent on to you. I told Saiyid Paisal that I had asked for Murphy 'ex abundante cautela , so that he might look around and see what precautions it might be necessary to take in the event of strong measures being inevitable. His High ness approved and said that he saw no harm if one of the launches, in about ten days' time, ran up the Batina coast and back, touching at the ports en route, to reassure our nationals. He explained that he had carefully abstained from asking assistance so far, as he was anxious that a small affair should not grow into a big one, as it certainly would, if the English showed great activity. This seemed an eminently sensible view. If any more news of interest comes along by Monday, I will try and write to you again on the subject. So far the rising does not appear serious, though it is troublesome. Enclosure No. 2. Dated Maskat, the 30th June 1913 (Confidential). From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have little to add to my letter of the 26th June, though, this morning, I duly conveyed to His Highness the message of your telegram No. 1153, dated 28th June 1913. His Highness was rather busy, as the « Noor al Bahar ' had just come in with Saiyid Timur. The latter said that the Imam and AlIsa-bin-Saleh are still in Izki and that 600 men from Jaalan hare readied Bidbid, under the command of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, a nephew of the old Amir, who died lately. Shaikh Hammad is there too. Saiyid Nadir wanted these Jaalanies in Samail, but the Sultan will not let them go there, as he fears that the Imam's forces might wander round by the Wadi Aqq and he hopes that at Bidbid they will cover the coast roads and Matrah and Maskat effectively. I have also had some letters read over to me from Saiyid Nadir and others. On the 22nd of Eajib (27th of June), Saiyid Nadir writes 44 When Isa-bin- Saleh came to Izki, Abdullah-bin-Said A1 Khalili (Hinawiyah Shaikh of A1 Alaiyah and of the Bani Ruwaha) and the people of Wahiba (also Hinawiyah) consulted among themselves and the matter was difficult for them and they knew that if the (rebel) army reached (Samail), they might be fought against by the fort (in which is Saiyid Nadir) and they wanted to consult them (the Imam, Isa, &amp;c.) and see what their intention might be. Then the Sultan (bin Mansur, Shaikh of the A1 Wahiba) desired to go to them and asked ^ leave of us for this purpose and we gave him leave.' (iV.i?.—This man's father, Shaikh Said-bin-Khalfan A1 Khalili, chief adviser of the Imam Azzan, was killed by Saiyid Turki. A letter from Shaikh-bin-Salam of the Shaikhs of Samail, written on 21st Rajib to Shaikh Rashid-bin-Azayaz, says—'And as for the Shaikh Khalili and the A1 Wahiba, they have advised the Imam to pass by Jay la and not to come by A1 Alayah. Wadi Jayla is full of Bani Jabir of the Ghafiri.' The letter goes on to say that all these people, including the inhabitants of Samail, are all traitors. I have also seen a letter from Ali-bin-Abdullah-bin-Said al Khalili to Saiyid Nadir in which, after excusing himself for the surrender of Izki (which was mainly due to his Ali's treachery), he says that he met Isa-bin^Saleh at Izki with 30 men and the latter was ready to mediate, hut the Imam and Shaikh As Salimi refused to listen to any talk of peace and told him to desist from such efforts. By the general attitude of those about me and Saiyid Faisal's demeanour, I gather that reports from the front are reassuring and that at least there is no immediate danger of an attack on Matrah or Maskat or on the coast ports. By the way, my policeman tells me that Ali Khan lost a fine big consignment of rifles and ammunition which the Imam confiscated when Nizwa fell, It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. Enclosure No, 3, No, 99, dated the 7th July 1913. From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I enclose herewith a heap of correspondence from the Imam and certain of his followers addressed to His Highness the Sultan, his sons and adherents. It is interesting merely as showing the character of the rising and the way the Imam is usurping authority. I have hardly time to comment on it and your knowledge of Oman and its people will no doubt enable you to identify the writers as well, if not better than, I can. I will now proceed to give the narrative of the last three days as well as I can. The news of one day will, as is only natural, conflict with that of the next and the more recent is the more reliable. On the 4th of July, the Prench Consul came to see me after his cere monial visit to the American Consul. Though he put his visit down to a mere casual call, there was no doubt that he wanted to learn our attitude in the event of the Imam's rebellion succeeding, and it was clear that he expected our intervention. He spoke long on the folly of these Arabs, asked what better kind of a ruler they could hope for, as he never took anything from them in the way of tribute, but, on the contrary,distributed money to them periodically and never oppressed them. He alluded to the bombardment of Zanzibar, at which he was present, and told how, up to the very evening of the bombardment, he could not get the Arabs to realise that a bombardment would take place. He said that he had been told that the Imam had given out that he was going to Bombay and that to his inform ant he replied that it was probably true, but that it would be under a corporal s escort with a fettered Imam. It was from the French Consul too that I learnt that the Imam had been collecting zikat and pulling up tobacco plants, &amp;c., which had made him unpopular. Talking this over with the Sultan later, I was informed that he had not heard much of this but, if it was true that the Imam had been collecting zikat, he was delighted to hear it. i.\ weil t to the Sultan to gather news and he told me the following ;— 4- Q H ama 4^ in - Abdullah » Shaikh As Sharkiyin, inhabitant of Fujairah, came to bohar with 500 men and wanted to garrison Sohar. When it was suggested to him that he should go up to the front, he withdrew to his own country. - '^' le reason that the Bani-bu-Ali cannot send more help to the Sultan is that they fear the intrigues of one Said. Said-bin-Saleh As Sanaidi ot the Smada section of the Bani-bu-Ali is friendly to their rivals, the Bam-bu-Hassan. 5 . T im ur arrived yesterday in the « Noor al Bahar ' from Sohar, which is juiet. Hammad is still in Burka, Muhammad-bin-Nasir Al Alawi and Muhammad-bm-Badar-bin-Saif in Bidbid, and Nadir in Samail. It was on this day in the forenoon, when I was very busy, that I was surprised by a visit from Monsieur A. B. Menasche who came to see me as Agent for the Field Rifle Company, Messrs. Laubenburg, &amp; Co. I had been told that morning^ by His Highness that Menasche had made overtures of some kind to Saiyid Kasim with a view of ascertaining whether it would be possible to obtain permission to reship those goods for Europe. He said the same thing to rne and I thought there was no point in bandying words with him as to his late apparently unscrupulous conduct. He also told me that his principals had informed him that they had learnt that certain concessions might be arranged for them and he would be glad to learn the nature of those concessions. I replied that I was not in a position to say exactly what the nature of those concessions might be off hand, but that an indispensable preliminary would be submission to the warehouse, at least to the extent of formally claiming the arms. He said that it would be impossible for his principals to get rid of the. arms by retail sale. I said that I thought he exaggerated the difficulty and that, if his principals submitted to the warehouse, I could probably arrange for a wholesale riddance of their stock. I then got rid of him, as I was thronged with work. On the 6th of July, while Captain Ballard, E. N., of the ' Philomel' and I were inspecting the new coal jetty which I was taking over from the Public 'Works Department, we were rather surprised to see His Highness row up alone to the jetty to meet us there in a small helium, rowed by three boatmen only. He came and gave me the news that resulted in my telegram No. 98 of 6th July 1913, and I made it clear to him that he was definitely askin^ for our intervention and that I should ask for troops to be landed at Matrah. 0 He fully concurred and, of his own accord, turned round to Captain Ballard, as he left, and said that he would be detained here at Maskat longer than he expected. His Highness seemed greatly cast down by the retreat of the Bani-bu-Ali. The Bani-bu-Ali were brought back by His Highness from Watiya, as my telegram No. 98 was being despatched. They are at present billeted in and around the mosque that Nasib built. I have warned their Shaikh, Muhammad-bin-Nasir Al Alawi, against looting, and he assured me that he would look after his men. I have so far received no serious complaints of their conduct, though, of course, their evil reputation is notorious and British subjects are depositing their valuables in the Consulate for safe custody. His Highness has, by beat of drum, warned all inhabitants of the suburbs that it is unsafe to stay outside the walls at night.4 Murphy has been studying tlie locality and the question of supplies. He has heen the round of the suburbs of Matrah, Darsait, Watiya, E-awi, &amp;c., under the charge of the Naib Wali of Matrah, whom he praises as one of the most intelligent and well-informed guides he has ever met. He has been extremely well received everywhere, has got all the information that he needed and far more than he expected. He tells me that he has made an exhaustive examination of Matrah itself and its capabilities. The Sultan placed his launch at his disposal one morning. On the 7th July, while I was interviewing the Sultan, Hill, Ballard and Murphy made the round of Maskat and came to the conclusion that they could easily hold Maskat town itself from the walls with 100 men from the ships and four maxims. If troops are landed from Bushire or elsewhere. Murphy thinks that the strategical point is Rawi, which would enable us to screen both Maskat and Matrah and get our people out of the town's confusion. This last is the latest news that I gleaned from His Highness this morning. Saiyid Hammad-bin-Paisal returned to 'Watiya at the Asr yesterday. At Bidbid, there is still a small garrison of 12 Hadhramies under the sons of Salim- bin-Said, A1 Akbari. They really ought to be 30 men, but as usual the Akid draws the money for 30 and keeps up only a dozen. These men had a brush with the Bani Jabir, who, on hearing of the departure of the Bani-bu-AIi and the Shihuh, tried to take the fort, but were driven back with the supposed loss of four men. In the Wadi Aqq is a miscellaneous company of Suris, drawing pay for 70 men, but probably only 40. At Samail, there have been a few casualties on the side of the enemy, especially at the house of Shaikh E/ashid-bin-Azaiyaz and the bazaar, which Nadir has been cannonading. Possibly 12 men killed and wounded on the night of the Imam's arrival. The 'Noor al Bahar ' has gone to Sur to try and get more men. The Commander's orders are if they cannot get them, the il Noor al Bahar ' should bring away the garrison. His Highness explained to me that the object of this rather singular order was that the Suris are so afraid of the Bani-bu-Hassan that, if they heard that, otherwise, Sur would be denuded of its garrison, they would be induced to send along a sufficient contingent.

From - Politioal Agent, Masqat. To - Resident, Bushire. Repeated Foreign, Simla. No. 105. Dated &lt;3: received 13th July 1913. With reference to my telegram No.104, dated July 11th, and in continuation thereof. Yesterday morning I had a lengthy interview with Shaikh Rashid, the Saltan and Saiyid Mohammed. The Bani-bu-Ali are not willing to move, and although it may be possible to induce them to advance as far as Sib, unless the state of affairs proves to be very favourable, which is unlikely, they will not advance any further than that point. If Bid- bid and Samail fall (and it is not expected that the latter can hold out longer than a month) all three individuals were unanimous in the conviction that we should then be faced with a rising of formidable proportions. Matrah and Masqat are at present quite safe and the three gave it as their opi nion that the rebels would finally disperse if a determined force was to be despatched to advance on Samail. The Sultan unfortunately appears to have no reliable troops at his com mand, but he says that if a British force was to be landed at Sib, ready to advance on Samail if necessary, the way would be cleared for him and his adherents to occupy Samail, which action would result in the gradual dispersion of the rebel confederates and the return to their allegiance of the Ghafiris. This appears to me to be the only alternative to an interminable occupation of Matrah and Masqat, though I am fully alive to the many objections which such a movement offers. I submit the proposal therefore as affording a pos sible means of returning to the status quo ante, and also as the adoption of it may in the long run result in the saving of time and expense.It, of course, goes without saying that His Highness would be ready to give us a written request: for such a move ment, it is estimated that, in addition to the troops al ready here, 2 sections of Mountain Artillery, and 1 battalion of Native Infantry would be required. Knox # /ZCTelegram. P. From - Resident, Bushire, To - Foreign, Simla. Kepeated Political Agent, Masqat. Ko.lk&gt;57. Dated 13th July 1913, to Please refer/telegram Wo.105 from Political Agent Masqat. We are in honour bound to give the Sultan and his sons our staunch support, having regard to the fact that the formop^ co-operation with us in the suppression of the arms traffic is partially, if not entirely, the cause of the present rebellion. Vigorous action now on our part will, as P.A. observes, probably save us considerable expense and trouble in a short time to come. The reality and critical nature of the Sultan^ position being unquestionable, we should not experience any difficulty in persuading the French Govern ment to recognize the fact and approve of any action we may have to take. For the purposes of a base Sib is an excellent place possessing as it does many shady gardens. If we were to land a small force here, prepared, if ultimately necessary^ to advance on Samail, such necessity would probably never arise. If only required to keep open communications between the coast and the Sultan^ force, the force mentioned by Political Agent, Masqat would seem sufficient. If we were at Field to be called upon to advance on Samail 2 Regiments/Service strength should, in my opinion be sent. Of these, one would carry out the advance, in coiijunction with the 2 sec tions Mountain Battery, while the other would maintain the line of communications. Cox.Telegram. P.

Tiiia afternoon I was informed finally by the Sultan that the Bani-bu-Ali refuse to move. He is completely disillusioned as to his Masqat Arabs and he added BOme .very scathing remarks about them. Information has reached me from a reliable source of a casual observation made ,to the American Consul by my French colleague which 1 append. He is said to have remarked that 'the opportunity of a generation now offers itself to the British, if they are only wise enough to taxe advantage thereof' Ooming from a spectator possessing an almost life long experience of Arabs and an intimate knowledge of Oman affairs, the remark appears to me a very significant one.

Translation, Letter from Shaikh S'aud bin AH al Jabri to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, dated the 11th July 1913. After compliments,-—We have formerly sent letters to you and hope they have arrived. Then we inform you about these rebels, Bani Eiyam; we have approached them with reference to abstaining from fighting against the Fort and now the siege is slackening and the loop-holes are further away from the fort; and there are many wounded and dead among the enemy; and none of the friends of Saiyid Nadir have been injured except that the gunner was slightly wounded at the beginning of the affair. And we have informed you about Isa going off to besiege Bidbid at the request of the Haddariyin; and they have not approached it but have alighted in the date trees of the Maha- shilah. And to-day a messenger has arrived desiring the Bani Eawaha to send him 100 men. And the whole forces of the enemy are less than 2,000 men and they would not amount to that much, were it not for the people of Sayma and Muharram. And yesterday we addressed Himyar by the tongue of Muhammad and to-day we have met together and have addressed and have done our best to make him refrain. And he says—' I have given my promise and pledge and cannot break them, but it is better that the Shaikhs of the people of Sur should come and those of the Jaalanis who are with them and should address themselves to Isa and with them Shaikh Eashid; and that they should ask Isa to go between and that he should assist those who come. But the beginning of the questioning and of the conversation is with Isa-bin'-Saleh so that they may think that there is previous knowledge between us and them! And, if Shaikh Bashid and his party come, it is better that a peace be made for otherwise they are ready for battle and the enemies are not many, only two thousand. And now they are distributed between Bidbid and Samail and—irr-iii - r ^ M it is better that they should come prepared for either alternative (either war or peace), hut by the road of Sib and should get down in Sib about the evening time. And that they should be disembarked about 3 o'clock in the after noon and, immediately on disembarkation they should go forward, lest warning precede them. And evil is not rebutted except by evil like it. And the people of these parts on the arrival of someone from your direction and he in strength will profit you, but there is no profit in letters from a distance, while these people are besieged and no help is sent to them. And we anticipated all this trouble from the people of Samail and warned you about it; and now all the people of the Sifala are assisting the Imam in various ways and abuse your poor servant, and letters constantly come to me; sometimes they ask for cartridges and sometimes they demand that I should go with them and some times they demand my allegiance and sometimes they say that your messengers go through me to Saiyid ^Nadir. They do not leave a single arrow unshot from their quiver, but by God's grace nothing of all this enters my ears (i.e., I am not affected by them). And we hope from God that he turn their devices against them and, if they get the mastery, there are plenty of other places by sea and land for me to live in and the rest of the news by the tongue of your servant Ali bin Muhammad. JP./S. —Yes! and when the aforesaid arrive, let them bring with them special letters for the Bani Jabir and the Siyabiyin to come with all their Arabs. If you have got profit and peace, well; and if not, then you must fight. And the Bani Jabir and the people of Jayla and of Tau in spite of their past actions, perhaps they regret them ; bat the people of Hil and Saija and remainder of their tribes are ready for war. And the better opinion is with you, but conversation and peace-making are of no use without strength and he who looks at the present only does not see anything except the present. And there should also be a letter for them all Ad Dabiyin and Ar Rahbiyan and the Bani Jabir and As Siyabiyan to assist the peace-makers warning them against assisting the Imam, and you know best and this is my opinion, and please tear this letter up after you have read it.

Do not blame me for any trouble that comes from them. And the Shaikh Hamyar, we have informed him and asked of hitn that he should refrain from hostility and we were unable to prevail with him. He said ' that he had come to an agreement with the Imam and As Salimi and if the Jannabah Shaikhs wanted to make peace, let thein address Shaikh Isa first and he was in Bidbid besieging the fort there and with him about 200 men. And let Isa address the Imam and the Salimi. ' But I think that this sedition will not be allayed except by a similar opposition and, while wo are in this condition, nothing will be done. And the rebels are less than 2,000 men and none of the people of these parts fight on their side with determination except Sultan (Shaikh Ar Rahibin), and Hamaid (Shaikh An Is adabiyin or Shaikh of Wadi ai Aqq). And it is reported to me that they have returned from Shaikh Isa irom Bidbid to gather greater strength froia '-W'L W.-3 tkeir tribesmen. And let Saiyid Paisal look to his affairs and ye also. And good is in the womb of evil. And if these forts remain besieged and are not assisted, there is no doubt that they will fall into their hands. And tlr j - .

After compliments' —Your esteemd letter to us reached and we understood it. And you are thanked (or it is kind of you). What you mentioned we have known. And that you want us to desist from helping the Imam and all Islam. So, know, O! tribe, that we have not the power to stand up for this except with this just Imam. And all the people of Oman have arisen for his help. And you stated that you arrived at Maskat in answer to invitation of the Sultan and that you do not find an excuse from Maskat (can not manage without it) because it is your oath or vow. Then, know, O ! tribe, .that w« know him who compelled you. Pirst, in the case of the sixteen men whom he beheaded of your community to please the Christians. And four* men in the treasury of the Port of Nizwah. This is what we know has been quartered on you. And as to ourselves, it is not hidden to you, that our enmity (hostility) has been our aim for ten years, until God has facilitated it this year by the hek&gt; of this Imam. And my advice to you is that you should follow the Bight and give up the Wrong. And as to what you mentioned that we have an excuse (alternative) from this Government then, know, 0 ! tribe, how can we excuse ourselves when we have made the bai'at of (sworn allegiance to) this just Imam. God save us from going astray to Ealsehood 1 To-day messengers arrived here from Sharqiyyah to the effect that they all intend to fight against (attack) Ja'alan and that they want a commander from the Imam and they are ready. But I took pity on you and have delayed that until we acquaint you with it. So, if you accept my advice, manage your towns, you as well as the people of Ja'alan. Otherwise, there is no way (blame) on those who do good. And as for what you remarked regarding Maskat that it will come under the control of the Christians, then, if there were injury, you would be nearest thereto and suffer most therefrom. And we are, by Grace of God, in freedom from that. Usual ending.

After compliments. —Your esteemed letter reached me and I understood its meaning, iind you mentioned that the Sultan's invitation came to you and you accepted it, intervening for peace and that you warn the people of Oman from fighting against the Christians and of what has befallen the Turks. And it is known that that is a fearful matter and it is what which has excited the people of Oman to rise up. And as for what has befallen the Muslims at their hands in the inhabited directions (countries), for the free, death is better than life in that condition. And when the Ummah * These men were killed by the Wali of Nizwah, Saif-bin-Hammad, about seven years ago.'1 (community) departed from the guidance of Al-Koran and changed the usage of the Prophet, Muhammad, may peace and blessing of God be on him, and the ways of the good ancestors, then has this befallen the Turks and othersv So, we say that the intervention which you make has been made by us ere nowV but was rejected to us. But we do cot remit in our endeavours. The Muslim slave of the Sultan is more beloved to us than a mushrik (politheist). And when your letter reached, I was not present in Samail, so that I might know what there took place, and I do not know what Shaikh Hamyar answered you with, for he is the base (or foundation) of the government. (True) goodness is- that which is evidenced by enemies. May God put us on the right road and He is enough for us and the best caretaker. Usual ending. Written, with salaam, by Sulaiman bin Sanan with his own hand. S tjb -E nclostjre N o. 5. Translation of a letter, dated the Sth Shaban 1331 H. (13th July 1913), from Shaikh S'aud- bin-Ali, al Jabri, to the aidress of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. After compliments.—As regards my not sending a reply by your servant, Ali-bin-Muhammad An Nahdi, we informed you about our communicatioB with Hamyar-bin-Nasir and we could not persuade him except that he would go with the majority and finally he answered that, if the people of^ Ja'alan and Sur wish to intervene, they should first of all address Isa, for he is in Bidbid and that he (Hamyar) is with them as an ally. And, last night, Sultan and Hammad (Shaikhs of Al Wahiba), came and took away the people of Izki and the Bani Eawaha and the following of Isa to Bidbid. Now the total number of those at Bidbid is— The following of Isa ... The Bani Bawaha and their companions The people of Izki ... who went away last night with the aforesaid (Sultan and ^Hammad). The remainder are all in Samail. When they first attacked the fort, they were less than 2,000 men, and, of them, a large number have returned to their homes. Those remaining, God knows, are about 1,000 men who are in Samail and Bidbid. And, last night, it was reported that the expenses of the siege were to be met from the property of the ' mut'allamin ', as was done at Nizwa. (iV. B.—The meaning of ' mut'allamin ' is not clear, but I hazard the guess that it means the inhabitants of Samail, more especially the recent converts to the Imam's standard, who might be described as disciples of the new religion.) Oh! our master 1 if you have help for Saiyid Nadir, be speedy with it- Beware of delay ! this is no time for delay. And the people of Ja'alan and Sur had best come forward for two reasons, either that the money for expenses may not be got ready or * * * And the people of Wadi Samail (May God reward them !) now blame themselves for advancing on your town and against the Saiyid (Nadir). And if any one eomes oq your behalf, they will be with him and do not accept the opinion of whoever advises you to the contrary. Por God's sake, do not let the money for expense be got ready. Usual ending. Enclosure No. 2. Demi-official letter from the Political Agent, Maskat, to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, dated the 14th July 1913. This letter has only just come in in time to catch the mail, which it would not have done, had she not been very late. This is the first sign of weakening and the Sultan is correspondingly elated. Myself, I think it does not am mnt to much except that the Ghafiri are beginning to find that an Imam is an expensive luxury. It should not, I think, affect the policy, advocated by us in telegrams ending with your No. 1257, dated the 13th July 1913, but it s trongly supports the view that the rising will collapse, when our troops land at Sib, and that a further advance will not be called for. I do not knowI '■n ® 17 5 ^ where the Sultan will find the men to advance alone, as in addition to the Bani-bu-Ali declining to move, 1 hear that they are melting away and each fresh call on their services means fresh departures to their homes.

An advance on Semail , with the Sultan's consent, would, I am inclined to think, terminate the rebellion , and WM. no extensive operations would subsequently be necessit- -ated inland. I took the Sultan into my confidence on th© morning of the 17th. to the extent of tellin# him that we were carefully considering the question of the despatch of a force to land at Sib , together with the possibility of an advance on Semail . H.H. assured me that their co-operat- -ion would be welcomed by him. From reports I learn that the country lying between Sib and Bid-Bid consists of a fairly open plain \ and beyond that more plain and subsequently an advance would be up a valley which is not less than f mile wide in any part. A large proportion of the enemy are armed with rifles of a modern patter^and they would be able to command a moderated supply of ammunition. Their strength is estimated at 2000 by H.H.y The Sultan^ brother,however^ who was res- -ponsible for the highest estimate given me, said that their religous fanaticsm being aroused, 10,000 men might be the maximum number# they could produce.

T^o. 1294. Dated 19th July 1913. (1 p.l.). With reference to your telegram No.250-S. The position, as I understand it, is that the military au thorities do not regard with approval the idea of sending a regiment to Sib to encourage the adherents of the Sultan to advance and to ensure a safe base for them to fall back upon in the event of failure, and that if troops are despatched from India at all, a force of sufficient strength to relieve or recapture Scwnail independent of the Sultan*s troops should be sent. Be that as it may, the despatch of troops is, in my opinion now urgently indicated, and if' Knox reports no change in the situation, in the telegram he has promised to despatch from Sib, I consider that the troops should be sent without further delay. If Sajyid Nadir can continue to hold out till the arrival of our troops at Sib, my belief is that, as soon as the news of their landing reaches the insurgent forces, the latter will evaporate, and that at any rate we would be able to relieve Bayid Nadir with very little difficulty. A But should Samail fall before the arrival of our troops at Sib, the rebels would probably derive considerable en couragement from their success and the recapture of the it position would become a more difficult matter; but^would, I consider, be absolutely necessary, as the possession of Samail and the control of its two main channels of commu nication with Mairah^is an essential factor for the preser vation of the commercial existence and the security of Masqat Further active rebellion would, I am confident, cease onon the relief or recovery of Samail, but the restoration of Nizwah and the other important points recently captured by the rebels would not necessarily follow. On recovery of Samail, the security of Masqat thus being assured, we should then have deliberately to consider the whole question of the future of Oman under the Sultan's rule. This would of course be a big question, and beyond the recovery of Samail and possibly the holding of it for a short time subsequently, I do do not consider that any further action should como within the scope of the operations now contem plated by us.

With reference to diary entry No. 269, the ' Nur-ul-Bahr ' returned from Sur with about 300 Jannabah Bedouins and landed them at Matrah for the protection of that town. 282. On the 6th great excitement prevailed in the town of Maskat. News was received that Saiyid Nadir was surrounded by the enemy on all sides and was fighting with them with only about 80 men, the rest having deserted him. The Bani bu Ali who were at Bidbid, vide diary entry No. 259°, being unable to proceed to the scene of troubles were brought to Maskat in tow of the Sultan's steam cutter by Saiyid Taimur, it is said, much against his wish. These Bedouins on arrival got scattered all over the town of Maskat thus increasing excitement and fear of the populace. Merchants packed up their goods, secured and closed up their shops for fear of loot. His Highness beat drum calling in all people living outside the gates of the town and asking those who possessed no weapons to come and receive same at the palace. Towards the evening of the same day the Agency peon was sent round to inform British Indian subjects warning them to bring their valuables at the Agency for safe custody and by 5 p.m . large sums of money and other valuables were received for deposit. 283. His Highness has himself packed up his own valuables to move to the fort in case of necessity. 284. On the 7th, Saiyid Hamed returned from Nakhal. 285. On the 8th, news was received in Maskat that Shaikh Isa bin Saleh had reached Bidbid and was fighting with the Sultan's garrison there. 286. H. M. S. ' Odin ' moved to Matrah bay. 287. On the evening of 9th, S. S. ' Dwarka ' landed at Matrah 250 men of the 2nd Eajputs. Colonel Smith who is in command has taken up a strong position S. S. W. of Matrah and Maskat for the defence of these towns. Head-quarters are at Bait al Falaj and B-ooi is also occupied. 288. On the morning of the 10th, His Highness accompanied by the Political Agent proceeded to Matrah to confer with the Commanding Officer of the troops and returned the same morning. 289. On the same day a messenger arrived from Saiyid Nadir with a letter in which it was stated that Saiyid Nadir was well and had inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. H.M.S. ' Philomel' moved towards Darset. 290. On the 11th, it was reported that His Highness wished the Jannabah Bedouins who are now in Matrah to go to Saiyid Nadir's rescue. They assented half-heartedly, and about 30 of them left for Sur. They at the same time gave His Highness to understand they had not come to fight but to try and compose differences and had written letters to the heads of rebels to that effect. 291. It is interesting to note that on the 8th it was reported to His Highness that Muhammad-bin-Hamed, nephew of Shaikh Sa'id-bin-Nasir Al- Kindi had within the last few days loopholed a stone wall overlooking the AlW&amp;SSm mmm westerly tower of the Maskat town wall and the residential buildings of His Hi-hness the Sultan. Saiyid Taimur went and found the place as reported and had it pulled down. The man was well caned and dismissed. This is a characteristic trait of the Mutawwa (orthodox Abazi) party m Maskat who show themselves ready almost to assault any one who speaks against the so- called Imam. O iI ^ y Ko» of 1913.

Up to the present he remains confident that he v /ill be able to quell the rising hirnaelf, and at my first interviev/ he gave me a promise that Saiyid Nadir at Samail would be relieved by Taimur within eight days.- % Thaa proved correct to the extent that a messenger brought news to the Sultan on the morning of the 23rd that about 400 men under Saiyid Hamad had arrived^ at a village called Boa (?) , a couple of hours from Bidbid, and that a larger force consisting of $ Nairn and Jaalan men under Saiyid Taimur was ready to follow him. I pointed out to His Higimess as strongly as I dared that it was not fair to Government for him to run such a serious disk with adherents who had shown that they were disaffected aAd not willing to fight so often and so lately. I conveyed a warning to him that , in the event of the failure of this attempt , 4 Saiyid Nadir 1 s relief would be impossible^and reminded him that it would be a very different thing to recaptlire Samail than to relieve it as he was quite well aware. The Sultan , $ I think , sees the force of these arguments perf ectly , but cannot get away from what , I am only afraid , is overconfidence,and it appears that the only remaining course is to watch events and hope that they will justify the oUltan r s optimism. it seems unlikely the situation will ievelope rapidly now in any case , and , replying to a question of the S . jk .

You mentioned in it what you have mentioned. And you know that the ordering of Oman belongs to the 'Ulama thereof from old time and that every king, opposed to the 'Ulama, is deprived of the government, separated from the affair of the Moslems, has no enjoyment (share) in their government and his order has no validity. And as for Faisal, the 'Ulama have risen against him often times after his deprivation and deposition (from the Imamate). And he refused to resign and has kept his seat this long time past by the road of violence and wrath and the Moslems were displeased with his Sultanate and his acts. And you are a company of this Government. It is incumbent on you to refrain from the affairs of the Moslems, and it is necessary for you that you should not do us injury. And God will help us against whomsoever does us injury and God is his own sufficient Agent and his own sufficient Helper ! And our trust is in God and how excellent is the Agent! And whoever trusts on God, God will be his Befuge. Certainly God will bring about what He orders. God has appointed to everything a measure.

On the 14th, news reached Maskat that the enemy had strengthened their position at Bidbid. 302. The ' Nur~ul-Bahr' left for Sohar to hrin^ fighting men on the 14th and returned on the 16th with 250 men and the Wali of Sohar, MuzafFar. 303. On the, 15th, about 100 more men of the Bani Bu Ali arrived from Sur and joined their comrades in Maskat. 304. On the 14th, there was a fight among the Bedouins of the Bani Bu Ali outside the gate. Stones and sticks were freely used with the result that there were several heads broken. The quarrel arose over some pilfering in the bazaar by the Bedouins whom their Shaikh wished to punish. Even the Shaikh himself was stoned. The offenders were at last secured and confined in the fort. 305. The ' Nur-ul-Bahr ' left for Sib on the 17th with Saiyid flamed on board. 306. His Highness the Sultan has been getting letters from Ghaferi Shaikhs urging him to make an advance against the enemy and assuring him of their help but imploring him not to delay. The Wali of Sohar— vide entry 302, supra, is stationed at Wathaiya with his 250 men from various tribes. Saiyid Nadir's position was said to be very precarious on the 17th. 307. Hearing all sorts of discomforting reports of Saiyid Nadir's position, His Highness the Sultan himself left for Sib on the 18th, from whence he proposes to despatch an expeditionary force to Samail for the rescue of Saiyid Nadir. Before he left Maskat, His Highness told the Ghaferi Shaikhs, who are in M askat, and other people that, if they want him and if they are his well wishers, they should come to Sib and join the expedition. About 100 Bedouins from Matrah left for Sib to-day. 308. On the 19th, news from the interior reported Saiyid Nadir's position to be very critical; the enemy had mined the fort and was ready for blowing it up. On hearing this news Saiyid Taimur called on the Political Ao-ent, and having induced the Ghaferi Bedouins to follow him to Sib left by the steam-cutter in the evening and eight baclans containing about 600 men followed him. The Political Agent, accompanied by Major Murphy, Intelligence Officer, had preceded him in the morning on board the H. M. S.

The last news from Saiyid Hamad is reassuring. The third mine has failed as Sa|yid Nadir flooded it some- how and it fell in* The Bani are reported faith ful now and Hamad looks for an early advance and victory. Hamyar is supposed to be afraid of assassination and Isa bin Saleh is ma ring overtures to Saiyid Taimur. The bare possibility of an English advance up the 'adi Samail which has been discussed backwards and forwards in the bazaars, seems to have scared the life out of both sides. Please take all this subject to the probability of its being contradicted tomorrow, British subjects are now quite reassured and have begun taking back their valuables.

So I hastened to make ready to come, but a letter came to me from the valiant Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, stating that he had reached Hamim village and calling me to go to him with all Arabs bearing arms in order to oppose the enemy from the East. So I hastened to respond to his invitation and to gather my people together and to induce them to comply as a duty which they owe to you. And I could not leave them to come to you as they would not assemble for anyone except myself. I warned them not to lose (your favour) by any default of theirs at a time when armies are face to face, firing is going on and the flames of war are up on every side. And I thought it advisable to stay by them. And the country of your servants the Siyabiyin is guarded on all sides. And Nejd (a small tract in those parts) is empty; there are no Hinawiya there. We pray to God for good and for His Providence. And the enemies' host is engaged in their own affairs {i.e., are quarrelling among them selves). If you come by way of Nejd, no harm will come to you.

And we pray you to use extreme despatch in succouring Saiyid Nadir. We sent one to see the tunnel and he found that it was ready, wanting only a single day's work not more And how wonderful is all this delay on Your Highness's part while 'he tunnel is being worked up day and night. And this Government (the enemv) is not strong. If only 1,000 men were stationed in Safalah, they (the enemvi would not stand one hour! And the people of Safalah and the Bani Jabir wUl lean towards you as soon as you arrive. And now the most iniurious thinir of all is this tunnel which they did not find hard to work up in the least. And the fort is beleagured. And your servants have been continuously informin'' you of all this. Saiyid Nadir has had a shower of communications from the aggressors and has not answered them. But, our master! what is needed k someone on the opposite side (in face of the enemy). And the best tb.W would be for you to come forward immediately with succour. And Hamvar only watches when you should appear. The moment you reach Samail he would not stand an hour against right. But it all rests with you. Also trnuh t has arisen amongst Bani Brahim of Hel, and Muhammad Saiyid was S rA with a sword while standing in prayer and sustained three severe wounds And the assailant was his relation Ali bin Muhammed bin Saif.

He and his people are all well, by the grace of God. His reply will reach you. We thought it well to send your messenger back immediately. Then, as to the tunnel, it is ready. We sent trustworthy men and they found it ready and gone into the fort about 5 Ba'a (yards). And gunpowder has reached them from Nizwah about half a Bahar (20 Maskat maunds) in weight. They intended to fire it, but we went to As Salimi and Hamyar and asked them for delay until we informed you. To-night I sent your servant Saif bin Sallam to Thani and Mohsin. They are going to-morrow to ask for 3 days' delay. O ! our Master, we do not know why there is this delay on your part. If you do not lake steps to relieve your son, Saiyid Nadir, he is hard-pressed and without relief from you, most serious consequences will follow. And there is no need to leave troops in Maskat. It is best that they come up here, though it be only 300 men. We do not tell you to do anything except to send reinforcements or relief, and nothing but the goodness of God can be any avail. Salaam. Written with salaams by Saif bin Sallam with his hand. -p. S. —And as for Bani Jabir, do not suppose they are any good. Their condition or attitude is notorious.

Translation of a letter from Saiyid bin Ali bin Jabar to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, dated the 13th Shaban 1331 H. (18th July 1913). After compliments. —A letter has already gone to you by the hand of the man 'Ameri and 1 understand that he delayed in the village of Jay la. Then I informed you by another letter, by the hand of one of your servants, which I think reached you this morning. We have detailed all information for you. As regards news of Bidbid, Isa is besieging it, and those of the Bani Eawaha and the people of Iski who .are with him, are altogether about 250 men and not more. And those who are in Samail with As Salimi and the Imam and Hamyar, are 400, not more in any case. I sent out one to reconnoitre them in their camp and this is their force. We communicated with some of those in the towers, Bani Taubah and others who are with them gave them hopes and they relaxed in severity of firing. The booma (tower) tiiat was newly made by Salaiyim commanding (Shaikh) Bashid bin Uzaiz's house exposes the fort. And after we had secretly communicated with the aforesaid, the firing was relaxed by them except at intervals when their fellows remonstrated with them and they cannot give out what we have communicated, further, the greatest danger is the mine that they have made from Jalbat al Muallimin opposite the well, that is in the fort. Now it is said that it hasreached the base of the well tower. And we desired Hamyar to remain behind when his companions would go forward (not to join them) and we were unable to persuade him. And we gave him hopes (of reward), but he would not consent, without Samail and Bid bid. So now, know, our master ! we sent Mohsin and Thani (Shaikh of Bani Jabir) to the disloyal and if we iind any shame left in them, we will apply to Hamyar and As Salimi to delay the mine until we can inform you; and our object is that they may be delayed until your arrival. And you know, they are now making the best of their time and see no one to stop them. And they do not consent to anything at all. And we urge you to expedite your arrival and victory from God is before you. And the people of this direction will, in any case, be with you and in front of you. Please my master make haste! Make haste! And come, because the mine is ready. And if you delay, then you will be to blame and come forward with what troops you have. Their total number is as we have detailed already and not more, by God. And their force is daily decreasing, but our fear is on the score of the mine, which is ready; and yesterday they brought gunpowder from Nizwah. And a ba^ of saltpetre was obtained from Al Alayah. And as to the people of Sifalah, every one of them brings forward one thing or another. Everything cannot, possibly be put down on paper. We hope God will support you and grant you victory over your enemies, but make haste ! make haste! Nothing is before you at all. And the enemy at Bidbid will at once take to flight by Al Uqq and run away and the garrison and yourselves and the people of the town, who will join you, and those who might join you from the neighbourhood, all being against them for one thing or another,—will immediately make them turn round and fly away. But if you delay, the worst fears will be realized, of which there can be no idea. For God's sake 1 do not listen to any one advising you to delay even one hour. Eor God's sake ! Be pleased to pity (rccurringly) Saiyid Nadir ! and the mine is ready! Do not be deceived by doubt. For G-od's .sake! (4 times) and salaam. P. S. —The letter to Aulad Nasir was sent with your servant Hamad bin Ahmad Ar Euwaihi who will deliver it to them. We pray to the Almighty God providentially to facilitate the delivery of the letter. But delay will do no good. Make haste ! Make haste ! the mine is ready. If you delayed, you would blame yourself when blame will be of no avail. For God's sake 1 (4 times). Have pity ! Have pity 1 My master ! this is not the time for delay or remissness, on the other hand it is the hour for despatch ! For G-od's sake (3 times). There is no turning away (from evil) and no ability (to do good) except with (the help of) God, the High, the Great! We have asked Thani and Mohsin to come in order to confer with them. God is good ! (Wonderful) that when they arrived they turned towards the Imam and his following : like the sands they cannot be kneaded. This direc tion has not been spoilt or ruined except by these Shaikhs beings made as they are. They tore people away from one another and destroyed their unity. They are of no use, but evil is to be feared at their hands, finds.

We went to those insurgents some days ago and asked for a truce in order to see if we could join Your Highness, but we could not manage that. Now we hear that a mine is being laid, but do not know the truth of the matter. To-day, we went and conferred for suspension of hostilities for to-day up to sunset and this was consented to. Similarly we ask you to suspend fighting up to sunset to-day. And be pleased to send to us some of your friends whom you may like, to parley with us as to what is expedient.

We have despatched to him the requisite ammunition and money, and this (present assortment) will follow up. And the real state of things will be found in detail in the letters enclosed herewith. Ends. F.S. —As for the enemy, they are very much weakened. The second mine made by them since has fallen down on them and four men were killed. Please send us flour and sugar. Also kindly send us three guns with 1 50 rounds. F.F.S. —(In his own handwriting) My master! I told you what came to my mind, though my wisdom is doubted, namely, that no good can be expected10 from a people who take to their homes. Tour own wisdoili is a thousand times better. Now, what are your orders ? Brother Hamad and some of his men, have come hack without reaching the fort (of Bid bid) and those who turned back have not yet arrived here. This (neighbouring) jungle is being daily patrolled by our horsemen close up to where the routes go out to the interior of Oman, but none of the men has been seen. If possible, I, with my people, will make a surprise attack on Isa (bin Saleh Al Harithi). Jhnds. Enclosure No. 27. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Let any one who meets with this letter know that many people have cons tantly been asking the Imam of the Muslimin to abstain from fighting the Sultan Faisal bin Turki in Maskat and Matrah and they are flattering him (Faisal) in the hope tnat he will obtain what he demands, but he will not obtain abstention from the Imam except he grant conditions and among them are— (1) The agreement in the matter of arms between the Sultan and the Christians must be broken. (2) That the Wadi of Sam ail, Nakhal and Sur should belong to the Imam exclusively. (3) The reduction of customs duties in all the ports to the rates that were in force in the time of the Imam Azzan (May God pity him !). (4 j ) And that the Sultan and his sons should promote good and prohibit evil to the best of their ability. Now if the Sultan grants these conditions in full, we hope from the Imam that he will desist from fighting. And his brother Nasir bin Hashid wrote it 'with his own hand. Enclosure No. £8.

We also met the enemy coming down from Samail to Bidbid, and found that those (Siyabis and Jabiris) who had promised to help us had abstained, thinking that you had not more than tliis force of 200 men. They said we cannot assume hostilities as we are afraid that you (His Highness) have no more forces. So, we went to Jaylah and decided that we had best remain there seeing that the enemy was perplexed on hearing of the approach of the force (of Saiyid Hamad) and their force was much reduced. O ! our master ! we request you to expedite attack and not to allow any further delay. By the time we reach Jaylah the people of Samail had secured good positions. So, if you desire to possess Wadi Samail, then make haste to come to Bidbid with the remaining force. Send for us and we will meet you at Bidbid. For God's sake do not allow delay for we see that people (of Wadi Samail) are well disposed (towards you) and the enemy's cause weakening. Usual ending.

On arriving there, we divided our forces into two parts. One party consisted of the Bani Jabar and the other of your servant and his men of the west. And at the time of the fighting, we saw no one of the Bani Jabar who remained and we remained fighting with the Imam's forces from morning until midday and the loss on the Imam's side was seven men and our party did not suffer any loss by the grace of God. Then we returned from the fort and we and the Bani Jabir remained bickering.

From Hasqat. To Resident. Repeated Foreign. No 126. Dated and received 1.8.13. Today the Sul^tan sent rae a letter recounting briefly the danger to which the fall of Samail , which he says is near at hand, will expose British trade and his own rule , after which he points out that the warehouse and the rules framed by him on our advice are responsible for his troubles. This y he says, is clearly shown in the proclamation which the pretended Imam issued setting forth the conditions on which he will refrain from making an attack on Masqat and Matrah. The abrogation of the arms agreement between H.H. and the Christians is the first condition • The proclamation , which I have actually seen appears to be genuine. The letter goes on to say.,.. ' This arrangement has been falsely represented by interested people to be a device of yours and mine to prevent modern arras and cartridges from being obtained by the tribes so that they may be enslaved by us. 11 H .H. therefore confidently appeals to the British Govt to give him assistance and to show him their old and sincere friendship now that his hour of need has come, and asks that , at the disgretion of Govt , a force may be sent to relieve Samail or for ^ necessary so that the rebellion may be put down , and tHe country and trade enjoy peace again. Pending the receipt of Govt's reply he asks for a promise of secrecy. The Sultan is aware that the reply of Govt is uncertain. I will send comment and proposals later , and communicalje this now to save time. Knox.■ . TELEGRAM,P. From Masqat To Residant. Hepeated Foreign. No 127. Urgent. Dated 1.8.13. Received 8.8.13. With reference to my telegram No/ 126 dated Ist of August, I venture to request that the policy which was suggested in your telegram Mo 1294 dated 19th of July|hay be accepted in despite of telegram No 1323 dated July 27th from Foreign. The Sultan^ engagements with us have been kept perfectly loyally although recently the strain on his loyalty must have almost reached the limit. Prophecy is easy, but the warehouse arrangements are probably the first serious attempt in the reign of the present Sultan to enforce a necessarily unpopular policy on the tribes and the logical result of this might ha^e been foreseen to be the rising now in profrress. I submit with all Bespect that there will be a great increase in the diplomatic difficulties in coranection with the suppression of the Abms traffic should the warehouse arrangements be discontinued by the Sultan , which is the natural course for him to pursue if he despairs of our help. If however we afford the Sultan and the warehouse steady support we have in hire , after this trouble is ofeer, a devoted and strong ^friend , and a new era of peaceful development should dawn for Masqat politics. If the advance of the Iman^s forces turns out to be true , it would be a good thing for calls to bi made at Masqat by the transports to find out if an advanee should be made by the troops.

Condition of country.—• 317- On the 20th, news was received from Saiyid Nadir to the effect that his position was very critical; the enemy had mined the north corner of the fort and informed that they were ready to fire it and enquired if he wished to treat as to surrender and said that if so, he should do so at once. Saiyid Nadir, it is said, returned a reply saying he was prepared for the worst and that they could do what they pleased. A truce was, however, arranged by which hostilities were suspended for the time being. Saiyid Nadir, in a letter which he addressed to his father, asked for supply of stores, ammunition, spare springs for rifles, &amp;o., as his weapons were worn out. He advised Ins father to have no reliance in Bani Jabir as they had proved disloyal and faith less. 318. The same night Saiyid Taimur returned from Sib on board the Nur-ul-Bahr ' bringing news that His Highness had received news that the enemy were threatening Sib. The Political Agent, accompanied by Major Murphy, Intelligence Officer, left for Sib the same night on board H. M. S. ' Alert to confer with His Highness and support him, if necessary. Saiyid Taimur followed them in the morning on board the ' Nur-ul-Bahr '. He also took about 100 Shahu Bedouins who were in Maskat. Tbe Political Agent and Major Murphy returned to Maskat on the 23rd onboard the 'Alert'. 319. On the 22nd, news was received from Sur that an Askari of His Highness had been shot dead by a Jenaba. On hearing of the news about 20 men of the Bani Bu Ali left at once for Sur, but they were brought back for fear of creating difficulties in Sur. 320. H. M. S. ' Pelorus ' left for Sib at noon on the 22nd, returning to Maskat the next day. 321. News was received in Maskat on the 22nd that Shaikh Isa bin Saleh had reached Eanjah about ten miles from Sib. 322. With reference to diary entry No. 307, His Highness the Sultan returned from Sib on board the ' Nur-ul-Bahr' and came straight to the Agency and conferred with the Political Agent. 323. Major Murphy, Intelligence Officer, proceeded to Sohar early in the morning of the 25tb on board the ' Alert' returning to Maskat on the 26th. The ' Alert' was sent, at the instance of His Highness, to enquire for news at Sohar, reassure British subjects and at the same time as an intimation to the rebels that we were closely looking after British interests. On his return. Commander Wood, B.N., stated that he had found British subjects much alarmed, but they were greatly reassured by the visit. 324. With reference to diary entry No. 305, Saiyid Hamad had reached Bidbid. Eighting with the enemy had taken place. 325. His Highness the Sultan has received a number of letters from various Shaikhs entreating him to make an advance against the enemy and rescue his son Nadir who is in imminent danger. His Highness evidently has no confidence in them and, therefore, takes no notice of their promises to oppose the enemy.ssr— 1 Telegram - Chit.

With the instructions of your telegram No. 1323, dated 27th July 1913, before me, in which you quote verbatim Poreign Secret telegram No. 262 S., I was extremely reluctant to undertake this task but, in view of His Highness's present difficult position and the many disillusions as to the fidelity of his followers that he has recently experienced, I saw no other course open to me.

After compliments. —To-day my son Hamad and Wali Mozaffar arrived and with them some of the Shaikhs of the Bani Jabir returning from the Wadi Jayla and, as for the Shaikhs, your honour has seen them and has realised that there is no reliance to be placed on them; And likewise your honour is aware that my son Nadir is besieged in the fort of Samail with a lew members of my family and of my dependents and that they are all in great danger from the rebels; ( And then, if Samail and Bidbid fall—for this calamity is considered likely to happen—there remains no protection for the trade of your subjects, nay more, Maskat and Matrah will be in danger and never at rest; And all this sedition, as is plain from the notice which you have seen purporting to be from the pretended Imam, Salim bin Eashid al Kharusi, is owing to the establishment of the warehouse and to the rules which we have made on the advice of the glorious Imperial Government. Now interested persons have falsely represented this arrangement as a device on the part of you and me to forbid to the tribes of Oman modern weapons and ammunition, so that we may press upon them, seeking to reduce them to slavery. Now, in these circumstances, I hope from my old and sincere friends, the British Gov ernment, help in this time of need and I ask from you the despatch of troops, according as the glorious Government shall see fit, for raising the siege of the fort of Samail or its recapture, should necessity call for it, so that the rising may be quelled and peace be restored to my port and my country and to my merchants and yours from the machinations of interested persons and the troubling of the ignorant; and I shall keep the purport of this letter fully secret, until a reply reached me from the glorious British Government.

With reference to telegram No 284 S of.6th of August from foreign I do not think the despatch of reinforcements is of any use with the exception of 70 men from the depot asked for by the 0 0 Troops . There is certainly necessity for these to lighten the duties of the outposts and considering the approach of September and October, the unhealthy season of the year.The views held here are that there is sufficient force here at present to repel posiible attack. Until^f we raise the curtain it is difficult to say what is hidden behind it , but the tactics of Oman do not appear to lend themselves to an attack in strength /i&amp;pzC of a determined mature, and so there appears to be a A contradiction in terms between M effective aid confined to the coast' and ' crushing defeat'. It is probable that , in that case , the following will be the course of evehts; during the month of Ramzan they will be .inactive , and will mak® a demonstration ab-out the Id. There will be a few killed among the rebels and the remainder will retire. The pacification oft the country will not be attain- -ed , and we shall be committed permanently to defend Matrah and Masqat. There is however a strong argument in favour of the advance to Samail being postponed till Novemberin consideration of the climate.

Sub-Enclosure. (Confidential,) K J ■ ' EEPORT. Report on the history of the rising of the Imam of Tanuf brought forward to the 31st July 1913, The present lull in active operations seems to afford a good opportunity for presenting a history to date of the Imam's rising and for taking stock of the present situation of affairs. Causes of rising. 2. It now transpires that, practically ever since the establishment of the warehouse in September 1912, the principal Abbathi Shaikh, Abdullah bin Hamad as Salimi, has been quietly at work, sowing disaffection among the Omani tribesmen. His method has been to misrepresent the warehouse as a subtle device of the English, who had bought over the Sultan to their purposes, for depriving the Omani tribes of modem weapons, and especially of ammuni tion, so that^hey might reduce them to impotence and then ride rough shod over them. 3. It has also been suggested that a more recent cause, which may be compared to the match that set alight the combustible material carefully- prepared bv as Salimi, was the converting to his own uses by Saiyid Faisal of a portion, estimated at dollars 18,000, of the estate left by the lately deceased Kazi of Sohar, Muhammad bin Saif ar Rahaili. The late Kazi was, for this country, wealthy and respected and he died leaving a son his sole heir, Saiyid Faisal's action, though high-handed, was not, in the customs of the country, unusual but, probably on account of his personal unpopularity which seems unquestionable, gave great umbrage to the ' Mutawwab ' or religious party, who seem to have considered, though it is uncertain on what grounds, that the money should have been devoted to the support of the poorer brethren among them. The immoveable property is nominally in charge of the son. History of rising. 4. The first results of these machinations were the alarmist reports that reached Maskat in the third week of May 1913 that Shaikh A bduUah as Salimi had set up bis son-in-law, Salim bin Kasbid as 'Imam of the Muslimin It was alleged subsequently that Salim bm Rashid, styled al Kharusi, had to be appointed to this honourable position with threats of beingshot if he did not accept tlie'post. This Imam malgre lui Rad commenced sending letters, full of pious quotations from tlie Koran, to the principal Shaikhs, of the country side. In these letters he called upon them to rise : in defence of the Truth and to enjoin on all Muslimin the sacred duty of assist ing the cause even though it were only by their prayers. Nizwah and Rustaq were reported threatened. His Highness endeavoured too late to send reinforcements of arms and provisions to Nizwah and Izki, but the communications were in the hands of the rebels and the reinforcements never reached their destinations. Por instance, on the 3rd of June, news reached Maskat that His Highness' slave, Ambar, who was proceeding to ]Sizwah with 21 bags rice, 3,000 rounds ammunition and 100 dollars in cash was looted and murdered by the rebels and two more of his party were wounded. 5. But, before the news of this outrage reached us, Maskat was aware 9 on the 29th of May, that the Imam's forces were attacking Nizwah and, owing to the treachery of the inhabitants of the quarter called al Muddab, had established themselves in the town and were pressing hard the two forts and the mosque and the J3eyt Salit. On the 5th of June, the news of the fall of Nizwah reached Maskat. The Wali of Nizwah, Saiyid Saif bin Hamad, a member of the family of the Al bu Sa'id, committed suicide, fearing to fall into the hands of the rebels. It is stated that the Wali, some months ago, represented to His Highness the precarious nature of his position, but that the ' Khatibs or secretaries, who surround the Sultan insinuated that the Wali was striving to establish his own independence and His Highness took no notice of the appeal for assistance, made to him by his servant and relative. The Wali of Nizwah had held his post for about sixteen years. He came into his position by treacherously assassinating, somewhere about the year 1899, one Hillal bin Zahir, a local Shaikh of the Bani Hina, who then held Nizwah fort on his own account, setting at naught the authority of the Sultan. This Hillal had originally been established there by Saiyid Turki, father of the present Sultan; and he held the fort for some 12 to 14 years. Saif bin Hamad bin Saif bin Amir, the Wali who committed suicide, was a member of the ruling family, Al Bu Sa'id, and his father before him had held Nizwah fort, until he was turned out by the local Shaikh, Hillal bin Hamad of the Bani Hina, already alluded to. Harid bin Hammad, the brother of the Wali, has been imprisoned by the Imam at Nizwah. Pall of Izki and Awaibi. 6. On the night of the 4)th June His Highness, now thoroughly awake to the dangers that threatened him, took active steps to reassert his authority and seized some sympathisers of the Imam, who had come from Zanzibar, had bought arms from the French merchants at Maskat and were escaping to the Batineh coast. His Highness confiscated both their money and their arms to the value, it is said, of one lakh of dollars. Saiyids Nadir and Hamad, second and fourth sons of His Highness, were despatched, respectively, to Samail and Nakhal, the one to assist Izki, twenty miles from Nizwah, and the other Awaibi, an outpost of Bustaq. Both were seriously handicapped by the treachery and supineness of the Ghafiri tribes, supposed to be loyal to His Highness the Sultan. Not tha least serious effort was made to relieve Awaibi, which was, after a short resistance, surrendered by His Highness's Hadhrami 'akid : the news of its surrender reached Maskat 24ith of June. With regard to Izki, the position was little better; the family of al Khalili, of the Bani Kuwaha, Abdullah bin Sa'id al Khalili and his son Ali, endeavour ed to persuade Saiyid Nadir to proceed to Izki and to take with him from Port Samail the gun presented by the Trench Government to the Sultan of Maskat. Saiyid Nadir was ordered by his father to do nothing of the kind, and the Wali of Sur, Saiyid Hamud bin Hamad, was sent up with Ali bin abdullah al Khalili to assist his younger brother, Saiyid Sa'ud bin Hamad, Wali of Izki. Saiyid Hamud reached Izki without opposition, but Ali bin Abdullah al Khalili persuaded him to withdraw again to Samail and, in the meantime, let in the Imam's forces, when Saiyid Hamud could no longer return to the assistance of Saiyid Sa'ud who, finding himself outnumbered and deserted by his troops, surrendered the fort. Saiyid Sa'ud bin Hamad is now a prisoner in the hands of the Imam. The news of the fall of Izki reached Maskat oa the 20th of June.3 List of principal rebels. 7. It appears that the fall of Izki was the signal for Shaikh Isa bin Saleh al Harathi, the most active and enterprising of the Hinawiyah Shaikhs, whose name is already familiar from previous Omani risings, openly to espouse the cause of the Imam, whom he joined at Izki. Up till then, he had been sitting on the fence. Hitherto, the Imam's chief supporter from the tribes had been Shaikh Hamyarbin Nasiran Nabhani, of Tanuf village, the Tamimah. of the Bani Riyam {vide Persian Gulf Gazetteer, page 1594) and the four principal rebels from now onwards may be reckoned to be— Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, the Imam. Abdullah bin Hammad as Salimi, his principal spiritual adviser. Isa bin Saleh al Harathi of the Hinawiyah. Bamyar bin Nasir an Nabhani of the Ghafiri. Position on the 26th June. 8. Thus, on the 26th of June, the position was as follows ;— Nizwah, Izki and Awaibi were in the hands of the rebels. Saiyid Nadir was in Samail; Saiyid Hamad in Nakhal; and Saiyid Taimur, the heir- apparent, with a party of the Ja'alan men, the Bani bu Ali from Sur, was steaming up to Sib with the intention of proceeding to Bidbid, 21% miles inland from Sib and 15| miles from Samail fort. His Highness was much elated at the arrival of the Bani bu Ali, in whom he put great confidence. He was certain that with their arrival, the rising would fall to pieces and the Ghafiri Shaikhs return to their allegiance. The Bani bu Ali were under the command of Muhammad bin Nasir, a nephew of the late Amir of Ja'alan, Abdullah bin Salim al Alawi, who died early in this year. On the 80th of June, Saiyid Taimur returned and reported that the Bani bu Ali had established themselves at Bidbid and Saiyid Hamad had gone there too. Prospects of an early quelling of the rising were in sight, and it was hoped that Saiyid a adir would be relieved at no distant date. 9. On the 2nd of July, Major Murphy, of the Intelligence Department, arrived from Bushire to study the situation with a view to making arrange ments, should the necessity arise, of landing troops for the defence of Maskat and Matrah. He was introduced to His Highness the Sultan, who placed the Naib Wali of Matrah at M!ajor Murphy's disposal and every assistance possible was given to that officer by the local authorities, Retreat op Sultan's porces and arrival op British troops. 10. On the 6th of July, the hopes of paragraph 8 were rudely dispelled (1) by the fact of the Shihuh forces, assembled at Nakhal for the relief of Awaibi, falling back on Sohar, and (2) by the unexpected and unaccountable retreat of the Bani bu Ali from Bidbid to Wataiya, an outlying hamlet of Matrah. His Highness had them brought into Maskat for the defence of the town and thereby greatly added to the alarm and anxiety of the inhabitants, as the Bani bu Ali bear an evil reputation for looting and general misbehaviour. It must be added in their favour that, during their stay, no looting of any importance took place, but their counsels were divided, they quarrelled bitterly among themselves, they paid little attention to the authority of their nominal leader, Muhammad bin Nasir, and it was only with great difficulty that they could be persuaded to obey orders of any kind. At the same time, news came that the Imam had reached Samail, Saiyid Nadir was completely surrounded, and that Isa bin Saleh was attacking Bidbid. His Highness appealed to the Political Agent for assistance and he also wrote officially in the same sense to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (vide enclosure to Maskat endorsement. No. 101, dated 7th July 1913). By good fortune, His Majesty's ships ' Philomel' and ' Odin ' were in Maskat harbour, the ' Pelorus ' was on her way and the three ships received orders from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to stand fast till the situation cleared. \The Political Agent despatched a telegram No. 98, dated 6tli July K13, asking that the 2nd Eajputs from Bushire might be despatched to defend the two towns of Maskat and Matrah. 11. On the 9th of July, His Highness addressed the Political Agent in writing {vide accompaninent to Maskat endorsement No. 103, dated 9th July 1913) and asked that the Rajputs, who were expected that evening by the fast mail, should be landed for the defence of Maskat and Matrah. On their arrival that evening, they were duly landed at Matrah for the night. His Highness visited Colon el' Smith, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the next morning in company with the Political A^ent, and the Rajputs left the same day and occupied Beyt al Palaj, a hamlet south-west of Matrah; a picquet was posted on Ruwi village. Communication of the Political Agent to eebel Chieftains. 12. On the 11th of July, the Political Agent wrote to the four rebel Chieftains, already named above in. paragraph 7, reminding them of, and repeating to them' the warning of 1890hat the British Government, in view of the important interests of British subjects in the two towns of Maskat and Matrah, would not tolerate an attack by the Chiefs of Oman on these two places. The letters were delivered by a messenger, kindly supplied by His .Highness, to Shaikh Isa bin Saleh al Harathi at Bidbid. The Shaikh took the letters and returned the messenger without an answer. A reply was, however, eventually received, on the 21st of July, through the post from the Imam Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi. This reply was dated the 14th July and the method of its delivery proves what was indeed fully suspected before that the Imam has many friends and sympathisers in Maskat itself; it is polite, says that the Sultan has long been deposed by the 'Ulamah, but has refused to abdicate ; it warns the Political Agent to desist from troubling, or interfering in, the affairs of the Muslimin. It forms the enclosure to Maskat letter No. 118, dated 21st July 1913, to the address of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 13. The Political Agent, in obedience to directions from the Political Resident, on the 10th of July, took his French colleague into his confidence, informed him of the landing of British troops for the defence of Maskat and Matrah at His Highness's request. The intimation w r as well received and no hint was offered of any objection to our action. 14/ On the 13th July, the suggestion was put forward by the Political Agent and supported by the Political Resident that two battalions of Native Infantry of field service strength with two sections of a Mountain Battery should be despatched to Sib, ready to advance on Samail, if required. It was hoped that the landing of a strong British force would take the heart out of the rebels and the way would be opened for the Sultan's sympathisers to move into the Wadi Samail 'and quell the rising. In a further telegram, dated the 19th July, the Political Resident pointed out that the possession of Samail and of its two main communications with Matrah were essential for the commercial existence and security of Maskat and that, if Samail fell, its recapture would, though a more difficult task, be a necessity. Events at Sib. 15. On the 15th July, the Sultan himself left for Sib, arranging that he should be preceded there by a force of about 250 men under the command of Mozaffar bin Sulaiman bin Suwailim, Wali of Sohar, who had arrived as at Wataiya a few days previously. On the 19th of July, the Political Agent proceeded in H. M/S. 'Philome^ , , kindly placed at his disposal by the Senior Naval Officer, to Sib where he interviewed His Highness, asking him if he required more assistance. He found the Sultan in one of his confident moods and the latter said that he would inform him definitely, in three days' time, whether he required more help, adding that, if he did not ask in three days' time, he would not ask at all. His Highness was buoyed up in his hopes by letters received from various tribes round as Safalah, the lower portion of ihe Wadi Samail, urging him to send them a leader, when they would all rise• The S l Ultan asked the Poli « o al Agent to return that eyenins to B P v^ ympa 7 aDd frieDdshi P tha t existed between tn W h • f i H ^ representative were misunderstood and objected Snitch trOOP % and 11 t,,e ! mank 'P. countr y militated against the feultan s chances of quelling the rising himself. 16. On the 21st of July, the famous mine, of which much had been heard in vernacular letters to His Highness during the preceding weeks was fired with partia 1 success at the north corner of Samail fort, but Saiyid Nadir !r n ? lu , cklly hold[n S out aJ1 this tim e inflicting some loss on the little affe^^ a ^rh 1 p ^ a { 1 ^ e f nents ^ meet this disaster and his position was little aftected.

It was decided that in the event of urgent necessity, a Naval contingent should be landed to assist the Sultan m repelling the attack of the rebels and to ensure His Htehness's personal safety. j-t-igmiess s .n * 8 '. +?■ ^ ' 1 T ac , hed Sib at da . Tbreak on the 22nd and found all quiet there. His Highness had completely recovered his equanimity, was ^11 of schemes for reasserting his authority, had already despatched his son Hamad with Mozaffar s force on its way to Bidhid and went so far as to assure the Political Agent that.in eight days'time, Saiyid Taimur would open the gates 0 | . a 'f rr r ^ lieve brother Nadir. After the eyening interyiew of the 22nd, Saiyid Taimur, in a short hurried talk with the Politfcal Agent was certain that His Highness was oyer confident; he had no hopes of his own troops, still less of the Ghafiri inhabitants of as Safalah portion of the Samail yalley, on whom, in spite of frequent indications of treachery and disaffection Mis Highness continued to rely. 9 . 19 - A third interview took place on the morning of the 23rd. No satisfactory news had been received of Saiyid Hamad's advance, and Saivid Taimur had not yet started. At all three interviews, the Political Affent went, as far as he could venture, in urging His Highness to treat the British Government more fairly, warning him that, if the present attempt to relieve Samail failed, there would be no time to relieve Saiyid Nadir or Samail and that its recapture, with the whole country in a blaze of rebellion, would be a very different thing from its relief. He failed, however, to disturb the Sultan's optimism and returned to Maskat in H. M. S. ' Alert' the same day. Eettjrn op His Highness to Maskat. 20. On the 24ith. of July, His Highness returned to Maskat about mid day and, before even visiting his palace, came to see the Political Agent. He brought somewhat reassuring news of the movements of Saiyid Hamad, who had penetrated as far as Hamim and Parfarah with little opposition from the enemy, but Saiyid Hammad at the same time cited frequent instances of treachery and it was difficult to build any great hopes on this weak advance while it was clear that the Sultan's hopes of a Ghafiri rising in favour of his sons were not being realised. Saiyid Taimur was still at Sib, whither His Highness expressed his intention of returning. 21. On the evening of the i6th July, Shaikh Uashid bin Azzaiyiz, the Sultan's Secretary, brought further letters, from which it seemed clear that the Bani Jabir and the Siyabiyin tribes, who had been foremost in holdino- out promises of support to His Highness, were treacherous to the core and 0 only wanted money and ammunition and then refused to meet the enemy. Both6 Saiyids Hamad and Tainaur wrote to that effect. Shaikh Hashid further £ave instances of the bad faith of the Bani bu All and Jennebeh, who had sent the rice, given them for their progress inland, to their homes at Sur and had also left behind the ammunitions, with which the Sultan provided them, at Maskat for taking to their homes at the first convenient opportunity and then, on their arrival at Sib, were demanding extra supplies of both food and ammunition. A touch of pathos appears in a remark which Shaikh Kashid allowed to escape him, when he said that the Sultan, on learning the downfall of all the hopes that he had formed, asked his advisers whether they thought that, if he himself went up country, the tribes would still continue in their treachery. It is notorious that he and Saiyid Taimur are personally very unpopular and that the only one of the sons who would have had the slightest chance of stemming the rising flood of rebellion would have been Saiyid Nadir, who, it appeared at the time, could not, humanly speaking, be relieved. Terms offered by the Imam. 22. The letters-brought by Shaikh Eashid contained one enclosure, which appears sufficiently important to quote in full. It sets forth the terras on which the Imam undertakes to refrain from attacking Maskat and Matrah. ' In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate I ' Let anyone who meets with this letter know that many people have constantly been asking the Imam of the Muslimin to abstain trom fighting the Sultan, Msal bin Torki, in Maskat and Matrah and they are flattering him (Faisal) in the hope that he will obtain what he demands; but he will not obtain abstention from the Imam except he grant conditions and among them are— ' (1) The agreement in the matter of arms between the Sultan and the Christians must be broken. ' (2) That the Wadi of Samail, Nakhal and Sur should belong to the Imam exclusively. ' (3) The reduction of customs duties in all the ports to the rates that were in force in the time of the Imam Azzan. May God pity him ! ' (4) And that the Sultan and his sons should promote good and prohibit evil to the best of their ability. 'Now, if the Sultan grants these conditions in full, we hope from the Imam that he will desist from fighting. And his brother, Nasir bin Hashid, wrote it with his own hand.' Visit of H. M. S. 'Alert' to Sohar. 23. On the 24th of July, at the instance of His Highness the Sultan, H.M.S. 'Alert' left for Sohar to ascertain the state of affairs there and to reassure British subjects. Commander Wood, E.N., on his return, reported that he had lauded with Major Murphy, that British subjects were evidently alarmed by the prospect of Imam's coming and greatly reassured by the visit of a man-of-war, that the Arab Naib Wali and the Arab community, though friendly, were evidently much exercised as to what could be the object of the visit and, finally. Commander Wood came to the conclusion that the Arab community of Sohar had little confidence left in the Sultan and would be disposed rather to welcome the advent of the Imam. 24. It was not until the morning of the 27th, when the Political Agent had an interview with His Highness the Sultan that he was enabled to account for the unusual anxiety displayed by His Highness on behalf of British subjects at Sohar. It then transpired that His Highness desired to ascertain whether any news had been received of the arrival, or of the approach, of certain Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, on whom His Highness relied to act as inter mediaries between himself and the Imam. The Naib Wali of Sohur had written to His Highness that nothing had been heard of these people at Sohar. The Political Agent again asked the Sultan whether he had made up his mind finally to appeal to us for the suppression of the rising. He informed him7 confidentially that, although it seemed clear from telegraphic news that the Government of India were carefully considering the possibility of being appealed to for further assistance, it was quite impossible for them to proffer assistance unasked and that it was by no means sure what decision they would arrive at. His Highness asked for five more days to await the arrival of the Chiefs from Abu Dhabi and expressed disappointment at their delay and failure to keep their promises, though it is not easy to see what assistance they can render him. 25. Thus on the 27th of July, the outlook for His Highness seemed blank indeed. One would have imagined that it would have been only a question of time for him to find himself at the end of all these false hopes. His procrasti nation had apparently extinguished all hopes of a relief of Samail as the time for a rapid dash on the fort had passed. Its fall within the next fortnight was to be anticipated. The result would be to confine the Sultan's authority, even if only temporarily, to the enclave of Matrah and Maskat, when it would become a question whether British interests would not demand our interven tion for the restoration of order, whether that should be accomplished by— (1) arriving at some understanding with the rebellious tribes, assuming a protectorate over Maskat and Matrah and the environs, together with police rights up the Batineh littoral, leaving our relations with Sur and its hinter land much as at present, or (2) compelling the rebels to submit to their lawful sovereign. 26. But the situation is kaleidoscopic. On the 28th July, in quick succession to a despairing appeal to Saiyid Hamad from Saiyid Nadir, came reassuring news in a letter from Saiyid Hamad to His Highness; they pointed to the practical withdrawal from Samail fort of the rebels, the fears of Shaikh Hamyar for his own life, the return to their allegiance of the Bani Jabir and as Siyabiyin and finally to the prospect of an early advance and speedy victory. At the same time, Shaikh Isa bin Saleh wrote to Saiyid Taimur offering to negotiate with him. It is true that, up to the date of writing, 31st July, no news has been received of a realisation of these hopes, but neither have they been contradicted, nor has Samail fallen and the miraculous restoration of the Sultan's authority is within the bounds of possibility. The date trade is at a standstill and this must be a matter of as grave concern to the up country rebels as to the British exporters on the coast and it is probably on this chiefly that we must rely for a return to peaceful conditions. No doubt also the plans of the rebels have been upset by the prompt landing of the force of Native Infantry which has diminished their hopes of dictating terms to the Sultan in his own capital. 27. This report is intended to bring the history of the rising up to date and to try and reconcile the contradictory rumours that have marked its pro gress. To attempt at present any forecast of what our future attitude should be with regard to the Sultan and his relations with the tribes of Oman would appear premature. S. G.

THE Under-Secretary of State for India presents his compliments to the Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and forwards herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State, copy of enclosures in a letter from the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, dated the 19th June, 1913, relative to rebellion in Muscat.

IN case there may be any development of the movement, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, an extract from the last Muscat diary, dated 24th May, dealing with an embryo rising against the Sultan on the part of certain disaffected tribes of the Wadi Maawal and the Nazwah district. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Extract from Muscat Agency Diary for the week ending May 24, 1913. SEVERAL reports have been received by His Highness the Sultan during the week from Rustaq, Nazwah, and other places to the effect that what may prove to be a powerful rising is forming in those quarters under the ringleadership of the Chief Abadhi Sheikh, Abdulla-bin-Hamed-es-Salimi, who, himself an old and almost blind man, wishes to proclaim a religious war against the Sultan, with the object of setting up his son-in-law, Salim-bin-Rashid, as Imam of Oman, the cause being the supposed leaning of the Sultan to foreign Governments and institutions. This faction comprises the tribes of Bani Riyam Ibriyin and the Bani Hina tribes of Jabal-Riyam and Wadi-al-Maawal. The troubles originated at the village of Tanuf, near Nazwah, and it is supposed that the rebels might come down on Nazwah and Rustaq, as both of these places are said to be insufficiently garrisoned by His Highness the Sultan's askaris. . . . His Highness the Sultan seems perturbed at these manifestations, and is taking steps to strengthen his garrisons at Nazwah and Rustaq with men and provisions, but it is feared that he may be unable to do so, as it is believed that the communications are in the enemy's hands, v • i Letters received subsequently, and transmitted by His Highness to the political agent, show that the ringleader is already calling himself the Imam of the Moslems, and has been trying to persuade the chiefs of the Bani Ruwaha and other smaller neigh bouring tribes to join his cause.

With reference to your telegram dated 5th of August on the subject of Masqat , and telegrams recently sent by us in which reports on the Masqat situation received from Cox were repeated. Full recognition is accorded by us to the dangers which Cox and Knox point out that the Sultan may repudiate the warehouse arrangement and go back to the unfriendly obstruction which characterised his attitude in years past , and also to the further dangers that we shall be compelled to undertake the defence of ^asqat and Mafcoah for an indefinite period , and that fearing to incur consequences like those which havw befallen Masqat the other Arab ^^chiefs along the shores of the Persian Gulf will decline to assist in suppressing the traffic in arms. Moreover it is recognised by us that,in giving the Sultan the assistance which he r requires , not only will our moral obligation to accord him protection from the results of the helpful attitude which he has maintained towards us be fulfilled , but aleo much of the above dangers will be avoided and a further and practical demonstration be given of our special position in Masqat vis-a-vis other powers. Our former conviction ^ is neverthe less adhered to that there are greater dangers in intervention in the hinterland than are warranted by the ensuing advantages, and that our action should be restricted to the coast. The action taken should, however , be as wW ' !o c effective as may be permitted by the ciroumBtanoes• It is considered by our military advisers that the force which is now in Masqat and Matrah is only strong enough to hold its own in case of a serious attack, but that, a battalion of — ^ native infantry should be despatched to reinforce it and assistance rendered by field gund from H.M's ships to ena ble a serious a ttack to be repulsed with heavy loss to the rebels We concur in this opinion and propose that the despatch of a battalion of native infantry to Masqat should take place immediately if you approve.

From the enclosure in Sir P. Gox's letter No. 1762 of 1st June last, copy oi which was sent to your Department on the 8th instant, it appears that the rising is due to dislike of the Sultan's supposed leaning on foreign governments and institutions. In the circumstances, the Marquess of Crewe proposes, subject to Sir E. Grey's concurrence, to approve the recommendation by the Government of India that the warning authorised by Lord Salisbury in Sir T. H. Sanderson's letter of 22nd August 1895 should be renewed; and I am to enclose draft of a telegram instructing them accordingly. Sir E.

Three of His Majesty's ships are now at Maskat to which place two hundred and fifty men of the second Rajputs have also been despatched, but definite instructions have been issued that the men are not to be disembarked except for the actual defence of Maskat and Matrak, should such a step become necessary. At the same time a warning is to be issued to the leading Shaikhs of Oman to the effect that whatever differences they may have with their Sultan, the Government of India will not permit attacks on Maskat and Matrah. Your Excellency will observe that the warning is identical with that issued in 1895, the substance of which was forwarded to the Marquess of Dufferin in the Marquess of Salisbury's despatch No. 86 of 13th March 1896.

During the -oast two days the news from the interior ^ends to show that the rebels have dispersed to their homes. No report of this has been made up to now as the news is not believed by His Highness and anyhow the rebels cannpt be prevented from assembling again whenever they wish to. But I respect fully beg to deprecate strongly the sendong of another native infantry regiment, unless there is some reason for it of a secret nature which has not been communicated to me, for instance the creation of a British protectorate over Masqat and Matrah. If the above is my mental attitude it is re quested that you will consider what the Sultan and my foreign colleagues will probably think of the proposal. Heavy loss cannot be inflicted on the enemy by either two or ten battalions from a merely defensive position on the Matrah range, as the enemy are more mobile and will snipe at long ranges across difficult ravines and as soon as a superior force advances, will retire. To explain locally the despatch of ano.ther battalion merely for the defence of the two towns or the coast is beyond me. Knox.I 1 * TELEGRAM. From Birdwood • To Resident. Hanjam. No 1417.

It was found necessary in 1912 and also during the our» -rent year temporarily to increase our Consular guards both at lingah and Bandar Abbas for the protection of British lives and property , and at any moment we may,be faced with the same necessity. I know that any further depletion ^ojthe force at present in Bukhire is opposed by the Resident, and it would seem more than probable in view of telegram No 140 dated 8th of August from Masqat that it will be some considerable time before the troops can be moved from there. Further there has already been a piracy at the 'bar of the Shatt al Arab , and the despatch of ane of H.M , e shipd £o r the date season has been requested by H.M*s Consul at Mohammerah. It therefore seems to me very desirable under these circumstances and apart from the Masqat situation that our troops in the Gulg as a whole should in some wa^ be reinforced if possible , both to provide a sufficient margin of safety and in order to free our warships who are tied at present to Masqat. It seems to me that 4n explanation of the arrival of fresh troops at Masqat the Sultan and foreign Consuls might well be told £h^t it was necessary the exigencies of the climate /r must render continual outpost duty for so small a body of troops extremely trying at this season of the year, landing them from India on Persian territory would be very liable to misinterpretation.

After a little time, the tables may be turned and time may restore what you have lost. Then nothing will really be lost. And the terms on which peace is possible are that the possessions in their hands may be forgiven (left) to them. And 'ashoor may be restored to the rates of the time of Imam Azzan bin Kais. And the Bani Kiyam should be exempted from paying of duty. This is what they could agree to and we hinted that they should depart and not cause turmoil in Wadi Samail and should think well of Your Highness.

He does what He wishes and ordains as He pleases. They are like fire quick to be lighted and quick to be extinguished. Say ' God is the Lord of the Universe and gives possession to whomsoever He wishes and dispossesses whomsoever He likes ' (three or four more Ayahs quoted from A1 Kuran, rather illegibly). God has given you the forts without fighting. God is good, and gracious to you and others. This is a lesson for any one who has a living (/^.wakeful) heart. You should prove as God has said—'Those who, if we empowered them on earth, would observe prayers, give alms, promote good and prohibit evil.' God controls result of everything. Verily God does not spoil the reward of the good. Your goodness has not been in vain and God has granted you such happiness as you could not think of. So, congratulations to you on your victory.

FOLLOWING from consular officer at Bushire, 6tli July, No. 315, marked ' Urgent ' ' There has been considerable unrest recently in Oman, which appears now to have come to a head, safety of Muscat itself being threatened. In addition to other measures proposed was one for immediate transfer by to-morrow's mail of Rajputs, now at Bushire, to Muscat. Regarding this proposal I have wired following :— ' £ Muscat telegram No. 98. '' Strength of Rajputs at Bushire, exclusive of residency guard, guards at private houses, and guard at Kharag Island, is, roughly, 400 men. While recent action on Tangistan coast has undoubtedly excellent effect, considerable irritation has not unnaturally been aroused, and any wholesale reduction at the present moment of the troops at Bushire might conceivably invite repetition of incursion of 1909, when Tangistanis were able to bring some 1,000 men into Bushire. Governor himself has no troops at his disposal, and relies on presence of British force to maintain tranquillity. Under these circumstances, after consultation with the officer commanding the troops here, I doubt desirability of sending more than 200-250 men to Muscat. This will leave at Bushire, exclusive of guards, a force of 143 men and three machine guns, which number could be reinforced by 50 men and one machine gun from Kharag Island, leaving at the latter place a guard of 20 men. Troops are ready to embark on receipt of orders, and in the meantime I will endeavour to hold up mail steamer. ' ' (Addressed to Foreign Secretary; repeated to Muscat, Admiral, Chief of General Staff.)' ' I concur in the view that it would be undesirable entirely to denude Bushire of British Indian troops at the present moment. [2987 g—5]PEES1A.

Three of His Majesty's ships are now at Muscat, to which place 250 men of the 2nd Rajputs have also been despatched, but definite instructions have been issued that the men are not to be disembarked except for the actual defence of Muscat and Muttra, should such a step become necessary. At the same time a warning is to be issued to the leading sheikhs of Oman to the effect that, whatever differences they may have with their Sultan, the Government of India will not permit attacks on Muscat and Muttra. Your Excellency will observe that the warning is identical with that issued in 1895, the substance of which was forwarded to the Marquess of Dufferin in the Marquess of Salisbury's despatch No. 86 of the 13th March, 1896.

It is also reported that Juma bin Maktum, an uncle of the Shaikh of Bebai, will come to Maskat. He wrote to His Highness the Sultan from A1 Jau saying that he would await orders at Sohar.

THE Under-Secretary of State for India presents his compliments to the Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and forwards herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State, copy of a telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 8th July, 1913, regarding the situation at Muscat. India Office, July 8, 1913. Enclosure in No. 1. Government of India to the Marquess of Crewe. (Telegraphic.) P. J u ly 8, 1913. POLITICAL agent at Muscat telegraphs on the 6th instant:— This morning I was asked by the Sultan to give him assistance in defence of Muscat and Muttra. He was relying mainly on the Bani-bu-Ali. but they have retired upon Watiya, so that, with the Shihuh withdrawn to Sohar, the force at Bid is dispersed. The only obstacle between the rebels and Muscat now is the Bani-bu-Ali at Watiya. It is therefore quite probable that within three days an attack may be made. The rebels have completely surrounded Samail fort which is held by Syad Nadir with about seventy not very reliable men as garrison ; it will be difficult, therefore, for news to get through. ' There can be little doubt that one of the main causes of the Sultan's present trouble is the policy we have urged upon him ; he has been consistently loyal to us, and I trust, therefore, it will be found possible to give him full support. 'H.M.S. 'Philomel' and 'Odin' have already arrived off Muscat, and H.M.S. ' Pelorns' is expected this afternoon. I suggest that, pending clearing of situation, they may be ordered to remain here.' Suggestion is made by Intelligence Officer by telegraph that the 2nd Rajputs should be held in readiness to move from Bnshire, and that it would be a good thing if they could sail on mail boat, disembarking at Muttra on the 9th instant. He also asks that similarly warning be given to a battalion in India. This recommendation I endorse, and have# given instructions that, if the immediate despatch of a battalion from India is not decided upon, '250 of the Rajputs at Bushire shall be sent to Muscat at once ; they are not to disembark except in emergency to defend that town and Muttra. Please see conclusion of Lord Salisbury's despatch of the 30th August, 1895. In that year His Majesty's Government approved a warning being given to sheikhs of Oman that, in view of the importance of British interests, we would not permit any attack to be made on Muscat or Mnttra, however much the sheikhs and the Sultan might be at variance. In present situation there are additional reasons why we should adopt same policy. His Highness is probably correct in holding that the rising against him is largely due to the unpopularity Avhich his close connection with Great. Britain in suppressing the arms traffic has caused. I think that we cannot, in the circumstances, refuse to support him, provided that we do absolutely no more than defend the two towns ; and we accordingly propose to give Political Resident in Persian Gulf authority to repeat the warning of 1895 to the sheikhs.

The Marquess of Crewe thinks it probable that action, such as that recom mended by Sir P.

But having regard to all the circumstances he is definitely of opinion that the obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Suitan are sufficiently discharged by the aid they are affording in the defence of Maskat and Matrah, and consequently he agrees with the Government of India that the accepted policy of non-interven tion in the hinterland should be adhered to.

His Higiiness says that he does not want the money hut to reduce the Sheikh to submission Unfortunately, it is rather a case of Turkey and the powers They cannot coerce her without damaging their own subjects . In this case , it is very likely that British Subjects who have contracted in advance for the purchase of pomgranates will find their interests affected and, at any rate, pretend so , My sympathies in the matter are with His Highness, We should both be very glad of your opinion.4 Telegram, D.T.

It seems clear from the above that His High ness shares the idea that an attack by the Imam on Masqat and Mattrah is highly unlikely.

Dear Sir Percy, I an sending; you herewith two letters in duplicate which were sent to me toy His Highness for my information . The main point of interest is the pro^ecxeci. af&amp;ack on Sohar , which exercised me somewhat hut I discussed the matter fully with His Highness this morning and he made light of it declaring that the news was unreliable . He anticipates the next attack will he on Burka which will he a comparatively easy matter to deal with. He is as convinced as I am that the Imam will not venture an attack on Masqat or Muttra while the troops are here and he expects that the famicus meeting at Samail , preparatory to the grand attack, will merely result in the despatch of a old S*€UUtA} famous red 'bearded negotiator , whose name I forget for the / K moment , of the Hajariyin . I pressed His Highness to tell me what measures he proposed to take to put an end to the present j stale mate situation . I said I had no instructions yet to sound him on the subject and that it was within the hounds of possihil -ity that, to give him time. Government would permit their troops to remain on guard at Masqat for the whole cold weather hut sooner or later they were hound to get restive and want to know; what he and I were doing to hnng matters to a head . I then asked him to turn his consideration to the one weapon which he seems to have in his hands viz the raising of |f the land duties on dates as they come into the port of Masqat for export to foreign parts , We discussed this at some length and he said that I was hound to have a lot of trouble with British subjects who would buy the produce up country and thenl I represent the hardship of levying increased duties on their merchandise . The duty proposed was Ibp as against ftp , for which His Highness said there was precedent after the troubles of 189b. I myself have no great sympathy for British subjects 1 J(§) (3) Z2I exoept In regard to contracts entered into 'before the loeginning of the present troubles 'but it would 'be exceedingly useful to me if you could give rae some hints as to whether in your opinion I am right in raising the question of the extra duty or at least of remaining a passive,though not uninterested spectator while His H i ghness arranges for the levy of the increased rate already mentioned . I consider that my time for action will arrive when British subjects complain and then that all that I need do is to satisfy myself that they are not t)eing unduly hardly dealt with . But the burden of proving that their goods are innocent and that they are entitled to a refund of excess duty levied will rest on them . His Highness assures me that he is not out for money grubbing but merely wishes to reassert his authority over his rebellious tribesmen and I conceive that, in giving him all reasonable assistance to that end , I am merely carrying out the policy of Government , As special tribes and villages show their submission in some really substantial fashion His Highness will at once reduce the duty to the old level. The Grenadiers got in well and comfortably last Wednesday and the two wings combined hold the fan from the head of the Wadi al Kabir practically to Darsait . Watiya is just beyonft the line . H.M.S.'Fox' is here but *^1^ probably returns to India ab -ut the end of next weelc .

Dated and received 19th September 1913. (10.30 p.m.) With reference to telegram No.353-S. from the Foreign Department. The whole of the Batinah Coast, along which I have just 'been making a tour visiting Sohar, Khaburah, Suwaiq and Barkah, is quiet and there does not seem to be any fear of the rebels advancing. The situation therefore is that no' attack appears probable as long as Masqat and Matrah are held b^ British troops. In the mean time, however, the hold which the rebels have over the tribal lands of the interior is becoming stronger; the Sultan f 3 private lands are being confiscated and sold, and zakat is being collected from the numerous owners of date gardens who are not in a position to offer any resistance. As soon as the troops are withdrawn the rebels will therefore be in a better position than before for a renewal of their attempts on the ports of Matrah and Masqat, To enable him to resist them and bring them to their senses but twD fighting weapons are left to the Sultan, The prevention of supplies, such as rice, reaching the interior is the first and the second making dates brought into Masqat or i'atrah from the rebel valleys for export subject to a heavy punitive duty. Our troos have perfect facilities for stopping all arrivals and departures as far as supplies arriving or leaving by land are concerned. The proclamation of 1898 could be extended by the Sultan to cover any Kind of supplies in order to deal with those entering or leaving Masqat or Matrah by sea; in fact a naval blockade of the Batinah Coast could be declared, A notification might issue to all Persian Ports by telegraph, and information be conveyed as soon as possible to the Arab Shaikhs. Reference, is invited to my telegram Wo.168 of September 18th; our launches and men6 ^ O 50 0 men of war would have to support tlie Sultan in this measure. The passengers, crews and cargoes of native vessels which attempt to force the blockade could be transferred to the Wur-al-Bahr, which should be placed at the disposal of the Senior ftaval Officer, to be tanen to Masqat, and the nearest local i /Vali could take charge of the vessels themselves pending a settlement ot the matter.. The rebels should be reduced ncft to great straits by the blociiade, eVen supposing it/to be fully effective, and their rule made so very unpopular that they will be compelled to attemp am attack on the troops, make an unconditional surrender, or take flight from the land. Some loss to traders in general is involved by this proposal, and it Is a question to what extent French interests are affected and France may protest. At the same time they have infinitely smaller interests than we have, and when we are doing so much for the Sultan, it seems difficult for them to refuse to afford him such modest assistance. Notifications would merely have to be issued by the French Consul to French subjects that, for the time being, a state of blockade ' in regard to food supplies, and of course military stores, had been proclaimed on the Batinah. Coast. The Sultan is ready to ask for our cooperation, should these proposals be sanctioned in general, and details could be arranged in conjunction with him by the Senior Naval Officer and myself. Probably for a month the full effect of this would not be felt, and unless the remaining wing of the Grenadiers can relieve the Rajputs the latter should not be withdrawn from Masqat. Otherwise there will be an indefinite prolonging of this position of stalemate, and unless some unforeseen event occurs the Sultan's position will be worse than at our coming to his help in the first instance, when the with- I drawal of tiie troops is eventually decided upon. It is to be hoped on the other hand that the reduction of the garrison before next March will be rendered possible by a fairly effective blockade. I have consulted the S.N.O. and Officer Commanding Troops in regard to this telegram and they have expressed their concurrence. •ivnox.ILieut-0olon© 1 Sir i J Qroy Cox, C.U#!#, Political Heoident in the Persian Gulf« The Uon f ble Mr.J.

Extract from Masqat Political Hews for the week end- ing 13th September 1913,m Telegram - H, From - Resident, Bushire. To - Foreign, Simla. Repeated Masqat. No. 1627. Dated 21st September 1913. (4-23 p.m.). I V Please see Masqat telegram No. 169 of 19th September. I had intended to proceed Masqat a week hence, as soon as 'Lawrence' is available, and shall be glad if consi deration of any extensive measures for the solution of the Oman problem can be deferred until then. In the meantime there seem to me prima facie to be several flaws or drawbacks in Political Agent's present proposal regarding blockade and I had better perhaps state them now so that Masqat may have an opportunity of consi dering them and perhaps putting me right on some points. Firstly. H.M.S. 'Fox' is the only ship now available in the Gulf and I imagine that the Oo'mmander in Chief would have great difficulty in finding the ships for an effective blockade, during which also the arms trade from Qatar would have to be neglected. Secondly . If blockade is confined to the Batinah Coast I do not see how it can be effective; the rebel tribes have the season's dates to live on and if pushed could obtain sup plies through the Trucial Coast or Southern Oman Ports. Thirdly . While to seal Masqat and Mattrah against import and export and to conduct a close blockade of Batinah Ports would make conditions very penible for more loyal inhabi tants, I am not convinced that it would hit the rebel ele ment to the extent anticipated, but am rather inclined to believe that after our expensive operation was finished we should find the Sultan and ourselves in no better posi tion than we are now. It was my belief that if we could I li : t&gt; '* * have gone to Samail promptly in the first instance we should in any case have saved the situation as regards the security and trade of Masqat and should very likely have extinguished the rising. Since then disaffection has taken more effective hold and the situation become more difficult, and I doubt if any coercive measures which Government can be expected or recommended to take will provide a satisfactory solution. In fact I think the problem will now have to be treated on different lines altogether. But both as re gards blockade or other alternative courses I beg leave to postpone final observations and views until I have been to Masqat. As regards the retention of Indian troops, I am of opinion that 2 full double Companies, plus the head quarters of the regiment, total not less than 400 men, will suffice for existing requirements at Masqat - in the absence of serious developments in the near future; and that in order to avoid expense of employing two re giments, the lesser wing, provided that its strength is not less than 300 men, will serve the purpose at Bushire.

I saw His Highness this morning ,as I thought he might be disturbed about the Renter's annauncement which reached us this afternoon, I found that he had not even noticed it, if his own account is to be believed. I found that the translation which I gave him did not disturb him very much and he made no wry faces , when I translated faithfully that the 'Times' said that if he could not suppress the Imam, he would degenerate from Sultan (bo Sheikh of Masqat. I went on to ask about the town rumours, which my diary gives this week about Fakhl. He told me as follows:- The Sheikh of Nakhl is Hammad bin Thanaiyan ai Harrasi , The Fort of Nakhl , at the will of the people of Nakhl, was in charge of Tliani bin Harith al Jabari. When Nadir came out of Samaii,it was decided by the Sultan's sons,w2io were then at Sib and greatly incensed against the Bani Jabir, that the Fort of Nakhl should be handed o^er to the Sheikh , Hammad bin Thanaiyan.This has roused the hostility of the Ghafari tribes,and especially of the Bani Jabir,who are anxious that all the Ghafari should be in the same boat and not that Hammad bin Thanaiyan should get all the honour and glory,if matters turned out well for the SultanI I enclose a letter from Sheikh Hammad bin Thanaiyan with its enclosure , a usual fire breathing letter from Hamyar bin Nasir, Tamimah of the Bani Riyam, Yesterday Syuds Tfcmur and Thiyab (from Zanzibar) Sheikh Rashid al Azaiyaz and All Moosa, the arms dealer , went off in the 'Noor al Bahar' to Burka and hope to assist the garrison of Nakhl if opportunity offers. They had taken with them levies Ghafaris of various clans including some Bani Umar. The fact of All Moosa accompanying the party is interesting . He is troubled about his arms, of which he evidently has still(2) §// sufficient knocking about in Oraan^ancl particularly Naklil^ to malce it wortli his while to undertalce a Journey to Burka to try and prevent their falling into the Imam's hands , From 'both Syud a Ifsim and His Highness I understand that Ali Khan is not in particularly good odour just now . Of those six Lakhs of ammunit ion which he ordered some time back , five for the Sultan and one for himself , he has not yet 'been able to release a single one , as Syud Kasim has held them all up for want of 'bills of lading and delivery orders , He has 77 more boxes on their way out in the 'Markomannia' and it looks rather like as if matters / v / / were drifting towards a cause celebre between the Societe Francaise des Armes et munitions and Ali Moosa over this business o and it will be interesting to see how my ^1league is going to take i n this direction up the case , I am watching affairs as closely as I can . |/T''suppose you know ali^about the ten ca^es of rifles ^nd Fifty | cases partridges consigned, by the same VV looks as-if ray little deal with Khazal would not come off , I. &gt; ^ X \ r \ I am very sd^ry to hear about Lady Cox's illnes^ and hope to .see \ you both here soon with her quite Restored to healthy You and I \ seem likely to have a good deal to talk over.
