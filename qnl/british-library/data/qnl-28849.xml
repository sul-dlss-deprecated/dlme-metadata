When I was at home I understood that the Foreign Office practice was to allow a larger advance to be drawn in the third month of each quarter than in the two pre» ceding months. The cost of living and of entertaining here is very high and I do not thihfc an advance of 12 percent only in each quarter will be sufficient to meet it# Further under the Foreign Office system all travelling expenses have to be met by the officer out of his pay and recovered later when his quarterly account is settled wnich may involve in some cases a delay of several months.

(fyy ^0 {^1 crK Application of certain Foreirei oerv lce Acylations to the Persian Gulf Recently tv/o instances have occurred which have made it necessary to consider v/hether certain Forei gn Office Regulations sliould be applied to the Persian Gulf as soon as possiole and not at the time of the Foreign Office assumption of responsibility next April. The Regulations in question are those governing the maintenance of motor-cars and the drawing of travelling allowances. As the ministerial staff in the Persian Gulf posts is on deputation from the Government of India and the Government of Pakistan, it is clear that they vdll have to be paid their allowances in accordance with the old Government of India Rules, or according to any new ones made by the Government of India or Pakistan. With the superior officers the case is complicated by some of the officers being on contract to the C.R.O. (subsequently td the Foreign Office) while others are or will be career Foreign Servants, 15 Colonel Hay, in his letter at flag A, has suggested that o iicers might be allowed to draw travelling allowances under trie Indian Rules until 1st April next, thus giving time both for any anomalies in the Foreign Service Regulations to be noticed «nd-£pr the officers themselves to study the new Regulations, stresses that this procedure should only apply to journeys on tour and that for U.K, leave, first appointment and ^ a ^ on service, the Foreign Office Rules should apply, ' arguments in support of this contention may be summarised as follc&amp;rs: 47 .) )! nditing. fHe Accountant-General, Central Revenues, is responsible for- auditing the Persian Gulf accounts aid if •^reign Gervice Regulations are introduced now, he will have to ^ He furnished with copies of them and given an agreed date from — r v/3 ich the accounts of certain officers should be dealt with i a ' cora ^ n S to the IRS.Rules. As it is doubtful whether this cdild be arranged by the end of the year, the advantages of introducing/introducing a new system for a few months only seem rather In ill i 1 cm. (b) The clerical staff in the different Agencies and in the Indian Treasuries in the G-ulf would also have to accustom themselves to new regulations, and at the same time maintain a dual accounting system. (c) The Foreign Office will presumably between no 1st April, 1948, have to review the entire system of all payable to superior officers in the Gulf, e.g, the Gulf will have to be included in the Foreign Office List of uxmca.xoij.j stations and permission granted for paid recessing for approved periods and at approved stationstJc . The Foreign Service Regulation No.7 - Travelling Allowances is simple in application and need only be considered in the present connection in relation to journeys on tour. Under Section 8 the payment of the fare of the officer, and, in certain cases, his servant, is envisaged and under Section 10 a subsistence allowance is granted to meet the expenses of food and sleeping accommodation when not included in the fare. This subsistence allowance is 'at the rate in force' at the time for the country or countries in question. The Government of India Rules are rather more conrplicaoeu, making as they do provision for railway journeys which will not be normally obtain in the Gulf. The Regulations applicable are:- a conveyance or horse allowance (when specially sanctioned by the Government of India), a mileage allowance, a allowance or the actual cost of travelling. Without going into details the principle behind them is that an officer receives either double the cost of the fare for himself and part;. or else an allowance to cover incidentals when transport is provided by the State, As far as the maintenance of motor-cars ^ concerned, the 7 ° ve rnment of India principle is that an individual officer receives a motor-car on charge, pays its running expenses and is/is reimbursed for the journeys for v/hich he uses it on the puol, c service. The Foreign Office system is to make ^ allocation oi motor vehicles to the Head of a Mission who wien assigns them to his subordinates who pay at a fixed mileage rate for using the vehicle for pleasure, but its ■P,. maintenance, etc. is provided free. (The Foreicm “““ 5asr A possible solution would be in the case of:- o . fp. v .f. llin r-. To apply the Foreign ervice Regulations for journeys outside the Gulf in the cases of officers serving on contract and to maintain the G^ent of India Hulas for officers tourin. witSn \ 1 ' Admtted ly 321 anomaly will occur in the cases ' 0reign Se ^ts, but if they are to draw their ^ ^ thG Indian ^asuiles, it will be a ^ C ^ aimS f0r travel ling allowances to be an accordance with Government of India Rules, and the different entitlementbe adjusted at the presentation of the last India Office Budget. As far as i con discover, the Foreign Office fix subsistence rates in accoroance with local conditions, and they will have to ciae these rates either on the evidence supplied by this i-ice U.e. on the basis of allowances already sanctioned bv r , i 1 _ e ^ G ^ ve f nment ^ of India y , or by despatching an officer to the lj - }° aspect a^id to report. A solution of this point ox some immediate importance, as all officers, career or contract,, will presumably be required to do tours between now and April 1st, 1948. . . ^ l ' )/ tfPjraarSj x 1 he Indian Car Code might be maintained until April 1st, 1948, when presumably all venicles m the Gulf will come under the Foreign Office Car ool m matters of maintenance and supply.Ext 26iV47 Z 6 *■/ ? vojber, 1947. ^ith inference to your enquiry yesterday, I have discussed wit:, the Irc^suiy the question of air passages to the Persian Gulf for the wives and families of officers oho have accepted oontx'scts with you for scivice there, They agree that in any case such as that of Dredge, in w! ioh saoie tl :e rmst elapse betvsec. the departure of the offices’ fr «a his post and the procum.ont of see pnte^ngss for his wife and faiaily, air pau^mges mgr be provided for the latter at Govemncnt esnanse, X ending a &amp;&gt;py of tiiis let er to Slllssn at the Treasury, H, T, rennedy, »q.

Obviously, we thought, as the posts were suddenly coming over to us on August 15th we should have to taKe over a number of the subordinate staffs already en poste if our representation there was to continue smoothly and £he ~caange-over to proceed in an orderly manner. On the 1st August in our telegram 595 we asked you for recommendations for Office illowances for these posts in the' usual form but we nave as yet received no recommendations from you. In Tehran telegram Ho. 757 of the 6tn July you recommended certain establishments but it is impossible for us to judge from here what will be required in the long run. What we were concerned with was that v/e should obtain the services of the key officers and clinch their employment by August 15th. As regards subordinate staffs, there are clearly two periods, the first from August 15th until the Governments of India and^ Pakistan set up their posts, and the second the long-term staffing after that date. For the first period we hoped that you would immediately on August Ipth review the subordinate staffs at present employed at these three posts and reduce them at once to the minimum necessary for present commitments. Meanwhile we hoped that the officers in charge of these posts would be looking round for suitable Persian or Indian (temporary) employees to take the place, as soon as it could be arranged, of former Government of India Ministerial staff who could be progressively released. I do not know how far you iiave got with this but we h; ve now received an account from Meshed for the period August 15^h to the 30th September showing that some o subordinate staff (including 2 surgeons) would still appear to be employed there. In addition there are apparently one cleri-: at Birjand, 2 drivers and no less than 29 other menial staff. Similarly we have received from toe Political He si dent , Persian Gulf, a table of staff at xvhorramshahr from which it would not appear that there has been much reduction since the change-over. • As we have no author! t for any &lt; se staffs we shall | have to make a case to the Treasury for tTTeir retention and we^ must ask you urgently to supply us with a statement of the staff employed at each post on .ugust 15th together with their rates of j pay and showing v/hich of these have been kept on after August 15th and why, and how redactions are proceeding. Depending on the case you can make we shall then seek sanction for their retention at present rates of pay. But we all know that the Government of India staffed their posts on different lines from normal Foreign Office posts and we shall have to show how steps being taken to re-organise these posts and staff them as e c o noiiii colly/ A.

The .permissions required for the grant of sick leave are the same as those described in paragraph 2 of this Regulation. In the case of officers serving abroad, no reference need be made to the Foreign Office for any period of sick leave not exceeding 14 days. 16. The Secretary of State may require further medical certificates or periodical medical certificates reporting progress where he considers it desirable. 17. Sick leave on full pay may be granted for a period or periods not exceeding six months in the a Rg re g a te during any period of twelve months. An officer who has had sick leave on full pay for the maximum period may be granted sick leave on half pay, subject always to a maximum of twelve months’ sick leave (whether on whole or half pay) in any period of four years. Comment. Sick leave for periods not exceeding four days covered by a medical certificate (see paragraphs 14 and 15) are counted for the purpose of the appli cation of paragraph 17 above. 18. Where an officer has been granted the maximum amount of sick leave which can be granted on full or half pay, the grant of further sick leave will be con ditional on the receipt by the Secretary of State of a reliable medical certificate showing that the officer is considered likely to be able to resume his duties within a reasonable period. If further sick leave is granted, the officer may be paid a salary at the rate not exceeding the amount of pension (if any) for which he would have been qualified if he had retired for reasons of health at the time when his period of sick leave expired (hereafter referred to as pension rate of pay); or on half pay if this would be less than pension rate of pay. If the officer is unable to furnish a medical certificate as described above his retirement from the Service on grounds of ill-health will have to be considered. Comment. (1) Sick leave in excess of twelve months during any period of four years will not qualify for annual increments of salary, or for pension on retirement. (2) See paragraph 9 of this Regulation as to the taking of accrued ordinary leave at the end of sick leave in the case of an officer serving abroad. (3) See paragraph 3 (c) of this Regulation as regards officers falling sick during their ordinary leave. Ill-—Leave [General). .19. Every officer serving abroad must inform the Personnel Department, in advance if possible, of the date on which he intends to proceed on ordinary, sick or special leave, and of the address to which he is going. Every subsequent change of address must be reported to that Department. 20. Every officer serving abroad must inform the Personnel Department in advance of the date on which he intends to leave the United Kingdom in order to return to his post from leave. 21. The actual dates of every officer’s departure from his post and on leave and of his return must be officially reported to the Foreign Office bv tele gram in the case of heads of posts and by despatch in other cases. 22. When circumstances permit, officers will be expected to spend their ordinary leave in the United Kingdom in order that they may keep in touch with developments in this country. They will .be expected to undertake such tours or refresher courses and to pay such visits to Government Departments in London as are required of them. Time spent in this way will not count against leave. Officers will, during the period of such tours and visits, be eligible for subsistence allowance at the home rates. (See Regulation No. 7.) FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 7. TRAVELLING ALLOWANCES. r. This regulation applies exclusively to members of Branch A of the Service. 2. Whenever an officer makes a journey on public Service, the amount of the fares by rail, ship, air craft or motor car, as the case may be, for the journey in question by the approved route will be payable to him. Comment. The ' approved route ” means the route approved for the particular journey in question. In many cases there is a standard route for journeys, between different countries which will be the “ approved route.” An officer who makes the journey by a route other than the approved route [e.g., travels by air or in his own car when the approved route is by rail, &amp;c.) will not be able to claim more than the amount payable for a journey by the approved route. On the other hand, if the route which he takes is cheaper than the approved route he will not be able to claim more than the actual expenses incurred. 3. Journeys on the public Service include:— (a) Any journey made by an officer serving at home or abroad for the purpose of attending an inter national conference or discussion or consultation, or of making a tour or visit, which the officer makes with the authority of the Secretary of State. Comment. The Secretary of State may delegate to the Head of a Diplomatic Mission authority to sanction journeys by members of the Service in the terri tories within his jurisdiction. (b) Any journey from the United Kingdom made by an officer to his post abroad on his appoint ment to such post. (c) Any journey to his new post made by an officer on transfer from the place where the officer was previously serving or, if he was on leave at the time of transfer, from the place where he was spending his leave. If, however, the journey from the place where he was spending his leave is more expensive than the journey from his previous post, the officer will not be able to claim more than the amount payable in respect of a journey from the United Kingdom or from his previous post as the Secretary of State may decide. (d) Where the journey in the cases referred to in (b) and (c) above is made by an officer who is being moved at his own request before the completion of 3 years’ service at his post or by an officer who is being moved on account of misconduct, the officer would not be entitled to be repaid the cost of his travelling expenses. 4. The amount of the fares by rail, ship, aircraft or motor car, as the case may be, by an approved route, will be payable to an officer serving abroad:— (a) If he is proceeding from or returning to his post during ordinary leave, in the cases specified in paragraph 5 below. (b) If he is proceeding from or returning to his post during sick leave, in the cases specified in para graph 6 below. (c) If he is retiring on pension and is proceeding from his post to his place of retirement. If the journey to the place of his retirement is a more ex pensive journey than a journey to the United King dom, the officer will not be entitled to claim more than would be payable in respect of the journey to the United Kingdom. (d) An officer who retires in circumstances where he is not granteil a pension (t.e., at his own request or for misconduct) may not claim any travelling allowances on retirement. 5. An officer will only be entitled to receive the amount of fares in the cases referred to in para graph 4 (a) above (ordinary leave) after 24 months’ service at his post or, in the case of officers serving at certain posts or in certain countries which are regarded as unhealthy for purposes of leave, after 18 months' service. Where leave is taken in a country other than the United Kingdom, the amounts payable, in respect of fares will not usually be paid from public funds and will only be allowed if the Secretary of State decides that payment from public funds is warranted by the special circumstances of the. case and, in any case, will not exceed those which would be payable in respect of a journey to or from the United Kingdom bv an approved route. If, however, the amount of the fares to or from the place at which leave is being taken is less than the amount of the fares for a journey to the United Kingdom, the officer will not receive more than the amount of the fares for the journey actually taken. Comment. An officer who receives travelling expenses for the purpose of proceeding on leave to the United Kingdom may be required during his sfay to visit industrial areas, to study aspects of the national life on which it is his duty to be informed, or to consult with Government Departments. Any time so spent will be additional to authorised leave. 6. In the cases referred to in paragraph 4 (b) above (sick leave), the Secretary of State may at his discretion allow the payment to the officer of the amount of the fares from his post to such place asthe officer may proceed under medical advice on health grounds or for the purposes of undergoing treatment which is not available locally. Comment. The Secretary of State will require, before sanc tioning the payment of the amount of fares under the above paragraph, the production of a certificate by a duly qualified medical practitioner that it is necessary for the officer to proceed to the place to which the journey is made on health grounds. 7.—(«} An officer who is making a journey in any of the cases referred to in (£&gt;) or (c) of paragraph 3 or in (a) or (c) of paragraph 4 above will be entitled to receive the amount of the fares by the approved route for members of his family, as defined in para graph (b) below. In the cases referred to in (a) of paragraph 3 and (6) of paragraph 4 he will only be entitled to receive the amounts of the fares for any members of his family if the Secretary of State in any particular case so decides. Comment. Married officers in Grades 7 to 9, and un married officers in Grades 4, 5, 6: 2; Other officers: 1; except that in the cases referred to in (a) of para graph 4 (ordinary leave) the maximum number of servants is— Heads of Missions: 3; Married officers in Grades 4 to 6 (other than Heads of Missions): 2; Other officers: 1. Comment. Comments (1) and (2) to paragraph 7 («) above also apply to the case of servants. (c) Where an officer serving abroad dies, leaving at his post servants whom he had brought from the United Kingdom or elsewhere to his post and for whose return to their homes he had made himself responsible, the amount of the fares for such ser vants (within the limits of (b) above) for a journey from his post to their homes will be paid on request up to the amount of the fares to the United Kingdom. ( 1 ) Families will be expected to travel together. Where the officer’s family do not travel with him their expenses will not be paid unless the Secre tary of State is satisfied that there was a good reason for separate journeys. (2) Travelling expenses will be allowed for an officer's wife in cases under (a) of paragraph 3 only where the Secretary of State has .been satis fied in advance that it was necessary or desirable for her to accompany the officer. (3) Where, for the reasons given in paragraphs 3 (d) and 4 (d), the officer is not entitled to receive the amount of the fares for himself, he will not be able to claim them for his family. (b) The members of an officer’s family referred to in (a) above are— (i) his wife, or if he is unmarried or a widower and is not living in an hotel, a sister or other relative who lives with him and acts as his hostess; (ii) sons who at the time of the commencement of the journey are under 16 years of age, or who, though 16 years of age or o’ver, reside with and are dependent on their father by reason of physical or mental infirmity; (iii) unmarried daughters residing with and de pendent on their father; (iv) sons up to the age of 18 years who are resident at their father’s post abroad and are receiving full-time education at that post Comment. Adopted or step-sons or daughters are included in the above enumeration. (c) The amount of the fares of the members of the family of an officer serving abroad who dies, leaving his family abroad, for a journey from the place where they are to go, will be paid at the request of his widow or other member of his family up to the amount of the fares from the officer’s post to the United Kingdom. (rf) If a member of the family of an officer serving abroad who is resident with the officer at his post is seriously ill and is required to proceed elsewhere on health grounds or for the purposes of treatment, the Secretary of State may, at his discretion, allow pay ment to the officer of the return fares of the sick person and (where necessary) another person travel ling with the smk person, from the officer’s post to such place as the sick person may proceed on medical advice. Comment. The comment to paragraph 6 above applies here. An officer who is making a journey in any ^ the cases referred to in (ft) or \c) of paragraph 3 («) or (c) of paragraph 4 above will be entitled to receive the amount of the fares by the approved oaragranh the Hmits s f&gt; ec &gt;^ d in paragraph (b) below'). The Secretary of State may in special circumstances authorise the payment of the fares of a servant accompanying the officer in the cases referred to in (b) of paragraph 4 (provided no member of the family is also accompanying tS officer) and (a) of paragraph 3 above. Y § ^ ?L The L maxirnuni number of servants in respect of whorn the amounts of fares may be paid are Heads of Missions: 5; , Head”^ &lt;• 5 and 6 ( ° thCT th *' cniiwuiiLo ui idles are the previous paragraphs of this Regulation, these fares wHl be (a) in the case of the officer or members of his family, first-class fares, including sleeping berths, for a land journey, (b) in the case of ser vants, third-class fares in the United Kingdom and second-class fares elsewhere. Where, however, the servant is a nurse or governess travelling with the officer s child or children of 10 years of age or under a first-class fare will be paid. '(This does not apply to a journey or part of a journey by land where (a) there is only one such child, or (b) first-class sleeping accommodation is obtainable on payment of a supplement to a second-class fare, in which case this supplement .will be payable.) First-class fares will however, be payable in respect of servants in cases where no second-class accommodation is available or, in exceptional cases abroad, where the Secretary o state is satisfied that second-class accommodation is unsuitable for Europeans. .. IO -—(«) In any case where the amount of fares is payable under, the preceding paragraphs of this regu ation, except in the case of journeys on ordinary and sick leave, a subsistence allowance will be granted to meet the expenses of food and sleeping accommodation, where these are not included in the tare. The subsistence allowance will be at the rate in force at the time for the countries traversed by ■ the approved route or for journeys by sea. (b) Full subsistence allowance will be payable in respect of the officer himself, three-quarters of the full allowance for hi s wdfe. one-half of the full allow ance or every other member of his family above the age of 12 months, and three-eighths of the full allowance for servants, subject to the limitation as of th“Re^laUo? Wn ,n para S ra P hs 7 (6) and 8 (6) (c) Where some, but not all, of the items for which subsistence allowance is granted are provided under the fare, the subsistence allowance will be proportionately reduced. Comment. (1) If an officer is allowed the expenses of a sleeping berth on a long journey he will receive only two-thirds of the subsistence allowance to meet the cost of his food. (2) Subsistence allowances are payable only in Ca ^ eS n' V ^ ere „ fares are P a y abl e or if the expenses which the allowance is designed to meet are not covered by the payment of a fare. Consequently they are payable, inter aha, in the cases in 7 (c) or 8 (c), but not in cases under 3 (d) or 4 (d) ( 3 ) bee the comment to paragraph 2 above. 11.

Where an officer is proceeding to his post on transfer or on first appointment abroad or having7 his post on retirement on pension or on an appoint ment to the United Kingdom, or when an officer dies while serving abroad, the cost of transporting his personal effects by an approved route and method of transport will be allowed up to such amount as the Secretary of State may consider to be reason able, except in the circumstances indicated in para graphs 3 {d) and 4 (rf). Comment. (1) This paragraph applies to heavy luggage containing personal effects as opposed to ordinary travelling luggage, which goes under paragraph 11 above, and the furniture which is ^lealt with in paragraph 13 below. It includes such things as clothes, household linen, books and small articles of decoration. Ihe cost of transporting heavy articles such as pianos, radiograms and large gramophones would not be allowed under this head. As regards the transport of motor cars, see paragraph 16. (2) Comments (1) and (3) to paragraph 7 above also apply here. 13.—(a) Where an officer is appointed or trans ferred to a post and has been authorised by the Secretary of State to rent unfurnished accommoda tion, the cost of transporting the officer’s own furni ture by an approved route and method of transport to his post will be allowed, but only within the following limits:— (i) In the case of unmarried officers below Grade 6 up to 4 tons, or 800 cubic feet, or 23 cubic metres. (ii) In the case of married or unmarried officers of Grades x to 6, and married officers of lower grades, up to io£ tons, or 2,100 cubic feet, or 60 cubic metres. Comment. (1) The limits specified in (ii) above are the equivalent of about three van loads. (2) In order to ensure that claims for the cost of transporting furniture are as low as possible, officers should, whenever possible, obtain three competitive tenders for transport, including insur ance of the risk against damage in transport.- {b) Where an officer is allowed the cost of trans porting his furniture under (a) above but cannot immediately find suitable unfurnished accommodation at his new post, he will be allowed storage charges for furniture up to the limits specified in (a) above, for a reasonable period. Comment. The storage under (6) may be at his new post or his old post. The period allowed will not ordinarily exceed 3 months. (c) Where an officer has been given a rent allow ance for furnished accommodation or where his official residence, though furnished, has not been completely equipped, he will be allowed the cost of transporting by an approved route and method of transport any essential articles of furniture which are not included in the furniture provided. {d) Where an officer is leaving his post on retire ment on pension or on appointment to the United Kingdom, or when an officer serving abroad dies, the cost of transporting his furniture to the United Kingdom or place of retirement by an approved route and method of transport will be allowed up to the limits as to quantity specified in («) above, and up to (he limits as to cost of the transport to London. (e) Where the officer is being moved in the cir cumstances indicated in paragraphs 3 (tf) and 4 (d), no allowances can be claimed under this paragraph. 14. Where an officer serving abroad is, at the time of his transfer .to a new appointment, in pos session of furniture at his old post and is not granted an allowance for transferring his furniture to his new post under paragraph 13 («) above, the officer will, at his option, be allowed (unless the transfer is made in the circumstances indicated in paragraphs 3 (d) or 4 (d)) either the cost of removing the furni ture to London up to the limits of the quantity of furniture specified in 13 (a), or the cost of storing the furniture up to these limits a# to quantity, and up to the limits as to cost of the transport of the furniture to London. Comment. If the officer is subsequently transferred to another .post abroad in circumstances where he may be allowed the cost of removing his furniture to this post, he is then eligible to apply for the cost of removing his furniture under paragraph 13 (a) from London or the place abroad where he stored it, as the case may be. If he retires on pension or dies and his furniture has been stored abroad under paragraph 14, application may be made for the cost of removing his furniture to London under paragraph 13 (d). hS- («) Where an allowance is granted for the purpose of removing furniture under paragraphs 13 (a) or (d) or 14, or of removing essential articles ot lumituie under paragraph 13 (c) or of removing heavy luggage under paragraph 12, the reasonable cost of insuring during transit will also be allowed up to the limits specified in (6) below. Comment. Only the premium to cover the additional risks on removal will be allowed. No allowance for insurance will be given in so far as the risk is covered by the contract of removal and therefore covered by the allowances for removal. (b) The limits referred to in (a) of this paragraph (i) Where an allowance for the removal of furni ture has been given, under paragraph 13 (a). The total value of all insured property shall not exceed— In the case of the Head of a Mission 5,000 In the case of Officers in Grades 4, 5 and 6 (other than Heads of Mis sions) .. ... ... ... ... 3,000 In the case of other married officers ... 2,000 In the case of other unmarried officers 1,000 (ii) Where an allowance for the removal of essential articles of furniture has been given, under paragraph 13 (c). The total value of all insured property shall not exceed— In the case of the Head of a Mission 4,000 In the case of Officers in Grades 4, 5 and 6 (other than Heads of Mis sions) ... ... ... .... ... 2.000 In the case of other married officers ... 1,500 In the case of other unmarried officers 750 (iii) Where an allowance for the removal of personal effects only has been given, under para graph 12 The total value of all insured property shall not exceed— In the case of the Head of a Mission 2,000 In the case of Officers in Grades 4, 5 and 6 (other than Heads of Mis sions) ... ... ... ... ... 1,500 In the case of other married officers ... 1,000 In the case of other unmarried officers 500 16. Where an officer is appointed or transferred to a post at which it is necessary for the proper execution of his duties that he should have his own private motor car and where the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is not possible for the officer to purchase a car locally on reasonable conditions, the cost of transporting a car from the United Kingdom or from his previous post by an approved route and method of transport will be allowea. Comment. The motor car need not be included within the limits as regards weight and cubic capacity specified in paragraph 13 above. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 8. RENT ALLOWANCES. 1. A member of Branch A of the Foreign Service serving abroad at a post at which a furnished resi dence is not provided, will receive a rent allowance sufficient, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, to enable him to defray the cost of renting suitable furnished accommodation, excluding services and other tenant’s charges. Alternatively, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, an officer may be provided with a rent allowance sufficient to enable him to defray the cost ot renting suitable unfurnished accommodation, excluding services and other tenant’s charges, where, under the provisions and wi/thin the limits of paragraph 13 (a) of Regula tion No. 7, he is entitled to claim the cost of trans porting his own furniture to his post. Comment. The Ministry of Works Regulations regarding Government property will apply in all cases where Government furniture is provided. No charge will be made for the use of Government furniture.2. The rent allowance becomes payable from the date whe i an officer arrives at his post unless he is granted a subsistence allowance, in which case it becomes payable when this allowance terminates. Subject to paragraph 4 below, rent allowance ceases to be. payable on the day on which the officer leaves his post cm termination of his appointment. 3. An officer who is unable ito find suitable accom- mcdation immediately on arrival at his new post may be allowed to claim, in lieu of foreign and rent allowances, subsistence allowance for himself and for each member of his familv (including servants) for whom fares are payable from public funds, for a period not normally exceeding 28 davs and at the rates specified in paragraph 10 of Regulation No. 7. 4. Where an officer who has been granted a rent allowance is transferred to another post otherwise than at his own request and can shew that he has been unable to dispose of the lease of his residence, he will be allowed to claim, as compensation for the rent for which he is liable, a sum which shall not exceed the rent allowance previously granted to him, for a period which will be determined by the Secre tary of State but which will not exceed three months except in special cases. 5. An officer w'ho has been granted a rent allow ance may receive that allowance during the periods of authorised absence if the Secretary of State is satisfied that he has not been able to sub-let. Comment. Officers who rent accommodation must furnish a certificate from the Head of the Diplomatic Mis sion or the Superintending consular officer—as the case may be—that they have made the most economical arrangements consistent with their rank and requirements. They must themselves defray any additional expenditure on rent which may be caused by maintaining larger or more expensive establishments than are necessary. They must also endeavour to obtain a clause (known as a “ diplomatic clause ”) in the lease enabling them to terminate it at short notice in the event of transfer before its expiry. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 9. LANGUAGE ALLOWANCES. r. A language allowance of £100 a year (taxable) will be payable to any officer of Branch A of the Foreign Service of the rank of Grade 6 or below- (i.e., of the rank of Counsellor, Consul-General or below) who is certified by the Civil Service Commission to have passed an examination in and to possess a competent knowledge, colloquial and otherwise, for ordinary purposes, of any of the following languages: — Class I. Chinese. Siamese. Arabic. Japanese. Amharic. Persian. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 10. TRANSFERS AND PROMOTIONS. This regulation applies to members of Branch A of the Foreign Service. 1. In regard to all appointments whatever in the Service, the Secretary of State will be free to make any such selection as, on his ow-n responsibility, he may deem right w-ithout being bound by claims founded on seniority or on membership of the Service. Comments. (1) The Secretary of State is not bound by the recommendations referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 below. (2) In accordance w-ith Article 5 (3) of the Foreign Service Order in Council, 1943, the secondment or appointment of Foreign Service officers to posts outside the Foreign Service will not be excluded when it can be showm to be useful to the public service. 2. All members of the Service, whether married or unmarried, must be prepared to go to any post at which their services may be required. Comment. When appointments and transfers are made account will be taken, so far as possible, of the circumstances and w-ishes of the individual; members of the Service will, however, be expected, save in exceptional circumstances, to regard an intimation that they are to be transferred to a certain post as an order and not as a request. 3. Recommendations for transfers and promotions m or to Grade 6 or higher grades will be made to the Secretary of State by the Promotions Board. Comment. The Promotions Board will be convened by the Permanent Under-Secretary as and when he con siders it desirable for the purpose of advising the Secretary of State on appointments to higher posts in the Service as well as on other administrative or disciplinary questions. The Board will sit under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Under- Secfetary of State and will ordinarily consist of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the Deputy and Assistant Under-Secretaries of State, the head of the Personnel Department, and the Principal Private Secretary to the Secretary of State. The President of the Board of Trade w-ill be represented when appropriate. 1 „— , &lt;010 promotion k 1 0 Ii, t0 ^ ,;acles 7 - 8 and 9 of Branch A will be mad by the Personnel Department in consultation witl ,, e ! nv ate Secretary to the Secretary of State an&lt; the head of Department and Under-Secretary con cerned.

The allowance may be increased to £200 a year (taxable) to officers who acquire a high standard of proficiency, sufficient to enable them to act as interpreters, in any of the languages in Class I. Comment. (1) Members of Branch A of the Foreign Service will be expected, wherever possible, to learn the language of the countrv in w-hich they are posted. (2) Candidates for any of the allow-ances specified in this Regulation will normally be required to pay their own teachers’ fees, except n the case of those officers w r ho on first appoint ment abroad are instructed to devote themselves primarily to acquiring a thorough knowledge of Chinese Japanese, Siamese, Persian, Russian, Arabic, Turkish or Amharic. (3) Officers who learn a language (other than rench) for which no annual allowance is payable sca^e bC allowed teachers ' fees on a reasonable 3 - Language allowances will be payable only while the officer holds a post in a country where the language for which he has been granted an allow ance is in current use. Comment. Not more than one such allowance will be pay able under the provisions of this paragraph. DISCIPLINARY QUESTIONS. I 'T'( i ) Pi 8 Regulation applies to all cases wher member of the Service is accused of a disciplin offence It does not apply to cases where an off is merely admonished. (ii) (a) In this Regulation the expression ' 1 ciphnary offence ” means conduct by a member the Service prejudicial to the interests of the Sen or unbefitting the position which he holds in Service, or disobedience of official instructions or C wi a th ha / aCte / tha r t a warnin g o r a reprimand w or without a transfer to another post may be appropriate penalty. ^ Jb) In this Regulation a “ grave disciplin offence means a disciplinary offence w-hich in opinion of the Secretary of State, is of so seriou character that dismissal from the Service or a red tion in rank or a loss of senioritv may be an apr priate penalty. y Comment to paragraph 1 (ii) ( a ) and (b)— It is not possible or desirable to attempt to down rules which determine in all circumstan hat conduct constitutes a disciplinary offence R ^rave disciplinary offence nor the penalty t w-ould be appropriate. There are certain Joui ra whlch . are reprehensible whatever rank of the member; in other cases conduct n be reprehensible if the member holds a high pt but less serious when the member is of jur status. There are also courses of conduct wh may most appropriately be dealt with by the H&lt; of the Post at which the officer is serving10 must therefore notify the Head of the Personnel Department of the facts of the case at the earliest possible moment. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 14. ACCEPTANCE OF FOREIGN DECORATIONS. 1. Generally speaking, members of the Foreign Service, like other persons in the service of the Crown, are not eligible for The King’s permission to accept and wear foreign decorations and medals. Such pennission may, however, be given in the case of decorations conferred for distinguished services in the saving of life, or, if such a case should arise, ser vices performed by a member of the Foreign Service while lent to a foreign Government, if he is paid by them and not from British public funds during the period of the loan. 2. A restricted form of permission may be granted in the case of decorations conferred in recognition of personal attentions to a foreign Sovereign or Head of State, or a member of a foreign Royal Family, on the occasion of State or official visits by such personages, in the case of decorations conferred upon His Majesty’s Ambassadors or Ministers abroad when The King pays a State visit to the countries to which they are accredited, and in the case of decora tions conferred upon Foreign Service officers when forming part of a Special Mission when The King is represented at a foreign Coronation, Wedding, Funeral, or similar occasion, or upon any diplomatic representative when specially accredited to represent His Majesty on such an occasion (but not on the members of his staff). 3. The King’s Regulations do not contemplate the grant of any permission for the acceptance and wearing of foreign decorations offered to His Majesty’s Ambassadors or Ministers abroad when leaving, even on final retirement. When, as some times happens, a foreign Sovereign or Head of State presents a departing Head of Mission with a decora tion without having given any previous notice, either to His Majesty’s Government or the recipient, of his intention to do so, and the recipient cannot decline it without giving offence, he should make it clear that he will not be able to wear it without The King’s permission. The grant of this, however, must not be expected, and if it is refused the most that the recipient may expect is permission to retain the decoration as a simple souvenir not to be worn. 4. In any case in which a member of the Foreign Service learns that the bestowal of a foreign decora tion upon him is in contemplation, his informant should be reminded of the desire of His Majesty’s Government to be consulted through the diplomatic channel before any final decision to confer it is taken, and clso, if the case is clearly of such a character, that their consent is not likely to be forth coming. In no case should the grant of The King’s permission be assumed. 5. Ihe foregoing applies equally to medals, includ ing State decorations not carrying membership of foreign Orders of Chivalry. Medals for saving or attempting to save life, whether awarded by the Head or Government of a foreign State or by private life-saving societies or institutions, may be accepted and worn without restriction. 6. The waves of members of the Foreign Service are regarded as subject to the same general disabili ties as their husbands where the acceptance of foreign honours is concerned. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 15. PRESENTATIONS. A member of the Foreign Service may not re ceive gifts or presentations, whether in the shape of money, goods, free passages, or other beneiits, trom any person in recognition of services rendered by virtue of his official position, or, in any case, from foreigners resident in the foreign country where that member is serving, without having first secured the permission of the Secretary of State. Comment. 1 his Regulation, which also applies to the families of members of the Foreign Service, should not be regarded as applying to small personal gifts such as may be received from colleagues and friends. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 16. PRIVATE OCCUPATIONS. 1. No member of the Foreign Service may, without the permission of the Secretary of State, accept any post in the management of any trading, commercial, industrial, financial, or professional firm or company. Comment. Permission under paragraph 1 is only likely to be given in very exceptional cases, for instance in some cases permission to become a director in a small private company which is confined to mem bers of the officer’s family may be given: or occa sionally an officer may be permitted temporarily to take some part in the organisation of a firm as executor for a deceased relative until new arrange ments for the carrying on of the firm’s business can be made. 2. —(1) No member of the Foreign Service may at any time engage in any activity which would in any way tend to impair his usefulness as a public servant. (2) No member of the Foreign Service may engage in any occupation or undertaking which might in any way conflict with the interests of the Service or be inconsistent with his position as a member of the Foreign Service. Comment. (1) There is, of course, nothing to prevent mem bers of the Service from becoming members of, or occupying posts on the Councils of, charitable or learned societies, provided that their responsi bilities in that concern are not serious enough to conilict with the discharge of their official duties and provided also that the activities of these socie ties are not such as to bring paragraph 2 (1) or (2) of this Regulation into play. (2) It is the duty of any member who may have any doubt as to the propriety of undertaking any particular work to consult the Head of the Personnel Department. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 17. ACCEPTANCE OF OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS. 1. The assent of the Secretary of State must be obtained before a member of Grades 1-5 of Branch A of the Foreign Service, after resignation or retire ment, accepts an appointment in a business or other body: — (а) which is in contractual relationship with the Government; (б) w hich is in receipt of any subsidies or their equivalent from the Government; (c) in which the Government is a shareholder; (d) which is in receipt from the Government of any loans, guarantees, or other forms of capital assistance; {e) with which Services or Departments or Branches of Government are, as a matter of course, in a special relationship; and if) any semi-public organisation brought into being by the Government and/or by Parliament. 2. After the lapse of two years from the date of retiiernent, such assent will no longer be required. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 18. INTEREST IN CONTRACTS. j . Any member of the Foreign Service having an interest in a company or partnership or business wim which a contract with a Government Office is concluded or may be concluded, must disclose the measure of that interest fully to the Deputy Under secretary of State for Administration in writing. 2. Any member who has occasion to come in con tact in his official capacity with any matter con cerning a company, partnership or other business concern in which he has an interest, must disclose that interest to the Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Administration. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Regulation do not, aowever, apply to the mere holding of shares in a public company by a member of the service unless such holding is so great as to give the member a controlling interest in the said company. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 19. BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY. 1. A member of the Foreign Service who becomes bankrupt or insolvent must at once report the fact to the Secretary of State. If the member is servingabroad, the report should be made through the Head oi the post at which he is serving. Failure to report this matter is a grave disciplinary offence. 2. A member who has reported his bankruptcy 01 insolvency must then at the earliest possible moment submit a complete statement of the facts of his case to the Secretary of State, who will decide, in his discretion, whether the circumstances are such as to call for disciplinary action under Regulation No. u. Comment. (ij If the officer who has become bankrupt or insolvent has committed any act of dishonesty or has otherwise acted discreditably, he may be dis missed. The Secretary of State may also take steps to prosecute the offender if there is evidence of the misappropriation of public monies. (2) Pending the result of any enquiry into his case, the officer concerned may be continued in his post unless there is prima facie reason to believe that public monies have been or are likely to be involved, in which case he will be suspended. (3) In no circumstances may an officer who is bankrupt or insolvent continue to be employed on duties involving the handling of public money. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 20. POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. A member of the Foreign Service seeking a seat in the House of Commons must resign from the Service before he issues his address to the electors or in any other manner publicly announces himself as a candidate. FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 21. OFFICIAL SECRETS AND CUSTODY OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. 1. It is the duty of every member of the Foreign Service to acquaint himself with the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts of 1911, 1920 and 1939. 2. Any offence under the Official Secrets Acts comitlitted by a member of the Foreign Service ;s, unless the member establishes extenuating circum stances, a grave disciplinary offence (see Foreign Service Regulation No. n), exposing the member to the disciplinary penalties for such an offence, whether or not he is also prosecuted for the criminal offence in the courts. Comment. The Official Secrets Acts apply to all confidential documents or information which come into the possession, custody or knowledge of members of the Service. Any improper communication of confidential documents or information is a criminal offence under these Acts, even if the communica tion is made to another person in His Majesty’s Service. It is also a criminal offence if a member of the Service fails to return official documents if their return is demanded by the Foreign Office (see paragraphs 10 and 11 below and comment thereto as regards members of the Service who have retired and as regards the papers of members * of the Service who die). The appendix to this Regulation gives extracts from the Official Secrets Acts containing those portions of them which are likely to be of most importance to members of the Service. Members of the Service, however, are not thereby excused from making themselves acquainted with the provisions of the Acts as a whole. No definition is given in the Acts of “official documents,’’ and there is no rule given in the Acts as to the burden of proof on the ques tion whether a document or information was “ entrusted in confidence.’’ So far as the appli cation of the Acts is concerned, it is for the courts to determine their effect, and the Secretary of State has no authority to give an official inter pretation of them. On the other hand, so far as disciplinary offences are concerned, it is within the power of the Secretary of State to make his own rules as to what shall be deemed to constitute “ official documents ” and as to what test shall be applied to determine whether information or documents are confidential. Certain rules for this purpose are inserted in paragraphs 6 and 7 below. 3. Negligence by a member of the Service in the custody, disposal or handling of official documents or in communicating confidential information is a disciplinary offence, and may be regarded as a grave disciplinary offence. 4. Any improper communication of confidential official documems or confidential official information, whether orally or in writing, is a disciplinary offence, and may be regarded as a grave disciplinary offence. 5. Any failure by a member of the Service to teturn to the Foreign Office official documents, if their return is demanded, is a disciplinary offence, and may be regarded as a grave disciplinary offence. 6. All information and documents falling within the classes specified in paragraph 7 of this Regulation shall, for the purposes of these Regulations and of deciding whether a disciplinary offence has been committed, be deemed to be confidential and official, unless the Secretary of State otherwise decides; and the onus of proof to show, in any case, that any information or any document falling within these classes is not confidential or is not official will rest upon the member of the Service concerned. Comment. In the case of information or documents not falling within the classes specified in paragraph 7 of this Regulation, the question whether they are official and confidential is left by these Regulations to be decided according to the circumstances of each case, without any rule placing the onus of proof on the officer concerned to show that they should not be held to be official or confidential. 7. —■(«) The classes of documents referred to in paragraph 6 above comprise all documents or corre spondence (and copies thereof) relating to any matter of official concern to any branch of His Majesty’s Service and emanating from or addressed to— (i) any diplomatic mission or consulate of His Majesty; (ii) any Department of any of His Majesty's Governments in the United Kingdom or the Dominions, or of the Governments of India or of any territory under British administration; (iii) any Department of any foreign Govern ment; (iv) any foreign diplomatic mission or consulate; (v) any person in the service of any of the diplomatic missions, consulates or Government Departments referred to in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above. (b) The classes of information referred to in para graph 6 above comprise all information relating to any matter of official concern to any branch of Mis Majesty’s Service and obtained orally from, or from documents or observation at, any of the sources specified in (i), (ii), (iii), -(iv) and (v) of sub-paragraph (a) above. Comment. (1) Documents and correspondence may be official and confidential under this paragraph, not withstanding that they have been addressed or sent in a personal farm or marked “ personal ” or “priv ite.” Indeed under the paragraph the pre sumption is that they are official and confidential. It is, in fact, a common practice to send most secret information or most confidential instruc tions in a letter so marked. Similarly, oral infor mation may be official and confidential although it has been given casually and in a non-official manner. (2) The enumeration in paragraph 7 is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. Written or oral communications from non-official persons relating to matters of official concern may often be confidential official information and, if in writ ing, official documents. As indicated by the com ment to paragraph 6, the difference between docu ments which are covered by the enume ration in paragraph 7 (a) and information covered by the enumeration in paragraph 7 (b), and documents or information not so covered, is that in the former case there is a strong prima facie pre sumption that the document or information is both official and confidential, and in the latter case there is no such presumption. 8. Members of the Foreign Service shall, on the outbreak of war or other emergency, destroy official documents which are in their possession or custody, in accordance with the instructions in force for such eventuality. Except in cases of emergency, they shall not destroy the originals or sole copies of official documents except under authority from the Foreign Office, unless it is clear that such documents do not possess, or no longer possess, any interest for the purpose of official record. They may, how ever, from time to time destroy surplus copies or documents of ephemeral interest, in accordance with standing instructions.9. —(a) Members of the Foreign Service must not, without the permission of the Secretaxy of State, publish any book or article, or give any public lecture or broadcast, which is based in whole or in part upon their experiences as members of the Ser vice or upon information obtained by them as a member of the Service. (6) The reproduction in extenso of unpublished official documents (and this includes memoranda prepared by officials in their official capacity and with access to official information) is not permitted. (c) Members of the Service, in publishing any book or article, or in giving any public lecture or broadcast talk (whether such book, lecture or talk is or is not based upon their experiences as members of the Service, or upon information obtained by them as members of the Service), must not, without the permission of the Secretary of State, refer to or permit any reference to be made to the position they hold or have held as a member of the Service. 10. Former members of the Foreign Service, or of those services which are now incorporated in the Foreign Service, remain subject to the Official Secrets Acts as regards all official documents and as regards all confidential information obtained by them while members of the Service. n. Whenever a member of the Service ceases to be a member, he shall inform the Secretary of State of all papers in his possession which come, or may reasonably be thought to come, under any of the provisions of this Regulation. The Secretary of State may then give directions as to the future custody and disposal of such papers. A failure by the member to comply with the provision of this paragraph, or with the directions of the Secretary of State under it, will be a matter of which the Secretary of State may take account in connexion with his recommendations to the Lords Commis sioners of His Majesty's Treasury as regards the award of a pension. Comment. When a member of the Foreign Service dies, he cannot by his will bequeath to any other person papers which are the property of His Majesty’s Government as official papers, nor can he give any right to his executors or legatees to read secret papers which he could not show to them in his lifetime. Members of the Service should make arrangements to secure that, on their death, all papers which might come under this Regulation are delivered to the Foreign Office for examination and decision as to their custody and disposal.

At a later stage we may have to make some provision for commercial work. e would prefer to leave these suggestions for the time being but the Political resident has recently emphasised to us the need for a second oiiicor at uscat and wo support this. Vhile we are therefore omitting for the time being tho additional posts he asks for at the Political Agencies at Bahrain, Kuwait, 3harja and &lt; atar, we should like to include the second A.8/9 post at uacat, and the training post at the mesidoncy of additional Under- joe i*o t ary.10 ./ 8# The pre-war officer establishment of the Persian Gulf Residency was 5 PERSIAN SIDE Bushire. 1 Political Resident and Consul General 1 Secretary to the Political Resident and Consul, Bushire 1 Under Secretary to the Political Resident 1 Personal Assistant to the Political Resident (There was also a Foreign Office Vice-Consul at Bushire).

The Vice-Consulate at Khorramshahr was raised to a Consulate and additional junior Officers were posted to Khorramshahr and to Bandar Abbas as Vice-Consuls. The post of the Secretary to the Political Resident and Consul at Bushire was split into two separate senior posts, and the Indian Political Service cadre provided the Vice-Consul at Bushire previously provided by the Foreign Office.2 . 10. At the end of the war, before it wis ^ecidfd that the Indian Political Service was to be wound tip, the question of the future requirements of Indian Political Service Officers to staff the Persian Gulf and South and East ‘Persian posts was exhaustively considered; and, at any rate so f ar as the Arab side of the Gulf is concerned, the recommendations then made are valid today. 11. It is desirable, if our administration is to keep pace with the development of our interests, that the plans already worked out for the Arab side should be implemented as soon as possible. You will appreciate that our posts on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf are not quite the same as the general run of diplomatic or consular posts. Much of the day to day work is of an executive and administrative nature. 12. With the exploration for oil on the Trucial Coast and our assumption of jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners it will be necessary to make the post of Political Officer, Trucial Coast, permanent, and to raise it to the status of a Political Agency - a senior post. It will later be necessary to post an Assistant Political Agent there in addition. The post of Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain, a temporary post for the last twenty years, should also be made permanent. There is no possibility of its being retrenched; and, with oil developments, there is already a case for an Assistant Political Agent at Qatar under the Bahrain Agency to assist the oil company and to administer the Qatar Order in Council, and perhaps for a second Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain in the near future. The Assistant Political Agent there is already overworked and his work is increasing. The same applies to Kuwait with the rapid development of oil resources that is now taking place; and the Assistant Political Agent at Muscat should be retained so that an officer will be available to make prolonged visits to the Sultan at Dhofar from time to time and also because of oil exploration projected in the Sultan's territories. 13. Since 1939 it has not been possible to fill the post of Personal Assistant to the Political Resident with an Officer. This was a post for a probationer under training and provided a valuable opportunity for young officers to get experience in the Persian Gulf and to study the languages. It has not been filled since 1939 because there have been no junior officers under training since then. I feel it should be filled again by a young officer as soon as possible. 14. The post of Under Secretary to the Political Resident has also from time to time been filled by a Gazetted Officer of the ministerial establishment because young officers of the Indian Political Service were not always available. With the growth of the oil companies and the administrative and legal problems that follow, certainly one officer, and perhaps two, will be required for this and a similar additional post to be created. 15- During the war the Ministry of Information provided a Public Relations Officer and the British Council provided an Educational Adviser for the Persian Gulf, stationed at Bahrain. The Ministry of Infomation have withdrawn the Public Relations Officer whose work is now done by the Political Agent, Bahrain. The British Council have been unable to find an Educational Adviser for Bahrain and Kuwait for over a year; and I have already suggested in ray demi-official letter No. 848-3 dated the 7tn May. 19^7r the creation of a combined post of Educational Adviser and Public Relations Officer for the Persian Gulf Residency. The post of the Public Relations Officer was, in its inception, held by an Indian Political Service Officer and this arrangement was only abandoned when it was no longer possible to spare a whole-time officer for the post. 16 ./16. To sura up I consider that the officers - excluding medical and other should he provided as soon as possible the G-ulf: RESIDENCY AT BAHRAIN 1 Resident 1 Secretary to the Resident 1 Under Secretary (plus a second in the near future) 1 Educational Adviser and Public Relations Officer 1 Personal Assistant to the Resident.

POLITICAL AGENCY AT KUWAIT 1 Political Agent 1 Assistant Political Agent. POLITICAL AGENCY AT MUSCAT 1 Political Agent, and 1 Assistant Political Agent. following cadre of specialist'officers - for the ^Arpb side of 13 Total Of these, 7 should be trained officers fit to hold a senior appointment at any time, and the remainder should be junior officers of staggered ages in various stages of training and experience. In addition, it will be necessary to train officers to fill the three new junior posts for Bahrain, the Trucial Coast and the Residency, which will have to be created in the near future; and to provide a training and leave reserve to maintain the cadre of 13 officers. The wastage of officers in the Gulf has been very high. Since 1939, 21 political officers have served on the Arab side of whom only 5 of those who can be said to be fully trained are now available for the posts of Political Agent and Assistant Political Agent - vide Appendix VI. 17. Before proceeding further I would emphasise the fact that the Foreign Office ought to post say three young officers at once to the Gulf for training. Of the officers shown in Appendix VI, the youngest, Hudson, is 31; and none except Hudson has less than 10 years civil service. Further, Tandy does not wish to serve any longer, and Ranee, in spite of my reconEnendations, is not being accorded an interview (c.f. my demi-official letter No. 1130-3 dated the 11th June , J3.947 1 to Bird, copy sent to you under my_p.T,. tto. ii^i-s'). It is essential th t some additional officers should be trained at once if we are to avoid a serious deterioration in the present standards of administration. 13. At the moment we are carrying on with a skeleton staff of experienced officers who are already trained. No young officers are coming on, all officers have large accumulations of leave which they cannot take, and, during the leave season, major decisions involving time and patient negotiationnegotiation (I rotor, for instance, to su^jaStases as the Abu Dhabi-Dubai boundary dispute) can onl “ 1 - - - denying officers their current earnings o reached by 1 ■ ■ L vg. L will deal with the subject of a training and leave rasIrvgT below. 19* Training : Before posting to the Persian Gulf all officers of the Indian Political Service (with the exception of the Personal Assistant to the Besident) had been trained in India in law, administration, and political subjects. Former officers of the Indian Civil Service and Indian Police arriving in the Gulf usually had seven years T service, and military officers three years’ civil in addition to their military service. Ordinarily, soon after arrival they were given study leave to assist them to learn either Arabic or Persian. The rules provide for the grant of a year’s leave for each language. During the war it was not possible, except in a few cases, to grant this leave to officers, and they had to learn both Arabic and Persian in what should have been their leisure hours. This imposed, in the Persian Gulf climate, a very heavy strain on the officers themselves and proved a very wasteful system. Only the most enthusiastic ever succeeded in fully qualifying themselves in the languages, and many officers returned to India without having learned them - their political and other experience of the Gulf being, for this reason, largely wasted. It will be necessary either to send officers to learn Arabic in a good climate before posting them to the Persian Gulf, or, alternatively, to provide training posts - such as that of the Personal Assistant to the Resident - in the Persian Gulf itself. None of the Bulers here - with the exception of Muscat - speaks any English at all; and the Trucial Shaikhs are particularly backward. 20. Foreign Service officers posted to the Persian Gulf will also need to be trained in law to exercise jurisdiction over British and American subjects and other foreign nationals. This, and the necessity of learning Arabic requires a training reserve. 21. Leave : The unenviable climate of the Persian Gulf makes it necessary for officers serving in the Persian Gulf to have regular leave, which, in turn, requires a leave reserve. Since 1939 » officers serving here have had only a fraction of the leave to which they are entitled, owing to the difficulty of replacing them. Indeed, the task of staffing the Persian Gulf has always, even in peace time, been one of very considerable difficulty; and the history of it has been a sorry story of officers who came, saw, and - with a few notable exceptions - returned to India before they had gained sufficient experience or knowledge of the languages to be really useful. The lack of proper housing for junior officers has also made the Persian Gulf a particularly unattractive place for young married officers.Inward Telegram to Commonwealth Relations Office CODE 1NDEXEP nq&gt; &amp; Ct*k EMI: POLITICAL RESIDENT IN TIE PEISIiJI CULP D. 6,15 p*r;i. 13 th November 194-7 R. 10.

It might be as well to secure Hudson’s agreement to his temporary posting elsewhere in the Gulf in an emergency or to fill a tei^porary leave vacancy should the Political Resident consider this necessary. Hudson informed lae that lie would be ready to leavu for the Gulf by January 1 t, 1 Yours sincerely. (K ll ftluntains the following particulars In the order named :■Printed in England. Aug. 1938.

CENTRAL TELEGRAPH STATION, TOWER CHAMBERS, MOORGATE, LONDON, E.C.2.? 9s'’ PEBSOMAL PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, dated 3J)fcfc October 1947 % With reference to recent telegraphic correspondence about postings there are one or two points not covered by my telegrams. 2. Firstly, you suggested in para 4 of your telegram No.14029 October 23rd that one of the officers to be sent for training might be posted as my Personal Assistant. The pay of the post of Personal Assistant before August 15th was only Rs.200 plus Rs.100 dearness allowance. For some reason which I have not yet been able fully to fathom the sanction for the payment of these emoluments is regarded as having lapsed since the 15th August. My daughter Mary is actually performing the duties that would normally be allotted to a Personal Assistant and I gathered from the Foreign Office that there was no objection to this provided she was not paid from Government funds. In the circumstances there is no sanction for the post of Personal Assistant and as the ( duties are already actually being performed by my / daughter there is no particular point in posting one of the trainees in that capacity. 3. With regard to the question of an incumbent for the post of Assistant Political Agent Bahrain I have suggested to W.O.P. Hodder of the Indian Police whom I know well that if he would like to be considered for the job he should apply to you. He was Senior Assistant Director of Intelligence in Quetta when I was A.G.G. As a Police officer he has much experience of Indian law and court procedure and presumably also of passport and visa matters. I doubt however whether he will volunteer. 4. It may also interest you to know that Schomberg has applied for a job however junior in the Gulf. He states 'I was a District Judge in Singapore with an English Bar before me and I used to know Arabic fluently*'. His date of birth is not given in 'Who's Yvho' but he must be over 67. Although he is fit in spite of his age I hardly think he can be expected to settle down E. P. Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office LONDON.down to the drudgery of court and office work at Bahrain and I am afraid the Political Agent and others might find him rather trying. I would at present h esi tate to recommend him even as a last resort.FOREIGN OFFICE, ^ ^ 8, Carlton House Terrace, S.W. i. INDEXED p&gt;3 &lt;/. 2/ J iLi 4-J Sto^bart has raised the question of uniform at Bahrein, I believe uniform is used there, and in due course no doubt the usual Foreign Service uniform will be what is re quired. Unfortunately the details of the new Foreign Service uniform have not yet been fixed. Unless therefore Hay is particularly anxious that Andrew and Stobart should have uniforms, I think they would be wise not to buy them now. You may care to consult Hay about this. Yours ever. (H.T. Kennedy) R.S. Hallows, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, King Charles Street, S.W.1 . Wk iffl Mr. Donaldst .ease see the Political Residents telegrams Nos. 10^6 of the 30th October and 1069 of the 25 th October, about postings in the Persian Gulf. Foreign Service Probationers. Hay reco .mends that Stobart be posted as Assistant Political Agent, Muscat, and attached to the Political Agent, Bahrain for training, and that Andrew should replace Croning as Uhder Secretary to the Political Resident when the latter gpes on leave at the end of December. The Foreign Office agree to this arrangement. We do not yet know whether it will be necessary to place Andrew on special duty at the Residency. He is not likely to arrive at Bahrain before December and Croning is due to vacate the post on the 31st December. The Foreign Office are writing to us in regard to the payment of kit allowances and the issue of clothing coupons, etc. I think they will propose that this should be done by us at their request, in accordance with their rules and that they will inform us of the amounts payable and the coupons allowed to the two Probationers, under Foreign Office Rules. The Foreign Office are making the necessary travel arrangements for these two officers through their own organisation. Post of Secretary to the Political Resident. The Foreign Office will now offer a contract to Dredge, for two years. They agree that temporary posting as Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, or to any of the Agencies in an emergency, or to fill a leave vacancy should form part of the terms of the contract. Post of Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain. I think we must accept Hay's view that Jackson should/should proceed as soon as possible to the Trucial Coast, 4s neither we, nor the Foreign Office, have anyone in view for the post of A.P.A. Bahrain^ U-I*. seems that the only possible arrangement for fil-iing this post, fnr the time being is for Dredge to be shared between the Residency and the Agency at Bahrain. Dredge has indicated to the Foreign Office that he ready to leave for the Gulf as soon as tb-®*-terms of his contract are settled. Mr. Kennedy (Forei^. *' Office) will continue to tiy and find a suitable person for this post, on a contract basis.

External Department The question has been discussed with Mr. Jai^s and Mr. Hallov/es and it is suggested that it might be best to adopt from the start the Foreign Office general practice in regard to payment of emoluments. Under this, the ofiicers would draw locally’ in respect of the period to the end of November, advances at a rate not exceeding per month 6yb of their gross total annual emoluments. At the end of December, a life certificate would be furnished to this department with a statement of the actual advances drawn, and the balance payable v.uld be paid into the officer's bank in this country.j If you agree, may X assume you will notify Sir R. Hay and arrange with him that the notification of advances drawn may include the name of the individual’s bank in this country. A copy of the communication to the Political Resident would be appreciated, 1*4 ■■ lb 260 LI ASecretary. External Department The question of \shat deductions are due in respect of income tax is a matter for the Inland Revenue authorities. If the file (which it is understood is required urgently) is returned to this Department we will take the matter up. In the meantime as it appears to be the intention that these officers should continue to receive approximately the same net emoluments as previously and as I assume the rates of emoluments were fixed accordingly I can only suggest that they should continue to be paid provisionally at the same net entitlement, the difference between these and the new gross entitlement being appropriated as provisional income tax. As regards paragraph 3 of the telegram, salary can be drawn in full or in part in this country as any individual desires. All that would be necessary would be for the officer to communicate with this Department (Mr. F.A. Callow) stating address of Bank to which payment is desired. Paragraph 4* This is usual.

He said it would be very difficult to find anybody but promised to look into it. The Foreign Office had not contemplated sending any new entrants out for training until the end of the year, ffe may have to press them further regarding provision of staff from their own resources since I do not think they are doing as much as they snould to help.

Apart from the . question whether Sir R. Hay can guarantee the continued administra tion of the Gulf in the event of officers being permitted to take the leave due to them under Indian Rules, the question arises how in individual cases leave passages to and from the Gulf should be paid. The following sets out the cases of individual officers: (1) Ex-I.P.S. officers now in Persian Gulf accepted for Foreign Service: Stewart — no immediate leave requirements Jackson — due for leave September/November* ( 2 ) Ex—I.P.S. officers now in Persian Gulf, either on contract or candidates for Foreign Service: JU. /&gt;^ ^ citf* w ’ Tandy (Contract) wishes for short leave ^arly summer 1948.

S (t+j u* O'H' /vr u* , As regards contract officers, the Foreign Office contract * * fai 9.6. tdi ' terms assume the officer begins service in the Persian Gulf and provide^: (a) One leave passage each way for officer and family. (b) One repatriation passage at end of contract. Provision for a free repatriation passage is also granted under Rule 12 of the Premature Retirement Rules, 19$7, to an officer* who proceeds on retirement or on leave preparatory to retirement to some part of the British Empire, intending ^o Settle there if permanently. t a.I presume that: *&gt;V (a) no repatriation passage under Premature Retirement Rules will be allowable to ex-officers of the I.P.S. who take up a three-year (or less) contract with H.M.G. in the Gulf p ^ CLtuftM W' cffUy- J&lt;w*CC ' /, \ /f» ^b; any sum standing to officer’s credit/under icasa concession arrangements will have automatically lapsed as from August 14th. If these presumptions are confirmed, officers under Class (2), if they are permitted to take leave earned under Indian Rules^ will L have to pay their own leave passages both ways, unless the Treasury can be persuaded to pay. Prasumabl^, however, the Treasury will in any case have to pay U.K./Persian Gulf passages to officers under Class ( 3 ). It might be possible to make out some case for the Treasury contributing to passages for officers under Class ( 2 ) on the grounds of equitable treatment, since it is purely a matter of chance that they have not been able before August 14th to take the leave due to them. ^3 ^03 fjflUAS Cic*vr(/} f ftojAAn* is JL( list** lyJl/f ^ 1l ^T^yXm ly/li*IS*, f /*** ^ /U ^ tSX&lt;/Uu /i* cuj J**- /&amp; itA** J&amp;y /4aJ l**' x+jlpf • i rf. ^ V rf.)

An officer who has submitted an application for permission to retire under these rules shall not be at liberty to cancel his application and, if on leave, to return to duty without the consent of the Governor General in the case of officers serving in connection with the affairs of the Federation or of the Governor in the case of officers serving in connection with the affairs of a Province. 8. —(i) An officer who has submitted an application for permission to retire under these rules may be permitted to take up other employment during the currency of his leave preparatory to retirement. (2) Such permission may be granted— (а) if the proposed employment lies in India, by the Governor General in the case of officers serving in connection with the affairs of the Federation or by the Governor in the case of officers serving in con nection with the affairs of a Province; (б) if the proposed employment lies elsewhere than in India, by the Secretary of State: Provided that an officer who has been granted permission to take up employment under this rule shall be precluded, save with the specific con sent of the Secretary of State from withdrawing his request for permission to retire and from returning to duty in India. (3) The Secretary of State, the Governor General or the Governor, as the case may be, shall have the right to withhold permission to take up employ ment under this rule in cases where the employment appears to him to be such as could not with (propriety be held 'by a person who is still in the service of the Crown in India; or, alternatively, to grant the desired permis sion in any such case subject to such conditions or restrictions as he may think necessary. 9 —(1) The right of any officer to receive or retain a pension under the provisions of these rules is subject to the right of the Secretary of State— (a) to reduce or withhold any pension, if the past service of the applicant is not approved, or if the pensioner after retirement is convicted of serious crime or is guilty of grave misconduct; and (b) in cases where an officer obtains, prior to, or within two years from, the date of his retirement under these rules, other employment under the Crown, to suspend payment, wholly or in part, while the officer con tinues to' be employed under the Crown, of the proportionate pension admissible under these rules. (2) In cases where a proportionate pension is suspended wholly or in part under clause (b) of the preceding sub-rule, the officer shall on the termination of his employment under the Crown receive the full proportionate pension under these rules in respect of his Indian service in addition to any pen sionary award that may be granted to him under the rules of the service in which he is employed after retiring from the Indian service. (3) For the purposes of this rule, the expression “ employment under the Crown ” shall be deemed to include employment under the Governments of Crown Colonies, Protectorates, and territories mandated to the British Government, but does not include employment under the Government of a self-governing Dominion or a State in India, or under a Local Authority.

Subject to the provisions of Rule 9, a pensionable officer who has been permitted by the Secretary of State to retire under these rules shall be entitled, if he has completed less than five years’ total service, to a gratuity equal to one month’s pay (at the rate drawn by the applicant while last on duty before his retirement), multiplied by the number of completed months of total service at the officer’s credit and divided by 12, and converted at the rate of is. qd. per rupee; and if he has completed five years’ total service 1 , to a pension of the amount shown in the Second Schedule. 11. A non-pensionable officer of a Railway Service, Class I, who may be permitted to retire prematurely under these rules shall be entitled to the Railway contribution or bonus to his Provident Fund under the Provident Fund Rules of the Railway, and his gratuity under the Gratuity Rules calcu lated as if he had been invalided from service. If the officer has elected to subscribe to the Sterling Branch of the State Railway Provident Fund, the payment of the amount due under this rule shall be made in sterling at the rate and in the place prescribed in the State Railway Provident Fund (Sterling Account) Rules, otherwise in rupees in India. 12 .—(1) In addition to the pension or gratuity referred to in rule 10 or the bonus and gratuity referred to in rule 11, any officer who has been permitted to retire under these rules (other than an officer who is entitled to the. pension specified in the Second Schedule as the maximum pension admissible under these rules to the service to which he belongs and when more than one method of calculating a pension is prescribed, for the method of calculating the pension actually adopted) and who proceeds on retirement or on leave preparatory to retirement to some part of the British Empire intending to settle there permanently, shall, subject to the provisions of rule 3 (2), be entitled to receive a gratuity equal to the cost, allowing for any special rebates admissible to railway officers, of first class fares and passages from the last place of his employment in India to his destination for himself, and for his wife and children if they were in India at the time of his pro ceeding on retirement or leave preparatory to retirement: Provided that except with the special sanction of the Secretary of State no gratuity shall be payable under this rule to an officer who is permitted to retire or to proceed on leave preparatory to retirement while employed elsewhere than in India and the amount of the gratuity (if any) payable to such an officer shall be such as the Secretary of State shall direct: Provided further that where there is no railway or steamer station at the mst place of employment of an officer permitted to retire under these rules, the overnor General, in the case of officers serving in connection with the .airs of the Federation, and the Governor, in the case of officers serving m connection with the affairs of a Province, may include in the gratuity of such officers an amount equivalent to the mileage allowance for his journey to the nearest station which would have been admissible to him under the travelling allowance rules applicable to him: Hp that ° fficerS ^ elon ' in ' t0 Railway services, class I, sha: journeys ffi 1 India 0 ^ m P ^ ° f the ° 0St ° f ISt class fares for railwa;A 2 5909 5 (2) For purposes of payment of this gratuity to officers proceeding to or via the United Kingdom, first-class fares and passages shall be first-class steamer or railway fares to Bombay plus cost, allowing for any special rebates admissible to railway officers, of first-class passage at B rates by the P. and O. Steam Navigation Company to London (all sea route); and in addition, railway fares from London to destination. These rates are payable irrespec tive of the line or class by which an officer or his family travels. (3) Payment of the gratuity admissible under this rule (excluding that portion representing railway tares from London, which shall be paid by the High Commissioner), shall be made by the Governor General or the Governor, as the case may be, before the officer leaves India. (4) The Governor General or the Governor, as the case may be, may sanction the payment of a gratuity calculated as in sub-rules (1) and (2) of this rule, but excluding the fares and passages of the officer himself, to the families of officers who are obliged by climatic or analogous reasons to leave later than the officer himself, or in advance of the officer but subsequent to the submission of his application to retire. (5) An officer who applies in India for permission to retire and who is permitted to leave India in anticipation of the sanction of the Secretary of State is eligible for the gratuity. In such cases, if the officer proceeds to the United Kingdom, the Governor General or the Governor, as the case may be, shall authorise the High Commissioner to make payment. (6) Officers who apply to retire while on leave in England and whose families are in India at the time when their retirement was sanctioned by the Secretary of State shall receive a portion of the gratuity equal to the cost, allowing for any special rebates admissible to railway officers, of first- class railway fares and passages for their families when the latter leave India. (7) In no case shall a gratuity admissible under this rule or any portion thereof be payable until the Secretary of State has sanctioned the officer’s retirement under these rules. (8) The gratuity admissible under this rule shall be reduced by the value of any benefit received under the provisions of Schedule IV to the Superior Civil Services Rules in respect of the journey referred to in sub-rule (1) above. (9) The gratuity paid to an officer under this rule shall, in the event of his being permitted to return to duty in India, be refunded. Such refunds may be made by deductions of 36 equal monthly instalments from the officer’s pay-bill, commencing with the first pay-bill drawn after return. (10) For the purpose of this rule the term children means legitimate children or step-children of an officer, whatever their age, who are wholly dependent on him. 13 (1) A member of the Indian Civil Service who retires under these rules may adopt at his option any one of the three following methods of retaining for his wife and children benefits, admissible under the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Regulations, namely: — (a) He may cease to make any contributions and payments under the regulations, and shall then retain only the right to a proportion of the contingent benefits under the regulations for his wife and children existing on the date of retirement, and for any children subsequently bom to that wife. This proportion shall be-equal to the number of his completed years’ total service divided by 25, and the calculation shall be based upon the pension admissible to the widow of an officer of the class to which he belonged at the time of his retirement.(b) He may continue up to his 51st birthday to make contributions under the regulations at the rates payable by him at the date of retirement, and shall then retain the right to the full contingent benefits admissible ander the regulations, according to his class on the date of his retire- mem for his wife existing at the date of retirement, and for any children by her, whether born before or after retirement. Under this alternative subscriptions will ibe payable under the ordinary regulations for each child, whether bom before or after retirement. In the event of the death of the wife, subscriptions at the ibachelor rate appropriate to the subscriber’s class on retirement will be payable until the age of 51 : Provided that in the case of a subscriber appointed to the Service before 1st April, 1910, all such contributions shall cease with effect from the date on which he would have completed 25 years’ service or from the 1st January, 1930, whichever is the later. (c) He may continue up to his 51st birthday to make contributions and payments under the Regulations at the rates which would have been payable tby him from time to time had he remained in the service. In that case he shall retain the full .benefits admissible under the regulations as if he had remained in the service until death or retirement with an ordinary pension: Provided that, in the event of the officer failing *to notify within three months of the date of his retirement the method selected by him, he shall be deemed to have elected the first of the above methods. (2) The Secretary of State shall make good to the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Fund under a suitable procedure any loss which may be estimated to be thrown upon it by the operation of this rule. 14 —(1) An officer of the Indian Army or the Royal Indian Navy or of the Indian Medical Service who retires under these rules may select anv one of the three following options with regard to his subscriptions under the Indian Military Service Family Pension Regulations or to the Indian Military Widows and Orphans’ Fund:— J (a} He may continue to subscribe at the half rate of subscription under . rticle 28 of the Indian Military Service Family Pension Regulations or rule 32 of the Indian Military Widows’ and Orphans’ Fund: or if a married subscriber under the Indian Military Service Family Pension Regulations, he may withdraw, receiving the refund authorised by Article 28. If he continues to subscribe he will retain the' same rights to con tingent benefits from the funds as if he had retired under the ordinary (b) He may cease to make any payments under the regulations except m so far as is provided by the last sentence of this clause, and shall then retain the right to contingent benefits at the rates admissible under the Regulations to the widow and children of an officer of the class to which at i h f 6 date of r etirement &gt; for his wife and children existing at that date, and for any children subsequently bom to that wife. Under an T dorfatl ' on payable under the ordinary rules for any child bom after retirement must, however, be paid by the officer if child 6511 ' 63 t0 retam any Fight t0 continuance of benefits for any such (c) He may continue up to his 55th birthday to make payments under the Regulations at the full rates applicable to the class which he wouldhave attained had he remained in the service until that date, and there after at half rates according to the class in which he is then subscribing. Any donation becoming due after the age of 55 will .be payable in full as in the case of ordinary retirements. His wife and children will in this case be eligible for the full benefits appropriate to the class in which he is subscribing at the date of death: Provided that in the event of the officer failing to notify within three months of the date of his retirement the option selected by him he shall be deemed to have selected the first of the above options.

This proportion shall be equal to the number of completed years during which he has subscribed divided by 25. (б) He may continue until the expiration of 25 years from the date on which he became a subscriber to make contributions under the rules at the rates which would have been payable by him from time to time had he remained in the Service. In that case he shall retain the full benefits admissible under the rules as if he had remained in the Service: Provided that, in the event of the officer failing to notify within three months of the date of his retirement the method selected by him he shall be deemed to have elected the first of the above methods.

I think it reasonable that officers now on leave in this country under Government of India rules should be allowed to take a reasonable amount of leave before taking up their contract posts. What can be regarded as ’’reasonable’' is difficult to find and Hay will have to help us in that as the administration of the Gulf must carry on. He might however be prepared to agree to two months leave with a maximum of three months. The other case (i.e. officers now in the Gulf but equally entitled to leave under Government of India rules) is unfortunately harder to deal with. Undoubtedly there is a case in equity and in our own interests (health and efficiency) for parallel treat ment. On the other hand, we would have to consider the effect on the continued administration of the Persian Gulf which is our primary concern. The proposal that these officers should interrupt their contracts (during which time they would, of course, get no pay or allowances or any travelling expenses) would mean in effect that we may have to find leave reserves for them for that period and also for their leave they earn under their proposed contracts. It will also mean that all contracts will expire at the same time whereas there is some advantage in their expiring over a period of say six months. I should be glad if you would/ E.P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l2 . would put our point of view to Hay and ask him if, in the event the second proposal is accepted, he can guarantee the continued administration of the Gulf on the understanding that no leave reserves can 'be provided from the Foreign Service except those already proposed (assuming that we can fill that programme). The foregoing is, of course, subject to Treasury concurrence and I am sending a copy of this letter to Heighten together with a copy of yours.GOHgIDKHTIAL .

W. 1 • X ~~r- The question has been raised 'by Hay in connection v/ith the last sentence o^ paragsajh. 2(a) of our telegram to the Political Resident of 20th July No.9340 whether the leave granted to ex-I.P.S. officers should count against their contracts or against their entitlement under Indian rules. All thsse officers will be entitled to take leave.or to draw leave pay, in respect ru**A of leave earned under Indian rules#up to a maximum of# month*.

P. DONALDSONNote on StaffinR of Posts unde r the Political Resident. Persian G-alf The Governraent of India 19th June ask 2 questions: in tneir demi-official telegrain No.4745 of ( 1are N.M.G.’s proposals for manning the Persian Gulf posts alter 15th August, 1947 in the light of the announcement of 3rd June. (2) Whether H.M.G. now contemplate taking over direct adiainistration of the Gulf before 1st April, 1948, 2. As regards ( 1 ) the posts in question are those held by I.P.d. officers Assistant Assistant Political Resident Secretary to Political Resident Under-Secretary to Political Resident (filled by Hr. Personal ..assistant to Political Resident (not at pro Political Agent, Kowoit ' n Bahrein filled) n u it Political Officer, Trucial Coast H Agent, nuscat «» «» a Croning) sene On 15th August next the I.P,S. will cease to exist as such, and it will be necessary to make provision for retaining the services of the officers requirea axter tnat date. This can bo done in one of two ways (a) by embodying t.lem in the Poroiga Service on a permanent basis, or ( n °) '°y giving them short term contracts with H.M.G. Some of the posts could also be filled by (c) sending out officers already in the I'orcign Service to fill them. incse possioilities are dealt with seriatim below: (a) The Civil Service Commission are going through the process of interviewing selected I.P.S. officers who have applied for the Foreign Service. This, however, is turning out to be a lengthy business as the .o.C. of course, not addressing themselves to the ad hoc selection of I.-tAo. jfficers who nave Gulf experience but are seeking.to fill vacancies for all branches of the Foreign Service from the whole range of the Indian Services. They have so far engaged only a single member of the Indian services with Gulf experience (ilr. Hallows). It is doubtful whether much can oe done to speed up further this process of selection by the Civil Service Commission, since it depends on the rate at which candidates can be sent home from India for interview. ( 0 ) It may be possible to retain the services of certain senior I.P.S, Oxiicers on short tern contracts, e.g. Sir R. Hay and Colonel Galloway but ^ ln:&gt;re douo ^^ ul whether the younger I.P.S. officers with Gulf experience . ,, 0 k/ ALl IJ1 g accept short term contracts (except perhaps for a few monens only) as this would naturally prejudice their chances of securing permanent employment in some other field. They will be at liberty to retire i-n ^ r ^ nt service on 15th August. Probably several of them could get ? 3 °}t S Wltn the 011 c bmpanics (l know of one who has received such an oiler). However H.H.G. must presumably offer these officers such shortterm contracts for t ho months ingncdlately succeeding 15th .^ugust unless there is tD he a complete hiatus in the administration. 3arlv stoes to this end are essential . These contracts might be in the form of extension of their present rates of pay and allowances for a given period, say up to 31st march, 194o. A list of present Persian G-ulf staff with their position is attached. (c) It seems dcsira.ble that the Foreign Office should send out at once one or two junior Foreign Service men to fill j unior -posts (o.g. . .ssistant Political Agent) though primarily witli the object of learning the job of being Political Officers. This i.i.11 help the Political Resident out with his staffing questions. In order to be much use they wi 11 have to learn —rabic and how to administer the Indian Legal Codes, Unless the Foreign Office take such steps there is a real danger of the Persian Gulf administration falling down in two or tiiree years owing to the lack of qualified officers. 3. To sum up the answer to tne Government of India . 1 s question (l). Since tnc Indian Political Service comes to an end on 15 th ...ugust the superior service oiiiccrs in tne Persian Gulf will then have to become the servants of n.L,G. after tnat da.to, and the staffing arrangements so far on these officers are ^concerned can thus no longer remain the responsibility of the Government oi IndP.&lt; Contracts wd-th selected officers v/ill have to bo entered into eitlier by tne Department which succeeds to the functions of the India Office or the Foreign Office on soon on possible. In either case it would seem most convenient for their salaries t j loo borne on the India Office vote after 15th ..ugust, for the rest of tao financial year 1947~4 j 3. Steps under (c) above might also be taken. 4. To turn now to the Government of India's question (2) - ‘..wether H.L.G. no.. contemplate taking over direct administration of the Gulf before 1st April, 19^3. Ly “direct administration' the Government of India mean in effect the provision of staff and services from U.X. sources, with rcgrjrd to superior staff, we have already seen that with the dissolution of the a.x. 3. on 15 th ..ugust the Government of India will no longer be in a position to supply^ such staff. The subordinate (or ministerial) staff at present employed belongs to the Government of India central subordinate services or is recruited locally. Unlike the I.P. 3 , these services will not cease to be on 15 tn ...ugust. Until suoordinate staff can be taicen into the Foreign Service, or new suoordinate staff recruited, it seems almost inevitable to Goverame ^ to continue to provide it on an agency basis until so ..pnl, 194P. The same applies to quarantine and medical (Indian meaical Department) Postal (Indian Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department) and P.J.D. staf 1 . It is douboful -whether it would be physically possible for H.M.G. to take Woo services over before April, 1948.

So far as I am aware they have, not yet engaged a single member of the Indian services with Gulf experience though one (Mr. Hallows) has been placed on their reserve list. It is necessary to ask the Foreign Office to speed up selection as much as p ossible. /('b)(b) It may be possible to retain the services of certain senior I.P*S. officers on contract, e.g. Sir R.

The same applies to quarantine and medical (Indian Medical Department) . r and Postal (Indian Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department) staff. I doubt whether it would be plysically possible for H.M.G. to take these services over before -^pril, 1948. It seems therefore that the answer to the Government of Indiana question must be that H.M.G. would like the Government of India to centime t provide ministerial (as well as medicalyeasebpostal) staff on an agency basis A until 1st April, 1948, as they previously agreed, but that since the I.P.S. will cease to exist from 15th August, H.M.G. will themselves have to take over responsibility for the provision of superior officers as from that date. 5* As soon as Sir R. Hay is available for consultation after his arrival in this country, which should be frem the week beginning 6th July, I suggest we should have a meeting with the Foreign Office and Treasury to discuss the above questions. A note or letter on the lines of this minute might be circulated in advance. fay - The selection of officers of the I.G.S. and the I.-f.S. for appointment to the Foreign Service is being conducted by the Civil Service Commission, not by the Foreign Office, though that Office is of course represented on the Interviewing Board. The selection is in fact being carried out as rapidly as the rate at which candidates can be sent home from India for interview permits and it would be pointless to ask the Foreign Office or the C.S.C. to speed it up.

Following is summary of decision. I have requested release on 15th August unless required to continue to act as Political Resident until the end of September to fulfil ray voluntary undertaking to do so. After that date I wish to be released, but if H.J4.G. is contemplating offering contracts I hope I shall be considered. Pelly wishes to be released on 15th August which is date of expiry of leave he is being granted on 17th July by Government of India. Hudson wishes to be released on 15th August. Continued employment of Pelly and Hudson under H.M.G. depends on result of their interviews. Tandy wishes to be released on 15th August but is prepared to postpone retirement if further service will count towards compensation and proportionate pension. If his services are required by H.M.G. on a temporary basis on existing terns he is prepared to retire forthwith® Pettigrew wishes to be released as urgently as possible. 3. i have no information of the decisions of officers on leave.PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN.

The leave an.d trai ling reserve was borne on the general cadre of the Indian political Service: but, i v ' practice, there has been no training reserve and only a most' inadequate leave reserve since 1939. This establishment had remained practically unchanged since 1908, in spite of the development of our interests in oil and strategic and civil air lines or the Arab side of the Gulf* 9. Early in the war it was found necessary to post a junior officer as Political Officer on_the Trucial Coast with headquarters at Sharjah; and later an Assistant Political Agent at Auscat to look after'the Southern Arabian air route ard to be with the Sultar who lives on the ^ix route. The Vice-Consulate at Ehorramshahr was raised to a Consulate and additional junior Officers were posted to Khorramshahr and to Bandar Abbas as Vice-Consuls. The post of the Secretary to the Political President a V3 d Consul at Bushire was split into two separate senior posts, and the Indian political Service cadre provided the Vice-Consul at Bushire previously provided by the Foreign Office. 10, At the end of the war, before it the Indian political Service was to be woimd of the future requirements of Indian Political to staff the Persian Gulf and exhaustively considered of the Gulf is concerned, today. and the was decided that up, the question Service Officers South and East Persian posts was at any rate so far as the Arab side recommendations then made are valid 11 . pace alre; soon Arab ener It is desirable, if our administration is to keep ;h the development of our interests, that the plans worked out for the Arab side should be implemented as possible. You will appreciate that our posts on the side of the Persian Gulf are not quite the same as the al run of diplomatic or consular posts. Kuch of the d( : is of an executive and administrative nature. day work is of .y to 12. Kith the exploration for oil on the Trucial Coast and our assumption of jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners it will be necessary to make the post of political_ Officer,‘Trucial Coast, permanent, and to raise it to the status of a Political Agency —a senior post. It will later be necessary to post an Assistant Political Agent there in addition.The post of Assistant Politr'cal Age if at Balifai^, a temporary post for the last twenty years, should also be fade permanent. There is no possibility of its be inn retrenched 1 : and', with oil developments, there is already case for ajui Assistant Political Agent at ^atar under the Bahrain''Agency to assist the Oil company and to administer the Qatar Order in Council, and perhaps for a second Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain in the near future. The Assistant Political Agent there is already overworked and his work is increasing. The same applies to Kuwait with the rapid development of oil resources that is bow taking place: and the Assistant political Agent at Muscat should be retained so that sin officer will be available to make prolonged visits to the 2 at Dhofar from time to time and also because of oil exploration projected in the Sultan’s territories. IS. Since 1939 it has not been possible to fill the post of personal Assistant to the Political Resident with an officer. This was a post for a probationer under training and provided a valuable opportunity for young officers to get experience in the Persian Gulf and to study the languages. It has not been filled since 1939 because there have been no junior officers under training since then. I feel it should be filled again by a young officer as soon as possible. 14. The post of Under Secretary to the Political Resident has also from time to time been filled by a Gazetted Officer of the ministerial establishment because young officers of the Indian political Service were not always available. With the growth of the oil companies and the administrative and legal problems that follow, certainly one officer, and perhaps two, will be required for this and a similar additional post to be created. 15. During the war the ministry of Information provided a Public Relations Officer and the British Council provided an Educational Adviser for the Persian Gulf, stationed at Bahrain. The Ministry of Information have withdrawn the public Relations Officer whose work is now done by the Political Agent, Bahrain. The British Council have been unable 'to find an educational Adviser for Bahrain and Kuwait for over a year*, and I have already suggested in my demi-official letter No.848-3 dated the 7th May, 1947, the creation of a combined post of Educational Adviser and Public Relations Officer for the Persian Gulf Residency. The *oost of the Public Relations Officer was, in its inception, held by an Indian Political Service.Officer and this arrangement was only abandoned when it was no longer possible to spare a whole-time officer for the post. 16. To sum up I consider that the following cadre of officers — excluding medical and other specialist officers — should be provided as soon as possible for the Arab side of the Gulf : BSiiAArcy xt 1 Resident 1 Secretary to the Resident. 1 Under Secretary (plus a second in the near future). 1 Educational Adviser and Public Relations Officer. 1 personal Assistant to the Resident. POLITICAL AGKiICY AT BnHRxIil 1 Political Agent. 1 Assistant Political Agent (plus a second in the near future). 1 Political Officer at ^atar. POLITICALPOLITICAL AGENCY AT ICJWAIT 1 Political Agant, 1 Assistant political Ageat* POLITICAL AGE.NCY AY OTSCAf ' 1 political Agemt, cuad 1 Assistant Political Agent* 15 Total* Of these, 7 should be trained officers fit to hold a senior appointment *t any time, and the remainder should be junior officers of staggered ages in various stages of training and experience* In addition^, it nill be necessary to train officers to fill the three new junior posts for Bahrain, the Trucial Coast and the Residency, which will have to be created in the near future: and to provide a training and leave reserve to maintain the cadre of 13 officers* The wastage of officers in the Saif has been very high. Since 1939, 21 political officers have served on the Arab side of whom only 5 of those who can be said to be fully trained are now available for the posts of Political Agent and Assistant political Agent — vide Appendix VI. 17 . Before proceeding further I would emphasise the fact that the Foreign Office ought to post say three young officers at once to the Gulf for training* Of the officers shown in A-pendlx VI, the youngest, Hudson, is 31$ and none except Hudson has less than 10 years civil service, further, Tandy does not wish to serve any longer, and Ranee, in spite of w recommendations, is net being accorded an interview (£.f v . my demi-official letter H0.1130-S dated the 11th June, 1947, to Bird, copy sent to you under my P.L* Ho.ll£l-b)* It is essential chat some additional officers should be trained at once if we are to avoid a serious deterioration in the present standards of administration. 18. At the moment we are carrying on with a skeleton staff of experienced officers who are already trained, ho young officers are coming on, all officers have large accumulations of leave which they cannot take, and, during the leave season, major decisions invoking time and patient negotiation (I refer, for instance, to such cases as the Abu Dhabi-Dubai boundary dispute) can only be reached oy denying officers their current earnings of leave. I will deal with the subject of a training and leave reserve below. 19 . Training t Before posting to the Persian Gulf all officers of the Indian Political Service (with the exception of the personal Assistant to the Resident) had been trained in India in law, administration, and political subjects. Former officers of the Isidian Civil Service and Indian police arriving in the Gulf usually had seven years 1 service, and military officers three years* civil in addition to their military service. OrdinarilyI Ordinarily, soon after arrival they Were' given study! leave assist then to learn either Arabic or Persian. The'tales provide for the grant of a year’s leave .for each language During the war it was grant this leave to officer; and Persian in what should have been their leisure hours. ux u _LCc*vt; .lor «acn language, not possible, except in a-few ceases, fficerSj and they had to learn both ^ to to •able This imposed, in the Persian Gulf climate, a very heavy strain on the officers themselves and proved a very wasteful system. Only the most enthusiastic ever succeeded in fully qualifying themselves in the languages, ard many officers returreto India without having learned them — their political and other experience of the Gulf being, for this reason, largely wasted. It*will be necessary either to send officers to learn Arabic in a good climate before posting them to the Persian Gulf, or, alternatively, to provide training posts — such as that of the personal Assistant to the Resident — in the Persian Gulf itself, hone of the halers here — with the exception of Auscat speaks any English at all; and the Trucial Shaikhs are particularly backward, 20. Foreign service officers posted to the Persian Gulf will also need to be trained in law to exercise Jurisdiction over British and American subjects a hd other foreign nationals. This, and the necessity of learning Arabic requires a training reserve. Leave ; The unenviable climate of the Persian Gulf akes it necessary for officers serving in the Persian Gulf to 21 . have regular leave, which, in turn, requires a leave reserve. Since 1229, officers servin 0, here have had only a fraction of the leave to which they aie htitled, owing to the difficulty of replacing then. Indeed, the task of staffing the Persian Gulf has always, even in ■oeace time, been one of very consider able difficulty, and the historv of'it has been a sorry story of officers who^came, saw, and —' with a few notable exceptions — returned to India before thev had ^ained sufficient experience or knowledge of tne languages to be really useful. The lack of proper housing for junior officers has also made the Persian Gull a particularly unattractive place for you ~o Aii**.ri i 22 x s the number of officers employed increases, the size of the ministerial establishment will have to be increased roughly in the proportion mentioned in para 27 below, altnoug , as the increase*will be in junior officers, a lower proportion may suffice. 22. The additional information required in para 4 of Wilson*s letter to you is given below : The non- gazetted ministerial stafi are divided into the following categories : (a) Lower Division; (b) Upper Division; (c) Special Grade. and The following are the scales of pay o^- each category ' a.)

The scales of pay of the Registrar and Treasury Officer and the Assistant Begistrar are as follows : Begistrar and Treasury Officer. pay Rs,400-20-500.

Rent free quarters or Bs.50/- per month house rent in lieu. Rearness allowances amounting, in the Residency, to 50 per cent of total emoluments are at present admissible to all members of the ministerial staff. The allowances vary in size from post to post according to the cost of living. The political Resident is at present reponsible for 24 the recruitment, promotion, and discipline of the ministerial establishments, both gazetted and non-gazetted. A copy of the nominal roll of the amalgamated ministerial cadre as it stood on the 1st hay, 1947, # is enclosed as Appendix VII. The scale of pay for each post (exclusive of dearness allowance) is shown in Appendix VIII. Clerks are recruited between the ages of 20 and 25 years, preference is given to graduates of Indian Universities and to qualified Accountants, Typists, and Stenographers. Their prospects of promotion can be Judged by comparing the nominal roll (Appendix VII), in which the age and grade of each clerk is shown, with the scales of pay for the post he holds (Appendix VIII). Since the war all recruitment has been made direct to the Upper Division because the pay of the Lower Division did not attract recruits of the right type. Wastage of clerks is high and prospects of promotion are, in consequence, good, promotions from the Upper Division to the Special Grade and to gazetted appointments are made by selection. 25. Ordinarily, all members of the non-gazetted staff are deputed in turn to work as typists, stenographers, despatch clerks, record keepers, accounts clerks anu head clerks. Anglo-Indian clerks also handle cyphers and do confidential work. Of the gazetted staff, the Assistant Secretary is in charge of the Cypher and Confidential Branch of the Residency; the Registrar and Treasury Officer is in charge of Finance and Establishment; Furniture26. The terrr 'gazetted officer' is ^appl’i^rd'^to all officers of the All-India services ard to certain officers of the Government of India Central Services. The neve is derived from the fact that any change in the posting or status of such a' officer has to be notified in the Gazette of India. Gazetted Officers of the Central Services of India are classified as Class I and Class II according to their states and the travelling allowance, etc. to which they are entitled varies according to the class to which they belong. So far as the Gulf ministerial staff is concerned a' Class I Gazetted officer might be roughly compared to an officer promoted from the ranks to hold the appointment of quartermaster and a Class II Gazetted Officer to c Currant Officer. 27. The average proportion of Gazetted ministerial officers and clerks to each Indian political Service Officer 1 ^ the whole establishment under the presidency is : 3/5 ministerial gazetted officer, and 6 clerks to each Indian Political Service Officer. 28. pensions : Under the special Persian Gulf Rules, the age for superannuation for the ministerial staff has been fixed at 50 years and the full retiring pens!or is granted after 25 years 1 service in the Persian Gulf. The amount of Pension is regulated as follows : after permanent service of less than 10 years, a gratuity not*exceeding one month*s emoluments for each completed year of service is granted; (b) after permanent service of more than 10 years and !«ss than 25 years the pension is calculated at N/60 of the monthly emoluments average of the last three years (IT re presenting the number of years counting for pension); and £9. ter completing 25 years service a ministerial Government servant becomes entitled to full pension calculated at 30/60 of the monthly emoluments of the last three years. allocation of pension cannot be made to dependants.

The Secretary also sometimes tours with the Resident; but more often remains at headquarters when the Resident goes on tour. The Secretary tours independently of the Resident to inspect the offices of subordinate posts. A Secretary who has not learned Arabic is expected to try to do so in his leisure hours.THE UND;iR SECRE T ARY is the head of the Confidential Office, in which all con fidential and political work is done. He drafts and notes for the Resident and disposes of references on the confidential side which do not require the Residents personal attention. THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY if responsible for supervision of the confidential office. All confidential and political work passes through him and it is his responsibility to see that papers are properly put up, to note on casea dhd to draft. He is in charge of cyphers and is respon sible for security under the Under Secretary's orders. THE SPECIAL GRADS CYPHER CLERK is in charge of the Cypher Section and is responsible for its supervision, the preparation of returns, statistics, etc. in addition to the usual work of cyphering and decyphering. THE RECORD KEEPER AND HIS ASSISTANT registers and puts up all receipts with their relevant papers files all papers after action has been taken, closes and opens files when necessary and attends to theri binding and indexing. 9 THE STENOGRAPHER does the usual work of a stenographer. THE DESPATCHER attends to the despatch and collection of all mails (postal and safe hand) collects and delivers them in person. This takes time because the Residency is some three miles from the Post Office, the Agency, the Stemship Company's Office and the B.O.f.C. Office. Safe hand mail to and from London for the three Political Agencies is transmitted via the Residency. All the Clerks in the Confidential Office are trained as opportunity permits in all branches of work and are shifted freely from section to section. This is necessary not only to provide flexibility to deal with a rush of work in any particular section, but also to train men to hold posts in Agencies /here all tvpes of confidential work are performed by a single clerk.Telegrams dealt with in the Main Office are cl air or in non-confidential code and are generally brief.

We are anxious to push ahead as quickly as possible v;ith our plans for taking over the posts in the Persian Gulf and in South and East Persia. We are very much handicapped by our almost complete lack of knowledge of the establishment and organisation side of these posts about which we only know what you have kindly told us. In order to make plans for administering them as Foreign Service posts, v/e need a certain amount of information which we think can only be supplied by those on the spot. 3 . I have drawn up a short memorandum which v/e should now like to be sent as soon as possible to those posts we shall be taking over: i.e. Meshed, Khorramshahr, Bushifre (which as you know will become a Vice Consulate under the Foreign Office regime;, and the Agencies at Kuwait, Bahrein and Muscat. It may be tnat you would prefer to send the memorandum with enclosures to Hay m the first instance for those posts I^have mentioned except Meshed, since the Political Resident controls the Officer and Ministerial staff manning all the others. , a . ' ' 4. In regard to the Residency at Bahrein itself the establishment is of course a larger and more complicated proolem if only because the control of the quarantine organisation is carried'out from there. It would help us very much if Hay could give us the outline of the establishment there (in a^caaru form, if possible, as for the other places; and also the other particulars in respect of the Residency for which the memorandum asks. But we should appreciate additional infomaulon ±rom - 1 on matters common to the other posts as f 611 ; e.g. some idea oi how the various Ministerial officers rank in mieir o^/n heiira For instance I see in Hay’s letter i?0429/3 ofth ® 7 you he describes three different categories of officersjlndiar Political Service Officers, Ministerial Gazetoed Of-iceis „ cadre Ministerial staff. We have quite a clear idea 01 t . * * since recruitment for it has been conducted for many years xrom this country, but we are in the dark about the otaer two categories. For instance are the Ministerial stafi. an Ministerial Gazetted Officers divided into grades? .'/hat sort of people are they and how are they recruited? vVhat are oaeir prospects of promotion and at what age are they recruit d. they divided into grades and if so what sort oi 300 is uo y each grade and what is the salary, the incremental scale Gan v/e be given a rough idea of the ages ox the ^iJ-fer in their categories? _ Presumably the Ministerial Gazetted Officers are comparable to Warrant Officers or i..C. Services, but we do not know. Gan Hay give us some idea of trie different kinds of duties of the categories, and, of the categories of staff, what proportion would one ^pect to find in any ^iven set-up? Hay has given us the extracts Ox xinanciai terms of service in his letter under reference which was forwarded under cover of your letter 570/47 of the 20th March, what/ E.P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G. , India Office.2 . what we are anxious to have also is the background and the general conditions of service for these different categories of staff. We should also be grateful for a brief note from Hay regarding the pensionability of these categories, retiring ages, normal number of years’ service and how pension is calculated, whether allocation can be made to dependents etc.. Provided you see no objection, I should be grateful therefore if the memorandum with enclosures (referred to in para. 3 above) could be sent either to Bahrein for onward transmission or direct' personally to each of the posts in question asking them to supply all the information asked for by the memorandum as soon as possible. These, together with the information we hope Hay can supply as regards Bahrein itself and the general conditions of the service as a whole, will be most useful. . It may be that a certain number of queries will arise about which the South and East Persia posts could get elucidation from the Embassy at Tehran to.whom we are sending a copy of this letter with the enclosures. 6 . Turning now to the suggestion made by Hay that we should send out an officer to go into all these problems on the spot, we agree in principle that this is most desirable although we think it better first to have the replies from the posts to the enclosed memorandum and the information from Hay. If we get this information and can assemble and digest it here first, any officer we then send out will be able to make a much better job of it than a man sent out knowing nothing at all about the set up. Also he should be able to make much quicker progress if he has some idea of the ground to be covered before he leaves. 7. I am afraid I cannot at the moment answer any of Hay’s i ^ . mos -k unlikely that we should ' i k or indeed only exceptionally A 'I 'I 4- *4 ' work. All this depends on the relationship^^? In&amp;*e v wlth H.M.G. and whether or not she remains in the-commonwealthM All our pensionable appointments are confined to British subjects: whether Indians or Anglo- Indians will continue to be British subjects is something which will emerge at a later date. 8 . In return for Hay’s summary of the regulations for the I.P.S. in the Gulf we enclose herewith for his information 6 copies of the regulations for ’’Branch A” of the Foreign Service. I (The*term 'Branch A” is explained in the attached memorandum.) Regulations for 'Branch B' of the Foreign Service (i.e. the executive and clerical staff which we take to be similar to your Ministerial staff) are not yet ready but will follow closely the pattern of the Branch A regulations while being rather less generous on the whole. You will no doubt explain to Hay that these regulations are applicable only to the established members of the Service, i.e. to the career men who are entitled to a pension at the end of their service. 9. Since the above was drafted Y/e have had sig ht of yi letter Ext.973/47 of the 7th May, 1947^ to Garran,^in whid very useful information has been furnished by the Governme India. We shall study this carefully and should like to India. We shall study this carefully and should like to amendment s,if bb amendments to this which the Political Resident may send to the Government of India as requested hy them. At the same time the information for which we are now asking in the attached memorandum is complementary to that contained in the enclosure in your letter to Garran except for the salaries and names of people actually in post. I think, therefore, that the present letter and the attached memorandum can stand without duplicating, except in a very minor degree, the returns 'being made hy the Political Resident to the Government of India. Yours sincerely (T.J. 'Wilson). Vy-X ^■■MBEX MEMORANDUM 19 The Foreign Office will, in due course, have to take over certain posts previously administered hy the Government of India in the Persian Gulf and in South and East Persia. In order to do so we need all the information about these posts which the present occupants can most conveniently supply. (a) We should first like to have a clear picture of the present organisation of each post, which can best be done by a table of organisation, or ,, tree ,, , showing the position in the hierarchy at each post of every officer and employee and the lines of responsibility v/hich flow from the lowest paid employee to the Head of the Post. (A specimen is attached v/hich could probably be adapted to cover the various functions of a political agency). (b) Secondly we should like a short but complete account of the precise duties performed by each member appearing in the table of organisation including members of the I.P.S. or other similar Officer staff (this is what we mean by Branch 'A' staff), and saying how many hours a day he works at each of these duties. (c) Thirdly we should appreciate rough statistics showing the volume of work at each post over the last six months• (d) Fourthly v/e want to know which of those persons, including members of I.P.S. or other similar Officer staff (Branch 'A' staff) at present in post would be suitable or willing to stay on in Foreign Office employ after the change over. For this purpose we should like every member of the present Officer (i.e. Branch 'A”) or subordinate staffs to complete the attached form 'A 1 '. 2. The success of the arrangements for the change-over will very largely depend on the Heads of the different posts concerned. So little is known in the Foreign Office of these posts from an establishment and organisational angle that any recommendations or suggestions or additional information which the Head of the Post may offer in response to this memorandum v/ill be gratefully appreciated. 3 . It is anticipated that this preliminary enquiry v/ill raise a number of queries from the officers and employees themselves as to their own future. It should be emphasised that this memorandum is purely fact-finding and that no offers of employment, even tentative, can be made at this stage. We shall, however, be glad to know which of the persons now employed will be willing, in principle, to continue in the service of H.M.G.. It is not known how many such people will be needed in the long run nor what terms can be offered to them. They will have an opportunity in form u A n attached of indicating their willingness to continue in the Service. FOREIGN OFFICE, London. 12th May, 1947- 18. - ft. ' '*r,.

These increases will be subject to the production of a certifi cate that the sums claimed have been expended for the purposes laid down, and will be limited to three occasions during an officer s career. 6 .

A foreign allowance, or in the case of Heads of Diplomatic Missions frais de representation, will be assigned to officers serving abroad.. Comment. (1) Salary is intended to cover necessary expenditure in the United Kingdom and to take the first strain of the cost of living of the officer abroad, foreign allowances supplementing it to the extent to which the salary falls short of total necessary expenditure. In assessing foreign allowances, the following items inter alia are taken into account: (a) local cost of living; ( 6 ) expenditure which an officer serving abroad necessarily incurs, either at home or abroad, over and above that of an officer of corresponding grade ser ving in the Foreign Office; and (c) representational expenditure, i.e., expenditure which, while optional for a private individual, is obligatory for a member of the Foreign Service resident abroad by virtue of his official position. (2) In the case of officers who were formerly members of the Consular Service or of the Commercial Diplomatic Service, foreign allowance replaces repre sentation allowance, local allowance and any other cost-of-living allowance. (3) Foreign allowance is not subject to United Kingdom income tax. 2. The amount of the foreign allowance to be assigned to an officer will be determined by the Secretary of State in the light of the conditions at the particular post. 3. When an officer to whom a foreign allowance is assigned is absent from his post abroad, such allowance will be paid on the following basis: — A. —Officer returning to his Post. 4. When the officer is married and takes his wife and family (if any) with him and is— (i) On Duty. (a) In the United Kingdom. He will retain the allowance of his post and draw subsistence allowance for himself only at the rates in force for the United Kingdom. The position will be reviewed after two months’ absence. Comment. The officer will be responsible for the travelling expenses of his wife and family.2 (()) Elsewhere. He will retain his allowance and draw subsistence allowance for himself and also for his wife if approval is given for her to accompany him officially. (ii) On Earned Leave. He will draw no subsistence allowance but will retain his allowance except in the case of posts where the allowance is abnormally high, i.e., where it exceeds 100 per cent, of the mean of the salary scale of the officer’s grade. In such cases the allowance will be subject to a reduction at the rate of *25 per cent, of the total allowance as from the date of departure on leave. This reduction shall not operate so as to bring the allowance below the mean of the salary scale. This reduction will not be applied in respect of brief absences within a total of 14 days in one calendar year. (iii) On Sick Leave Ovtside the Conyitry where he is Posted. His earned leave allowance (see paragraph 4 (ii) above) will be reduced, as from the date of departure on sick leave, by 25 per cent, for such period as the Secretary of State considers reasonable in the circumstances. Comment. A married officer on sick leave outside the country where he is posted, who is due to return to his post, may thus incur a double cut in his foreign allowance. 5. \\ hen the officer is married and leaves his wife and family (if any) at the post and is— (i) On Duty. (a) In the United Kingdom. He will retain the allowance of his post and draw subsistence allowance. (h) Temporarily attached to another post. He will retain the whole of the allowance of his own post or draw that of the temporary post, whichever is higher, with sub sistence allowance in addition at the discretion of the Secretary of State. (c) On duty in circumstances other than (a) and (b). He will retain the allowance of his post and draw subsistence allowance. (ii) On Earned Leave. Wherever he is on earned leave he will retain the allowance of his post but will draw no subsistence allowance. (iii) On Sick Leave Outside the Country where he is Posted. Any such case which may arise will be dealt with on its merits.« r 3 6 . When the officer is unmarried and is— (i) On Duty. (a) In the United Kingdom. He will be eligible for subsistence allowance and will retain, for the period of one month, the allowance of his post. 1 hereafter, the allowance will be subject to a reduction at the rate of 50 per cent, of the total allowance provided that this reduction shall not bring the amount of the allowance below the minimum of his salary scale. (b) Temporarily attached to another post. He will retain the whole of the allowance of his own post or draw that of the temporary post, whichever is higher, with sub sistence allowance in addition at the discretion of the Secretary //N of State. (c) On duty in circumstances other than those in (a) and (b). He will retain the allowance of his post and draw subsistence allowance. (ii) On Earned Leave. Wherever his leave may be taken and whatever the allowance of his post may be, the unmarried officer’s allowance will be subject to a reduction at the rate of 50 per cent, of the total allowance as from the date of departure on leave provided that this reduction shall not bring the amount of the allowance below the minimum of his salary scale and that this reduction shall not be applied in respect of brief absences within a total of 14 days in one calendar year. (iii) On Sick Leave Outside the Country where Posted. His earned leave allowance (see paragraph 6 (ii)J will be reduced, as from the date of departure on sick leave, by 25 per cent, for such period as the Secretary of State considers reasonable in the circumstances. Comment. An unmarried officer on sick leave outside the country where he is posted, who is due to return to his post, may thus incur a double cut in his foreign allowance. B .—Officer not returning to his Post. 7 . When the officer is married and takes his wife and family (if any) with him and is— (i) On Temporary Duty. (a) In the United Kingdom. He will drop his foreign allowance and receive a taxable allowance at the following annual rates: — Grade 4 (officer other than Head of Mission) Grade 5 Grade 6 Grade 7 Grades 8 and 9 (reg. 4.) £ 445 380 450 420 170(b) At another post. He will receive the allowance of that post. (ii) On Earned Leave. He will receive the allowance described in paragraph 7 (i) (a', above. (hi) On Sick Leave in the United Kingdom.

An officer, married or unmarried, who is on sick leave in the country where he is posted will retain his allowance in full for twx) months, thereafter the allowance will be reduced by 25 per cent, for such period as the Secretary of State considers reasonable in the circumstances. 11. Subject to a deduction equivalent to the additional allowance for entertainment to be granted to the Charge d’Affaires, as provided in paragraph 12 of this Regulation, the Head of a Diplomatic Mission will continue to receive his frais in full during absences on authorised leave or on duty on the condition that he continues to defray the expenses of the upkeep of the Mission during his absence. On the expiry of his authorised leave, if he is still absent from his post, the extent of any further deduction will be determined by the Secretary of State. 12 . When an officer acts as Charge d Affaires at a Diplomatic Mission during the absence of the Head of the Mission, he will draw, in addition to his own foreign allowance, an allowance at rates laid down from time to time to enable him to meet the additional cost of entertainment.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 5 HOME SERVICE ALLOWANCES 1 . Home Service allowances will be payable to members of certain grades of Branch A of the Foreign Service appointed for duty at the Foreign Office after service abroad. They comprise four elements: — (i) A transfer grant, payable on transfer from a post abroad to a post at home. (ii) An annual allowance to provide for necessary entertain ment for official purposes. (hi) An annual allowance towards special expenditure on rent and representation necessarily arising in connexion with an officer’s position as a member of the Foreign Service. (iv) An annual allowance designed to assist officers to meet extra expenditure resulting from special conditions in the Foreign Service in connexion with the education of their children. Transfer Grant. 2. This grant, which will not be liable to Income Tax, will be of an amount equivalent to one-tenth of the mean of the officer’s salary scale. It will be payable to members of Branch A of the Foreign Service on appointment for duty at home after service abroad. Comment. Where transfer is accompanied by promotion, this amount will be calculated on the new salary. Entertainment Allowance. 3. This annual allowance, which will also not be liable^ to Income Tax, will be payable to members of Grades 4, 5, 6 , 7, 8 and 9, during service at home after duty abroad. The amount of the allowance will vary according to the officer’s grade and according to whether he is married or single, as shown in the following table: — Grade 4 Grade 5 Grade 6 Grade 7 Grades 8 and 9 Married. £. 200 175 175 125 50 Single. £. 100 90 90 65 30Rent and Representation Allowance. 4 . This annual allowance, which will be liable to Income Tax, will be payable to members of Grades 5, 6 , 7, 8 and 9 during service at home after duty abroad. The amount of the allowance will vary according to the officer’s grade (and, m the case ox Grade G, 'his salary) and according to whether he is married or single, as shown in the following table : Married. Single. £. £. Grade 5 50 20 Grade G— Salaries— £1,700 50 20 £l,G00-£1,699 ... 85 35 £l,500-£1.599 ... 120 55 £1.400-£ 1,499 ... 150 70 £l,300-£1,399 ... 180 85 £l,200-£1,299 ... 210 100 Grade 7 210 100 Grades 8 and 9 ... 85 35 Education Allowance. 5. These annual allowances will be payable to members Grades 5, G, 7, 8 and 9 who are appointed from abroad for duty at home and are designed to assist those who, because of the special circumstances of their employment as members of the Foreign Service, have found it necessary to send their children to boarding schools in this country. They will be subject to Income Tax and will be payable in respect of the excess over a standard figure, representing an average normal cost of bringing up and educating a child, of the cost of boarding school education. The maximum allowance payable will be £150 for each child, and the scheme will ordinarily apply to cases where not more than two children are necessarily being educated at boarding- schools. G. The period during which these allowances will be payable to any individual will be limited to a maximum of five years, before the expiry of which an officer may ordinarily expect to have again been posted abroad.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. G LEAVE The following Regulation applies to members of Branch A of the Foreign Service: — I.—Ordinary Leave 1. Permission to take ordinary leave can only be granted subject to the exigencies of the Service. 2 . — (a) Members of the Service can take the ordinary leave for which they are eligible under this regulation only with the permission: — (i) in the case of persons serving at a post abroad, of the Secretary of State and, where-applicable, of the Head of the post or of the superintending post or, in the case of superintending consular officers, of the Head of the Mission ; (ii) in the case of an Assistant Under-Secretary of State or of the Head of a Department in the Foreign Office, of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State or of the Superintending Under-Secretary of State as the case may be ; (iii) in the case of other officers serving in United Kingdom, of the Head of the Department in which they are serving. ( 6 ) Applications for leave from Heads of posts should state the name of the officer to be left in charge. 3. In calculating the number of days of ordinary leave to which an officer is eligible at any time: — (a) Sundays, occurring during a period when leave is being taken, are counted ; (b) the remainder of the calendar year in which leave is taken may, if the officer so desires, be included in the computation ; (c) if an officer falls sick while on ordinary leave or during travelling time under paragraph 11 below and furnishes a medical certificate to that effect, the period of sickness will be regarded as sick leave. 4. Officers serving in the United Kingdom are eligible for the amount of ordinary leave prescribed in paragraph 6 . 5. Except where otherwise stated, paragraphs 6 to 11 apply only to officers serving abroad.6 . Members of Branch A of the Foreign Service are eligible for ordinary leave at the rate of 4'2 days per annum during t id first ten years of their service and 56 days per annum thereafter, together with any additional leave for which they may be eligible under paragraph 7 of this regulation. Comment: — An officer taking leave in respect of a period of service for which only a part falls within his first ten years, is eligible for leave at the rate of 42 days per annum in respect of that part and at the rate of 56 days per annum for the remainder of the period. 7. Officers who are stationed at certain posts or in certain countries, which shall from time to time be specified by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury as unhealthy for purposes of leave of absence, and who, at the expiration of their leave, return to the same post or any other of the specified posts, are eligible for additional ordinary leave at the rate of 14 days per annum, with a maximum accumulation of 28 days. 8 . Subject to the limitations of paragraph 10 below, ordinary leave may be taken: — (a) in the country wdiere the officer is serving or in another country; (b) in one period during the calendar year covering all the leave for which the officer is eligible in that year; (c) in more than one period during the calendar year; (d) by accumulating the leave to which the officer is entitled (or any part thereof) over a period of more than one year. Comment: — Officers passing through the United Kingdom on transfer will normally be required to take any leave for which they are then eligible. 9. Where an officer has spent sick leave in the United Kingdom, he should take any ordinary leave for which he is eligible at the time his sick leave terminates before he returns to his post abroad, unless the Secretary of State decides otherwise. 10. The following rules are applicable to accumulated leave : — (a) No officer of less than ten years’ service can accumulate more than 126 days ordinary leave and no other officer more than 168 days ordinary leave. These limits of 126 and 168 days respectively are increased by 28 days in the case of officers serving at the posts or in the countries referred to in paragraph 7 of this regulation.3 (reg. 6.) (b) An officer who has accumulated ordinary leave must, on the next occasion when he is granted travelling time for the purpose of proceeding on leave, take all the accumulated leave to which he. is then entitled. (c) Save in exceptional circumstances and with the express permission of the Secretary of State, no leave may be accumulated in respect of service in the United Kingdom. 11. Travelling time (i.e., the time occupied by the outward and return journey by an approved route between the country where the officer is serving and the country where he is taking his leave) is allowed on one occasion in respect of each calendar year in addition to the periods of ordinary leave under the previous paragraphs of this regulation with the proviso that travelling time thus allowed shall not exceed the time occupied by a journey to and from the United Kingdom by an approved route. Comment: — For the conditions on which travelling allowances are granted, see Regulation No. 7. II.—Sick Leave 12. Unless otherwise stated, the following paragraphs of this regulation apply to members of the Service whether they are serving in the United Kingdom or abroad. 18. The grant of sick leave is subject in all cases to the Secretary of State being satisfied that the officer to whom it is granted has a reasonable prospect of recovery so as to enable him to return to his duties. 14. The grant of sick leave to any officer for a period exceeding four days is conditional on the production by the officer of a certificate by a duly qualified medical practitioner indicating the nature of the illness and the period estimated to be required for recovery. If the number of days during which any officer is absent on sick leave in any period of twelve months without such ^ certificate shall exceed seven in the aggregate, the number of days of absence in excess of seven shall be deducted from the amount of ordinary leave allowable. 15. The permissions required for the grant of sick leave are the same as those described in paragraph 2 of this Regulation. In the case of officers serving abroad, no reference need be made to the Foreign Office for any period of sick leave not exceeding 14 days . 16. The Secretary of State may require further medical certificates or periodical medical certificates reporting progress where he considers it desirable.17. Sick leave on full pay may be granted for a period or periods not exceeding six months in the aggregate during any period of twelve months. An officer who has had sick leave on full pay for the maximum period may be granted sick leave on half pay, subject always to a maximum of twelve months’ sick leave (whether on whole or half pay) in any period of four years. Comment: — Sick leave for periods not exceeding four days covered by a medical certificate (see paragraphs 14 and 15) are counted for the purpose of the application of paragraph 17 above. 18. Where an officer has been granted the maximum amount of sick leave which can be granted on full or half pay, the grant of further sick leave will be conditional on the receipt by the Secretary of State of a reliable medical certificate showing that the officer is considered likely to be able to resume his duties within a reasonable period. If further sick leave is granted, the officer may be paid a salary at the rate not exceeding the amount of pension (if any) for which he would have been qualified if he had retired for reasons of health at the time when his period of sick leave expired (hereafter referred to as pension rate of pay); or on half pay if this would be less than pension rate of pay. If the officer is unable to furnish a medical certificate as described above his retirement from the Service on grounds of ill-health will have to be considered. Comment: — (1) Sick leave in excess of twelve months during any period of four years will not qualify for annual increments of salary, or for pension on retirement. ( 2 ) See paragraph 9 of this Regulation as to the taking of accrued ordinary leave at the end of sick leave in the case of an officer serving abroad. (3) See paragraph 3 (c) of this Regulation as regards officers falling sick during their ordinary leave. III.—Leave (General) 19. Every officer serving abroad must inform the Personnel Department, in advance if possible, of the date on which he intends to proceed on ordinary, sick or special leave, and of the address to which he is goihg. Every subsequent change of address must be reported to that Department. 20 . Every officer serving abroad must inform the Personnel Department in advance of the date on which he intends to leave the United Kingdom in order to return to his post from leave.w Mi' and 2 on l!!v aCfc T 1 ° f eVery officer ’ s departure from his post F 1 , l nZ a S d ° t 1 hlS return must be officially reported to the in ffi :^ r y c t a t gram in the onse 0f hea&lt;iS ° £ ^ ,npnLl When r irCUr T tanCeS permit &gt; officers wm be expected to spend their ordinary leave in the United Kingdom in order that ^iey may keep m touch with developments in this country.

This regulation applies exclusively to members of Branch A of the Service. 2. Whenever an officer makes a journey on public Service, the amount of the fares by rail, ship, aircraft or motor car, as the case may be, for the journey in question by the approved route will be payable to him. Comment. The “ approved route ” means the route approved for the particular journey in question. In many cases there is a standard route for journeys between different countries /''“n which will be the “ approved route.” An officer who makes the journey by a route other than the approved route (e.g., travels by air or in his own car when the approved route is by rail, &amp;c.) will not be able to claim more than the amount payable for a journey by the approved route. On the other hand* if the route which he takes is cheaper than the approved route he will not be able to claim more than the actual expenses incurred. 3. Journeys on the public Service include: — (a) Any journey made by an officer serving at home or abroad for the purpose of attending an international conference or dis cussion or consultation, or of making a tour or visit, which the officer makes with the authority of the Secretary of State. Comment. The Secretary of State may delegate to the Head of a Diplomatic Mission authority to sanction journeys by members of the Service in the territories within his jurisdiction. (b) Any journey from the United Kingdom made by an officer to his post abroad on his appointment to such post. (c) Any journey to his new post made by an officer on transfer from the place where the officer was previously serving or, if he was on leave at the time of transfer, from the place where he was spending his leave. If, however, the journey from the place where he was spending his leave is more expensive than the journey from his previous post, the officer will not be able to claim more than the amount payable in respect of a journey from the United Kingdom or from his previous post as the Secretary of State may decide. (d) Where the journey in the cases referred to in (b) and (c) above is made by an officer who is being moved at his own request before the completion of 3 years’ service at his post or by an officer who is being moved on account of misconduct, the officer would not be entitled to be repaid the cost of his travelling expenses.2 4. The amount of the fares by rail, ship, aircraft or motor car, as the case may be, by an approved route, will be payable to an officer serving abroad: — (а) If he is proceeding from or returning to his post during ordinary leave, in the cases specified in paragraph 5 below. ( б ) If he is proceeding from or returning to his post during sick leave, in the cases specified in paragraph 6 below. (c) If he is retiring on pension and is proceeding from his post to his place of retirement. If the journey to the place of Ins retirement is a more expensive journey than a journey to the United Kingdom, the officer will not be entitled to claim more than would be payable in respect of the journey to the United Kingdom. (d) An officer who retires in circumstances where he is not-^ granted a pension (t.e., at his own request or for misconduct) may not claim any travelling allowances on retirement.. 5. An officer will only be entitled to receive the amount of fares in the cases referred to in paragraph 4 (a) above (ordinary leave) after 24 months’ service at his post or, in the case of officers serving at certain posts or in certain countries which are regarded as unhealthy for purposes of leave, after 18 months service. Where leave is taken in a country other than the United Kingdom, the amounts payable in respect of fares will not usually be paid from public funds and will only be allowed if the Secretary of State decides that payment from public funds is warranted by the special circumstances of the case and, in any case, will not exceed those which would be payable in respect of a journey to of from the United Kingdom by an approved route. If, how ever, the amount of the fares to or from the place at which leave is being taken is less than the amount of the fares for a journey to the United Kingdom, the officer will not receive more than the amount of the fares for the journey actually taken. Comment. An officer who receives travelling expenses for the purpose of proceeding on leave to the United Kingdom may ^ be required during his stay to visit industrial areas, to'^ study aspects of the national life on which it is his duty to be informed, or to consult with Government Departments. Any time so spent will be additional to authorised leave. 6 . In the cases referred to in paragraph 4 (b) above (sick leave), the Secretary of State may at his discretion allow the payment to the officer of the amount of the fares from his post to such place as the officer may proceed under medical advice on health grounds or for the purposes of undergoing treatment which is not available locally.3 Comment. The Secretary of State will require, before sanctioning the payment of the amount of fares under the above para graph, the production of a certificate by a duly qualified medical practitioner that it is necessary for the officer to proceed to the place to which the journey is made on health grounds. 7.—(a) An officer who is making a journey in any of the cases referred to in (b) or (c) of paragraph 3 or in (a) or (c) of para graph 4 above will be entitled to receive the amount of the fares by the approved route for members of his family, as defined in paragraph (b) below. In the cases referred to in (a) of paragraph 3 • and (b) of paragraph 4 he will only be entitled to receive the amounts of the fares for any members of his family if the Secretary of State in any particular case so decides. Comment. ( 1 ) Families will be expected to travel together. Where the officer’s family do not travel with him their expenses will not be paid unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that there was a good reason for separate journeys. (2) Travelling expenses will be allowed for an officer’s wife in cases under (a) of paragraph 3 only where the Secre tary of State has been satisfied in advance that it was necessary or desirable for her to accompany the officer. (3) Where, for the reasons givep in paragraphs 3 (d) and 4 (d), the officer is not entitled to receive the amount of the fares for himself, he will not be able to claim them for his family. (b) The members of an officer’s family referred to in (a) above are— (i) his wife, or if he is unmarried or a widower and is not living in an hotel, a sister or other relative who lives with him and acts as his hostess; (ii) sons who at the time of the commencement of the journey are under 16 years of age, or who. though 16 years of age or over, reside with and are dependent on their father by reason of physical or mental infirmity; (iii) unmarried daughters residing with and dependent on their father; (iv) sons up to the age of 18 vears who are resident at their father’s post abroad and are receiving full-time educa tion at that post. Comment. Adopted or step-sons or daughters are included in the above enumeration. (c) The amount of the fares of the members of the family of an officer serving abroad who dies, leaving his family abroad, for a journey from the place where they are to go, will be paid at the (reg. 7.)vpouest of his widow or other member of his family up to the amount of the fares from the officer’s post to the United Kingdom. (d) If a member of the family of an officer serving abroad who is resident with the officer at his post 'K 3 *™™^ ™* ** required to proceed elsewhere on health grounds or for the purposes of^treatment, the Secretary of State may, at his discretion, allow payment to the officer of the return fares of the sick person a (where necessary) another person travelling with the sick perso , Cm ?he officer's post to such place as the sick person may pro- ceed on medical advice. The comment to paragraph G above applies here. 8 (a) An officer who is making a journey in any of the ca f e ® referred to in ( 6 ) or (c) of paragraph 3 or (a) - (&lt;=&gt; oi Pf above will be entitled to receive the amount of the tares b the approved route for servants (within the limits specified m paragraph (b) below). The Secretary of State may m special XLtancU authorise the payment of the tees 0 a se * accompanving the officer in the cases referred to in (b) ot para graph? (provided no member of the family is also accompanying the officer) and (a) of paragaph 3 above. (b) The maximum number of servants in respect of whom the amounts of fares may be paid are Heads of Missions: 5; , , T t j * Married officers in Grades 4, 5 and 6 (other than Heads of Missions): 3; . . „ Married officers in Grades 7 to 9, and unmarried officers m Grades 4, 5, 6 : 2; Other officers: 1; except that in the cases referred to in (a) of paragraph 4 (ordinary leave) the maximum number of servants is Heads of Missions: 3; „ , ^ ts a Grades 4 to 6 (other than Heads of Married officers in Missions): 2; Other officers: 1. i n / W) 'YV! PllT Comments (1) and (2) to paragraph the case of servants. (a) above also apply to (c) Where an officer serving abroad dies, leaving at his post servants whom he had brought from the United Kingdom or elsewhere to his post and for whose return to their homes he had made himself responsible, the amount of the fares for such servants (within the limits of (b) above) for a journey from his post to their homes will be paid on request up to the amount of the fares to the United Kingdom. 9 . Where the amounts of fares are payable under the previous paragraphs of this Regulation, these fares will be (a) in the caseof the officer or members of his family, first-class fares, including sleeping berths, for a land journey, (b) in the case of servants, third-class fares in the United Kingdom and second-class fares elsewhere. Where, however,'the servant is a nurse or governess travelling with the officer’s child or children of 10 years of age or under, a first-class fare will be paid. (This does not apply to a journey or part of a journey by land where (a) there is only one such child, or ( 6 ) first-class sleeping accommodation is obtainable on payment of a supplement to a second-class fare, in which case this supplement will be payable.) First-class fares will, however, be payable in respect of servants in cases where no second-class accommodation is available, or, in exceptional cases abroad, where the Secretary of State is satisfied that second-class accommoda tion is unsuitable for Europeans. 10. —(a) In any case where the amount of fares is payable under the preceding paragraphs of this regulation, except in the case of journeys on ordinary and sick leave, a subsistence allow ance will be granted to meet the expenses of food and sleeping accommodation, where these are not included in the fare. The subsistence allowance will be at the rate in force at the time for the countries traversed by the approved route or for journeys by sea. ( 6 ) Full subsistence allowance will be payable in respect of the officer himself, three-quarters of the full allowance for his wife, one-half of the full allowance for every other member of his family above the age of 12 months, and three-eighths of the full allowance for servants, subject to the limitation as to numbers laid down in paragraphs 7 (b) and 8 (b) of this Regulation. (c) Where some, but not all, of the items for which subsistence allowance is granted are provided under the fare, the subsistence allowance will be proportionately reduced. Comment. (1) If an officer is allowed the expenses of a sleeping berth on a long journey, he will receive only tw r o-thirds of the subsistence allowance to meet the cost of his food. (2) Subsistence allowances are payable only in cases where fares are payable or if the expenses which the allowance is designed to meet are not covered by the payment of a fare. Consequently, they are payable, inter alia, in the cases in 7 (c) or 8 (c), but not in cases under 8 (d) or 4 (d). (3) See the comment to paragraph 2 above. 11. Necessary expenses (such as taxi fares, fees for registra tion of luggage, porterage, &amp;c.) incidental to the journey in respect of wdiich the amount of the fare is payable under the preceding paragraphs of this regulation will be payable to the officer on his application.6 Comment. (1) Only incidental expenses which are reasonably neces sary will be payable under this paragraph and the officer will be required to certify that the expenses which he claims were necessarily incurred. (2) . The comment to paragraph 2 above and comment (1) and (3) to paragraph 7 above apply to claims to these expenses. 12 . Where an officer is proceeding to his post on transfer or on first appointment abroad or leaving his post on retirement on pension or on an appointment to the United Kingdom, or when an officer dies while serving abroad, the cost of transporting his personal effects by an approved route and method of transport will be allowed up to such amount as the Secretary of State may ^ consider to be reasonable, except in the circumstances indicated in paragraphs 3 (d) and 4 (d). Comment. (1) This paragraph applies to heavy luggage containing per sonal effects as opposed to ordinary travelling luggage, which goes under paragraph 11 above, and the furniture which is dealt with in paragraph 13 below. It includes such things as clothes, household linen, books and small articles of decoration. The cost of transporting heavy articles such as pianos, radiograms and large gramo^- phones would not be allowed under this head. As regards the transport of motor cars, see paragraph 16. (2) Comments ( 1 ) and (3) to paragraph 7 above also apply here. 13. (a) Where an officer is appointed or transferred to a post and has been authorised by the Secretary of State to rent unfurnished accommodation, the cost of transporting the officer’s own furniture by an approved route and method of transport to ' his post will be allowed, but only within the following limits: (i) In the case of unmarried officers below Grade 6 up to 4 tons, or 800 cubic feet, or 23 cubic metres. (ii) In the case of married or unmarried officers of Grades 1 r* to 6 , and married officers of lower grades, up to 10 £ tons, or 2,100 cubic feet, or 60 cubic metres. Comment. (1) The limits specified in (ii) above are the equivalent of about three van loads. (2) In order to ensure that claims for the cost of trans porting furniture are as low as possible, officers should, v henever possible, obtain three competitive tenders for transport, including insurance of the risk against damage in transport. (b) Where an officer is allowed the cost of transporting his furniture under (a) above but cannot immediately find suitable iunfurnished accommodation at his new po5t, he will be allowed storage charges for furniture up to the limits specified in (a) above, for a reasonable period. Comment. The storage under (b) may be at his new post or his old post. The period allowed will not ordinarily exceed B months. (c) Where an officer has been given a rent allowance for furnished accommodation or where his official residence, though furnished, has not been completely equipped, he will be allowed the cost of transporting by an approved route and method* of transport any essential articles of furniture which are not included in the furniture provided. (d) Where an officer is leaving his post on retirement on pen sion or on appointment to the United Kingdom, or when an officer serving abroad dies, the cost of transporting his furniture to the United Kingdom or place of retirement by an approved route and method of transport will be allowed up to the limits as to quantity specified in (a) above, and up to the limits as to cost of the trans port to London. (e) Where the officer is being moved in the circumstances indicated in paragraphs 3 (d) and 4 (d), no allowances can be claimed under this paragraph. 14. Where an officer serving abroad is, at the time of his transfer to a new appointment, in possession of furniture at his old post and is not granted an allowance for transferring his furni ture to his new post under paragraph 13 (a) above, the officer will, at his option, be allowed (unless the transfer is made in the circumstances indicated in paragraphs 3 (d) or 4 (d)) either the cost of removing the furniture to London up to the limits of the quantity of furniture specified in 13 (a), or the cost of storing the furniture up to these limits as to quantity, and up to the limits as to cost of the transport of the furniture to London. Comment. If the officer is subsequently transferred to another post abroad in circumstances where he may be allowed the cost of removing his furniture to this post, he is then eligible to apply for the cost of removing his furniture under paragraph 13 (a) from London or the place abroad where he stored it, as the case may be. If he retires on pension or dies and his furniture has been stored abroad under paragraph 14, application may be made for the cost of removing his furniture to London under para graph 13 (d). 15. —(a) Where an allowance is granted for the purpose of removing furniture under paragraphs 13 (a) or (d) or 14. or of removing essential articles of furniture under paragraph 13 (c) or of removing heavy luggage under paragraph 12 , the reasonable8 cost of insuring during transit will also be allowed up to 'the limits specified in ( 6 ) below. Comment. Only the premium to cover the additional risks on removal will be allowed. No allowance for insurance will be given in so far as the risk is covered by the contract of removal and therefore covered by the allowances for removal. ( 6 ) The limits referred to in (a) of this paragraph are: — (i) Where an allowance for the removal of furniture has been given, under paragraph 18 (a). The total value of all insured property shall not exceed— £ In the case of the Head of a Mission In the case of Officers in Grades 4, 5 and 6 (other than Heads of Missions) ... In the case of other married officers ... In the case of other unmarried officers 5,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 (ii) Where an allowance for the removal of essential articles of furniture has been given, under paragraph 13 (c).

Where an officer is appointed or transferred to a post at which it is necessary for the proper execution of his duties that he should have his own private motor car and where the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is not possible for the officer to purchase a car locally on reasonable conditions, the cost of transporting a car from the United Kingdom or from his previous post by an approved route and method of transport will be allowed. Comment. The motor car need not be included within the limits as regards weight and cubic capacity specified in para graph 13 above.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 8 i RENT ALLOWANCES 1. A member of Branch A of the Foreign Service serving abroad at a post at which a furnished residence is not provided, will receive a rent allowance sufficient, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, to enable him to defray the cost of renting suitable furnished accommodation, excluding services and other tenant’s charges. Alternatively, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, an officer may be provided with a rent allowance sufficient to enable him to defray the cost of renting suitable unfurnished accommodation, excluding services and other tenant’s charges, where, under the provisions and within the limits of paragraph 18 (a) of Regulation No. 7, he is entitled to claim the cost of transporting his own furniture to his post. Comment : — The Ministry of Works Regulations regarding Government property will apply in all cases where Government furniture is provided. No charge will be made for the use of Government furniture. 2. The rent allowance becomes payable from the date when an officer arrives at his post unless he is granted a subsistence allowance, in which case it becomes payable when this allowance terminates. Subject to paragraph 4 below, rent allowance ceases to be payable on the day on which the officer leaves his post on termination of his appointment. 8 . An officer who is unable to find suitable accommodation immediately on arrival at his new post may be allowed to claim, in lieu of foreign and rent allowances, subsistence allowance for himself and for each member of his family (including servants) for whom fares are payable from public funds, for a period not normally exceeding 28 days and at the rates specified in para graph 10 of Regulation No. 7. 4. Where an officer who has been granted a rent allowance is transferred to another post otherwise than at his own request and can show that he has been unable to dispose of the lease of his residence, he will be allowed to claim, as compensation for the rent for which he is liable, a sum which shall not exceed the rent allowance previously granted to him, for a period which will be determined by the Secretary of State but which will not exceed three months except in special cases.5. An officer who has been granted a rent allowance may receive that allowance during the periods of authorised absence if the Secretary of State is satisfied that he has not been able to sub-let. &gt; Conmient : — Officers who rent accommodation must furnish a certificate from the Head of the Diplomatic Mission or the Superintending consular officer—as the case may b e —that they have made the most economical arrange ments consistent with their rank and requirements. They must themselves defray any additiohal expenditure on rent which may be caused by maintaining larger or more expensive establishments than are necessary. They must also endeavour to obtain a clause (known as a “ diplo matic clause ”) in the lease enabling them to terminate it at short notice in the event of transfer before its expiry. r'\ -FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 9 LANGUAGE ALLOWANCES 1. A language allowance of £100 a year (taxable) will be ^ &gt;a ^ 1 a ) j. ,° an y officer of Branch A of the Foreign Service of the rank of Grade 6 or below (i.e., of the rank of Counsellor, Consul- general or below) who is certified by the Civil Service Commission ° av e passed an examination in and to possess a competent mowledge, colloquial and otherwise, for ordinary purposes, of any ot the following languages: — Chinese. Japanese Bulgarian. Czecho-Slovak. Finnish. Class I. Siamese. Amharic. Class II. Hungarian. Modern Greek. Polish. Arabic. Persian. Russian. Serbo-Croatian. Turkish. 2 . The allowance may be increased to £200 a year (taxable) to officers who acquire a high standard of proficiency, sufficient to enable them to act as interpreters, in any of the languages in Class I. o o Comment : — (1) Members of Branch A of the Foreign Service will be expected, wherever possible, to learn the language of the country in which they are posted. ( 2 ) Candidates for any of the allowances specified in this Regulation will normally be required to pay their own teachers’ fees, except in the case of those officers who on first appointment abroad are instructed to devote themselves primarily to acquiring a thorough knowledge of Chinese, Japanese, Siamese, Persian, Russian, Arabic, Turkish or Amharic. (3) Officers who learn a language (other than French) for which no annual allowance is payable, may be allowed teachers’ fees on a reasonable scale. 3. Language allowances will be payable only while the officer holds a post in a country where the language for which he has been granted an allowance is in current use. i Comment : — Not more than one such allowance will be payable under the provisions of this paragraph.FOKEIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 10 TRANSFERS AND PROMOTIONS ^ I ins regulation applies to members of Rranch A of the Foreign Service. 1. In rega,rd to all appointments whatever in the Service, the Secretary of State will be free to make any such selection as, on his own responsibility, he may deem right without being bound ^ by claims founded on seniority or on membership of the Service. Comments. (1) The Secretary of State is not bound by the recom mendations referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 below. ( 2 ) In accordance with Article 5 (3) of the Foreign Service Order in Council, 1943, the secondment or appoint ment of Foreign Service officers to posts outside the loreign Service will not be excluded when it can be shown to be useful to the public service. 2 . All members of the Service, whether married or unmarried, must be prepared to go to any post at which their services may be required. Comment. When appointments and transfers are made account will be taken, so far as possible, of the circumstances and wishes of the individual; members of the Service will, however, be expected, save in exceptional circumstances, to regard an intimation that they are to be transferred to a certain post as an order and not as a request. Recommendations for transfers and promotions in or to grade 6 or higher grades will be made to the Secretary of State by the Promotions Board. Comment. The Promotions Board will be convened by the Permanent Under-Secretary as and when he considers it desirable for the purpose of advising the Secretary of State on appointments to higher posts in the Service as well as on other administrative or disciplinary questions. The Board will sit under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State and will ordinarily consist ofthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the Deputy and Assistant Under-Secretaries of State, the head of the Personnel Department, and the Principal Private Secretary to the Secretary of State. The President of the Board of Trade will be represented when appropriate. 4. Recommendations for transfers and promotions in 01 to grades 7, 8 and 9 of Branch A will be made by the Personnel Department in consultation with the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State and the head of Department and Under secretary concerned. These recommendations will be subject to the approval of the Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Administration.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 11 DISCIPLINARY QUESTIONS 1 .—(^i) This Regulation appiies to all cases where a member of the Service is accused of a disciplinary offence. It does not apply to cases where an officer is merely admonished. (ii) (a) In this Regulation the expression “disciplinary offence” means conduct by a member of the Service prejudicia to the interests of the Service or unbefitting the position which he holds in the Service, or disobedience of official instructions ol such a character that a warning or a reprimand with or without transfer to another post may be an appropriate penalty. ^ o/ &lt;b) In this Regulation a “ grave disciplinary offence means a disciplinary offence which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is of so serious a character that dismissal from the Service or a reduction in rank or a loss of seniority may be an appropriate penalty. Comment to paragraph 1 (ii) (a) and (bl it is not possible or desirable to attempt to lay down rules which determine in all circumstances what conduct constitutes a disciplinary offence or a grave disciplinary offence nor the penalty that would be appropriate. There are certain courses of conduct which are reprehensible whatever the rank of the member; in other cases conduct may be reprehensible if the member holds a high post, but less serious when the member is of junior status. There are also courses of conduct which may most appropriately be dealt with by the Head of the Post at which the officer is serving or b v the Head of the Personnel Department direct. The Report of the 25th February, 1938, of a Board of Enquiry appointed to investigate certain statements affecting civil servants are still fully applicable to members of the Foreign Service as a useful guide to their conduct. ( C ) “ Promotions Board ” means either the whole Board or a v N., i -R^ov/I coWfprl hv the Permanent Under-Secre- Any reference to a person holding any office includes a person who .s, with the authority of the Secretary of State, temporarily acting for the holder of that ofhee. •2. The expression “ official superior ” means in the case of : — (i) a member of the staff of a Diplomatic Mission abroad the Head of that Mission or a Foreign Service Inspector or,2 in the case of the Head of the Mission, a Foreign Service Inspector or a person charged by the Secretary ot State to investigate the matter; _ 1 (ii) a member of the staff of a Consulate, the senior Consular Officer of the district or a Foreign Service Inspector or, in the case of the senior Consular Officer of the district, the Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the country in which the Consulate is situated (if any) or a Foreign Service Inspector; liii) a person working in the Foreign Office, the superintending Under-Secretary of State for the Department in which the person is working or, where such person is no working in any particular Department or holds the rank of Under-Secretary of State, the Deputy Under-Secre tary of State for Administration. 3. The Secretary of State may suspend a member of toe Foreign Service from duty if the question whether he has been guilty of a disciplinary offence is raised and the Secretary of State considers that his suspension is desirable until the question has been investigated and a decision reached. Unless the Sccie- tary of State shall determine otherwise, the remuneration of an officer suspended from duty will cease from the date of his suspen sion. In the event of his reinstatement, it may, however, be restored wholly or in part should the Secretary of State so determine. 4. Complaints of disciplinary offences by a member of the Service shall be made by the official superior in a letter addressed to the Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Administration setting out the full facts of the case with any comments or explanations which the official superior feels it necessary to make. A copy of this letter shall be communicated to the person complained of either by the official superior or, if he has not done so, by the Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Administration. 5 . The member of the Service complained of may present his defence to the complaint made against him in a letter addressed to the Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Administration. The^v Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Administration may refer this letter to the official superior for his comments, and any comments received in reply from the official superior will be com municated to the person complained of in order that he may have an opportunity of making any further reply which he may think necessary. 6 . It is not desirable that the official superior should address any other communications about the case to the Deputy Under secretary of State for Administration or to any other person, but, should he do so, they will be treated in accordance with the pro cedure laid down in paragraph 4 above.o ('2ft?. (reg. 11.) i. If the disciplinary offence is an ordinary disciplinary offence and the person complained of does not dispute the facts, t, ie &lt; ^ ec ^ s ^ on as to the penalty to be imposed may be taken bv the Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Administration and com municated by him or by the Head of the Personnel Department to the person concerned. If the person complained of disputes the facts alleged against him or wishes to appeal against the penalty, the case shall be referred to a committee of the Promotions Board under the chairmanship of the Deputy Under-Secretary of State 01 Administration on which a legal adviser of the Foreign Office s mil sit if the Secretary of State so directs or if the person com- p &lt;uned of so requests. In this event the Board shall furnish to the Secretary of State in writing its opinion on the facts and as to what, if any, offence is proved (if the facts are in dispute), and its advice upon the penalty. If the disciplinary offence is a grave disciplinary offence, and the person complained of does not dispute the facts alleged against him, the case shall be sent to the Promotions Board to express their advice as to the penalty. This advice shall be furnished to the Secretary of State in writing. (n) If the person complained of disputes the facts alleged against him, his case shall be heard by a committee of the P/omotions Board composed as provided in paragraph 7 above, and the Board shall furnish to the Secretary of State in writing its opinion as to the facts and what offence (if any) is proved and its advice as to the penalty. In either case the decision of the Secretary of State shall be communicated to the person concerned by the Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Administration. 0. When any disciplinary offence is referred for consideration to the Promotions Board, all the letters relating to the offence referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 above shall be laid before the Board. The Board may summon any witnesses whom it con siders it desirable to hear, and the accused person shall have a right to be heard and subject to the consent of the Board to bring any witnesses whom he may desire. The accused person shall ^have the right to be present, when all other witnesses are giving ^ evidence. 10 . 'Ihe decision as to the penalty shall in all cases remain vested in the Secretary of State after he has considered the report and advice of the Board.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 12 MARRIAGE 1. Any male member of the Foreign Service who proposes to marry a person who does not possess Eritish nationality must notify the Head of the Personnel Department of his intention. I he Secretary of State reserves the right to inform the officer concerned, whenever the circumstances in his view necessitate this course, that, if he marries a person not possessing British nationality, he will have to resign. Comment :— It must be realised that, even when the Secretary of State does not adopt the course of calling on an officer to resign under this regulation, a marriage to a person who does not possess British nationality may well diminish an officer’s utility as a British representative abroad and limit the number of posts at which he can be employed. Marriage to a person who does not possess British nationality may even result, either immediately or at some later stage in the officer’s career, in there being no post in the Foreign Service to which he can properly be appointed. In this case every endeavour would be made to find other official employment for him, but, failing that, it may be necessary either to retire him on pension under the Foreign Service Act, 1943, or to place him en disponibilite until a suitable vacancy occurs. While en disponibilite the officer would draw no salary and would not earn pension rights, but the pension rights which he had previously earned or those which he would earn if re-employed afterwards would not be affected. 2. Any woman member of the Foreign Service who proposes to marry must notify the Head of the Personnel Department of her intention. As a rule a woman member of the Service will be required to resign upon marriage, but the Secretary of State reserves the right in special circumstances to permit her to continue as a member of the Service either unconditionally or subject to conditions. Comment :— This regulation applies to women members of the Service and to marriages contracted by them whether to British subjects or to other persons. When announcing in Parlia ment that His Majesty’s Government had decided to accept the report of the Gowers Committee on the admission of women to the Foreign Service, the Secretary of State said that this acceptance was “ on the assumption that a general marriage bar will be imposed which I shall hate the power to w’aive in exceptional circumstances.”FOREIGN SERVICE EE GELATION No. 13 DIVORCE L a member of the Foreign Service becomes involved in a matrimonial suit which may, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, bring discredit upon that member or upon the Service, the Secretary of State may call upon him to resign. A member of the Service who becomes involved in a divorce suit must therefore notify the Head of -the Personnel Department of the facts of the case at the earliest possible moment.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 14 ACCEPTANCE OF FOREIGN DECORATIONS 1. Generally speaking, members of the Foreign Service, like other persons in the service of the Crown, are not eligible for The King’s permission to accept and wear foreign decorations and medals. Such permission may, however, be given in the case of decorations conferred for distinguished services in the saving of life, or, if such a case should arise, services performed by a member of the Foreign Service while lent to a foreign Government, if he is paid by them and not from British public funds during the period of the loan. ‘2. A restricted form of permission may be granted in tliQ case of decorations conferred in recognition of personal attentions to a foreign Sovereign or Head of State, or a member of a foreign Royal Family, on the occasion of State or official visits by such person ages, in the case of decorations conferred upon His -Majesty’s Ambassadors or Ministers abroad when The King pays a State visit to the countries to which they are accredited, and in the case of decorations conferred upon Foreign Service officers when forming part of a Special -Mission when The King is represented at a foreign Coronation, Wedding, Funeral, or similar occasion, or upon any diplomatic representative when specially accredited to represent His Majesty on such an occasion (but not on the members of his staff). 3. The King’s Regulations do not contemplate the grant of any permission for the acceptance and wearing of foreign decorations offered to His Majesty’s Ambassadors or Ministers abroad when leaving, even on final retirement. When, as sometimes happens, a foreign Sovereign or Head of State presents a departing Head of Mission with a decoration without having given any previous notice, either to His Majesty’s Government or the recipient, of his intention to do so, and the recipient cannot decline it without giving- offence, he should make it clear that he will not be able to wear it without The King’s permission. The grant of this, however, must not be expected, and if it is refused the most that the recipient may expect is permission to retain the decoration as a simple souvenir not to be worn. 4. In any case in which a member of the Foreign Service learns that the bestowal of a foreign decoration upon him is in contemplation, his informant should be reminded of the desire of His Majesty’s Government to be consulted through the diplomatic channel before any final decision to confer it is taken, and also,2 if the case is clearly of such a character, that their consent is not likely to be forthcoming. In no case should the grant of The King’s permission be assumed. 5. The foregoing applies equally to medals, including State decorations not carrying membership of foreign Orders of Chivalry. Medals for saving or attempting to save life, whether awarded by the Head or Government of a foreign State or by private life-saving societies or institutions, may be accepted and worn without restriction. 6 . The wives of members of the Foreign Service are regarded as subject to the same general disabilities as their husbands where the acceptance of foreign honours is concerned.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 15 PRESENTATIONS A member of the Foreign Service may not receive gifts or presentations, whether in the shape of money, goods, free passages, or other benefits, from any person in recognition of services rendered by virtue of his official position, or, in any case, from foreigners resident in the foreign country where that member is serving, without having first secured the permission of the Secretary of State. Comment : — This Regulation, which also applies to the families of members of the Foreign Service, should not be regarded as applying to small personal gifts such as may be received from colleagues and friends.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 16 PRIVATE OCCUPATIONS 1. No member of the Foreign Service may, without the permission of the Secretary of State, accept any post in the management of any trading, commercial, industrial, financial, or professional firm or company. Comment: — Permission under paragraph 1 is only likely to be given in very exceptional cases, for instance in some cases permission to become a director in a small private company which is confined to members of the officer’s family may be given: or occasionally an officer may be permitted temporarily to take some part in the organisation of a firm as executor for a deceased relative until new arrangements for the carrying on of the firm’s business can be made. 2. —(1) No member of the Foreign Service may at any time engage in any activity which would in any way tend to impair his usefulness as a public servant. (2) No member of the Foreign Service may engage in any occupation or undertaking which might in any way conflict with the interests of the Service or be inconsistent with his position as a member of the Foreign Service. Comment : — (1) There is, of course, nothing to prevent members of the Service from becoming members of, or occupying posts on the Councils of, charitable or learned societies, provided that their responsibilities in that concern are not serious enough to conflict with the discharge of their official duties ^ and provided also that the activities of these societies are not such as to bring paragraph 2 ( 1 ) or (2) of this Regulation into play. ( 2 ) It is the duty of any member who may have any doubt as to the propriety of undertaking any particular work to consult the Head of the Personnel DepartmentFOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 17 ACCEPTANCE OF OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS 1. The assent of the Secretary of State must be obtained before a member of Grades 1-5 of Branch A of the Foreign Service, ^ ,!,m ) lesignation or retirement, accepts an appointment in a business or other body: — (a) which is in contractual relationship with the Government; (t&gt;) which is in receipt of any subsidies or their equivalent from the Government; (c) in which the Government is a shareholder; (d) which is in receipt from the Government of any loans, guaiantees, or other forms of capital assistance; (e) with which Services or Departments or Branches of Government are, as a matter of course, in a special relationship; and (/) any semi-public organisation brought into being by the Government and/or by Parliament. Aftei the lapse of two years from the date of retirement, such assent will no longer be required.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 18 INTEREST IN CONTRACTS 1. Any member of the Foreign Service having an interest in company or partnership or business with which a contract with a Government Office is concluded or may be concluded, must disclose the measure of that interest fully to the Deputy Under secretary of State for Administration in writing. 2. Any member who has occasion to come in contact in his official capacity with any matter concerning a company, partner ship or other business concern in which he has an interest, must disclose that interest to the Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Administration. 3. 1 aragraphs 1 and 2 of this Regulation do not, however, apply to the mere holding of shares in a public company by a member of the service unless such holding is so great as to give tne member a controlling interest in the sdid company.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 19 BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY 1. A member of the Foreign Service who becomes bankrupt 01 insolvent must at once report the fact to the Secretary of State. If the member is serving abroad, the report should be made through the Head of the post at which he is serving. Failure to report this matter is a grave disciplinary offence. 2. A member who has reported his bankruptcy or insolvency must then at the earliest possible moment submit a complete statement of the facts of his case to the Secretary of State, who will decide, in his discretion, whether the circumstances are such •as to call for disciplinary action under Regulation No. -lO/' l Comment: — (1) If the officer who has become bankrupt or insolvent has committed any act of dishonesty or has otherwise acted discreditably, he may be dismissed. The Secretary of State may also take steps to prosecute the offender if there is evidence of the misappropriation of public monies. ( 2 ) Pending the result of any enquiry into his case, the officer concerned may be continued in his post unless there is prima facie reason to believe that public monies have been or are likely to be involved, in which case he will be suspended. (3) In no circumstances may an officer who is bankrupt or insolvent continue to be employed on duties involving the handling of public money.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 20 POLITICAL ACTIVITIES A member of the Foreign Service seeking a seat in the House of Commons must resign from the Service before he issues his address to the electors or in any other manner publicly announces himself as a candidate.FOREIGN SERVICE REGULATION No. 21 OFFICIAL SECRETS AND CUSTODY OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS 1. It is the duty of every member of the Foreign Service to acquaint himself with the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts of 1911, 1920 and 1939. 2. Any offence under the Official Secrets Acts committed by a member of the Foreign Service is, unless the member establishes extenuating circumstances, a grave disciplinary offence (see Foreign Service Regulation No. 11 ), exposing the member to the disciplinary penalties for such an offence, whether or not he is also prosecuted for the criminal offence in the courts. Comment. The Official Secrets Acts apply to all confidential documents or information which come into the possession, custody or knowledge of members of the Service. Any improper communication of confidential documents or information is a criminal offence under these Acts, even if the communication is made to another person in His Majesty’s Service. It is also a criminal offence if a member of the Service fails to return official documents if their return is demanded by the Foreign Office (see .paragraphs 10 and 11 below and comment thereto as regards members of the Service who have retired and as regards the papers of members of the Service who die). The appendix to this Regulation gives extracts from the Official Secrets Acts containing those portions of them which are likely to be of most importance to members of the Service. Members of the Service, however, are not thereby excused from making themselves acquainted with the provisions of the Acts as a whole. No definition is given in the Acts of “official documents,” and there is no rule given in the Acts as to the burden of proof on the question whether a document or information was “entrusted in confidence.” So far as the application of the Acts is concerned, it is for the courts to determine their effect, and the Secretary of State has no authority to give an official interpretation of them. On the other hand, so far as disciplinary offences are concerned, it is within the power of the Secretary of State to make his own rules as to what shall be deemed to constitute “official documents” and as to what test shall be applied to determine whether information or documents are confidential. Certain rules for this purpose are inserted in paragraphs 6 and 7 below.2 3. Negligence by a member of the Service in the custody confideitTannf %° f Offi0kl 1 documents or in communicating confidential information is a disciplinary offence, and mav be regarded as a grave disciplinary offence.

( 1 ) Documents and correspondence may be official and confidential under this paragraph, notwithstanding that they have been addressed or sent in a personal form or marked ‘'personal” or m “ private.” Indeed under the paragraph the presumption is that they are official and confidential. It is, in fact, a common practice to send most secret information or most confidential instructions in a letter so marked. Similarly, oral information may be official and confidential although it has been given casually and in a non-official manner. (2) The enumeration in paragraph 7 is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. Written or oral communications irom non-official persons relating to matters of official concern may often be confidential official information and, if m writing, official documents. As indicated by the comment to paragraph 6 , the difference between documents which are covered by the enumeration in paragraph 7 (a) and information covered by the enumeration in paragraph 7 (b), and documents or information not so covered, is that in the former case there is a strong prima facie presumption that the document or information is both official and confidential, ami in tne latter case there is no such presumption. 8 . Members of the Foreign Service shall, on the outbreak of war or other emergency, destroy official documents which are in their possession or custody, in accordance with the instructions in force for such eventuality. Except in bases of they shall not destroy the originals or sole copies of officml documents except under authority from the Foreign Office, unless it is clear that such documents do not possess or no longer possess, any interest for the purpose of official record they may, however, from time to time destroy surplus copies or documents of ephemeral interest, in accordance with standing instructions. b 9. —(a) Members of the Foreign Service must not, without the permission of the Secretary of State, publish any book or article or give any public lecture or broadcast, which is based m whole or in part upon their experiences as members of the Service or upon information obtained by them as a member of the Service. (b) The reproduction in extenso of unpublished official documents (and this includes memoranda prepared by officials in their official capacity and with access to official information) is not permitted. '(c) Members of the Service, in publishing any book or article j )r ’f § lvin § an J public lecture or broadcast tafk (whether such book, lecture or talk is or is not based upon their experiences members of the Service, or upon information obtained bv them as members of the Service), must not, without the permission of the Secretary of State, refer to or permit any refeience to be made to the position they hold or have held as a member of the Service. 1.0 former members of the Foreign Service, or of those services which are now incorporated in the Foreign Service remain subject to the Official Secrets Acts as regards all official ocuments and as regards all confidential information obtained by them while members of the Service. 11 Whenever a member of the Service ceases to be a i ember, he shall inform the Secretarv of State of all papers m his possession which come, or may reasonably be thought o come, under any of the provisions of this Regulation. The Secretary of State may then give directions as to the future custody and disposal of such papers.

(reg. 21.)..'.V axr Man. From No .T .15- 3PG/47. The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, To The Under Secretary of State, India Office, London. Dated New Delhi 3,the 30th April 1947. Subjects- Future administration and control of His Majesty’s Government’s relations with the Arab States in the Persian Gulf. Sir 9 I an directed to convey the views of the Government of India on the matters contained in Lord Pethick Lawrence’s Despatch External No.l of the 4th March 1947 on the subject of the future administration and control of His Majesty's Government’s relations with the Arab States in the Persian Gulf. 2* It is recognised that the separation of the joint organisation which has existed for so long on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf is an inevitable corollary to the changes which are taking place in the broader political field in India&lt; The Government of India therefore concur with the proposal that direct control of the political administration in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf should pass to His Majesty’s Government. Although the date proposed ? 1 st of ^pril 1947, has passed, there seems to be no objection to its being regarded as the actual date of transfer of control. The advantages of this date in the interests of simplicity of accounting are considerable and it. is hoped that His Majesty’s Government will concur. 3. The Government of India agree, as far as may be i ' possible r to continue to maintain staff and services in /the] the area as at present during the current financial year as agents of his Majesty’s Government at the expense of Imperial Revenues, This agreement is qualified by the present uncertainty regarding the position after the announcement of the scheme for the termination of the Inuian Political Service and the Indian Medical Department. It is possible that circumstances may arise in which a sufficient number of the officers in these Services may not be willing to continue to serve in the Persian Gulf ? or to go there on relief. Once the right of premature retirement is conceded, it is felt that it will not be possible to compel officers to accept such a posting, as it cannot be described as essential in the interests of the Government of India, At present therefore the Govern ment of India can only undertake to retain in, or post to, the Persian Gulf officers who will stay or go there voluntarily. It is presumed, however, that little difficulty would be experienced in filling any vacancies thereby occasioned with officers selected for appointment : 'V to Mis Majesty's Foreign Service. 4 , I am to observe that no reference has been made to the subordinate staff at present employed in the This staff is chiefly clerical, but also includes a few medical subordinates. It is proposed to take up this question in greater detail in due course, after the inclinations of the staff have been ascertained; but I am to enquire whether His Majesty's Government would wish to engage such of the existing subordinate staff, as may be willing to transfer to the service of His Majesty's Gov eminent 5 on terms, including pension rights, not less favourable than those now enjoyed / 5 .-3- 5. With regard to tho future representation of Indian interests in the area, the Government of India welcome the suggestion that, until other arrangements can be made, Indian interests should be represented by the officers whose services are now being taken under the direct control of His Majesty’s Government* It is hoped, however, in due course, to establish separate Indian representation, and the form which this should take has been under consideration. The view of the Government of India is that it would only be necessary at present to establish an Indian Consulate at Bahrain. It would probably be possible for Indian interests at Kuwait to be supervised by the Consulate which it is proposed to establish at Basra, and for those in Muscat to be entrusted for some years, to a non-career Vice Consul. It is, however, of considerable importance that an independent Indian representation should be established in the area. There are already considerable Indian commercial interests, and it is inevitable that these will increase, with the development of the oil resources and the consequent rise in local prosperity. It also seems likely that there will be Indian air interests in the near future. N 6 . It is recognised that the proposal to establish an Indian Consulate at Bahrain might be held to conflict with the present treaty position between that principality and the British Crown. It is, however, felt that in this matter India can be regarded as having established a special position, India has, for generations, shared in the management of the interests of the British Commonwealth in the area, has provided personnel from her /services&gt;8 &lt;m 4- servicos for the administration, and Indian Revenues have met a considerable proportion of the cost. It is therefore claimed that India has, in fact, been continuously represented in the area as a junior partner and that no new principle is invoked by the continuation of this representation in a manner appropriate to her new status. I am therefore to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government will be able to accept this proposal. 7. His Majesty’s Government have proposed to take over, at an agreed valuation, Indian interests in such property, both movable and immovable, in the area as will be required to maintain the services. The Government of India agree to the transfer on these terms of all buildings, and of such movable property in the area as will not be required for the Indian representation which it is hoped to establish. 8 . The present examination of the case by the Govern ment of India has necessarily been confined to the general aspect. A detailed examination of the particular points involved has already been instituted, and these will be pursued in separ te correspondence. 9. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the United Kingdom High Commissioner, New Delhi. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, 7 / Secretary to the Government of India.

As you i^ready know, Caccia and Noble have recently visited the Gulf, and we have now heard from Noble about the loreign allowances, lie states that the present allowances, which were as you know assessed by reference to the officers emoluments itfien serving in the Indian Political Service, are in the main generous by Foreign Office standards, and it seems possible that Foreign Service officer 8 sent out in future to fill these posts would not need so much; in only one case, that of Hudson, A.P.A., Bahrain, is an increase recoimieuded. Details of the calculation of the revised allowance for Hudson are attached, and I shall be glad if you will sanction a basic fox&gt;elgn allowance of £1,100 in place of ths combined personal allowance (£730) and language allowance (£90) totalling £840 per annum previously authorised, the new alio ance to be effective from the date of Hudsons arrival at the post early in January. You recently gave authority to the Contnonwealth Relations Office to pay provisional foreign allowances of £500 per annum to Stobart and Andrew, the two seconded A 8 officers. As these officers did not arrive at the post until 29th Deoenfcer, they were unable to produce accurate budgets. Noble has, however, worked out a theoretical budget by reference to other figures, and he recommends an allowance of £650 per annum in each case from the date of arrival. Details are attached. Noble is of the opinion that the Gulf is, subject to oertaiiy' J.D.K. Beighton, Esq., Treasury.I cert ala qualifications* 'about the same order of costliness as Bagdad'. Tbs A VIII married and single allowances approved for Iraq are £1*000 and £575 respectively, and you sill see therefore that the proposed allowances of £1*100 and £650 for the grads In the Gulf are approxlicately in the same proportion. Although we do not contemplate having to send many Branch A officers to the Ck&amp;f in the near future we shall be sending certain Branch E staff for whom we will have to assess foreign allowances. Hoble has prepared a table* copy attached* which gives details' of the calculations of provisional Branch A allowances, we shall be glad to have your sanction to apply these rates In the ease of any new Branch A appointments and also to calculate Branch B allowances by the application of the usual formula to these figures. One of Coble's general recommendations Is that a more detailed inspection of the Persian Gulf should be carried out .In a year's time when.the allowances would be reviewed again.
