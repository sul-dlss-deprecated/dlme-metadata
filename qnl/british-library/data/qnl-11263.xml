Taken from an elevated position, this view looks out onto the harbour, with the dhow fleet at anchor from centre to right of the image and several British naval vessels at left.In the middle- and foreground to the right stone-built fortifications enclose an area occupied by palm-frond and wooden structures. At far right and far left flag-staffs may indicate the presence of British colonial buildings.Immediately right of centre three cannon point out to sea from the quayside. Several flat-roofed buildings occupy the foreground at the centre of the image while at left of centre a large warehouse-like structure dominates the middle-ground. At far left stands a white-washed, crenellated building.The image is captioned, dated and signed in pencil on the reverse of the leftmost image by Sir John Kirk, who was British Consul General in Zanzibar at this time.Inscriptions:Verso, in pencil: 'Zanzibar 1875 - J Kirk'Below image, in pen: 'Zanzibar'</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight John Kirk</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">photographer</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Zanzibar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Harbours</topic></subject><subject><topic>Navy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fortifications</topic></subject><subject><topic>Panoramas</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023618815.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
