THE SITUATION IN SOUTHERN PERSIA SECRET. 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire hae forwarded copiea of three telegrams, attached,' from the British Minister at T9hsran * relative to surprise attacks which have been made upon the 8outn Persian Rifles at Kazerun and Dashtarjin. Mr. Balfour in forwarding these telegrams supports Sir C.Marling’s recommendation that energetic action may be taken oe-iore this movement is allowed to assume more serious 2. The Commander-in-Chief in India has accordingly been informed that if after communication with General Maude he is 01 opinion that action from Bushire would relieve the situation on the Shiraz-Bushire road, the latter may be authorized, subject to the provision that commitments entailing subsequent relief operations must be avoided, to initiate such action. 3. The efficacy of any action which may be found practicable from Bushire is more than doubtful. The chief disturbing iactor in the present situation is undoubtedly the Kashgai cnieftan, Soulet ud Dowleh, whose mischievous activities, now supported by the intrigues of the German Wassmuss, have produced a similar situation, at the same point, as confronted ■he Swedes in 1S14. The situation is rendered more difficult by the disappearance of our ally, the old Kawan, on whom we could depend as a counterbalance to Soulet. The young Kawan is but a tool in the hands of the latter. The danger of the present situation lies in the possibility of a disaster to Sir-Percy Sykes' small regular force, the extension of the dimensions. presentpresent hostile movement, and its consequent repercussion upon the none too satisfactory situation among the Bakhtiari and other tribes on the flanks of our forces in Mesopotamia. 4 * 11 13 8Vi;i8nt from the course of events that the means on which we have relied to restore the situation in Persia have failed. In other words it has been proved that the mission under Sir Percy Sykes is of insufficient strength oo fulfil the objects for which it was intended, and it is imperatively necessary to take inmediate steps to furnish such requirements in officers, regular troops, machine guns or otiier material as may be adequate for the fulfilment of our purpose in South Persia. 5. As early as the 12th February, 1916, a force consisting of:- 2 Indian Battalions, 2 Squadrons Imperial Service Cavalry 1 Mountain Battery, J * 1 Machine Gun Detachment, was offered by the Imperial Government for employment in Persia under the Indian Government. This force was refused by the Viceroy on the grounds that it mi^it imperil the success of the scheme for raising the military police. Eventually, however, although a force of:- 4 - Indian Inlantry Battalions with 4 machine guns per . _ . Battalion, 1 Regiment Imperial Service Cavalry, were accepted, and ordered from Egypt on the 17th April, it was diverted to Mesopotamia by request of the G.O.C., and the present escort which has proved insufficient, namely;- 1 Section Mountain Artillery, 1 Squadron Cavalry, t Battalion Indian Infantry, was sent to Sir Percy Sykes, and has accompanied him through his long march in Persia. It should oe noted that the Imperial Government have - providedprovided 16 Persian speaking officers for the South Persian Pules and have a further reserve of 10 more who will go out within the next two months* In addition they have supplied material for, and initiated the undertaking of the telegraph line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman. 6. The above measures taken by the Imperial Government are quoted in order to point out that the failure noted in paragraph 4, has been due, not to lack of resources, but to the want of a suitable machinery for utilizing these resources. The Machinery hitherto employed has been that of the Foreign Department of the Government of India. In view o: the tact that during the course of the war military operations in Persia must be regarded as of paramount importance, and political questions, thou^i weighty, of secondary consideration, it is proposed that the control of the South Persian Rifles and their necessary escort sriould immediately be placed under the Commander-in- Chief in India. oir Charles Monro should be empowered to concert, in communication with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, such measures as may be advisable for the requirements of the forces above mentioned. 26.12.1916.riKUTK.

It argues that it is not quite fair to suggest that the failure to deal with the situation in Southern Persia was due solely to a lack of machinery, and suggests that a lack of resources was also a contributing factor. However, the minute does agree with the memorandum's proposal of placing the South Persian Rifles under the control of the Commander-in-Chief in India, so long as military action is taken with due regard both to political and diplomatic considerations and to the views of His Majesty's diplomatic representatives; the minute also advises that the Commander-in-Chief in India should invariably act in consultation with the Viceroy of India [Frederic John Napier Thesiger].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief of the General Staff</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commander-in-Chief, India</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Military Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir John Evelyn Shuckburgh</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kazerun</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dashtistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military operations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Armed forces</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000154#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
