To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. Family Pension Rules: Amendments to. 'Widows - remarrying subscribers. Marriages terminated by divorce or annulment. My Lord, In my Despatches Nos. 5 and 6, Accounts, Indian Civil Service dated the 6th August 1925, I requested Your Excellency's Government to obtain the views of officers in India on pro posed additions to the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Eules, the one designed to meet the case of marriages terminated by divorce or annulment, and the other the case of widows who have remarried subscribers. The observations of retired officers and officers on leave were at the same time sought in this country. The results of this enquiry are now available and have been con sidered by me in Council. 2; Of the opinions recorded on the Eule dealing with divorce, the great majority, includ ing those of the Service Associations, three in number, which have expressed a corporate opinion, are in favour of the Eule as proposed. Of the views expressed by the minority, the one most widely held is that the pension allowed to the innocent wife should be the whole rather than the half. I am satisfied, however, after considering actuarial advice, that the benefits allowed by the draft Eule are the utmost that can be allowed without detriment to the finances of the Scheme, unless, as is proposed by some subscribers, a guilty husband were compelled to subscribe for his divorced wife. I have already expressed my inability to accept the latter solution; and I have accordingly sanc tioned the Eule as originally proposed. Since the original draft was prepared the Eegulations have been recast in the form of Statutory Eules, and it has been necessary to alter the wording of the new Eule to bring it into accord ance with the requirements of that form, the substance Remaining, however, unchanged. I am unable 'to accept the suggestion which has been made by some subscribers that the new Eule should be retrospective. 3. The views expressed on the Eule dealing with widows who have remarried subscribers' do not offer equally clear guidance. There is a majority, but not a large one, in favour of the amendment proposed. Among the minority a considerable body consider amendment of the present Eule desirable, but prefer that the second husband should subscribe as a bachelor. After careful consideration of the comparative merits of these two alternatives, I have decided to retain the Eule as originally put forward and approved by the majority of those subscribers who have recorded their opinions. It has been necessary to redraft the Eule for the reasons stated above. 4. I enclose a Eesolution, which I have made in Council, effecting the necessary amendments in the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Eules. 5. I request that this Despatch and its en closure may be published in the .Gazette of India. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) BIEKENHEAD.

(3) Where the marriage has been termi nated by divorce on the petition of the husband he shall be exempted on remarriage from pay ment of donation other than disparity donation, if any, but this exemption shall apply on the first subsequent remarriage only. '* (4) In cases of annulment the subscriber shall be entitled to receive a lump sum the amount of which shall be fixed in each case by the Secretary of State in Council.

The Indian Civil Service Family Pen sion Regulations were designed to secure suitable provision for the widows and orphans of members of the Covenanted Indian Civil Service who, having joined the Service in 1881 or thereafter, were ineligible for membership of the Bengal, Madras, or Bombay Civil Punds. With the passing of the Government of India Act the Regulations became, under sec tion 96 b (4), Statutory Rules regulating the conditions of service of the Civil Services in India. They have accordingly been recast in a form more appropriate to Statutory Rules than that of the Regula tions previously in force, and are pub lished as Statutory Rules and Orders, 1925, Nos. 1019 and 1020. They do not differ in substance from the earlier Regu lations, save to the extent necessary to give effect to the decisions reached as a result of the Valuation as at 31st March 1923, published in the Gazette of India Extraordinary of 31st July 1925.

Extract from the Premature Retirement Rules (8th November 1921). 12.—(1) A member of the Indian Civil Service who retires under these Eules may adopt, at his option, any one of the three following methods of retaining for his wife and children benefits admissible under the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Regulations, namely: — (a) He may cease to make any contribu tions and payments under the regula tions, and shall then retain only the right to a proportion of the contingent benefits under the regulations for his wife and children existing on the date of retirement, and for any children subsequently bom to that wife. This proportion shall be equal to the number of his completed years' total service divided by 25, and the calculation shall be based upon the pension admissible to the widow of an officer of the class to which he belonged at the time of his retirement. (b) He may continue up to his 51st birth day to_ make contributions under the regulations at the rates payable by him at the date of retirement, and shall then retain the right to the full con tingent benefits admissible under thev^All nP Q 26 regulations, according to his class ont the date of his retirement, for his wife existing at the date of retirement, and for any children by her, whether bom before or after retirement. Under this alternative, subscriptions will be pay able under the ordinary regulations for each child, whether, born before or after retirement. In the event of the death of the wife, subscriptions at the bachelor rate appropriate to the subscriber's' class on retirement will be until age 51. (c) He may continue up to his 51st birth day to make contributions and pay ments under the regulations at the- rates which would have been payable by him from time to time had he re mained in the Service. In that case he shall retain the full benefits admis sible under the regulations as if he had remained in the Service until death or retirement with an ordinary pension. Provided that, in the event of the officer failing to notify within three. months of the date of his retirement tfhe method selected by him, he shall be deemed to have elected the first of the above methods. (2) The Secretary of State in Council shall' make good to the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Fund under a suitable procedure any loss which may be estimated to be thrown upon it by the operation of this rule.

MSriuD- 1,000-13-5-36—GIPPI ndia O ffice, W hitehall, L ondon, S. W.-l, , 1936. Indian Civil Service Family Pensions. &gt; Madam In March 1935 a circular was issued to all subscribers and beneficiaries under the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Eules conveying certain infor mation relating to the proposed transfer of the balances to Commissioners in this country. With this circular was enclosed a copy of a Eeport by the Gov ernment Actuary on the valuation of the scheme as at 31st March 1933, show ing both the position ascertained on the assumption that the existing arrange ments^ would continue, and^ the reductions in benefit which might prove neces sary in the case of subscribers and beneficiaries who elected for the transfer to the Commissioners of the balances appropriate to their interests. It was explained that^ no action in regard to the transfer of funds would be possible until the passing of the necessary provisions in the Government of India Act. 2. The Government of India Act, 1935, has now passed into law, and a copy of the relevant section (No. 273) is attached. It will be seen that the provisions of the section must be brought into operation by means of an Order by His Majesty in Council, which, under section 309 of the Act, can be made only in pursuance to an Address of both Houses of Parliament. A copy of the draft Order which was laid before Parliament on 21st April 1936 is enclosed. The date on which a motion will be made in Parliament for an Address to the Crown has not yet been settled ; but any representations to the Secretary of State relating to the terms of the draft Order which it may be desired to make [see last paragraph of subsection (1) of section 2731 should reach the India Office not later than 20th June 1936. The further procedure, after Parlia ment has approved the terms of an Order and it has been made by His Majesty in Council in pursuance of the Address from Parliament, will be as follows : As soon as possible following the making of an Order a notification that it has been made will be sent to each subscriber and beneficiary. Under subsection (3) of section 273 of the Act the Order must provide that any subscriber or beneficiary who wishes to remain subject to the existing conditions may make objection to the vesting in the Commissioners of the portion of the fund repre senting his interests ; and the notification will draw attention to the manner in which, and the date by which, such objection may be lodged, as laid down in the Order. It is desirable that an indication of the wishes of each person con cerned shall be given ; hut it must he clearly understood that, in accordance with the terms of the Act, any person who does not express an objection to transfer by the appointed date will he deemed to have assented to the vesting of his or her interest in the Commissioners. The information which follows is offered in the hope that subscribers and beneficiaries may find it of assistance in making their decision. 3, The Keport of the Government Actuary forwarded with the circular of March last (a further copy of which can be supplied on application) contained an estimate of the effects of the transfer of the balances to Commissioners based on the assumption that it would be possible to obtain a yield of 3| per cent, on investments in trustee securities. It was pointed out in the circular that the later trend of prices in gilt-edged securities had made this assumption no longer tenable ; and that a further investieratinn. assuming a lower rate of interest, LlSFinDwould be taken in hand. This investigation has now been completed, and the results, based on a rate of 3 per cent., are given in the table below. Group. Total Pension (including Government Grant). Rates at present in issue. £ Widows of present subscribers :— Class V Active „ IV „ „ III „ „ II „ Classes II—V Retired Class I (age under 50) Active and Retired 330' 330 330 335 335 335 „ I(50-59) 345 V £450, of which £50 is on a 360 temporary basis.

U. is on a temporary basis. 4. The pensions shown above as payable to the widows of subscribers in Classes IV and V are given on the assumption that the subscribers will have attained Class III or a higher class before their death. The pensions payable- to the widows of subscribers dying in Class IV or Class V would be at the rate of £275 per annum. The rate of pension shown as payable to children is that applicable to ages over 12. The rates payable in respect of ages 0-6 and 6-12 will be one quarter and one half of that amount respectively. The pensions payable to children of present subscribers can be ascertained proportionately from those entered as payable to widows, the rates after age 12 being in all cases one-third of the corresponding widows' pensions. A child, for instance, of a present subscriber in Classes III, IV, or V who elects for transfer may expect to receive £27 ICte. between ages 0-6, £55 between ages 6-12 and £110 onwards. The rate now payable after age 12 is £150, of which £133 65. 8d. is permanent and £16 135. 4^. temporary ; with proportionate amounts at earlier ages. The pensions at present in issue are paid at a rate 50 per cent, higher than the original scale, one-third of the increase being temporary and liable to with drawal if circumstances make such a step necessary. It is anticipated that for at least five years it will be possible, in the case of those who elect the present conditions, to continue this rate of pension payment. 5. It must Jbo emphasised that the figures given above are not to be inter preted as a definite statement of the amounts which will ultimately be payable. Such a statement could be made only in one event. It was explained in the circular of March 1935 that if the numbers of those recording objection to transfer were^ to small the resulting fund might tend to be financially' unstable, and the Act gives the Secretary of State a discretionary power, in those circum stances, to terminate its existence as an independent financial unit, and to grant fixed pensions payable from the revenues of the Federation. Should'that course be taken, the future scales of pension would, of course, be definitely known. So long, however, as the two portions of the fund both retain their independent financial status, the results must in each case depend on the actual experience in respect of the determining factors, the rates of mortality and marriage and the rate of interest. The latter in particular is difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy, and it is -desirable that the effects in each case of future changes in the rates should be made clear.senterl hv^n oH: 0 pr , € : sent the capital of the fund, which is repre sented b\ an obligation of the Government of India, is not liable to armrioi'r rnv 0 /i pr , eC ? a n 30n- 1 The rate of interest is fixed by the Secretary of State in Council, and follows, broadly, the movements of the yield on lono--term ludiA sterling debt The rate at present allowed is 4 per cen^ aTd it Ss been fUD^Tattributahl xo; ' ls ^at this rate will be continued in the case of the luncl aitrioutabie to persons who rearister obippfinn fn fmnafoT. r^- w, 4. u r r dertakin '- totTonttiretf this rate can given.

It will perhaps be of assistance if a brief explanation * gtoO' points regarding which a certain degree of misconception appears to have arisen. The benefits granted under the rules are divided into ^o portions one provided by the contributions of subscribers and the other provided from the revenues of India. The latter class consists of the following To widows of subscribers who die while in the classes mentioned £ Class V 150 per annum. „ iv .. .. •• no .,111 .. • • • • I 20 II 60 To fatherless children whose mother is living £ s. d.

The portions specified above will be charged on and paid out of the revenues of the Federation. They will, of course, be subject to the same safe guards as other payments of pension chargeable to Indian revenues. 11. The second point to which reference has been made is as follows : Certain subscribers and beneficiaries have enquired whether, if they elect to re main under the present conditions, their prospects would be in any way affected by variations in the exchange value of the rupee. The answer to this question is that, except to the extent mentioned below, the exchange value of the rupee has no bearing on the position. The basis of the Fund has always been and will remain a sterling one. The rates of benefit and contribution are expressed m sterling, and the balance of the Fund,, so far as it is attributable to persons who express'objection to transfer, will remain a sterling liability of the Government6 of India. The rates of pension payable will be determined in relation to tliis sterling sum, and will be unaffected by any variation in the value of the rupee. Such variations will react on the individual only in two cases, firstly, if as a subs criber he pays contributions in rupees, and secondly, if a beneficiary being resi dent in India elects to draw pension in that country. In such cases the rupee equivalent to the prescribed sterling subscriptions or pensions will vary accord ing to the current rate of exchange. It will be appreciated that so far as exchange enters into the matter it does so equally whether the subscribers elects for transfer to the Commissioners or not. 12. Pending the further uotification referred to in paragraph 2 above, no reply to this circular is necessary. Any representations, however, which you may desire to make will, of course, receive consideration.

A^atson, K.C.B., on the valuation of the Superior Services (India) Family Pension Fund as at 31st March 1934. 2. In May 1933 a circular, a copy of which is enclosed, was addressed to all subscribers asking their views on a proposal for the gradual transfer of the balance of the fund into the custody of Trustees. The arrangement con templated was that there should be handed to the Trustees annually all contri butions find interest received during each year, the pensions payable being met from the balance accumulated from past subscriptions. The effect would be that the balance in the hands of the Government of India would gradually disappear, and after a certain period the entire fund would be in the hands of the Trustees, who would thereafter be responsible for finding the sums required to meet the pensions due. 3. A large majority of the replies received from subscribers indicated a desire for the investment of their balances in sterling securities. A Note embo dying, with certain modifications, the proposals of the circular, was accordingly submitted by the Secretary of State to the Joint Select Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform. The Committee in its report to Parliament recom mended the inclusion in the India Bill of a clause on the lines proposed. Copies of the Note to the Committee, of the Committee's recommendation and of the resulting section of the Act as finally passed, are enclosed for your information. 4. It will be observed that the provisions of the Bill differ in certain im portant respects from the proposals contained in the circular of 1933. It was contemplated in the circular that the transfer to sterling securities would be effected by a process dependent on the actual payment of pensions, which would have taken many years to complete. In consequence of a desire expressed by many subscribers for a more rapid transfer, it was proposed in the Note to the Joint Select Committee that this scheme should be abandoned and one substituted whereby the transfer should be effected by such instalments as were permitted by the financial conditions, but subject in any case to completion within 12 years. As a result of careful consideration in the Committee it was suggested that the operation might be complete witMn a much shorter time, and the Act now provides for transfer within three years of the 1st April 1936, subject, how ever, to the provision that this period may be extended by Order in Council should it seem advisable, owing to a change in the financial conditions or for anv other reason, to prolong it. 5. It will further be seen that whereas the proposals contained in the circular contemplated that if a majority of subscribers were in fvaour of the transfer of the balances to Trustees this^ decision would be binding on the minority the Act provides that every subscriber and beneficiary shall have the option of remaining under the existing conditions. The probable effect will be to divide the fund mto two independent portions, part remaining as at present in the balances ot the Government of India and part transferred to the Trustees. A pension scheme the membership of which is small tends to be seriously affected by acci dental fluctuations in the rate of mortality or in other contingencies affecting its financial position ; with the consequence that unless a large reserve is kept against such accidents, the rates of benefit become lable to frequent alterations of inconvement magnitude. In order to avoid the drawbacks of such a position m the event of the numbers electing to continue under the existing arrangements being a comparatively small proportion of the whole, the Act grants to the Secretary of State a discretionary power to terminate the existence, as an inde pendent financial entity, of the portion of the fund allocable to subscribers and pensioners who elect to remain under the present conditions. The process LUFinD ^wouia l,o as follows. As sobn as the balance, membership and lars relating to this reduced fund were known, a valuation would bem^eofis assets and labilities with a view to ascertaining the maximum benefits which it SS WxiSS to produce. Thereafter, no further valuations ^would^. be made and the amounts of the benefits and subscriptions would not be subject to any variation, but benefits of the ascertained amount would be definitely guaranteed as charges against the revenues of India, while the . ac oumulated funds would lapse to the Government of India, m consideration of the liability was undertaking. Recourse to this measure will not, however, be had unless the results of the election show that it is advisable m the interests of the bene ficiaries concerned. 6 It will be seen on reference to the attached copy of section 273 of the Government of India Act that its provisions must be b J ou ^ h V n ^ 0 ooQ oMhe a S means of an Order by His Majesty in Council, which under section 309 of the Act can be made only in pursuance to an Address of both Houses of Parliament A copy of the draft Order which was laid before Parliament on 21st April s A enclosed The date on which a motion will he made in Parliament for an Address to the Crown has not yet been settled, hut any representations to the Secretary of State relating to the terms of ^onW desired to make [see last paragraph of subsection (1) of section snouia reach the India Office not later than 20th June 1936. The further procedure, after Parliament has approved the terms of an Order and it has been made y His Maiestv in Council in pursuance of the Address from Parliament, will &lt; e as follows : As soon as possible following the making of an Order a notifica tion that it has been made will be sent to each subscriber and beneficiary Undei subsection 8 of section 273 of the Act the Order must provide that any subscribe! or beneficiary who wishes to remain subject to the existing conditions may make objection to the vesting in the Commissioners of the portion of the fund repre senting his interests ; and the notification will draw attention to the manner in which and the date by which, such objection may be lodged, as laid down m the Order. It is desirable that an indication of the wishes of each person con cerned should be given ; hut it must he clearly understood that, in 'accordance with the terms of the Act, amy person who does not express an objection to transfer hy the appointed time will he deemed to have assented to the vesting of his or her interest in the Commissioners. 7. The Report of the Government Actuary indicates (paragraphs 11 and 12) that, in the case of subscribers who elect the present conditions, no increase in the benefits now secured will be possible at the presnet time, and, on the ot er hand, no reduction will be necessary so long as the rate of interest allowed on the balances continues at 4 per cent. In paragraph 19 the Report indicates the reductions which may become necessary in the case of subscribers and pensioners who elect for transfer. 8 It must be emphasised that these forecasts are not to be interpreted as a definite statement of the amounts which will ultimately be payable. Such a statement is in the nature of things impossible in the case of any fund organised on a mutual basis. It could be made, in the case of subscribers and beneficiaries who express objection to transfer, if it Were decided to put into operation the measure referred to in the latter portion of paragraph 5 of this circular. SO Ion a-, however, as the two portions of the fund retain their independent tman- cial status, the results must in each case depend on the actual experience m respect of the determining factors, the rates of mortality and marriage and r the rate of interest. The latter, in particular, is difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy, and it is desirable that the effects, in each case, of tutuie changes'in the rates should be made clear. 9. Under the present arrangements the capital of the fund, which is repre sented by an obligation of the Government of India, is not fiable to appreciation or depreciation. The rate of interest is fixed by the Secretary of State m Coun cil ;md follows broadly the movements of the yield on long-term India sterling debt The rate at present allowed is 4 per cent ; and it has been assumed in the calculations that this rate will be continued m the case of the fund attri- hutable to persons who register objection to transfer It mnst be ^erstood, however, that no undertaking as to the continuance of this rate can be giv. . The present level of India loans, if maintained, will make It necessary to con sider the lowering of the rate, and the effect might be a reduction in the rates of pension payable. It may, however, be observed that, under the rules, pensionsactually in issue cannot be reduced. Conversely, if the course of the stock markets justified an increase in the rate of interest, profits would accrue which might make an. increase in the rates of pension possible. 10. In the case of the fund attributable to subscribers and beneficiaries who elect for transfer, the rate of interest earned will for many years be determined, not by the level of security prices from time to time current, but by the level prevailihg when the initial investment is made. Assuming the investment to be made in stocks with a long currency, say 20 years or more, the yield will, to a great extent, be stabilised at the figure corresponding to the initial cost of the various investments. Subsequent changes in market conditions which enable a higher rate to be obtained will not benefit the fund, at least so far as its original amount is concerned ; for the money necessary to take advantage of the improved buying conditions can only be obtained by selling the existing investments at a loss. It is true that, if the fund is a growing one, the investment of yearly excesses of income over expenditure would gradually raise the rate of interest obtainable on the whole. On the other hand, if the fund should prove ro be a declining one, it would be necessary to provide for the sale of investments at a loss. Should future rates of interest tend to fall these results would, of course, bo reversed. It would be possible to avoid both the fixation of the rate and the adverse consequences of future changes in capital values by investing in securities of comparatively short currency. The yield now obtainable on such securities ia, however, small, and in the absence of any certainty as to the prospects of reinvest ment when the securities mature the sacrifice of income would be difficult to justify. 11. The above observations will perhaps make it clear that any estimate of the future must necessarily be tentative and subject to revision ; and that this is more particularly the case in regard to that part of the fund which will be vested in Commissioners. In view of this uncertainty it is not contemplated that the reductions foreshadowed in the rates of benefit as a result 1 of the transfer will be made at the outset. That some reduction in benefits will be necessary is clear ; but the extent of this reduction can only be assessed with any approach to accuracy when the decisions of subscribers and beneficiaries have been made, the nature of the future liabilities ascertained, and the appropriate funds invested by the Commissioners. The last-named operation must under the Act be completed by 31st March 1939, and it may not be, therefore, until after that date that final rates of benefit, which, though in the nature of the ease they must be liable to reconsideration, will have some prospect of perma nency, will be determined. Meanwhile, as a provisional measure, pensions in course of payment whose recipients elect for transfer, or becoming payable to the dependents of subscribers who have elected for transfer, will be issued at rates 4 per cent, lower than the full original rates in those cases in which the Report indicates a reduction of that amount, that is to say, in the cases of pensions to widows over 70 years of age on the valuation date 'and pensions to children ceasing at age 21 ; and in all other cases at rates 5 per cent, lower than the full original rates. Some loss to the fund must be occasioned by this course. There is, however, an offset to this loss in the higher rates of interest realised on the balances up to the date of investment; and since the number of pensions payable is as yet small, the results should not be serious. 12. In the event of subscribers, whether in the compulsory or in the voluntary sections, who have decided that their interests shall be transferred to the Com missioners, wishing to secure new benefits through the voluntary section, the terms of subscription will necessarily differ from those now published in the Schedules to the Rules. Amended tables will be prepared and made available to subscribers at an early date. The existing tables will remain applicable to all subscribers up to the date named in the Order in Council as the limit up to which objection to transfer may be lodged ; and thereafter will be applicable only to those subscribers who have recorded such objection. Pensions secured under the existing tables, by subscribers who elect for transfer, will, of course^ be subject to any reduction found to be necessary when the transfer and invest ment are complete. 13. It will perhaps be of assistance to add a word of explanation on a point regarding which some misconception seems to have arisen. Certain subscribers and beneficiaries have enquired whether, if they elect to remain under the present conditions, their prospects would be in any way affected by variations in theexchange value of the rupee. The answer to this question is that, except to the extent mentioned below, the exchange value of the rupee has no bearing on the position. The basis of the Fund has always been and will remain a sterling one. The rates of benefit and contribution are expressed in sterling, and^ the balance of the Fund, so far as it is attributable to persons who express objection to transfer, will remain a sterling liability of the Grovemment of India. The rates of pension payable will be determined in relation to this sterling sum, and will be unaffected by any variation in the value of the rupee. Such variations will react on the individual only in two cases, firstly, if as a subscriber he pays contributions in rupees, and secondly, if a beneficiary being resident in India elects to draw pen sion in that country. In such cases the rupee equivalent of the prescribed sterling subscriptions or pensions will vary according to the current rate of exchange. It will be appreciated that so far as exchange enters into the matter it does so equally whether the subscriber elects for transfer to the Commissioners or not. 14. Pending the further notification referred to in paragraph 6 above, no reply to this circular is necessary. Any representations, however, which you may desire to make will, of course, receive consideration. I am. Your obedient Servant, SIDNEY TURNER, Controller of Pension Funds.SUPERIOR SERVICES (INDIA) FAMILY PENSION FUND. Report by the Crovernraent Actuary on the Valuation as at 31st March 1934. Treasuey Chambers, S. W.-l, 31st October 1935. My Lord, In compliance with instructions received through the Controller of Pension Funds, 1 have valued the assets and liabilities of the Superior Services (India) Family Pension Fund as existing on 31st March 1934. 2-. This is the first occasion on which the Fund has been valued since its inception oil 1st September 1928, and if may accordingly be of interest to subscribers if a short preliminary explanation, in g'eneral terms, is given of the process of valuation. This process consists of an estimation, on the one hand, of the value of the benefits conferred by the Fund, discounted by interest down to the valuation date, and^ on the other hand, of the like value of the contributions payable in future, the difference between the two sums being the ' net liability ' against which assets accumulated out of past contributions (with interest) should be in hand. The comparison then made between the ' net liability ' and the assets (represented by the balance at credit of the Fund on the valuation date) determines whether the Fund is solvent, and where the assets are the greater of the two amounts the excess represents the amount of the surplus. In estimating, the present value of future benefits and contributions, it is ^necessary to have regard to a variety of contingencies, including the mortality rates expected to prevail among the subscribers, their wives (or widows) and their children, marriages of daughters and re-marriages of widows, and in the case of compul sory subscribers the probable marriages among unmarried subscribers, the probable number and ages of children left by the subscribers at their death, retirements of subscribers, and the rate of interest at which it is assumed that the accumulating funds can be invested. Apart from the rate of interest, all of these elements vary with the ages through which the persons concerned will pass in the future, and at each stage in the calculations appropriate assumptions must be made as to the conditions prevailing during the long 1 period which must elapse until the death of the last surviving beneficiary under engagements entered into with present or former subscribers. These engagements may extend over very many years ; to take a simple—and not extreme—example, an officer enter ing the compulsory section at the age of 21 (which is about the average age at entry) may not marry until he is approaching age 40, and may leave at his death a spinster daughter born when he was 41 and who lives unmarried and therefore a pensioner to the age of 80. As she was not born until 20 years after her father joined the Service the contract, beginning with contributions from the subscriber and later taking the form of a pension to the daughter, will have extended over 100 years. The valuation does not take account of the engagements in respect of officers entering the Service after the date as at which the valuation is made. 3. Past experience affords the only reliable guide to the assumptions which are thus required, and in the case of a fund of long standing, the experience of the fund itself is naturally taken, but where this is insufficient or lacking it is necessary to have recourse to other funds of a similar character. Thus, when the Fund was inaugurated, certain of the elements involved in the construction of the scales of contribution were based upon the experience of the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Scheme. It will be recollected also that ia loading of 5 per cent, was added to the contributions to provide a margin of safety in the event of the experience proving unfavourable in comparison with the basis adopted, a margin being especially necessary in view of the terms of Eule 3, under which the pensions of incumbent beneficiaries granted on a permanent basis cannot be reduced. It was, of course, contemplated that, should the margin prove to have been unnecessary, it would in effect be returned to the subscribers either by way of an increase in the benefits or a reduction in future contribu tions. 4. As a first step in the present investigation, the experience of the Fund in the period of five years and seven months between 1st September 1928 and 31st March 1934 was compared in each particular with the ' expectation ' result ing from the basis adopted in the construction of the contribution scales. This6 eomparison showed that the number of subscribers who died during the period Was greater than the number provided for, but as regards the other elements the actual experience was in close accord with the ' expectation. ' 5. While the mortality experience of the subscribers was in a direction unfavourable to the finances of the Fund,- it will be seen later that there have been various counteracting influences at work. After careful consideration of the results as a whole, and bearing in mind both the short time during which the Fund has been in existence and the fact that the contributions, as stated above, contain a loading of 5 per cent., I have come to the conclusion that there is as yet no necessity to alter the original basis of the finance of the Fund. That basis (with the 5 per cent, loading) has accordingly been employed for the pur pose of the valuation as at 31st March 1934. 6. A statement showing the number of subscribers who have joined the Fund since its inception, and of the subsequent changes up to 31st March 1934, is given in Schedule A attached. In the Voluntary Section, the figures (except as regards incumbent beneficiaries) relate to contracts and not to individuals. The numbers in the various categories at the end of the period were as follows :— Voluntary Section :— Number on 31st March 1934. Contracts for widows' benefits .. .. 640 Contracts for children's benefits to age 21 ;— (a) Sons .. .. .. .. 429 (&amp;) Daughters .. .. .. 302 Contracts for daughters' benefits till marriage .. 143 Total number of contracts for contingent benefits &gt;. 1,514 Incv'mbent beneficiaries :— : Number of widows.. .. .. .. 34 Number of sons—benefits to age 21 .. .. 9 Number of daughters—benefits to age 21 .. 7 Number of daughters—benefits till marriage. .. 11 Total number of incumbent beneficiaries .. 61 In addition, there was one re-married widow whose pension (£200) was suspended during the continuance of her later marriage. Compulsory Section :— Number of subscribers—married .. .. 16 Number of subscribers—unmarried .. .. 106 Number of contingent beneficiary children :— 7 Sons .. .. .. .. 8 Daughters .. .. .. 9 7. The Consolidated Account of Receipts and Expenditure for the period under review shows that the receipts from contributions amounted to £440, 670. Single premiums and .lump sum payments in commutation of monthly sub scriptions in the voluntary section constituted a very large proportion of this amount. The sums^paid under these heads were as follows :— £ Widows' contracts .. .. .. 238,381 Children's contracts to age 21 .. .. 16,623 Daughters'contracts to marriage .. .. 22,900 £277,904 More than two-thirds of these single premiums were paid in the first seven months of the Fund's existence, up to 31st March 1929. The interest earnings of the Funds during the period, including interest charged on arrears, were £91,358. The benefits charged on the Fund amounted to £7,945 in respect of lump sum payments and £16,735 in respect of annuities to widows and orphans, all in theYoluntai y Section. Further sums amounting to £10,221 were returned to sub scribers by way of surrender values in respect of contracts terminated. The Fund on 31st March 1934 amounted to £497,127. 8. It will be appreciated that the benefit payments in a fund of this nature are necessarily small in the early years and must increase gradually over a very long period, during which the annual balances of receipts from contributions and interest must be accumulated to provide for the time when the full weight of the benefit charges emerges. The rapid growth in the Fund up to 31st March 1934 is largely due to the substantial number of single premium contracts which have been effected in the Voluntary Section as shown in the preceding para graph, Fresh contracts of this nature are not likely to be so numerous in future, and while the growth therefore will probably be less rapid, the Fund can be expected to increase steadily for many years. 9. In accordance with instructions, the rate of 4 per cent, has been adopted as the interest basis for the purpose of ascertaining the position of the Fund, on the assumption that the present financial arrangements continue. This is the rate assumed in the construction of the tables of contributions and benefits. As stated in paragraph 5 above, the original mortality basis has also been retained. The contributions actually payable have been valued, and an addition of 5 per cent, has been made to the value of future benefits, including incumbent pensions. In connection with the latter, it may be observed that the widows r mortality rates were those used in the 1923 valuation of the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Scheme. Later experience of the Indian Civil Service Scheme indicates an improvement in the vitality of widows to an extent represented by an addition of roughly 5 per cent, to the value of their annuities. It is thus evident that the retention of the original margin in the valuation of widows' benefits is fully justified. 10. The result of the valuation, of which details are given in Schedule B appended, is as follows :— j Voluntary Section Present value of immediate pensions .. Present value of contingent pensions .. Present value of future contributions .. Net liability in respect of subscribers .. Contributory Section Net liability Total net liability .. Amount of the Fund .. Surplus £ 485,976 147,129 114,322 338,847 9,219 462,388 497,127 £34,739 Although the mortality experience has been unfavourable to the finances, the loading of 5 per cent, placed on the premiums has proved a substantial bulwark against loss in this direction while otherwise the working of the Fund as a whole up to 31st March 1934 has resulted in profits, with the ultimate effect of producing a surplus of £34,739, of which over one-half is attributable to interest received in excess of the equivalent of 4 per cent, per annum. The lemainder of the surplus represents the balance of a number of small items of profit and loss, individually of relative unimportance. The rate of interest to be credited to the Fund was reduced to 4 per cent, on 1st January last, and no further interest profits can therefore be anticipated. 11. The surplus is obviously too small to consider in connection with any concessions to subscribers and beneficiaries, and must be carried forward as a reserve for contingencies, particularly in view of the mortality experience. 12. The Valuation Balance Sheet given in paragraph 10 shows the position of the Fund on the assumption that the existing financial arrangements will continue, i.e., thai the balance at the credit of the Fund remains in the hands of the Government of India and is credited with interest in accordance with Rule 2. The valuation involves the assumption that the rate of interest so credited will not fall below 4 per cent.Transfer op Fund to Trustees in Britain. 13. In eonuection with the present investigation the Controller of Pension Funds informed me that certain proposals were thp Lmds transfer of the Fund, or part of it, from the Government of Inf ^ a n 'f* 0 . th ® ha '^ of trustees in Great Britain for investment in securities authorised by the Trustee Act I was requested to examine the probable effect of this proposed arrangement, which by the passage of the Government of India Act has now received the sanction of Parliament, the intention being, as I ^ submit preliminary proposals to the beneficiaries and subscribers to enable them to choose whether to remain under the existing conditions or to transfer the custodv of their balances to the hands of the suggested &gt; trustees. If an restricted option is given on an individual basis and opinion is not unanimous, the proposal involves the separation of the present Fund into two parts, one section continuing on existing Hnes and the other managed for investment pur poses by trustees in Great Britain. 14 Two points at once arise in connection with this proposal. Firstly, the membership of the Fund is not large and if this is divided into two bodies one, or both, of the separate sections may be so small nnmericaUy that fluctnatiomi in mortality and other elements may have an embarrassing effect on the ^nances- Secondly, funds invested in flrst-class securities in the hands of trustees in Great Britain cannot be expected to yield interest at the rates credited by tlie Government of India, and the capital value moreover will be subject to market fluctuation. The Fund as at present constituted has the advantage that bemg held by Government, it does not run the risk of capital losses through fluctna- tions in market values. 15. It is not possible to give any precise indication of the effect of the first point. Generally speaking, if the valuation of a fund with a small membership shows a surplus, a greater proportion of the surplus has to be reserved for contingencies than is considered necessary m a case where membership is large and experience consequently more stable. A deficiency also is a more tangiWe probability owing to the greater liability to fluctuation, and it follows that a o I eater degree of caution is necessary m fixing the^ benefits and contributions. The effect of the second point raised in the preceding paragraph is the mam matter for preliminary examination at the present stage. The rate of interest at which the valuation of a superannuation or widows and orphans pension fund should be made should obviously be such as is likely to be realised on the investments of the fund over a very long period m the future It is, of course, impossible accurately to forecast the future trend of interest rates. But the earlv transfer of a large capital sum, and its investment m trustee stocks on which only a low yield can be obtained, must necessarily exert a marked influence on the financial position of the fund in the future After consultation, the conclusion w^s arrived at that if the balance at credit of the Fund were invested in British stocks the valuation of the Fund should be made at a rate of interest of 3 per cent, and that rate has accordingly been adopted for the purpose now under consideration. 16 As regards the other elements (mortality, etc.), the basis including the addition of 5 per cent, to the value of benefits is the same as that employed m the valuation at 4 per cent, the results of which are given in paragraph 10 above. The valuation, as thus revised, reveals a deficiency of £128,393, as follows . £ £ Voluntary Section :— . ioqkh ^ Present value of immediate pensions .. •. i^»,oub Present value of contingent pensions .. 616,048 Present value of future contributions .. 154,135 Net liability in respect of subscribers .. .. 461,913 Compulsory Section :— okiai Net liability .. •• • • • • d5 &gt; lul Total net liability .. • • • • • • Amount of the Fund •• •• •• ^ 7 Deficiency . • £128,393Thus, the effect of reducing the valuation rate of interest from 4 per cent, to 3 per cent, is to convert a surplus of £34,739 into a deficiency of £128,393, i.e., to weaken the position by £163,132 on a fund of £497,127. 17. The funds to be transferred will, of course, be only such part of the total as is applicable to the subscribers and beneficiaries who take the option to transfer, and this will not be known until the new conditions have come into force and the option has been exercised. If, however, it be assumed that the whole fund would be transferred, involving adjustments of benifits as a consequence of the change of interest from 4 per cent, to 3 per cent., an indication of the revised benefits can be given. Calculations have there fore been made with that purpose. 18. In order to maintain equity among the different classes of persons interested, it is necessary to ascertain in the first instance what parts of the funds in India are applicable to the several groups of subscribers and bene ficiaries. When the funds have been so apportioned, it can then be ascertained what benefits can be given to each of the several groups on the 3 per cent, basis. It is to be noted that the separation of the membership into groups is due to the fact that the change of interest from 4 per cent, to 3 per cent, affects the various groups to a different extent. For example, the effect of such a reduction of interest on the value of an aged widow's pension is trifling compared with the corresponding effect in the case of a young subscriber who normally will con tribute for a long period and to whom the Fund is under commitments the fulfilment of which may not begin for many years, and being of the annuity type may not be completed until a further prolonged period has elapsed. 19. The results of calculations made on the basis as described above are given in the table which follows, the membership having been divided into certain broad groups primarily for the purpose of illustration, but which, in order to avoid undue complications, might perhaps be adopted, also, in practice. (This point is dealt with more fully in paragraph 21.) This table shows the average percentages by which the benefits of each group have to be reduced, and the reduced amounts to which, on the average, contracts originally effected on the standard scale of £200 have to be adjusted.

Daughters' pensions till marriage .. 14 ^ .... 20. The results of the foregoing table are based on the assumption that the transfer took place and the reductions in benefits became effective on the valua tion date. Since, however, the transfer did not in fact take place then, and pensions have continued to be paid at full rates, it might appear that somewhat LUFinD10 larger reductions would be necessary as from the actual date of transfer in order to make good the cost, on the 3 per cent, basis, of maintaining the pensions at full rates between the date of valuation and the date of transfer. But, on the other hand, the Fund in India has been earning interest in excess of S per cent, and the profits from this source can be set against the extra cost of benefits Provided that the transfer takes place within the next year or two it is unlikely that ibe revisions of benefits required will be materially affected and those shown in the table above may be taken as a reasonable indication of the position on the average when the date of transfer is fixed. 21 A further point arises for consideration in connection with the actual rates of benefit to be granted after transfer. In order to keep the above table within reasonable limits, fairly broad irroups have been selected tor the purpose of showing the probable averages, and although the differences between the revised benefits of adjacent groups are small, there is scope for variation within anv group if strict regard is had to individual cases within the group. This is a point which mav be considered to be of some importance in connection with the position of existing subscribers in the Voluntary Section. These subscribers paid, or are paving, contributions purporting to bj&gt; strictly related to the liabilities of the individual contracts, and it may be contended, with some justi fication, that on transfer regard should be had, not only to the ages ot the sub scribers, but also to the ages of the contingent beneficiaries. For example, m the case of a subscriber aged 50 whose wife is 10 years older, the reduction in I enefit should be about 15 per cent., whereas, if the wife were 15 years younger, the reduction should be 24 per cent. These are, no doubt, extreme cases, but it will be observed that in the group in which they are included in the above table, the average reduction is 21 per cent., which is the proper reduction in a case where the wife is about 5 vears younger than the subscriber. Revision on the lines here indicated would involve a special actuarial calculation for each individual contract. On the broader lines forming the basis of the table m paragraph 19, the adjustment of the contracts would be comparatively simple. Whether the broader basis can be regarded as making reasonably sufficient allowance for the claims of equity, or whether considerably greater expense should be incurred in making individual actuarial calculations may be left for later consideration. The table given in paragraph 19 should be sufficient for present purposes I am, etc., ALFRED W. WATSON. The Secretary of State for India. SCHEDULE A.— S ummary of D ata. Voluntary Section.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State in Council of India to address you on the subject of the measures to be taken in connection with the impending consti- tutionai changes in India to secure the payment of pensions under the rules of the Superior Services (India) Family Pension Fund. It is recognised that the balance of this Fund is the property of the sub scribers from whose contributions it has been accumulated. The Secretary of State in Council desires therefore to make every possible effort to meet their wishes with regard to its disposal. Frequent representations have been made to him in the past that fund balances should be transferred to England and held there outside the Indian Government account, and he is prepared to consider re commending to His Majesty's Government the inclusion in the forthcoming Bill of provisions to this effect, on the lines set out below, if the subscribers, after considering the financial effects of this measure, should hold it to be desirable. The proposals which I am to submit for your consideration are as follows :— That Commissioners or Trustees should be appointed for the purpose of holding and investing on behalf of the subscribers, in approved securities which would presumably be confined to those authorised by the Trustee Act, sums handed over to them ; that these Commissioners should be paid annually for this purpose the contributions received during the year and the interest allowed by the Government of India on the balance remaining in its hands, and that money for the payment of pensions as they fall due should be provided by the Government of India out of the balance in its hands, which would thus, be gradually reduced, so that ultimately the entire balance would be represented by sterling investments. It is clearly essential, before any judgment can be formed as to the relative advantages or disadvantages of this scheme, to obtain some idea of its effect on the prospects of pensioners ; and a comparison between the rates of interest obtainable on British securities with those now allowed on the balances will at once make it evident that this effect must be adverse. The position of the scheme in the matter of interest has in the past been highly favourable. The rate allowed on the balances has corresponded closely with that obtainable on the long-dated sterling debt of the Government of India; and during the whole of the period of high interest rates which commenced in and succeeded the War the balances received the benefit of high interest without the loss in capital value which would have been suffered had they been invested in actual securities. The rate allowed on the balances is now 4-^ per cent., to which figure it was reduced on 1st January last from 5 per cent, previously in force. The rate current on British securities is at present only 3^ per cent, or less ; and should the rate rise in future it would be necessary to face a decline in capital value, unless investment were to be made in securities with an early date of re demption on which the yield is even less than 3^ per cent. It should, perhaps, be added that, whereas interest added to the balances is not now subject to income-tax, interest received in the form of dividends on actual investments would, under the existing law, be to some extent liable to tax. The diminution of income thus caused would be small, inasmuch as the liability extends only to the excess of interest over the pension payments during the same period ; but in order to avoid this additional drain on the funds. Parliament will be asked, if the scheme is accepted, to exempt the interest on the funds from income tax by a clause in the new Government of India Act. The existing rates of contribution in the compulsory section, and the scales of premium applicable to contracts in the voluntary section, were drawn up on the assumption that interest at the rate of 4 per cent, would be realised on the balances. The Government Actuary has been asked to calculate the alterations which would have been necessary had a rate of 3-&gt; per cent, only been assumed ; and a copy of his report (which deals also with other pension funds) is enclosed.14 It will be seen that Sir Alfred Watson estimates that, under these conditions, it would have been necessary to provide in the compulsory section for pensions 15 per cent, lower than the present scale ; or, alternatively, to increase subscrip tions bv about 17| per cent. In the voluntary section the pensions to be secured by a given premium would be reduced by varying percentages according to the age at entry, ranging from 15 per cent, at the younger ages to 10 per. cent, at the older. In the case of future entrants, whose subscriptions would, under the proposed arrangements, be accumulated wholly in this country, it would be necessary, if the scheme were adopted, to apply these revised rates forthwith. Similarly, in the case of existing subscribers in the compulsory section, whose accumulated subscriptions are at present negligible in comparison with the premiums still to be received, it would be necessary either to reduce the amount of the pensions secured or to raise the rate of subscription. In the case, however, of existing subscribers in the voluntary section, less drastic measures would for two reasons be possible. The Fund has now been in operation for years and^ a further period must in any case elapse before the new proposals can come into force, during the whole of which the balances will have received the benefit of interest at 5 and 4| per cent., with the result that an appreciable surplus should have accrued. Secondly, it is contemplated that transfer of the balances to this country should take place gradually, and unless a fall occurs in the yield of Indian sterling securities, which governs the rate allowed on the balances in the hands of the Government of India, the average yield on the whole balance may y for some years, appreciably exceed 3| per cent. The benefit of these mitigating factors would naturally be given to those who hav3 contributed the balances on which the excess interest has arisen or will arise. It should be possible, before any definite action is necessary, to make a mor3 detailed investigation of the scheme than the time available has hitherto allowed, and on the results of this investigation the precise measures to be adopted will depend. Meanwhile, it can only be conjectured that, in the case of subscribers who have secured pensions by the payment of single premium, and who have, therefore, a proportionately large share in the balance, little or no reduction in the benefits secured will be necessary ; while in the case of sub scribers by monthly premium, the reduction, if any, should be appreciably less than that contemplated in the case of new entrants. Incumbent pensioners, who are few in number, are entitled under the rules to a continuance of pavments at the present rate. I am to request that you will, after consideration of the probable effects on the finances of the fund as indicated above, state whether, in the event of the Secretary of State being willing to recommend to His Majesty's Government the inclusion in the coming Bill of provisions for the gradual investment of the balances in this country, you would be in favour of such a scheme. It would be convenient if your reply could reach this Office by the end of June. I am.

One category of pension payment stands in so special a position as to demand separate consideration. We refer to the pensions payable to families of ofiicers, civil and military, the cost of which is met not from the revenues of India but frorn credits accumulating in the balances of the Government of India from subscriptions paid by the officers themselves. The Government of India are trustees of these credits and the fullest possible consideration should be given to the views of the subscribers and beneficiaries as to the future administration of the trust. A Note by the Secretary of State for India which is printed in the Committee's Records contains full particulars of these credits and the steps already taken to ascertain the views of subscribers. The Note also contains in outline proposals for the consideration of subscribers and pensioners. The matters to be decided are technical and complicated ; and we hope therefore in consulting subscribers that every effort will be made to put the issues before them in the clearest possible wav. We are glad to observe from paragraph 8 of the Note that the Secretary of State hopes that, unless the present financial situation unexpectedly deteriorates, it will be possible to convert existing rupee credits in India into sterling funds held in J country within quite a short period after the Constitution Act is passed and the wishes of subscribers and pensioners are kn'own. We recommend that this should be done and that action should be taken generally on the lines indi cated m the Note. Extract from Record containing Papers laid before the Joint Committee.

In paragraph 73 of the introduction to the White Paper it was stated that His Majesty s Government considered that the balances of the Family Pension Funds must be recognised as a definite debt liability of the Government of India an as the property of subscribers ; and that they were examining a proposal ^ g radu al conversion of these assets into separate sterling funds. wl.iri' Tlie Fu f ds r f fe j' red to do not include various funds, civil and military, which were established m the time of the East India Company under private management.

In May 1933 circulars were issued to subscribers ot all tour tunas mvumg their views on the following suggestions :— That Commissioners or Trustees should be appointed for the purpose o holding and investing on behalf of subscribers in approved securities, which would presumably be confined to those authorised by the Trustee Act, sums handed over to them ; that these Commissioners should be paid annually for this purpose the contributions received during the year and the' interest allowed by the Government of India on the balances remaining in its hands, and that money for the pay ment of pensions as they fall due should be provided by the G-overn- ment of India out of the balances in its hands, which would thus be gradually reduced. It was pointed out to the subscribers that by investment in Trustee Stocks it was improbable that the Commissioners would be able to secure a yield equal to the rate of interest allowed on the balances under the existing arrangements, which is based on the current yield of India long-dated sterling securities ; that allowance might have to be made, particularly in the present conditions, for capital depreciation of investments, a risk from which the Funds are now exempt ; and that as a result it was probable that the proposals would involve some reduction in the rates of pension now payable. 7. The effect of the above proposals would clearly be that the balance in the hands of the Government of India w'ould gradually disappear as it was drawn upon to meet the demands of a growing pension list ; while a new fund would gradually be built up from the investments made by the Commissioners. The period which would elapse before the transfer was complete, that is to say before the entire balances in the hands of Government had been paid out, would vary with the different Funds. It has been estimated at from 15 to 20 years in the case of the Indian Military Service Family Pension Scheme, and at as much as 40 years in the case of the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund, with intermediate periods in the other cases. 8. A large majority of the replies received from subscribers indicated a desire for the investment of the balances in sterling securities, but the scheme outlined in the circulars was criticised on the ground that the period elapsing- before transfer would be complete was too long. In order to meet this criticism) it is proposed to abandon the scheme whereby the rate of transfer would be regulated automatically by the amount of the annual payments of pension ; and to substitute a scheme whereby transfer could be made at any rate allowed by the financial conditions of the time, but subject in any case to the completion of the transfer by a fixed maximum period. It is hoped that, in practice anv maximum period will be inoperative. Should existing financial conditions continue without serious deterioration, it should be possible to complete the transfer within quite a short period after the Constitution Act has been passed and the subscribers and pensioners have expressed their final assent It will however, probably be desired that a limit shall be set by statute to the period of transfer ; and in fixing this limit it is necessary to consider the possible effects on the exchange position of the Government of India. A scheme of this nature-imposes no ultimate charge on Indian Revenues, which are in any case liable to pay the entire balances sooner or later in the form of pensions. It involves, however, the disbursement in sterling within the limits fixed of sums which would otherwise remain a liability to be met at a later date ; and such an addi tion to the sterling requirements, if sufficiently large, might in certain circum stances become embarrassing. It would be imprudent to impose on the finances of the Federation what might prove to be an intolerable burden ; and it is thought, therefore, that the statutory maximum period should not be shorter than 12 years. This period is intended only as a limit by which the Govern ment would be bound. As just indicated, it is expected that it will actually prove possible to complete the transfer within quite a short time. 9 It is not contemplated that the Commissioners should have any responsi bility for the administration of the pension schemes, or for the collection of subscriptions and disbursement of pensions. The administration would remain in the hands of the Secretary of State, who would decide, after consultation with subscribers, all puch matters as rates of contribution or pension, changes in the re o, ulations, &amp;c. The disbursement of pensions and collection of sub- scriptions^would continue to be carried out through the ordinary paying agencies of the Government of India. The function of the Commissioners, therefore, would be solelv that of holding and investing money handed over to them, and of supplying from the funds in their hands, when required, money for the payment of pensions. 10. Inasmuch as the proposals, if accepted, would involve a change in the conditions under which members of the Funds have hitherto subscribed, and moreover a change which, in some respects, for instance, in regard to the rate of interest realised, would be to their disadvantage, it is held that even though a large majority may desire the change it would be inequitable to impose on a minority who are content, as at present, to rely on the credit of the Government of India, the consequences of transfer. It is contemplated, therefore, that before any action is taken on the lines indicated above, circulars should bo issued to all subscribers and pensioners setting out, as fully as possible, in the light of actuarial investigations now in progress, the prospects under the present conditions and those, necessarily less favourable, which may be ex pected if the funds are invested in sterling ; and that each subscriber and pensioner should be asked to elect one or other of the two alternatives. 11. It should perhaps be mentioned that it will not be possible to put before the subscribers the precise effects of the election they will be called upon to make. The actuarial reports will show the results on the two suppositions that on the one hand the present arrangements are maintained in toto and on the other that the entire funds are invested in sterling. The effect of a reduction in the rate of interest is not, however, the same on all types of policy. It clearly varies with the probable duration of the liability, and must be greater in the case of a young subscriber, in respect of whom it is necessary to take account of possible pensions payable 70 years hence or even later, than in the case of an elderly subscriber or beneficiary. The results obtained for the whole of the funds will, therefore, only be true of portions of those funds if the portions are samples of the whole, containing the proper proportion of each class, old and young, subscribers and beneficiaries. If, on the other hand, the result of the elections is to split the funds to a great extent by classes ; if, for instance, the majority of older subscribers and beneficiaries elect to remain under the existing conditions while the younger choose transfer to sterling investments ; then the effects on the two portions of any fund would differ both inter se and from the effects ascertained for the fund as a whole. While, therefore, every effort will be made to arrange the material in such a manner as to give the fullest informa tion, it will be necessary to state that the figures must be regarded as to some extent provisional, and that the final effects can only be known after the election is actually made. 12. The division of the various funds each into two portions, which, apart from the highly improbable contingency of a unanimous vote, must be the effect of the election, may produce certain undesirable results. The financial stability of any pension scheme depends on the realisation of the estimates made of the prospects of death, marriage, fertility, &amp;c. ; and the smaller the membership the greater is the probability of casual variations from these estimates. There is, therefore, a danger that, if one or the other portion of any divided fund were a small proportion of the whole, it might produce irregular results, and be found, at a later date, either to be unreasonably large in comparison with its liabilities18 or, more regrettably, to be inadequate to discharge them. In the case of those who elect for transfer to invested funds no special steps in relation to this pos sible danger seem necessary ; firstly because it is improbable, in view of the opinions already elicited from subscribers as recorded above, that the funds constituted by these subscribers will be unduly small, and secondly because, as the position will have arisen by their own action and largely on their own Initia tive, it is reasonable that they should bear the consequences. In the case, how ever, of those who elect to abide by the present conditions it is felt that they should be protected from any ill effects consequent on the withdrawal of the majority. It is contemplated, therefore, that if the numbers remaining are m anv case too small to offer a reasonable prospect of stability, the fund should be'taken over bv the Government of India on lines similar to those followed in the case of the Presidency Funds in the last century ; that is to say, that the Government of India should assume full possession of the balance on deposit in iis hands and should receive, as sums due to Indian revenues and not as deposits, all future contributions ; and should guarantee the payment from the revenues of India of pensions at such rate as might be shown, by actuarial valuations specially made for the purpose at the date of taking over, to be justified. 13. The above proposal would involve the possible extinction, in the case of the subscribers or pensioners electing to remain dependent on the Government of India, of their existing right to benefit derived from their accumulated mnds, and the substitution of a different right, namely, to fixed benefits payable from the revenues of India. In the case also of those subscribers who elect to rely for their dependants' pensions on funds invested in sterling securities there would be, as has been said above, a material change in the conditions under which they have bhherto subscribed ; and though in this case the change will have received the assent of all the individuals concerned, it is desirable, if not essential, that any doubts as to the legitimacy of the action should be set at rest by legal sanction covering both cases. 14. Inasmuch as it is desirable that the measures taken in the case of each fund should accord as closely as possible with the views expressed by sub scribers, which may not in all cases be identical, it seems inadvisable to include in the Constitution Act itself definite and final provisions. A form of per missive enactment would appear to be preferable, and it is therefore proposed :— That His Majesty should be empowered by the Constitution Act to direct by Order in Council the appointment of Commissioners for the pur pose of receiving moneys accruing to or belonging to all or any of the Family Pension Funds, and of holding or investing the same for the purposes of the Funds ; and to make regulations for the transfer to the Commissioners, in such manner and within such a period as may be prescribed, of the moneys accruing to the Funds and the balances in the hands of the Government of India : provided that the period prescribed shall not exceed 12 years from the 31st March following the passing into law of the Constitution Act : and provided further that the regulations shall not require the transfer to the Commissioners of moneys or balances relating to liabilities in respect of subscribers or pensioners who have signified their objection thereto : That the interest and dividends received by the Commissioners so ap pointed on sums invested in their hands shall be declared exempt from Income Tax : That the Order in Council may prescribe an authority to determine the rate of interest to be added on the balances remaining in the hands of i he Government of India : That the Order in Council may further provide that, in the case^ of any subscribers and beneficiaries who shall have signified their objections to the transfer to the Commissioners of the moneys or balances re lating to their liabilities, it shall be open to the Secretary of State to grant to the said beneficiaries, or to the dependants of the said sub scribers, a right to benefits payable from the revenues of India at fixed rates to be determined by him, and that the moneys and balances aforesaid shall in consideration of such grant lapse to the revenues of India and the Government of India shall be discharged of all liability in respect thereof.

In the event of the number of subscribers and bene ficiaries who object to transfer being insufficient to offer a reasonalle prospect of financial stability, the wording of section 273U)(b) is sufficiently wide to per mit the Secretary of titate, instead of framing rules to continue the existence of the funds as independent self-s f supporting financial entitles, to adopt the alternative course referred to in paragraph 6 of the circular to Indian Oivil SerYiee sot) sari 'bars and corresponding paragraphs in the regaining circulars.

For the purpo-se of ascertaining which of the various categories enumerated in the first column of the Table should be taken as offering the best indication at present available of the pension likely to be obtained gfter transfer, the several items should be interpreted as follo?/ss- Items 1 to 4 indicate the rates of pension estimated to be payable to the widows of subscribers in active service on 31st March 1937. Item 1 covers the case of those with less than 7 years 1 completed service at that date (Class V); item 2 those with 7 and under 12 years' conpleted service CClass IV); item 3 those with 12 to 15 years 1 service iClass HI); and item 4 those with 15 and under IS years 1 service (Class II). Items 5 to 7 indicate rates of pension estimated to b be payable to the widows of subscribers in active service on 31st March 1937, who had at that date completed 18 years' service; and to the widows of retired subscribers living at that date who had, a t the time of retirement, completed 18 years service. The ages in all cases should be taken as those of the subscriber on 31st March 1937. The next six items indicate the rates of pension estimated to be payable to the widows 0 f retired subscribers living on 31st March 1937, who had, at the date of their retirement, less than IS years' service, the ages should be taken as referring to the gge of the subscriber, not at the date of retirement, but at 31st March 1937 . + , ■ ta37, V 8 rtem 8 covers'tne case of subscribers wiio iiad retirea before 31st Marcii 1937. witn less tnan 12 years 1 completed service and wJao, on tnat date, will be under bO years of age; item 9 covers the case of subscribers wno nad retired witn more tnan 12 but less tnan 18 years T service, ana who on 31st Marcn 1937, will be unner bO years of age; and similarly for items 10 and 13.

Tne ages in all cases snould be taken as tnose of tne widow nersell on tnat date. When tne transfer of tne fund is complete and the actual reassessment of pensions is carried out, it may be found desirable to subdivide or supplement tne above mentioned groups in order to avoid incongruities in tne grading of tne pension scale. It must in any case be remembered tnat as indicated in paragraph 4 of tne circular referred to above, no definite statement can be made as to tne pensions which will ultimately be paid.

To subscribers and beneficiaries who have objected to transfer. February, 1939. Sir/Madam, I am directed to forward for your information copies of two reports by Mr. G. S. W. Epps, G.B., CB.E., on the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Fund. Of these reports the first deals with the valuation of the Fund as at 31st March, 1937, and the assessment of the portions attributable respect ively to subscribers and beneficiaries who have assented to the transfer of their interests to Commissioner^ in this country and to those who have bjected to transfer. It will be seen that the sum representing the interest of the objectors is £1,029,769-1-0 It may be observed that whereas Section 273 of the Government of India Act, and the Order in Council made under that Section, direct the transfer of the balances of the Fund as at 31st March, 1936, subject to the retention of such portion as represented at that date the interests of the objectors, the valuation of the respective interests has in practice been carried out as at 31st March. 1937. In view of the fact that it was im practicable to obtain the decisions of the various subscribers and bene ficiaries affected before the latter date this procedure has been adopted as being the only method available in practice of carrying out the intentions of the Act. In view, however, Of the modification of the proce dure laid down by or under the Act, H. M. Government propose at an early date to lay before Parliament an amendment of the Act substituting the date 31st March, 1937, for that of 31st March, 1936. The second report deals separately with the position and prospects of the untransferred section of the Fund. It will be remembered that, under Section 273 of the Government of India Act the conditions under which pensions are to be paid to, or in respect of. beneficiaries or sub scribers who have objected to transfer are to be determined by rules made by the Secretary of State. It has been explained in previous circulars that, if the numbers objecting were sufficient to offer a prospect of reasonable stability to an independent fund, these rules would be identical in substance with those previously in force, that is to say they would provide for the periodical valuation of the liabilities and the revision, if necessary, of the pensions in accordance with the results shown; but that if those objecting were insufficient for this purpose, the existence of the fund as an independent financial entity would be terminated, and the rules would provide for fixed pensions payable from the revenues of India. It will be seen from the Report that the Actuary considers the numbers sufficient to permit of the continuance of the fund, for the time f) Tv' . r ~2 O being, on a self-supporting basis; and the Secretary of State accordingly proposes, in due course, to make rules reproducing, in all essential details, for this reduced fund, those in force before 1st April, 1937, for the undivided fund It will be necessary to provide in the Rules* for any measures adopted a,s a result of the valuation. It may be recalled that since 1924 the original rates of pension have been increased by 50 per cent. Of this increase part has been expressed, to be temporary, that is to say subject to withdrawals should the condition of the fund, as revealed at a subsequent valuation, make such a course necessary. The policy at successive valua tions has been to apply surpluses to reduce the temporary portion of the increase, in the hope that eventually it would be possible to provide la the Rules for pensions at a full 50 per cent, above the original rates on a permanent basis. After the valuation of 1928 the stabilised portion of the increase had risen to 33^ per cent, or two-thirds of the whole. T^e valuation of 1933 showed that the stabilisation of a further portion was possible, but in view of the uncertainty as to the future of the fund no alteration in the Rules was made. The valuation now under consideration shows a surplus, of £94,990, which it is recommended should be employed in increasing the stabilised portion of the pensions by a further 10 per cent, of the original rates, leaving only per cent, to be continued in tem porary form. Thus of a pension to a widow amounting in all to £450 year, £430 would be permanent and £20 temporary; while of a pension to a child of £150, £143-6-8 would be permanent and £6-13-4 temporary. It is proposed to adopt this recommendation, and the necessary provisions will, subject to any observations which subscribers and beneficiaries may have to make, be embodied in the-new rules. I am to request that any comments or suggestions which you may desire to offer on the above proposals may be despatched so as to reach this Office not later than the 31st Mav, 1939.

The MARQUESS of ZETLAND, P.C., G.C.S.I., G,C,LJi., Secretary of State for India, My Lord Marquess, 1. In compliance with instructions received through the Controller of Pension Funds, I have ^valued the assets and liabilities of the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Scheme as existing at 31st March, 1937. ■ 2. A short explanation, in general terms, of the process of valuation which it has been customary to give in the quinquennial valuation reports, more especially for the benefit of new subscribers, is embodied in the Vppendix. v 3. Past experience affords the only reliable guide as to the assumptions, which are required for the purpose of a valuation and in the case of a Fund of long standing the experience of the Fund itself is naturally^ taken for this purpose. Hence, as a- first step in the work of valuation as at 31st March, 1937, a comparison was made between the experience of the scheme in the 4- years 1933—37 and the ''expectation' resulting from the valuation basis compiled for the valuation at 1928 and usecl, also at the valuation in 1933. The results were necessarily obtained according to age, but their general trend will be sufficiently apparent in the following summary. The figures. given relate to Europeans only. The Asiatic subscribers constitute a small class, not recruited., by new admissions, which has still further-diminished and which, .though included in the valuation, is not of importance in the present connection.

A comparison of this statement with the corresponding statement- given in the report of 1933 indicates that, although the experience of the years 1928—33 was very close to the expected, the experience of the later period was in some respects still closer. The present valuation is of special importance in connexion with the apportionment of the Fund between those members who have transferred their interests to the Com missioners in Britain and those who elected to continue under the old conditions. A further review was therefore made of the combined experience of the last three valuation periods, which served to confirm the suitability of the present basis. It will be remembered that in the report on the valuation at 31st March, 1933, it was stated that a small margin in the basis had produced a profit in the 5 years of about £100,000. In the later period the corresponding profit emerged at about the same rate. These figures are small in relation to the total liabilities and it is apparent that the margin in the basis is no more than may reasonably and properly be retained in a Fund which is self-supporting and in which the effect of any adverse fluctuation would be borne by the members. Thus the actual financial results amply corroborate the statistical conclu sion indicated above. 5. A statement showing the numbers of members (active and retired) and of contingent and incumbent beneficiaries at 1st April, 1933, and of subsequent changes up to 31st March, 1937, is given in Schedule A^. appended. Separate tabulations were made of the numbers on the lattei%. date who have transferred their interests to the Commissioners in Britain and of those who elected to continue under the old conditions. The numbers in the two groups (including Asiatics) and in the various cate gories on 31st March, 1937, were as follows: — Transferred. Untransferred. Total. Subscribers Active — Married . . . . • • . 445 131 576 Unmarried . . . 155 26 181 Retired— Married . . . . 547 76 623 Unmarried ..... 126 6 132 Sons— Incumbent beneficiaries 29 54 83 Contingent beneficiaries (father living) . 599 167 766 Daughters— 134 171 Incumbent beneficiaries 37 Contingent beneficiaries (father living) . 821 187 1,008 Widows— Full pension . . ... 157 91 248 Half pension (re-married) 29 19 48 6. The balance of the Fund on 31st March, 1937, as shown by the printed accounts of the year ending on that date, amounted to £4,410,897. 9:11. There were however certain sums outstanding, which had not been included, but which, since they related to the period prior to 31st March, 1937, must be taken into account in arriving at the apportion ment of the Fund. These sums represented a net credit of £3,281:18:6, of which all but £16:16:1 had been accounted for by 31st March, 1938. The total capital which has to be apportioned between the transferred and untransferred members thus amounts to £4,414,179:8:5-O i. The surplus revealed at the last valuation would have enabled further progress to be made with the stabilization of a portion of the pensions hitherto payable on a temporary basis. But in view of the impending transfer no alteration was made and the pensions continued at the original rates payable from the Fund with: — (a) a permanent addition of 33| per cent, of the full pensions (inclusive of the portion paid by the Government), and (b) a temporary addition of a further 16t per cent, of the full pensions, thus making, for the present, a total increase of 50 per cent, on the original pensions. These benefits are modified in the case of those members who, on retirement from the service under the Premature Retire ment Rules, elected to take either Option A or Option B. 8. The contributions now payable are at a variety of rates, dependent upon the dates of entry of subscribers. Thus, entrants since 31st March, 1928, are paying contributions 12% per cent, in excess of the original basic rates, other groups are paying basic rates, 121 pfer cent, less than basic rates and 25 per cent, less ihan basic rates. «■» 9. The rates of pension and contributions indicated above have been ^ aken into account in the calculations, for which purpose it has been assumed that the temporary addition to pensions would be continued up to 31st December, 1939. In accordance with instructions^ the rate of 4 per cent, has been adopted as the interest basis for the purpose of ascertaining the position of the Fund, on the assumption that the present arrangements continue Result of the valuation of the. Fund as a whole. 10. The result of the valuation, of which details are given in Schedule B appended, is as follows:—• Present value of— Contingent pensions ...... Immediate pensions ...... Total liabilities Present value of future contributions and donations . Net liability Capital Surplus £ 2,904,540 1,686,760 4,691,300 613,066 3,978,234 4,414,179' 435,945. I 1 The last valuation revealed a surplus of £325,768 and it was stated in the report on that valuation that this surplus was sufficient to permit of an increase in the permanent pension of 8^- per cent, on the original rates. For reasons set out in paragraph 9 of Circular No. A.G.-2249/36 of 22nd April, 1936, it was felt that practical considerations rendered it necessary to postpone the stabilizing of any further portion of the pension.As a consequence, the temporary increase of 16f per cent, was continued, and it has been assumed for present purposes that this increase will continue up to 31st December, 1939; the effect of this has. been to absorb '£82,000 of the surplus disclosed by the 1933 valuation, leaving £243,768 carried forward. During the 4 years ended on the valuation date, this sum has been increased by £192,177 to £435,945. Approximately 60 per cent, of the increase has been due to interest on the surplus carried forward, interest on the Fund in excess of 4 per cent, up to 31st December, 1934, ^and late notifications of marriages of daughters in the preceding valuation period, all of which are in the nature of non-recurring profit^. The balance represents the result of deviations from the assumed basis which have already been referred to. in paragraph 4. - 11. Had the fund continued as an undivided entity the additional surplus which, has how emerged would have permitted the stabilization of -a somewhat larger proportion of the permanent increase in benefits than that recommended after the valuation of 1933, together with the maintenance for a further period of the full increase of 50 per cent In the absence of any adverse fluctuations it could reasonably have been anticipated that; with the continuance of the small profits from miscel laneous sources ; the relatively small increase in pensions which would .still have remained on a temporary basis would probably have been stabiliz ed in the not distant future. ■ ■ Apportionment of the Fund. 12. In view of the, fact that ..the Fund has now to be apportioned. It is 'essential that a strictly appropriate share of the Fund, including the surplus, should be transferred to the Commissioners,' arid since in the past it has , been the practice to allot a common percentage increase in pensions without distinction as to age or class, it would appear that the -most suitable manner in which to distribute'the surplus is to apply the whole of it by way of a hypothetical uniform increase to the permanent scale of benefits. On this basis the apportionment of the total Fund as at 31st March, 1937, is as follows: — Transferred members ... . . . . £3,384,410 : 7 : 5 Untransferred members ....... £1,029,769 : 1 : 0 Total Fund . £4,414,179 : 8 : 5 The total amount to be transferred to the Commissioners as at 31st March, 1937, is thus £3,384,410:7:5. It is to be noted that, in arriving at these figures, allowance has been made for all sums which were outstanding on 31st March, 1937, and that the related payments and receipts after that date should be debited or credited as the case may be to the Indian Government. 13.

T he P rocess of V aluation, For the information of those who are not familiar with the process of valuation, the following paragraphs indicate briefly what is the nature of this process, particularly in regard to the undertakings of widows' and orphans' pension schemes. An actuarial valuation consists of an estimation of the present value, on the one hand, of the benefits conferred by the Eund and, on the other hand, of the contributions payable in future, the difference between the two sums being the 'net liability' against which assets accumulated out of past contributions (with interest) should be in hand. The comparison then made between the net liability and the actual assets in hand (repre sented by the balance at credit of the scheme on the valuation date) determines whether the Fund is solvent, and where the assets are the greater of the two amounts the difference represents the amount of the surplus. In estimating the present value of the future benefits and con tributions, it is necessary to have regard to a variety of contingencies, mcl ng mortality rates expected to prevail among the subscribers, wives ( or widows) and their children, the probable marriages and remarriages among subscribers, marriages of daughters and remarriages y of w'dows, the probable number of births of children of each sex to subscribers, retirements of subscribers and the rate of interest at which it is assumed that the accumulating funds can be invested. Apart from the rate of interest, all of these elements vary with the ages through which the persons concerned will pass in the future, and at each stage of the calculations appropriate assumptions must be made as to the conditions prevailing during the long period which must elapse until the death of the last surviving beneficiary under engagements entered into with present or former subscribers. These engagements may extend over very many years; to take a simple example, an officer entering at the age of 24 (which is about the average age at entry) may not marry until he is 40 and may leave at his death a spinster daughter bom when he was 44 and who lives unmarried and therefore a pensioner to the age of 80 4s she was not born until 20 years after her father joined the Service the contract, beginning first with contributions from the member and later taking the form of a pension to the daughter, will have extended over 100 years. The valuation does not take account of the engagements in respect of officers entering the Service after the date as at which the valuation as made. OIPD—L397 HD—13-2-39—3,000,A. G. 14709/38.

Indian Civil Service Family Pension Scheme Untransfcrred Section. My Lord Marquess, 1. In my report on the valuation as at 31st March 1937, of the Indian •Civil Service Family Pension Scheme, I showed that the amount of the fund applicable to those subscribers and beneficiaries who elected to -continue under existing conditions was £l,02 i 9,769-l-0. 2. The valuation, at 4 per cent, interest, of the assets and liabilities in respect of these members, and the position of the untransferred fund, is shown in the following statement corresponding to that given in para- .graph 10 of my report on the valuation of the whole fund. £ Present value of— Contingent pensions Immediate pensions Total liabilities Present value of future contributions and donations Net liability Capital ......... Surplus 482,752 673,684 1,056,436 121,657 934,779 1,029,769 94,990 3. The allocation of this surplus on the lines adopted in previous -valuations of the whole fund gives the following results: — A. Increase of stabilized addition to the pensions from 33| £ per cent, to 43J per cent. ...... 74,010 B. Provision of a further 6f per cent, for the 5 years ending 31st December, 1944 ........ 11,490 Total . 85,500 The balance of surplus to be carried forward amounts to £9,490. 4 While therefore the present position is broadly the same as that indicated in paragraph 11 of my report on the valuation of the whole fund, it would appear that the substantially reduced membership consequent / v'ij- u■J** 1 *-' c upon the transfer, which moreover will not be recruited by new entrants r has introduced greater scope for fluctuations in experience. The point is of importance in connexion with the prospective maintenance of the full increase of 50 per cent, in benefits and it must be recognized that a greater degree of caution will have to be exercised when extending the permanent commitments of the Fund, 5. The future is somewhat less secure, but the numbers remaining in the untransferred section and the related resources are sufficient to enable the Fund to continue on a self-supporting basis, for some time at any rate, and there is no present necessity for the Government to take over the Fund and guarantee the benefits on the lines suggested in the circular letter dated 15th March, 1935. Since, however, there will be no new entrants, the membership will diminish, and it is evident that the stage will be reached, possibly within the next 15 years, when the Fund wilt no longer be able to maintain an independent existence on a stable basis.

GOVERNMENT ACTUARY'S DEPARTMENT, 20, Geeat Smith Steeet, LONDON, S. W. 1. 31st January, 1939. The Most Honoubable the MARQUESS of ZETLAND, P.O., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., Seceetaey op State foe India, -v India Office, Whitehall, S. W. 1. My Loed Maequess, 1. In compliance with instructions received through the Controller of Pension Funds, I have valued the assets and liabilities of the Superior Services (India) Family Pension Fund as existing on 31st March, 1937. 2. The short explanation, in general terms, of the process of valuation which was included m the first valuation report, and which may usefully he repeated, more especially for the benefit of new subscribers, is embodied in the Appendix. 3. The past experience of the Fund itself affords the most reliable guide to the assumptions which are required for the purposes of the valuation, and as a first step in the present investigation the experience of the Fund for the period 1st April, 1934 to 31st March 1937, was compared with the £ exnecta- tion ' resulting from the basis adopted in the construction of the scales of con tribution. This comparison showed that the number of subscribers who died during the period was greater, and the number of wives who died was less than the corresponding numbers expected. As regards the other elements entering into the valuation, it was found that the actual experience was in close accord with the expectation. 4. It will be recollected that, in the report on the valuation of the Fund as at 31st March 1934, it was stated that the mortality of subscribers in the period from the inception of the Fund up to that date had been heavy. In view of the facts that this unfavourable experience has continued, and that the mortality of wives has tended to be lighter than anticipated, which also has an adverse effect on the finances of the Fund, I have deemed it advisable to revise the valuation basis for the purpose of the present investigation. A new series of valuation tables has accordingly been compiled, based as far as possible upon the actual experience of the Fund. Recourse was had to the experience of other similar Funds for guidance in certain respects, where, ov/ing to theimmaturity of the Fund, the experience (of particular importance in the case of incumbent widows) was insufficient or lacking. In the original basis on which the scales of contributions were assessed an addition of 5 per cent, for contingencies was made. The need for this has been proved by experience, and the revised basis has fully absorbed the margin originally included. The effect of the new basis of valuation is to place a higher value on the estimated liabilities as a whole, although, as compared with the original basis, the change has had no appreciable effect at the younger ages. 5, A statement showing the number of members and beneficiaries of the Fund on 1st April, 1934, and the subsequent changes up to 31st March, 1937, is given in Schedule A attached. Separate tabulations were made of the numbers on this date who have transferred their interests to the Commissioners in Great Britain and of those who elected to continue under the old conditions. In the Voluntary Section the figures (except as regards incumbent beneficiaries) relate to contracts and not to individuals. The numbers in the two groups and in the various categories on 31st March, 1937, were as follows Voluntary Section — Transferred. Untransferrod. Contracts for widows'benefits ... 521 119 . Contracts for children's benefits to age 21— (а) sons 311 78 (б) daughters . . . . • 235 54 Contracts for daughters'benefits till marriage . 117 18 Total number of contracts for contingent benefits Incumbent Beneficiaries— Numter of widows ....

Number of daughters—benefits to marriage 1,184 267 37 24 10 8 4 12 8 5 59 49 In addition, there was one transferred re-married widow whose pension (£300) was suspended during the continuance of her later marriage. Compulsory Section— Number of Subscribers—married ... 45 0 Number of Subscribers—unmarried . . 100 13 Number of contingent beneficiary children— Sons ....... 15 1 Daughters ... ... 12 7 6. The balance of the Fund on 31st March, 1937, as shown by the printed accounts of the year ending on that date, amounted to £624,987 : 4 : 1. There were, however, certain sums outstanding, the most important of which were the pensions due on 1st April, 1937, which had not been included in the account but which, since they related to the period prior to 1st April, 1937, must be allowed for in arriving at the apportionment of the fund. These sums re-- presented a net debit of £2,023 :5 : 11. The total capital which has to be apportioned between the transferred and untransferred members thus amounts to £022,063 : 18 : 2,Result of the valuation of the Fund as a whole. 7. In accordance with instructions, the rate of 4 per cent, has been adopted as the interest basis for the purpose of ascertaining the position of the Fund on the assumption that the old arrangements under which the balance at credit of the Fund remained in the hands of the Government of India would continue. The result of the valuation, of which details are given in Schedule B appended, is as follows :— Voluntary Section— Present value of immediate pensions Present value of contingent pensions Present value of future contributions Not liability Compulsory Section. Total net liability Amount of the Fund Net liability Deficiency [£ £ 187.543 518,912 706,455 104.459 601,996 21,213 623 209 622,964 245 The last valuation revealed a surplus of £34,739, over one-half of which as attributable to interest received in excess of the equivalent of 4 per cent. jk&gt;er annum. The surplus, with accumulations of interest at 4 per cent., would have amounted to approximately £39,000 on 31st March, 1937. The absorp tion of this surplus has been due to the heavy mortality of subscribers and the change in the valuation basis referred to in paragraph 4. The result of the present valuation is to show an approximate balance between the assets and liabilities. The nominal deficiency of £245 will not have any appreciable effect on the benefits payable and may be carried forward. Apportionment of the Fund. 8. The Fund has been apportioned in proportion to the net liabilities per taining to the transferred and untransferred members after making the neces sary ad j ustment to the liabilities to allow for the respective shares of the small deficiency shown by the valuation. On this basis the apportionment of the total Fund at 31st March, 1937 is as follows :— Tansferrcd members Untransferred members Total Fund £ e. d. i57,722 17 5 165,241 0 9 622.963 18 2 The total amount to be transferred to the Commissioners at 31st March, 1937, is thus £457,722 : 17 ; 5. It is to be noted that in arriving at these figures allowance has been made for all sums which were outstanding on 3l3t March, 1937, and that the related payments and receipts after that date should be debited or credited as the case may be to the Indian Government. 9. I propose to submit, in due course, separate reports dealing with the future position of the transferred and untransferred sections. I am, my Lord Maequess, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) G. S. W. EPPS. r' W:S7C 5 APPENDIX. The Process of Valuation. An actuarial valuation consists of an estimation of the present value, on the one hand, of the benefits conferred by the Fund, and on the other hand, of tho contributions payable in future, the difference between the two sums being the ' net liability ' against which assets accumulated out of past contributions should be in hand. The comparison then made between the net liability of the Fund and the actual assets in hand determines whether the Fund is solvent, and where the assets are the greater of the two amounts the-difference represents the amount of the surplus. In estimating the present value of tha_ future benefits and contributions, it is necessary to have regard to a variety of contingencies including the mortality rates expected to prevail among the subscribers, their wives (or widows) and their children, marriages of daughters and re-marriages of widows, and, in the case of compulsory subscribers the probable marriages among unmarried subscribers, the probable number and ages of children left by the subscribers at their death, retirements of subscribers, and the rate of interest at which it is assumed the accumulating funds can be invested. Apart from the rate of interest, all of these elements vary with the ages through which the persons concerned will pass in future, and at each stage in the calculations appro• pria,te assumptions must be made as to the conditions prevailing during the long period which must elapse until the death of the last surviving beneficiary under engagements entered into with present or former subscribers. These engagements may extend over very many years; to take a simple—and not extreme—example, an officer entering the compulsory section at the age of 21 (which is about the average age at entry) may not marry intil he is approaching age 40, and may leave at his death a spinster daughter born when he was 41 and who lives unmarried and therefore a pensioner until the age of 80. A.s she was not bom until 20 years after her father joined the Service the contract, beginning with contributions from the subscriber and later taking the form of a pension to the daughter, will have extended over 100 years. The valuation does not take account of the engagements of officers entering the Service after the date as at which the valuation is made.2921/39;' March, 1939: Superior Services {India) Family Pension Fund. Sie/Madam, I am directed to forward for your information a copy of a Report by Mr. G. S. W. Epps, C.B., C.B.E., the Government Actuary, on the valuation ot the Superior Services (India) Family Pension Fund as at 31st March, 1937, and on the assessment :of the portions of the Fund attributable respectively to sub scribers and beneficiaries who have assented to the transfer of their interests to Commissioners in this country and to those who have objected to transfer. It will be seen that the sum to be transferred to the Commissioners by the end of March, 1939, as at 31st March, 1937, is £457,722 : 17 : 5, to which there will of course be added the amount by which receipts from subscriptions and donations; during the two years 1st April, 1937-^31st March, 1939, together with interest, on the balances remaining in the hands of the Government of India, exceed the payments of pension during that period. It may be observed that whereas Section 273 of the Government of India Act/ and the Order in Council made under that Section, direct the transfer of the balance of the Fund as at 31st March, 1936, subject to the retention of such portion as represented at that date the interests of the objectors, the valuation of the respective interests has in practice been carried out as at 31st March, 1937.- In view of the fact that it was impracticable to obtain the decisions of the various -subscribers and beneficiaries affected before the latter date this procedure has been adopted as being the only method available in practice of carrying out the intentions of the Act. In view, however, of the modification of the procedure laid down by or under the Act, H. M. Government propose at an early date to lay before Parliament an amendment of the Act substituting the date 31st March, 1937, for that of 31st March, 1936. This change will not affect the decision that sums due to be handed over to the Commissioners should be so handed over by 31st March, 1939. A report on the valuation of the transferred fund, indicating the rates of pension which it is estimated that the fund will be adequate to provide, will be circulated at tlie earliest practicable date. # lam, Your obedient Servant, SIDNEY TURNER, Controller of Pension Funds.

Department letter ibruary 1940.) a Vo$ India Office, Whitehall, London, S. W.-l. 1st December, 1939. Indian Civil Service Family Pension Fund. Sir, I am directed to refer to the circular letter from this Office of May, 1939, No. A. G.-4609/39, forwarding a Report dated 30th March by the Government Actuary as to the rates of pension which cguld be paid in the Transferred section of the Fund, and proposing that provision for payment of pension at these rates should in due course be embodied in the Rules. As the response to the Circular appears to indicate general acceptance of this proposal, the necessary amendments to the Rules have been made by the Secretary of State. It has been necessary, in connection with the revision of the pension scales, to consider the provisions under which subscribers are at present permitted to secure supplementary pensions for their dependants by the pay ment of special contributions. The amount of the benefits which may be so secured is subject to fixed limits, which were arrived at by deducting from the rates of pension ruling before the division of the Fund the rates which it was estimated by the Actuary, in 1936, would be payable in the Transferred section. As the rates recommended in the Actuary's later report, and now embodied in the Rules, are appreciably higher than those foreshadowed in 1936, it has been possible for subscribers, who have taken full advantage of the facilities offered, to obtain for their dependants pensions in excess of the amounts available in the undivided Fund. The Secretary of State has considered, therefore, whether the limits should be reduced; but he has decided to make no amendment, for the time being, in the provisions relating to these supplementary pensions. He will, however, consider, on the occasion of the next valuation, the desirability of submitting for the views of subscribers proposals for the discontinuance or modification of these provisions, without prejudice to the position of those who may have availed themselves of them by that date. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, SIDNEY TURNER, Controller of Pension Funds. l298 hd . IINDIAN CIVIL SERVICE FAMILY PENSION FUND (TRANSFERRED). SCHEDULE OF TRUST ASSETS AS AT 31 st MARCH 1939.

D.S./25.S.47.'\t - letter No, 1 jthe 9th 1947, th0 ciu^f Secretary to the^^^L^?'. »o ' 0 ssjr'' 0 th0 Oo, ' r - &lt; '' t »' toai*. H «.r ■*****'• fsssa&amp;ss^ eiv11 • • • • ■ t I am directed to state that a case has come to the notice of this Government in which the application of the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Fund Rules, strictly according to the present terms of Part B of the 7th Schedule to the rules might cause hardship to the beneficiary. 2. The scale of pension payable to a fatherless male child under this Schedule varies according to the mother being alive or not. If the mother is living, the child is entitled, on the death of the father, to an annual pension of £33-15-0 until the age of 6 years, to a pension of £ 67-10 from the age of 6 to the age of 12 years, and to a pension of £ 135 from the age of 12 years, onwards. If the child has lost both parents, it gets a pension of £ 135 at all ages, upto the age of 24. If the child is entitled to pension and is drawing a pension at a rate lower than £ 135 on. the date of the mother's death, it is entitled to the enhanced pension with effect from the .date following the mother T s death, 3. The diff: rence: in scale is clearly based on the ccnsidu: ition that the mother if alive as widow of an Indian Civil Service Offi^pr, is also entitled to pension and as the financial requifements for the maintenance and education of the child^arg not so great up to the age of 12 years as thereafter, the pension drawn by the mother no doubt taken into account in framing the scale for the child f s pension. .'.he rules and Schedules do not make special provision for t he case of a male child whose father had divorced the mother and whose mother had then remarried. In such an instance, Contd.., \the mother has no claim to pension from the Fund, an« at the same time the child cannot before the, age of 12 years draw a pension at the enhanced rates of £ 135 until the mother dies, according to the terms of the rules and schedules. The circumstances involved in this particular case that A an English Indian Civil Service Officer divorced his wife and was granted judicially sole scale custody of the only child of the marriage, a boy. The mother has remarried, and all communication between her and and his child, has ceased. A has made testamentary disposition for the guardianship of the boy by his relatives, in the sevent of his health. 'A' has not himself remarried, Tha child is now iour years of age, but should -A' die, still unmarried, before the boy reaches the ago of 12 years, the latter will draw pension only at the lower rates of 33-15 and £ 67-10 upto the age of 12 even although the mother, still alive in the technical sense as far as the child is concerned, is in no way responsible for him financially or otherwise. The case is perhaps exceptional and in order to redress an inequity which might be occasioned to the child. I am to request you to approach the Secretary of State to consider the advisibility of making an amendment to these rules, in such a manner that no hardship is caused in the case of the child under reference. from thp C Inrt- 0f n™~! r ^ 0 * A - G *6765/47. dated the 18th June 1947, om the Indxc. fice, London, to the Finance Department, New Delhi Subject:- Indian Civil Service Family.Pension Fund. I am directed to inform you that your letter of the 29th April, 1947, No. F. 30(3)-Est.V/47, forwarding a letter from the Government of the Punjab, has been submitted to Contd.-3- the Secretary of State who has decided that^ there is no need to amend the Rules of the above Fund in order 'fco provide for what the Government of the Punjab admit ara likely to be exceptional cases. The Rula as It now stands authorises payment of pension at the higher ratve to an orphan who has lost both parents. The Secretary of State would regard the case of an orphan whose mother had no longer any financial responsibility for his upbringing as covered by this Rule and would be prepared accordingly to authorize payment of the higher appropriate rate of pension with effect from the date of the fathers death. \&lt;$- D.S./25.8.47.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000b0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1441</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000b0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1441</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 15/6 Rules &amp; Regulations (1) I.C.S.
