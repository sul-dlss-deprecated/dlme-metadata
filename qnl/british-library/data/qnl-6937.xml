MESOPOTAMIA. Administrative Record during British Occupation. (Memorandum by Political Department, India Office.) 1. Introductory. —The country to be attacked by the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force which left India in the autumn of 1914 was hostile to its Turkish masters. There was a certainty that if our operations were successful the Arabs would detach themselves from the Tinks , there was a hope that they would attach themselves to us. Accordingly, Sir Percy Cox, who by many j^ears of service in the Persian Gulf had acquired a unique position and reputation in these regions, was appointed Chief Political Officer on the Staff of the General Officer Commanding. On him devolved the solution of the political, administrative and diplomatic problems which resulted from the progress of the Army, Prior 10 the occupation of Baghdad, Sir P. Cox conducted his correspondence exclusively through the General Officer Commanding ; in August 1917 he was given the title of ' Civil Commissioner ' and was authorised to report direct to His Majesty's Government, addressing his communications to the Secretary of State for India. 2. Military Situation. —As operations progressed, the military map of Mesopotamia showed a base at Basra, a long thin line of communications on the Shatt-al-Arab to Kurna, and thence up the Euphrates to Nasiriyah, and up the Tigris to Ivut. At a later phase the Tigris line extended to Samarra with outposts at Falujah on the west and Baqubah on the east, but for many months after the fall of Baghdad there were no troops on the Euphrates between the Hindiyah barrage and Nasiriyah. The Arab is a notorious marauder, and it was the policy of the Turk to make him harass our flanks and embarrass our convoys. It was the work of Sir Percy Cox to persuade him to good behaviour and gradually to attract the Shaikhs and the cultivators to an active appreciation of Western administration. Shortly after our arrival in Baghdad deputations arrived from the Euphrates begging the presence of a British representative for the maintenance of inter-tribal order and the visible guarantee of authority. In the Basra Vilayet districts were formed and were peacefully running while the fighting before Kut was still in progress ; within four months of the occupation of Baghdad the whole of the surrounding country was under control, representatives of Government—in four instances Arabs—were established in district headquarters, and the tribes, many of whom were still armed with British rifles and British ammunition, spoils of Ctesiphon, were back on their canals busy with the coming harvest. As our sphere of influence extended, contact was established with Kurdistan and Persia, with the Arab of the desert and the Arab 'of the Peninsula, and to Baghdad were attracted the refugee Armenians of Van, Assyrians from Julamerk and Chaldeans from Urmiah and Salinas, 50,000 in all, the feeding and con tentment oP whom has been an added care. 3. Early administrative Problems. —The administrative problem had two aspects, rural and urban ; and the problem of the town was the more difficult. The machinery of Govern ment had been Turkish, the towns were cosmopolitan. In Basra even before the war the rupee was more current than the piastre ; in Kerbala Persian and Hindustani were better understood than Turkish; the population of Baghdad contained. Syrians, Armenians, Chaldeans, Indians and Persians, French nuns and Jewish rabbis. The townsfolk, even the villagers, considered themselves distincl from and superior to the mere 'Arab' of the countryside and desert. The personnel of the Ottoman Government invariably fled on our approach, and except at Basra were careful to remove or destroy all records. But the townsfolk expected government. On our entry into Basra, the date harvest had to be collected and disposed of ; revenue charges were due. Customs dues awaited collection, litigation awaited settlement, property changed hands and legal sanction was required. 4. Machinery of Government. —To assist Sir Percy Cox, Mr. H. Dobbs, I.C.S., was sent out in January 1915 as Revenue Commissioner. He found that in the Basra vilayet the land revenue demand was for the most part fixed, and other taxes collected by farmers. He made such alterations in the contracts as equity demanded, but generally speaking maintained the previous system. He was fortunate in finding the demand registers intact. Waqf property was regulated, an education policy framed, and the work of administration was gradually crystallised. He left in 1916 and was eventually succeeded by a Revenue Board of two officers who assumed under Sir Percy Cox control of Land Registration, Land Revenue, Land Settlement, Customs, Excise, Miscellaneous Revenues, Public Debt and Waqf. To these was added the duty of Legal Remembrancer. s 50 100 8/19 a9 n l f, u . nrictiral purposes split into two.

Political officers, sent o 51^^tad^u'tners of former Turkish districts, as the field, were left to open political at visiUM | 1 u- the revenue officer, who ascertained the army advanced beyond them. I hey \ , liaile ' . ovisiima l arrangements for revenue agricultural requirements ot e ; m ' j ,.^1,,,,,, were submitted for the Civil Cominis- establishment and collections. I ^ 0 .^ n ' P(ldeil n ormallv. Thus, for example, though sioners orders and \ n ' f 'Y ve^vUhin three hours ot the occupation ot Kirkuk an effective the Turkish olhcials ha n ( i avs revenue collections were proceeding, arrange- nlttrV —^n &lt;d agriculture were in train, and even an orphanage had been established. This was but one of many instances. 6. Considered departmentally the activities of the Civil Commissioner and his staff may be ciimmarised under the following heads :— m' VMlkd -The Arabs ot Mesopotamia, hostile' to Turkish rule, are content under (i) /oi ^ a ; 1 • • tnlti()n The t.-ibes beyond Mesopotamia, Arab and Kurd, are in , friendly relationship, while the growing prosperity of Mesopotamia and the opening up of communications h; s exerted a favourable influence on affaiih m the neighbouring districts of Persia. (ii) Land Revenue and Agriculture. —While we were still in Basra small agricultunil loans were made to the Shaikhs of agricultural tribes. W ithm four months ..1 th, occupation of Baghdad, our influence was extended to the cereal-gr..u mg counti&gt; on either flank, and a scheme was put forward, sanctioned, and carried tinong i whereby by close co-ordination of military and civil resources over 1'Kl canals were restored to efficiency, nearly 7,000 tons of seed, and _0,O( )Z. of cash wcu distributed as advances; 'the staff—almost entirely local-necessary to supervise and account for the detailed transactions was collected and trained, and two new canals with a command of 1(K),(K)() acres, designed by W illcocks, were constructed As a result, tlie country, which the year before was restless and in the grip ol famine, not only required no imports, but produced a surplus suthcumt ioi the increased population attracted from starving Turkey and Persia, loi the 'O refugees at Baqubah, and for the supply to the army of corn, which by the end of 1918 had amounted to over 50,tMK) tons. Wheat and barley sold in 11)1/ .it from-401. to 1001. a ton. The present price is from 5/ to 10/. At a cost ol 21,0001. the scheme .produced crops worth over 2,000,(KK)/. The development scheme of 1917-18 was followed in the ensuing year by the formation of a Board of Agriculture, the establishment of an agricultural and an irrigation directorate, and the co-ordination of all activities directed towards the increase of the food supply. Two new canals have been established and colonised, and new head- works provided for the most important canal (the KhaJis) on the Diyalah river, which, thanks to Turkish neglect, was threatened with complete destruction. Uiver protection work has been such that never in the history of Baghdad have lloods oi equal severity proved so harmless. In all this there has been the closest co-operation between the military and political authorities. • (iii) ('ustoms, Excise and other Taxes. —It has been found necessary to abandon certain of the justly unpopular Turkish taxes—in particular the poll tax for roads, war taxes, and in certain areas the salt tax. The provision of international law to the effect that the fiscal policy of an occupied country must be maintained, has been scrupulously observed. Sea customs have proved a profitable source of revenue from the first ; and land customs on Persian trade are duly levied. The rights of the bondholders of the Ottoman debt have not been neglected ; and though it was impossible to permit the debt with its central ollices at Constantinople to continue3 to function, its revenues have been collected and in many cases exmnrUl separate accounts carefully kept. expanded, and av) , tlle advance from Kut civil justice was administered by a Court in wlncli m cm matters applied regulations based on Indian law or personal law of the litigants, and in revenue and fiscal ma' i ^ Ottoman code des terres Crimes were dealt wi h followed the governors or political officers ; and in tribal cases a regnlatkni teseTon ^Indhn Sr a 7tt at ' n pr cZn ^ anC r a --ttr^mall ^r followed in 10IS } v r f p ® S court were 0 Pened in 1917; vMln f rul i } Courts i of First Instance and a Court of Appeal In this vilayet Ottoman law was applied from the first, and steps have since been taken to assimilate the legal system of Basra to that of Baghdad Anh imlar^ ' mated with tbeir British colleagues m all the' Meiplmiaf til cfurte Xt dency of antrab judge ^ thrOU « hout bee ' P 1 ^ the sole presi: stand,ud aie available. Of 80 ex-Turkish schoolmasters who applied for posts at Baghdad only five were found suitable.

A self-supwrtinL iom memal school is proving most popular. The Boy Scouts movement has been started, and promises success.

(x) Surveys.-—A commencement was made with the training of staff on the first occupation ol Baghdad. Mr. Glass, of tlie Survey of India, has laid out several rectangles, and it is hoped to avoid the multiplication of departmental surveyors which obtains m India, by forming a survey department to fix points within which cadastral surveys sufficient for all purposes can be completed by a less highly trained staff. (xi) Archaiology. -Precautions have been taken to preserve sites and maintain Govern ment rights m antiques discovered. Under the auspices of experts certain works 0 researc. ). have ])een undertaken. Mosques and other historical relics, neglected or damaged under 1 urkish rule, have been repaired and restored. Every care has been taken to prevent antic|uities leaving the country. (xii) Finance.—-Vv hile active operations continued the more important services were necessarily of a military character, and their cost was borne by military funds. 1 he accounts of the civil administration were able to show a'profit, and the S 50 Commissioner s budget for the current year, of which we have received only a brief telegraphic summary, shows a deficit of 42^,000Z.; but it is to be noted that of the total estimated expenditure (3,330,OOW.) a sum of 753,000?. is entered on account of public works and irrigation, a considerable proportion of which iy ' A 2 Stdoubtless to follows:— Receipts.

The people had been assured the country would not revert to Turkish rule, and thev took it for granted that they would remain under British protection. They had seen our work in battle and in administration ; they appreciated our thoroughness, our strict justice, -ind above all, our rapidity of action. Since the armistice the position has not improved. 1 he delavs and uncertainties of the Peace Conference have had their inevitable reaction upon local opinion. Distrust of our intentions and fear of the return of the Turk have been engendered. For reasons which need not be discussed here, it was considered necessary to invite the population of Mesopotamia to express their views on 'self-determination.' They reflected that if they voted for the Turk and the British came, they would be none the worse ; whereas if they voted for the British and the Turk came, they would inevitably pay the penalty. Their open declarations in our favour were therefore the result of stable conviction. The continued postponement of a decision gives endless opportunity for agitation, while it necessarily tries the patience of our friends. Arab hopes and fears in Syria also have had their influence on Mesopotamia!! politics The results are to be seen not only in signs of unrest in the interior of the country, but in actual disturbances in the outlying districts, particularly in Kurdish areas, where no less than three incidents involving the murder of British otlicers have recently occurred. At the same time material progress on the previous scale has become impossible; and both the Agricultural and Irrigation Departments are depleted of officers who cannot afford to abandon the certainty of good employment elsewhere for the doubtful prospects which are all that Mesopotamia can at present hold out. Already men of excep tional experience have been lost to the country; Col. G arrow has gone to the Argentine, Col. Evans to Burma, and Col. Engledow to England. 8. There is also the financial aspect. We are at present bound to accept Turkish fiscal policy, and a financial system which requires complete reform has to be made to serve. We cannot inaugurate new taxes; we have had to abandon old ones. Mesopotamia is to all practical intents and purposes a separate State; yet a proposal by the Civil Commis sioner to introduce a Customs barrier against the Syrian frontier has had to be negatived. Other sources of revenue that await exploitation, e.g., rise in land values, minerals and lease of State lands, must remain untouched. The longer the delay the greater the political and financial embarrassment. 9' ^ few remarks may be added as to the position of the India OlFice in relation to the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia. The circumstances in which the Chief Political Officer with the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force was accorded the title of 44 Civil Commissioner ' Q? f f 1 i e T \ a - of 1 (llre(,tcorres P on( l eilce with I lis Majesty's Government, through the Secretary of fnfrnlnl liave been mentioned in an earlier paragraph. This arrangement, which was l tl fl gU t • . ' , ^ een rualntaln0 ^ down to the picscnt time. The India Ollice Ihi «^K^V nS ^ nCe 7 ■ recommendations, Ac. from the Civil Commis sioner, while the instructions of His Majesty s Government (on other than military matters)have invariably issued in the name of the Secretary of State for India. The latter lias throughout acted in the closest possible co-operation with the Foreign Office and War Office while on all questions of high policy reference has been made to the Eastern Committee 1 of the War Cabinet., But the India Office has been, and still is, the Department primarilv responsible. The supervision of the Secretary of State for India in matters of policy is exeicised direct, and not through the Government of India, though the latter are kept regularly () ^ passes, and are consulted in every case where Indian interests are specialty aftected or where the advice and experience of the Indian authorities are likely to be of value to His Majesty's Government, In matters other than those of policy, e.g., the auditing of accounts, the supply of material, the grant of local allowances and so forth, the supervision oi the Government of India, subject to the ultimate authority of the Secretary of State, is still maintained. The task of meeting the requirements of the civil administration, as well as the military needs of the army of occupation, has throughout imposed a severe strain upon the resources of India, both in man-power and material. . 10. The present arrangements are essentially of a provisional character. Introduced at a period when military requirements far outweighed political and administrative considerations, they have survived into a time when the civil, as against the military, aspect of the local' administration has necessarily become more and more pronounced It may be recalled that Baghdad has now been in British occupation for nearly 2^ years, and Basra for little short of five years. The task of supervising the civil administration has enormously increased, and is rapidly outgrowing the powers Of the small staff of the India Office Political Department (which has to deal simultaneously with such questions as Persia, Arabia, Afghanistan, Tibet, and the Indian Native States) to handle with the requisite degree of efficiency, while there are no signs of the creation of the new Department of State which it has been proposed should take over the Middle East. So long as the future of Mesopotamia hangs in the balance awaiting the decision of the Peace Conference, it may be held that the moment for a change of system has not arrived ; but that the present arrangements cannot be maintained indefinitely is a proposition that scarcely admits of dispute, though India's interest— historical, religious, and commercial—in Mesopotamia will always give the India Office a claim to be consulted. Political Department, India Office, 20th August 1919. 1 An informal Committee (known as the Mesopotamia Administration Committee) was first appointed in March 1917 to deal with the problems arising out of the occupation of Baghdad. The functions of this Committee were subsequently enlarged and its name changed to ' Middle Bast Committee.' Later, the whole position was regularised, and the Committee was reconstituted by order of the War Cabinet, under the title ' Eastern Committee.' The Eastern Committee was dissolved in January 1919, but its functions are to a great extent carried on by an Inter-Departmental Committee on Eastern Affairs, which meets from time to 'time at the Foreign Office. Lord Curzon has been the Chairman of all these Committees.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000322_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B328</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000322</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B328</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Mesopotamia.
