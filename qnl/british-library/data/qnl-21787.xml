To The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah. Memorandum V I enclose herewith a copy of a letter which I have written to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain on the subject of trading with enemy firms in neutral countries. 2. So far as the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms are concerned it seems highly improbable that merchants of any Sheikhdom except possibly Dubai and perhaps Sharjah transact business with firms in neutral countries. My information regarding the extent of trade between say Dubai and any neutral country is somewhat inadequate and I should be glad to have your opinion (after consultation with the Residency Agent) whether it is necessary or desirable for any similar approach to be made to the Shaikh of Dubai and or any of the others. 3. I enclose for your information a copy of the latest schedule to the Enemy (Specified Persons) Order so that you can see a representative selection of firms with whom trading is prohibited.

This Order may be cited as the Bahrain Trading % with the Enemy (Custodian) Order, 1939. It shall be published by the Political Agent, Bahrain, and shall come into force with rom the date of such publication. Dated the 1st December,1939 Political Resident in the Persian GulfSecret. Circular E.W \ ( 5 ) Ministry of Economic Warfare, October VI, 1939. y\ i « Statutory and Black Lists. Sir, I AM directed by the Minister for Economic Warfare to inform you that the Black List Committee are considering what general principles should guide them in recommending the inclusion of a tirm or firms in the Statutory and Black Lists. ‘ 2 . The Committee have agreed that for the present they should be guided by the principles outlined in the enclosed memorandum, which are mainly based on the practice of the Black List Committee in the last war. 3. Your particular attention is drawn to paragraph 5 of the memo randum, in which it is stated that “no firm should be included in the Statutory List or the Black List unless there is reason to believe that its inclusion will damage the Allies less than it will damage the enemy.” 4. The Committee will not normally recommend the inclusion of any firm in either list unless they know whether or not the firm in question handles an appreciable amount of British trade, or whether, as in the case of a public utility company, its functions are so closely connected with British firms or interests that to prohibit or impede intercourse between it and British subjects might react to our own disadvantage. When making a recommendation, the adoption of which would close a channel of trade hitherto used by British traders, you should, if possible, indicate whether or not in your view, an alternative channel for our trade is readily available. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE MOUNSEY. His Majesty’s Consular Officers (Category 1 ). 10610 20070 -6a(b) Neutral firms— ( 1 ) In which there is an important enemy interest. (2) Engaged largely in trade with the enemy (particularly if largely engaged in fulfilling orders for an enemy Government). (3) Persons of enemy nationality or known sympathy or associa tion, especially if actively engaged in the distribution of propagandist literature for the purpose of damaging the allied cause. (4) Assisting the enemy in any way beyond what is legitimately incidental to their commercial dealings, e.g., exporting to an enemy country goods which have been allowed to pass the blockade under declaration or guarantee that they would not be so re-exported; exporting goods from a neutral to an enemy country in contravention of an export prohibition enacted by that neutral country; evading the Ijlockade by means of fraudulent commercial papers; obtaining enemy goods by evasion of the blockade; receiving and transmitting enemy commercial corres pondence. (5) Neutral concerns acting mainly as agents for enemy firms or for an enemy Government. Evidence that some (not necessarily the major) part of the business of a neutral agent is done on behalf of enemy firms or an enemy Government is not by itself enough to qualify that agent for inclusion in the Black List or the Statutory List. 4. As regards ( 1 ), ( 2 ) and (3), the mere fact that a firm has a German partner or partners, not exercising control, does not justify inclusion of the firm in the Statutory (or Black) Lists, unless some useful purpose will be served thereby. 5. No firm should be included in the Statutory List or the Black List unless there is reason to believe that its inclusion will damage us (and our Allies) less than it will damage the enemy. The Committee will require the fullest available evidence on this point before including a firm in either List. 6 . When the only objection against a company is that one or more of the Directors is connected with Black or Statutory listed firms, the Committee will require information about the control exercised by such Directors upon the management of the company before deciding whether or not to include that company in the Statutory or Black List. 7. The fact that a firm was included in the Statutory or Black Lis* in the last War is not by itself sufficient evidence to justify its inclusion in the present Statutory or Black Lists.[ I 2000 ] SECRET. Enclosure. Memorandum. 1 . THE general principle which will guide the Comihittee in deciding whether or not \o put a firm on the Statutory List (or^he Black List) is contained in the following minute of the Minister pi Blockade, dated March 1917, which says :— “ Generally speaking, a firm should only be/put on the Black List in the border neutrals because it is believed tKat, to allow goods to be consigned to the firm, will probably result in iheir reaching Germany, and a firm should he taken off the Black Likt, generally speaking, as soon as the danger no longer exists. It must always be remembered that there is nothing morally wrong or contrary to international law in a neutral trading with our enemies. From a neutral point of view, it is a perfectly legitimate proceeding just as tfie supply of munitions to us is perfectlv legitimate. Black-listing should, in fact, be considered as a purely business proposition. Will it/in fact, prevent supplies from reaching our enemies? If it will /hot, it is useless and probably pernicious If it will, it is right to bse it, whatever the circumstances of the individual case may be.” / 2. Anything which qualifies a firhi for inclusion in the Statutory List also qualifies it for inclusion in the Black List, and per contra, there are no offences justifying the inclusion of a Arm in the Black List which would not, other things being equal, justify its/inclusion in the Statutory List, 3. Subject to the considerations set out in paragraphs 4-8 below, any of the following qualify prima facie for inclusion in the Statutory (or Black) Lists (a) Enemy firms— An “ enemy ” for the purposes of the Trading with the Enemy Act means— (i) Any State, or Sovereign of a State, at war with His Majesty; (ii) Any individual resident in enemy territory; (iii) Any body of persons (whether corporate or unincorporate) carrying on business in any place, if and so long as the body is controlled by a person who under this Act is an enemy; (iv) Any body of persons constituted or incorporated in, or under the laws of a State at war with His Majesty; or (v) Persons and firms named in Specified Persons Orders under the Act, i.e., firms controlled by a person or persons resident in enemy territory, or by a person included in the Statutory List. io 6 ica 2C070—6a5 &gt; A 4 r&gt; 3 8 . The fact that a consignee has goods in the Prize Court awaiting judgment is not by itself enough to justify the inclusion of his name in either List. 9 . If the only objection against a company is that a part, but not the main part, of its activities consists in the re-export of goods of enemy origin, the Committee will not normally include it in either List. 10. On the question which of the two Lists a firm with sufficient enemy taint should be put on, the Commiteee will be guided by the following general principles — ( 1 ) The Statutory List should include firms of unchallengeable enemy character; the Black List should include firms where the evidence is not quite so strong. (2) The Statutory List should not be too long, otherwise it might lead to the mass production of cc cloaks ” or “ men of straw.” (3) The Statutory List should consist almost entirely of important firms, leaving less important firms for inclusion in the Black List. (4) Firms which would normally have appeared in the Statutory List should appear only in the Black List if it is considered necessary to avoid offending the Government of the country in which the firms are carrying on business. (The Statutory List is public and the Black List is confidential.) (5) The Black List is primarily for the purpose of preventing goods getting into the hands of people who will send them to our enemies; the Statutory List is primarily for the purpose of hampering trade carried on in German interests. ( 6 ) The Black List will be the principal list of undesirable traders in neutral countries contiguous to the enemy; the Statutory List will be the principal list of undesirable traders in countries not bordering on the enemy.il STATU TORY [to f 5 . ;v a|jd OSS’- ‘f l': ' /- TRADING”WITHTHE ENfijVI¥^&gt;___ PtKS^^^ ixJxJo Specified Persons ■ --C ' The Trading with the Enemy (Specified Persons) (Amend ment) (No. 3 ) Order, 1939 , dated November 23 , 1939 , MADE BY THE BOARD OF TRADE.

Black List Committee, Ministry of Economic Warfare, 6 February 1940.STATUTORY, BLACK AND SUSPECT LIST POLICY. 1.—THE OBJECTS OF THE POLICY. In its broadest aspects, Statutory and Black List policy is directed at interference with the external trade of the enemy and the prevention of supplies from reaching the enemy. This is secured— (а) by prohibiting or obstructing intercourse between the persons named and persons subject to the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act and of corresponding enactments overseas; (б) by obstructing intercourse between the persons named and neutrals; and (c) by interfering, through contraband control, exports control, &amp;c., with trade between the persons named and the enemy. The effect of (a) is to prevent firms* to whom the Trading with the Enemy Act applies from “having any commercial, financial or other intercourse or dealings with, or for the benefit of,” any person or firm named in the Statutory List unless in exceptional circum stances such intercourse or dealings have been officially authorised. British firms or individuals resident in neutral countries and not controlled from British territory are not covered by the provisions of the Act, but, whether or not they are affected by any common law obligation, they may be expected on patriotic grounds to refrain from trading with enemy concerns unless the only likely result of the British firm’s refusal to trade would be to direct profitable business to a non-British competitor without embarrassing the commercial activities of the enemy, f The effect of (b) is, by reason of the fear which traders have of the consequences for their business, to tend to prevent persons or firms doing business with the enemy, including, of course, specified persons or firms. Fear of inclusion is, on occasions, fully as effective in preventing goods reaching enemy territory as would be actual inclusion. Banks are, moreover, enabled by the existence of these lists to refuse credit to neutral firms to be utilized for the benefit of a person or firm on the Statutory or Black Lists. To carry (c) into effect it is necessary to provide the Contraband Committee and Contraband Control Bases with a rapid means of identifying suspect shipments and our Customs and Import and Export Licensing Departments as well as Censorship with a convenient list of names upon which the necessary action can be taken. 2.—THE WEAPONS. The two principal weapons of the Black List Committee’s policy are the Statutory List and the Black List. The Statutory List is a list of persons or firms, published under * The expression “ firm ” is used in this memorandum as including any trading body whether corporate or unincorporate or a business carried on by an individual trading under his own or another name. f A principal or parent company operating in British territory may, of course, commit an offence against the Act through or owing to the actions of its agent or subsidiary abroad and this in effect obliges the latter to conform to the Act.[20760—5] c * 1 he provisions of sub-section '2 of section 2 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, intercourse with whom is a criminal offence. The Black List is a confidential list of persons or firms, intercourse with whom is prevented, whenever possible, by administrative action, and discouraged by advice to banks and traders that virtually amounts to prohibition. .Both lists provide the Contraband Control authorities with a ready means of identifying shipments which are to be regarded as highly suspect. The Statutory List is perhaps the more effective instrument for achieving objects (a) an( * (')» j )U t th e Black List is probably more effective for securing object (c), since being confidential, the Black List is less likely to lead to the creation of “ cloaks ” or * * men-of- straw, w ho may be difficult to trace. For these reasons, the Statutory List is the principal list of undesirable traders in countries not bordering on the enemy, 'while the Black List (of which the main purpose is the more limited one of preventing goods reaching people who will pass them on to the enemy or who will handle enemy exports) should be the principal list of undesirable traders in European countries. To some extent, however, the Statutory List will be used in European countries (in particular for well-known enemy- controlled firms, so as to warn British traders with whom they must not trade, see paragraph o (&lt;z) below), while the Black List wdll also be used in overseas countries (e.g., against consignors known to have evaded our contraband control). The Black List may also be preferable to the Statutory List for reasons connected with the War Trade Agreements which are in course of being made with certain European countries. A subsidiary but nevertheless important weapon is the Suspect List (which will differ essentially from the Preliminary Suspect List so far issued). The Suspect List proper, while of itself carrying no disabilities, will serve— (a) to warn the Censors and War Trade Keporting Officers that a particularly close investigation is required of the names on that list; and (b) to warn the Contraband and Enemy Export Committees and Export Licensing Department that there is a case for some suspicion against consignments under such names, though not of itself justifying detention or other penalty. a.—THE BLACK LIST COMMITTEE’S WORK. The Black List Committee’s work has up to now been mainly devoted to compiling the Statutory List, which now comprises firms carrying on business in most foreign countries, this w-ork will be continued. The Black List, at present, contains only about 100 names. The Black List Committee is now giving urgent attention to the compilation ot a compre hensive Black List. At the same time the Black List Section of the Ministry is carrying out a complete reorganisation of the Suspect List. 4.—COMPILATION OF THE BLACK LIST. His Majesty’s Missions are now asked to submit names of the most important consignors and consignees in each neutral country (as w r ell as important firms engaged in shipping or insurance business) who are known to have been engaged extensively in trade with the enemy since the outbreak of war, specifying as far as possible the nature of the trade and the types of commodity concerned in each case. Missions are asked to concentrate in the first instance upon furnishing the names of the most important suppliers and forwarding agents of commodities in which the enemy is deficient. A list of such commodities is given in Annex I. Suggestions for the guidance of War Trade Reporting Officers in preparing reports for submission to the Ministry are contained in Annex II.5.—THE NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE REQUIRED. (a) Enemyfcontrolled firms. Firms in neutral countries, if under enemy control, are under sub-section 1 (c) of section 2 of the Trading with the Enemy Act defined as “enemy ’’* and persons and firms subject to the provisions of that Act are liable to the penalties prescribed therein if they engage in intercourse with such firms. For the assistance of British traders, however, and as a deterrent to other neutrals, the more important of such firms are in addition ‘ specified ’’ as enemy by the inclusion of their names in the Statutory List. Enemy control is always a question of fact. For instance, enemy ownership of a majority of shares in a company may, generally but not necessarily, be regarded as con stituting enemy control, but ownership of a relatively small proportion, if accompanied by active directors or managers of enemy nationality and sympathies, may also suggest grounds for including a firm in the Statutory List. In the same way the active direction of a partnership by partners of enemy nationality, although the majority of the capital is not provided by enemies, may justify inclusion in the Statutory List. (b) Neutral firms. Such firms having close enemyf associations or sympathies qualify for the Statutorv and Black Lists where— (i) there is an important enemy shareholding which does not amount to control; (ii) the firm is engaged largely either as regards volume or proportion, in trade with the enemy; (m) the firm is assisting the enemy in a way beyond what is legitimate!v incidental to its commercial dealings, for instance— '.(a) exporting to the enemy goods which have been allowed to pass the Contraband Control authorities under declaration or guarantee that they would not be so re-exported; (b) exporting goods of enemy origin or interest under wrongful certificate of origin knowing them to be such; (c) exporting merchandise from a neutral country to the enemy in contravention -j\ • a - n ex P or ^ prohibition by that neutral country; (d) importing goods of enemy origin or interest in contravention of an import prohibition by a neutral country; * Section 2 of the Act reads as follows: — 2 .-(i) Subject to the provisions of this section, the expression “ enemv purposes of this Act means— 1 tuemy for the (a) any State, or Sovereign of a State, at war with His Maiestv • (b) any individual resident in enemy territory - (c) any body of persons (whether corporate or nnincorporate) carrying on business in Sot“'ai“try‘™r g aS thB b&lt; * iS • Pe-n g wL, b nnTr S9 th” W “''awS ” inC ° ri “ » ^er the laws of, a State but does not include any person by reason only that he is an enemv subieot. for the purposeTof this Act! m ^ ^ ^ t It should be borne in mind that “ enemy ” is not synonymous with “ enemy subject.'[20760—5] c* 2 (e) evading the contraband control by means of fraudulent commercial papers; (/) obtaining goods of enemy origin or interest by evasion of the contraband control; (g) receiving and transmitting enemy commercial correspondence; or (h) being engaged in the dissemination of enemy propaganda; (iv) the firm is acting mainly as agents for enemy concerns, including persons or firms on the Statutory List, or for an enemy Government. (Evidence that some, not necessarily the major part, of the business of a neutral agent is done on behalf of enemy firms or an enemy Government, may not be by itself enough to qualify that agent for inclusion in the Statutory 'List or Black List.) The Committee, however, wishes to emphasize the following points: — (a) No firm should be included in the Statutory or the Black List unless there is reason to believe that its inclusion will damage the enemy more than it will damage us (and our Allies). The Committee will require the fullest evidence on this point before including a firm in either list. (b) The mere fact that a firm has a partner or partners of enemy nationality or origin, does not, in itself, justify the inclusion of the firm in the Statutory (or Black) List. (c) When the only objection against a firm is that one or more of its directors is connected with Statutory or Black listed firms, the Committee will require information about the extent of control exercised by such directors upon its management before deciding whether or not to include that firm in the Statutory or Black Lists. (d) The fact that a firm was included in the Statutory or Black List during the war of 1914-18 is not by itself sufficient evidence to justify its inclusion in the present Statutory or Black Lists. J' ' . '. 6.—THE EFFECTS OF THE STATUTORY, BLACK AND SUSPECT LISTS. Since inclusion in the War Trade Lists has consequences which are serious to all concerned the Committee particularly wishes to emphasize certain aspects of this question : — (a) Statutory List. (i) Effects on neutral firms. Individuals or firm splaced on the Statutory List— V- (a) will receive no goods from any Allied firm except where special dispensation is granted; (b) if they be consignors, they will be liable to have their cargoes detained by the Contraband Control and even seized and put into the Prize Court; (c) if they be consignees, they will be liable to have the cargoes shipped to them seized and put into the Prize Court; and (d) they will receive no advantage from credits granted by British banks either directly or through the intermediary of a neutral bank. (ii) Effects on the British exporter. Save by special dispensation which will rarely be given, no commercial, financial or other business relationship may be entered into by British firms with those persons or firms on this List.(b) Black List. (i) Effects on neutral firms. Persons or firms on the Black List will, to all intents and purposes, be treated as though they were on the Statutory List; the only effective difference will be that they will not know— (a) that they have publicly been recognised as enemies; (b) exactly what action can be taken against them and exactly what steps they can take to defend themselves from the effects of such action. Cargoes consigned to firms on the Black List and held for examination, may and often will be seized and put into the Prize Court. It is therefore essential that the reasons which originally prompted the Committee to include these firms in the Black List should be good, since they may have to stand review in the Prize Court. (ii) Effects on the British exporter. Whilst it is not a criminal offence for British traders to attempt to trade with firms upon this list, unless they are enemies within the meaning of the Act, although not so specified, they will, in fact, be discouraged from doing so, if alternative channels of trade are believed to be open. Banks can refuse credit to merchants or firms attempting to trade with black-listed firms, in so far as occasion may have arisen to warn them against dealings involving such firms. (c) Suspect List. (i) Effects on neutral firms. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that no penalty attaches to a person or firms on the Suspect List merely by reason of that fact. For instance, person or firms placed on the Suspect List will in all probability not have their cargoes seized, certainly not by reason only of their inclusion in this list. The sole purpose of the list is to enable those on it to be subject to special observation with a view to obtaining concrete evidence of their guilt or innocence. (ii) Effects on the British exporter. W hilst applications for import and export licences will not for this reason be refused, they will be most carefully scrutinised, as will also goods not subject to licence wdien passing through the Customs. F B It will be appreciated, therefore, that great care must be exercised bv His Majesty’s Missions when submitting names for inclusion in the Statutory and Black Lists, for (apart from the lisk that disproportionate damage may be done to British as compared with enemy trade), if a neutral firm or individual experiences unjustifiable loss of trade or inconvenience, His Majesty s^Government may be involved in acrimonious discussion with neutral govern ments. The Committee wishes to emphasise, however, that no British firms or individuals abroad wall be required to cease intercourse with the enemy if by so doina they would expose themselves to legal proceedings to which they would have' no good defence, but in that case an application should be made to the Trading with the Enemy Branch for a licence. In this connection it is worth remarking upon the difference that exists between the Statutory List and the Black List. If a firm or individual is wrongly included in the Statutory List, loss and inconvenience are caused to the firm or individuals so designated • but as the Statutory List is published, the firm or individual can appeal, and if wromdv included, can have the disability removed. * 1 ’ g &gt; On the other hand, if an individual or firm is w r rongly included in the Black List which is not published and should remain confidential, the chances of appeal are thereby reduced and those of permanent damage to our owm trade correspondingly increased.7.—THE SUSPECT LIST. I he Suspect List as printed in War Trade Lists No. 1 ’’ is to be withdr awn as soon as possible, since it has been found that it is too large and too misleading to serve as a guide to the ( ensois, either for the control of messages or for the collection of information, and is too \ague to be of any real value to the Contraband Control, Customs or Import and Export Licensing Departments It is to be replaced by a restricted list of names sufficiently suspicious to be potential candidates for inclusion in the Statutory or Black Lists. This will enable the Censors, if the list is not too large, to watch all information concerning such firms, while, as has been mentioned in paragraph 2, inclusion in the List will be sufficient warning to the Contraband and Enemy Exports Committees and other departments of the possibility at least of enemy destination, origin or interest. It may sometimes happen that a neutral firm which has been ostensibly whitewashed (c.&lt;7., removed from the Statutory or Black List) is yet placed upon the suspect list as a measure of precaution. To assist in the compilation of the new Suspect List, His Majesty’s Missions are asked to review the wdiole of their recommendations for the War Trade Lists (except, of course, those already approved by the Committee for inclusion in the Statutory or Black Lists) with the object of selecting the firms who are suspected of being able to qualify, if further evidence is forthcoming, under one of the headings mentioned in paragraph 5 (6). Information about such firms should be drawn up on the lines indicated in Annex II. The effects of being placed on the Suspect List have already been discussed in paragraph 6 (c). 8.—ASSURANCES, GUARANTEES, FINANCIAL BONDS, STATUTORY DECLARATIONS AND CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN. (1) Assurances and Guarantees. In order to avoid being placed on, or to obtain their removal from, the Statutory List, neutral firms are sometimes prepared to give assurances that they are not controlled by the enemy and/or will limit their trade with the enemy. These cases may be broadly divided into three classes: — (a) Firms whose trade with the enemy prior to the outbreak of war was only a small proportion of their total trade. Such firms, in return for a recommendation that they will not be placed on the Statutory List or will be removed therefrom if already specified, may be induced to sign a warranty that they are not controlled by the enemy, and an undertaking that for the period of the war they will have no dealings whatsoever with the enemy. In such cases, His Majesty’s Missions are authorised, with the approval of Ministry of Economic Warfare, to inform the firm that they will recommend their removal from the Statutory List on the production of a written undertaking in the form of Annex III. An undertaking of this nature should be attested before the local British Consul. (b) Firms whose trade with the enemy prior to the outbreak of war ivas considerable. Such firms in return for a similar recommendation may be induced to sign a warranty that they are not controlled by the enemy and a declaration stating that for the period of the war they will not enter into any 4 ea li n g s with the enemy without the approval in writing from His Majesty’s Representative which will only be granted in very exceptional circumstances and in no case without prior reference to the Ministry. In such cases His Majesty’s Missions are authorised, with the approval of Ministry of Economic Warfare, to inform the firm that they will recommend that it will not be placed on the Statutoryi 4 8 List, or will recommend that it will be removed therefrom if already specified, on the production of a document in the form of Annex IV. Such an undertaking should be verified by a local British chartered accountant and attested before the local British Consul. (c) Where a firm is enemy controlled. It may be desirable in exceptional cases in order to further the interests of British trade, to induce such a firm to enter into a guarantee by which, in return for some limitation of their trade with the enemy, His Majesty’s Kepresentative would undertake to recommend His Majesty’s Government not to specify it as an enemy, and to obtain the necessary dispensation under the Trading with the Enemy Act. In such cases, His Majesty’s Missions are required to report immediat-ely giving a list of the British firms with whom the neutral firm desires to trade. The Committee wishes to emphasise the following points: — (i) It does not desire to compel neutral firms to relinquish trade with an enemy when by so doing they would be liable to come into conflict with local law. (ii) The action proposed in regard to neutral firms who desire to avoid being placed on the Statutory List, or desire removal therefrom, should be reported immediately by telegraph to the Ministry, stating the name and address of the firm and the nature of its trade. It should, however, be borne in mind that any initiative by His Majesty’s Representative in regard to prospective candidates for the Statutory List should only be taken in exceptional cases, e.g., where it is proposed to specify a firm which holds an important agency for a United Kingdom firm, and it is difficult to secure any other equally suitable agent. There is the danger that such an approach may achieve no other purpose than putting an undesirable firm on its guard, or delaying its inclusion in the Statutory List. (2) Financial Bonds. In other cases where there has been reason to believe that notwithstanding such guarantees as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the firm may continue to have dealings with the enemy through an intermediary or “ cloak,” it may be necessary to induce the firm to enter into a financial bond as a pre-requisite of removal from the Statutory List. In all such cases His Majesty’s Missions should obtain the necessary authority before entering into further negotiations with the firm. In reporting, Missions should indicate the extent and value of the firm s trade with the enemy, since this information is necessary to determine the amount of the bond which will be required. The bond should clearlv not be of such a size as to cripple the firm concerned. A guarantee such as that mentioned in (b) above, coupled with a moderate bond, may well have the desired effect, because if such a guarantee is broken, the firm will not only lose a sum of money so calculated to be equal at least to the profits gained from its illicit trade with the enemy, but at the same time will experience the disability of being placed on the Statutory List. f bon j deposited in a London bank will normally be required as a condition of removina any firms from the Statutory List, except those included in error. p3) Statutory Declarations and Certificates of Origin. A large number of declarations or guarantees have been given by importers in neutral countries, to the effect that the goods to which they refer will not be re-exported to Germanv Similarly, declarations regarding non-enemy origin or absence of enemy interest are beine given by neutral exporting firms Failure to fulfil such obligations qualifies the neutral firms concerned for inclusion in the Statutory or Black List. Any information therefore m9 which suggests that neutral firms are not carrying out their obligations in this respect should be reported immediately to the Ministry. The Black List Committee will not take action against a film for such an offence unless the information comes from a reliable source, and is well documented. In all cases when a report is made to the effect that a firm has given a satisfactory guarantee or been given a certificate of origin, it will be understood that the document has been given in the latest form issued from time to time by the Ministry. If there is any variation in the document this fact should be mentioned in the report. It is suggested that Mis Majesty s Kepresentatives should keep records of the documents declared before them in order to facilitate prompt reference to Ministry of Economic Warfare of any failure to carry out an obligation or a wrongful declaration as to the origin of the goods. 9—ALTERNATIVE CHANNELS OF TRADE FOR BRITISH AND ALLIED EXPORTERS. The Black List Committee will not normally recommend the inclusion of any firm in either the Statutory List or the Black List unless it know r s whether or not the firm in question handles an appreciable amount of British or Allied trade, and the names of the British or Allied traders concerned; and whether, as in the case of a public utility Company, its functions are so closely connected with British firms or interests that to prohibit or impede intercourse between it and British or Allied subjects might react to our disadvantage. If a firm recommended for inclusion in the Statutory List is, for example, a forwarding agent, it may be possible for British or Allied trade in the country concerned to continue through another agent. The Committee therefore wishes to emphasize that when making a recommendation, the adoption of which would close a channel of trade hitherto used by British or Allied traders, His Majesty’s Missions should, whenever possible indicate whether or not in their view’, an alternative channel for our trade is readily available. In making recommendations in regard to alternative channels, Missions should supply the fullest possible information as to the commercial and financial standing of the firms suggested. It may be, however, that a firm recommended for inclusion in the Statutory List is in a position to purchase in whatever market it pleases, and that if it is prevented from obtaining goods from Allied sources it will have no difficulty in satisfying its require ments from some other country. To specify such a firm as an enemy may therefore lose us business and deprive us of foreign exchange without inflicting corresponding damage on the enemy. These considerations apply wdth particular force to firms outside Europe. His Majesty’s Missions should exercise the greatest care to satisfy themselves that the adoption of their recommendations w r ill inflict no unnecessary injury on ourselves; and when making recommendations for the inclusion of particular firms in the Statutory List, they should report the circumstances if a situation such as that described above appears likely to arise. The weapon of our War Trade Lists is one w’hich can turn in our hands and cause us serious harm unless it is wielded wdth discretion, care and understanding by all concerned. Provided, however, it is used with discretion and promptitude, it will be seen from the foregoing that it is capable of inflicting considerable harm on the enemy’s war-time trade.

The Committee does not expect that it will be possible to provide all this information in the case of every individual firm, nor does it desire that reports should be delayed until complete information is obtained. d his applies particularly to reports on firms merely under suspicion, about whom some information may already be available to the Ministry.

(g) The names and addresses of any British firms with whom the firm has business relations. (ii) Control. (a) If the firm is a partnership, who owns the controlling interest ; if a public or private company, who are the principal shareholders or debenture holders (if anv) and how many shares or debentures they hold. (b) When a company is controlled by another company it is important to have the same information about the controlling company and its directors and majority shareholders. (c) When a company is known to be in the hands of a bank or to be influenced in its policy by a bank, this information should be furnished. (d) Where a firm has outstanding liabilities to any other firm by way of quasi-permanent loan capital, similar information should be furnished regarding the creditor firm. (iii) Extent of Enemy Association. (a) This means the extent to which a company trades with enemy territory or the extent to which firms in enemy territory, or enemy firms in a neutral country, exercise directive influence or control over a firm which may be nominally a neutral company or partnership. (b) When a firm is known to be financially attached to or influenced in its trading policy by a firm on the Statutory or Black Lists, it may itself through this connection become a candidate for the Statutory or Black Lists. This information should therefore be furnished. (B)— The Nature and Importance of a Firm’s Normal Business. (1) Size. Whenever possible, information in regard to the capital employed by a company in the conduct of its business should be stated. The backing it can obtain from a bank should also be described. A firm can be of importance in an industry or trade and yet work almost exclusively through facilities provided by a bank or other source. Details of its capital alone may therefore be misleading. When details in regard to capital or banking facilities cannot be obtained, turnover figures may disclose its size. Furthermore, if its turnover differs greatly from normal, this may well give indications of an activity worth closer examination. (2) Business. (a) For the purpose of the Statutory and Black Lists it is essential to know -not only what business a firm is doing with the enemy, but also the amount and nature of the business it does with the United Kingdom, the Empire, France and other countries. Where a firm is mainly a trading concern purchasing an important part of its products from abroad or is a manufacturing concern dependent, or largely dependent, upon the United Kingdom, the Empire or France for certain vital materials, considerable injury may be done by Statutory or Black List action. Consequently, it is important that recommendations for the inclusion of firms in these Lists should be accompanied by information showing the manner in which the firm would be damaged by such action. (b) A comparison between a firm’s pre-war and current business with the enemy, both as regards volume and as regards the commodities or goods handled, may provide informa tion on which action can be taken. Information on changes in kind and in volume should therefore be reported. (3) Standing. The standing of a firm in the community in which it trades is also of importance and should be reported.ANNEX III. Draft Warranty and Undertaking. We, Messrs.

Deputy Secretary to th4 Government of India&lt; *V ^5 Extract from India Office Express Letter No. E.&amp; 0.17878/40, dated the 21st June 1940. The channels via neutral countries in Europe through which Germany might b« able to obtain supplies of contraband goods are now greatly reduced in number and as you are aware efforts are being made through negotiations l^tth Japan to deal with the possibility of supply by the A ^rans-Siberian route. It is possible that a tendency will , develop for certain classes of goods to be sent to Germany via Iran and either by rail through Russia or via the Black Sea and the Danube. These are goods which/of special value to the enemy on account of their acute shortage but are relatively small in volume. No evidence * has yet come to notice here that any such trade via Iran is being developed, but it seems desirable that the position should be watched. 2. It is in particular desirable to watch trade in / certain metals used for hardening steel such as nickel, wolfram, molybdenum, cobalt, chromite and other similar commodities of vtfhich Germany is known to be in very short supply. Such stocks of these as may be held in India are presumably not available for export, and any supplies | which the enemy might try to obtain through the Middle East would be lanaed in India only for the pilrpose of transhipment or night be carried in. ships calling at Indian ports. To meet the case of these commodities it would appear that the only step which can usefully be ' taken by the Government of India is that the port authori ties and the consular authorities in the Persian Gulf should be apprised of the possibility of attempts being made by the enemy to develop this channel of supply. If you see no objection I should be glad if this step nay be aken. The port and consular authorities shouldjWatch for developments and should report any unusual and suspicious traffic which may come to their notice.No.C/634-28/4.

YOUR REFERENCE C/701-28/4—I TA LIAN GOODS The hats ordered by us in August 1939 from Naples, Italy, have since arrived in Bombay by post parcel but are held up by the authorities pending sanction from the Customs Department in Bahrain. We have as yet not paid for the felt hats nor had we sent any advance to the shippers at the time the order was placed. Hoping we will get your sanction to import these hats into Bahrain and thanking you, Yours faithfully,Confidential 4 No.C/717-28/4• Political Agency, Bahrain, the 14th September 1940* r From To The Political Agent, Bahrain The Custodian of Enemy Property Bombay. Subject t- Italian Goods consigned to Bahrain held by Bombay Customs. Sir, I have the honour to say that in August 1939 a firm in Bahrain - Ashraf Brothers - ordered a consignment of hats from Messrs. Borsalino Giuseppe Fratello, of Naples, Italy. They were shipped to the a ddress of the Eastern Bank Limited, Bahrain, on the 5th April 1940 and it is now learnt that they have been detained in the Customs warehouses at Bombay. Ashraf Brothers state that they have made no payment for the hats and made no advance at the time of placing the order and they request that the consignment be released for shipment to Bahrain. I should be grateful if you would let me know if the goods can be released and if so on what conditions • I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, for Political Agent, Bahrain.Dear Sir, We have recently shipped to India thirty-four bags of empty crown cork type sodawater bottles. Of these thirty-four, thirty bags were sent to us about three months ago from Karachi by mistake as we had ordered Codds type and not crown cork. As these bottles do not have a sale in Bahrain, we arranged to reship them to Karachi along with six gross others that we had lying with us for the past two years. These six gross were packed in four bags and in the original packing. We enclose herein the invoice covering these four gross, dated 1st September 1938 ajid we certify that these f were the same bottles shipped by us recently. / AJ2 f YY) These bottles were of German manufacture and as such have been held up by the Customs in Karachi pending a certificate from the Political Agent of Bahrain. We therefore request you to grant us such a certificate, if found in order, for the four bags (six gross) empty crown cork bottles. For your guidance, we enclose herein the shipping bill and shall be grateful if it is returned to us along with the attached invoice, when done with. Yours faithfully, Thanking you,STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS 1940 No. 1289 © EMERGENCY POWERS (DEFENCE) , Trading with the Enemy 'Order in Council amending Regulation 3 of, and adding Regulation 3A to, the Defence (Trading with the Enemy) Regulations, 1940.

Sir, IN view of enquiries, which have been received by this Ministry from certain of His Majesty’s Missions abroad concerning the effect of the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act on the activities of British insurance companies, I am directed by the Minister for Economic Warfare to transmit to you herewith a copy of a memorandum on the subject, which has been prepared by the Trading with the Enemy Branch of the Treasury and Board of Trade. ^ 2. With regard to paragraph 2 {a) (i) the Trading with the Enemy Joint Insurance Committee, a body representative of all British insurance interests other than Life offices, have emphasised to their constituents that the concession is an enabling one of which it is not intended that unrestricted use should be made, and that insurers should endeavour to avoid any action, which would be inconsistent with the general policy of His Majesty’s Government in relation to the hampering of enemy trade. The Committee have also recommended their constituents not to give their representatives in the territories concerned (apart from the United States) a free hand with regard to the acceptance of the insurances of enemies in these territories, but to make it clear that there is to be no indiscriminate acceptance of enemy business and, in particular, that insurance of enemies should not be entertained, if it is known or thought to be the case that adequate insurance facilities are not readily available from other sources. The Committee have also pointed out that, while it may be necessary for British insurance firms to communicate with their representatives in regard to the various decisions set out in the circulars, which the Committee have His Majesty’s Consular Officers. p.t.o. 10893 a [ 29760 — 9 a]9 sent to their constituents and of which the enclosed Memorandum is a summary, it is not intended that the circulars themselves or the decisions as a whole should be sent to representatives. 3. While it is hoped that the enclosed Memorandum will enable you to appreciate the principles which have hitherto guided the Trading with the Enemy Branch in their administration of the Trading with the Enemy Act as it affects insurance, it is requested that, if any enquiries are addressed to you, you should decline to give any decision, but should refer the enquirer to his principal in the United Kingdom, who will consult the Trading with the Enemy Joint Insurance Committee. Should you yourself at any time be in doubt over any particular point, it is requested that you should refer to the Financial Pressure Department of this Ministry. 4 . Additional copies of this circular despatch are forwarded herewith for transmission to Consular Officers under your superintendence. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, GEORGE MOUNSEY. ■T/E. Gen. 210. 7 ^ TRADING WITH THE ENEMY ACT, 1939. Insurance. AUTHORITY GOVERNING THE CONDUCT OF INSURANCE BUSINESS GIVEN TO THE TRADING WITH THE ENEMY JOINT INSURANCE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING ALL UNITED KINGDOM INSURANCE INTERESTS, OTHER THAN LIFE OFFICES. 1 . NEITHER the Trading with the Enemy Branch nor the Custodian of Enemy Property regard any of the following three statements of law r as not being accurate: — (a) It is not a contravention of the Trading with the Enemy Act to enter into any contract of insurance or reinsurance with anybody (other than an enemy) covering any interest, other than the interest of an enemy, in any property merely because the whole or any part of the property, the subject-matter of the contract, is situated in enemy territory: or to discharge any obligations under that contract. Payment in respect of any such contract must not be made in enemy territory. (b) Obligations to anyone who is not an enemy under any contract of insurance justiciable in an Allied or neutral State and enforceable under the laws of that State may be discharged notwithstanding that incidentally or indirectly an enemy may be benefited by the discharge of such obligations. (c) The fact that the representative in a neutral State of a British insurer represents also an enemy insurance company, or is an enemy subject (but not an enemy), does not of itself involve trading with the enemy. 2 (a) (i).—Insurance risks may be undertaken for and discharged to any concern carrying on business in a neutral State outside Europe (Europe includes Iceland) even though such concern is enemy controlled or a Specified Person, provided the risk is locally situated in such neutral State, e.g., fire and general property risks. 2 (a) (ii).—As regards risks locally situated in neutral States in Europe (including Iceland), insurance transactions with any concern carrying on business in such neutral State and being enemy controlled or a Specified Person require a Special Licence. Application is to be made through the Trading with the Enemy Joint Insurance Committee representing all insurance interests in the United Kingdom except Life Insurance. This applies to British insurers contracting direct or through agents in such neutral States, and separate legal entities in neutral countries accustomed to work under directions from British insurers are considered agents. Note. —The acts of a British Company’s subsidiary which in practice acts under its control are for Trading with the Enemy purposes treated as the acts of the parent concern. Therefore a subsidiary cannot insure an enemy or an enemy risk in Europe without special licence. 2 (fc).—Insurance is permitted with any non-enemy covering any interest in property in enemy territory belonging to a concern wheresoever incorporated (including enemy territory) if controlled by the insured, but payment must not be made in enemy territory, e.g., the X.Y.Z. Motor * Company Inc. (U.S.A.) control the X.Y.Z. Motor Company, Hamburg, incorporated in Germany. Insurance of the property of the latter for the benefit of X.Y.Z. Motor Company, U.S.A., is allowed. 10897 a 20760—82 (c).—Liability under a pre-war insurance in favour of an enemy if enforceable in British Empire or any Allied or neutral State may be discharged provided the insurer is fatisfied by competent legal advice that the Trading with the Enemy Act would not afford a good defence in the Courts in which the insurer may be sued. The proviso does not apply in those countries and in the case of those risks which may be freely insured under 2 (a) (i) above. 2 (d) (i)—Treaty Reinsurance business is allowed to continue with companies incorporated in Allied or neutral States so long as they are not enemies or declared by the Joint Committee to be undesirable, provided that a British insurer ceding business shall forthwith secure from the (in most cases) neutral insurance company an undertaking that no such business will be retroceded to an enemy insurance company or to another neutral unless such neutral gives to the reassured a similar undertaking that none of t le business will be retroceded to an enemy. 2 (d) (ii).—Facultative Reinsurance (i.e., reinsurance offered under existing options or ad hoc to other reinsurance companies) business is also allowed to continue with non-enem&gt; companies, but only in respect of risks for which a British insurer is allowed to insure direct, provided that a British insurer ceding such business shall (except in L.b.A.) obtain an undertaking special to the case concerned or of a general inclusive nature similar to the undertakings under 2 (d) (i) above. \ 0TES —The permission under 2 (d) (i) and 2 (d) (ii) includes entering into new business and renewing or other continuation of old business. The undertaking referred to should be obtained in all reinsurance business ceded to a neutral, whether i^ involves the Trading with the Enemy Act or not. 2 (d) (iii)—Liability under a pre-war facultative reinsurance contract with an enemy, if enforceable in a neutral State, may be discharged, provided the reinsurer is satisfied by competent legal advice that the Trading with the Enemy Act would not afford a good defence in the neutral Courts. The proviso does not apply in the case of contracts enforceable in the U.S.A. 2 (d) (iv).—Liability under facultative reinsurance for risks situate or arising in any neutral State in Europe (including Iceland) with (i.e., offered to the British company by and concluded with) an insurance or reinsurance company incorporated in an Allied or neutral State and not being an enemy or declared by the Joint Committee to be undesirable may be discharged, although the insured is found after the reinsurance has been effected to be an enemv. Provided that a British insurer who enters into or renews such facultative reinsurance after the 15 th January, 1940 , must obtain from the neutral ceding company an assurance to the effect that the company has no reason to believe that the insured is an enemy within Section 2 ( 1 ) of the Trading with the Enemy Act. 2 ( e ).—Insurance of any kind for diplomatic representatives de caniere of neutral States, even though residing in enemy territory, is allowed. 2 (f).—Insurance for enemies of property situate in or in respect of risks arising in the United Kingdom is allowed, provided no intercourse takes place with the enemy except bv licence; any pavment becoming due to the insured must be declared to the Custodian ot Enemy Property. This covers cases in which the enemy’s agent here, voluntarily or by leave of the Custodian, continues to pay premiums. 2 (g). Liability under Marine Insurance (except hull insurance) not subject to United Kingdom and Allies capture clause and enforceable in the British Empire or in an Allied or neutral State may be discharged, although it is found after making the contract that the rights thereunder are exerciseable by an enemy, but in such case no payment shall be made unless the insurer is satisfied by competent legal advice that the Trading with the Enemy Act would not afford a defence in the Courts in which he may be sued.3 The licence granted in this paragraph is given on the understanding that British insurers will take steps to secure wherever possible insertion of a Capture clause exempting them from liability in the event of detention or seizure by His Majesty or any of His Allies in all direct or reinsurance marine risks contracts (other than hull risks) except on voyages wholly outside the combat area or in countries the laws of which forbid such clauses. Notes. —Paragraphs 2 (a) (1) and 2 (/) above do not apply for marine insurance. The licences mentioned in this memorandum do not apply to life assurance. Nothing contained above authorises insurance against capture, seizure, arrest, restraint or detainment by any of His Majesty’s Governments or any of its Allies. These licences relate only to the position under the Trading with the Enemy Act of the United Kingdom and not to the position under similar legislation of other parts of the British Empire or Allied countries. It is not an offence under the Trading with the Enemy Act for a British insurer to have as representative in a neutral State a person not an enemy who also represents an enemy insurance company; but in every case where such representative (except in U.S.A.) is himself an enemy, a licence to continue such representation must be applied for through the Joint Committee. Before applying, the insurer should inform His Majesty’s Repre sentative in the locality of the agent fully of the reasons for desiring to continue such representation; any report which His Majesty’s Representative may make will, it is assumed, in due course be available to this Branch. Claims on personal accident and motor car insurance policies issued to non-enemy insured, but arising out of a short visit to enemy territory, may be met, provided that payment is made outside enemy territory. Normal risks may be written and renewed and claims discharged in favour of enemy internees in the United Kingdom. F. W. McCOMBE, Trading with the Enemy Branch (Treasury and Board of Trade).

Sir, I am directed by the Minister of Economic Warfare to enclose a copy of the notice appearing in the Board of Trade Journal of the 27th February dealing with the refusal of Navicerts, Certificates of Origin and Interest (or equivalent documents), &amp;c., to consignments insured by enemy companies. 2. On the 13th March it is proposed to give notice of the date when the refusals are to come into force, which date will be about thirty-five days from this second notice, i.e., about the 17th April. His Majesty's representatives abroad and traders will thus have had ample time in which to adjust themselves to the new regulations. The period has been made as long as this mainly to give traders time to cancel any running insurance contracts which they may have with enemy companies. 3. The list of enemy companies will be sent to you shortly. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. W. LEITH-ROSS.

Commissioners of Customs and Excise give notice that the following documents, viz.:—• Navicerts; ( ertificates of Origin and Interest (or equivalent documents); and Export Licences for a destination outside the British Empire; will normally be refused, as from a date to be notified, for any consignment of goods insured, whether for marine or war risk, by an Enemy company for the voyage to which the document applies. 2 . —(i) Shippers outside the United Kingdom: — An applicant for a navicert or certificate of origin and interest (or equivalent document), will, at the time of application, be required to (1) name the company insuring the consignment, and (2) if called upon to do so, produce a policy or cover note or certificate of insurance showing, in the case of the last two documents, the name of the companv insuring the consignment. If the information is not available at the time, the applicant must undertake that the consignment will not be insured by an enemy company, and must name the insurance company at least three days before shipment. (ii) Shippers in the United Kingdom: — An applicant for an export licence to a destination outside the British Empire must either (1) state that he is himself insuring the consignment with insurers carrying on business in the I nited Kingdom, or (2) name the company insuring the consignment. A shipper to a destination outside the British Empire of a consignment which does not require an export licence must, on the Customs pre-entry, either (1) state that he is, himself, insuring the consignment with insurers carrying on business in the United Kingdom, or (2) name the company insuring the consignment. Shipment of a consignment insured by an enemy company will not normally be allowed. An applicant for any of the documents mentioned above for a f.o.b. consignment will have to obtain the name of the insurance company from the consignee. 3.

Traders abroad who fail to take all possible steps to make sure that Consignments requiring any of the documents mentioned in paragraph 2 above are not insured by an enemy company will not only be liable to be refused such documents, but also facilities for trading with the United Kingdom, and British traders acting with or for them may incur liability under the “Trading with the Enemy” Act. o. traders in the United Kingdom are therefore advised in their own interest to bring the foregoing requirements forthwith to the notice of their customers or suppliers in neutral countries and, il necessary, to ascertain the name of the company insuring any consignment in which they are interested and confirm that this is not an enemy company. 6 . P or the purpose of this notice “ enemy company ” means either a company situated or incorporated in Germany or Italy or other enemy territory or a subsidiary company (in 'any country) of a company whose principal place of business is in enemy territory (see below), or a companv whose name is included in the Trading with the Enemy (Specified Persons) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 1941, S.R. and 0. 1941 No. 79 . or m any subsequent Amendment Orders made by the Board of 1 rade.
