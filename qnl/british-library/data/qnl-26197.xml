(digned) G.H. Baker 26/2. The general legal position is surely that military aircraft of any state have no right to fly without permission over the territory of another state. Mr. Vincent Evans. I gather that the Afghan Government complained of three air violations of the Afghan-Indian frontier by British military aircraft. In any event the proposed reply relates to military aircraft. The Convention on International Civil Aviation signed by the United Kingdom, India and Afghanistan at Chicago in 194^4 provides in Article 3 (c) that no state aircraft (defined in Article 3 (b) or including military aircraft) of a contracting state shall fly over the territory of another state - without authorization by special agreement or otherwise and in accordance with the ten s thereof. The Convention in this respect substantially repeats as regards military aircraft Article 32 of the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial navigation of 1919 to which the British Empire was a party, but not Afghanistan. The memorandum referred to in the British Legation’s letter . of the 14th February would not only appear not to answer the Afghan corr-i laint but would seem to amount to a repudiation of the practice laid down in those Articles of the Convention of 1919 and 1944* However the Convention of 1919 does not bind the United Kingdom or India in its relations with Afghanistan and the Convention of 1944 has not yet been -Satisfied by 26 states so as to bring it into force under Article 91, no^, I believe, have we yet been officially informed that the United Kingdom, India or Afghanistan have deposited instruments of ratification though I - am told that InaiiL-^ nd the United Kingdom were expected t o do so on 1st Larch last , nevertheless the Article may be regarded as express ive of what is generally accepted to be correct international practice as regards military aircraft and for a state which is a party to the Conventions to ignore that practice in the manner now apparently proposed would be improper and, from the point of view of international lav/, unsatisfactory. gree with Mr. Evans minute and suggest that we should write the Air Ministry making some of his points and obtain their news.

The Afghan Government cofiiplained of throe separate air violations of the frontier on the 26th, 27th and 29th of June, the last by a three-engined aircraft. Bayond saying that there are no three-e^gined aircraft in the L.A.F. or R.I.A.F. no answer is offered to any of tho specific complaints and instead I am requested to reply that M with the advent of long range high speed aircraft such as ths Tempest it will become increasingly difficult to prevent frontier violations 1 *, enu to say that navigational errors of much cs 20 easily occur. It is further suggested that I should say that pilots are unlikely to disregard the existing restrictions and that therefore such violations as do take place should be considered as purely accidental. In effect, so far from offering any explanation or apology, I am asked to inform the Afghan Government that more frequent and deeper violations of Afghan territory must be expected in the future and that no action is being or can be taken to prevent them. 2. In view of the fact that the Afghans are, as you are aware, extrema*ly touchy on these matters any reply that I give on the above lines, however wrapped up in verb*jge, is bound to cause the strongest resentment and it would in my opinion be better to give no reply at all (the ca.jas are already over 7 month* old) than to act as suggested by the Government oi India. If I am indeed to make such a communication I should be glad of more explicit inatmctions giving me as far *s possible the wording which it is desired that I should use. I would however suggest that before I am given further instructions the Afghan rights under international law require further consideration and it might be desirable that the Foreign Office should also be consulted.

Subject!- In continuation of my letter No.3582/748, dated uhe 31st August 1937, I have the honour to submit here with for favour of sanction by the Government of India a supplementary F.O.U.O. Programme of triangulation operations which is proposed to he undertaken by No.18 (Air Garvey) Party, Frontier Circle, in the North test Frontier Province beyond the F.O.U.G. line during the survey year 1937-38. 2. An index map and sheet Ho.38 in triplicate illustal ing the supplementary programme are enclosed. 3. It will be seen from the enclosed extract from the proposals for triangulation which were approved by the Chief of the General Staff, that the object of die triangulation is to enable the area in sheets 38 ii/10, 11, and 15 which are at present only covered by uncontrolled and inaccurate air survey, to be capped accurately. r ihe proposed triangulation, by making accurate air surveys possible, would save a great deal of time in any . uture road project in this area and would prove of great value in military operations. 4. The Chief Secretary to Government, North West Frontier Province, who was also aksed to communicate the North west Frontier Province Government’s approval to the proposed tri angulation, has requested the „azirforce, Razmak to dispose of the case as the matter is within the jurisdiction of G.O.C., Wazirforce, The latter officer has, however, informally approved the proposal, in discussion with the Officer in charge No.18 (Air Survey) Party, and the Chief of the General Staff2 Staff has requested the Headquarters, V/azir force, to make arrangements for the allotment of such kotor transport as may be required for the triangulation. 5. Tlie Resident in Waziristan in his letter No.778-3., dated the 8th September 1937, to the Officer in Charge, No.18, Party, a copy of wiich is attached herewith, has confimed that the project mi$it be possible in November. The Officer in Charge No. 18 rarty, is therefore now in correspondence with the Resident in the matter, and as soon as his permission to send the triangulation party is received by the Officer in Charge, it will be despatched pending the formal sanction of die Gkivemment of India to the programme* -Supplementary F. - '• U. 0• Pro^raznciQ of Survey Operations of the Survey of India for 1937-38.

Sir, I AM informed by the Air Ministry that they have under consideration a scheme to encourage foreign touring by air among pilots of the Royal Air Force and of its reserves. The Air Ministry consider that the practical experience of air routes and air navigation, in foreign countries in which these pilots may in certain circumstances be required to operate in time of war, is of the highest value from a training point of view. This experience cannot be obtained by the pilots in their service capacity to the extent desired. On the other hand the cost of Hying in foreign countries is too high to permit more than a small percentage of pilots to obtain such experience in a civil capacity. k 2. In these circumstances the Air Ministry have put forward the proposal that a subsidy of 25s. for each dying hour should be granted to pilots of the Royal Air Force and its reserves in respect of dying carried out privately by pilots in civil aircraft over foreign countries. This subsidy would not cover commercial dights. 3. I shall be glad to receive your observations on the general desirability from the political point of view of this proposal in the light of the special conditions in the country in which you reside, and of the probable attitude of the Government of that country towards requests for permission for dights of this character, where such prior permission is needed. In considering this question you will no doubt take the opportunity of ascertaining the views of the Air Attache responsible for the country in which you reside.

It would in the first place be very diffieult to explain to the Afghan Government the reasons for su ch a concentration on their border, the only obvious explanation of which would be that it is a preliminary practice in the event of war with Afghanistan, Even if it were possible to remove all such suspicion from the minds of the Afghan Government the operation would still cause muon embarrassment to them, since local Afghan opinion would regard their complaisance as further evidence of subservience to British influence and the opportunity of anti-Hadir propaganda would be taken advantage of by the supporters of Am&amp;nullah, Moreover, were such a concentration to taketake place it would certainly result in complaints from the Afghan Gowermaent that their frontier had been yiolated and as you are aware one such complaint regard ing the Chaman frontier is now under infestigation. The Government of India agree with the views expressed above and regret that they are unable to sanction the proposed concentration. 3.

No action is, I think, necessary on Kabul despatch No* 43 dated 17th March, 1932, below. In approving the G. of I.'s proposals we pointed out to them that if the measures taken do not after all prove so successful as is anticipated, the question will of course be open to reconsideration. Sir R. Maconachie will in all probability have received a copy of our telegram (of 22 nd 1 arch) to the u* of I. from the latter in the ordinary course. Para. 8 of the Kabul despatch refers to the G. of I.'s proposal to define, the presumptive frontier on their maps as accurately as possible, and thereafter to treat it as if it were part of the Durand Line, i.e., to observe a prohibited zone of the same width there as elsewhere. This probably means thati' they propose, for their own domestic purposes, uo consider the presumptive frontier, when thus defined, as equivalent to the Durand Line. It does not seem necessary that they should make any announcement to the Afgh&amp;n 8 ° n subject, and unless the definition of the presumptive frontier is unduly unfavourable to^^^an pretensions (so that R.A.F. machines would be seen frequently flying to a hitherto imusual /*v^ H depth in Mohmand country), it seems conceivable that ^ ^ the Afghan Govt, may know nothing about this^provisionalj A b’ lr*LJ / _ A. — . * ' definition. aJ' &amp; J St (A StUA Hhff 'O' 7i JV.ii 9 Q / (. i C-v ✓ 0 ■j VWv.

The rules referred to by the G. of I. are quite distinct from the instructions regarding the control of operations, including the of air forces on the North West Frontier, which haye'been the subject of correspondence on another file.—^ ] These rules relate to peace flights, and a copy of them as they stand at present will be found at the foot of this file. Besides the free zones specified in the rules, the Afridi country in Tirah is now open to peace flying as a result of the Afridi settlement. As the G. of I. state in their letter, the operations of 1930 have very greatly extended the tribal territory open to free flying. Last summer there was d.o. correspondence between the British Minister at Kabul and the G. of I’s Foreign Secretary arising out of the increasing frequency of accidental violations of the Afghan frontier which were necessitating repeated apologies to the Afghan Government and were naturally embarrassing to Anglo-Afghan relations, but At the same time the G. of I. were contemplating a reduction in the depth of the prohibited zone along the demarcated Durand line from \lvo six to three miles and, permission of flying right up to the presumptive frontier in Mohmand country. The F.O. demi-officiaily strongly supported Sir R. Maconachie as to the necessity of preventing violations and suggested that we ought to be consulted before the prohibited zone was reduced. The G. of I accordingly now ask for the approval of H.M.G. to a rule reducing the prohibited zone to three miles from the Durand line and from the presumptivepresumptive frontier in Mohnand country (a smaller reduction in the latter respect than they had previously contemplated). Their letter sets out a reasoned case for their proposal. It is designed to enable the R.A.F. to exercise to the fullest possible extent the freedom of flight over tribal territory which has been gained as a result of recent operations, and at the same time to ensure every possible precaution against violation of the frontier. They suggest that there are good grounds (despite any appearance of paradox) for anticipating that the latter object as well as the former will be helped rather than hindered by a reduction in the depth of the prohibited zone j because pilots, if their flights are not unduly restricted, will obtain a fuller knowledge of the terrain and thus become better able to avoid accidental vioifl&amp;ptiS, This appears to be a not unreasonable conclusion^if the necessity of caution is impressed on personnel by simple regulations. With the latter object, additional flying instructions have already been issued, an extract from which is attached to the G-. of Ids letter. So long as the importance of taking all tise possible measures to avoid or reduce the number of violations of the frontier is recogiised (it is impossible,of course,to guarantee that no such incidents will occur) / it is a matter for the G. of I and their expert advisers to decide by what precise methods this object is attained; and if they are satisfied that it can be attained with a reduction of the prohibited zone we may accept their conclusion; we are chiefly concerned with the end in viewnot with the means taken for securing it. V This was recogaised in the d.o. correspondence between Mr. Howell and Sir R. Maccnachie (see the passages marked * in© S3 Minute Paper. Department. r u \ \ 1 19q2 J - .4 1 ]t in blue pencil flagged A) and this is the proposition which is referred to in para. 7 of the Gr. of I’s letter i as having been accepted by the Minister. Violations of the frontier, to judge from the ' papers received here, have already decreased since last t ySSr? It is submitted that we should approve the Gr. of I’s proposal, but perhaps we should first ascertain officially whether the Minister has any observations. Of course if the means proposed for J attaining the end in view should not after all be found effective, the matter could always be reconsidered.

Sir, I am directed to invite your attention to th' correspondence ending with Mr. Walton T s demi-official letter No. P, Z.&gt; 5805/31, dated the 18th September 1931, 2. As you are aware the revision of the rules which govern mi.xi tar.v aviation in the North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan has for some time past been engaging the attention of the Government of India. Military aviation in these regions is divisible into two categories, according to the purpose for which the flight is undertaken, viz. (i) peace flights, (ii) operational flights. The Government of India have on all previous occasions regarded it as within their own province to lay down such instructions as they thought fit as to the manner in which flights of these two classes should be conducted. Cn.the present occasion however it was made known) to them that some of the conclusions which they had tentatively reached did not commend themselves'0*39^ $ *° Hls Majesty's Uinistes? at Kabul. Ir, view of v.e extreme sensitiveness of the Afghan Oovemiaent in resyeot or anything which can he construed as constitut ing even an unintentional infringement of the independenc •lud integrity oi Aighanistan and the importance of avoid- lng frlctl °n wherever possible with Afghanistan, the iovernment of India recognise that it is incumbent upor them to consult this officer when framing regulations cr. this subject and to give due weight to hia opinions and to the international aspect of what wouii otherwise be a matter of purely domestic concern. They therefore ininn proper on the present occasion to seek the approval of his Majesty's Government to the rules which, after consultation with Sir Richard iiaoonachie, they rev.' propose to issue. ine present reference is concerned with peace flights only. Operational flights have been separately considered and a copy of the latest provisional instructions in respect of them was forwarded to the India Office under cover of foreign Secretary's letter Ko. 108-M. , dated the 6th August 19.51, It . is unnecess; . at present to say more about them than invite your attention to Rule 13 of those instructions in which stress is laid upon the paramount importance of inter- n ft 1 1 on on oon siderati on s . 4 ’ In respect of Peace flights it is unnecessary to trouble ills Majesty’s Government with conoidcration of tne proposed rubes from any but the same aspect. ?he operations of 1930 practically opened the whole of -ri ni territory in the Hortb 'best Vrontiei Provinceso far as tribal objections are to 'free flying' concerned and the Government of India feel that they have a right for the aircraft of the Royal Air Force stationed in India to enjoy to the fullest possible extent the liberty of action over tribal territory thus achieved, and that it is much to their interest that this right should be so exercised* They also recognise that they have an international duty to dis charge in the exercise of this right and that it is incumbent upon them £like from considerations of propriety and self-interest to take every possible precaution against violation of the Afghan frontier by Royal Air Force machines. The attempt to reconcile these conflicting principles has brought into prominence two questions viz. (1) what should be the width of the 'prohibited zone' running down the eastern side of the Durand Line, which must not be entered Yy aircraft without the special permission of the Government of India, and (2) what special rules should be made in respect 'of that portion of the frontier in which the position of the Durand Line has not yet been determined. The undetermined portion of the line (or 'presumptive border'), as you know, is confined to a small sector in Mohmand country. 5. Hitherto the Government of India have insisted upon a six-mile prohibited zone, the maintenance of which necessitated a number of exceptions and the definition of a series of corridors leading to places of importance ¥ withinwithin six miles of the Afghan frontier. At the same time it^failed bo prevent not infrequent violations of that frontier, and the 3-overnment of India have consequently been led to undertake a re-examination of the whole question. The conclusion which they have reached is that their desiderata, as set out in paragraph 4 abo^e, being stated and known, it is for their expert professional advisers to devise the means whereby these can best be secured. By these advisers they are assured that the maintenance of a prohibited zone whether of six^or any lesser width is a comparatively minor matter, arid that to obviate violations of the Afghan frontier they must rely more upon increased precautions by the Royal Air Force, greater simplicity and uniformity of regulation, and the fuller knowledge of the terrain which can only be secured if pilots are not unduly restricted in flying over it. The Air Officer Commanding in India, with the approval of His Excellency the Ccmmander-in- Chief, has accordingly issued additional service flying instructions (an extract of which is attached; and it is proposed, at his instance, to abolish the easting six-mile limit vich its corridors and to substitute for it throughout a uniform prohibited zone thr a e miles wile, with only orA exception. This is in the neighbourhood of Cnaman whore our machines have for long been accustomed to fly right up to the frontier without protest from the Afghans. This may seem a somewhat paradoxical conclusion, resembling the abolition of the speed limit for motor cars in the United Kingdom in the attempt to make tetter provision for the safety of the publi'V Nevertheless the Government of India are satisfied that the arguments upon which it rests are ^ourd and propose to give it their appi'ova 1.6 . As regards the second question, the G-cvernment 01 * India propose when once the photographing and mapping of this section of the border are complete, to define the '''pre- sumptive border' 1 on their maps as accurately as possible and thereafter to treat this as if it were part of .the Durand Line, i.e- to observe a prohibited zone of the same width as elsewhere. 7 &gt; A copy of this letter and of its enclosures is being sent to Sir R, Maeonachie, who has already intimated unofficially his acceptance of the main proposition on which the revision of the rules now contemplated rests viz. that, the requirements of the Government 01 India being known and admitted, it is for the Royal Air Force in India, with the concurrence of the General Staff, to frame their own measures for compliance with them. 8. A copy of the revised rules in respect of peace flights which it is now proposed to issue accompanies this letter and I am to ask that the approval of His Majesty’s Government may be accorded to them.

I should be grateful if you would kindly show this explanation to Sir John Steel. As you sugfest, the fact that the Royal Air Force have made worse errors in Europe than they have in India has a distinct minus value in argument with the Afghan Foreign Minister, and instances from the air services of other lowers are clearly what is wanted. Meanwhile I have looked through the file of the 1 Times* for May last, with the result given in the enclosure to this letter. r ?hls rather scrappy information tends to show that violations in the form of forced landings at any rate, are in rkirope not always ’calmly accepted as inevitable*, and are not infrequently resonted. 4. But the actual circumstances with which we have to deal-as distinct from my own wild and unimportant ideas - are those which arise from the hypersensitivener.s of an oriental State. (Cf.

It is perhaps not always realised that whatever his private feelings towards us may bs ^adlr Shah is compelled to be more prickly officially, than Ajnanullah TOian was, in all matters oven remotely affecting the independence of his country, since he is constantly charged, as iimanullah3. never was, subservience to British interests. Similarly it is to oar advantage, apart from all questions of Treaty obligations, to avoid any appearance of trading upon his general friendliness. 5. Sir John Steel suggests two arguments for use with the Foreign Minister; the first based on the ground speed of aeroplanes* snd the second on the liability to error of an untrained observer. Both these, I can assure him, are kept T on io®' in this Legation, and the only question is how often they can be employed without losing their force. The first I have used twice in conversation with the Foreign Minister during the past year; the second has been familiar to rae at any rate since January 1924, when,as a reference to Afghan Series XTIJ, Serial ITo.7 will remind you, it was employed by Parsons. In my last letter to the Foreign Minister (written before Sir John steel’s suggestion reached me), you will notice I have used it again. 6 . Paragraph 3 of your letter of July 13 cites the ratio of 4 violation^to li million miles of flying in tribal territory. This sounds all right at firet, but not so convincing on further examination. Flights in tribal territory might be a very long way from the Afghan border, and in paragraph 8 you suggest that T should induce the Afghans to be T ’as reasonable elsewhere as they already are in the neighbourhood of Chamair • This means I suppose that violations have occurred near Charaan, to which they have not objected. The danger of using such anargunent is obvious ; mid incidentally it rather undermines the argument of the 4:1,500,000 ratio. I fancy that the recent lack of complaints from the Baluchistan and wazirietan borders nay be possibly due in part to a difference in circumstances on the Afghan side in these sectors, and that when Afghan organisation is as far advanced there as it is in the 'iastom irovince, complaints will begin to eome in from these regions too. I hope I may be wrong in thinking so. 7 . I find the distinction drawn in your letter of July between ’peace flights’ and ’operations’ difficult to appreciate. I do not know if the Government of India have notified the cessation of ’operations’ on any particular date, but certainly did not realise that any operations continued up to the date of letter IG/24/l.Air 1, Headquarters Wo.l (Indian) Group, dated 25th November 1930, which refers to the reconnaissance area including Land! T Giana. In fact the note dated July 6 , 1931, by the Air Officer Commanding, on the duration of air operations during 1930,see©» to Indicate that such operations were definitely over before November# However in future I suppose such a distinction will have no practical significance since the Government of India, are no* prepared - as they have not hitherto been - to accept the argument that pilots should not be asked to operate In war in areas over which they have not flown in peace time. 8 . own attitude in regard to the zoneis quite correctly stated in paragraph 4 of your letter of July 13# Hitherto a six mile zone has been regarded by the Government of India as a necessary evil. The Government of India now consider that it is an unnecessary evil; and I only wish to suggest that the arguments so iar adduced in support of this view are entirely unconvincing. But I am, of ccurse, only concerned with avoidance of violations of the Afghan frontier the means adopted by the Government of India to obviate such violations do not really interest.me, so long as they are effective. 9 .

I hope this will give Howell something to go on, though I notice his letter of July 21st refers to the attitude adopted by a European Government on the unintentional violation of its territory by foreign aircraft; and to incidents in which the Air Force of some Foreign Pov/er has been trespassing into Great Britain or some other country. I believe there are not many instances of such violations on European soil - but if you think that Howell would be interested to have more instances than those contained in the accompanying memorandum will you let J.C.

In 1926 the Turkish Ambassador in London drew attention to certain alleged violations of Turkish &lt; » territory on the Turco-Iraq frontier and expressed the hope that the necessary steps would be taken to prevent * &lt; their repetition. After investigation of the facts, it was explained to the Turkish Ambassador that it appeared that no violation of the frontier had taken place by British aircraft. It was also pointed out that it is far more difficult to judge from the ground whether air craft are over a given line or not, than it is from the air, and an offer was made to arrange for a flight by a - t Turkish officer in a British aeroplane in order that the difficulty should be appreciated. t 3. In February 1927, the Turkish Ambassador complained that in January two British military aeroplanes had crossed the Turco-Iraq frontier and penetrated into Turkish territory for a distance of some 40 kilometres. Shortly before, the Turkish Ambassador had also made a proposal for the prohibition of flying within 5 kilometres on either side of the boundary. The Turkish Ambassadorwas informed that, after enquiries, His Majesty’s Government were satisfied that no British aeroplanes did in fact cross the’ frontier. His Majesty’s Government were also unable to accept the proposal regarding the prohibitions of flying within 5 kilometres of the frontier as this would involve the isolation of certain frontier posts. An % assurance was added that the greatest care would be taken to ensure that K.A.F. aircraft did not cross the frontier. 4. In February 1930, the Turkish Ambassador complained of a violation of the Turkish frontier near Cizra, by a squadron of aeroplanes, which had been fired on by a Turkish military pbst. Enquiries established that British aircraft had not crossed the frontier and the Turkish Ambassador was in formed to that effect. It was also again pointed out that it is practically impossible to judge the position of aircraft correctly from the ground. 5. At the same time, a protest was made in re- ' gard to the statement that the aircraft were fired upon. The Turkish Ambassador was informed that His Majesty's Government could hot but view with concern the possibility of shots being fired in time of peace at foreign aircraft inadvertently 'crossing the frontier of a neighbouring and friendly state,and the consequent risk to the life and safety of the aviators concerned.

Tlie Turkish .Ambassador was further informed that three British aircraft on February 17,1931 had accidentally crossed the frontier near Faish Khabur and penetrated some ten miles into Turkish territory. The Ambassador was asked to convey to the Turkish Government an expression of regret on behalf of His Majesty’s Government for this accidental violation of the frontier and to inform them that the necessary measures had been taken to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. II Persia. 7. On September 3G, 1928 the Persian Minister of Court complained to His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires of the violation of the Persian frontier by three R.A. F. planes and said that the Government would issue orders that in future planes guilty of such acts would be fired at. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs also addressed a note to Mr. Parr asking for an explanation of the violation in question and for the punishment of the offenders. 8. Mr. Parr replied to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs' on the basis of information received from Sir Henry Dobbs, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq. It appears that one of the pilots in ques tion, who was new to the district, lost touch with the other two planes and in ignorance of the frontier line crossed it to a distance of some two miles. Sir Henry Dobbs expressed regret for the violation of frontier which was made quite inadvertently. • * « « 9 ♦ • • •9. Mr. Parr informed the Persian Minister of Court of Sir Henry Dobbs 1 explanation and at the same time expressed the hope that, in the circumstances the instructions to the local authorities with regard to firing might be modified. 10. Sir A. Chamberlain also issued instructions to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran that as regards the proposal to fire on machines violating the frontier he should take a suitable opportunity to inform the Minister of Court orally of the surprise with which His Majesty's Government learned of a* proposal so completely at variance with the custom of civilised countries and should express the hope that any such &lt; * instructions tttould be cancelled. 11. In January of last year, another protest was received from the Persian Government regarding the crossing of the frontier by aeroplanes, accompanied by a threat that in the event of further similar incidents 'the frontier officials would perform ♦ their mission'. Pending information from the Iraq authorities regarding the alleged violation of frontier, Sir R. Clive at once took exception to the Persian threat of firing. Sir R. Clive pointed out that to open fire on a machine that had inad- vertently crossed the frontier would be to commit an act unheard of among civilised countries at peace and would be fraught with the very gravest consequences. 12. As the result of enquiries into the Persian complaint, it was ascertained that a formation of British military aeroplanes had inadvertently crossed 'n E 5555/24/34/ 1928. E 372/371/34/ 686 1930.the Persian.frontier. As soon as the mistake was dis covered, the formation turned and recrossed the frontier. While expressing regret for the inadvertence, it was pointed out that it was impossible wholly to guard against the recurrence of such mistakes in future. Sir R.Clive, however, assured the Persian Government that British military aeroplanes have no wish whatever to trespass over Persian territory and every effort would always be made to prevent such inadvertent trespassing. He also relied on the Persian Government bringing to his notice all adequately substantiated complaints as soon as possible after the occurrence of the incidents to which they referred. Confl.13548 No.39. Confl. 13548 No.37. Ill Ne.id-He.ia3, 13 . in 1928 Ibn Saud, in a letter to the British Agent at Jeddah, protested against the crossing of the frontier by three aeroplanes from Transjordan. In handing the letter to Mr. Jakins, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs said the King had instructed him to make a strong protest verbally. The crossing ol the frontier by aeroplanes was a breach of sovereignty and an assurance was pressed for that a repetition would not be permitted. 14. Mr. Jakins was instructed to reply that an aero plane had inadvertently flown over Kaf while proceeding from Amman to Bagdad, owing to the pilot mistaking the Kaf track for the Bagdad track. His Majesty’s Government much regretted the occurrence and steps were being taken to mark the proper route and to guard against a repetition of the error. 15....Conf1.13548. No. 52. Confl.13785 No. 13. E1727/387/25/ 1931. 15. In his reply to this explanation, Ibn Saud stated that not one but three aeroplanes were con cerned and asked for a re-investigation. From de tailed reports subsequently received, it appeared that.Ibn Baud's statement was correct. The British Agent was instructed so to inform Ibn.Saud, again expressing the regret of His Majesty's Government for the incident and for the subsequent misunderstanding as to the exact nature of the occurrence. 16. On May 10th 1929 two Royal Air Force air craft from Transjordan inadvertently crossed the Nejd frontier near Kaf. The British Agent at Jedda was instructed to express the regret of His Majesty's Government for the occurrence. 17. In a note of April 5th 1931 the Hejaz-Nejd Minister for Foreign Affairs protested against British aircraft flying over Hejaz-Nejd territory and request ed the punishment of those responsible. In his reply, E3022/387/25/ 1931 Sir A. Ryan gave an explanation of the alleged viola tions and added that if the Hejazi Government should receive information regarding specific cases of the frontier being crossed by British military aircraft, His Majesty^ Government would be prepared to inves tigate such cases on receipt of exact particulars as to the time and place at which they were believed to have occurred. 18. In May 1931, thd Hejaz Government complained of the visits of British service aircraft to Darin E2694/2303/91/ Island, protested against this infraction and request- 1930. ed the punishment of the offenders. It was explained E4050/2/91/1930. to the Hejazi Government that the visits were limitedE5159 5281/2303/91/ 1930. E2987/1592/ 25/1931. to the time and extent necessary to supply spares and carry out technical adjustments in connexion with the Hejazi wireless installation. Sir A. Ryan regretted the vigour of the language used in the Hejazi protest, but at the same time recognised that there was a technical omission in not obtaining the assent of Ibn Saud before the visits were made and stated that this would be done on future occasions. 19. In September 1930, a flying boat from Bahrein to Basra landed in the Persian Gulf owing to engine failure and taxied into the shelter of Abu Ail Island. The necessary spares were flown out by another flying boat. This incident was not the subject of protest by the Hejazi Government but the facts were spontaneously communicated to the Hejazi Government by His Majesty's Chargd d'Affaires. 20. In May of this year the Hejazi Government complained that British aeroplanes hovered over Jinnah Island and Jubail on their way to Bahrein during the period May 15th to 18th. After investigations had been made by the British authorities, Sir A. Ryan explained to the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs that the report on which his protest was made must have been erroneous. Sir A. Ryan had also previously drawn attention of the Hejazi Government to the well-known difficulty of estimating from the ground the exact position of aircraft flying at a helgit. Sir A. Ryan also assured the Hejazi Government that it was entirely contrary to the express instructions of His Majesty's Government that British aircraft should violate Nejdi territoryterritory and that they were prepared to investigate any incidents reported to the Hejazi Government.

I am writing you like this 'because I think that if the Minister at Kabul could frankly explain what I hare written here to the Afghan OoTernment # it would remove a good many imaginary causes of friction. E. There is one more point to which I would call your attention, and that is the difficulty of getting accurate reports as to the exact position of an aeroplane relative to the ground at any given moment. Even in England with trained observers on the ground it is very difficult to get accurate reports* It must be remembered tnat am aeroplane flying at, say, 10,000 feet appears overhead to a large number of people, who may he separated by a considerable distance. The only real way of getting an accurate reoort is to tell the observer to lie down flat on his back. He will then know whether the aeroplane is actually overhead or not. As I have already explained to you, I propose in every complaint that we get to give the result of our first investigation as quickly as possible without waiting for the final investigation. I am afraid that in the past we have allowed too long a time to elapse between receiving the complaint and giving our reply, and this has quite naturally given the wrong inqpression that we are not doing as much as we ought.

A twin-engined bomber» flying from Suffolk to Kent 9 got lost in the clouds and eventually flew over Prance and Belgium, subsequently landing in a field in Holland. In this oase, the Dutch authorities allowed another twin engined aircraft to fly from England to Holland and land on an adjacent aerodrome 9 in order that a more responsible pilot might take the aircraft which had forced landed into the air, as the field s a small one and the operation, therefore, rather difficult. The necessary petrol was supplied by the Dutch authorities, who also provided every assistance in handling the aircraft on the ground. No protest was received from either the French or Belgian authorities, and, of course, the accident was immediately explained to them. 2. October, 1929. A single engined bomber got lost during a local flight from an aerodrome in Kent and subsequently landed in Prance. The French authorities in this case allowed another aircraft to be flown from England to Prance to give the necessary assistance. 3. November, 1929. A flight of three single seater flighters got lost above tne clouds and subsequently landed in Pranoe. One of them crashed on taking off.The French authorities gave permission for a party of R.A.F. mechanics to collect the crashed aircraft. 4. April, 1931.

On the apparently fairly frequent occasions when foreign territory has been unintentionally violated by our Air Force at home correspondence has presumably passed between His Majesty’s Government and the foreign Government concerned.

Let me begin by admitting that sufficient attention had not been paid here to the oreaendo of \fghan irritation over unintentional Tlolutioua taeir frontier by British aer'Plane* and toe consequent «eriouanees of toe present position. I will also admit to&lt;-1 in the past there ha* been a tendency to regard an expression of regret as sufficiently liquidating each incident aa it arose# 3. In paragraph 10 of your letter you suggest that if Afghanistan had been a first class ^o^wer effective methods would have been found to prevent the occurrence of such violations. X am assured on the authority of Sir John St^^l# that there is no ground for any such i aputation. Uninten tional violations of their coiamon frontiers by the aircraft of contiguous Powers are, it is -understood, no uncoat oc occurrence in Europe and are in most cases calmly accepted as inevita*&gt;1 e in the present stage oJ- dsvelop:iient »v ii ch aviation h&amp; s reached.

Moreover flying conditions in Europe are nowhere anything like es &amp; difficult as over tribal territory and there is no mountainous region in the world which is so tucu flown over. If therefore**^Afghan Foreign inister aho ild again draw the inference in discussion ith you that because in the course of 1930 • during which t,he ^oyal Air Force flew about one and a half million miles over tri bal territory - the frontier wi, s inadvertently crossed f )ur ti!iB8» the Royal Air Force must be lacking either in discipline or efficiency* it is hoped that you will consider yourself in a position to rebut the argument. 4. That however is by the way. Your main contention that violations of the Afghan frontier by British aero planes constitute a breach of Treaty and that it is of the first importance in frontier flying to avoid such viola tions is one frora which the Oovernuent of India have no inclination to dissent. It is therefore only a question of method. It is perhaps natural for you to express surprise that in the circumstances it should be proposed to reduce the width of the prohibited sone and that this Depart nentof India should be prepared Department of the OoYemnent to agree to that reduction. The explanation inrolTea the introduction of the personal factor to an extent which I must ask you to pardon. It was not until I visited Peshawar at the end of January last* after your visit to India* in connection with the proceedings of the Tribal Control and Defence Committee that I realised that the rules relating to illitary aviation on the horth tfest Prontier and Baluchi atan( Ar ny Department tfo. l57oa/ll/3- a.S. I*0.-1* d^ted the 13th :fove iber 1930)^ which in this respect do not differ from earlier rules^were not regarded by either service or by the Chief Comni ssioner as applicable to flights undertaken in the execution of operations* but only to what may be called peace flights. That seemed to me to rob the maintenance of the zone which admittedly had not proved a very satisfactory device for keeping the frontier inviolate* of at least half its importance* if not iwre. 1 also found the authorities of the two services anxious either to abolish the prohibited zone altogether or at least to substitute the permission of the Chief Commissioner korth '^est Frontier Province(or Agent to the Governor General Baluchistan) for that of the Govern*Rt of India as the condition precedent for flying in the zone* I discussed the isatter fully with theca j in all its bearings* as also with Pears* and persuaded them of the necessity for leaving things as they *«re in respect of the authority whose permission was required for flying in the prohibited zone* This seemed to me more important than the actual width of the zone* As regards that* I think that Pears was right when he saidi- 'The matter is really one for the Air Officer Commanding to decide and if he is satisfied that the increased experience and efficiency of txie Royal Air Porce makes a 3-mile limit from the Durand Line sufficient to reduce to a minimum the chance of trespassing into Afghanistan* then on general grounds X think that a 3-mile limit should be accepted' • It also seemed to me preferable to get an agreed solution* which I did* subject to the reservation that you must be consulted and full weight given to your views* These have now been received in your letter under reference and the vigorous expression of them which it contains has fully convinced/ convince d both the Coaj»nder-iR-Chief a nd the Air Officer &lt; t4U) Coxainanding of Uie necesBity for tighten^ap control, i believe that# if you expresced a strong desire for it# they would agree to the retention of the six iile limit# but X infer from paragraph 10 of your letter that you agree with Pears and oyself that now that the position has been clearly explained and understood the Air Officer Comroanding is beat left to do his own job in his own way. b. So much for peace flights. As regards operations no one here questions the view that a a much care# if not more# is necessary to provide against violation of the Afghan frontier in the course of operations as in other flying. But the Govern lent of India do not think it fair to agk the Royal Air Force to operate over ground with which they have not had all the opportunity that they require to familiarise themselves. I^or can they accept the proposition that villages within six miles of the Durand Line should in practice be virtually immune from attack by air. They think that it will make for exact compliance with orders if these orders are mads ao simple and uniform as possible and there are many places (e.g. Sheranna in Jadda Khel Wazlr country, the Shoreshti Bala inin Taji Khel ^azir country# China and ialai in t fc Bazar valley and place a in the Upper Bara in Tirah] wiiCu &lt;»y be within six milee of the frontier, but are certainly not within three. Operations against any of these 1 ght at any tia» have to be undertaken and it seeifts therefore undesirable to let theta remain within a prohibited zone. 6. As regards the presumptive line I would draw your attention to the Government of India’s telegraa Ho. , dated the 15th August 1930 in which the position of the Government of India is correctly stated, ifot only are they prepared to sanction air operations against the Safis in the last resort, but as a matter of fact air operations nere actually carried out (by the Chief Comaisaioner on his own authority) in Safi country, when on the 5th June 1930 Lakarai was bombed, without a word of protest from the Afghan Government. They are obviously very v.gue as to topography in that region and even when in 1908 Sarobi was entered by British forces without complaint from Kabul they n*»de no complaint.

It is perhaps pertinent to observe that of the violations which took place in the years 1930 and 1931 none occurred in .«ziristan, where the Royal Air Porce hate had complete liberty of movement for several years* whereas in the Khyber and Tirah regions where flying had been severely restrictedrestricted until last summer» at least four complaints were made of shich one» if not two t were admitted# Sin tnia area tne mapftnen existing were undoubtedly vague- as to tiie raain features whicJn would assist Pile - to pin-point their position.

It is true that the cause of violations hare «e-t actually specified the incorrectness A _ of the Jiaps* but it has been owing to the absence of detail on them which has made accurate air pilotage impossible and the exact location of the border line difficult to determine from the air. io doubt this )i%iy also have been a contributory factor in earlier violation^ 8.

As regards the suggestions that the rules might be amended so as to reduce the prohibited zone from six to three miles and make flying in Mohmand country permissive up to the presumptive frontier, the G.of I.would doubtless consult the S.of S.before the rules are altered. We agree with the F.O.as to the desirability of such consultation if alteration of the rules is still contemplated. It would seem prima facie doubtful whether it is desirable to alter them in the directions suggested unless and until experience shews that the H.A.F.are able to avoid violations of the frontier under the rules as they stand. As regards the recent frequency of incidents we are also in general agreement with the F.O.

We feel quite sure that everything that is possible is being done in the Foreign Dept. Much probably depends on the stringency of the instructions issued by the R.A.F. While we appreciate that the difficulties of the country must be very great, we do feel that in view of the rule which prohibits all flying within six miles of the Durand Line it 4 ought to be possible forflying officers to avoid any violation of the frontier.

(K 4553/4056/97) Dear V/alton, Maconachie has sent to Seymour a copy of his secret semi-official letter of June 6th to Howell about the embarrassing position in v/hich he is placed by the recent repeated violations of the Afghan frontier by Royal Air Force machines. We entirely sympathise with Maconachie’s point of view; and we agree that it is really impossible for him to go on offering to the Afghan authorities the well-worn apology and promise to amend, while the incidents complained of tend to occur ever more frequently. In the circumstances we share the apprehensions aroused in him by the proposal of the Government of India, referred to in Howell’s letter to him of May 25th, to reduce the zone to the east of the Afghan frontier, into which our machines are not supposed to penetrate under the present regulations. C. Walton, Esq., C. B. , M.C. . ffi&amp;iregulations. Indeed, in view of the important issues involved, it would seem that the Government of India ought to consult you before any decision is reached to amend them. It is difficult to understand why the Royal Air Force are not more successful in avoiding occasions of offence if they really wish to do so; and it is not surprising that the Afghans appear to have arrived at the conclusion that the British pilots concerned are either insubordinate or inefficient. In any case it seems to us that the existing state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. As regards the treaty position, to which Maconachie refers, Article 1 of the Anglo-Afghan treaty is only material in that by it we recognise that Afghanistan is an independent state and possesses all the rights incidental to such independence. Article 1 of the Air Navigation Convention provides that 'The H.C.P. recognise that every Power has complete and n exclusive sovereignty over the air space above its ’'territory”, and Article 32 provides that 'no military 'aircraft of a contracting State shall fly over the 'territory'territory of another contracting State nor land thereon 'without special authorisation'. Afghanistan is not a party to this Convention, hut Article 1 is a statement of a general principle, which had in fact heen accepted before the Convention was drafted, and of this principle the rule in Article 32 is the necessary consequence. permission by Royal Air Force machines over territory which we admit to be Afghan involves a violation of Afghan sovereignty and a breach of international law, and we cannot insist too strongly on our point of view that every endeavour should be made to put a stop to them. In this connexion we welcome the Government of India’s telegram of July 4th, containing a definite pledge to attempt an improvement; and we should be glad to learn as soon as possible the exact nature of the steps by which the Government of India hope to prevent any repetition of the incidents. There can be no doubt that flights withoutSECRET. BRITISH LEGATION, KABUL 6th June 1931.

In your telegram 706«£* dated Daoerabar 29 # 1930, I was informed that further enquiry was being made, and that no referenoe had bean made to tha GoTerranent of India for a modifioat ion of tha order in question. Tha report of Headquarters lo.l (Indian) Group, dated Horeraber 20, 1930, stated that the Chief Commissioner, Horth^West Frontier ProYince, and the General Officer Commanding, Peshawar District, had authorised contravention of the Government of India’s express orders on the subject. The circumstances in whioh this was dons ware stated to be under enquiry. 6. In. January I dlsouesed the whole subject with you in Delhi, and also with the Air Officer Commanding (Sir G.Salaond) whom I found extremely sympathetic with »y point of view, and ready to admit that our continued failure to respect the Afghan frontier was as shortsighted from a practical standpoint - as it was unjustifiable from the legal. I gathered that you also accepted my statement of the case, and understood from the fact that you signed the following note on January 20, 1931, jointly with me, without recording any point of disagreement, that the Government of India were prepared to take action more or less in accordance with it:« j?o»18. yiolatlone of the Af g han frontier by aerop lanes. ” Such violations are not only indefensible but are ’ seriously prejudicial to our own interest# particularly as regards development of satisfactory air relatione with t he Afghan Oovormaamt» They also involve a * ot f f rce4 ^ a ndlngs in Afghanistan, with at jjgP 1 ® deal of unnecessary trouble and anxiety reconnaissance up to Landl Khana, apparently in' to All ooncernad, and at worst - a not Improfeafels ' worst - a painful tragedy and International ' difficulties* Minister hopes that the n slx mile' ” limit will be not asrely confirmed but also enforced ' in praotloe* '3d. K.BiHowell, 20.1.31• '3d. R.R.ltecoaaohle, 6. This statement of the situation, as 1 see it, will perhaps explain ay surprise at the proposals made in your present letter. In the absence of detailed inforaation I cannot help wondering whether they do not originate with ^ars. For there is hardly one of them which I have not heard expressed forcibly, almost word for word, at Peshawar, by either Pears or Brook. The only point of difference is In respect of U&amp;ndi Xh&amp;na, but since it is only 'for the present' that the Government of India 'forbear to authorise free flying to Land.1 Khana', this discrepancy will not be permanent, and the conformity of views will then be complete. If this surmise is correct, I hope it is hardly necessary for ms to say that I bear Pears no ill-will whatever for putting his views as forcibly as he can, and inducing the Government of India to aoeept them. That is of course hie Job; his concern is with the 'trees'’ and the Government of Ix^la's with the 'wood' - and it Is the letter which seems to me to have dropped out of sight. 7. To come to the several points made in your letterI do not of course question the correctness of this fctatesrtmt, but a possible inference from it. y 1 k « 9 that the riewe expressed in your letter are the result of laet ye&amp;r’e operations would clearly be incorrect* Hxoept in regard to flying on the Hehmand border. Pears has held these views for many years past, ae one or two extracts from previous eorraspondcnoi will show Paragraphs 3(a) and 4 of your letter may be compared with his memorandum Ho*827 of August 5, 1922:- * It is most unfair to call on flying officers * to bomb areas which are either not mapped at ail 9 * or else so badly mapped ae to be practically ' unrecognisable, and therefore the more aerial ” photography of unmapped areas is done the better ” will be the result of any offensive action from the ' air* Thus, unless there are other and weightier ' considerations involved, every encouragement should ” be given to the Royal Air Force to get acme personal R knowledge of mapped areas across the border and 11 take a sufficient number of photographs of unmapped * are&amp;e'* ' uset ion 12 - Xn^almesa to the Koyal ~ir :-’orce * the existing prohibited zone for air reeonn&amp;leeanee * should be contracted as much ae possible* It is * not fair to aak pilots to bomb umexplored and * unmapped areas*** And his reply to the Government of India questionnaire dated /uly 30, 1923:- It will be noticed that Pears* views admit the possibility of other weightier oone1derationeItirolwl, although I cun find little indication in your letter under reply that these are non appreciated • Paragraph 4* ' Indeed it ie thought that rlolationa i n the past have In part arisen frog the fact that oT?i ng to restrict lone pilot e were not familiar with t he country near the T/arand line, and for the game reason efficient aapa could not he laade * • I am not of course ooapetent to criticise any argument which la based on purely technical grounds but this particular one happens to be completely refuted by the reporta made by Koyal Air Force officere themselves in the cases of actual violations in the psat« In not a single one of the nine violations shown In the enclosed statement was the cause found to have lain In the incorrectness of the maps* Nor does this argument square with the fact that there has been in existence for several years past a line six miles Inside the Durand Line, which the Koyal Air Foree have had ample opportunities of photographing and with which they are pretiumably familiar* If the argument were sound, one would expect to find that the inatanoea in which this inner line had been unintentionally crossed would become less as time went on Instead of more numerous, as is actually the case. I do not aeo how familiarity and aerial photography can be expected to save the Durand Line from violation, when these aids have proved inadequate in the case of a line six miles inside it. The wording of your letter however suggests that this argument is not very seriously intalned.9 ********* 4 * ' ±4*&gt; ta tht fur»t propo»*l thf. 0«T&gt;n»«nt JagU jt old that action »nat aow A*, yogarded m ••••••••••••••••• » fan ootlvlty whic h £ 1 ° «_At 1 tb«r ty. »11 hi a if pop Xmadarloo . to eyoro loo to «uoh oxtoat oo It a«y dooo aopoo—yy »cd pro per * 1 * Paragraph 5. lh» Oovernment o f India &gt;« within fehalr rl^hta in urid^rti^klitf air operatIona aimlne fe . ?hie statement aoema to tm to ba only a half- truth* for aurely it la a coRtsonploca of both otmlolpai ana International law that the exerclsa of righ^a le aubjeot to the fulfilment of obligations t this principle seems to hold 50 od whether the question la^firlng an air gun la a back garden* or of jiimirj practice by a battleship at ee&amp;« It alao governs the present case* 8 y Article I of their treaty with Afghanistan Hie Majesty's Govern^nt 'certify and respect all rights of external and internal independence' of Afghanistan, A violation of the Afghan frontier la an infringement of Afghan rights of Independenee* and it therefore appears to follow that the Government of India are precluded from exercising *®jr r i&amp;hfc t which been proved to lead In practise to a breach of this Treaty obligation to Afghanistan* Paragraphs 3(b) and 5, 'Mohmand terr itory*'.

XXI,141). I &amp;» not aware of any such change haring taken place in the situation on this sector as would account for so complete a change of views. Vis-a-vis Afghanistan the position is ths same now in this p&amp;rtioular respect as when these views were expressed, and I should have thought that other possible 'complications' were, at any rate until a settlement is reached with the Afridls, even more important now than they were then. 3. It is however the concrete proposals made in paragraph 6 (iJ and (ii) of your letter which show how completely I have failed hitherto to make ths Afghan attitude in this matter clear to the Government of India. As regards (i). There is no mention of s British aeroplane in the neighbourhood of the frontier being regarded as a menace. The point is that a violation of that frontier by a British aeroplane constitutes a breach of the Aagio-Afghun Treaty.( f A«rl«l Tlolatlona which art contrary to law’; Afghan Fortign Office letter of 29th Faroh 1931, quoted abort, end cf. the reference to •Treaty obligations’ in A#S* XTII, 264) As regards (il)* It would be most inadvisable In ay opinion to inform the Afghan Govern*snt that there it any prohibition imposed by the Government of India on flying by the Royal Air Force as far as the Afghan frontier, for the following reasons (a) In a recent conversation on the subject which I had with the Afghan Foreign Minister he indicated how hard he found it to piece any faith in the continued assuranoee offered him by the Government of India that all possible precautions were being taken to prevent violation. In reply to my efforts to convince him that the Government of India meant what they said, he suggested that if this was so t and instructions had been given to the Htoyal lir Fore# authorities as often and as clearly as they had been stated to have been, then only two possible alternatives remalneo; British pilots must be lacking either in discipline or efficiency. This is, I think It will be admitted, a not unnatural and an extremely undesirable conclusion for the Afghan Government to draw from the facts, and If they draw these unfortunate conclusions in ignorance of the further fact that a six mile zone has bean prescribed by the Government of India as a margin of error, one can imagine what the effect on them would be if they learned of the existence of this limltotion ; and realised that whenever these vlolatiens eesur car pilots, instead of being a few yards out oftheir course, r# in fact orer aix ailee off iti (fc) The oooona reaeon la that the Afghan Covornraent would be likely before long to quote the existence of a prohibited eone as evidence that the Government of India have no right to fly up to the :urand Line. For a parallel to eueh an attitude one need only refer to the capital made by Afghan officials out of the phreae 'independent territory* as formerly used in our official publications, and their olai» that it constituted an official admission on our part of the legal independenoa of the tribal belt. 9. I$y cwn view la that there la an abaolute Treaty obligation, overriding all questions of looal interest, to respect the Independence of Afghanistan. His ife^eety's Government is therefore bound to take all precautions necessary to prevent any breach of this obli i m. In the past the six mile sone hf been considered to beaneoassary precaution, but it not proved sufficient. There seems therefore to be no case for the reduction of this sons to half its present breadth. 10. But, as usual in our relations with Afghanistan, there is no real conflict between the At a time when the Afghan Government have a Russian air service operating in their country and are negotiating with a German aviation firm, it seems to be a matter of the first importance that they should observance of our Treaty obligations and our wider (as distinct from purely local) material interests. be filyen no oauae for ^oeatlonine the good faith ofHia &amp;aj«sty f a aovernwont la oonneotlon with aerial matters, or for doubting the efficiency or discipline of the Royal Air Force* Although some of the violations which have occurred in the past may have been entirely unavoidable, I am convinced that if the Durand Line formed the boundary between India, and (instead of Afghanistan) some European Power such as France or Italy, effective methods would very soon have been found to prevent the occurrence of such violations, and in prlnslple there is no dlfferencs whatever that I can see between a treaty obligation to Afghanistan and one to a European Power* fhat these methods should be, it Is clearly not for me to suggest; but if the object In view can be attained by other means than the retention of a prohibited tone, I see no need for retaining ouch a sons* But In any ease the first re ulsitee would appear to be that both sides of the question, the frontier and the international, should be clearly appreciated, and that the Government of India should insist on the strict observance of euoh orders as they might pass In the light of euoh appreciation* The present state of things in which instances of violations are increasing, and each case appears to be regarded as settled by a stereotyped apology la not at all satisfactory, and is certainly prejudicial to our interests in this country* 11 * I apologise for the length of this letter. My excuse is the vital importance of its subject from the standpoint of our relations with Afghanistan, I am sending a cony of it to tsince, r.a I think, the fulfilment of our Kresty obii,:atlone ia directly involved, to the Foreign Office hIbo# Aa the first Foreign Minister said in connection with the first aerial violation of the Afghan frontier :• * You write about the •Government of India* apologising for this Incident ••but it is not a question between the Government of India and the Governuant of Afghanistan; it is one between the Government of Great Britain and Afghanistan'* Yours sincerely, R.R.Maconachie. -(BY AIR ?TAlX) tic Dated the 25th May 1931* and Baluchistan, a copy of which was forwarded to you with ray letter ho* ]?.640-5 1 /27, dated the 4th December 1930 o 2* The revision of these rules is now again under consideration by the authorities concerned in the light of last year r s experiences, and I am desired to address you with reference to it. If you will refer to Memoranda ho^, 4 32-323-Jpfand 433-328-5’, dated the 13th Hay?'and 7th June respectively 1923 addressed to your predecessors and the correspondence which ensued you will see that he was consulted officially on this subject and sent a reply in which he indicated some doubts as to the propriety of this procedure. Later in the summer however while at Simla he attended various conferences at which the rules to regulate frontier flying were drawn up and was a party to the decision whereby in that year the ten mile prohibit--. ed zone was reduced to six. 3. It is not intended to trouble you with any alterations unlikely to have any reaction on Afghanistan, but there sre some about which it is tnought proper that you should be consulted. It has been generally agreed (a) that Rule 1 might now be amended and the ibited zone reduced all along the ITorth-West Frontier depth of three miles only. Exceptions to the ded rule v/ould be that flying to Landi Kotal (if it is actually within three miles of the frontier) and Chaman would remain as at present unrestricted; iGN seck • . .70 toja 5 JUN. 19*31Cb) that in Mohamand territory flying should he permissive right up to the so-called M presumptive H boundary* 4* With regard to the first proposal the Grovernment of India hold that aviation must now be regarded as a normal feature of the life of nations and an activity which every Power is at liberty within its own boundaries to exercise to such extent as it may deem necessary and proper. The reduction in width of the prohibited zone offers certain advantages from the point of view of tribal control which the Government of India are not disposed to forego. It will undoubtedly tend to bring British aircraft more into the oroximity of the Afghan frontier than at present, but in the opinion of the experts entails little if any additional danger of actual violation* Indeed it is thought that violations in the past have in part at least arisen from the fact that owing to restric tions pilots were not familiar with the country near the ^ Durand Line and for the same reason efficient maps could not be made. Consequently, it is argued, if pilots are permitted to obtain a knowledge of the country from trie air the danger will actually be reduced. However this may be you may rely upon it that in cases where permission is given to enter the prohibited zone every possible precaution will be taken to avoid violation of tne Afghan frontier. 5. With regard to the second proposal the Government of India have as you know decided that in case of necessity they would be within their rights in undertaicing air operations against the Safis. Their attitude would be the same towards operations against any Ilohmand village not included in the Bohai Dag or inhabited by sections under Afghan control. It is of importance that the country should be accurately mapped and as much found out about its details as possible. There is therefore anan important reason for flying right up to the line for the purposes of photographic survey and thereafter there seems no reason why aeroplanes should not in peace fly over areas in which they may he called upon to operate in war or why a line of the actual course of which the Afghans may he supposed to he altogether ignorant should he treated with the sane respect as tiie Durand Line. 6. You will observe thst no exception has heen made in favour of Landi Khana* The Government of India while strongly of opinion that all military stations and all posts, whether garrisoned hy regulars or irregulsrs , should he at all tines accessible hy air provided of course that this can he done without actual violation of the Afghan frontier, for the present forbear to authorise free flying to Landi Khsna. In the neighbour hood of Cham an the flying of British aeroplanes right up to the Afghan frontier has become accepted as part of the normal routine and protests on this account have it is understood not heen nade for years past. I am to ask whether you consider it possible to discuss the subject of frontier flying generally with the Afghan Government and impress upon them not only the point of view above indicated in paragraph 4, hut also the facts (l) that the appearance of a British aeroplane in the neighbourhood of the frontier constitutes no menace to the Afghans and (2) that while determined to exercise their legitimate rights the Government of India c,re equally determined to avoid giving cause of offence to their neighbours, and for this reason in spite of some inconvenience to tne.*- selves have for the present restricted access to Landi Khsna on account of the sensitiveness of the Afghan authorities in this region. It night perhaps even be possible to reap some credit for this attitude and could at ary rate do no harm to let the Afghans know how the position is viewed here.It must of course be recognised that occasions v/ill arise in 'which it will be necessary for air craft to enter the prohibited zone. But it has not yet been decided whether the permission necessary for this is to be that of the Government of India or of the Chief Commissioner. For flying over tribal territory east of the prohibited zone in permissive areas, (i.e. arecis in which permission is required) that of the Chief Commissioner will be sufficient. I am to request that the Government of India may be favoured with your comments on these proposals. 9. The question of the revision of the rules regarding flying in connection with aerial operations is being considered separately along with the other proposals of the Frontier Control and Tribal Defence Committee. 10. ** copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office.

The first, found predominantly between folios 102-224, is about complaints made by the Government of Afghanistan over violations of its territory by aircraft of the Royal Air Force, and complaints made by HM Minister at Kabul that the Government of India does not take the complaints seriously enough. The file therefore contains details of these violations, investigations undertaken into complaints, and any action taken by the Government of India in response: for example see folios 208-12. It also contains a number of memoranda outlining examples of territorial violations by aircraft from the rest of the world for comparison: see folios 165-68, 159-60, and 149-51.The second topic, also found predominantly between folios 102-224, is about periodic amendments to the Government of India's rules for pilots flying in the North West Frontier. The most significant change is a reduction of the extent of prohibited zone — an area around the Afghan-Indian border within which aircraft are not supposed to fly — from six to three miles. The file includes related discussion as to what impact this could have respecting the number of accidental incursions into Afghanistan.The third topic, predominantly found between folios 4-101, concerns aerial photographic survey work to be undertaken along the Afghan frontier in Baluchistan and the North West Frontier Province. The file includes proposals for survey work from the Surveyor General of India, correspondence respecting the suspension of the prohibited zone, and notifications of proposed survey work provided to HM Minister at Kabul. A map showing the areas in India prohibited to civil aircraft can be found on folio 95.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Kabul; the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India; the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India (from 1937 the Department of External Affairs); the Government of India Department of Education, Health and Lands; the Surveyor General of India; officials of the Foreign Office; and officials of the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Surveyor General</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>North-West Frontier Province</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Surveying</topic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial navigation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airspace (law)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001ea#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
