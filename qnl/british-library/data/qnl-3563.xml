Note dated 5th April 1943 by Mr.E.B. Wakefield, I.C.S. Political Agent, Bahrain. , Conditions in Saudi Arabia.(Received under Bahrain DoO* Letter No.C/477 dated 7*4.43) Conditions in Saudi Arabia Dr. Storm and 3£r. Van Peursem of th« ^merifcan Mission at Bahrain have recently returned from a medical tour in Saudi Arabia in the course of which they spent six weeks in Riyadh. Mr. Van Peursem reports that 9 so far as he could see, food, including rice, was plentiful. He said that prices were high but that, as the labouring and servant classes received their pay in food, the high prices did not greatly affect them. He saw no signs of starvation and heard no complaints about lack of food. 2. Dr. 3torm confirmed what Mr. Van Peursem had told me independently. He thought that the general condition of the people was good. The only persons who appeared to be suffer ing were the Bedouin whose flocks and camels were in poor condition owing to lack of grasing during past seasons. He said that there were very few beggars in Riyadh and that th*. •suq 1 there had many things not available in Bahrain e.g. soap, toilet requisites and similar articles of every day ue* 3. Dr. Storm said that everybody in Riyadh appeared to be in good spirits as a result of the excellent war news. He said that general feeling was in favour of the Allies. Hatred and contempt of Italy were universal. There appeared, however,'to be apprehension about Russia^ future policy and power. Ibn Baud mentioned to Dr. Storm durirv; each of five or six interviews his expectation that Russia would demand a commercial outlet on the Gulf after the war. According to . Dr. Storm views in Riyadh about Russia had been greatly Influenced by the fate which had befallen a Russian diplo matic or consular representative at Jedda and a Russian lady doctor there. It is believed in Riyadh that these two Russians were M put out of the way* on their return to their country because they did not hold advanced communist views. 4. Dr. Storm said that Bashir Syed Alawl is the closest to the King of his counsellors and has most influence with him./- n- 2 - G *7 r * ^ 4 * ^ - L v vKi nlwai he« strong fesllngs ©boot the Intsrvsntlon of ioroignors in ^udi Arabian affairs* ?hough he considers all foreign influence evil he thinks thf British are less to be distrusted than other foreigners* 5* &gt;tom was aoazed at the way in which the &gt; ing 9 In spite of his advanced age, still retains all power exclusively in his own hands anti delegates no authority to any one - not even to the Crown Prince* Kot only does he listen avidly to news collected from the radio broad* casts of foreign stations but he takes e personal interest in the smallest item of news from any part of hie own extensive ue*M ituriea* 6* )r* Storm told me that I bn &gt;«ud gave him H 1900 as a foe for the medical services he had endered.
