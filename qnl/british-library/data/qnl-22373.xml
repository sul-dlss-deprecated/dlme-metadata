POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, 18th November, 1951. * 4 * ¥‘ In my letter (C41/3/44/61) of the 31st October = I informed you that the 20 rifles ordered for the Ruler of Kalba were to be handed over to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. This has now been done, and the purchase price paid by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, namely Rs.4270/9, is now held by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, 2. Now Shaikh Hamad had already deposited Rs.3000/- r / % in the bank against the price of these rifles and Afed ttlla Awazi, his agent, paid in the balance of Rs.1270/9. Presumably Hs.1270/9 should be returned to Abdulla Awazi; but I should be grateful for your advice on the disposal of the remaining Rs.3000/-. It is in fact a question of how Shaikh Hamad’s estate is to be dealt with. 3. The sum of Rs.3000/- is the only liquid asset of which I am aware. On the other hand Shaikh Hamad ap pears to have owed a good deal of money. Wilton has received claims from one teuhasmed Ismail al Afghani of Sharjah for Rs.1290/8 and from Abdulla Awazi of Dubai for Rs.12,000/-, against which he holds a mortgage from Hamad on 40 shops in Kalba and Khor Fakkan. No doubt other claims would be presented if the impression got about that there were any likelihood of their settlement. WhllilfO** On the 29th August Pally warned Wilton against = suggesting in any way that we should be responsible for the late Shaikh Hamad’s debts. Row, however, Wilton' holds this asset of Rs.3000A Oo you think we should instruct the bank to hold this sura pending the appoint ment (with our approval) of a successor to Shaikh Hamad, or should the sum be handed over to Abdulla Awazi as Shaikh Hamad’s former agent, and incidentally, so far as we know, his largest creditor?

Bahrain Agency letters Nos. 022/6/40/31 and C22/6/43/51 21st and 25th October respectively and Wilton's letter No.0220/67/51 of the 20th October. The Foreign Office's most recent instructions are contained in their despatch No. 142 (EA 10111/2) of the September. As Felly has pointed out it will be easy to turn Saqr bin Sultan out of Kalba but difficult to control him once he has sir l * par^roTj^n ny despatch No.9^ (10112/19) of the 25th July, r think he should be in constant touch with meukers of the fami y includin^Sultan^hin Salim over this s^Ject and that he should endeavour to bring about a situation 'hereby Saqr bi ' S;-atan ^ Ka ^sLir^bin*Sultan*oaOTO^be^tried°under^he ^in Co^l ^£^ f fr s r^rtt c- STaf^er in Hamad's place. Personally I «uld not prelude the possibility of recognising the murderer’s father Sultan bin Salim m Ruler of Kalba if the family were to recommend it, though I would much prefer some other course. 2 We have already put a certain amount of pressure on Saqr bin Sultan by refusing to recognise him and by asking Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) to withhold payments due under their Kalba concession. Wilton should do everything he can to increase this pressure by action in the political and economic fields, of. paragraph 2 of Felly’s letter of the 21st October. Should action on these lines fail we may have to resort to force and I have already asked the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf to arrange for one of His Majesty’s ships to have a look at Kalba and to consider what action could most suitably be taken. W.S. Laver, Esq., The Political Agent, Bahrain. Sei-lu*/- -M- -jm-kxjblki/*!® &lt;£&gt; With the compliments of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah. T© The Political Ajent, Bahrain. Sharjah, 21st October, 1951.6 ) Confidential. British Agency, o^%o Sharjah, 20th October 1951 Jt't&amp;.r f^ope -r/' &gt; Yeu asked me t# let you have my recommendations for an operation for the deposition of Saqr bin Sultan from the position which he has usurped in Kalba, and I am forward ing them to you direct in order that you may have an opport unity to discuss them with Major Rankin-Turvin should you wish to do so. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Political Agent, Bahrain. 2. The operation should, to my mind, aim equally at the eviction of Saqr from Kalba and the prevention of his taking refuge at Huwailat or Munai*. If we accomplish the first without the second, we shall probably be faced with a further and more difficult operation to dislodge him from the mountains. This will be especially necessary if we wish to re-establish the connection between Sharjah and Kalba, whether bji making the latter a direct dependency of the former, or by installing a member of the Sharjah ruling family as Sheikh of Kalba. The second aim admittedly presents difficulties, but they are no greater than would be the difficulties of a subsequent mountain operation, and I think that we should from the outset try to do everything we can to make the latter unnecessary. 3. I propose that we should try to pass a force of Levies through the Wadi al Qaur, and that I should accompany them with the notice to quit which you wish to have served on Saqr before further steps are taken. I should in the first place try to convince him of the advisability of yielding and accompanying me back to Sharjah without provoking us to extremes. To this end I could, if you see fit, state that we had no wish to pursue the question of his murder of his cousin, and that our aims were limited t* removing him from Kalba and from the opportunity of further interference in its affairs. If we were successful in passing Huwailat a message to that offect eould be sent back radio or car to Sharjah, where I should like tfte warship to wait. It could then go as quickly as possible to the area of Kalba. If we were not able to talk or rush our way past Huwailat, we should have to return to Sharjah and all proceed by sea. 4. If we succeed in reaching Kalba, but I am unable to make Saqr see reason, the actual threat of force would be brought home to him by the arrival of the warship. If it became neces sary to use force, I consider that I should still be in a better position to control its application, and even at that late stage possibly to secure the person of Saqr, than I should be if I were, for instance, on board. I should suggest keeping the Levies His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., encamped on the / Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. Jk ./4 7/-encamped #n the air-strip, which is a reasonable distance t# the flank in the event ef a bembardment. Frem there I sheuld maintain wireless cemmunicatien tx with the ship, which weuld enable me te call eff the bembardment at any time te receive a surrender, g# in pursuit ef Saqr if he attempted t# flee, •r fellew up any ether change in the situation fcith the least delay* 5* If, despite all our efforts, Saqr managed to get away into the mountains, he would do so either on foot or on camel, as we should control the only motor road, and in that case there ought to be time for the Levies to get back through* the Wddi before he could reach Huwailat* We should then have to plan a fresh operation to drive him out of the mountains f If the Huwailat positions were already strongly held by the time thep Levies got there and they were unable to force their way through, they would have to return to Kalba where, I suggest, the warship should remain for some days both for this even tuality and to ensure security in Kalba* The campaign would then have to be mounted from the Kalba end* If an R.A.F. sortie were available (it would have to be previously reconnoitred) it could be summoned by wireless from the warship, and a further attempt could be made to clear the Wadi* If the Levies wireless link with the ship remained effective as far into the mountains as Huwailat, the whole problem would be simplified* The best . hope in my opinion however, is that a judicious presentation of s/ these/pmsintbiittiBX to Saqr at the outset would remove the need to employ them* 6. Meanwhile I think that the new Ruler or Wali of Kalba should have arrived in the warship with a sufficient armed force to enable him to take over and maintain security there. This raises the problem of supplying him with arms. Saqr will no doubt make off with such of the existing arms as he can if he gets a chance. At any rate it would be unwise to count ontheir being available for the new Ruler. If it is decided to put in a Wali under Sharjah, Sheikh Saqr could reasonably be permitted, I think, to use some of his airfield arms (if he has them by then), until more can be obtained. Otherwise it is difficult to see where the rifles would come from* There are 15 rifles held at th® Agency here in case of emergency, but I do not know whether this is the kind of emergency contemplated. We should want to be quite sure about there replacement with Mequally servieeable ones* 7* A further point is that if it should be possible for me to get hold of Sultan bin Salim before the operation begins and 1-imobilise him in Sharjah, I should certainly do so. We could decide afterwards what to do with him. 8* I realise that in many ways it would be simpler to take a landing party of Levies to Kalba by sea, but their use fulness there would be so restricted by their having no trans port that I think it worth the risks to try to get them there overland•Conf ickntial * 1 0220/^/51.

The nephew of Khalicl bin 1 hraad who lives at Dibbah, Saqr bin Abdullah, is, according to All Bustani, little better than the other nephew Huinaid, whose excesses resulted in his premature death last year. 3.

I attach as an Appendix notes ©n the possible candidates to be Ruler of Kalba. 3. The chief problem seems to me to be that the Jawasim regard Kalba as Jasirai territory, and would net willingly acquiesce in its alienation to either Fujairah or Muscat, but that they are themselves not strong enough to do anything about replacing Saqr bin Sultan. My own opinion is that if there were any question of Fujairah ©r Muscat taking over Kalba, the Jawasim might even make common cause'with Sultan Salim and his sons on the basis that a bad Jasimi is better than a n©n-Jasimi. I do not think that even then they would be strong enough to do anything effective, but the risk ©f further assassinations and intrigues would be increased, and traffic along the V^adi al Qaur might suffer. Though they stopped short of this, the Jawasim would never be happy about such a solution, and Sharjah in particular, who regards the separation of Kalba from Sharjah as only temporary, would resent it strongly. His solution is that Kalba ana Sharjah should be re-unitec , and Kalba ruler, by a Jali as another ©f Sharjah 1 s dependencies. 4. There is this much to be said for his plan, - that it would probably be easier to get agreement to it amongst the Jawasim than it would to the election of a Jasimi Ruler from the available candidates. The objections to the scheme are that Saqr clearly contemplates that we will bear the major if not the entire burden of carrying it out 5 that unless we could devise some way ©f preventing Saqr bin Sultan taking refuge in Munai’ when expelled from Kalba, it is doubtful if Kalba could be ruled by a //ali from Sharjah, and the system of ruling a remote province, to which access ^.s c ifficult, oy a v*a 1 i is in any'case open to criticism because ef the abuses to which it is all too likely to give rise ; although this would largely depend on the character of the Wall in question. 5. A Ruler independent of Sharjah might be found from amongst the Sharjah or Has al Khaimah ruling families, or, of course, in Fujairah or Muscat. ^ Has al candidate would be opposed by Sharjah, on the grounds given above, that Kalba is really Sharjah territory. The Ras al Khaimah candidates are in any case not impressive, nor would they get any material support fr©m their relatives, who are to© preoccupied with cares nearer home. The Sharjah candidates might not be acceptable to Has al Khaimah but the latter’s opposition could be fairly safely ignored. The only really . energetic candidate in the field is the Ruler of Fujairah, but even he is unlikely to act without our encouragemenu, • • • and if we give that,and if v/e give that, we shall, as I have said, annoy Sharjah. On the other hand, Fujairah as Ruler of Kalba would be far less embarassed than anyone else by the presence of Sultan Salim and his sons in the mountains, and it is for consideration whether the emergence of a strong and firmly ruled state of Fujairah-Kelba might not outweigh the disadvantages of even the Shaikh of Sharjah 1 s resentment.

Whether or not he would accept the job woulc depend largely on how easy or how dangerous it appeared at the time. His long-standing personal friendship with Sultan Salim would almost certainly lead him to come to an understanding with the latter. This might give him temporarily a firmer grip on the territory, but it would intensify his difficulties with his neighbour, the Ruler of Fujairah, and would be a bad influence on him generally. It would also perpetuate the Sultan Salim u interest' in Kalba and bedevil the succession whenever thet question c rose. Will not himself do anything in the matter. Would require the Sheikhdom handed him'on a plate' and considerable support thereafter. Has had experience of ruling and has private means. Kajid bin Saar . Brother of above. ~ respectable character, probably more energetic and straight forward than Meharaed. Played a prominent part in the return of the present ruling*family to Sharjah when Khalid bin Ahmad was expelled. Has been employed as a judge ef petty disputes and cases arising in the Suq. Has no private means and depends entirely on his allowance from the Ruler ©f Sharjah. Unlikely to d© anything to win Kalba for himself. Would probably cause less friction with Fujairah than any other candidate, attitude to Sultan Salim not known, but probably less favourable than Mohammed 1 s. a 1 id bin Mohammed bin Salim. Elder brother of Ruler of Ras al Khaimah. Probably the best ©f the Ras al Khaimah brothers, but is mainly interested in commerce and has shown little inclination to help the Ruler ©f Ras al Khaimah in his recent difficulties. Would require to be both put and kept in office, even if he were willing t© undertake the task. Humaid bin Mohammed bin Salim . Elder brother of the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah. A former candidate to be Ruler of Kalba in 1948. Appears tc have degenerated since then, if he ever was up tc standard, and now seems principally concerned with the pursuit of pretty girls. Has also notably failed to support his brother, the Ruler, recently. Would have to be installed by our efforts. Mohammed bin Hamad al Sharai.Ruler of Fujairah. The most attractive of the available candidates and the only one likely to do anything to help-himself. Appears to be a strong and able Ruler in his own territories, but has a longstanding feud with the Jawasim in generalAFIENDIX (G cntinued) Jawasira in general and with Kalba and .las al Khaimah in particular, as their territories have common frontiers with his. His acquisition of Kalba would probably unite the Jawasirn in protest. One problem about installing him would be the difficulty of communicating with him beforehand without it becoming clear what we were about.(C22/6/40/51) CONFIDENTIAL . POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, 21st October, 1951. Please refer to your letter (10112/34) of the 28th September and to our subsequent conversations about Kalba. In this latter laired my misgivings at the idea of forcible operations to depose the usurping Shaikh,not because I am opposed to the use of force in this case, but because I do not know what we could do with the usurper if he were deposed and whom we could successfully put in his place. I think he 'fould make trouble if left at large; his father’s record gives grounds for our supposing so. 2. The only proposal for action I could think of was that the Levies should get control of the Wadi al Qaur, per haps by placing a post at its entrance on the Jirri plain. They might then exercise 'economic sanctions'* by hdding up all caravans for Kalba,which would suffer even though it could be supplied by sea. If the usurper were then forced from to ask us to desist/any such measures we should be in a bet ter position to deal with the situation then than we are now.

I have now had full reports from Mr. Wilton, the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, on the situation at Kalba following the assassination of the ruler as reported in r'2.7 Residency telegram No.23 to Beirut. 2. It appears that this event took place on the morning of the 4th of July and not on the 6th as reported in my te legram, the mistake being due to a misinterpretation of the Hljrl date. Shaikh Hamad bin Sa^d was followed from his garden to his fort by Saqr bin Sultan bin Salim, Khalld bin Sultan, his brother, All bin Amir (former Secretary to the Shaikh of Fujairah and a Muscat subject) and Ramis, a slave of Sultan bin Salim, who was with him when he shot his way out of the Agency at Sharjah three years ago. They fol lowed the Shaikh to a room where he was preparing to sleep and killed him, his Secretary All bln Kazlm, and a young slave. With only four more men who were waiting outside, they then took over the fort. Saqr bin Sultan bin Salim then announced himself as Ruler of Kalba and got the notables of the place to sign documents stating that they had 'chosen” him as such 'without compulsion *by God’'! 3. Owing to the 'Id holidays, the news of the 'coup* did not reach Mr. Wilton until the 9th of July. He was unable to get to Kalba so as to coincide with the Wild Goose* s visit there about which I have received no detailed report. He did however set out for there on the 14th July, with an escort of Levies under Major Hankin-Turvin, and with Sultan bin Salim with him as security against being held up on the way. He describes the journey as follows: |'We camped for the night between Dhald and the mouth of the Wadi el Qor, and pushed on early next morning. We came to a road block at the track-junction below Munla*, which was manned by two armed men, and Sultan bin Salim's authority was sufficient to get us past this. At Huwallat a few miles further on, we found two strongly manned posts, one on either side of the valley, and the whole village in arms under the command of Khalid, Sultan's second son. This unprepossessing and excitable young man painted an alarming picture of the position at Khatami &amp;1 Malaha, where, he said, armed men were swarming on the hillside like flies, with orders to let no one pass. He claimed that they had shot at his own vehicle the day before, and that he had been unable to persuade them to let him pass. He said that his father had no authority with them, and that Saqr was angry with his father, and did not wish to see him. «tle took Khalld bin / Sultan His Excellency the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain Set- 2 « U/ y Sultan on board as veil as his father, and went on. At Khatam al Mai alia we found three men in a rude stone sanger, who fired a warning shot at the leading vehicle. An excited exchange then took place between them and Khalld, at the end of which he said that they would allow one vehicle to pass. I accordingly drove into Kalba where I encountered Saqr bin Sultan in the market place, and through All Bustani, told him to send a car to tell his guards to allow the rest of the vehicles to pass. I declined his offers of hospitality and withdrew to the airstrip, where we formed camp when the Levies came up.' 4. Hr. Wilton found Saqr bin Sultan in effective possession of Kalba. Of his meeting with him he writes * I also sent a message to Saqr to say that I wished to see him at 6 p.su He came out at that time, accompanied by his brother Khalid, All bin Amir, and about seventy fol lowers, all but three or four of whom were armed. As this imposing concourse advanced down the airstrip, Sultan bin Salim walked unobtrusively out of the camp in the other di rection and did not stop until he lad put about half a mile between himself and our visitors. His caution, if caution it was, was perhaps excessive, as there could have been few of the seventy rifles capable of firing so far. I took Saqr, Khalid and All bin Amir into my tent, and asked Saqr to state his case. He defended his murder of Hamad by saying that the latter had annoyed the Naqbiyeen by inqprisoning some of them, artf that they had complained to him, and he had righted the matter. He dismissed the killing of Hamad with the phrase 'Allah arranged his affairs'. I reminded him that there had been a treaty between H.M.G. and Hamad. He replied that he too was willing to have a treaty with H.M.G. and that he was 'a son of the Dowlah'. I asked about Hamad’s mother, sisters, and other dependents, and was told that they were safe and were content to stay in Kalba. I said that I would like to speak to them. Nothing that I saw of him during my visit led me to modify the opinions which I expressed in my letter _ / li±./- 0220/28/51 of 10th July 1951 to the effect that Saqr would make ' a most unsatisfactory Ruler in Kalba from our point of view. When he left, I took the opportunity of inspecting, with Hankin-Turvin, the assembly which had accompanied him. They were a very mixed bag and indifferently armed. The Shaikh of Fujairah’s followers, next day, said that they had been paid a small sum and bribed with a lunch to turn out, and many of them looked like it.' 5. Mr. Wilton adds that the inhabitants of Kalba and Khor Fakkan are as might be expected,despondent and apathetic and afraid to interfere with the quarrels of Shaikhs which they have come to accept as part of their normal lot. He was able to speak through closed doors to what was alleged to be one of the murdered ruler’s sisters, who said that she was all right as she was and wished to stay where her folks and property were. ' • 6 . Mr. Wilton is of opinion that we should not condone the usurpation of the rule in K&amp;lba and I am completely in agreement with him. He goes on to say 'The problem of what form our disapproval should take is a difficult one, but I do not think that the availability of H.H. ships or similar considerations should weigh In assessing / whether—whether or not we should voice it. It will produce a de plorable effect - on the tribes of the interior and the Saudis not less than on the other Trucial Rulers, - if we are not able to Intervene effectively when necessary in the affairs even of the frucial States themselves, and I think that every effort should be made to mount a combined operation to expel Sultan bin Salim and his sons from the Coast. If this can not be done because of lack of resources, the natural strength of Sultan's position at Munla' and the other factors we dis cussed, 1 am convinced that we should pursue all the measures which are open to us with the greatest vigour. We should withhold recognition, all payments and arms, and if either Fujairah or Sharjah show the slightest signs of wishing to intervene I think we should encourage them and back them. We should also do our best to get the other Rulers to disapprove and to take such steps to boycott Kalba as we can persuade them to. If Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited are worried about the future of their Concession, could they be persuaded to pay the sums due into an account in which they could be held until a new Ruler of Kalba is recognized? This would also have the advantage, if a new Ruler could be found and installed, of not starting him off with a completely empty treasury.” In a previous letter he had written H If ? as seems more likely, we are unable to lay hands on any of them, I propose to take this opportunity to summon the first meeting of the Trucial Council, and by exploiting the situation for all it is worth, try to get the Eulers to act together for once, outlaw Sultan bln Salim, and put a price on their heads. I shall try to insist that none of them ever permits the two, or any of the other murderers, to take sanc tuary in their territories. M 7. The first question which arises out of that of our at titude Is to be certain as to what we are taking up an attitude about. I suggest that it is the usurpation by force, and not the murder. It follows that it is Saqr bin Sultan bin Salim whom we must regard as the major culprit, although All bin Amir is undoubtedly a murderer. The part played by Sultan bin Salim is obscure though Mr. Wilton believes, and so do I, that he must have known of the enterprise. However, if my propo sition is accepted, action against anyone but the chief culprit must be regarded as of secondary Importance. 8 . Secondly,there is for consideration the measures which can be taken against the usurper short of arresting and de posing him. Of these I favour (a) letters from the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, to all the rulers expressing His Majesty's Government's grave disapproval of the usurpation, calling upon them to outlaw Saqr bin Sultan, and to have no relations with him; (b) stoppage of payments on account of the oil concession previously made to the Ruler of Kalbaf (c) stoppage of the supply of rifles to Kalba; and (d) any other sanctions of a non-forcible nature which suggest themselves. If Your Excellency approves, I will take action on these lines forthwith. I do not approve of any suggestion that we should encourage Fujairah, Sharjah, Has al Khaimah or any other Stateto interfere in K&amp;lba; the fact that there has been one forcible usurpation involving murder does not Justify our taking the risk of being a party to another. Nor do I think that this is an occasion for the first meeting of the Trucial Council 5 the rulers might well not co-operate and in any case are more likely to take the action required as a result of the letters which 1 have suggested should be sent to them by the Political Officer. 9. Thirdly comes the question as to what we are to do if we depose Saar bin Sultan bin Salim. (We obviously have to face this before we consider deposing him.) Wilton writes 'The problem of the succession Is serious, as Hamad has left no obvious successor, and the Jealousies between the other Rulers, notably Sharjah, Ras al Khalmah, and Fujairah will almost certainly vitiate both common action against the mur derers, and an agreed solution to the succession problem ,&lt; . To depose the present de facto ruler and then to leave a political vacuum is theoretically possible, but hardly fair to the wretched people of Kalba as it would probably lead to fresh disorders. My own experience of trying to provide c a Shaikh for Kalba in 1948 (cf. my letter D.O.No.C/R-156'of % the 21st August, 1948, to Colonel Galloway) is ’that it is a non-rewarding pastime. If therefore it is decided to de- i- pose Saqr bin Sultan w e will have to have ready a candidate for his place who is not only able to hold it, but will be acceptable to the people. Mr. Wilton should be asked to report as to whether such a candidate is available. 10. We come fourthly to the question of the mechanics of deposition. Mr. Hilton 1 s last word on this is w We could still dislodge him from Kalba without difficulty if we sent a force of Levies to arrive before a sloop by a few hours, so that the troops would get through the Wadi al Qor before suspicions were aroused.' This surprises me, because I had understood from Major Hankin-Turvin that the Munia f -fiuwailat-Khatam al Malaha po sitions are almost impregnable. Mr. Wilton should however also be asked to report on this, and to submit if possible in consultation with Major Hankin-Turvin a detailed plan for 1 have the honour to be.

I On the afternoon of 14th July, I set cut for Kslba with an escort of Levies under Major Hankin Turvin, and accompanied ey Shaikh Sultan bin Salim to ensure that no unpleasant incidents should interrupt us. On the way I met a vehicle with a letter for me from Saqr bin Sultan (translation enclosed) announcing his succession and claiming the support oi the leading^of Kalba. We camped for the night between Dhaid and the mouth of the Wadi el *or, and pushed on early next morning. We came to a road block at the track-junction below Munia f , which was manned by two armed men, and Sultan bin Salim's authority was sufficient to get us past this. At Huwailat, a few miles further on, we found two strongly- manned posts, one on either side of the valley, and the whole village in.arms under the command of Khalid, Sultan's second sen. This unprepossessing and excitable young man painted an alarming picture of the position at Khatam al Malaha, where, he said, armed men were swarming on the hillside like flies, with orders to let no one pass. ' He claimed that they had shot at his own vehicle the day before, and that he had been unable to persuade them to let him pass.

I declined his offers of hospitality and withdrew to the airstrip, where we formed camp when the Levies came up. 2 ‘ Sultan bin Salim refused to go into Kalba to see his son, and sat rather forlornly about our camp during our entire stay, we were visited in the course of the morning by one or two of the inhabitants of Kalba, who engaged in inconclusive talk with Ali Bustani, from which he was able to fill in some details oi what had happened. I also sent a message to Saqr to say that I wished to see him at 6.P.M. He came out at that ( time, accompanied by his brother Khalid, Ali bin Amir, and about seventy followers, all but three or four of whom were armed. As this imposing concourse advanced down the airstrip, Sultan bin Salim walked unobtrusively out of the camp in the other direction and did not stop until he had put about half a mile between himself and our visitors. His caution, if cautior it was, was perhaps excessive, as there could have been few of the seventy rifles capable of firing so far.

I said that I would like to speak to them* Nothing that I saw of him during my visit led me to modify the opinions which I expressed in letter 0220/28/51 of 10th July 1951 to the effect that woulc make a most unsatisfactory Ruler in Kalba from cur Point cl view. When he left, I took the opportunity of inspecting, with Rankin Turvin, the assembly which had accompanied him. They were a very mixed bag and indifferntly armed. The Shaikh of Fujairah's followers, next day, said Ij that they had been paid a small sura and bribed with a lunch H to turn out, and many of them looked like it* 1 3. In the evening, Ali Bustani went to see what he could get from the local merchants, and also tried to see Hamad's sisters, but Saqr refused to allow this. The merchant,' community was unforthcoraing and apathetic. They wer&amp; told that if they had signed Saqr's letter under duress, they could either speak or write to me and tell me their real views. Their attitude apparently is one of despondency and pessimissm. Since the death of Shaikh Sa'id bin Hamad they have known little but upheaval and misrule, and they have no hope of anything else. One Shaikh, they consider, is much the same as another, and they have little faii faith in any change producing an improvement in their affairs. A certain amount of disgust is voiced at the fact that Saqr was Hamad's guest when he killed him, but even that arouses little feeling amongst the ordinary folk, who seem to expect their Shaikhs to be a lav; unto themselves. Certainly no one is prepared to risk his personal safety in a gesture. 4. On Monday I went to Fujairah and Khor Fakkan. In Khor Fakkan the attitude was much the same as that in Kalba, - apathy and resignation, and a general disinclination to commit XHXxnytklHgxx® themselves in anything so dangerous and uncertain as a quarrel amongst Shaikhs. Fujairah, as might be expected, produced some more interesting reactions. In the course of a long dissertation on his wish for a treaty with us, Shaikh Mohammed managed to insert a direct question as to what would be H.M.G's attitude 'if he were attacked by anyone, or attacked anyone or were provoked or the victim of an aggression'. I xnssxx answered only the first and last parts of his question, saying that whether we had a treaty with him or not, we had a long standing friendship with him, and would not wish to see him made t-he victim of an unprovoked attack.^ He was unwilling to enter into any moral judgments about the Kalba 'coup' (judge not that ye be not judged?) saying simply 'These things will happen'. In conversation with his followers, the Levies gathered that he had made all the necessary preparations to intervene in Kalba, but had not done so because he did not know how we would receive such an action. Nothing was said to enlighten him on this point, but I gained the impression that it would not take the broadest of hints to set him in motion. Cn the other hand, he also announced his intention of going to Karachi soon to have his eyes attended to. His eyes looked all right to me, and I am told that the real reason for his visit would be to obtain treatment for chronic syphilis. 5. On my return from Khor Fakkan I went to see Saqr, who received me in the room which was the scene of the murder, and repeated my wish to ascertain from Hamads sisters whether they were in fact willing to remain in his protection. After a good deal of fuss, I was permitted to speak to what was alleged to be one of them through a closed door, and she said that she was all right where she was and wished to stay where / her folks and propertyher folks and property were. I was not altogether satisfied / with this, but saw no obvious way of pursuing the point,^so I contented myself with warning Saqr in. firm terms as I left, that whatever the future might hold, about which I could say nothing, he should be careful that eusote no one else’s 'affairs were arranged' as Hamad's had been.^ He repeated his assurances that all were free to come and go as they pleased and his statement that he was a son of the Dowlah. I said that the Dowlah had many sons, and knew how to distinguish between those who trod the path of justice and righteousness and those who went their own ways* 'v 6 . The salient facts of the situation at present are that Saqr, has successfully executed a boldly planned 'coup' (he h-d only eight man with him* besides his brother and Ali bin Amir)'and th-t success has had its usual effect. The most that can be expected of the inhabitants of Kalba is a cautious awaiting of further developments. The murder of Hamad was cunningly conceived from almost every point of view. The 'Id distracted outside attention and provided a breathing space for consolidation. The large sea-going dhows had just returned from Africa and India and paid their dues, and the tobacco tax had been collected, with the result that it is estimated that Saqr took over some 30,000 - 40,000 rupees. The Naqbiyeen have apparently been won over by some real or imagined grievance against Hamad, and are said to support Saqr, for what that is worth. The control of Huwailat and Khatam al Malaha places two obstacles which by local standards are very formidable, in the path of possible interference from the South and West, and unites Kalba and its inland communications under one Ruler for the first time in many years. Similar evidence of planning and attention to detail was in evidence in other respects. The seventy f armed followers, however Lol|i©w a facade in fact, made ^ quite a brave display, and spoke with unconvincing unanimity of their loyalty to Saqr. They had been^well drilled. I expressed some doubts about the well being of Barood, the former head guard in Khor Fakkan, now replaced by Sultan bin Salim's slave ..amis, and he was thenceforward paraded ostentatiously armed to the teeth, and used as a go-between in my dealings with Hamad's sisters. Theeldest sister|s son about whom I was also concerned, a child of about eight, dressed up in a clean shirt, 'happened' to meet me in the market and promptly greeted me, so that I should ask who he wasj 4/^jl cj&amp;q 7. There is some doubt in my mind, however, whether Saqr is in fact the master-mind behind all this. His appearance is not impressive, he often gave the impression that he was repeating a well-learnt lesson, and his general demeanour is one of weak craftiness rather than determined ruthlessness. He did not stomach very well some ofmy more direct references to the murder and its possible consequences. To a certain extent this is borne out by accounts of the crime culled from local sources. Ali bin Amir is generally held to have been the moving spirit and, according to one account, when Saqr hesitated to kill Hamad and seemed disposed to think that it would suffice to keep him in prison, Ali clinched the matter by shooting Ali bin Hazim, after which b aqr deciaea that there was /-4- there vc .s nothing: for i t hut to go the v.hole v:ay. All ‘bin IA inTr \;as not very prominent during my visit. He v;rs nr^se^t on the first two occasions when I met Snq-r, &gt;vnt said nothincr. and at the third meeting he was represented h~ &gt;n's younger brother S' 1 id* who hears a marked esembla.noe to him. Despite his avoidance of the lim-'iiixHt, All bin Amir conveys an impression of force of ** character and ability qnite lacking in S a qr, and those r renorts Which att' ihute to him the leading role in the whole affair are probably co rect. I was unable to find n.nv o+'her convincing reason or occasion for the murder than the nersonal ambition and greed of All bin Amir and of his +nni S«qr. °. The part of Sultan bin S^lim is obscure* and it mav well be that the enterprise was carried through with o’-'t hig approval, though I cannot believe that it was wit &lt;vt hi s knowledge. He was present in Shariah when Saqr purchased arms for the expedition here* his guards went with the murderers, and his sla.ve -amis was one of them. H^ prohablv advised, against the ptoiect and was overruled by Ali bi^ 1 Amir, with the result that he now finds himself i*n - •nositio'n of some difficulty. He did not see or speak with hi a son d^rincr my visit, and the latter is said to hp-n-e threatened that if I had in fact come to a rest him, hip first act would be ti kill his :'a+-her who had brought me ihere. Somewhat to mv surprise (l had expected him to Hr* 0 p off at Huvailat or Hunia*^, Sultan returned all the vrv to Shariah with ns, and has now asked for a passport, a* h e wishes to moke the pile-rimage. I think it better that he should be out of the country at present, and pro - nose to give him a visa for Bahrain, where you will no doubt he able to a-ra/nge to see him on his way through if you wish. This way all be nart of''some elobo ately subtle act, but if so,I am at a los* to see, where it tends. 9. In conclusion, I shoi’ld say that Raqr was expec ting some more forceful intervention on our ; art than we h~we so far wade, that he was seriously worried by the ap pearance o^ E.K.S. Wild G oose on the morning of the loth, and expected that the Levies would appear simultaneously fnow the other direction (hence the re-inforcine of K hatm al Malaha the dav before our arrival* as reported by Khalid bin Sultan), and that the longer we leave him in peace, ihe more cnmnletely his self-esteem will recover itself. ^he f«ct that I , the Levies and a sloop have visited Kalba withert bringing the miscreant back has caused some surprised o-nseir in the Dubai and Shar.iah ba.zaars, and I think that mpre was expected of us by everyone* including S&amp;qR himself^ f^Fe could still dislodge him from Kalba without di ficulty if T e sent a force of Levies to arrive before a sloop by a few hours* so that the troops would get through* the Vadi al Qor before sus; icions were aroused^. The Sheikh of IPujairoh would probably be the most suitable person to put in as Ruler of Kalba. but there are other candidates, notably in the Shar.iah ruling family,^and I think that the expulsion of Sg.qr and Ali bin Amir ib the first necessity, so that the T, ishes of the people of Kalb . can make themselves heard. As an alternative to direct action we might unleash the Sheikh of Fujairah, but in that case we should have to await his time and convenience, and might or might not see a decisive result. - 'P.S.

I think that there are several reasons vhy, whatever our policy may have been in the past, we should not condone the usurpation of the rule of Kalba in this instance: n.J. Felly* Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, BAHRAIN. (a) In Has al Khaimah, there was in effect a revolution against an unsatisfactory ruler which resulted in his replacement by a more satisfactory one. In Kalba we have the opposite case - the murder of a satisfactory ruler by a family of whose violence and appetite for intrigue this is only the latest demonstration, and the return to a dominant position of Sultan oin ^alim, whom we removed from Kalba in a sloop in 1937 when he attempted to profit from the death of Shaikh Sa'id bin Hamad to make himself Ruler of Kalba. fb) In previous cases, where we have bowed to a u fait accompli', we have done so only after the usurper had given proper guarantees of future good behaviour, satisfactory observance of treaty undertakings etc. It is for consider ation whether any such guarantees in this case, even if tendered, could be seriously entertained. Could Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited be sounded as to their willingness to consider concessionary - relationship/...relationships with Sultan bin Salim*s family ? (c) I fear that we shall now see established in the Kalba area a refuge for lawless characters and dealers in slaves, arms etc, much nearer to us than the present centres in and beyond Buraimi. We may not be able to prevent this, but I think we would place ourselves in a difficult and foolish position vis-a-vis the other Shaikhs were we to enter into relations with Kalba which would condone it. (d) Again, I feel that whatever our past policy has been, u change in it has in fact taken place, whether explicit or implicit, and I think that the time has passed when we could accept murder as a suitable basis on which to establish a succession in a state with which we have treaty relationships. It rather makes nonsense of our claims that the states are under our protection. We would intervene to prevent the Ruler of Abu Dhabi, for instance, waging war on or trying to assassinate the Ruler of Dubai, and I think J we have a similar obligation to do some- * thing when the Ruler of Kalba is assassin ated and his Shaikhdom taken over by out side force. As I have said, we resisted a far less reprehensible step in 1937. of the other Trucial Coast Rulers, and the effect which this '’coup*', if it passes unchallenged, will have on general security and law/.... • • • •3 and law and order in the area. If it does nothing worse, it will encourage an increased reliance on personal arm aments and an increased expectation of violence at a time when, in view of the oil operations, we are endeavour ing to work for greater stability not only in succession matters, but in every-day life. To sum up, I consider that whether viewed from the moral stand-point or from that of expediency and our own political interests, that this is a far more serious matter, and involves a far bigger step backwards, than the Sha'am disputes, the Wekra affair, or any of the other occasions which I can call to mind when the Navy have been asked to intervene. I do not think that we are expected to sit quietly under this affront to cur interests and influence here, and I think that both will suffer, not only in Kalba, if we do so. 3 # ^ The problem of what J pCti our dls - approval should take is a difficult one, but I do not think that the availability of h.M. Ships or similar considerations should weigh in assessing whether or not we should voice it. It will produce a deplorable effect - on the tribes of the interior and the Saudis not less than on the other Trucial Rulers, - if we are not able to intervene effectively when necessary in the aflairs even f of the Trucial States themselves, and I think that every effort should be made to mount a combined operation to expel Sultan bin Salim and his sons from the Coast. If this cannot be done because of lack of resources, the natural strength of Sultan's position at Munia» and the other factors we discussed, I am convinced that we should pursue all the measures which are open to us with the greatest/4 f greatest vigour. We should withold recognition, all payments and arms, and if either Fu*jdirah or Sharjah show the slightest signs of wishing to intervene I think we should encourage them and back them. We should also do our best to get the other Rulers to disapprove and to take such steps to boycott Kalba as we can persuade them to. If Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited are worried about the future of their concession, could they be persuaded to pay the sums due into an account in which they could be held until a new Ruler of Kalba is recognized ? This would also have the advantage, if a new Ruler could be found and installed, of not starting him off with a completely empty treasury .^ 4. Since I began to write this, the Ruler of Sharjah has brought me a letter which he has received from Saqr bin Sultan bin Salim announcing that he has assumed the rule of Kalba, and asking for the former^ co-operation in view of their family relationship. Saqr asked what his attitude should be. I said that it was a matter for his own conscience, but that I hoped the Trucial Rulers could see their own interests sufficiently clearly not to acquiesce in something which, as far as I could see, could only have a bad effect on them all. Shaikh Sa 1 id of Dubai also sent Abdullah bin Loota, one of his personal attendants, in to Sharjah this morning to question Ali Bustani on the matter. Abdullah was not given any information, but Sa’id also is clearly worried and no . doubt thinking of the precarious situation which would arise in Dubai should succession by assassination become the rule. Are we or the Oil Company prepared to see one of the Shaikh Juma*s sons rule in Dubai ?■T\ CONFIDENTIAL, 0220/27/51 zzfbll3/£J (To British Agency, Sharjah, 10th July 1951. -N- -m- Further to my telegrams 103, 104 and 105 of yesterday., 2. Within a short time of my hearing [ the first report of the assassination of Shaikh Hamad bin Sa f id from Khalil Sami 1 i, Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of Sharjah called on me with a letter from Sultan bin Salim, and a covering letter from Shaikh Muhammed bin Saqr, of which I enclose translations» I was also given details, though not by eyewitnesses, of the cold-blooded shooting down of Hamad, Ali bin Hazim, his Secretary, and a young slave in his bed room in the middle of the morning on 29th - 30th Ramadhan by Saqr bin Sultan bin Salim, Khalid bin Sultan, his brother, Ali bin Amir (former Secretary 1 to the Shaikh of Fujairah and a Muscat subject) and I Ramis, a slave of Sultan bin Salim who was with him I when he shot his way out of the Agency. Saqr bin Sultan evinced some uneasiness, and hoped frequently that H.M.G. would take strong measures, going so far as to say that if that sort of thing was tolerated, no-one could feel himself safe. 3. I do not know what measures will eventually prove practicable, but I agree that they should be exemplary, and if we can lay our hands on Sultan bin Salim and his sons, I think we must ensure that they are removed from the Trucial Coa^st permanently. There will be difficulties about physical measures, as Sultan bin Salim controls the Wadi el Qor route to Kalba and it will be extremely difficult to dis lodge him by any ordinary expedition. A sloop could probably evict Saqr from Kalba, (although he is reported to be holding Hamad’s sisters prisoners in the fort, presumably in the hope that this will save him from bombardment) but unless we can open the road as well, we should not be much better off. If Sultan bin Salim really reprehends his sons' action as he seems to claim, and comes in to Sharjah, we may find Saqr more easy to handle, but I am not optimistic of thisIf,, as seems more likely, we are unable to lay hands- on any of them, I propose to take this opportunity to summon the first meeting of the Trucial Council, and by exploiting ..the situation for all it is worth, try to get the Rulers to act together for once, outlaw Sultan ►bin Salim, and put a price on their heads. I shall try to insist that none of them ever permits the two, or any of the other murderers, to take sanctuary in their ‘territoriesIf we do catch any of them, I should like your views on the expediency of having them tried by the Rulers in conclave.

'^he problem of the succession is serious, as Hamad has left no obvious successor, and the jealousies between the other Rulers, notably Sharjah, Has al Khaimah and Fujairah will almost certainly vitiate both common action against the murderers, and an agreed solution to the succession problem.^ Already bazaar rumours are that the assassination was arranged between Sultan bin Salim, Muhammad bin Saqr, and Muhammed al Sharqi of Fujairah, though it is difficult to see what common interest these three would have in Hamad's death. Certainly both Sultan bin Salim and his son Saqr were in Sharjah a few days before the murder, and rumours are that Saqr purchased arms andammunition here. Saqr is reported to be doing what he can to consolidate his •position in Kalba. His men occupied the fort as soon as Hamad had been killed, and he at once summoned the notables and had them sign a document purporting to express their wish that he should be their Ruler. Stories are also being circulated of discontent in Kalba at Hamad's rule and the severity of the taxes he imposed. Muhammed bin Saqr here is said to be playing the whole thing down as much as possible, deprecating any interference, and suggesting that Saqr has as much claim to rule in Kalba as Hamad had.Translation of letter dated the 5th Shawal , h Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, the former Ruler of Has al Khaimah, to Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr of Sharjah. After Compliments, I have received your letter about the ’Id el Futr’s congratulation and ask God to repeat it to all and Muslims for many years withwalfare and blessing. Perhaps you have heard about the incident which occured by Saqr against his cousin (Hamad bin Sa'id). When he went from Sharjah and arrived at el Wadi, I was about to depart, and when I returned to Huwailat, I was told that he had ta-en Askaris (guards) and went to Sharqi (Shaikh Muhammed bin Hamad of Fujairah) to release the prisoner. I was not aware until I received this grievous news which does not please God or his Prophet. I am very much sorry about this action at the end of the month of Ramadhan. Really it is the unfortune fate of this creature. The doer is the almighty God and I am not pleased for his (?Saqr's) activities in cutting off his relatives. What do you think about him ? I am innocent in this incident and had no part in it. I am sorry I am unable to write to Saqr as the car is about to leave.

Y h i Confidential. 0224/3/51 I enclose copies of letters from Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed to myself and Shaikhs Saqr and Humaid bin Saqr,and from Shaikh Humaid to Shaikh Saqr concerning the village of Dhaid. 2. You will see that Shaikh Khalid in his dotage is prepared to relinquish his rights in Dhaid for a cash consideration, but that he took the unfortunate step of disposing of his financial interest to Shaikh Hvmaid, the Ruler’s uncle, in a rather equivocally worded letter. Saqr then attempted to undo this damage by obtaining letters from Shaikhs hhalid and Humaid to the effect that the sovereignty of Dhaid remained with the Ruler of Sharjah, and that the transferred rights were only financial. Shaikh umaic has avoided giving this assurance in so many words, but the meaning of his letter seems clear enough. 3. I consider it unfortunate, and I have told Saqr so, that the alienation of the Dhaid zakat should thus have been perpetuated, and have asked him whether he cannot buy out his uncle Humaid, and himself undertake to pay the old man his fo. 1000/- a year and retain the right to levy zakat and all the othe. manifestations of sovereignty in Dhaid in his own ha nds, and he has said that he will try to do this. »• appeared from his understanding of the matter, also, that the agreement reached between Shaikh Khalid and Shaikh Humai was not for a yearly sum of Rs. 1000/- in perpetuity, cis stated in the latter’s letter to me, but for a total of Rs. 4000/-, presumably in four annual payments. ShaiKn Humaid is at present in India, where he has gone .or medical treatment, so the matter may take some time to unravel, but I shall inform you of the final solution, if one i^ reached, and hope that you approve, meanwhile, of the line I have so far taken. Shaikh Khalid’s son Saqr, now about Lfylar of age, is the only person likely to be adversely affected by the new arrangement, as I understand tba Shaikh Khalid's nephew Saqr bin Abdullah now srends al^ his time in Dibbah and takes little interest inShar„ah affairs. The only other danger I can think of is that Shariah's relations with the Beni &lt;i ab may be strained by this forward policy, but that, I think, is a risk we should be prepared to take. ^ , I have not yet replied to Shaikh and shall not do so until I hear from you.
