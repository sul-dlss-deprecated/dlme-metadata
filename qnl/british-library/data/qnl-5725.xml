Italian Proceedings on the African Coast of the Red Sea. A Memorandum, dated the 14th May 1880, embodied the correspondence up to that time on the subject of the Italian occupation of Assab Bay, on the eastern coast of the Red Sea. The present paper, under a more comprehensive title, continues the story down to the present date. Although the different branches of the subject are a good deal intermixed, it will be most convenient to treat it under separate heads, as follows :—(l) the actual course of events at Assab and in the neighbour hood since May 1880; (2) correspondence which has passed, in the same period, between the British, Italian, and Egyptian Governments, and between this Office and the Foreign Office; and (3) a question lately raised in connection with a pro posed disembarkation of Egyptian troops at Raheita. * Page 15. t From Foreign Office, 1st June 1880 ; No. 398. f From War No. 473.

Course of Events at Assab and in the Neighbourhood. May 1880 to September 1881.—On this head not very much is to be said. The situation in the month of March 1880 will be found described in Captain Hunter’s report, quoted in the former Memorandum.* Upon the occasion of his visit, he was accompanied by Captain Berners, of Her Majesty’s ship “ Philomel,” whose separate reportf to the Admiralty led their Lord- ships to point out to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs “the importance which must be “ attached, from a naval point of view, to the “ establishment of a coaling station, which may “ apparently be readily converted into a naval “ station, in the Red Sea.”J On the 28th June 1880, the “ Philomel ” again visited Assab. Captain Berners found the settle ment greatly improved, several houses and work shops having been built, and the pier much enlarged. There were, however, no settlers, with the exception of Signor Sapeto, and the work was all carried on by Arabs, assisted by the crews of two Italian cruizers. Trade was almost nil, pearl shells being the principal article, and there seemed no likelihood of any immediate increase. § According to a native report received at Aden, in the middle of July 1880, large further purchases of territory by the Italians were either completed or in progress. Booby Hill (1), Ras Sintaur (2), and Jebel Siyan (3), were bought but not yet paid for. For Sanaboor Island (4), 3,000 dollars had been paid. Ras Beilul (5) w r as purchased for 4,000 6005. I. 20 63. A1 2 dollars, still unpaid. The Italians were also endea vouring to purchase Marghiblah, in the interior (6), but the local Sultan was said to be afraid to sell it because of the English Government.* The interpreter of the Aden Residency at this time visited the Sheikh of Beilul, whose story was that an Italian steamer had lately been there three times, and desired to have an interview with him, but that he, being afraid, had left the place; that the Italians wanted some portion of his land, but that he had refused to give an answer until he got advice from the English Government, from whom he was expecting something; that he and his people were in a bad way, but that other Sultans in the vicinity were doing well, as they had sold portions of their land to the Italian Government, and were living upon the purchase money.f At the beginning of September 1880, the Resi dent at Aden received a letter from one Mahomed Yareez, nephew and heir to Sultan Burhan of Raheita (1) and Marghiblah, offering to sell to the British Government his share of the family posses sions, which he described as extending “ from the “ Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to Dameirah (2), and “ from thence to Syan and the forests.” The Resident replied that, so far as Government was aware, the territory he mentioned w r as a part of the Egyptian African possessions and under their suzerainty or jurisdiction, but that the British Go vernment wmuld be made acquainted with his representation.} On the 20th September, the boats of Her Ma jesty’s ship “ Seagull ” found the Italian corvette “ Ettore Eieramosca ” anchored off Ras Dameirah. The officer in charge of the boats was informed, through the Somali interpreters, that the Chief of Raheita w r as going to sell to the Italians a small island adjacent, but that the owner of it desired its purchase by the British Government^ On the 21st January 1881, Ali Pasha Riza, Egyptian Governor of the Red Sea Coast, made a report to his Government on a visit he had lately paid to Assab. || He found there the Italian cor vette “ Eieramosca.” The settlement consisted then of five stone buildings and ten barracks, occupying a space of ground 7,000 metres in extent, beyond which v 7 as the desert. There are only two roads from Assab to other points ; both follow the coast— one northwards to Beilul, Eid, and Massow r ah;— the other, southwards, to Raheita, where it strikes inland. No direct road leads into the interior. There is little or no trade. The inhabitants of the country have a violent hatred against all who are not Mussulmans, and also against the Sheikh Abd- Allah Chehem, Chief of the Danakil tribe, credited with being the cause of the arrival of the Italians, and of the people being consequently deprived of the products (dates) on which they used to subsist. Ali Pasha Riza found that, in one w T ay or another, the Italians had acquired the whole coast (6.) A short distance from the Italian settlement. * India ; Secret, No. 203, dated 7th Sep tember 1880. f As above. (1.) South of Assab Bay. (2.)

J In fi f . th ® Ba y of Assab ^om Has Sintaur, in the south to Has Lomar, in the north,* and all the islands in the hay; also, the coast from the latter pomt to Has Warma (described as the southern limit of Beilul), including the island of Labour (Sanaboor), in addition to a piece of territory, north olBeiiul, known as “Bahr Assoul ” and “ Lita The deeds of sale, having been duly legalized by the Italian Government, had been sent back to Assah, and were actually on board the “ Fieramosca.” On this head the Pasha remarked, “ Je pense que si “ £ orapeau Egyptien ne se trouvait pas hisse a ‘ Beilul, on aurait pris arbitrairement possession de cette place qui se trouve en ce moment situe entre “ les deux endroits vendus.” The Sheikh Abd’Allah Chehem had placed him self under the protection of Italy, and Sheikh Burhan had done the same, notwithstanding that he was in enjoyment of a pension from the Egyptian Government, and had several times received presents in the name of the Khedive. Sheikh Burhan refused to visit the Pasha when summoned (as was believed, as the instance of Signor Sapeto, the representative of the Hubattino Company), and was claimed by the Captain of the “ Eieramosca ” as an Italian protege. Ali Pasha Hiza contested this assertion, and formally protested against the arbitrary seizure of territory belonging to the Egyptian Government, and the assumption of a protectorate over its subjects. On the 4th January 1881, it was reported from Home that Signor Bianchi, a Government official, was about to be sent to Assab Bay by the Italian Government to undertake the civil administration of the settlement, and that he would be assisted by Signor Giulietta, who had previously explored the country.! According to information given by the Italian consul at Aden to the Hesident there, the appoint ment was consequent on the return to Italy of Signor Sapeto, owing to ill health, and the position to be held by Mons. Bianchi was that of Civil Commissioner, or, as the Cousul added, “ a sort of “ Governor.’’J In reporting this, the Hesident observed: “ The fact of the Italian Government “ sending a Civil Commissioner to act as Consul, or “ Governor, at Assab, strengthens the opinion held “ by this Hesidency and expressed on several occa- “ sions, that the occupation of Assab has been from “ the very commencement an undertaking on the “ part of the Italian Government, and that the “ name of the Rubattino Company was put forward “ only as a blind to cover their own designs.” Subsequently Captain Frigerio informed the Hesident that Signor Bianchi had been given Consul General’s powers over both theAfrican and Arabian littorals of the Red Sea, and that he was only awaiting the receipt of his exequatur from Italy; that Signor Giulietti, who had been appointed Secretary to Signor Bianchi, would start shortly for the interior of Abyssinia by a road that was4 supposed to exist from Assab across the mountains, but as to which the Captain himself had no faith. He added that, from the fact of Signor Bianchi being a Government servant, from his having been vested with powers of a Consul General in the Red Sea, and from his being allowed a Secretary, he believed that Assab had become the property of the Italian Government.* At the end of April, the Sheikh of Beilul re ported to the Governor of Massowah the arrival there ol certain Italians who had come overland from Assab, and by their violent proceedings were greatly alarming the inhabitants. When questioned as to why they had established themselves in territory belonging to Egypt, they replied that the country irom Assab to Assoul belonged to them, and that they could act in it as they pleased. The bearer of this report added that an Italian ship had landed at Beilul a second party, making the number present fifty persons. The Governor of Massowah referred to the Egyptian Government for instruc tions as to the measures he should take to reassure the people, f The Egyptian Foreign Minister at once addressed the Italian Agent, to the effect that the proceedings reported were calculated to trouble the peace of the country ; that such acts, in places occupied for the most part by a nomad population, easily excited, might have grave consequences; and that the Egyptian Government would be compelled to take steps to assert its authority and protect its subjects. M. de Martino simply replied that he would refer the matter to his Government, and that, meanwhile, he relied upon the measures of the Egyptian Government being moderate and prudent. A similar account of the Italian proceedings was subsequently given by Sheikh Arkitu, described as “ Chief of Beilul and Ghubhi,” to Captain Hulton of Her Majesty’s ship “Dragon.” The Sheikh stated that he complained to one of the Italian authorities—probably Signor Bianchi—of the expe dition frightening the people in the villages, running after the women, &amp;c., and also warned him that his countrymen had better not go up country, as the tribes there were very wild and there was no Government.]; The prognostications of the Egyptian Foreign Minister and the warning of the local Sheikh were destined to be speedily justified. In the middle of June, news was received of the massacre of an Italian exploring party near Beilul. The party was composed of Signor Giulietta, ten seamen of the “Ettore Fieramosca,” under Sub-Lieutenant Biglieri, two Italian workmen, and two native servants, and was in search of a new route to the highlands of Abyssinia. § The disaster occurred on the 25th May, at a place called Dattatu, near the Abyssinian frontier, twelve days from the coast, and every member of the expedition perished. The Italian Agent in Egypt was at once in structed to call upon the Egyptian Government to * From Aden ; No. 3, dated 10th February 1881. t From Foreign Office, 17th June 1881 ; No. 419. f Commander Hulton’s Report, 5th July 1881.

' 6 institute a rigorous inquiry into the facts, at which the Italian Government desired the presence of the “ Ettore Eieramosca.”* In conversation with Mr. Cookson, the Offici ating British Agent and Consul General, M. de Martino confessed that the Italians had done wrong in entering on such an enterprise without the authorization and protection of the Egyptian Local Government, in whose territory he fully admitted Beilul and the place of the massacre were situated. He did not seek to hold the Egyptian Government responsible for what might have happened in a district where their authority was necessarily only nominal; nor did he expect much practical result from the inquiry which, however, was necessary to satisfy public opinion in Italy.! On the 13th June, the Italian Ambassador in London informed Lord Granville of what had happened. His Excellency stated that an Italian despatch boat had been sent to superintend the inquiry which was to be held on the spot, and that his Government would be glad if an English vessel could also be present. They were anxious, he said, to show that they had no thoughts of occupying the place, and the Italian vessel would be there simply for the purpose of watching the inquiry which would be conducted by the Egyptian autho- rities.J There appearing no objection to compliance with the Italian request, Her Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah was directed to proceed to Beilul on board a ship of war; but, it being found that he could not reach the spot in time. Her Majesty’s ship “ Dragon ” was ordered on the duty. The instruc tions to Commander Hulton were, to be present at the inquiry, but to take no part in it himself, and to avoid recognizing any sovereignty over the coast but that of the Sultan, and, under him of the Khedive. § The Egyptian Government appointed Ibrahim Bushdi Pasha and the Governor of Massowah to conduct the investigation, but demurred to the presence either of an Italian or a British ship. This point, however, was ultimately conceded, it being clearly understood that neither the Italian nor British Commander would be entitled to in terfere with the course of the inquiry, which would be entirely in the hands of the Egyptian Com missioner. || The investigation commenced at Beilul, about the middle, of July. The precise result is not yet known. According to Signor Bianchi, writing on the 20th June from Assab,^] there was no doubt that the whole country round Beilul was concerned in the massacre, the plan for its execution having been discussed there, and assented to by the Chiefs; those who had taken part in it were at that date beginning to return to Beilul, where they showed themselves with impunity, carrying on their arms the signs of victory, after the fashion of the 6005. bDanakils, or actually wearing the spoils of the victims.* On the other hand, one Mahomond, second Chief at Beilul, in conversation with Captain Hulton on the 22nd June, disowned any knowledge of the affair, or that any of his people had had anything to do with it, in very firm language; the perpe trators were, he said, others up country in a part where his people were afraid to go, and where they themselves had had 30 men killed last year. But he seemed very nervous and uneasy in his manner.t Writing from off Beilul on the 26th July, Captain Hulton expressed his opinion that there was little probability of the inquiry ending in securing any of the culpable ones, or even finding out with certainty who they were, as the witnesses were almost all denying any knowledge of the affair, and many of them were contradicting themselves, showing that the evidence was valueless, and leaving the inference also that they had been told what to say.} In accordance with this anticipation, the Egyptian Commissioners telegraphed to their Government, on the 7th August, that the inquiry was on the point of being terminated ; that no proof had been esta blished against the inhabitants of Beilul; and that the massacre seemed to have been committed by un - subdued tribes in the interior at 13 days distance from the coast. § This information was communicated by Lord Granville through the British Charge d’Affaires at Borne to the Italian Government, who however had received similar intelligence from their own Agent. In conversation with Mr. Macdonell,|| Signor Malvano said that the Government were not only disappointed, but seriously annoyed, with the failure of the inquiry. It was beyond doubt, he added, that several individuals connected with the massacre were seen at Beilul, and that, though the Italian Government did not desire the punish ment of innocent persons, it was, he thought, the bounden duty of the Egyptian Government to make an example of any one directly or indirectly con nected with the crime. Eurther details must, of course, be awaited, but the results reported were sufficient to prove that the Egyptian Government had not acted with the good faith which the Italian Government had a right to expect. Signor Malvano, however, requested Mr. Mac- donell to assure Lord Granville that, notwith standing this painful result, the Italian Government were determined to act with the utmost moderation, and to do all in their power to avoid raisin 0, a question,—though they expected to be severely attacked and criticized for the insufficiency of their action. In connection with his employment at Beilul, Captain Hulton took the opportunity of visiting Assab, and his report, dated the 16th Jnlv, con- * * * See post, p. 30. f Somali Coast, Sect. 3.

At “ present the only Italians there are the Com- et missaire, a civil engineer, and two or three work- “ men, and, since the massacre, a guard, consisting “ of one Sub-Lieutenant and sixteen seamen be- “ longing to the men-of-war have been present. “ There is a bakery establishment which is enough “ to cook for the men-of-war when in port, and a “ small distilling apparatus, the well water being “ slightly brackish. “ There are not more than six or eight houses “ altogether, but I have overseen a plan for the “ future, in which it is marked out in streets, and “ a Lubattino factory, &amp;c. “ They are gradually commencing to establish “ trade connections by samhoks (small dhows) with “ Hodeida, Mocha, and Massowah, getting cattle “ and other things from those places, and doubt- “ less have agents at these ports. I think it “ probable we may before long see some of these “ native craft flying Italian colours. “ The anchorage off Assab is very good, and “ there is a most marked difference between the “ freshness of the place and the oppressiveness of “ Beilul.” Lord Granville, 181. je, 27th August; This portion of the subject may be closed by a quotation from a report (1st June 1881) by Consul Zobrab, lately at Jeddah, on the necessity of British Consular establishments in the Bed Sea. He, it will be seen, shares the general scepticism as to the object of the Italian settlement being com mercial, as has been professed. He observes:— “ By taking possession of Assab Bay, Italy has “ published her purpose. It is true that the spot “ taken is a miserable place, but it is a foothold on “ the African continent, and her flag floats there as “ possessor; how far she will extend her possession “ inland time alone will show. It cannot be “ supposed that, merely to keep possession of a “ wretched strip of sand, of no commercial value “ whatever, she would incur the expense of main- “ tainin' an establishment there, with two war “ vessels; she must, therefore, have a purpose, of “ which Assab Bay is the mere starting point, and “ I am of opinion this purpose will be made “ manifest when her hold on Assab has been con- “ solidated/’ f From Foreign Office, 26th May 1880; No. 382. Correspondence between the British, Italian, and Egyptian Governments, and BETWEEN THE INDIA OFFICE AND THE FOREIGN Office May 1880 to September 1881.—In the month of May 1880, General Menabrea commu nicated to Lord Granvillef a Memorandum on the Assab Bay question, based on the “M&amp;noire”9 * Memorandum, 14th May 1880, pp. 19 and 20 . t Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople reported the issue of this, in a Despatch, No. 24, dated 8th June 1880.

He, writing on the 24th April 1880, observed with regard to it:—^ “ The wording of my appointment to Assab Bay “ leads me to believe that Her Majesty’s Govem- “ ment suppose that Egyptian authorities are “ resident there. Such, however, not being the “ case, could the presence, temporary or otherwise, “ of a locally unrecognized British Consul oppose “ any barrier to the intentions of Italy ? I ap- “ prebend not; for, with the Italians to support “ him, Sultan B urban would turn a deaf ear to “ advice, protests, or threats, and the Consul would “ find himself nothing more nor less than a “ nonentity, houseless, unheeded, uncared for. but “ suspected and disliked. Hid his presence produce “ no further baneful results the harm would not be “ great and might be overcome, but I apprehend “ the issue would be much more serious. Armed “ with the credentials of an unacknowledged and “ hated authority, he would be regarded as charged “ to compel submission to that authority, and that “ England was determined to place the people “ under the hated yoke; the result would probably “ be the creation of an intensely hostile feeling “ towards England, which would culminate, I fear, “ in raising at an inopportune moment grave “ political questions between England, Italy, and “ Egypt. These difficulties and dangers can, I “ venture to suggest, only be obviated by the “ Khedive sending a force to Assab Bay and “ establishing his supremacy there. Till this is “ done, nothing, I believe, can result from the “ presence of a British Consul but intrigue and “ mischief; for, as the question now stands, it “ would be the Consul who would have to show, “ in a country where there is not a shadow of “ Egyptian authority, that the Khedive is master.” § From Foreign Office, 26th May 1880; No. 382. || From Foreign Office, 27th August 1881 ; No. 622. General Menabrea’s Note was not at once replied to, Lord Granville, who had assumed office only a few weeks before, desiring to inform himself more fully of the facts of the case and their different bearings. § Concurrently there was correspondence on the subject between the Italian and Egyptian Govern ments. On the 25th April 1880, || Moustapha Eehmy Pasha, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, ad dressed a note to M. de Martino, the Italian Agent in Egypt, referring to what had passed in 1870 in respect to the Rubattino purchase of land at Assab, 6005. C10 calling attention to reports which had been re ceived of recent proceedings there, which were of a nature to affect the sovereign prerogatives of the Egyptian Government, which were clearly esta blished by formal firmans, and requesting explana tions. The Note added that if the Rubattino Com- pany desired to establish a commercial station or coal depot at Assab, nothing would have been easier than to apply to the Khedive’s Government, which was always ready to promote the development of commerce and navigation. This communication drew a Despatch from M. Cairoli to M. de Martino (17th May 1880), of identical tenour with that to Sir A. Paget of 19th April 1880.* The same historical “ Memoire ” * Memorandum, 14th May 1880, p. 31. was appended to it, and the same conclusions were drawn from the same references to the Abyssinian Blue Book, viz., that sovereignty over the part of the coast in question had never been exercised by the Porte or Egypt, but had continued vested in the local Sultans', and, so far as Assab was con cerned, had passed, first, to the Rubattino Com pany with the territory purchased, and so to the Italian Government. The old protestations of the purely commercial objects of the establishment were renewed t t From Foreign Office, 22nd June 1880 No. 463. A copy of Signor Cairoli’s Despatch and its annexures was given to the Egyptian Government, and was communicated by it to Mr. Malet, the British Agent and Consul General, who, writing to Lord Granville (1st June 1880, No. 222), observed:— “ The present Despatch from Signor Cairoli “ appears to have for its general object to prolong “ the discussion as to the rights of Egypt over the “ territory indefinitely, to pursue the designs wdrich “ led to the occupation, and to prevent the « Egyptians from taking any active measures of “ interference. Nor is there, I fear, much chance “ of this policy being frustrated. The Egyptians “ are weak and vacillating in opposing a great “ Power, and they are not likely to take measures “ which would lead them into difficulties with “ Italy unless they have a positive assurance that, &lt;f if necessary, they will receive more than our “ moral support.” In a letter from the Eoreign Office, dated the 18th June 1880,J Lord Hartington’s opinion was t Home; No. 454. asked as to the answer which should be returned to General Menebrea’s Note of May, attention being called to the fact that “notwithstanding the re- •“ peated assurances and protestations made to Sir “ A.

Mallet, dated the 27th October 1880, as follows :—* “ Bord Hartington’s opinion, it would be of “ doubtful policy to engage in a controversial dis- “ cussion with the Italian Government of the nature “ which appears to be invited by General Menabrea’s “ Memorandum and Signor Cairoli’s Note to Sir “ A. Paget of the 19th April, with the appended “ pro memorid. “ Those documents are entirely based upon ex- “ tracts from the Abyssinian Blue Book of 1868, “ which are quoted in support of the contention “ that, upon various occasions between the years “ 1846 and 1862, the British Government or its “ Agents expressed opinions adverse to the title of “ the Porte to sovereignty over certain districts “ along the African coast of the Red Sea. “ How far the extracts in question, if read in “ connection with their context, support the “ position taken up by the Italian Government, “ may perhaps be open to argument. An examina- “ tion of the Blue Book will show r that passages “ might be quoted tending to prove that, whatever “ abstract views may have been expressed by “ British authorities, Turkish or Egyptian occupa- “ tion of the principal points along the coast, as “ far south as Zeyla, had by 1862 become an “ accomplished fact, so much so that the Resident “ at Aden (Sir W. Coghlan), writing to the Govern- 41 ment of Bombay on the 23rd May 1862, described “ the Hankali coast—which is now immediately in “ question—as ‘ an integral portion of the Turkish “ ‘ dominions,’ the revenues of its chief ports being “ annually farmed out by the Pasha of Yemen. Be “ that as it may, it is scarcely open to question that, “ between 1862 and 1870, the Egyptian authority “ along the coast had become generally established, “ although there may have been isolated points, “ such as Assab Bay, where it was not effectively “ asserted, and where the local Sheikhs might pro- “ fess independence when it seemed to be their “ interest so to do. “ Lord Hartington would, therefore, suggest that, “ without entering into a discussion of the validity “ of the argnments adduced by General Menabrea “ and Signor Cairoli, the reply to the Italian “ Ambassador should substantially adhere to the “ view put forward in the Marquis of Salisbury’s “ Despatch to Sir A. Paget, No. 51, of the 7th “ February last.f “ An additional reason for wording the reply to “ the Italian Ambassador in very general terms ap- “ pears to Lord Hartington to be furnished by the “ fact that the Governments primarily concerned12 “ are those of Turkey and Egypt, with whom it ' should rest to controvert in detail the arguments “ by which Italian aggression oil territory claimed “ as Egyptian is attempted to he justified. “ Under existing cii*cumstances, however, Lord “ Hartington sees no objection to an intimation « being conveyed to the Italian Government, should « Lord Granville deem this step necessary, to the “ effect that, whilst Her Majesty’s Government “ adhere to the opinion above referred to and “ already communicated to the Ministers of the “ King, they are content to waive further dis- “ cussion of the question, as being now of little “ practical importance, in view of the categorical ' and peremptory declaration of Signor Cairoli, in “ his Note to Sir A. Paget of the 19th April last, “ that no Italian Government establishment of a “ military character will ever he formed at Assab, “and that at no time will either troops or fortifi- “ cations be maintained, either on the mainland or “ on the islands in the Bay.” A reply to General Menabrea, in the sense of Lord Hartington’s views, was drafted in the Foreign Office, and sent here for concurrence on the 14th January 1881.* Attention was, at the same time, drawn to the report of a project for the formation of an Italian maritime and commercial port at Assab, details of which appeared in an Italian newspaper (“ L’Economiste ”), published apparently in Egypt, and also to a telegram from Her Majesty’s Agent and Consul General in that country, stating that he had been informed confidentially that the Italian Government had made a treaty with the Chief of the district in the neighbourhood of Assab, placing his territory under the suzerainty of Italy, and containing an article for the suppression of the slave trade. Lord Hartington’s opinion was asked whether any notice should be taken of this matter. In reply, it was recommended from this Oflicef that the note to General Menabrea, the tenour of which was in the sense of Lord Salisbury’s De spatch to Sir A. Paget of the 7th February 1880, should simply record the adherence of Her Majesty’s Government to the conclusions expressed in that Despatch, without repeating the arguments by which they were supported; that reference to the question of the Somali Coast outside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb should be avoided; and that no notice should be taken of the report received from Mr. Malet, hut that the initiative in connection therewith should be left to the Egyptian Govern ment, or that of the Sultan. Lord Granville concurred in this view, and the reply to General Menabrea, which was addressed to M. de Bessmann, the Italian Charge d’Affaires, under date the 26th January 1881, was in the fol lowing terms :— X “ I have given my most attentive consideration, “ in communication with Her Majesty’s Secretary “ of State for India, to the memorandum which “ His Excellency General Menabrea did me the * Home ; No. 29. t To Foreign Office, 20th January 1881 No. 29.

Paget of the 19th April last, that “ no Italian Government establishment of a military “ character will ever be formed at Assab, and that “ at no time will either troops or fortifications be “ maintained either on the mainland or on the “ islands in the bay.” The report, which had reached the British Agent in Egypt, as to the conclusion of a treaty between the Italian Government and a Chief in the neigh bourhood of Assab, w r as very shortly confirmed. Sir A. Paget, British Ambassador at Borne, took an opportunity of inquiring of Count Maffei as to its truth, which was at once admitted.* The Count was not quite clear as to whether the territory of the Chief was placed by the treaty under the suzerainty of Italy, but his remarks left no doubt on Sir A. Paget’s mind that it was so, The treaty, Count Maffei said, contained an article for the suppression of the slave trade, which had been inserted, not only in order to give effect to the feelings entertained by the Italian Government in regard to that traffic, but also because of the interest known to be taken by England in the question. A request by Sir A. Paget for a copy of the treaty was evaded. 6005. D *7a 14 The Chief in question was no doubt Sultan Bur- han, of Raheita, who, General Menabrea informed Lord Granville at an interview early in Marcdi 1881, had offered to become a tributary of the Italian Government. The Ambassador added, that the Italian Government had declined the offer, hut had promised to give protection to the Sultan in case of his being attacked.* The Foreign Office having asked whether Lord Hartington would wish any observation to be made to the Italian Government on the subject, were informed :f “ Without being favoured with some “ indication of the views of Her Majesty’s Secretary “ of State for Foreign Affairs on the general ques- “ tion which is involved, and in the absence of any “ information as to the light in which the proceed- “ ings of the Italian Government are regarded by “ the Khedive, whose rights are infringed, Lord “ Hartington feels it difficult to express any decided “ opinion as to the course which should he taken in “ the matter. “ It appears, however, to His Lordship to he “ obvious that if Count Menabrea’s communication “ be passed over in silence, the result would be “ gravely to compromise the position taken up in “ Earl Granville’s Note to M. dc Ressmann, of the “ 26th January last, in which it was stated, as the “ deliberate conclusion of Her Majesty’s Govern- “ ment, that to the Forte directly, and to the “ Khedive, under the Forte’s suzerainty, the territory “ of Assab must belong.” At this time a report appeared in the public press that a Royal Italian Commissioner had taken pos session of Assab in the name of the Italian Govern ment. This was denied by General Menabrea, who, on the 21st March, informed Lord Granville that the Commissioner had refused to do the very thing alleged, and that his sole duty was to maintain order amongst those who had established themselves at Assab.} A few days previously, General Menabrea had communicated to Lord Granville an extract of the instructions which had been furnished to Signor Bianchi, the lately appointed Italian Commissioner^ They were as follows :— “ Nous tenons avant tout a declarer que nous “ n’avons pas la moindre intention de fonder a “ Assab quoi que ce soit que puisse ressembler a un “ etablissement militaire ou h un etablissement “ destine a 1’usage de la marine militaire. II nous tient d autant plus a coeur de ne laisser sur^ir aucune doute a cet egard que nous avons d6ja fait “ au Gouvernement Britannique des declarations “ formelles et explicites dans ce sens.

The Italian Government offered to renew, in any form that might be desired, its previous declarations that the Assab establishment should never assume a military character, and expressed a hope that, in return, the British Government and its officials would do nothing which might impede the success of the settlement. From what the Ambassador said, it appeared that, in view of discussions impending in the Italian Chamber, his Government hoped to be enabled to declare that not only did the establish ment in question meet with no opposition from Her Majesty’s Government, but that it would have their moral support. This application having also been referred to this Office for Lord Hartington’s opinion, a reply was sent (24th March 1881),f to the effect that the matter appeared to be primarily for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; but that, in His Lordship’s judgment, such an assurance as was desired by General Menabrea, if given, could scarcely fail to be embarrassing to the Egyptian Government, while it would be inconsistent with previous declarations of that of Her Majesty. Accordingly, when pressed by General Menabrea munication to the Italian Government note had been taken of their assurances and of the categorical and peremptory declaration of Signor Cairoli, in his Note of the 19th April 1880, that no Italian Govern ment establishment of a military character would ever be formed at Assab, and that at no time would either troops or fortifications be maintained, either on the mainland or on the islands in the bay. It was, however, a very different thing to give such an assurance as was now requested. It would put the Egyptian Government in a false position, and would be contrary to the language Her Majesty’s Government had throughout held. “ Assab.” * From Foreign Office, 19th March 1881; No. 208.

Paget (No. 252) re ported an important conversation he had had with Baron Blanc on the subject.* The Baron said that it was perhaps not right to criticise the acts of a former administration, but at the same time it was impossible to deny that they had left to their successors two legacies of a very unenviable character ; he alluded to the question of Tunis and to the establishment at Assab Bay. lie would not now stop to inquire into the manner in which the difficulties connected with those two questions might have been avoided. The present Ministry for Poreign Affairs had to deal with the situation as they found it. With regard to Tunis, it was too late now, he said, to remedy what had been done, but it was not too late to take measures for preventing any mis understanding with England with reference to Assab Bay. There was no concealing the fact, he continued, that the position of Italy in regard to that question was not correct, and he appealed to Sir A. Paget to endeavour to induce Her Majesty’s Government to assist the Italian Government in regulating it (“ afin de la r^gulariser ”). An instruction had been pre pared for General Menabrea, he said, to lay the case before Lord Granville, and he believed it was the intention of M. Mancini to speak to Sir A. Paget upon it. Eor his own part, he did not hesitate to say that, rather than leave the question in its present state, and run the risk of a further mis understanding with England upon it, he would infinitely prefer to wind up the whole affair (“ liquider toute I’affaire ”), and to withdraw alto gether from Assab. To do this, however, would, he said, produce a very bad impression upon the country ; it would be felt as another humiliation experienced at the hands of England, after the recent one which had been inflicted upon Italy by Erance. It was in the power, however, of the English Government to obviate the difficulty, by recognizing in some way or other the position which Italy had taken up ; and in the course of his observations he threw out the idea of the possibility of an English Consul or Vice Consul being ap pointed to Assab. The Italian Government, he said, would be ready to agree to any conditions which Her Majesty’s Government might consider necessary as a security against the Italian colony ever becoming a source of menace to the com munications with India, or an embarrassment in any way to English interests. In reply, after referring briefly to his various conversations with M. Cairoli and Count Maffei on the subject of Assab, and to the formal declaration in writing, which in April of last year he had received, that no establishment of a military character would ever be formed by the Italian Government at Assab, of which due note had been taken by Her Majesty’s Government, Sir A. Paget * From Foreign Office, 30th June 1881 j No. 453.reminded Baron Blanc of the recent correspondence on the Italian request for moral support, and ex pressed doubts as to the result of reopening a ques tion upon which an answer had been so lately returned; adding that as regarded the appointment of a Consul or Vice Consul to reside at Assab, if it was intended that he should receive his exequatur from the Italian Government, it would be asking Her Majesty’s Government to place themselves in contradiction with their principles with respect to the question of sovereignty over that district,— principles which had only last year received con firmation by the jurisdiction of the British Consul at Jeddah having been extended to Assab under the exequatur of the Porte. At this point of the conversation Baron Blanc sent for M. Malvano, the head of the Political Department, who, in reply to Sir A. Paget’s last observation respecting the sovereignty, remarked that Her Majesty’s Government had not always been of the same opinion.* M. Malvano then, proceeded to state that, even without the appointment of a Consular officer, the object the Italian Government had in view might be attained by a diplomatic instrument between the two Governments, which, by its con ditions, would serve at the same time as a gua rantee against the establishment at Assab ever being used in a manner disadvantageous to British interests; for instance, it might, if desired, contain a clause forbidding the importation of arms or munitions of any kind ; another, with reference to the suppression of slavery; a third, that communi cation should be established between the Italian authorities at Assab and the Governor of Aden in regard to matters of commerce. “In short,” said Baron Blanc, who here interrupted M. Malvano, “ in addition to the declaration already given, by “ which we are bound never to create an establish- “ ment having a military character, and which we “ are now ready to confirm in even a more formal “ shape, we are ready to take every engagement “ and enter into every condition which may be “ desired by England for the security of her “ interests.” Sir A. Paget replied that it was of course im possible for him, without instructions, to pronounce any opinion upon such a proposal, but he promised to report to Lord Granville, as accurately as he could, the observations which had been made by Baron Blanc. In so doing, Sir A. Paget observed : — “ I may be permitted to add that the question of “ Assab is one upon which there is a very strong “ feeling throughout the country. Rightly or “ wrongly, it is thought that that possession will “ eventually become a centre of great commercial “ enterprise, and that it will be the destiny of Italy, “ while developing her trade, to spread the benefits “ of civilization amongst the populations in the “ interior. 6005. E18 “ It is certain, therefore, that anything which “ can be done by Her Majesty’s Government to “ meet the views of the Italian Government on the ' present occasion will be highly appreciated, not “ only by the Government, hut by the commercial, &lt;e scientific, and general public.” On the 18th June, Signor Mancini, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, in answer to a question respecting the reported intention of France to acquire a port on the east coast of Africa, ex plained that the rumour probably had reference to the French possession of Obokh, which was out side the Fed Sea, and in no way menaced the esta blishment at Assah, in regard to which France had never shown jealousy, but, on the contrary, had manifested sympathy.* The further overtures, foreshadowed by Baron Blanc in his conversation with Sir A. Paget, were very soon received. On the 7th July,f the Foreign Office forwarded to this Office two memoranda communicated to Lord Granville by the Italian Ambassador on the 29th June. The first of these papers, after formally reserving, on both sides, all question with respect to rights of sovereignty at Assab, and renewing previous declarations as to the exclusively commercial cha racter of the establishment there, suggested the desirability of establishing a modus vivendi between the Resident at Aden and the Italian official, de scribed as the “ Royal Italian Commissioner ” at Assab, and proposed that, with this object, a draft of arrangement should be prepared by Her Majesty’s Government, — 1. To authorize the officials above mentioned to correspond directly on all matters of local interest. 2. To authorize the Resident at Aden to accredit a British Agent to the Italian official. 3. To authorize the two officials to co-operate for the suppression of the slave trade; for the carrying out of commercial treaties or regulations ; and in all matters of general and humanitarian interest. The second memorandum stated that, with a view of suppressing the traffic in slaves, which the Italian Government learned from Assab was car ried on in that neighbourhood, and particularly at Beilul, they had instructed M. Bianchi, who in this second paper was described as “ Italian Civil “ Commissioner” at Assab, to put a stop to this traffic within the limits of his powers, and had authorized him to place himself in correspondence with the Resident at Aden, if necessary, in order to keep that officer informed on the subject. The memo randum further stated that it was intended to despatch an Italian ship to Assab to watch the vessels carrying on the slave trade. In requesting Lord Hartington’s views on the proposals made by the Italian Government, it was * Sir A. Paget to Lord Granville ; No. 256 dated 19tb June 1881. t Home ; No. 478.observed that Lopd Granville was not aware of the existence of any treaty between Italy and E~ypt, or between Italy and Turkey, giving the first-named £ower authority to deal with the slave trade in the lied Sea; that the treaty reported by Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome to have been concluded by Italy with one of the local Chiefs in the neigh bourhood of Assab was stated by Count Maffef to contain an article for the suppression of the slave trade; but that no copy of this treaty was in the possession of the Foreign Office. Mith regard to accrediting an Agent to the Italian official, Lord Hartington was reminded that Her Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah was also Consul for Assab Bay, under the Berat of the Sultan of Turkey. Lord Hartington’s views were expressed in a letter from Lord Enfield, dated the 26th July,* which, after recapitulating the language which had been used by Her Majesty’s Government in past correspondence with the Italian, Egyptian, and Turkish Governments, continued :— ^ Such being the case, Lord Hartington can come “ to no other conclusion than that the present pro- &lt;c posal of the Italian Government is, in effect, only “ another form of seeking that official recognition of their position at Assab which Her Majesty’s “ Government have consistently refused to accord, “ and that, if the present proposal be agreed to, “ without at any rate the cordial assent of the “ Turkish and Egyptian Governments, such agree- “ me at would weaken, if not annul, all the decla- “ rations they have hitherto made, and be entirely (&lt; inconsistent with the good understanding which “ now exists between this country and the Govern- “ ment of the Khedive. “ Whether circumstances may at any future time “ render a change necessary in the policy hitherto adopted, is a matter on which Lord Hartington “ will not now enter. He merely deals with 3 the “ question as it stands. It is, of course, impossible “ not to see that the march of events may make it “ difficult for this country to persevere inflexibly in “ its present attitude on this question. Such' an “ eventuality, for instance, as that indicated in “ M. Mancini’s recent speech in the Italian Chamber “ of Deputies, to the effect that the Egyptian “ Government had declared that it claime'd ‘ no “‘sovereignty or jurisdiction over Assab Bay,* “ would, if true, lead to a reconsideration of the “ whole question. But in the absence of any such “ renunciation no sufficient reasons exist, in Lord “ Hartington’s opinion, for any modification of the “ position hitherto taken up in regard to it by Her “ Majesty’s Government. “ Lord Hartington is, of course, aware that the “ Italian Government propose that the negotiations “ on the modus vivendi treated in the letter should “ be carried on ‘ without prejudice to any question “ ‘ of the rights of sovereignty over Assab ;’ but he “ regards this as a mere form of words which would20 “ in no way save Her Majesty’s Government the “ inconvenience which would be entailed by a “ concurrence in the scheme propounded. “ In regard to the question raised about the “ slave trade, Lord Hartington has no special re- “ mark to make, further than to say that the “ observations he has already made appear to him “ to apply equally to the proposals under this “ head made by the Italian Government. But His “ Lordship feels that neither this, nor the other “ question dealt with in this letter, has any direct “ bearing on Indian interest. Whilst, therefore, he “ is glad to be able to assist the Secretary of State “ for Foreign Affairs in his consideration of the “ Italian proposals by a full expression ol his own “ views upon them, he must leave the decision to “ be arrived at in regard to them to the independent “ responsibility and judgment of the Secretary of “ State for Foreign Affairs.” The decision of Her Majesty’s Government was communicated to General Menabrea verbally on the 19th August.* Lord Granville said that he had consulted the Secretary of State for India on the subject, and that, after full consideration, the conclusion had been come to that the proposal was one which Her Majesty’s Government could not accept. He recapitulated briefly what had passed between the two Governments in regard to the question, reminding General Menabrea that Her Majesty’s Government had throughout maintained that the legitimate sovereignty of the coast belonged unquestionably to the Euler of Egypt, governing under the suzerainty of the Sultan, and that they could not admit that that sovereignty could be in validated or interrupted by the action of any local Chief. Her Majesty’s Government had consented to take note of the assurances given by Signor Cairoli that no Italian Government establishment of a military character would ever be formed at Assab, and that no troops or fortifications would be maintained, either on the mainland or on the islands in the Bay. But they had at the same time stated that they were unable to make sucb a declaration as had been desired by the Italian Ministers, to the effect that the establishment at Assab Bay not only met with no opposition on the part of Her Majesty’s Government, but would receive their moral support. They had felt that such a declaration w r ould be at variance with the language hitherto held, and would put the Egyptian Government in a false position. For the same reason Her Majesty’s Government felt that they must decline the present proposal. They considered that it would be inconsistent with their previous attitude, and would be liable to be construed as a practical recognition of territorial rights of which they denied the validity. General Menabrea said that he regretted this decision; that whatever might be the view taken by Her Majesty’s Government of the rights of the question, the existence of the Italian establishment * Lord Granville to Mr. Macdonell; No. 354,19th August 1881.

Under such circumstances it was often found to be a matter of international convenience to make such arrange ments as seemed best suited for an altered condition of circumstances, while avoiding any act that necessarily implied approval or formal recognition. It was for this purpose that the proposal under discussion had been made, and he thought that it might have been accepted without committing Her Majesty’s Government to any abandonment of principle. He added that the Italian Government were ready to make any declaration that might be required as to such an arrangement not implying any recognition of the question of right. The remark in this Office letter of the 26th July,* as to an alleged renunciation by the Egyptian Government of its rights of sovereignty over Assab Bay, was elicited by the report of a conversation in the Italian Chamber on the 28th June,+ respecting the affair at Beilul, when Signor Mancini stated positively that the Egyptian Government had lately declared that it claimed no sovereignty or jurisdiction oyer Assab Bay, though it did over Beilul. Her Majesty’s Agent in Egypt was instructed (13th July 1881, No. 131) to inquire of the Egyptian Government whether it was the case that they had renounced the sovereignty hitherto claimed by the Khedive, under the Sultan, over any part of the western shore of the Red Sea. Mr. Cookson, on the 5th August (No. 211), for warded the reply which he had received from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fakhry Pasha, to this inquiry, J in which the assertion of Signor Mancini was declared to be entirely incorrect, as the Egyptian Government had never ceased pro testing in the most formal terms against the pre tended acquisition of the Bay of Assab by the Rubattino Company. In proof of this the Minister enclosed copy of a Despatch, with appended Memorandum, which he had addressed to M. de Martino on the 6th July, and also copy of a Note, in which, on the 25th July, he disputed the right of M. Bianchi to the title conferred on him of “ Civil Commissioner at Assab,” as being one which seemed to confer upon a foreign functionary some power within Egyptian territory. • The Minister’s Despatch of the 6th July above referred to is an important paper, § being, in fact, a reply to the Italian Note and Memoire of May 1880. || It called attention to the fact that, in spite of past assurances of the Italian Government, things were occurring at Assab which pointed to a political occupation of the place, to the prejudice of the sovereign authority of the Khedive. In respect to the territorial rights of His High ness, it was observed:— “ La Baie d’Assab etait comprise dans le terri- “ toire de 1’Empire de Zeilah, fond5 au premier “ si&amp;cle de 1’Hegire par les conqu^rants Arabes. 6005. F24 c ‘ that the understanding exists with Her Majesty’s “ Government (even if disadvantageous to them). “ Italian Ambassador lias led his Government to “ infer that your Lordship declines to interfere in “ the matter,'but the Government urgently pray for “ an answer. If favourable, they will esteem it as “ a marked token of friendship. “ Their request for an early answer is obviously “ to enable them to prepare public opinion here. “ They will, if unsuccessful, I venture to fear, be “ then found less pliant, and perhaps will adopt a “ course which they are most desirous to avoid.” Lord Granville replied on the 13th Septem ber :—* “ Inform the Italian Government that, if they are willing to enter into a formal convention with “ Egypt, which shall confirm their purchases of “ territory at Assah, on the condition that, in “ accordance with their previous assurances, the “ Settlement shall he purely commercial, and shall “ not be fortified or used as a military or naval “ station, Her Majesty’s Government will sound “ the Egyptian Government and the Porte as to “ their willingness to accept the proposal, and will “ support it. “ The Egyptians will probably, if they assent, “ require some provisions for the prevention of the “ transit of arms to Abyssinia.”*)* It is not yet known in this Office what reception this proposal has met with from the Italian Go vernment. Correspondence connected with a proposed Disembarkation of Egyptian Troops at Ra- heita.— The urgent necessity for some settlement of the question has, within the last month, been brought prominently before the Governments interested by the circumstances now to be narrated. On the 24th August, J Mr. Cookson, Acting J From Foreign Office, 25th August 1881 British Agent and Consul General in Egypt, tele- No - 607 * graphed to the Foreign Office as follows:— “ Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs has “ informed me that Egyptian Commissioners at Beilul &lt;£ have reported that Commander of Italian corvette “ formally warned them that he was aware of the in- “ tention of the Egyptian Government to land troops “ at Raheita, south of Assab, and that he has orders . “ from his Government to oppose, by every means ** in his power, the exercise of any act of authority “ by the Egyptians at that place, which he claims “ as belonging to Italy. The Egyptian Govern- “ ment has written to Italian Acting Consul “ General, asking that instructions may be tele- “ graphed to the Commander disapproving his con- “ duct, and has ordered Egyptian vessel carrying “ soldiers destined for Raheita to execute its “ original orders to disembark them there. “ Egyptian Government prays Her Majesty’s “ Government to order an English vessel to pro- “ ceed at once to Raheita, with instructions not to * As above. f See post, p. 29.• From No. 627. t See ante, p. 5. 25 “ recognize any authority there hut that of the “ Khedive under the Sultan, in order to avoid by its presence or intervention any complication which may arise if the Italian Commander per- “ sists in his attitude.” Hie papers upon which this telegram were based were sent home by Mr. Cookson in a Despatch Foreign Office, 31st August ; dated the 24th August, No. 222.* These were two notes, addressed by Takhry Pasha, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, to the Italian and British Agents m Egypt respectively. The note to the Italian Agent (23rd August), recited what had passed between Captain Frigerio, commandant of the Italian corvette “Ettore Fieramosca,” and the Egyptian Commissioners at Beilul; expressed the astonishment of the Egyptian Government, bearing in mind the fact that, so far back as the 16th May 1871, the Italian Government had officially ad mitted that in 1863 the Porte had nominated an official to the Dankali coast, and had caused the Turkish flag to be planted along it as far as Raheita; and added that, since the cession of the coast to Egypt, the Khedive’s Government had never failed to maintain in those parts a Sheikh, nominated and paid by it, “pour la garde du “ drapeau et la surveillance du territoire qui ddpend “ de cette locality.” Fakhry Pasha’s note to Mr. Cookson (23rd August) enclosed a copy of this communication, called attention to the facts cited in it, and pressed for the despatch of a British ship to Raheita. In giving Mr. Cookson the note, the Minister ob served, that as Her Majesty’s Government recently consented, at the request of the Italian Govern ment, to send a vessel to Beilul, f he hoped they would not refuse a similar request on the part of the Government of the Khedive, made under cir cumstances of much more urgency, and involving much more seriously the common interests of Egypt and England. f From Foreign No. 607.

Upon receipt of Mr. Cookson’s telegrams Lord Granville requested to be favoured with Lord Hartington’s views in the matter at his earliest convenience^ These were given in a letter from Sir L. Mallet, dated the 29th August, as follows :—“ Lord Hart- “ ington is unwilling to recommend any action “ Avhich may possibly lead to serious consequences, “ the responsibility for which would rest principally “ with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; “ but as an expression of His Lordship’s views is “ desired, I am to state that his opinions on the “ subject of the Italian occupation of Assab, in “ relation to the rights of sovereignty of the Porte 6005.

Signor Malvano urgently requested Mr. Macdonell to assure Lord Granville that the Italian Government had no intention whatever to extend their territory at Assab; their only object now was to find a satisfactory solution which would enable them to escape in a dignified manner from the embarrassments by which they were beset; but that the course pursued by the Egyptian Govern ment, if persisted in, could only lead to insuperable difficulties at Assab, and render their position at home untenable. On the 30th Augustf Mr. Cookson telegraphed from Alexandria that Eakhry Pasha had communi cated to him a Despatch received from the Italian Agent, in the sense of the instructions of his Go vernment, already cited, adding that in consequence of this formal refusal to recognize its rights over Paheita, the Egyptian Government would be obliged to take measures to secure its authority over the African coast of the Ped Sea, but before coming to any definite decision desired to know the answer of Her Majesty’s Government to their request for the despatch of a British ship of war to Paheita. The Egyptian Minister positively denied an allegation of the Italian Government, that the object in send ing troops to Paheita was to take advantage of the Beilul massacre to change the statu quo at Assab. He declared that orders for the step had been given before that unfortunate event occurred. J On the 31st August, Lord Granville informed General Menabrea, in reply to his Note of the 26th, that although Her Majesty’s Government had no wish that the matter should be raised, yet it was out of the question for them to object to the Egyptian Government acting upon rights which Her Majesty’s Government had always supported, and still believed to be well founded.^ However, on the 1st September, in reply to his various telegrams, Mr. Cookson was instructed to inform the Egyptian Government that, without raising any question as to their right to disembark troops at Paheita, Her Majesty’s Government did28 not recommend the exercise of that right by their immediate disembarkation, inasmuch as it might provoke complications which might be avoided by further discussions/ i. e., as was explained in a Despatch to Mr. Cookson (No. 158, of 1st Septem ber) between the Governments interested. In communicating (3rd September) this advice to the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Mr. Cookson ob served that the Italian Government having declared that they had never claimed, and did not intend to claim, Raheita as a dependency of Assab, had vir tually disavowed the language reported to have been used by Captain Frigerio, by which the place was claimed as belonging to Italy, and that this declaration ought to satisfy the Egyptian Govern ment as to any fear that their abstention from landing troops might be interpreted as a surrender of their territorial rights.f With reference to the true relations between the Egyptian Government and the Sheikh of Raheita, Eakhry Pasha said that, up to the end of 1880, that personage was receiving pay from the Egyptian Government, who held his receipts for it, though he had recently come to be entirely under the influence of the Italians at Assab, and had even taken refuse in their ship. The Egyptian Government could not, therefore, admit the right of this Sheikh to make treaties with a foreign Power, still less to bind Egypt by them. Mr. Cookson added, as instructed, that there seemed reason to hope that, if the Egyptian Govern ment now abstained from taking the step which had been objected to by Italy, further negotiations might lead to a more satisfactory understanding on the question at issue between the two Govern ments ; and he pointed out, as he had done before, the danger of forcing the hand of the Italian Government, which stood in a somewhat delicate position in regard to public opinion in Italy itself. lakliry Pasha gave Mr. Cookson to understand that he would follow the advice given, but that in consequence of the pretensions raised by the De spatches of M. Macchiavellif it would not be possible to make any formal engagement not to exercise their full rights on the coast of the Red Sea. This Mr. Cookson told His Excellency he understood was also the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government. Later in the day Mr. Cookson received a visit on behalf of Eakhry Pasha, from Tigrane Bey, the Secretary General for Foreign Affairs, who showed him a Note which had been presented by M. Mac- chiavelli toFakhry Pasha. This Note was without signature when handed in, but His Excellency re quested M. Macchiavelli to sign it, and it was left without any conversation having taken place. The Note stated the view which the Italian Government would take of the proposed disembarkation of troops at Raheita if it were effected. It com mented in strong language upon what it called the derisory result of the late inquiry at Beilul, ac cusing the Governor of Massowah, one of the * From Foreign Office, 1st September; No. 634. | Mr. Cookson to Lord Granville, 3rd September 1881; No. 227. From Foreign Office, 16th September; No. 679. t The Italian Agent.Egyptian Commissioners, of himself having been an accomplice in the massacre of the Italian party, and expressed the conclusions to which the Italian Government would come, first, that the Egyptian Government would have unfairly taken advantage of that unfortunate event; and, secondly, that the uncalled for disembarkation of troops at Raheita must he resisted by Italy as an act of hostility directly aimed at the Italian position at Assab and the maintenance of the statu quo. Tigrane Bey said that this Note seemed quite contrary to what Eakhry Pasha had been led to expect from what Mr. Cookson had told him, and that it could only tend to envenom the discussion between the two Governments by the introduction into the question as to disembarkation of Egyptian troops at Raheita, of an irritating topic which ought to form the subject of a separate discussion. At the request of Tigrane Bey, Mr. Cookson undertook to see M. Macchiavelli and ask him whether, in consequence of what had recently passed between the Cabinets of London and Rome, he could not withdraw the Note, which he suspected had been written under instructions previous to the date of the latest communication from Rome. He accordingly went to M. Macchiavelli, and told him confidentially the advice which had been given to the Egyptian Government, and asked him whether, now that it was almost certain that this would be followed, he could not withdraw a Note which seemed to be very unlikely to assist an amicable arrangement of the question. M. Mac chiavelli confirmed Mr. Cookson’s anticipation that the Note had been dictated to him by a Despatch re ceived some days before, and consented to telegraph for permission to withdraw it. He explained that, in order to soften as much as possible the effect of the term,s of the Note, he had only presented it without signature as a summary statement of the views of the Italian Government at the time it was written. In reporting to Lord Granville what had passed, Mr. Cookson added :— “ If the Note is withdrawn, it is the intention of “ the Egyptian to reply to all the arguments put “ forward as pretexts for the Italian intervention “ at Raheita, but not to proceed at present to carry “ out the plan of sending troops there, even though “ this plan was already formed, and the troops “ embarked, before the massacre at Beilul. “ Eakhry Pasha, as well as Riaz Pasha, whom “ I saw later in the day, expressed a strong hope “ that Her Majesty’s Government would now give “ them assistance in settling before long the whole “ question of the Italian claim to Assab. The “ pretensions of Italy are regarded by the Egyptian “ Government as a standing menace to the financial “ and political interests of Egypt, as, if the Italians “ succeed in their object of establishing a trade “ with Abyssinia, the most important article of im-44 portation will probably be weapons for the arming ,&lt;t of that dangerous and aggressive neighbour.” Concurrently, on the 3rd September, General Menabrea visited Lord Granville at Walmer Castle, for the purpose of discussing the matter. His Excellency brought with him an extract of a telegram which he had received from his Govern ment, and which lie read. It was a comment on the reply returned by Lord Granville on the 31st August to the Italian request that Her Majesty’s Govern ment should dissuade the Egyptian authorities from their intention of landing troops at Eaheita. It stated that it appeared from Lord Granville’s lan guage that the object of this request had not been understood. The Italian Government did not ask that of Her Majesty to make objections to the sovereignty of Egypt over Eaheita, nor to say or do anything to prejudge the general ques tion of sovereignty over the west coast of the Red Sea. What they had asked, and hoped to obtain, was that Her Majesty’s Government should make use of their incontestable influence with the Egyptian Government to advise it to abstain from an act which might have the most unfortunate conse quences. They asked this as a friendly service, and they believed that, in their owm interest, Her Majesty’s Government ought to be inclined to render it. Eor Her Majesty’s Government, on the one hand, must assuredly recognize that complica tions in the Red Sea might become dangerous, and on the other hand, should be anxious to prevent public opinion in Italy being excited and led astray. After the support which Italy had faithfully given for tw T o years to Her Majesty’s Government in every question which affected England, either slightly or closely, the Italian Government consi dered that they might on this occasion count upon an act of reciprocity, and they would feel their dis appointment all the more keenly if their expecta tions were deceived, inasmuch as they would be unable to explain to themselves the reasons for a refusal. General Menabrea then recapitulated the'request which had been made by his Government, and the answer given him. He complained strongly of the conduct of the Egyptian Government, and said that the inquiry into the recent massacre at Beilul had been a farce. Although the criminals were well known, although they were actually wearing the dresses of the victims, the Egyptian Government had produced none of them. A proof how idle the procedure had been wes given, he said, by the fact that the Captain of the English vessel of war present, wko had no orders to take any part or to make any observations, wdien he was asked by the Egyptian Pasha to give a sort of certificate of the regularity of the proceedings, had indignantly and con temptuously refused. General Menabrea said that the conduct of the Egyptian Government as to this inquiry, and their subsequent pretension to disturb the status quo in1 m No*651 0 ™ F ° reign 0ffice&gt; 6th September; 31 the immediate neighbourhood of Assab, made it impossible for the Italian Government, in the face of public opinion in Italy, to remain quiet. He therefore begged that Lord Granville would eive particular attention to the request made in the telegram which he had just read. His Excellency then alluded to the position of the Italians at Assah Bay. Their contention, he said, was that ^ they were on exactly the same grounds as to right as the English were at Aden ; that the Egyptians had, in fact, no rights of sovereignty in these countries; that their onlv attempts to exercise them were of a vexatious character, and not in the direction of government ! h TT pi ?P er sense of the word - He was aware that lier Majesty’s Government did not admit this doctrine, and there was no question at this moment of raising the point in dispute between the two Governments. r !he Italian Government only asked Her Majesty’s Government to take the step indi cated in the telegram he had just read, and thus to avoid serious complications, which could be of no possible advantage to us, and might have very inconvenient consequences. Lord Granville told His Excellency the reply which had been given to the application of the Egyptian Government. He pointed out that Her Majesty’s Government had anticipated the request of the Italian Government, but with this distinc tion, that their advice was not absolute—it was only that the Egyptians should remain quiet for the present, and thus give time for the careful discussion of the subject. General Menabrea spoke of the excellent under standing which had existed between the two countries since the accession of Mr. Gladstone to power, and of the cordiality with which the Italian Government had co-operated with Her Majesty’s Government in every question which had arisen. He expressed a strong hope that on this occasion Her Majesty’s Government would act in the same spirit. Lord Granville replied, that General Menabrea must be perfectly aware of the feelings entertained by Mr. Gladstone and himself towards Italy, and of their desire that the best possible relations should exist between the two countries. He said that it would be the desire of Her Majesty’s Go vernment in this, as in all other circumstances, to act in as conciliatory a manner as possible. This question, however, of Assab Bay was one of great difficulty. The language of Her Majesty’s Govern ment on the subject to Italy, Turkey/and Egypt had throughout been the same, and he believed that perfect frankness on both sides was the best policy that could be pursued. The foregoing conversation was embodied in a Despatch from Lord Granville to Her Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires at Rome, dated the 3rd Septem ber, No. 374.* A separate Despatch to the same gentleman, dated the 5th September, No. 375, summarized32 what had passed in the matter, and, after stating the advice which had been given to the Egyptian Government, concluded:— “ Having thus recommended the Egyptian Go- “ vernment to act with caution so as to prevent “ complications, Her Majesty’s Grovernment trust “ the Government of Italy will send instructions “ of a conciliatory character to their naval officers “ in the neighbourhood of Assab. “ Her Majesty’s Government cannot depart from “ the language they have always used, both to the &lt;c Porte and to the Egyptian Government, and “ which is well known to the Italian Government, &lt;c viz., that to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire “ in the first instance, and under His Majesty to “ the Khedive, belongs the sovereignty of the “ coast on which are situated Assab and Raheita.” A.

This section concludes with two reports suggesting that, although the Italians had not made much progress at Assab Bay, they had shown their intention to get a foothold on the African continent.The second section reproduces correspondence between the British, Italian and Egyptian governments, and between the India Office and the Foreign Office from May 1880 to September 1881. The correspondence relates to the purchase of land at Assab Bay by the Rubattino Company; Italian Government denials that the territory would be used for military purposes; attempts made by the Italian Government to legitimise their occupation of the place by encouraging the British Government to accredit a British Agent there, both for commercial purposes and for the purpose of co-operation in the suppression of the slave trade; and a British Government proposal that the Italian Government enter into a formal convention about the matter with the Egyptian Government.The final section reproduces correspondence connected with a proposed disembarkation of Egyptian troops at Raheita to the south of Assab Bay; Egyptian appeals for a British warship to be sent to the area; Italian protestations that disembarkation at Raheita would constitute a provocation; and the British Government's re-affirmation that the sovereignty of the coastline at Raheita and Assab Bay belongs to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the Khedive of Egypt.The paper is written by Arthur William Moore.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Italy</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Egypt</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Assab Bay</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003e5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
