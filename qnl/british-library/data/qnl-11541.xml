MY LORD, To the flattering partiality with which you regarded and encouraged my efforts in the Public Service, I owe those opportunities which have enabled me to write the History of Persia. In dedicating it to your Lordship, therefore, I follow the impulse both of gratitude and of duty : but had these considerations not prompted me to offer you this sincere token of my respect and attachment, I might have claimed, on other grounds, the right of prefixing to this Work the Name of one, whose Administration of the British Possessions in India has connected his Fame with the History of almost every Kingdom of Asia. I have the honor to be, MY LORD, With the greatest respect. Your Lordship's most faithful And obedient Servant, JOHN MALCOLM.PREFACE. VV HILST the Annals of almost every Nation that can boast of any political importance have been illustrated by eminent British Writers, Persia seems hitherto to have been generally neglected. It must, therefore, be allowed to be highly desirable that this blank in our Literature should be filled up, and that the English reader should be made acquainted with the history and condition of a people, who have in most ages acted a conspicuous part on the theatre of the world; and who have of late acquired peculiar claims to our attention, from the nature of their relations to British India, and from the renewal of their intercourse with the States of Europe. Though I have for many years contemplated such a Work as an object of utility and importance, a sense of my own want of qualifications as an Author long deterred me from undertaking it. I had left my native country and entered the army of Indiaviii PREFACE. at an age when those who aim at literary eminence are only commencing their studies : and when I first had opportunities of collecting the materials which form the basis of my present Work, I neither enjoyed, nor had any prospect of enjoying, the necessary leisure for putting them into a form to meet the public eye. A number of advantageous circumstances, however, concurred by degrees in ultimately removing the doubts which these difficulties had at first excited in my mind. During the last fifteen years, I have three times visited Persia in the charge of political missions ; and I have for almost the whole of that period been intrusted with the conduct of the nego tiations between that State and the British Government in India. The nature of my public employment, which led to my travelling over almost all the provinces of Persia, gradually improved the know ledge I had before possessed of that kingdom and its inhabitants; and a sense of duty, as well as the natural curiosity which I felt of investigating the state of a country so imperfectly known to Europeans, equally urged me to endeavour to amass useful information of every description; whilst it may be easily conceived, that the diplomatic character %PREFACE. with which I was invested greatly facilitated my progress in the attainment of this object. What I have now said will show that I do not come forward, as an Author, with those pretensions which belong to men of high literary attainments; but that the prosecution of my public duties first led me to feel the want of a History of Persia, and subsequently involved me in an effort, which, under other circumstances, I should never have contem plated. I do not, however, state this fact with a view of deprecating criticism, or of claiming indul gence : I am fully aware that the fate of every work must be determined by its own merit; and have, therefore, laboured to render that which I have undertaken as complete as possible. I have studied perspicuity ; I have sought truth : and my opinions, which are invariably expressed with freedom, may perhaps have some value from being those of a man whose only lessons have been learned in the school of experience. The History of Persia may be divided into two parts: the ancient and the modern. The former, which commences in the fabulous ages, terminates in the conquest of that country by the Caliph Omar, in vol . i. bPREFACE. the thirty-first year of the Hejirah. Throughout this period the Persians come in frequent contact with the great European nations of antiquity : hut as my principal object in undertaking this Work was to supply information that could not be obtained from the historians of Greece and Rome, I have in general followed Eastern authors : and their narrations of the events of these distant periods will at least be deemed, by the European reader, a subject of just literary curiosity. The materials from which this part of my Work is composed, are fully stated in the seventh chapter, which is in fact a dissertation upon the ancient history of Persia. I almost fear that this chapter may be deemed too long. It necessarily recapitulates many events that had been previously stated : but I was more willing to meet the charge of tautology, than to run the risk of not rendering complete in itself this difficult and interesting branch of my subject. In the modern parts of the History of Persia I have studied brevity, as far as was consistent with the intro duction of every fact that appeared of importance : but the subject was so copious and diverging, that it required a constant effort to confine myself withinPREFACE. xi the proposed limits. In one point I have perhaps indulged in a greater latitude than has usually been assumed by writers of history. I have not unfre- quently endeavoured to enliven and to illustrate my - subject by the relation of occurrences in which I was personally concerned. This I did under an impression that the character of nations, as well as individuals, may often be better appreciated from anecdotes, than from a mere narration of events: and when such passages occur, they will, in addition to that light which they throw upon facts and observations, serve to remind the reader of what I before stated, that if I had not been a traveller I should never have been an historian. In the course of this Work I have carefully con sulted every European Author of eminence who has investigated the history and literature of the oriental nations. But as I have always quoted, in my notes, the names of those by whose labour I have profited, it would be superfluous to mention them here, the more especially as their well-established reputation could derive no increase from my eulogiums. I have to acknowledge, with sincere gratitude, the aid of those whom motives of personal friendship have induced to promote the success of this Work.Xll PREFACE. To the kindness of Sir James Mcintosh, and to that interest which he takes in every effort to illustrate Eastern history, I owe the greatest obligations. I am also much indebted to Mr. William Erskine* of Bombay, from whom I received several valuable communications : and I feel, that if my attempt to throw light upon the more remote periods of Persian history should prove satisfactory to the reader, I shall, in a very considerable degree, owe my success to Mr. Alexander Hamilton, of Hertford College, whose superior knowledge of every branch of oriental litera ture enabled him to give me the most essential assistance in this difficult and important part of my Work. Before I left India I was indebted to Mr. N. H. Smith, late Envoy to the Court of Scind, for the communications of his Journals, and for remarks upon the character of the Arabian tribes settled on the shores of the Persian Gulf. I was also under obligations to Since my return to England, I received a very interesting communication from Mr. Erskine on two sepulchral urns, found near Abousheher, which had been sent to him by Mr. Bruce, the British Resident at that place. My observations on similar urns (Vol. I. p. 198) had been printed before I received Mr. Erskine's letter: but it was with the greatest satisfaction I found the opinions I had expressed upon this subject correspond with those of one, on whose learning and judgment I place great reliance.PREFACE. xiii Mr. Bruce, the present Resident of Abusheher, for observations upon the constitution of the Persian army, and the customs* of the wandering tribes; and I have received, since my return to England, some valuable information, upon the same subjects, from Mr. Cormick, Surgeon to the late Embassy in Persia, and from Mr. Willock, who has recently been appointed Charge d'Affaires at the Court of Teheran. It remains to speak of those Officers who accom panied me to Persia, and who were alike led by zeal in the public service, and by personal regard for me, to assist in my researches to obtain information. To Captains Grant and Christief, and Lieutenant Pot- tinger 5 who were deputed by me to explore and * I have received communications upon similar subjects from my friend, Jaaffer Aly Khan, an Indian nobleman, who has long resided at Shiraz: and 1 have, at different periods, obtained valuable memoirs, containing historical facts and anecdotes, from several Persians of rank and reputation, and who are at present residing in that country, and some in high employment. When such information is referred to in the History, it is always marked Persian MS., as many reasons prevented my giving publicity to the names of those by whom it was given to me. t Captain Grant of the Bengal Establishment, and Captain Christie of that of Bombay, were employed by me, on account of their knowledge of the native languages, and the high reputation they had in the armies to which they belonged. Their success justified the selection: but I had soon afterwards to regret the lossPREFACE. report upon the provinces of Mekran, Baloochistan, and Seistan, which divide India from Persia, and who executed that difficult task with a spirit of enterprise that must ever reflect the highest honour on their characters, I owe information, which is the more valuable as it could have been derived from no other source. I am also much indebted to the reports and communications of Captains Frederick and Josiah Stewart, Mr. Henry Ellis, Captain John Briggs, and Captain John M'Donald Kinnier. The latter Officer has since acquired a just reputation by the publication of a Map and Geographical Memoir * on Persia, which is partly compiled from his own surveys and observations, and partly from those of the other Officers who were of Captain Grant, who was murdered by a banditti on his journey from Bagdad to Kermanshah; and Captain Christie lately fell in a contest between the Persians and Russians, m which he gallantly supported the reputation of British valour. Lieutenant Pottinger, who is now Assistant to the Resident at Poonah, has, I am happy to hear, prepared a Work upon the countries through which he travelled; and I have no doubt, from the nature of the subject, and the talents of this Officer, that it will be highly deserving the attention of the public. # Captain John M'Donald Kinnier has, since the publication of his Memoir^ been employed in Asia Minor, and has traversed some of the least known parts of that celebrated country. It is to be hoped that we shall ere long profit by the additional information which this able and enterprising Officer must have acquired in this arduous and dangerous enterprise.PREFACE. XV employed in my several Missions to that country, and which I put into his hands with a confidence in his talents that has not been disappointed. To my relation, Major Pasley, who accompanied me on all my Missions to Persia, and who early acquired an intimate knowledge of the language and character of the inhabitants of that country, I am indebted for important aid in every stage of this Work. To Mr. Andrew Jukes my obligations are equally great. That gentleman, whose long residence in Persia was passed in the attainment of useful knowledge, communicated to me all the information he possessed ; and I owe to his learning and research many important facts illustrative of the science and manners of the people I have endeavoured to describe. I could dwell more than I have done upon this subject, as there is no circumstance connected with my Work so pleasing to my mind as the recollection of the assistance which I have received from those friends whose names have been mentioned. I might indeed swell this list, but I fear that I have already too far intruded my feelings upon the reader. I shall, therefore, content myself with adding, that the Map prefixed to this History may almost be termed as xvi PREFACE. reduction of that of Captain John M^onald Kinnier ; and that the Prints are either taken from original Persian Paintings in my possession, or from Draw ings ^ made on the spot. Id a Work of this nature, I felt it of importance that it should he as correct as possible with respect to the spelling of proper names and Persian words. To accomplish this, I have used that orthography which seemed best adapted to convey to an English reader the sound of the words as pronounced by a native Persian. Attention to this mode has often obliged me to vary from the best oriental scholars, who have only learnt to pronounce Persian proper names from the study of that language in Europe, or in India. I have not, however, altered the orthography of those words which common usage has made familiar to the English reader, and some of which have been adoptedf into our language. * Some of these Drawings I owe to Mr. Jukes; the remainder were made by Mr. Webbe and Mr. Sundt, two young men who accompanied mv last Mission to Persia: the former in the quality of Surveyor, the latter as Draughtsman. t I have, for example, followed the common writing of the Arabian title of Caliph; and I have spelt Caravansary as it is in English dictionaries, though I do not think that orthography very correct. r\CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME.

General Introductory Observations on the Boundaries, Mountains, Deserts, Forests, Rivers, and Climate of the Kingdom of Iran, or Persia. BEFORE we enter upon the history of a people, it appears chap. i. necessary to say a few words respecting the extent and nature of the country in which they dwell. The boundaries of Iranj Boundaries, which Europeans call Persia*, have undergone many changes. The limits of this kingdom, in its most prosperous periods, * This word is generally supposed to be derived from Fars or Pars, a division of the empire of Iran, and applied by Europeans to the whole of that kingdom. It is certainly a word unknown, in the sense we use it, to the present natives of Iran, though some Asiatic writers contend that Pars formerly meant the whole kingdom. In proof of this assertion a passage of the Koran is quoted, in which one of Mahomed's companions, who came from a village near Isfahan, is called Selman of Fars or Pars. vol. i. b ■ 12 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . i. may however be easily described. The Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean ^ to the south, the Indus and the Ox us to the east and Description of Persia. north-east, the Caspian Sea and Mount Caucasus to the north, and the River Euphrates to the west. The most striking features of this extensive country, are numerous chains of mountains, and large tracts of desert: amid which are interspersed beautiful valleys and rich pasture lands. From the mouths of the Indus, to those of the Karoon and the Euphrates, the narrow tract of arid and level country which lies between the mountains and the sea, bears a greater resemblance in soil and climate to Arabia, than to Persia. Though this tract extends in length a distance of more than twenty degrees, it cannot boast of one river-f- that We have also the authority of the Scripture for the name of this kingdom being Paras 1 or Phars. The authors of the Universal History 1 , on what authority I know not, state, that the word Iran is not a general name of Persia, but of a part of that country. This is certainly erroneous: Iran has, from the most ancient times to the present day, been the term by which the Persians call their country; and it includes, in the sense they understand it, all the provinces to the east of the Tigris, Assyria Proper, Media, Parlhia, Persia, and Hyrcania or Mazenderan. The whole of this coantry has probably been styled Pars or Persia in the Bible, and by Greek and Roman writers since Cyrus. * Persian geographers assume more magnificent limits for their ancient empire: they say it included four seas and six great rivers: the Black Sea, the Red Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Persian Gulf; the Euphrates, Tigris, Araxes, Phasis, Indus, and Oxus. t The Zab, which divides the province of Pars from Khuzistan, is navigable fo? boats as far as the town of Endian, a distance of sixteen miles from the sea. 1 It is so named in Daniel, Esdras, &amp;c. a Vol. V. p. £0.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 3 is navigable above a few miles from the ocean. The appearance chap . r. of this coast is almost every where the same — a succession of sandy plains: in viewing which, the eye is occasionally relieved by large plantations of date trees, and by patches of cultivation that are found near the wells, and fresh water rivulets, which are thinly scattered over this extensive but barren region. Inland, from the chain of mountains nearest the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, to the Oxus in one direction, and to the Caspian Sea in another, the most marked features of the country are nearly the same. These are, a succession of mountains and valleys of different elevation and extent. There are only a few of the former which can be termed Mountains, of very extraordinary height, though many ranges have continual snow upon their summits. None of the valleys are broad; but ^ome are of great length, often exceeding one hundred miles. The only tracts within this empire which spread wide, without the interruption of mountains, are salt deserts, of which there are Salt deserts, several: one of the most remarkable is that which extends from the banks of the Heirmund River* in Seistan to the range of hills which divide that province from lower Mekran, a distance of about four hundred miles. This may be deemed the extreme length of the desert. Its breadth from Noosky, a village in Sara wan ^ to Jalk, in upper or northern Mekran, is near two hundred miles. The salt * I have written its name Heirmund because it is generally so termed by Persian authors; but it is also called Helmund. This fine river, (the Etymander of the ancients,) which takes its rise in the mountains of Hazara, to the north of Cabul, flows through Seistan, part of which arid province is fertilized by its streams, and empties itself into the Lake of Zerah. t A district in Mekran.^ THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . i. desert, which extends from the vicinity of the cities of Koom and Kashan to the provinces of Mazenderan and Khorassan, is as long, and some miles broader, than that of Seistan, with which it unites. The exact nature of the vast waste which these form is but little known. It abounds with salt marshes, and encircles the Sea of Zerah, or Lake of Seistan. In many of its dry parts this desert presents to the eye either a crusted coat of brittle earth, or a succession of sand hills. The latter have, in general, the shape of waves, and consist of particles of red sand, so light as to be hardly palpable, which, when scattered by the violent north-west winds that prevail throughout the summer months, form a moving cloud, which often proves alike destructive to animal and to vegetable life. The influence of this great desert on those countries which are in its vicinity, and upon the same level with it, is very great. These are subject to extreme heats : the temperature of Kashan was found, by observations made by Fahrenheit's thermometer, to be about twenty degrees warmer than that of Kohrood, a village situated twenty-five miles from it, in a small valley, on the top of a range of hills, which were certainly not of a height to account for this great difference of temperature, on any calculation that has reference only to elevation. The hills in the interior of Persia are not quite so barren as the ranges which meet the eye of the navigator of the Indian Sea and the Persian Gulf: but none, except those of Mazenderan and of Georgia, are covered with forests. In the north-western parts of Kurdistan, in parts of Pars, and of Khorassan, there are woods intermixed with large trees; but the generality of mountains in Persia are either bare, or thinly clad with underwood.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 5 The valleys of the centre provinces of Persia abound with all the chap. i. rarest and most valuable vegetable productions, and might be Valleys. cultivated to any extent. The pasture grounds of that country are not surpassed by any lands in the world. Trees are seldom found except near the towns or villages: but the luxuriance with which they grow wherever planted, shews that the climate is quite congenial to them. The orchards of Persia produce all the fruits of the temperate zone; and its wilds abound with flowers that can only be reared by care and cultivation in the gardens of Europe. Though there is a resemblance in the principal features of the surface of this kingdom, some of its provinces are marked by a very distinct appearance. In Pars, Irak, and Khorassan, the valleys are generally level. In Aderbijan they appear like a succession of eminences between hills; and Kurdistan may be almost termed one immense cluster of small mountains, occasionally intersected by loftier ranges; on the top of which, as in every other part of Persia, there are table lands, which, from their great elevation, are subject to extreme cold*. Persia has hardly one river which can be termed navigable, Rivefs. unless the Euphrates and the Tigris may be considered as belonging to that empire. The Karoon in Khuzistan, the Arras or Araxes in Aderbijan, and the Heirmund, which flows through the province of Seistan, are the largest within its ordinary limits. The rains, except in Mazenderan, are neither frequent nor heavy; and a * In the year 1810, when encamped on the plain of Hubatoo in Kurdistan, the water in my tent froze to near half an inch thick on the 17th of August. The latitude was thirty-six degrees north, and Fahrenheit's thermometer, at 6 a. m., stood at thirty-four.6 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , i. want of water is undoubtedly to be deemed the great obstacle to the general fertility of the country. In its more prosperous days*, astonishing efforts were made by its inhabitants to overcome this natural defect: but the local situation of Persia was unhappy; and the ravages of barbarous invaders often destroyed in a day the labours of a century, and made a nation recede in despair from its progress in improvement. Climate and The climate of this kingdom is very various. It is not more Productions. affected by the difference of latitude, than by the opposite nature of the soil, and by the remarkable inequalities of the surface of almost all its provinces. The greater part of the country, as has been stated, is a succession of plains at the base of those ridges of hills by which it is intersected, and of table lands nearly on a level with their tops. To pass from the lower valleys to the higher, is to change the temperature of summer for that of winter. But the climate, though various, is healthy; and few countries can boast a more robust, active, and well-formed race of men. Its animals (particularly horses and dogs) are of uncommon size, strength, and beauty. Its vegetable productions have been noticed. In its mountains some valuable minerals are found, but none in any abundance; and Persia has consequently been always indebted to foreign countries for lead, iron, silver, arid gold. * In the small, but fine, district of Nishabore in Khorassan, there are said to have been twelve thousand water-courses.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAPTER II. An Account of the Dynasty of Mah-abad and other Fabulous Kings of Persia before the Period of Kaiomurs. If we desire to be fully informed of a nation's history, we must not reject the fables under which the few traces that remain of its origin are concealed. These, however extravagant, always merit attention. They have an influence on the character of the people to whom they relate. They mix with their habits, their literature, and sometimes with their religion. They become, in short, national legends, which it is sacrilege to doubt: and to question the deeds of a Roostum would raise, in the breast of a Persian, all those feelings which would be excited in that of an Englishman if he heard a foreigner detract from the great name of Alfred. Such heroes often rise in importance (as far as their example is of value) in proportion as their real history is lost in obscurity : they are adopted as models by the painters and the poets of their country: every human virtue is ascribed to them: and men are taught their duty from fables decorated with names which they have learnt to venerate from their cradle, and the love of which is cherished with all the enthusiasm of national pride. In almost all modern accounts of Persia which have been translated from Mahomedan authors, Kaiomurs is considered the8 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.il first king of that country: but the Dabistan*, a book professedly compiled from works of the ancient Guebers, or worshippers of fire, presents us with a chapter on a succession of monarchs and prophets who preceded Kaiomurs. According to its author, the Persians, previous to the reign of Kaiomurs, and consequently long before the mission of Zoroaster-f, venerated a prophet called Mah- abad, (or the great Abad,) whom they considered as the father of men. We are told in the Dabistan, that the ancient Persians deemed it impossible to ascertain who were the first parents of the human race. The knowledge of man, they alleged, was quite incompetent to such a discovery: but they believed, on the authority Mah-abad, of their books, that Mah-abad was the person left at the end of the the first king. last great cycle J; and, consequently, the father of the present world. The only particulars they relate of him are, that he and his wife, having survived the former cycle, were blessed with a numerous progeny, who inhabited caves and clefts of rocks, and were uninformed of both the comforts and luxuries of life: that they were at first strangers to order and government, but that Mah-abad, inspired and aided by Divine Power, resolved to alter their condition; and, to * The doubtful authority of this work has received some support from the recent discovery of a volume in the ancient Pehlivi, (called the Dussateer, or Temarawatseer,) to which its author refers. + The Persian name of this prophet of the Guebers is Zerdosht. I have thought it right to adopt, in names so familiar to the English reader, the common etymology. t Tlie J believe time to be divided into a succession of cycles or periods, to each of which they allot its own people, believing that a male and female are left at the end of every cycle, to be the parents of the population of the next.

Mah-abad had thirteen successors of his own family; all of whom Thirteen mo- iiAii it i i m narchs of the are styled Abad, and deemed prophets. They were at once the race of Mah- monarchs and the high priests of the country; and, during their abad reigns, the world, we are informed, enjoyed a golden age; which was, however, disturbed by an act of Azer-abad, the last prince of Azer-abad, the Mahabadian dynasty, who abdicated the throne, and retired to abdicates' the a life of solitary devotion throne ' By the absence of Azer-abad his subjects were left to the free indulgence of their passions, and every species of excess was the consequence. The empire became a scene of rapine and of murder. To use the extravagant expression of our author*, the mills, from which men were fed, were turned by the torrents of blood that flowed from the veins of their brothers; every art and science fell into oblivion; the human race became as beasts of prey, and returned to their former rude habitations in caverns and mountains. Some sages, who viewed the state of the empire with compassion, entreated Jy-affram-f, a saint-like, retired man, to assume the govern ment.

This agreement may either form an argument for or against the authenticity of the text, as we are disposed to give the author of the Dabistan credit for correctness, or otherwise. If he actually writes from Pehlivi authorities, it must be received as a proof of correspondent history between the Hindoos and Persians; but if, on the contrary, he has built up his hypothesis with a disposition to approximate the history of ancient Persia and India, this similarity of names must detract from his credit.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 11 few that remained had fled to woods and mountains, when the all- chap. ii. merciful Creator called Kaiomurs, or Gilshah, to the throne. But, Order restored before I proceed to an account of his reign, which is the epoch by Kaiomurs. at which all histories of Persia (hitherto published) commence, it will be necessary to say a few words regarding Mah-abad and his descendants. The period of years ^ ascribed to each of the dynasties which I have noticed, is so far beyond all bounds of credibility, that they would appear more like calculations applicable to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, than dates referrible to real history. If we could rely upon the authenticity of the Dabistan so far, as to be satisfied that those parts of this work which relate to Persia were actually composed from the ancient Pehlivi books, to which its author so frequently refers, it would prove, beyond further discussion, that one of the most ancient and sacred institutions of the Hindoos, the classification of the society into casts, if it did not originate in Persia, was known in that country before the intro duction of the worship of Zoroaster. But this subject, as well as the religion of Mah-abad and his successors, will be noticed here after. All that we yet possess relative to this remote period is quite obscure, and merits but a cursory notice: it is too general and indistinct to possess even that interest which belongs to those periods of a nation's history where truth and fable mix, and from which we often derive amusement, and sometimes instruction. * The dynasty of the Jy-anians fs stated to have endured one aspar; which, accord ing to the computation made from a Pehlivi work, is a term denoting a thousand millions of years.12 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAPTER III. The Paishdadian Dynasty of Kings. chap . ii. According to all Mahomedan writers, except the author of the Pakistan, Kaiomurs* was the first monarch of Persia. They follow Kaiomurs, the ^ first king. the chronology of the Jews, and trace his descent to Noah. This king is stated-f* to have reclaimed his subjects from a state of the most savage barbarity. He was, we are told by one author J, the son of Yessan-Ajum, while others call him the grandson of Noah 1|: all agree in acknowledging him as the founder of a dynasty, which is known in history as that of the Paishdadian, or first distributers of justice. The efforts of Kaiomurs to civilize mankind were, in the begin ning, only successful with his own family; the rest remained in their savage habits, and carried on a war with this monarch, whose son, Siamuck, was slain in one of his battles with them.

Houshung, the second ruler of the Paishdadian dynasty, was a prince renowned for justice and wisdom: but we find a great difference among Persian authors, both as to the events and the period of his reign. He is said to have founded some noble cities, and to have invented* many useful arts; and his name is perpetuated in Persia as the first who constructed aqueducts-j -. A work J of some merit, which has been quoted by Persian authors, is ascribed to this prince. He reigned forty years, and was succeeded by his son, Tahamurs, commonly called Deev-bund, or the Magician- bindery ; a title he derived from the success with which he warred against the enemies of his family. He was, according to Persian fable, aided in those wars by the supernatural wisdom of his prime minister, Sheerasp, who, we are informed, used all kinds of spells and enchantments to entrap the deevs. These, however, would appear to have been superior to their conquerors in knowledge; for * Ferdosi states that this king first discovered fire by the collision of flint stones, and ordained its worship as the Nour-e-Khodah, or Light of God. f These aqueducts are made by a succession of small wells at the distance of a few yards from each other, and of such depth as the level and soil require: they are connected with each other at the bottom by a channel, large enough for a man to pass to clear it. These wells commence at a spring, and not only convey its waters, but that of such other springs as are found in the course of the canal: they are common through all Persia; the water they convey is applied to irrigation.

A malignant disease introduced, had raged for so long a time in Persia, that men, distracted at losing its origin, many of their dearest friends and relations, desired to preserve the memory of them by busts and images, which they kept in their houses, as some consolation under their affliction.

D. 1253, by Louis the Ninth of France, (commonly called St. Louis,) to the Court of Mangou Khan, the grandson of Chenghiz, is a remarkable illustration of this passage. The author writes from the City of Cailac, in Tartary, ' After I had sat awhile,' he observes, ' with these priests, and entered into their ' temple, and seen many of their images both great and small, I demanded of them, ' What they believed concerning God? They answered, We believe that there i» ' only one God. Whether do you believe that he is a spirit or some bodily ' substance? They said, We believe that he is a spirit. Then said I, Do you ' believe that God ever took man's nature upon him? They answered, No. Again ' I said, Since you believe that he is a spirit, to what end do you make so many ' bodily images to represent him ? Since also you believe that he was not made man, ' why do you rather represent him by the image of a man than of any other ' creature ? Then they answered. We frame not these images to represent God ; ' but when any rich man amongst us, or his son, or his wife, or any of his friends ' dieth, he causeth the image of the dead person to be made, and to be placed here; ' and we, in remembrance of him, do reverence thereunto. I replied then, Do you16 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAP. III. Tahamurs governed Persia thirty years.

He was immoderately fond of grapes, and desired to preserve some, which were placed in a large vessel and lodged in a vault for future use. When the vessel was opened, the grapes had fermented : their juice, in this state, was so acid, that the king believed it must be poisonous : he had some vessels filled with it, and poison written upon each: these were placed in his room. It happened that one of his favourite ladies was affected with nervous head- achs: the pain distracted her so much, that she desired death: observing a vessel with poison written on it, she took it and swallowed its contents. The wine, for such it had become, overpowered the lady, who fell down into a sound sleep and awoke much refreshed. Delighted with the remedy, she repeated the doses so often, that the monarch's poison was all drank. He soon discovered this, and forced the lady to confess what she had done. A quantity of wine was made: and Jemsheed, and all his court, drank of the new beverage, which, from the circumstance that led to its dis covery, is to this day known in Persia by the name of zeher-e-khoosh, or the delightful poison.— M oullah A ckber's MSS. t This city is called both Istakhr and Tukht-e-Jemsheed by the Persians. 3 Harris's Travels, Vol. I. p. 570.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 17 or the Throne of Jemsheed.

The wanderings of the exiled monarch are wrought into a tale, which is among the most popular in Persian romance. His first adventure was in the neighbouring province of Seistan*, where the only daughter of the ruling prince was led, by a prophecy of her nurse, to fall in love with him, and to contract a secret marriage: but the unfortunate Jemsheed was pursued through Seistan, India, and China, by the agents of the implacable Zohauk, by whom he was at last seized, and carried before his cruel enemy like a common malefactor. Here his miseries closed: for, after enduring all that proud scorn could inflict upon fallen greatness, he was placed-f between two boards, and sawn asunderj with the bone of a fish. There are various accounts of the descent of Zohauk, who now became the sovereign of Persia. According to some historians ||, he was an Arabian, but descended from Kaiomurs: others trace his descent to Shedad, and term him a Syrian; and it has even been conjectured that he was the Nimrod of the Hebrews. All agree in one fact, that he was of a cruel and sanguinary temper. He is described as having had two dreadful cancers on his shoulders. * Called also Zabulistan, which is the ancient name of this province. f Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. % Such is the most popular account of the reign of this prince; regarding whom, however, authors differ very widely. We are told by Ferdosi, that his reign lasted seven hundred years. The same author adds, that when the news of his death reached the Court of Seistan, his distracted widow put an end to her existence with poison: but she left a son, whose descendant, Roostum, became the boast and glory of his native country. || Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 19 which the Persian fabulists have changed into snakes*, whose chap. hi. hunger nothing could appease but the brains of human beings. Two of Zohauk's subjects were slain daily to furnish the horrid meal: till the manly indignation of Kawah, a blacksmith of Isfahan, whose two sons were on the point of being sacrificed, relieved the empire from this tyrant, and raised Feridoon, a prince of the Paishdadian dynasty, to the throne.

We are told by Ferdosi, that the Devil first persuaded Zohauk to murder his virtuous father, Murdas: and afterwards tempted him to eat flesh, which was, in those days, considered a great sin. As a reward for the enjoyments he had obtained him, Satan entreated Zohauk to permit him to kiss his shoulders; which his lips no sooner touched, than a hissing serpent appeared on each. These were expected to produce his immediate death ; but the monarch was assured by the Devil, who had assumed the garb of a physician, that if the voracious serpents were fed with the brains of human beings, he need apprehend no danger. The remedy was tried, and proved successful; and Persia, but for the courage of Kawilh, would have been depopulated by this diabolical device.—F erdosi. •f- He also slew the peasant who had sheltered Feridoon in the mountains, and the cow which had nourished him with her milk.

' Be thou just and merciful, and thou shalt be a Feridoon ' The crimes of his elder sons, which embittered the latter years of Feridoon, have given rise to one of the most affecting tales in Persian romance; and it is indeed only in that form that there remains any trace of these events. This virtuous monarch had, we are told, three sons, Selm, Toor, and Erij. The two former were * Feridoon's first act was to convert the celebrated apron into the royal standard of Persia.

The princes departed for their respec tive governments; but the two elder were displeased that Persia, the Their discon- fairest of lands, and the seat of royalty, should have been given to tent ' their junior, and they combined to effect the ruin of their envied brother. They first sent|| to their father, to reproach him with his partiality and injustice, and to demand a revision of his act, threat ening an immediate attack if their request was refused. The old king was greatly distressed. He represented to them that his days were drawing to a close, and entreated that he might be allowed to depart in peace. Erij discovered what was passing, and resolved to go to his brothers and to lay his crown at their feet, rather than continue to be the cause of a dissension that afflicted his father. He prevailed upon the old king to consent to this measure, and * Her name was Irandocht, or daughter of Iran : her father was Shah-murd. t From this prince's name Persian authors derive Turan; which was formerly the appellation by which all the countries between the Jaxartes and the Oxus in one direction, and the Caspian and boundaries of China in another, were known to the natives of Persia. % Many Persian historians derive the name of Eeran from that of this prince. Moullah Firoze, an excellent Pehlivi scholar, tells me it is the plural of Eir, and means the country of believers : but Erij might have taken his name from the same term. Eeron or Aron signifies, I am told, mountainous in Hebrew; and the face of the country certainly favours this etymology. II Ferdosi.THE HISTOUY OF PERSIA. chap . in. carried a letter from their common parent to Selm and Toor; the purport of which was, a solicitation that they should live together in peace. This appeal had no effect, and the unfortunate Erij Enj is slain by was slain* by his brothers-f*; who had the barbarity to embalm his head and send it to Feridoon. The old man is said to have fainted at the sight. When he recovered, he seized with frantic grief the head of his beloved son, and, holding it in his raised hands, he called upon Heaven to punish the base perpetrators of so unnatural and cruel a deed. ' May they never more,' he * Ferdosi. f The remonstrance of Erij to his brothers, when they resolved to slay him, is given by Ferdosi in some very fine and affecting lines. He makes that prince exclaim: ' Pussundee, ou hem dastanee koonee, ' Ke jan daree, ou jan sitanee koonee: ' My azar moree, ka dana kush est: ' Ka jan darid, ou jan shereen, ou khoush est.' ' Will you ever allow it to be recorded ' That you, possessing life, deprive others of that blessing ? ' Pain not the ant that drags the grain along the ground; ' It has life, and life is sweet and delightful to all to whom it belongs.' The last couplet has been translated by Sir William Jones into English verse, and is introduced by Sadi into his epitaph on the poet by whom it was written. We are told, in a Persian work of celebrity+, that a person dreamt he saw Ferdosi composing, and an angel was guiding his pen: he looked near, and discovered that he had just written the above couplet, in which he so emphatically pleads for humanity to the smallest insect of the creation. 4 The Attash Kuddah.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 23 exclaimed, ' enjoy one bright day! may the demon Remorse tear chap. hi.

This child became the cherished hope of the aged monarch: and when the young prince attained manhood, he made every preparation to enable him to revenge the blood of Erij. Selm and Toor trembled as they saw the day of retribution approach: they sent ambassadors with rich presents to their father, and entreated that Manucheher might be sent to them, that they might stand in his presence like slaves, and wash away the remembrance of their crimes by tears of contrition. Feridoon returned their presents; and, in his reply to their message, expressed his indig nation in glowing terms. ' Tell the merciless men,' he exclaimed, ' that they shall never see Manucheher but attended by armies, and 4 4 clothed in steel J.'

When Manucheher returned in triumph, the venerable Feridoon advanced on foot to meet him: the prince dismounted when he approached, and, after kissing the ground*, received his Feridoon's congratulations. Feridoon soon afterwards died; but, before he expired, he placed his crown on the head of the grandson of Erij, advising him to attend to the council of Samf, a nobleman of great wisdom and high birth, who was hereditary Prince ofSeistan. Persian authors inform us, that Feridoon reigned five hundred years. They add, that he was the first monarch that ever rode upon an elephant, or brought those animals into use in warj. His wisdom and goodness have been universally celebrated. His testament, which was addressed to his descendants, contained the following admirable lesson to monarchs: ' Deem every day in your life as ' a leaf in your history ; take care, therefore, that nothing be ' written in it that is not worthy of posterity.'

Sam was, soon after his birth, persuaded that this infant was not his own, but that of some deev, or magician; and, under that impression, he sent it to be exposed on Elburz*, a lofty mountain, which the He is exposed Persian historian describes as ' near the sun, and far from man- tab of Eiburt ' kind.' Here fabulists relate that the young Zal was nurtured by a simurgh-f, or griffin. But Sam was soon induced to repent of his unnatural conduct; for he heard a divine voice exclaim : ' That ' infant, which a father abandoned, is now the care of the universal ' Protector J/' He went to Elburz, where he humbled hi mself before God; and his son was restored.

Supposing Sam (who is, according to Persian authors, the founder of the greatest family in their country,) the Persis of the Greeks; Zal, who was nursed by a siamurgh, a fabulous bird, was his son.

The first adventure which the poet-f* records of Zal, was that which has led to all his renown, as it made him the father of the hero of his country, the great Roostum, whose name occupies so large a space in Eastern history, or rather romance, that it must prove an excuse for the narration of those fabulous particulars which are connected with his birth. It is related that Zal, when taking the amusement of the chase, came to the foot of a tower, on one of the turrets of which he saw a young damsel, of the most exquisite beauty. They mutually gazed and loved ; but there appeared no mode of ascending the battlement. After much embarrassment J, an expedient occurred to the fair maiden : she loosened her dark and beautiful tresses, which fell in ringlets to the bottom of the tower, and enabled the enamoured prince to ascend. The lady proved to be Roudabah, the daughter of Mehrab, king of Cabul, a prince of the race of Zohauk. The love which this extraordinary interview gave rise to, ended in a marriage, which was approved both by Sam and the royal father of the princess: and we are assured all was happiness, till the pains of Roudabah threatened her husband with the loss of his beloved. The griffin, who had nurtured Zal on the mountain of Elburz, had given him, at parting, some of her feathers, and directed him to burn one whenever he was in extreme distress. He did so at this * There appears no authority from which we can conclude that the possessions of the ancient kings of Persia were ever permanently extended beyond the Indus, t Ferdosi. % Ferdosi,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ moment, and his kind nurse appeared. She told him that it was chap. hi. necessary to make an incision in the side of Roudabah, and gave him some intoxicating drugs*, which, when administered to the princess, would make her insensible to pain.

Seven nurses f were assigned for his support, but proved insufficient i and, indeed, nearly as many sheep were soon required for his daily sustenance. Such is the fabulous account of the birth of the hero of Persia. His deeds have been magnified into miracles by the poet who describes them: and his history is, in consequence, enveloped in romance. One of the principal of his achievements, during the reign of Manucheher, was the conquest of the Kullah Roostum's SuffeedJ, in the province of Pars. This fort lies about seventy-six ^Tort'of miles north-west of the City of Shiraz; is situated on a high hill, that fe e ^ IahSuf ' is almost perpendicular on every side. It is of an oblong form, and encloses a level space at the top of the mountain, which is covered with delightful verdure, and watered by numerous springs.

THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. the rude state of military science, it cannot be surprising, that the prowess of Roostum even, failed in subduing by force such a fortress. After a tedious blockade, he had recourse to stratagem. Having disguised himself as a dealer in salt, of which he knew the garrison was much in want, he put bags upon his camels, and, in place of the article in which he pretended to trade, he concealed an armed man in each bag. No suspicion was excited. The attack commenced after it was dark. The garrison, though surprised, made a desperate resistance: and it was not till daylight that Roostum obtained possession of the fort, in which he is said to have found immense treasure*.

The real cause was the distracted state of that kingdom; and the troops of Turan were encouraged as they advanced, by hearing of the death of Sam, an event from which they anticipated every success.

After the death of Nouzer, Afrasiab ruled Persia twelve years. Having seized all the chief nobles of that country, he determined to put them to death; but was diverted* from this purpose by his brother, Agrarees, who persuaded him to rest satisfied with con fining them in the fortress of Sari-f-, in Mazenderan. About this Zai marches period, Zal, the son of Sam, who commanded the army of his father-in-law, Mehrab, the King of Cabul, made head against Afrasiab, and endeavoured to gain Agrarees to his cause, by an offer (if he could effect the release of the Persian nobles) 'to raise him to the throne of Persia.

The Tartar prince agreed to the proposal; and desired Zal to send a force against him of suffi cient strength to afford him a fair pretext for retreating to defend Rhef, the seat of his government. It was at the same time settled, that a body of men should march to Sari. This plan was executed : and the small detachment that went to that city succeeded in releasing the Persian nobles.

This tremendous weapon, which had long been the terror of the enemies of his country, was soon perceived by the Tartars*; and in answer to their prince, Afrasiab, when he demanded who that boy was that made such havock in his ranks, one of them exclaimed: ' Seest ' thou not that he wields the club of the mighty Sam ? that he is ' a youth, the object of whose soul is renownf?'

A negotiation was opened, and, notwithstanding the decided oppo sition of Roostum, a peace was concluded, by which it was agreed, that the Oxus should remain, as it had been heretofore, the boundary between the two kingdoms.

They entreated Zal to hasten to court, in the expectation that he might prevail upon the king to abandon his intention^': but the sage counsels of the old minister were vain. Kai Kaoos, however, had wisdom enough to entreat Zal to govern his kingdom in his absence: but that chief would only consent to give his aid to a noble of the name of Meelad, who was appointed to the great charge, and directed not to act in any affair of importance without the concurrence of the Prince of Seistan. The King of Mazenderan, the moment he heard of the approach of Kai Kaoos, solicited aid from the Deev-Suffeed, or White Demon-f-: and their combined troops defeated Kai Kaoos in a great battle; during which, that monarch and his army were struck with a sudden blindness^; and all that were not slain, were made captives. Kai Kaoos was among the latter. He was confined in a strong fort, under the custody of a chief called Arjung, who used often tauntingly to ask the royal prisoner, what he thought of that delightful climate he had been so anxious to enjoy ||. The news of this great disaster filled Persia with dismay. Zal immediately sent his son, Roostum, to attempt the release of his king; which that hero effected through the double means of force and stratagem, though opposed, according to the fabulists of * Ferdosi. t This was probably some northern prince, whose colour and prowess had obtained him this name from his Persian eriemies. % This, as will be hereafter shown, was the eclipse, foretold by Thales, of Miletus, which occurred during the battle between Cyaxares and the Lydians^ 11 Ferdosi.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 35 Persia*, by all the efforts of valour and of enchantment.

Kai Kaoos, we are told, was vain and proud f: and he appears to have been in continual distress from the unfortunate result of schemes that his ambition led him to form, but which he wanted ability to execute. This monarch, however, is obviously thrown into these situations by the poet, that he may introduce his heroes to relieve him. His life is consequently connected with a thousand fables, which, though * improper in this place, form excellent materials for Ferdosi, who has given, in his history of this period, the extraordinary Battle between anc l affecting tale of the combat between Roostum and his andSohrab. unknown son, SohrabJ: in which, the Persian hero is described histories. And we must therefore deem that constant mention of these invasions at similar periods of the ancient history of Persia, as some proof of the general truth of the accounts we possess of these times. * He is generally termed the sovereign of Arabia: but the author of the ' Ferhung lehangheree' says he was King of Syria. •f* Ferdosi. $ The poet commences this episode with a beautiful line, that truly characterizes the story which he relates.

An event occurred during the reign of Kai Kaoos, which, as it involved the Persians and Tartars in long and bloody wars, merits ' full of the waters of the eye.'—The young Sohrab was the fruit of one of Roostum s early amours. He had left his mother, and sought fame under the banners of Afrasiab, whose armies he commanded, and soon obtained a renown beyond that of all cotem- porary heroes but his father. He had carried death and dismay into the ranks of the Persians, and had terrified the boldest warriors of that country, before Roostum encountered him, which at last that hero resolved to do, under a feigned name. They met three times. The first time they parted by mutual consent, though Sohrab had the advantage. The second the youth obtained a victory, but granted life to his unknown father. The third was fatal to Sohrab, who, when writhing in the pangs of death, warned his conqueror to shun the vengeance that is inspired by parental woes, and bade him dread the rage of the mighty Roostum, who must soon learn that he had slain his son Sohrab. These words, we are told, were as death to the aged hero; and when he recovered from a trance, he called in despair for proofs of what Sohrab had said. The afflicted and dying youth tore open his mail, and showed his father a seal which his mother had placed on his arm, when she discovered to him the secret of his birth, and bade him seek his father. The sight of his own signet rendered Roostum quite frantic: he cursed himself, attempted to put an end to his existence, and was only prevented by the efforts of his expiring son. After Sohrab's death, he burnt his tents, and all his goods, and carried the corpse to Seistan, where it was interred. The army of Turan was, agreeably to the last request of Sohrab, permitted to cross the Oxus unmolested. It was commanded by Haman ; and Zoarrah attended, on the part of Roostum, to see that this engagement was respected by the Persians. To reconcile us to the improbability of this tale, we are informed that Roostum could have no idea his son was in existence. The mother of Sohrab had written to him her child was a daughter, fearing to lose her darling infant if she revealed the truth; and Roostum, as before stated, fought under a feigned name, an usage not uncommon in the chivalrous combats of those days. In the account of this combat,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. particular notice. The Persian monarch* had married a niece-f* of Afrasiab, by whom he had a son, called Siawush, whom he intrusted to Roostum to educate. This prince is said to have been alike remarkable for his mental endowments and his personal beauty. The fair Sudaba, the daughter of the King of Hamaveran, was not restrained by her marriage with his father from becoming enamoured of Siawush. She made every effort to seduce the young prince, but in vain. Resentful of the reproach which his virtue cast upon her conduct, she accused him to Kai Kaoos of an attempt to violate her person. The old king, judging from the contrast in their appearance, the queen being dressed in a rich and voluptuous manner, and the prince in :his usual plain and unadorned attire, deemed her the tempter, and refused to listen to her complaint. The irritated Sudaba soon afterwards made another endeavour to ruin the prince, who had, she said, by his intimacy with one of his father's ladies, disgraced the Haram. From this second charge, Siawush cleared himself by passing through fire||. He not only came out unhurt from this dangerous ordeal, but had Ferdosi has even excelled himself. In the whole of this passage, there is no part more beautiful than the picture of the distraction of the mother of Sohrab, who set fire to her palace, meaning to perish in the flames, but was prevented by her attendants. These, however, could not console her. She became quite frantic : her wild joy was to clothe herself in the bloody garment in which he had been slain; to kiss the forehead of his favourite horse; to draw his bow; wield his lance, his sword, and his mace: and, at last, to use the words of the poet, ' she died, and her soul fled to that of her heroic ' son.' * Ferdosi. f This princess had fled from her native country into Persia. 1| This Custom, which still prevails with many barbarous nations, seems, at one period, to have been common in almost every country in the universe.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 39 the generosity to intercede with his father in behalf of his guilty chap. iv. accuser. 1 ^ Afrasiab, who had long threatened another invasion of Persia, was, at this period, alarmed for his own safety.

Siawxish, in a letter to his father, ascribed this act to his dread of the intrigues of his mother-in-law, Sudaba, whose active resentment, he said, rendered it impossible for him to preserve his honour and life at the Court of Persia. The self-exiled prince first married the daughter of Peeran- Wisa*, the vizier of Afrasiab; and afterwards, Feringees, the beautiful daughter of that monarch. With this princess, he received the coun tries of Cheen-f* and Khoten as a dowry. To these he retired, to await patiently the death of his father. Siawush made the City of Kung| his capital, and employed himself in improving the state of his dominions: but his success only excited the envy of several of the nobles of Tartary, and particularly of Gurseevas, the brother of Afrasiab, who incessantly endeavoured to injure Siawush, by trying to persuade his brother that the Persian prince aimed at inde pendence. Afrasiab H was alive to the feelings of honour and of hospitality, and it was long before he could be induced to lift his hand against a guest that had sought his protection. He even desired, after he believed him guilty, to allow him to depart: but * Peeran-Wisa. This chief may, with great propriety, be termed the Nestor of the Tartars. His reputation for wisdom and goodness is such, that over all Asia, those that are sage in council, are, to this day, compared by flatterers to Peeran-Wisa. t I imagine, wherever this term occurs, it means Chinese Tartary: and is here evidently used to signify a province. t The description which Ferdosi gives of the climate of this city is very happy. ' Na gurmish gurm, ou na surmaesh serd.'—« Its warmth was not heat its coolness ' was not cold.' jj Ferdosi.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 41 Gurseevas represented the impolicy of such clemency; and, indeed, chap. iv. its cruelty to the royal family of Tartary, which would, he urged, be exposed to the future attacks of a powerful monarch, who was not only thoroughly acquainted with every part of their dominions, but popular with their subjects. These arguments at last prevailed: and the brave and generous Siawush was treacherously murdered Siawush mur- by Afrasiab. Feringees, who was pregnant at this period, was ^ r b e i dbyAfra doomed to death by her father, in order to avert that vengeance which he had such just cause to dread from her offspring: but the nobles of the court combined to prevent the execution of this horrid purpose. She was delivered over to Peeran-Wisa, who, however, was directed to destroy her child the moment it was born. But the heart of the minister revolted at such an act. And when Feringees was delivered of a son, Peeran-Wisa made it over to a Binh of Kai shepherd, informing Afrasiab that he had directed it to be exposed Kh00S100 ' in a desert. He named the child Kai Khoosroo *, and took care that it should have, in a secret manner, an education suited to its high birth and future destiny. Rumours of his grandson being alive reached the ear of Afrasiab, who questioned Peeran-Wisa on the sub ject. The minister said he had heard that a shepherd had found the child, and brought it up, but that it had proved an idiot.

KaiKaooscoi- The murder of Siawush excited the most lively indignation in lects an army to revenge the Persia. Kai Kaoos collected an army to revenge the blood of his blood of his i /• i • S on. son, and sent to solicit Roostum to take the command of his troops. The only condition upon which that chief would accede to this pro posal was, the death of Sudaba, to whose wicked passion he ascribed all the misfortunes of the brave, but unfortunate Siawush. With this demand Kai Kaoos was compelled, though reluctantly, to comply-f: and Roostum marched towards the enemy. Afrasiab sent his general, Soorkhe, with thirty thousand men, to oppose him. This force was defeated by the advanced guard of the Persian army under Fera- murz, the son of Roostum. The general of the army of Tartary was slain, and his head J sent to Kai Kaoos. Afrasiab, on hearing of this event, took the field in person, and in the first battle, a celebrated Combat be- combat took place between Roostum and a hero called Peelsoom, ^mTndPed- who had overthrown two Persian chiefs H. This champion, to whom Afrasiab had promised half his dominions if victorious, was discom fited with disgrace, and thrown amid his own ranks from the point of Roostum's spear, which, however, had only pierced his girdle, as that hero, we are told, disdained the easy conquest of his life. After this combat, it was in vain that Afrasiab called upon his nobles * Ferdosi. -f Ferdosi. t This inhuman mode of treating the slain prevails to this day in Persia.

Sub- tacks R oos- turn, and is sequent to this combat, a general engagement took place, in which overcome, the Persians were victorious, and pursued their enemies nine or ten miles from the field of battle. Afrasiab, in his retreat, sent for Kai Khoosroo, and, we are told, desired to slay him: he was, however, prevented by the suggestions of Peeran-Wisa, who represented, that such an act would tarnish all the glory he had acquired, and prevailed upon him to adopt the more moderate course, of sending the royal youth beyond the sea of China*, a country from whence Kai Khoosroo he could never expect to return. Afrasiab was compelled to fly 18 anis e ' his own dominions, over which Roostum exercised sovereign sway for seven years. After that period, he committed the charge to his son, Feramurz, and returned to the Court of Kai Kaoos. We are informed, that every effort was made to discover Kai Khoosroo: and Geeve -f-, one of the most renowned of the Persian warriors, travelled over all China, defeated numerous armies, and performed a thousand wonders before he cojnpleted this great adven ture. When the young prince was at last restored to his aged Returns to the grandfather, the latter, overcome with joy, descended from his Kaoos. throne, placed Kai Khoosroo upon it, and directed all to pay him their homage.

' If the throne is resigned/' said he, ' let it ' be to a son, not to a grandson, whose blood, we must remember, ' is contaminated by having been mixed with that of Afrasiab.' This speech produced a warm altercation between Toos and Gudurz # , which was only terminated by Kai Kaoos declaring he had resolved to send his son and grandson against the deeves, (or magicians,) and that he should make him his heir, who, by his exploits, showed himself most worthy of the throne. The is crowned, result -f- was favourable to Kai Khoosroo, who was crowned when he returned victorious from an enterprise in which Feriburz had failed. Though Kai Khoosroo was now King of Persia, he paid as much attention to his grandfather as if that monarch had not resigned his power. Persian authors state, that his conduct in this, as in every other instance, gladdened the hearts of his subjects.

As Toos passed near this country, Ferood conceiving his intentions hostile, made preparations to oppose him. This induced the Persian chief to send his son and nephew to desire Ferood to wait upon him: an insulting message, that enraged the prince so much, as to make him slay the messengers. Toos J, upon hearing of this act, immediately marched against Ferood, who fell in a vain attempt to defend his castle. The Persian army advanced, but were surprised by a body of Tartars under Peeran- Wisa; and after losing great numbers, were obliged to save them selves by an ignominious flight; and their chief, in consequence of his disobedience of orders and subsequent defeat, suffered a temporary disgrace and confinement.

The fort of Killaat Is situated about thirty miles N. E. of Musched. It is upon a very high hill, only accessible by two narrow paths. An ascent of six or seven miles terminates in a plain about twelve miles in circumference, watered by several fine streams, and covered with verdure and cultivation.

The joy of Afrasiab at these suc cesses knew no bounds: he resolved upon an attack of the main body of the Persians, which was commanded by Kai Khoosroo and Roostum, who on their part adopted every means they could to repair their misfortunes. Toos was released from his confinement, and sent at the head of a fresh army to meet Peeran-Wisa, with whom he had an action which lasted for seven days, but terminated unfavourably. He was forced to retreat to the mountain of Hamavai, where his force was sur rounded and in great danger, until relieved by Roostum, who, after a number of single combats, in all of which he was successful, r k 0st t e 0 k ta i ne d a great victory, and made prisoner the Emperor of China -f-, perorofchina one of Afrasiab's chief allies. The Chinese army^, upon the occur- prisoner. rence of this event, dispersed, and Roostum immediately marched in pursuit of Afrasiab, who fled to his capital: the conquest of which was only retarded for a short time by the arrival of Pou- ladwund, the chief of Khoten, who fought with great valour, and discomfited several of the most renowned among the Persians, but was at last overthrown by Roostum.

The hero himself returned to the Court of Kai Khoosroo. CouTof Kaf Afrasiab appears soon to have recovered his kingdom; and the next enterprise of any consequence in which Roostum engaged, was the release of Beejun, the son of Geeve*, who, in consequence of a love affair with Mooneeja, the daughter of that monarch, had been made captive, and, as a punishment for his temerity, suspended * The events that led to his confinement are related in the Shah Namah nearly as follow: — One day some peasants appeared before Khoosroo, and complained that wild hogs were laying waste their cultivation, and that they would all be ruined. Beejun volunteered to go and extirpate them. On account of his extreme youth, Goorgin, a celebrated pehliva, or hero, was sent to accompany him. After they had hunted for some time, they set fire to the low wood of the forest: they then retired to a pleasant spot, where they drank and amused themselves for several days. But Goorgin having killed few hogs, and consequently acquired but a small number of tusks, resolved to lay some trap for Beejun to get him out of the way, that he might not return in disgrace to the presence of Khoosroo: and his envy was increased by Beejun's telling him that he meant to have the boars' tusks set in gold, and suspended as trophies round the neck of his charger. Goorgin now flattered the pride of Beejun by telling him, that he was the most valiant of heroes, and described a delightful valley at some distance, where Mooneja, the beautiful daughter of Afrasiab, held her court. He proposed that they should proceed to the spot, and endeavour to seize her. The youth was tempted, and his adventure ended in his being made prisoner. The description by Goorgin of this terrestrial paradise is a good example of the stlye of Persian poetry : — « Seest thou yonder valley of variegated hues. What a scene to fill the heart ' of a valiant man W1 t h joy! Behold these sweet groves, beautiful gardens, and ' flowing streams; Is it not a spot for the abode of heroes ? The ground resemblesi8 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . iv. by the heels in a pit, where his life was only preserved by the secret attentions of his mistress. The success of this enterprise would appear to have depended more on stratagem than force; the Persian hero went to the capital of Afrasiab in the disguise of a merchant. Beejun was freed from his melancholy prison; and the troops of Afrasiab that were sent in pursuit of the Per sians who had performed this service, were defeated. The young Beejun * was a great favourite of Kai Khoosroo; and that monarch, « velvet, and the air breathes perfume. You would say the rose had imparted its « sweets to the water of that rivulet. The stalk of the lily bends under the weight « of the flower, and the whole grove is charmed with the fragrance of the rose- ' bush. See how that graceful pheasant moves among the flowers, while the ' dove and the nightingale warble from the branches of the cypress. From this ' moment, till time is no more, may the borders of these banks resemble the bowers ' of Paradise! Cast your eyes on every plain and hill, and you will see cheerful « circles of sweet damsels, more blooming than the lovely fairies. Behold ' Mooneja, daughter of Afrasiab, who, like the sun, irradiates all the garden, « There too is her sister Sitara, seated like a queen, a tended by handmaids, and ' resplendent with glory. This lovely fair is the ornament of the grove: the ' rose and the jessamine yield to her in beauty. Behold also these Turkish maids, ' who have their charms veiled : Each one equals the cypress in form, and has ' ringlets like musk. Their cheeks are full of roses, their eyes of sleep ; their lips ' are vermilioned with the juice of the grape, and sweetened with the fragrant ' water of the rose. If we should only make one day's journey forwards, we shall ' reach this beautiful valley; and seizing some of these fair angels, we would carry ' the glorious prize to the royal Khoosroo.' * Kai Khoosroo, we are told, was in great distress when this hero first disappeared; and not being able to discover him by any other means, he had recourse to the Jam-e- Jehan-numai, or the mirror showing the universe, which had descended from Jemsheed, and in it he saw Beejun suspended in a pit at the capital of Afrasiab.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 49 overjoyed at the result * of this expedition, when he met Roostum, chap. iv. threw himself upon the ground, and returned thanks to the Creator of the world for the success which had attended that hero, upon whose head he placed a regal crown, as a just reward for his great exploits. m We find Roostum next engaged in a series of conflicts with his Roostum's unknown grandson, Boorzoo. This chief, who was a leader in the hrgrandlon army of Afrasiab, was the son of the unhappy Sohrab, who had B00rz00 * fallen by the sword of his father. The fate of Boorzoo might have been similar, had not an explanation taken place, which revealed his birth, and led to the establishment of friendship between him and his renowned grandfather. The despair of the Prince of Tartary at the occurrence of an event which rendered his most able leader his enemy, induced him to adopt an unworthy stratagem to delude Roostum and the chief heroes of Persia into his power. He em ployed, to effect this purpose, the wiles and beauty of a dancing girl: but the artifice had only a partial success, and ended in bringing on a general action, in which the Persians were again a general ac- victorious. Peeran-Wisa, after this battle, advised Afrasiab to IlTpersTanf retreat: but that monarch, irritated by his misfortunes, refused to arevlctonous - attend to the counsel of his wise minister, and challenged Kai Khoosroo to single combat. The Persian king, we are informed, was only withheld from accepting this challenge by the united prayers and entreaties of his warriors, who represented the mad ness of giving away the great advantages his arms had obtained, by engaging personally with a prince whom misfortune had rendered vol. i. # Ferdosi. H50 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . rv. desperate. During the conferences that took place at this period, Boorzoo advanced to meet Afrasiab, who, mad with rage at the Boorzoo ad vances against sight of an opponent that he deemed a deserter, exclaimed: — ' Vile upstart! knowest thou thy father, that thou presumest to ' enter the lists with a monarch who gave thee breadj Let Kai ' Khoosroo advance. Thy punishment shall be the wrath of God, ' which always falls upon the ungrateful/' The young warrior, enraged at these reproaches, rushed to the assault. The combat was however prevented by the advance of both armies, and the General ac- occurrence of a general action, which was only terminated by the approach of night. The troops of Afrasiab retreated; but, we may conclude, were not defeated, as they were not pursued. This battle was fought in Seistan, and Kai Khoosroo complied with the entreaty of Roostum, that he would honour his humble dwelling with his presence. The monarch was sumptuously enter tained for a week by his general; who, on this occasion, requested that he might, in consideration of his great age^, be allowed to pass the remainder of his days in retirement; while his son Feramurz, and grandson Boorzo, should serve in his place. The monarch consented, and gave the governments of Ghour and Heri t to Boorzoo, while he sent Feramurz on an expedition to Hindostan, with orders, after he had subdued that country, to co-operate with a force under Gudurz, which had been appointed to invade Tar- tary. Gudurz was opposed in this expedition by Peeran-Wisa; * Roostum is made to state that he is four hundred j^ears of age: but the poet seems reluctant to allow his great hero to quit the scene even at this advanced period of life; and he is soon brought forward again, t The ancient name of Herat.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 61 and, after some operations of little consequence, the Tartar general chap. iv. sent the following message to the Persian leader*:—' Can the 'life of Siawush, for whom so much blood has already been ' shed, be restored by the further destruction of armies?

His proposal was accepted; and ten heroes, including the two generals, were chosen from each armyf. All these combats terminated, according to Persian historians {, favourably to the champions of their country.

Unable to continue the conflict, he endeavoured to escape to some neighbouring hills; but Gudurz pursued, and, as he approached near, called to his opponent to yield, and that his life should be spared.

When he returned to camp, he was hailed with shouts of joy, and found all the other combatants had been victorious, each having slain his adversary, and dragged his body, at the tail of his horse, into the camp. The son of Gudurz was sent to bring the corpse of Peeran- Wisa, which was laid before Kai Khoosroo, who forgot the murder of his father, Siawush, in mourning over the remains of the preserver and protector of his youth. He ordered^ the body to be embalmed, and placed in a mausoleum, with the thronel}, the mace, the cap, and all the insignia of honour that were usual at the obsequies of the greatest heroes. * He had lost, as has been stated, seventy sons and grandsons in one action.

This conquests ° impatient youth, who appears to have been ill-suited to the office he filled, delivered his father's message in the most arrogant style, and finished by challenging the Persian monarch to meet him in single combat. His manner and insolence provoked Kai Khoosroo to such a degree, that it was quite impossible to prevent his accepting this challenge. They fought, and Sheydah fell. The afflicting intelli gence of his death no sooner reached Afrasiab, than he precipitated another engagement, in which his troops fought with all the courage that rage and despair could inspire: but they were defeated, and the unfortunate Afrasiab was, after some further resistance*, taken in Afrasiab is the mountains, and brought to Kai Khoosroo.

The Persians f* are too much addicted to embellishment, to permit one of their royal race to wander without adventures: and, according to popular accounts, the elegant figure of Gushtasp caused the Emperor of the West's daughter, the beautiful Kattyoon J, to neglect all the noble youth of her own country, (who had been commanded to display their figures under her balcony, in order that she might select a husband,) and to throw the orange, which marked her election, at the graceful stranger. The emperor was enraged at what he deemed her mean choice; and, though forced to comply with what had been an established usage of the empire, he abolished it from that instant, and expelled his daughter to the low dwelling of her husband. The same fable states 1|, that the emperor proclaimed that the hands of his two remaining daughters should be given to whoever slew a lion and a dragon, which were, at that period, the terror of the kingdom. Two princes, who loved the princesses, but dreaded the conflict with such monsters, applied to Gushtasp, whose fame for courage had spread around, and that hero overcame both the lion and the dragon; while the lovers, assuming the merit of these actions, married their mistresses. The emperor, we are told§, * The Persian word is Room, a term which has been adopted since the establishment of the eastern empire of the Romans.

The fame of the young prince spread to Persia: and Lohrasp, alarmed at the approach of a foreign army, headed by the heir of the throne, gave the command of his troops to his second son, Zurreer: to whom he also intrusted his crown, and directed him to place it upon the head of his brother whenever they met. Gushtasp, when the armies ap proached, did not hesitate to visit the camp of his countrymen: Returns to Persia with an he was instantly hailed as their king, and informed, by Zurreer, of army, and is the commands of his father. He wrote to the emperor he served to g entreat his presence, and assured him that every thing should be settled to his wish. The monarch came, and found his son-in-law seated on a throne, the acknowledged Sovereign of the Empire of Persia. After this interview, at which peace between the two nations was concluded, Gushtasp marched with his princess to Persia, and became a faithful servant to his father; who declared him his suc cessor, and, in a short time, gave over to him the charge of the empire; choosing to end his own days in pious retirement. It is stated by Persian authors, that this monarch sat upon the throne one hundred and twenty years*.

The following extract from the Shah-Namah, will show the feelings excited at the Court of Tartary, by this change of the national religion of Persia. ' Know ye,' (said Arjasp to his assembled chiefs,) ' that glory, wisdom, and the ' pure religion, have fled from Persia. A certain sorcerer, styling himself a prophet, ' hath appeared in that region, and introduced a new form of worship among the ' people; to whom he hath said —' I am come from above : I am come from the God ' of the world : I have seen the Lord in Heaven : and, lo! here are the Zund and the ' Osta, as written by himself. I also saw Aherman in the midst of Hell, but was ' unable to compass the circle that enclosed him. And, behold! I am deputed by the ' Almighty to preach the true faith to the king of the earth.'—And now all the ' most renowned warriors of Persia, (continued the Sovereign of China,) with the son ' of Lohrasp at their head, have fallen into his snares : the brother, too, of Gushtasp, '' that valiant cavalier and champion of Persia, Zurreer; nay, all have embraced his *' doctrines : all have wantonly sacrificed their eternal happiness to the old magician ; ' whose pernicious precepts threaten to pervade the whole world.

The Persian King was indignant at this letter, and a war immediately commenced. In the first action, which was fought in the Persian territories, the brother* of Gushtasp was killed by the sonf of Arjasp: but that young prince did not long enjoy his triumph ; he fell under the sword of Isfundear J, the son of is defeated, the Persian monarch. The battle terminated in the complete defeat of Arjasp, who fled into his own territories, isfundear re- A short period subsequent to this action, Isfundear was forced into rebellion by the intrigues of his father's court. He appears soon to have submitted, and was imprisoned: but the moment the news of his confinement reached Tartary, the monarch of that country recommenced hostilities, invaded Persia, defeated Gushtasp, and made prisoner the daughter of that monarch . After this victory, he returned to Tartary, carrying with him his royal captive and immense spoils. Gushtasp, in despair, not only gave Isfundear his liberty, but promised to resign his crown to him if he succeeded in Defeats an enterprise for the release of his sister. The prince agreed to the J P terms; collected an army, with which he defeated Arjasp, and pre pared to pursue that king to his capital of Roueendeh§. It appears there were three routes to this city from Bulkh: one four months' journey, another two months, and a third not more than six or seven days' march: but this last, we are informed^, was over a desert so * Zurreer. f Bederufsh. $ Some authorities say he was not his son, but only a great hero, of royal blood.

This, however, was the route which the enterprising Isfundear determined to take, accompanied only with sixty chosen men. He sent a chief called Pooshtung* with the army and heavy baggage by the road, which was two months' march. This officer was directed to watch, as he approached the capital of the enemy, for a signal of fire, and commanded, the moment he saw it, to lead his men to the assault. isfundear, and his sixty attendants, were habited as merchants.

A report was carefully circulated, that a great and wealthy merchant, attended by a number of friends, had escaped from the tyranny of Gushtasp. This, as was intended, soon reached 1 the ears of Arjasp, who sent for Asfundear, that he might view his merchandise. The disguised prince attended; made an offering of some rich jewels, and was assured of favour and protection. No suspicion whatever appears to have been excited: and the night of the day on which the Persian army appeared before the city, Isfun dear made the appointed signal. The troops from without instantly assaulted the town, and the prince and his companions made an attack upon the palace. The complete surprise, and consequent is sucoes&amp;fai confusion of his enemies, gave him an easy victory. When he approached the king, he exclaimed, ' You miscreant Turk-j-!

' Isfundear, Prince of Persia!' Arjasp, terrified at the name, fled, but was soon overtaken and slain: and all his brothers met the same Aijasp and all his brothers fate. The sister of Isfundear was released, and restored to her father, to whom his victorious son also sent the throne of Arjasp, and an immense booty. The government of Turan was bestowed upon a pious man, the descendant of Agrarees, whose dynasty, the author* here followed, adds, continued to rule that country till the time of Alexander. There are various accounts of the achievements of Isfundear. According to Ferdosi, after the first war with Arjasp had been brought to a favourable conclusion by the valour of that prince, he was appointed Viceroy of Bulkh, where he not only had a court, but was vested with a power over the whole empire. But this elevation only rendered his enemies more active. They persuaded Gushtasp that his son was forming designs against his life: and the prince was suddenly summoned to Persepolis, where he no sooner arrived, than he was condemned to perpetual imprisonment in a fort, in Aderbijan. This act appears not only to have revived those religious and civil disputes with which Persia was, at this period, agitated, but to have encouraged the monarch of Tartary again to invade that empire. His success was great:—Khorassan was plundered,—Bulkh was Lohrasp is taken,—the old king, Lohrasp, was included in the general massacre massacred. ^ ^ p r i es t s and followers of Zoroastcr-f-.

He was, we are informed*, chiefly induced to ^kther • come forward by his devotion to the religion of Zoroaster; and he engaged in the holy war against its enemies with all the zeal of unconquerable enthusiasm.

This remarkable usage still exists in parts of both Tartary and of India. J The huft-khan, or seven stages, by which he made his way to Roueendeh, are famous in Persian romance. The first was defended by two savage wolves: the second by two enormous lions: the third by a dragon with seven heads: the fourth by a monster called ghoul (or demon): the fifth by a griffin, or winged monster: the sixth by a perpetual fountain of immense height; and the seventh by a great lake, bounded by lofty mountains.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . iv. inhabitants; released two of his sisters, who had been taken at Bulkh • and, what was more important than all, recovered, from sacred banner, the enemies of Persia, the sacred banner of the empire, the Durufsh Kawanee* The author who relates this great conquest, gives us no particulars of the expeditions of Isfundear to India, Arabia, and the Westf, which he merely states that he conquered. We have, how ever, a romance in Persian, which is wholly dedicated to the exploits of this prince and in it there is a long but fabulous account of his western expedition. After Isfundear had subdued all the foreign enemies of his country, he expected that reward he had so long been promised —the Crown of Persia: but the artful Gushtasp, unwilling to resign power, evaded the performance of his promise. ' I should feel « ashamed,' said the crafty old monarch, ' to give, you an unsettled 44 kingdom, which mine is at present. Roostum, and his family, ' have thrown off their allegiance, and established an independance ' in Seistan. They must be reduced: and if my son effects this, ' and brings that chief bound to our presence, he shall receive the ' reward his unequalled valour merits—the sovereignty of a great ' and tranquil empireH.'

Isfundear* earnestly solicited Roostum to permit his hands to be bound, that he might satisfy his father's command : but the hero, who offered every other concession, refused to assent to an act which would bring disgrace upon his family. A battle commenced, in which several principal chiefs on both sides were slain. Isfundear engaged Roostum; and His combat with that the latter was wounded, and obliged to retire from the field : he chief, returned-f, however, next day to the combat; and on this occasion,, we are told, he had provided an arrow, formed with a double point J, to pierce the eyes of Isfundear, whose body was invulnerable, pro bably from being cased in armour|I. Before Roostum commenced the second combat, he offered all his wealth, if the possession of that would satisfy a prince, to whom he professed the most perfect allegi ance ; but Isfundear would listen to no terms, except that the hero should permit himself to be bounds and led to Gushtasp. The contest began, and continued with fury, till Roostum drew the fatal arrow. It flew with too certain an aim, and closed for ever the eyes isfundear 's of the brave prince, who exclaimed, as he writhed under the excm- deatb ' ciating wound, ' This is a just termination to the desperate and ' senseless enterprise in which the schemes of my wicked father ' have involved tne§;' Before he died, he gave over his son, * Ferdosi. t Ferdosi informs us, that he was miraculously recovered by the simurgh, or griffin; and from it he received the fatal arrow which gave him the victory in the next day's combat. % Arrows of this shape are still common in Persia.

AzerburzeenJ, the son of Feriburz, rebelled against Bahman, and recovered his patrimony of Seistan: and, if we are to believe Ferdosi, (whose partiality to Roostum extends to his grandson,) that chief slew Ardisheer. This account, however, is not confirmed by other authors. It is very marked affinity: and in the latter, Urddha-Siras means ' of exalted head.' All Persian authors term him Diraz-dust, or Long^Arms; and Ferdosi describes this deformity in one of his stanzas: ' Chu-ber-pai-hudee, ser-angoosha ' Az-zanu-fuzunter-budee-mushtee. 1 ' ' When he stood on his feet, the ends of the fingers of his hands reached below his f&lt; knee.'—This description perfectly corresponds with that of Greek authors. His name, Bah-man, is a Shanscrit compound, which signifies ' possessing arms.' * If Roostum lived to this reign, the four preceding ones must have been very short, as he bears a distinguished part in each: but the probability is, that the date of the hero's life has been prolonged by those fabulists, who have founded their fame, and that of their country, on his exploits. •f- Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh.

Though this war was at first Phlhp ' unsuccessful, the historians of Persia state, that its termination was glorious: but this is evidently the foundation of a fable, which their national vanity has led them to form, respecting the birth of Alexander J.

He built Darabjird, a town about one hundred anc l fifty miles to the east of Shiraz; which, though fallen from its former grandeur, still boasts a number of inhabitants. DaraL the Darab the Second (the celebrated Darius Codomanus of the Second. /»-r» • Greeks) was, according to the report of Persian authors, the opposite of his father. He was deformed in body and depraved in mind; and his bad administration*, if they are to be believed, completely pre pared the way for the success of Alexander. But the Persians have always had the same character: and it cannot be surprising, that a nation, distinguished for their vanity, should have given their consent to any fable, however improbable, which palliated the disgrace of the conquest of their country. It is to this feeling that we must ascribe their tales respecting the descent of Alexander. That conqueror is described as a son of Darab the First; who, aided by the Persians themselves, easily possessed himself of a crown which was his right, and which was weakly defended by his unpopular and unworthy brother. Several, however, of the most respectable Persian historians-j- reject this fable, and admit that Alexander was the son of Philip. The quarrel between the two states, we are told, originated in Alexander refusing to pay the tribute of golden eggs, to which his father had agreed.

The grain was instantly eaten up: and Alexander gave a wild melon* to the envoy, desiring him to tell his sovereign what he had heard and seen, and to give him that fruit, the taste of which would enable him to judge of the bitter lot that awaited himf. Messages of this character are not uncommon among Asiatic monarchs: and we have a popular instance^ in our own traditions, of one J which bears a very extraordinary similarity to that now related.

According to these authorities, during the heat of battle, two of the soldiers of Darab* taking advantage of his being unguarded, Darab is slain, slew him, and fled to Alexander, from whom they expected a great reward. That monarch, the moment he learnt what had happened, hastened to the spot where the Persian king had fallen. He found him in the pains of death, stretched upon the ground, and covered with dust and blood. Alexander alighted from his horse, and raised the head of his enemy upon his knees. The soul of the con queror was melted at the sight: he shed tears, and kissed the cheek of the expiring Darab; who, opening his eyes, exclaimed:— ' The world has a thousand doors, through which its tenants con- ' tinually enter, and pass away!'—' I swear to you/' said Alex ander, ' I never wished a day like this!

The History, from Persian Authorities, of Secunder Roomee, or Alexander the Great, and his immediate Successors in Persia. The different accounts which Persian authors give of Alexander's chap . v. birth, and of his conduct on that day in which Darius lost his crown and his life, have been noticed in the preceding chapter. The few remaining particulars, which are recorded in their histories, of a monarch, who conquered their country, and effected so complete a change in their government, are entitled to some attention, if it was only as a subject of curiosity. These writers state, that Philip, Kins of Macedon, was murdered; Murder of Philip. and they add, that the assassin* was impelled to the act by love for Alexander's mother-f*.

She saw her own was the common lot of humanity. His death, Alexander, according to Persian authors*, died at the City of Zour-f*; though some state that his days terminated at Babul, or Babylon. He was thirty-six years of age, and had reigned twelve years: six previous to the conquest of Persia, and six subsequent to that event. His body J was embalmed, and sent to Greece. Persian historians seldom give a character of the monarchs whose actions they relate: but the mode they have adopted, of recording * Many authors believe that he is the prophet Zulkernyn mentioned in the Koran, and that he built the celebrated rampart which confines Yajouz and Majouz. These evil demons, known to us by the name of Gog and Magog, abide, according to Persian fabulists, at the mountain of Kaf, the centre of the world : and their progeny, who are of all sizes and shapes, used to plunder and destroy the neighbouring countries ; the in habitants of which complained to Alexander, who built this wall to confine them. They scratch it almost through with their claws every day; and go home, expecting they will easily destroy in the morning the little that is left: but in the morning they find the wall rebuilt. The reason of their not effecting this object is, their never saying Inshalla, or God willing: and they never will, we are told, destroy this work, till it happens that one of their children is called Inshalla; when they will retire, calling to the boy: ' Come along Inshalla, we shall finish this task to morrow.' The accidental use of this pious expression shsiW prevent the wall being rebuilt. They will succeed in destroying it; break loose upon the world ; and their ravages will be one of many signs that will precede the dissolution of the universe. This note is taken from a Comment ary on the Koran ; and the fable probably alludes to the wall at the Straits of the Caspian, which Alexander built to prevent the destructive inroads of the Scythians into Persia. t This city is in Kurdistan.

They relate, that a chief of the Anecdotes enemy was one day brought before Alexander with his hands Xatdel bound: he ordered him to be liberated. One of his courtiers observed, 66 Were I you, I should not show such humanity to ' that man.'—' And it is because I am not you,' replied Alex ander, ' that I have pardoned him*. I freely forgive my enemies,' he added, ' because I take pleasure in exercising humanity: none in cruelty-I'. He once degraded an officer of distinction by removing him to an inferior situation to that which he had held: sometime afterwards, he asked him how he liked his new office. ' It is not the station,' replied the officer, ' which gives consequence to the man, but the man to the station. No situation can be so trifling as not to require wisdom and virtue in the performance of its duties J. The monarch was so pleased with this excellent answer, that he restored him to his former rank. The same author, who has recorded the above, informs us, that Alexander, being asked how he had been able, at so early an age, and in so short a period, to conquer such \ast regions, and establish so great a name, replied ; ' I used my enemies so well, that I compelled them to be my friends: ' and I treated my friends with such constant and extraordinary ' regard, that they became unalterably attached to my person.' # This anecdote, with a trifling variation, is given by Greek authors, t Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. ^ Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. vol. i- mTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 52 chap . v. When this great prince was asked, why he paid more honour to his master, Aristotle, than to his father: ' My father,' he replied, « brought me from heaven to earth: by the aid of my master, « I ascend from earth to heaven.' He was, the same author states, subject to violent anger; and used to warn those he loved of the danger of speaking to princes, when under the influence of passion. ' They are as a sea,' he was wont to say, ' which is ' dangerous even in a calm, but dreadful when the tempest ' rages' The life of Alexander, as given by eastern writers, contains little that can be deemed authentic: and the instances are not many in which it accords with those facts that rest upon the testimony of Grecian authors. Nothing, however, has been noticed but what the Persians consider the real history of this sovereign. They have innumerable volumes, both in prose and verse, which relate his wonderful adventures by sea and land: but these they even deem fabulous: and the character of their history of this period, is suffi cient to deter us from giving any attention to their acknowledged romances. Persian authors state, that Alexander had a son named Askan- derous, but that he did not succeed to any part of his father's power, having devoted himself to study, under the tuition of the celebrated Aristotle. We are informed by them*, that, a short period before his death, Alexander divided the provinces of Persia among the princes of that country, whom he had deposed and plundered. He restored to them their former possessions on the tenure of military service. Each * Tuarikh Muntukhub.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 83 was to maintain a fixed quota of soldiers*. But these princes, at the chap. v. death of the conqueror, threw off their obedience to his successors, and formed a feudal commonwealth of petty principalities, which, though separate, and in a great degree independent of each other, recognised some principles of common policy, that occasionally led them to unite. This community of small states existed, according to the historians of Persia, with various changes, for more than three centuries after the death of Alexander. We learn from the more authentic page of Greek writers, that after the death of Alexander, Persia fell to the share of one of his most able generals, Seleucusf, who assumed the name of Nicator, sdeucus or conqueror. This monarch, who also reigned over Syria, esta- government blished the dynasty of the Seleucides. He was succeeded by ofPersia ' Antiochus Soter; in the reign of whose successor, Antiochus is succeeded by Antiochus Theos, a tributary prince or chief of the name of Arsaces soter. revolted, slew Agathocles, the viceroy that Antiochus had left in Arsaces re- Persia, and founded, what is termed by western writers, the Parthian dynasty of the Arsacides. The foundation of this And esta- dynasty is ascribed, by eastern authors, to Ashk, a descendant n ^ t y S J t L of the former kings of Persia. This chief, we are told, obtained Arsacides * the aid of his countrymen, by informing them that he was in the possession of the sacred banner, the Durufshe Kawanee, which his uncle had saved and concealed when Darius was defeated and * This measure is stated to have been taken by the advice of Aristotle, who con sidered it impossible to deprive these princes of influence over the inhabitants of Persia; unjust to slay them; and therefore politic to give them employment, of a nature that might render them useful subjects, and prevent their being dangerous enemies. ■f He founded Antioch, SeleCicia, and several other cities.HHK THE HISTORY of PERSIA. slain*. After he had overcome and put to death the viceroy-f, whom Antiochus Theos, the third king of the Seleucides, had appointed to rule Persia. Ashk fixed his residence at Rh6; invited all the chiefs of provinces to join him in a war against the Seleucides, at the same time promising to exact no tribute, and only to deem himself the head of a confederacy of princes, formed into an union for the double object of maintaining their separate independence, and freeing Persia from a foreign yoke. Such was the commencement of that era of Persian history, which is termed, by eastern authors, the Mulook-u- Tuaif, or commonwealth of tribes. As they are, and always have been, totally unacquainted with the constitution of free states, they, no doubt, mean by this term to describe the league of petty princes among whom the empire was divided^. But the accounts we receive from Persian writers of this period, are vague and con tradictory: they have evidently no materials to form an authentic narrative : and it is too near the date at which their real history commences, to admit of their indulgence in fable. Their pretended history of the Ashkanians and Ashganians is, consequently, little more than a mere catalogue of names: and even respecting these, and the dates they assign to the different princes, hardly two authors are agreed. Ashk the First is said to have reigned fifteen years [j. Some authors ascribe the defeat and capture of Seleucus Callinicus, * Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. f Agathocles.

From the death of this prince, there appears to be a lapse of two centuries in the Persian annals of their country; for they inform us, that his successor was Baharam Gudurz: and, if this is the prince whom Baharam western writers term Gutarzes, as there is every reason to conclude it Gudurz ' is, we know, from authentic history, that he was the third prince of the second dynasty of the Arsacides: and it was he who revenged the death of John the Baptist upon the Israelites, Persian authors inform us, that Gudurz-f- was succeeded by his son, VolasJ ; from whom the crown descended to Hoormuzj], and Voias. then to his brother, Narsi. At his death, another of his brothers, Narsi. whose name was Firoze§, obtained the throne; whose successor, Firoze, Khoosroo^[, carried on a war with the Emperor Trajan, in which he Khoosroo. was unsuccessful, and lost his capital, Ctesiphon : but, at the death of Trajan, Khoosroo concluded a peace with his successor, Adrian, and * Shahpoor is, no doubt, the Artabanes of the Greeks. t They pass over his son, Vonones, who reigned for a short period. t His name is sometimes written Pollas : he was the Volageses of the Greeks, whose war with the Emperor Nero, and embassy to Vespasian, are related in the Roman history. || Hoormuz appears to have been Artabanes the Fourth of the Romans: but his brother and successor, Narsi, is not noticed, under that name, by western writers. § Probably Pacorus.

Volas and Volasin* according to Persian writers, were next in succession to Khoosroo; and Volasin left the crown to his son, Arduanf, who was engaged in a war with the Romans, before he was attacked and slain bj the celebrated Ardi- sheerj. Some Persian authors ascribe his death, and the over throw of his power, to Arduan, the son of Ashg, a lineal descendant from Kai KaoosH: who, according to those that adopt this belief, founded a dynasty, of which there were eight princes, whose aggre gate reigns occupied a period of near a century and a half. But we are told by the same author § who informs us of the rise of this family, that our Saviour was born during the reign of Khoosroo, the son and successor of Ashg, who had obtained the crown by the death of Arduan; a monarch that, we know, lived more than two centuries after that event. It would appear, therefore, that the family of the Ashganians either never existed, or were cotemporary princes with the Ashkanians. A learned and respectable oriental historian, who tries to reconcile these contradictory accounts, confesses himself completely lost in the confused and opposite statements of difterent authors. Onef, he observes, says, that Arduan, son of Ashg, who destroyed the Ashkanian dynasty, was descended from Kai^Kaoos. Another** relates, that they were of the same race as * Volas and Volasin are Vologeses the Second and Third of Roman history; the latter of whom carried on a war with the Emperor Severus, t Artabanes the Fifth. t Artaxerxes. 11 Khondemir says, that Ashg was a direct descendant of Kai Kaoos.

But this, no doubt, may be attributed to other causes than the skill and valour of the Persians. It was to the nature of their country, and their singular mode of warfare, that they owed those frequent advantages which they gained over the disciplined legions of Rome.

It consists of lofty and barren mountains, of rapid and broad streams, and of wide-spreading deserts. In whatever direction the legions of Rome advanced, the country was laid waste. The war was made, mot against the army, but the supplies by which it was supported: and the mode in which the Parthian* warrior took his unerring aim, while his horse was carrying him from his enemy, may be viewed as a personification of the system of warfare by which his nation, during this era of its history, maintained its independence. The system was suited to the soil, to the man, and to the fleet and robust animal on which he was mounted : and its success was so certain, that the bravest veterans of Rome murmured when their leaders talked of a Parthian war. * Foster deems this practice of the Parthian horsemen a confirmation of their descent from the warriors of Tartary: but the usage is, and always has been, as com mon to Persian as to Tartar tribes.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 89 CHAPTER VI.

We are informed, that this prince remained in the mountainous country about HamadanJ and Kermanshah, till he was compelled, by the success of Ardisheer, either to oppose his further progress, or to abandon his throne. He resolved to put all to the hazard of one action. The armies met in the plain of Hoormuzjl, where a desperate battle ensued, in which Arduan lost his crown and his life: and the son of Babek was hailed in the field § with the proud is hailed King of Persia. * According to some authors, two of his younger brothers were the leaders of thi conspiracy. f Istakhr appears to have been the capital of Fars-at this period.

Ardisheer took advantage of the impression this great victory had made, not only to subdue the remainder of the empire, but to enlarge its limits; which he extended, if we are to credit Persian authors, to the Euphrates f in one quarter, and the kingdom of Khaurizm, on the other. He is said to have founded a city on the banks of the Tigris; and, as the same history $ mentions that he resided at Madain, it has been supposed that he built that capital: we have, however, evidence of its existence long before his reign. But it is not improbable that Ardisheer found Madain in a state of ruin; * We are also informed, that he took the high title of Khoosroo : an august name, which, Ferdosi says, none of the rulers since Darab had ventured to assume. But the fact is otherwise; one monarch of the Parthian dynasty is only known by the name of Khoosroo, and many of the kings of that race inscribed the lofty title of King of Kings upon their coins. t Though the events recorded by Persian authors of the reign of Ardisheer are almost all confirmed by Greek writers, and the result of his war with the Emperor Alexander Severus seems to have been favourable to the Persian arms^; yet the fact of his having extended the empire to the Euphrates, is denied. It is expressly stated, that he did not recover Mesopotamia from the Romans. J Rozut-ul-Suffa. If Madain is Ctesiphon, that city had certainly been built long before. It was first a Persian camp, on the eastern banks of the Tigris, immediately opposite to the Grecian City of Seleucia, and in time rivalled and eclipsed that city. Ctesiphon was often destroyed, and rebuilt; which accounts for the variations in the descriptions which ancient authors give of this capital. One great arch, and some unshaken mounds, are all that are now left of its grandeur ; of Seleucia there is hardly a trace remaining. 5 Gibbon, Vol. I. p. 338.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. g 3 and might, therefore, from restoring it to its former grandeur, have chap. vi. some right to the title of its founder. The fame of Ardisheer spread in every direction : all the petty states, in the vicinity of his empire, proffered submission; while the greatest monarchs, of both the eastern and western hemisphere, courted his friendship, by sending to his court the most magni ficent presents, and splendid embassies. Sated with success, and a.d.240. wearied of power, he resigned the government into the hands of^pf r '® the his son, Shahpoor, after having reigned fourteen years* as absolute sovereign of Persia, subsequent to the defeat and death of Arduan. He had exercised a more limited authority twelve years before the occurrence of that event. Ardisheer Babigan (whom the Roman historians call Artaxerxes,) His character, was one of the wisest and most valiant princes that ever reigned over Persia. His life, indeed, affords the best evidence of his extra ordinary character. He raised himself, from the lowest situation, to be sovereign of a great nation, that had been in an unsettled and distracted state for several centuries. The revolution which he effected in the condition of his country was wonderful. The name of Parthia, which western writers had given to the empire of Persia, after the death of Alexander, ceased at his elevation: and the kingdom which he founded was recognised as that of Persia. His countrymen deem Ardisheer the restorer of that great empire, which had been created by Cyrus, and lost by Darius. Persian writers have preserved sayings of this prince of a character which displays both goodness and wisdom. He was * Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. wont, they state, to observe, ' That when a king is just, his sub- ' jects must love him, and continue obedient: but the worst of all ' monarchs,' he added, ' is he whom the wealthy, and not the (t wicked, dread.'-**-' There can be no power,' he remarked, ' without an army: no army without money: no money without « agriculture: and no agriculture without justice.' It was a saying of his, ' That a ferocious lion was better than an unjust king: but ' an unjust king was not so bad as a long war.' This prince often said, ' That kings should never use the sword where the cane would ' answer.' A fine lesson to despotic monarchs, whom it was meant to teach, that they should never take the life of men when the offence would admit of a less punishment. Ardisheer was not more famed for the splendour of his military achievements, than the regulations which he introduced to preserve the internal peace of his kingdom. Daily reports were made to him of what passed, not only in his capital, but in every province of his vast empire : and his knowledge upon these points extended even to the private actions of his subjects^, who, aware of his extraordinary information, regarded him with that mixed love and fear, which it was the object of his rule to inspire-f-. We are informed, however, that * Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. t We are told, that Avdisheer was learned as well as wise. He is the reputed author of two remarkable works. The first entitled, ' The Karnameh,' in which he gives an account of his travels and enterprises. The second was a work upon the best mode of living; in which rules, drawn from his own experience and judgment, were prescribed for all ranks of men. This book appears to have been greatly admired by bis countrymen : and Nousheerwan, one of the most celebrated of his successors, had many copies of it made and circulated, with a view of establishing order and morality in the empire. That learned orientalist, Mr. Richardson, informs us, that this workTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 95 Ardisheer, with all his great qualities, was a bigot: he not only chap. vi. laboured to restore the authority of the magi, but enforced, by sanguinary persecutions, a strict attention to the orthodox tenets of this religion of his country. Amid the general confusion in which the empire had been thrown, the established worship, as fixed by Zoroaster, had been neglected, and the nation was dis tracted by a thousand schisms. We, indeed, know that several of the monarchs of the Parthian dynasty inclined to the religion of the Greeks. It probably was the policy, and not the bigotry of Ardisheer, that made him desire to introduce order and uni formity in religion as well as in every other branch of his govern ment : but the strong measures he adopted to effect this object, while they have raised him to the rank of a prophet with the followers of Zoroaster, have sunk him to that of a cruel and super stitious tyrant with all who professed another belief. Ferdosi has given us the testament* of this monarch in the form of a dying charge to his son: and it is remarkable, as it exhibits his opinions upon the subject both of religion and of government. ' Never forget,' said Ardisheer, « that, as a king, you are at His dying ' once the protector of religion and of your country. Consider the hiTsl. 10 44 altar and throne as inseparable; they must always sustain each ' other. A sovereign without religion is a tyrant: and a people was written in the Deri.

The child, the infant Shah poor, was carefully reared. The minister who had ventured on this act of disobedience, afterwards revealed it to his sovereign, when he was lamenting that he had no heir. Ardisheer was overjoyed, but was desirous of trying whether he could recognise his own offspring among others of a similar age. A number of youths, among whom was the young prince, were commanded to play a match at balls before the king. In the course of the play, the ball was struck close to the throne: all the boys stood aloof, except one, (the young Shahpoor,) who went forward with confidence, and picked it up. The monarch looked anxiously at his minister; who, overjoyed at an incident that dis played such superior courage, bade him embrace his son.—This story, which I have taken from the Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh, is related by all Persian historians. * This fortress is also termed Khazm. f Juzeerah means Island, and is here applied to the countries between the Euphrates and Tigris: the Mesopotamia of the ancients. $ The famous Nisibis: a fort situated between the Tigris and Euphrates.

The first act of the pageant was, to conduct Shahpoor, by rapid marches, to Antioch, then the capital of the Roman empire in the East, which was taken, and plundered. The Persian king treated all the Roman provinces and towns which he subdued like an eastern conqueror, and destroyed what he could not hope to preserve: but his army suffered greatly in their retreat (which was encumbered with spoils and captives,) from the active valour of Odenathus, Chief of Palmyra, whose proffered friendship and splendid presents, Shahpoor, in the proud hour of victory, had treated with scorn. % The prefixed syllable, Ni, means reed; and is said to allude to those reeds found in the marsh on which this city was originally founded.

In the character which the eastern writers give of this prince, they dwell chiefly on his personal courage and boundless liberality. According to them, he only desired wealth, that he might use it for good and great purposes. Hoormuz, the son of Shahpoor, (the Hormisdas of Greek authors,) is said to have resembled, both in person and character, his grand father, Ardisheer. The mother of this monarch was the daughter of Mahrek, a petty prince, whom Ardisheer had put to death, and whose family he had persecuted, because an astrologer had predicted that a descendant Of Mahrek should attain the throne of Persia. This lady, to evade the fate of her family, had fled to the tents of a shepherd, where she was seen by Shahpoor when hunting. The prince became enamoured, and married her, but carefully concealed his having done so from Ardisheer J, who, however, going one day unexpectedly to his son's house, saw young Hoormuz. He was greatly pleased with the appearance of the child, and made inquiries, which compelled Shahpoor to confess all that had happened. The joy of the old king was excessive: « The prediction of the astro- ' logers,' he exclaimed, ' which gave me such alarm, is, thank God! ' confirmed, and a descendant of Mahrek shall succeed to my ' crown/' those reeds found , some authors ebuilt by Sbabpoor. * An account of this sculpture will be given in a subsequent chapter, t The Emperors of Rome are always termed, in Persia, the Ceesars, or Kysurs. ^ Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh.100 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. The most authentic histories* of Persia relate a very extraordinary action of Hoormuz, before that prince ascended the throne. His actrlr father, Shahpoor, had appointed him Governor of Khorassan, KhoZan. 0 ' where he had distinguished himself, not only by repelling invaders, but in preserving the internal tranquillity of that unsettled and rebellious province. This conduct, however, did not prevent some envious and designing men from exciting suspicions of his son's fidelity in the breast of Shahpoor. Hoormuz was soon made acquainted with the success of his enemies. He saw the rum that was impending; and caused one of his hands to be cut off, and sent it to his father, desiring him to accept that unquestionable mark of his devoted allegiance. Shahpoor, we are told, was struck with horror at the act which his rash suspicions had led his son to commit. He directed him to repair to court; and not only treated him with complete confidence, but loaded him with every favour that an unbounded affection could bestow. This virtuous prince only Builds the reigned one year. He founded the City of Ram-Hoormuz, where Hoormuz Ram ' they show an orange tree-f which he is believed to have planted, and which is on that account still venerated by the inhabitants. a. d. 272. Baharam, the son of Hoormuz, succeeded that monarch. He cetdTToTe was a mild and munificent prince, and much loved by his subjects, throne - w hom he ruled with moderation and justice. The most remarkable act of his reign was, the execution of the celebrated Mani, the founder of the sect of the Manichaeans, and the author, if we believe eastern historians, of a book called Ertang, which he pre tended was divine, and in which he endeavoured to reconcile the * Rozut-ul-Suffa and Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh, f Moullah-Saaduck's MSS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 10] doctrines of the Metempsychoses as taught by the Hindoos, and the chap, vi. two principles of good and evil of Zoroaster, with the tenets of the Christian religion*. Among many of the followers of the latter faith, a belief was entertained of the early fulfilment of the promise which Christ had made, to send a comforter after him. To gain these, Mani boldly declared himself the Paraclete. He appears to have trusted chiefly to his pencil for success: and his pain tings f were deemed miraculous in countries where that art was hardly known. This bold impostor made many converts, but was forced by Shah- poor to fly from Persia, whence he went to Tartary and China}, and did not return till the reign of Baharam. That prince at first showed a disposition to embrace his faith; though most authors con tend this was a mere pretext, to lull Mani and his followers into a fatal security. The result was of a nature to confirm this opinion : Mani, and almost all his disciples, were put to death by order Qfp u ts Mani, Baharam; and the skin of the impostor was stripped off, and hung}| ^ up at the gate of the City of Shahpoor§. Baharam only reigned death - ' three years and three months; during which, Persia enjoyed perfect tranquillity. * Sir William Jones inadvertently adds, ' with several tenets of the Koran but as Mani lived many years before Mahomed, he could not have borrowed from that volume.—See Sir W. Jones's Works, Vol. VI. p. 601. f To add to the effect of his doctrines and paintings, he withdrew for a period from the world, and concealed himself in a cavern while he finished those works, which, on his reappearance, he declared had descended to him from Heaven. t According to some authors, he also visited India.

They agreed to his proposal; and, in conformity with his advice, they absented themselves from court. The king wandered through his palace alone: he saw no one: all was silence around. He became alarmed and distressedf. At last the chief pontiff appeared, and bowed his head in apparent misery, but spoke not a word. The king entreated him to declare what had happened. The virtuous man boldly explained what had passed ; and conjured Baharam, in the name of his glorious ancestors, to change his conduct, and to save himself from destruction. The king was much moved, professed himself most penitent; and added, that he was resolved his future life should prove the sincerity of his present sentiment. The overjoyed high priest, delighted at the success of his scheme, made a signal, at which all the nobles and attendants were, in an instant, (as if by magic,) in their usual places. The monarch perceived from this, that only one opinion prevailed on his past conduct. He repeated, therefore, to his nobles all he had said to the chief pontiff, and his future reign was unstained by cruelty or oppression. But the reform of the monarch did not preserve his a. d . 283. country from the miseries that were produced by his weakness.

After a reign of nine years*, he abdi cated the throne in favour of his son, Hoormuz; and survived that act but a very short period. We meet, in the page of western writers, with a fuller narrative of the reign of Narsif; a prince who subdued almost all Armenia^, and Defeats the from whom the Emperor Galerius suffered a signal defeat on the same feZr^' field which had been so fatal to Crassusjl and his legions. Though a. d . 296. Persian historians are general and indistinct in their relation of the events of this period, we can hardly account for the omission of an event so gratifying to their national pride; but they were, perhaps, withheld from recounting his victories from a desire to avoid the mention of his subsequent discomfiture; for Narsi did not long enjoy a.d.297. his success. The Romans advanced next year into Persia; and their emperor, taught by experience, left the plains of Mesopotamia on the right, and carried his forces^ through the mountains of Armenia, which were more favourable for the operations of infantry, in which the strength of his army chiefly consisted. In this second * Tuarikh Muajem. The Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh states, that this prince reigned four teen years.

The great province of Mesopo- ^^ s n g - rea ' tamia (or the Juzeerah) was ceded to the Romans. Five districts to the eastward of the Tigris were also given to that nation. This last cession included the greatest part of Carduchia, the modern Kurdistan; a country more fruitful in soldiers than in grain: but which, from its strength and position*, commanded all the western part of Persia. The five districts ceded to the Roman emperor, had before belonged to the kingdom of Armenia; and, as the war had been undertaken by Galerius in defence of Teridates-f, the ruler of that country, the fine province of Atropatene (the modern Aderbijan) was extorted from Narsi, as a compensation to the Armenian prince for that part of his inheritance which had been made over to the Romans.

The next process was to crown the expected sovereign of Persia; which was done by suspending the royal tiara over the invisible head of the unborn monarch, who received, in this state, the daily obei- BirthofShah- sance of his court. When the child was brought forth, it was, by poor the Se- . r. i i i i cn i cond. the unanimous voice of the nobles, named Ibhahpoor; and every care was taken to give the young sovereign an education suited to his high duties. The whole nation appear to have taken the most affectionate interest in his progress to manhood; and the early indications of sense and spirit that Shahpoor displayed, spread an universal joy over the kingdom-f*.

The manner of his chastisement of these tribes, is perpetuated in his title of Zoo- laktaf*, or the Lord of the Shoulders; which originated from his having directed the shoulders of the captives to be pierced, and then dislocated by means of a string that was passed through them. Shahpoor meant, by this cruel punishment, to strike terror into the Arabs, and to revisit upon them the horrid atrocities which they had committed in Persia. Eastern historians have decorated the life of Shahpoor with fables, which appear more extravagant from being wholly unne cessary to his glory. That, as far as it depended upon his success against the Romans, would have been sufficiently confirmed by a plain and true narrative of the actual events of his long and splendid reign. But, while the most important of these are passed over in silence, or noticed in a very general manner, they dwell upon a strange and improbable tale, which represents this proud and powerful monarch as leaving his kingdom to become a spy : as shahpoor being taken at a royal feast at Constantinople, from the resemblance spy^Td ^ which he bore to his picture in the possession of the emperor: suffer- ^ntintp^e'' ing, while a captive, every degradation that could be inflicted: and * It is also written Zaulachtaf. Eastern authors are agreed with respect to the origin of this title. Gibbon confounds the irruption of the Arab tribes with an attack made by a chief of the Juzeerah, called Tayer, who made prisoner a sister, or female relation, of Shahpoor: and tells us, that after conquering this prince, he treated him with such humanity, that he was called Dhoulacnaf, or Protector of the Arab nation.

These fables refer to the general success of the Persians during the reign of the Emperor Constantius; and their authors inform us, that, after the return of the Roman emperor to his own territories, a person descended from the great Constantine took possession of his The Romans throne, and assembled a numerous army to attack Persia. The T d ^?* Arab tribes, they add, who were eager for revenge, readily joined the Romans; and their united force amounted to one hundred and seventy thousand menf. Shahpoor declined meeting this formidable army at the frontiers, being sensible, that if he suffered a defeat, which their overwhelming numbers rendered probable, he should be ruined. He retreated to one of the interior provinces; and, collecting all the force he could, he advanced to give battle.

The alarmed Emperor of Constantinople agreed to the terms prescribed: and the famous Who delivers City of Nisibis* was delivered over to Shahpoor, who immediately ofNistbis City sent a colony of twelve thousand men, drawn from Fars and Irak, to inhabit it, and to cultivate the lands in its vicinityf. Such is the account which Persian authors give of the expedition of the celebrated Roman emperor, Julian. The great victory which they ascribe to that sovereign, must allude to his passage of the Tigris, and the action which he fought near the walls of Ctesiphon. They state, with fairness and truth, the conduct which Shahpoor adopted. The usual process of laying waste the country, and harassing the enemy by predatory attacks, was resorted to with success. The retreat of Julian is mentioned, but not his death : but this silence may be easily accounted for. It might be deemed a diminution of the glory of Shahpoor, to refer the great triumph he obtained to any cause but his own wisdom and valour. A D 381 The reign of Shahpoor was, according to some Persian historiansj, His death. a f ew months longer than his life; and he died at seventy-one years of age. Others state that he was not crowned till he was born, and that the crown was then suspended over his infant head. This differ ence is of little consequence: for there can be no difficulty in giving * By the ignominious treaty of Dura, which is that to which the Persian author alludes; and which was concluded by the Emperor Jovian, after the death of Julian. The five provinces to the east of the Tigris, which Narsi had granted to the Romans, were restored. Nisihis, which had often resisted his arms, was given up, and its inha bitants forced to remove from the city and its surrounding country, to make way for a Persian colony. The greater part of Mesopotamia became a province of Persia. The Prince of Armenia was abandoned: and almost all the advantages obtained from the victory of Galerius, and the peace concluded by that emperor and Diocletian, were relinquished. i' Rozut-ul-Suffa.

Those loyal and virtuous considerations chap , vr. which ]ed the nobles of Persia to preserve their country from the troubles of a disputed succession, must have induced them to give their resolution all the impression that it could receive from the strictest observance of outward forms: and when we consider their conduct in this light, their obedience to the unborn Shahpoor, (after their priests had satisfied them that the embryo would be a male,) appears as rational and praiseworthy as if granted to an infant. The same wisdom which led them to preserve the crown for Shahpoor, prompted them to give him an education worthy of his elevated rank: and no history affords an example of loyal care better rewarded. Shahpoor seems to have been all that his subjects could Government desire. During his long reign, he raised his country to a state and character ' of the greatest prosperity; having defeated all his enemies, and extended the limits of the empire in evety direction. His suc cess against the Romans forms that part of his history of which his countrymen are with justice most proud. He not only obtained possession of the impregnable Nisibis, and recovered a great part of Mesopotamia and the five provinces on the western frontier of Persia, that his ancestors had lost; but he reduced the country of Armenia, from an independant principality, (which had always been supported by the Roman emperors,) to be a province of his empire. In effecting the latter object, he is accused of having had recourse to treachery *: but this, even if true, would tend little to diminish his glory with his own subjects or their posterity. * He is said to have persuaded Tiranus, the King of Armenia, to come to his court; to have seized him at a festival; and to have thrown him into a dungeon, where his life soon terminated.—G ibbon , Vol. IV. page 3] 2.112 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. Shahpoor appears to have been a prince alike remarkable for wisdom, valour, and military conduct. Some of his observations have been preserved, that show great knowledge of the human mind.

But this descentt a. d. 381. n j is at variance with those extraordinary facts relative to Shahpoor's succession, in which all eastern historians are agreed. Ardisheer sat upon the throne of Persia only four years; during which A.D.sss. period no event of consequence occurred. He was deposed by slahpoofthe Shahpoor 11, the son of Shahpoor-Zoolactaf.

J The author of the Tuarikh Tubree gives countenance to this descent of Ardisheer; but reconciles it with the undisputed facts connected with Shahpoor's elevation, by stating, that Hoormuz disinherited Ardisheer, who Was his first born, in favour of the unborn Shahpoor, and the nobles attended to his will. But this is an improbable fable. Other authors say, Ardisheer was an uterine brother of Shahpoor the Second; and that he was never raised to the throne of Persia, but was regent of the kingdom till his nephew came of age 11 Sapor the Third of Roman historians.

One writer H informs us, that it was a solitary instance of the wisdom of the Emperor Arcadius to leave Yezdijird the protector of his infant son, Theodosius; and that the royal guardian executed his trust with unexampled fidelity. The truth of this remarkable fact is not denied by a Christian writer; who, at the same time, deems it a crime in Arcadius to have com mitted such a charge to a stranger, a rival, and a heathen. But we are told by the able historian § who records this extraordinary tradi tion, that it is not confirmed by other writers, and consequently not deemed worthy of credit.

But even those have pre- served some of his sayings, which breathe a spirit that contradicts the character that they have given of him. Yezdijird, they inform us, often remarked, ' That the most wise of monarchs was he who ' never punished when in rage, and who followed the first impulse ' of his mind to reward the deserving.' He used also to observe, ' That whenever a king ceased to do good actions, he necessarily ' committed bad; and that the thoughts of eternity could not, for ' a moment, be absent from the mind without its verging towards ' sin.' At the death of Yezdijird, there would appear to have been some a. d. 420. obstacles to the succession of Baharam. The luxurious nobles of the ine succession Court of Madain dreaded a monarch who had been educated among ° h f e B F ^ am Arabs; and who might, they conceived, have acquired habits opposite to those of his country : and, under this impression, they actually raised another princef of the royal family to the throne: but this Another proceeding only afforded to the true heir an opportunity of showing prince raised - his courage J and magnanimity; and Baharam obtained his right almost without a struggle. * I have repeatedly stated, that the first historians, or rather preservers of tradi tions, in ancient Persia, as in all other rude states, were the priesthood of the country: and we must peruse their accounts with allowance for those prejudices which their occupation was likely to inspire. f His name was Khoosroo. % According to Persian historians, or rather fabulists, he advanced into Persia with a large army of Arabs; but, to save the blood of his countrymen, he proposed, that the crown of Persia should be placed between two furious lions, and that it should be given to the prince who had the courage to attack such guards.

His generosity was not limited to his court or capital, but extended over all his domi nions : no merit went unrewarded: and it is related, that his and liberality, liberality was so unbounded, that his ministers, who dreaded the effects of its excess, presented a memorial to him, which pointed out how essential the possession of treasure was to support the dignity and the power of a monarch. Baharam wrote, under this representa tion : ' If I am not to employ benefits and rewards to gain the ' hearts of free men who render me their obedience, let those who 44 framed this memorial inform me, what means I am to use, to attach ' such persons to my governmentf.' It was under this sovereign, whose reign spread joy over Persia, that minstrels and musicians were first introduced into that kingdom. Baharam, we are toldj, observed a merry troop of his subjects dancing without music: he achievement: but the situation in which he saw the crown placed had deprived it of all its attractions in the eyes of that prince, and he declined the attempt. Baharam instantly flew at the lions; and, though almost unarmed, soon slew both, and seized the crown, amid the shouts of his subjects. * Varanes the Fifth of Roman history.

The king sent to India for musicians and singers; and twelve thousand were encouraged, by his munificence, to enter his dominions. It appears that an impression was received among foreign powers, from the conduct of Baharam in this and similar instances, that not only the king, but his subjects, were immersed in luxury; and that the love of the dance and the song had superseded that martial spirit, which had so lately rendered Persia the terror of sur rounding nations. The Khan of the tribes of Transoxania was the The Khan first who presumed to act upon this impression: he crossed the Oxus La iTadea at the head of twenty-five thousand men-f, and laid waste the whole Persia ' of Khorassan. This invasion spread a dismay, which was greatly increased by the disappearance of Baharam, who, it was immediately concluded, had fled, from a sense of his inability to meet the impend ing storm. The result was, the universal terror of the Persians, and the unguarded confidence of the Tartars, whose sovereign thought the war was over, and that he had only to receive the submission of the Persian chiefs, who daily crowded to his standard and implored Baharam 1 . t &gt; i • t n makes a sud- his favour and protection.

The slaughter was great; and the chief of the enemy fell under the sword of Baharam, who pursued the fugitives across the OxusJ. The use he made of this great victory, Was to establish peace with all his neighbours||; and, after this was concluded, he returned to his capital. Persian historians recount a long fable respecting the adventures of Baharam in India: to which country, we are told, he travelled in disguise, leaving his government under the rule of his wise minister, Meher-Narsi: but such extravagant tales hardly deserve to be noticed. After his return from India, he was, according to the same authorities, very successful in some incursions which he made into the Arabian * Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. f Some authors state the numbers with the king as much fewer. I have followed the most probable account. X The account of this glorious exploit of Baharam, is differently related by eastern historians. According to one, he did not conceal himself; but, making over the king dom to his brother, Narsi, marched towards Aderbijan with a small body: a measure that persuaded the Tartars, and his own subjects, that he had fled. He afterwards returned, to surprise the enemy, by secret roads. If we believe some authors, this action did not take place in Khorassan, but at Rh^. These are immaterial points. The substance of what has been stated, is confirmed by every Persian historian. 11 He is said to have erected a column on the banks of the Oxus, to mark the boundary of the Persian empire.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ and Roman territories : and these flatterers assert, that he carried his chap . vr. arms to the vicinity of Constantinople: but we know that the contest between Baharam and the Emperor Theodosius was attended with no success of any consequence to either party. It ended in a truce for one hundred years. This war, we are informed by the eloquent historian of the Roman empire*, « though only remark- ' able for failures, and alike inglorious to the arms of both the « Romans and Persians, was immortalized by the conduct of Conduct « Acacius, Bishop of Amida. That truly Christian prelate boldly ' declaring, that vases of gold and silver were useless to a God who Amida ' ' neither eats nor drinks, sold the plate of his church, employed the ' money it produced in the redemption of seven thousand Persian &lt;c captives, supplied their wants with affectionate liberality, and dis- « missed them to their native country, to inform Baharam of the ' true spirit of that religion which he persecuted/' The ruling passion of Baharam was the love of the chase.

Baharam, proud of his excellence as an archer, wished to exhibit before one of his favourite ladies. He carried her to the plain, and an antelope was soon found, asleep.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. Shiraz and Isfahan, which is, to this day, called the vale of heroes; from being, (on account of its fine pasture and abundance of game,) the favourite resort, from the earliest ages, of the kings and nobles of Persia. The whole of this valley abounds in springs; some of which are very large, and of great depth: their sources under ground are supposed to communicate. It is not surprising, therefore, that the The monarch shot an arrow with such precision, as to graze its ear. The animal awoke, and put his hind hoof to the ear, to strike off the fly, by which he conceived himself annoyed. Another arrow from the royal how fixed his hoof to his horn. The exulting Baharam turned to the lady, in the expectation of her warm praises: she coolly observed, Neeko kurden z pur kurden est ; that is, ' Practice makes perfect. Enraged at this uncourtly observation, the king instantly ordered her to be sent into the mountains to perish.' Her life was saved by the mercy of a minister, who allowed her to retire to a small village, on the side of a hill. She there lodged in an upper room, to which she ascended by twenty steps. Immediately after her arrival, she bought a small calf, which she regularly carried once up and down the flight every day. This exercise she continued four years; and the improvement of her strength kept pace with the increasing weight of the animal. Baharam, who had supposed his favourite dead, happened, after a fatiguing chase, to stop one evening at this village. He saw a young woman carrying a large cow up a flight of twenty steps. He was astonished, and sent to inquire, how strength so extraordinary had been acquired by a person of so apparently delicate a form. The lady said, she would communicate her secret to none but Baharam; and to him, only on his condescending to come alone to her house. The monarch instantly went; and on his repeating his admiration at what he had seen, she bid him not lavish praises where they were not due: ' Practice makes perfect, said the lady, in her natural voice, and at the same time lifted her veil. The monarch recognised, and embraced his favourite. Pleased with the lesson she had given him, and delighted with that love which had led her to pass four years in an endeavour to regain his esteem ; he ordered a palace to be built on the spot, to serve as a hunting- seat, and a commemoration of this event.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 121 body of Baharam was never found, though every search* was made chap, vl for it by his inconsolable mother. Baharam-Gour was certainly one of the best monarchs that ever His govern- ruled Persia. During the whole of his reign, the happiness of his racter! ndCha ' subjects was his sole object. An anecdote is related of him, which shows at once his intimate knowledge of human nature, and the regard he paid to the feelings of every class of men in his dominions. He had a son who was considered an idiot-f: it was in vain that the best masters endeavoured to instruct him : he appeared incapable of receiving theit lessons: and hardly a hope was cherished of his im provement. One day his tutor told Baharam, that it was with grief he had discovered that the young prince added vice to his stupidity: ' I have detected him,' he said, ' in an endeavour to seduce the ' beautiful daughter of a poor man who dwells in the vicinity of his ' palace.' The king's countenance beamed with joy at the intelli gence. ' Thank God the clay is kindled!' said the monarch to himself. He immediately sent for the father of the girl, and addressed him in the following terms: ' I wish not to trifle with ' your honour, or with that of any man in my kingdom; but your ' daughter may become the instrument of a nation's happiness. My ' son loves her, and her power over him is therefore unbounded; bid ' her use it to awaken in him the desire of attaining perfection, to * When encamped, in 1810, near the springs, into one of which Baharam had plunged, being aware of their dangerous nature, I directed that none of my escort should bathe. This order was unfortunately disobeyed by a young man of the 17th dragoons; and though reported a good swimmer, he was drowned: his body was recovered, being near the edge. The spring in which he lost his life, we were told, was the same into which Baharam had fallen. f Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. vol. i. rm THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. ' please her: she may, without danger to herself, give him sufficient « encouragement to keep hope alive, and love will do all the rest.' The old man promised to lesson his daughter, who played her part to admiration: and the enamoured prince soon became all that his father or the nation could wish ; and was as remarkable for his spirit and intelligence, as he had been before for his dulness and insensibility*. Baharam ruled Persia eighteen years. He seems through life to have preserved the virtues and habits that were early impressed upon his mind by the precepts and example of the Arabian chief by whom he was educatedf. His government was more simple and patriarchal than that of any monarch of Persia. He was, like a true Arab, enthusiastically devoted to the chase, and delighted in a wandering life: and it was this disposition that has given rise to the romance of his visit to India, which would appear an altogether improbable fable J. Yezdijird the Baharam was succeeded by his son, Yezdijird the Second j], a a. d . 438. wise and brave prince, who took the best means of maintaining the prosperity of his empire, by cherishing the favourite ministers and officers of his father. During his whole reign, which was eighteen years, Persian historians only notice one war in which he was engaged with the Romans.

This prince is distinguished from others of the same name by his title of Sipahdost, or the Friend of the Soldier; a term which sufficiently describes the impression entertained of his character. Hoormuz, the younger son of Yezdijird, succeeded his father, of is succeeded ii i i ^ • tt - ^ Hoormuz. whom he was always the favourite. His elder brother, Firoze, had a. d. 456. been appointed to the charge of a distant government, with a view of facilitating the project formed by Yezdijird, of leaving the succes sion to Hoormuz, who, at his father's death, was supported by the principal lords of the empire: but his brother, though at first com pelled to fly across the Oxus, soon returned to assert his right at the head of a large army, formed of the warlike tribes of that quarter. Before the result of this contest, and the events to which it gave Account of rise, are related, it will be useful to say a few words regarding the o'TTartalT' 8 name and character of those tribes who inhabited, at this period, that great track of country which lies between the Oxus and Jaxartes. These received from the ancients the general name of Scythians, and are now known to Europeans under that of Tartarsf. Though this country has been subject to a succession of warlike tribes, these have probably all been derived from one stock: for though known under many names, their habits and character have always been the same. ♦ Western writers do not notice this event; and the fact is not likely to be correct. t This term is derived from Tatar, the name of a tribe; who, we are told by Abdul Ghazi, consisted of seventy thousand families.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. The Scythians of the Greeks differ in no essential degree from the Tartars of modern history. Before the time of Alexander, Transox- ania was inhabited by a nation known by the generic name of Sacas: and the Getse and Massagetae* were powerful tribes of that nation. The appellation given in the history of ancient Persia to the country between the Oxus and Jaxartes is Turan; but oriental authors give us no names of particular tribes at this period of their history: and all those who dwelt beyond the limits of Turan, to the east and north east, were considered as belonging to Chin and Khatai: which countries, in their page, may be generally understood to designate that large tract which is known in modern geography as Chinese Tartary. We learn from every history, that from the most early ages to the present, the Nomades or pastoral tribes of this country have been continually changing : they have, in their turn, subdued others, and been conquered themselves. We find them sometimes improving and extending their dominions : and, at others, compelled to leave their pasture lands to the occupation of fiercer and more numerous hordes of barbarians; and forming, as they proceeded into the fertile plains of southern Asia, or of Europe, part of that great tide of violence and of rapine-f*, which, rising near the Frozen Ocean of the North, rolled, before its destructive waves subsided, to the furthest * The celebrated Afrasiab was probably the monarch of these tribes, t The progress of the Tartar hordes is finely described in Scripture, Ezekiel, when prophesying of Gog and his people, says :—• ' Thou shalt ascend, and comeJike a storm ^ thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the ' land; thou, and all thy bands, and many people, with thee. ' And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go toTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 125 bounds of the Indian Ocean, and the remotest shores of the chap. vi. Atlantic. But this picture, however just, of a part of the inhabitants of Tartarj, could never have applied to the whole. It describes the progress of great tribes who occupied the plains, and in their turns gave sovereigns to this vast country. There can, however, be no doubt that many races of men, unable to defend the level country against invaders, took refuge in those lofty and inaccessible moun tains with which Tartary is every where intersected: and some of these have continued for generations to maintain inviolate their original language and usages*. Other inhabitants of this great region, devoted to the peaceful arts of husbandry and trade, must have been preserved, by the character of their occupations, from those violent changes to which the martial tribes were exposed: and the modern distinction of Turk and Taujeck, which, in its literal meaning, denotes men of military and of civil pursuits, has, we may safely con clude, existed from the most early ages in this extended country. ' them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and hav- ' ing neither bars nor gates. ' And thou shalt come from thy place, out of the north parts, thou, and many ' people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty « array.' * The researches of Russian travellers have discovered many of these races, who are quite distinct in their manners from the modern Tartars and Turks, and who have also different languages. Ignorance delights in general description: but such, when applied to a vast empire, can never be true. It is a common fault of historians, to be desirous of giving, on all occasions, a finished picture of the nations of whom they treat: but such descriptions must, in many cases, be like finished maps of unsurveyed regions, which are only calculated to mislead.126 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. We are informed by the historians of Europe, that the White Huns, who were called Hiatilla, but who were a tribe of Tartars that issued The Hiatilla. from plains near the north wall of . China, made themselves masters of the country of Transoxania about the time of which we are writing. It is remarkable, that some of the most respectable oriental authors discontinue, at this period of history, to use the expression Turan in describing this country. They now term it Turkestan, and call its inhabitants Turks: and they describe this race sometimes as coming from beyond the Jaxartes; and at others, from China. But the oriental historians who write of ancient Persia, though often correct in general facts, have as little minute knowledge of dates as they have of geography; and they have, in this place, evidently antici pated the irruption of those Turkish tribes, who some years after wards expelled the Hiatilla, or White Huns, from the lands that they had taken from the Sacaes, or Scythians. There is every ground to conclude, that it was an army of the Hiatilla that invaded Persia in the reign of Baharam-Gour: and it was to one of their Firoze flies kings that Firoze fled, to escape the effects of that combination, to Khoosh- i • i i • t Nuaz, King which his brother and the chief nobles had entered into, to exclude y him from the throne. The name of this prince was, according to some Mahomedan authors, Khoosh-Nuaz: but this appellation, which may be interpreted, ' The Bountiful Monarch,' was probably only given to denote the kindness and liberality of this prince. Ferdosi calls him Paganish and Khakan. The latter is the title that has been assumed by the sovereigns of the great tribes of Turks, who afterwards expelled the Hiatilla, or Huns, from Transoxania.

Other his torians, more favourable to Firoze, state, that, after putting to death Hoormuz, and some officers of rank, (acts essential to secure the throne,) he showed great clemency and justice; and that, during the dreadful famine that ensued, it was solely by his parental care of his subjects, that they were saved from total destruction ; for, according to the same writers, his pious and incessant prayers had the effect of producing that rain which restored abundance to his exhausted kingdom. But it is from their actions that we must form our opinions of the characters of Asiatic princes : and those of Firoze are not of a nature that can lead us to credit such partial accounts. The great object of his life appears to have been to destroy the power of the generous monarch, to whom he owed his throne.

Khoosh-Nuaz, too weak to oppose the Persian army, retreated as it advanced; but he was soon enabled, by the noble devotion of one of his chief officers, not only to preserve his country, but to retaliate upon his enemies that ruin with which he was threatened. This officer entreated his prince, after communicating the plan he had formed, to order some of his limbs to be cut off, and his body to be otherwise mangled*, and then cast in a part of the road where he was likely to be found by the soldiers of the Persian army. This was done: he was taken up and carried to Firoze. ' Who has reduced you to this sad condition?' said the king. ' That cruel tyrant, Khoosh-Nuaz,' was the answer. ' And ' for what ?'—' Because I took the liberty that belonged to an old 44 and faithful servant, to represent the consequences of his bad ' government, and to tell him how unequal he was to meet the ' valiant troops of Persia, conducted by such a hero as Firoze.

The greatest part of the army of Firoze perished in this desert; and that prince was only permitted to return with the survivors through the clemency of Khoosh-Nuaz, to whom he sent to solicit peace*. The Tartar monarch gave the following answer to his solicitations: ' After I had loaded you with favours and benefits: ' after I had furnished you with money and troops, to establish ' you upon the throne of your father, you have, in gratitude ' for such great obligations, collected an army, at the instance ' of the most vile and despicable of men, and advanced into my ' territories, for the purpose of destroying me.

Firoze was in no condition to refuse this offer: he took the most solemn oaths: and was not only permitted to return, but received every favour and attention in the power of his noble enemy to bestow. But the mind of Firoze was tormented by the recollection of the degradation he had suffered. The humanity and generosity of his enemy were hateful, as they made his own conduct appear more base, and inexcusable. Tortured by such reflections, he desired to wipe away what he deemed his disgrace, by the ruin of his benefactor. * Zeenut-ul-Tuarikb. vol. i. t Rozut-ul-Suffa.130 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. In defiance of the council of all the good men of his court, and of the remonstrances of the priests, who entreated him to think on the impiety of breaking his oath, he collected an army, delivered over his kingdom to a noble of the name of Sukhvar, and once more Crosses the crossed the Oxus, resolved to conquer or to perish. Khoosh-Nuaz Khoosh-NuaL awaited his approach. He had directed that a long and deep trench should be cut in the rear of his army, over which two or three con cealed pathways were left: and these, with the other parts of the trench, were covered with light broken twigs and earth, so as to resemble the plain. The Tartar prince, when Firoze advanced, pre sented, on the point of his lance, the treaty to which he had sworn; and exhorted the Persian monarch yet to desist, before he had destroyed his fame for ever. Firoze, who thought this attempt to obtain peace proceeded from fear, instantly rushed to the attack. The troops of Khoosh-Nuaz turned their backs before their enemies reached them, and fled with a rapidity which increased the ardour and courage of the Persians: but the columns of the flying army were carefully led over the few paths that had been left over the deep trench, which received their heedless pursuers.

We are told, that, as this prince passed Nisha- pore, he spent one night with a beautiful young lady of that city, who, when he returned four years afterwards, accompanied by a large army, (with which the Khakan-f* had furnished him,) presented him with a fine boy, the fruit of their casual amour. He was Birth of Nou- delighted with the appearance of the child ; and, as he was con- sheerwm ' templating him, he received accounts, that his brother, Pallas, was no more, and that the crown of Persia awaited his acceptance. This intelligence reaching him at such a moment, made the superstitious prince conclude, that fortune already smiled on his son, whom he, from that day, treated with the greatest favour and distinction. He gave the infant prince the name of Nousheerwan : and, in this case, * The Valens of Roman history. This is the same name which occurs in the Par thian dynasty, and is called Vologeses by the Roman historians. This prince lived in the reign of the Emperor Zeno. f This Khakan was the same Khoosh-Nuaz to whom Firoze had fled. Ferdosi says, Kobad was taken prisoner in the action in which his father lost his life; and that the Governor of Zabulistan, Suffrai, collected an immense army, and marched against Khoosh-Nuaz; a battle ensued, which was succeeded by negotiations, by which Khoosh-Nuaz gave up Kobad. Suffrai placed this prince on the throne, and deposed Pallas, after a reign of four years. But the Greek writers are probably right, who state, that Pallas was the brother of Firoze, and left by him as regent in his absence.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 132 chap . vi. as in many others, the belief of a good omen aided to produce its fulfilment. No events of consequence occurred during the reign of Pallas, which lasted four years. The name of that prince is not mentioned by some historians of this dynasty. Kohad sue- Though Kobad* succeeded to the crown, all the affairs of the Zte 0 ^ kingdom continued to be managed by Soukraf (or Sukhvar), his A - D - 488 - minister, who had made Pallas a mere pageant. He desired that. Kobad should be the same: but that prince became impatient of restraint; and, irritated by the open neglect with which he was treated, secretly prevailed upon the commander of his forces, whose name was Shahpoor, to destroy Soukra. The tenets of The religious impostor, MazdakJ, began to propagate his creed in Mazdir st0r the tenth year of Kobad's reign. The most alluring tenet of this new religion was, the community of females, and of property; a popular doctrine, which brought him numerous converts. The foundation of this leading principle of the religion of Mazdak was curious: he argued, that, as every thing animate and inanimate belonged to God, it was impious in man to claim, or to appropriate to himself, that which was the property of his Creator; and, as such, destined for the common use of all human beings. Mazdak forbade the use of flesh; and, clothed in coarse woollen, and devoted to prayer, gave, in his own person, an example of an abstemious and pious life. This impostor would probably have shared the fate of many others, and perished without a place on the page of history, had he not, by a pretended miracle, obtained a victory over the * The Cabades of the Greeks. t Zeenut-ul -Tuarikh.

He told chap . vr. that monarch, that he did not desire him to receive him as an apostle, till he witnessed some supernatural act that should confirm his mission. « ll Kobad attended him, as he had requested, to the temple of fire, and prose,yte • heard and beheld Mazdak hold converse with the sacred flame: for he had so artfully placed a man behind it, that the voice which answered his questions, appeared to proceed from the fire itself. Kobad was completely convinced, and continued, during life, to believe in the truth of the doctrine of Mazdak, whose followers greatly increased during the reign of his royal convert. It is related*, that the impostor had the insolence to require that the king should give him the mother of Nousheerwan, in order to prove his sincerity in the religion he had embraced; and that Kobad would have complied, but for the anxious entreaties of the young prince, who prayed, with tears in his eyes, both to his father and Mazdak, that his mother might be saved from the disgrace of such prostitution. The progress of the new religion introduced complete anarchy into the state; every where the votaries of Mazdak seized the wives, the daughters, and the property of others. The king could not punish them, for their creed was his: but his nobles cherished other sentiments, and they soon saw that their union was essential to their preservation. They combined, seized Kobad, put him in prison, and raised his brother, Jamasp, to Kobad is im- the throne.

His death. Kobad carried on a successful war against the Roman Emperor, Anastasius: and died, after a long and diversified reign of forty-three years. He was the founder of several cities: among which were Burdah and Gunjah. The latter is still a town of importance: it stands on the frontiers of Georgia, and is, at present, in the possession of Russia. What a change has the lapse of some centuries producedi The empire of Persia, the great rival of the Roman power, now appears unable to resist the tide of civilisation and of conquest, which comes upon her, not from that fountain of early knowledge, the East, or the learned West, but from the frozen regions of the North; from a land unknown to her historians, long inhabited by wretched and savage tribes of ignorant barbarians, who, from a com bination of powerful causes, the genius of some of their sovereigns, * It has been said, she prostituted her person to effect this object.

THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 135 the example of southern Europe, and the influence of a religion chap. vi. which has every where improved the condition of mankind, have overcome all those natural obstacles which opposed their rise, and started, as if by magic, into great and imperial power. It was during the latter years of the reign of Kobad, that the Romans built the famous fortified City of Dara, which was meant city of Dara by the Emperor Anastasius to be an advanced post of sufficient strength to keep the Persians* in check. This fortified town was a source of constant jealousy to one empire, and of confidence to the other. It has been affirmed-f*, that it answered the object for which it was built for sixty years: but we must determine, before we adopt this conclusion, how far its erection provoked those attacks which it so long resisted, and which at last brought ruin not only on it ; but upon all the Roman towns and territories in its vicinity. Kobad left several sons; but he appears always to have shown the most decided preference for Nousheerwan: and that early senti ment of his mind must have every day gained strength, from an observation of the extraordinary wisdom and goodness which .marked that prince's character. At his death, he bequeathed his kingdom to this favourite sonlf. The testament was committed to the principal * Vide Gibbon, Vol. VII. page 139.

' All the principal offices,' the prince exclaimed, ' are filled by worthless and despicable men; ' and who would, in such days, make a vain attempt to govern this ' kingdom according to principles of wisdom and of justice. If I ' should do my duty y I must make great changes; and the result of « these may be bloodshed : my sentiments respecting many of you ' would perhaps alter; and families whom I now regard, would be ' ruined. I have no desire to enter into such scenes: they are neither ' suited to my inclination nor my character, and I must avoid them*/' The nobles could not deny the truth of what he said; and convinced, for the moment, of the necessity of a reform, they took an oath to support him in all his measures, to give implicit obedience to all his orders, and to devote their persons and property to his service, and to that of their country. Nousheerwan Nousheerwan, satisfied by these assurances, ascended the throne, comes to the an( j assembled all his court; to whom, we are told, he made the crown; a. d. 531. following address : ' That authority which I derive from my office, ' observe,' said he, ' every estimable quality united in you, but you have one fault; ' you judge too severely of others.

The principles of the doctrine of this impostor have been already explained. His faith was at variance with the established worship of the kingdom; and its fundamental tenet was the annihilation of all property: anarchy was its certain result: and a monarch like Nousheerwan could not have required the aid of that resentment, which the insult he had received, during his father's lifetime, had kindled, to induce him to adopt every means for the speedy destruction of so dangerous a religion. But the numbers of Mazdak's followers might have com pelled him to use artifice; and we cannot altogether reject that account which represents the just Nousheerwan as having been forced, by attention to the safety of the state, to stoop to an * This, no doubt, implied his intention to exercise toleration towards the different religions that then distracted the empire; and justifies the opinion, that, in the com mencement of his reign, he temporized with the followers of Mazdak. t Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. vol. i. tTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. unworthy stratagem in order to prevail upon tbe impostor, and a number of his followers, to assemble near his palace, where, instead of meeting that kind treatment which his promises had led them to Puts Mazdak, expect, they were all put to death* : but it is more probable, and much more consonant to the character of this monarch, to credit that relation which states, that a man complained of his wife having been taken from him by a disciple of Mazdak. The king desired the pre tended prophet to command his follower to restore the woman: but the mandate of the earthly monarch was treated with scorn and con tempt, when its effect was contrary to what was deemed a sacred precept. Nousheerwan, enraged at this bold opposition to his authority, instantly ordered the execution of Mazdak, which was followed by the destruction of many of his followers, and the pro. scription of his delusive, but abominable tenets f. Nousheerwan was indefatigable in his endeavour to promote the prosperity of his dominions: he ordered all bridges, of every descrip tion, that had fallen into decay, to be repaired: he directed many * The ground where they were ordered to assemble, had, according to this relation, been previously cut into deep wells and trenches, into which they were precipitated. f Another account is given by the author of the Tubree of this transaction. It is stated, that Munzer, a prince of Arabia, who had revolted from Kobad, when he em braced the faith of Mazdak, returned to the court of his son; who, delighted at the event, said publicly, when both that prince and Mazdak were present, that he had only two wishes at heart. ' One,' said the monarch, ' is accomplished by your return to « allegiance: the other,' he added, ' is to root out this new faith.' Mazdak exclaimed, in a passion, ' How can you cherish a thought of destroying a religion which so many ' thousands have embraced ?' Nousheerwan, offended at his violence, ordered him to be slain: and that act was followed by the death of his followers: and the women, children, and property they had taken, were restored to those to whom they belonged. ■— Tarikh Tubree.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. loj new edifices to be built: and we are told bj his flattering historians, chap . vr. that every town and village within his kingdom that had been destroyed, were restored and repeopled.

But the disgraceful peace which the Emperor Justinian the Einperor purchased at the commencement of the reign of Nousheerwan, the J ™ n 5 - 3 3 subsequent war, the reduction of all Syria, the capture of Antiochf, the unopposed progress of the Persian monarch to the shores of the a. d. 540.

This the ambitious disciple offered to do: and, when carried before the King of Persia, informed his majesty, that the boar which he had seen, in his sleep, take the cup of wine he meant to drink from his hand, alluded to a youth who had found his way into the haram.

The youth and his mistress were put to death, and Abouzurg-a-Mihir promoted. * This probably has arisen from their confounding his actions with those of Sapor, t The habits of absolute and barbarous monarchs are nearly the same in all ages. Even the just Nousheerwan brought away the inhabitants of Antioeh, to settle them on the banks of the Tigris. His historians have endeavoured to mitigate this act, by stating, that he built, near Ctesiphon, a town so exactly like Antioch, (of which he had directed a most minute plan to be drawn,) that each of the inhabitants of that city, when they reached it, went as naturally to his own house, or rather its counterpart, as if he had never left his native city!! i—Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 1,41 however, assert, that his genius, as a military leader, even when his chap, vl fortune was at the highest, was checked by that of Belisarius, who was twice sent to oppose his progress; and whose success, considering his want of means, and the character of the court he served, was certainly wonderful. In all the negotiations which took place between the Emperor Justinian and Nousheerwan, the latter assumed the tone of a superior. His lowest servants* were treated, at the imperial court, in a manner calculated to inflame the pride, and raise the insolence of a vain and arrogant nation: and the impressions which this conduct must have made, were confirmed by the agreement of the Roman emperor to pay thirty thousand pieces of gold; a sum which could have been of no importance to Nousheerwan, but as it showed the monarch of the western world in the rank of one of his tributaries. In a second war His second with the Roman Emperors Justin and Tiberius, Nousheerwan, who, Romans, though eighty years of age, still led his armies, experienced some reverses of fortune: but the perseverance and valour of the aged sovereign were ultimately rewarded by the conquest of Dara, and And conquest At the period of these great successes over the Romans, the empire of Nousheerwan had been equally extended in other quarters.

Disaffection of The only insurrection that disturbed the reign of Nousheerwan, Nousciuzad. ^ ^ that of kig sonj Nouschizad. The mother of this prince was a Christian of great beauty, of whom the king was passionately fond: but his entreaties could never induce her to change her religion for that of her sovereign: and her son, taught by her early lessons, rejected as impious the rites of the Magi, and openly professed his belief in the doctrine of Christ. The contempt which the zealous but incautious youth showed for the religion of his country, enraged his father, who, to punish what he deemed his heresy, placed him in confinement. Some time after this act, when Nousheerwan was in Syria, he had an attack of illness, and a report was spread of his death. Deceived by this rumour, Nouschizad effected his escape, released other prisoners, collected a number of followers, of whom many were Christians, and attempted to establish himself in Fars and Ahwaz. Nousheerwan, the moment he heard of his revolt, Ram-Burzeen directed Ram-Burzeen, one of his principal leaders, to march against ZT ^him. Persian authors^ have given the letter of instructions which he sent upon this occasion to thai officer. ' My son Nouschizad,' the monarch wrote, ' hearing a rumour that went abroad of my ' death, has, without waiting for its confirmation, taken up arms: ' he has released many prisoners: he has expended treasure which ' I meant to employ against the enemies of the kingdom: and he * Mirkhond.THE BISTORT OF PERSIA. 243 ' h as taken the field without reflection on the consequences which chap. vi.

If, ' however, Nouschizad will return to his allegiance, send back the ' prisoners he has released to their places of confinement, put to ' death some particular officers and nobles who have espoused his ' cause, and allow the rest of his followers to disperse and go where ' they choose, I will consent to pardon him: but, should he continue ' in rebellion, and not submit when he receives this assurance of ' mercy, Ram-Burzeen is directed not to lose an instant in attacking ' him. A man of illustrious descent, whose disposition inclines him ' to evil, should be treated according to his conduct, not his birth. ' It is a good action to slay a wicked man who takes arms against ' the king, who is the sovereign of the earth. Let no fear prevent ' your cutting the thread of his days: it will be by himself, not by ' you, that his blood is shed: he flies with ardour to the religion of ' Caesar, and averts his head from our crown. ' But, should Nouschizad be made prisoner in action, hurt not ' one hair of his head: shut him up in the same palace where he ' was before confined, along with those slaves that attended him, ' Let him be furnished with all he wants, and allow none of our ' military officers to use expressions that can, in any degree, insult ' or wound the feelings of a son whom we still hold dear. If any ' one should abuse Nouschizad, let every dagger be pointed at him : ' first let him lose his tongue, and then his life; for, though that ' prince has dishonoured his birth, still it is from us that he derives ' his existence, and our affection continues his security/' There is, perhaps, more of stern justice and of state policy in these orders, than of that affection and goodness, which oriental authorsTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 144 chap . vi. delight in attributing to this monarch. His desire that his son should v -^ w/ be put to death* is but thinly veiled by the affected anxiety regard ing his respectful treatment if taken prisoner. The monarch's man- date was fully obeyed: Ram-Burzeen brought the prince to action. A few raw levies, led by an inexperienced youth, were soon defeated Nouschizad ia by the able general of Nousheerwan. Nouschizad was skint: dai»' ereda ° d and his con q ueror pretended to mourn over the victory which his valour had gained, exclaiming against his own bad fortune, in being the unhappy instrument of the death of one of the Royal House of Sassan.

Eastern monarehs delight to dis- chap. play their wealth and grandeur in the splendour of their embassies: Ns ^ v but their conduct, in this particular, has, in general, a better motive than vanity. It is from the style of his equipage, the magnificence of his presents, and the personal deportment of an ambassador, that ignorant nations judge of the power and character of the monarch whom he represents; and to this cause we must refer the minute account which every eastern historian deems it his duty to give of the state and appearance, as well as the conduct, of the different embassies that he describes. The internal regulations of Nousheerwan were excellent. He internal established a fixed and moderate land-tax* over all his dominions. vernment tresses; but whose beauty, as it appeared through this veil, we are told, was as over powering as a flash of day during a dark night. The Emperor of India's presents were equally magnificent. A thousand pounds weight of aloes wood. A vase, formed of one precious stone, and filled with pearls. On one side of this vase was engraven the figure of a lion; on the other, that of a young maiden, of whom the height was seven hands' breadth. The eye-lashes of this beauty fell upon her cheeks; and through them the brilliancy of her eyes, reflected by the fairness of her complexion, shone like lightning. The Indian monarch also sent to Nousheerwan a carpet, made of a serpent's skin, finer than any silk, and more beau tifully speckled by the hand of nature than ever art could imitate. Mirkhond, and other Persian historians, dwell with delight on these exaggerated accounts of the presents sent to the greatest of Persian kings. * When this prince ascended the throne, one of his first measures was to fix the revenue and taxes. He levied a land-tax, or rather a crown share, on cultivated grounds, by the yoke; a term, which describes the quantity of land which a yoke of oxen can plough. The tax, or crown share, was fixed at one dirhem and sixty-four pounds weight in grain per yoke. This assessment was settled by measurement and by register. He also levied a capitation tax, by which the poorest male paid six dirhems, the richest forty-eight. Females were exempt from this tax. A tax was laid upon vol. i. u146 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. He imposed a capitation tax upon Jews and Christians: all persons under twenty and above fifty years of age were exempted Military disci- from service. The regulations, for preserving the discipline of his ?line ' army were still more strict than those of his civil government: and this great and discerning monarch applauded the courage of one of his inspecting generals, who, armed with great powers, in sisted upon his sovereign appearing at a review, and refused to register his name as a soldier of Persia, (a title of which Nousheerwan was proud,) because he was deficient in that equip ment which the regulations required*; he had neglected to bring the case of his bow. But, whatever may be his disposition, and however splendid his talents, one man can effect but little i and, where the rule is absolute, his orders will be evaded, and his con fidence betrayed. All the vigilance and justice of Nousheerwan could not prevent corruption and tyranny among the officers of his government. 'We are toldf, that an immense number of jackalls came, during the latter years of his reign, from the fields of Tartary into the provinces of Persia, the inhabitants of which were greatly alarmed at the horrid shrieks and screams J of these new visitors. fruit trees. Officers were appointed in every village and town to collect these taxes, or crown shares: and they were directed to be levied every four months; that is, in three equal payments each year. The system of revenue which was established by Nousheerwan, was followed by his successor: and, according to the author of the Tuarikh-e-Tubree, continued in force during his time, A. H. 302. We derive little information from this general account, which can only be considered as telling us, that Nousheerwan made some improvement in the system of collecting the revenue. * Zeenut -ul-Tuarikh. t Rozut -ul-SufFa and Zeenut-ul -Tuarikh. % The screams of jackalls are only heard at night, which renders them more terrify ing to persons unaccustomed to the noise.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ Intelligence of the event was sent to court. The king, partaking of chap. vi. the superstition of the age, demanded of the chief mobud, or high priest, what it portended. This officer gave a reply, which, while it shows him to have been a virtuous courtier*, satisfies us that Nou- sheerwan was, with all his great qualities, but a despot, to whose ear truth could only be spoken in an indirect manner. ' By what I ' have learnt from the history of former times,' said the pontiff, ' it ' is when injustice prevails, that animals of prey spread themselves ' over a kingdom.' Nousheerwan, who well knew what was meant, immediately appointed a secret commission of thirteen persons, in whom he placed complete confidence, and directed them to traverse each province of his vast empire, and convey to him a true report upon the conduct of the inferior officers of the state. The result of the inquiries of this commission, was the discovery of great abuses, and the execution of twenty-four petty governors, who were convicted of injustice and tyranny •f. Whatever success attended the endeavours of Nousheerwan His character, to promote the general happiness of his subjects, by the establish ment of justice, there can be no doubt of his personal love of it. A Roman ambassador, who had been sent to Ctesiphon with rich presents, when he was admiring the noble prospect from the windows of the royal palace, remarked an uneven piece of * We observe, in all oriental histories, that able and good ministers are represented as taking advantage of any incident, to convey, in an indirect manner, their advice to the monarchs they serve.

His firm and noble character resisted the influence of that luxury, by which he was courted: he neither gave himself up to indulgence, nor permitted it in others: and the aged monarch was seen, a short period before his death, leading his troops to the attack of Dara, with as active and ardent a spirit, as he had shown in his earliest enterprises. The history of the world affords many instances of a brilliant reign preceding the fall of a great and powerful dynasty of monarchs; and that gleam of splendour, which a nation has hailed as the meri dian of its fortunes, has, too often, proved to be the last ray of its expiring glory. The reason of this appears plain: an able but absolute ruler, who perceives the progress of decay in the state he governs, fears to adopt such remedies as could alone prevent its occurrence : his own condition is unhappily interwoven with those causes that are producing the effect; yet, willing to make some effort, he hopes to find a remedy for internal weakness in foreign conquest: but, in the exact proportion of his success in this attempt, is the evil he sought to avoid increased. He leaves his country with a great name, but with exhausted means : to a general spirit of corruption he has only afforded a wider scope of action: while he has multiplied the enemies of his country by the subjugation of other nations; who, impatient of their condition, generally find, in the early divisions of150 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vr. his leaders, or the incompetency of his successors, that opportunity of revenge which they so ardently desire. This was the result of all the glory of Nou sheer wan, who found Persia hastening to decay, and who adopted those means that have been described, to restore her strength. His success was unparalleled : and his great genius preserved, during his own life, the mighty empire which he had established. The limits of his dominions were even greater than those claimed for their country by the vanity of Persian geographers. At one period, the mandates of this monarch were obeyed from the shores of the Mediterranean to those of the Indus: from the Red Sea to the Caspian: and from the Euxine to the distant banks of the Jaxartes. Hoormuz Hoortnuz the Third* was declared successor to his father, Nou- the Third suc ceeds to the sheerwan, as his title to the throne was deemed superior to that of c1 a. v d. 579. the other princes, from the illustrious descent of his mother, who was daughter to the Khakan of Tartary. The claims he derived from high birth were supported by an impression of his virtue and talent. The education of Hoormuz had been one of the principal cares of his father: his tutor was Abouzurg-a-Mihir-f, the vizier of Nousheerwan. We are informed, that the young prince venerated the teacher of * Hormisdas the Third of Greek writers. t This minister, who is, as before stated, sometimes called Boozurg-Mihir, has been termed the Seneca of the East 6 . He is said to have invented the game of chess: and his ability and fame were such, that the Christians of the period during which he lived have sought to prove him a Christian: and Mahomedans claim him for their faith, though he lived before the Koran was made public. 6 Gibbon,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. loJ his youth: and, as long as he remained at court, the country pro- chap . vr. spered; but, when increasing age and infirmities led the virtuous minister to retire, his pupil appeared at once to change his character. Released from that painful restraint which the example of his father, and the lessons of his tutor, had, for a time, imposed, he plunged into every excess. All the respectable officers of government were either removed or put to death, and the administration of public affairs committed to low and wicked men, who knew that, while they managed to preserve the favour of their weak and vicious master, they might practise, unpunished, every oppression. The early consequences of this great change of rule, were foreign wars, and internal rebellion. The provinces of India and Arabia, which The provinces had confessed the paramount power of Nousheerwan, disdained Lll' to pay tribute, or to yield obedience to his unworthy successor. 10 pay tribute - The army of the Emperor of the Romans advanced into Meso- The Romans potamia; and the hordes of the great Khakan of Tartary crossed the Oxus, and demanded a free passage through Persia, Persia ' on the pretext of intending to make war upon the Emperor of Constantinople. To this the alarmed Hoormuz at first assented: but their conduct, and the council of the wisest of those who still remained at his court, soon satisfied him that he had admitted into his kingdom the most dangerous of all enemies*. He determined, therefore, to make an effort to expel them; and was fortunate in his choice of a general, whose person, we are informed, was described in * The name of the Khakan of Tartary, at this period, was Saye Shah: he was the maternal uncle of Hoormuz.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. a prophecy*. An astrologer had foretold that the Khakan should be slain, and his army dispersed, by a small force, commanded by a leader of lofty stature, an open countenance, curled hair, dark complexion, thick and joining eye-brows, a lean body, and an awkward figure. This description so exactly pointed out Baharam, one of the chiefs of the Persian army, that the king could not but select him for the arduous enterprise. Baharamf knew the country in which he had to act: and this circumstance, combined with a superstitious belief in the prophecy that has been noticed, led him to limit his force to twelve thousand men. These, however, he took care should be the oldest and best soldiers in Persia. No man in his army was under forty years of age, and none above fifty. The astonished Hoormuz entreated his general to increase his numbers j.: but Baharam replied, that his experience had taught him, it was the quality, and not the numbers of soldiers, which gave success: nor was he deceived.

The last is nearest the Pehlivi name, which, I have before slated, is Vararam. % Some authors state, that a larger army could not be assembled, and that the policy of the general, to prevent an unfavourable impression, pretended he would take no more, as twelve thousand was the fortunate number foretold : but this is improbable. 11 According to some authors, Baharam fought the Tartars in Mazenderan: others say, Khorassan.

It is stated several authors*, that Id SI™ the latter prince was not slain, but sent prisoner to Madain, with all ki ' ed ' the booty and treasure taken from the Tartars. Though the spoil was immense, an insidious courtier represented to Hoormuz, that it was but a small proportion of what had been actually takenf. The prince listened to these insinuations; and, full of envy and alarm at the great success of Baharam, he learnt, with satisfaction, that that commander had met with a reversej, in a subsequent action with the Roman army. Conceiving this event gave him the opportunity he desired, to disgrace and ruin a chief, whose reputation was his crime, he sent him a suit of female apparel ||, a distaff, and a spindle. The rough soldier immediately put on the dress he had received, and pre sented himself to his army. ' Behold,' said he, ' the reward with ' which the monarch I serve has deigned to crown my services.' The burst of indignation was general: the soldiers hailed Baharam as iv , rmy their sovereign, and called upon him to lead them against the despicable wretch, who had dared, from his luxurious palace, to cast so insufferable an insult upon the brave defender of his country. Baharam felt too great an indignation at the conduct * Mirkhond, &amp;c. t This malicious insinuation is ascribed to Yezdan-Buksh, the favourite of Hoor- muz. The expression which the Persian author places in the mouth of the courtier, is curious. « The booty sent to you,' said Yezdan-Buksh, «is only the ear of the cow.'

But, whatever hopes he might have formed, his prudence forbade an immediate declaration of an intention to overthrow the dynasty a. d. 590. of the House of Sassan.

While his generals were subduing the Roman empire, Khoosroo was wholly devoted to the enjoyment of unheard-of luxury and magnificence.

Although the magnificence of this prince has been much exagge rated, we may conclude, that no monarch ever indulged in greater luxury and splendour. His reign, for more than thirty years, was marked by a success never surpassed by the most renowned of his ancestors. It was, however, the weakness and distraction of the Roman empire which gave fame to this vain-glorious ruler; who, while his generals were conquering Syria, Nubia, Egypt, and Colchis, and occupying, with his victorious troops, a camp at Chalcedon, which for twelve years insulted the fallen fortunes of Constantinople, seemed only to value his conquests as they added to his pleasures. The vast territories which his armies subdued were exhausted, that his palaces, and the gorgeous state of his royal person, might exceed all that history ever told of kingly grandeur. But Khoosroo, while satiating himself with enjoyment, was destined to become a memorable example of the instability of human happiness and glory. The Mahomedan authors, from whom I write, ascribe the dreadful reverses, which marked the latter years of this prince, to the indignation ot a just God, who poured all the phials of his wrath upon the head of a guilty monarch, that had dared, with impious and accursed hands, to tear the letter of his holy prophet, Mahomed*. Christian authors, * Khoosroo Purveez was encamped on the banks of the Karasoo River when he received the letter of Mahomed, Enraged at being called upon by an Arabian, ofTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. with more reason, deem his end a just punishment for the cruelties chap. vi. and excesses which his armies committed in the Roman territories: but the cause of the rapid decline of his fortune is as obvious as that of its rise. The Emperor Heraclius, alike remarkable for weakness Heradius and indulgence in the palace, and for extraordinary valour and up^iT th' military skill in the field, found himself compelled either to abandon Persians ' the purple, or to make a great effort to defeat his numerous and powerful enemies. His first impulse, we are told, was to escape a struggle that he dreaded: but the patriarch* of his capital arrested his flight, and made him swear at the holy altar to live and die in the defence of his countryf. The wonderful success with which his resolution was crowned, is fully related by the historians of the West, and not contradicted by those of the East. The sudden invasion of Persia by a Roman J army, led by a warlike emperor, awakened A.D.622. whose name he had probably never before heard, to renounce the religion of his fathers, he tore the letter, and cast it into the Karasoo. For this action, the moderate author of the Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh calls him a wretch, and rejoices in all his subsequent mis fortunes. These impressions still exist. I remarked to a Persian, when encamped near the Karasoo, in 1800, that the banks of that river were very high, which must make it difficult to apply its waters to the purposes of irrigation. ' It once fertilized the ' whole country,' said the zealous Mahomedan: ' but its channel sunk with horror ' from its banks, when that madman, Khoosroo, threw our holy prophet's letter into ' its stream; which has, ever since, been accursed and useless.' * Persian authors say, with true national superstition, that he was encouraged to attack Persia by dreams. f Gibbon, Vol. VIII. page 228. $ The Persian king owed much of his success to the aid of the Avars, a tribe of Tartars; who, when driven out of their country by some Turkish hordes, solicited and obtained, from the weak policy of the Emperor Justinian, leave to feed their flocks within the limits of the empire. To oppose the ravages of these barbarians, Heraclius made an alliance with their conquerors ; and a tribe of Turks, termed Khozars, issued,160 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. Khoosroo from his dream of pleasure : and, in a period of six suc- cessive years, he endured the misery of losing all his foreign con quests ; of seeing Persia overrun by victorious enemies, who defeated his troops wherever they encountered them, and marched, in one direc tion, as far as the Caspian; in another, to Isfahan; destroying in their progress all his splendid palaces, plundering his hoarded treasures, and dispersing, in every direction, the countless slaves of his pleasure. Khoosroo Purveez saw all this without one effort to stop the mighty Khoosroo work of ruin. He fled, at the advance of Heraclius, alone*, and Dusttjird. like a deserter, from his own troops that guarded Dustajird. Yet, ™ even in the wretched state to which his fortune and character had reduced him, he rejected an offer of peace made by the generous humanity of his conqueror. But the subjects of Khoosroo had lost all regard for a monarch whom they deemed the sole cause of the desolation of his country: a conspiracy was formed against him: and, that his cup of misery might be full, Khoosroo was seized by his eldest son, Schiroueh -f, cast into a dungeon, and soon under their chief, Zubil, from the plains of Volga, and joined the emperor in Georgia. This we may pronounce to be the first appearance of a Turkish tribe in Persia. # It is stated by some authors, that he carried Shereen with him. He fled nine days before Heraclius arrived. t We are informed by Gibbon, (Vol. VIIL page 254,) that Khoosroo had resolved to place the tiara upon the head of Merdaza, the most favoured of his sons; and that Siroes (Schiroueh), indignant at this attempt to put his right of primogeniture aside, conspired with some malecontents to dethrone his father ; who was seized, and expired on the fifth day of his confinement. Both Greek and Persian authors, he adds, state, that he was insulted, famished, and tortured by his inhuman and unnatural son, who only enjoyed for eight months the fruit of his crimes. The principal of these facts are stated upon the authority of the letter from the Emperor Heraclius.— Chron.

Persian writers record several combats which he fought with the most renowned of the rebel chieftains who opposed his elevation to the thronej: but, enervated by a life of luxury and indulgence, he shrunk from the evils by which he was assailed; and, by his conduct in his latter years, abandoned all title to glory, except such as the memory of his magnificence, and the tale of his extravagant love for the beautiful Shereen, can bestow.

After killing the king, Hoormuz went to Schiroueh, and told him all that had passed.

The murdered body of her former lover was shown to her; and she immediately swallowed a poisonf which produced instant dissolu tion. Whatever was her motive; whether it was horror at the incestuous passion of Schiroueh, love for her lost sovereign, or a desire of fame, which led Shereen to sacrifice her existence at the tomb of Khoosroo; the act has immortalized her name, which is, to this day, associated, in Persia, with all that is beautiful and delightful in the female sex. While the Emperor Heraclius retired, ' after six glorious cam- ' paigns, to enjoy the sabbath of his toils at Constantinople J, the kingdom of Persia was left to perish under the accumulated evils of a dreadful famine; the disputes of proud and luxurious nobles; a succession of weak sovereigns, or rather pageants of power; and the attack of a terrible enemy; for the flame which Mahomed had kindled in Arabia, began already to spread, and to threaten an equal fate to the aged and decayed empires of Rome and of Persia. Schiroueh. Schiroueh, the son of Khoosroo Purveez, reigned only eight ™ months. He is described as a prince who paid attention to Shereen should be his reward. The same story adds, that he was on the point of com- pleting his labour, when Khoosroo, fearing to lose his mistress, sent an old woman to inform Ferhad that the fair object of his desire was dead. He was at work on one of the highest parts of the rock when he heard the mournful intelligence. He immediately cast himself headlong, and was dashed in pieces. * Rozut-ul-Suffa.

We are told by Persian historians, that this dethrone. t0 queen restored the sacred cross, which had been borne away from Jerusalem; and, by that act, acquired great favour with the Roman emperor. But this is evidently erroneous: for there is no doubt that the Emperor Heraclius, when he returned from Persia, carried that precious relick to Constantinople, which was deemed a more splendid trophy of victory, than all his spoils and conquests.

When Shenendeh was deposed, (for he appears Arzem-dokht to have been too insignificant to merit death,) Arzem-dokhtf, another throne! 1 t0the daughter of Khoosroo Purveez, was raised to the throne. This prin- aIh.ii !' cess » was a ^ ke distinguished by her sense and beauty, resolved to take the whole management of the affairs of the kingdom into her own hands. She would not even appoint a vizier. But the fatal passion of a Persian noble defeated all her designs. Ferakh Hoor- muz, the Governor of Khorassan^ fell violently in love with her; or, perhaps, with her dominions. He committed the charge of his pro vince to his son, Roostum, and proceeded to court, where he soon contrived to make his love known to his royal mistress; who (though indignant at the discovery,) pretended, while she refused her hand, to return the passion of Ferakh, whom she deluded to an assignation, where he was murdered by guards stationed for the purpose. The moment his melancholy fate was known to his son Roostum, he col lected a large army, and marched from KhorassanJ to Madain. The queen was unable to oppose him; and the young chief revenged isputtodeatb. his father by putting her to a cruel death. # Mirkhond. f This princess is also called Azerm-dokht, Azadmi dokht, Arzeman dokht, and Zademi-dokht.

Kesra, however, being found unfit to rule, was instantly onthethrone, murdered*. The next story circulated was, that a prince named andmurdered. Ferokhzad, the son of Khoosroo Purveez by a female singer of Ferokiwad. Isfahan-f*, had fled from the cruelty of Schiroueh to Nisibis, where he then resided. He was sent for, and the highest hopes were enter tained from his elevation: but, before he had reigned a month, his days were terminated by poison. Such were the events which is poisoned, immediately preceded the reign of Yezdijird, and the fall of the Persian monarchy. They denote a state of great anarchy: and the elevation of so many puppets to the throne, shows that the manage ment of public affairs was, at this period, a subject of continual contest among the chief nobles, who desired to veil their ambition under the garb of loyalty and attachment to the family of Sassan; while they only raised such creatures to power, as they thought would be the subservient instruments of their selfish schemes of aggrandizement. Many Persian historians^ take no notice of some of the last-men- Yezdijird tioned kings, but pass from Pooran-dokht, the daughter of Khoosroo ^ s e tothe Purveez, to Yezdijird, son of Shahryar, whom they term a lineal A D - 632 - descendant of that monarch.

This prince was probably of the same descrip- His reign, tion as others that have been noticed. He appears to have had no talents for rule; and to have been, from the hour of hisi elevation till his death, an instrument in the hands of his ambitious nobles. The reign of Yezdijird-f* has obtained a celebrity in history from its having been that in which the ancient empire of Persia was sub verted by a band of naked lizard eaters; for such was the con temptuous appellation formerly used by their vain neighbours, when they described the tribes of Arabia. No common cause could have produced such a revolution : and Persian historians are alike disposed, from superstition and from patriotism, to deem its accomplishment one of the greatest miracles by which God has manifested the truth of the Mahomedan religion. Those who take a worldly view of this great event will discover, that a monarchy, like that of Persia, ener vated by luxury&gt; distracted by internal divisions, exhausted by foreign wars, and bending to its fall, from age and from weakness, was ill calculated to resist the enthusiastic robbers of Arabia; who, fired by the double hope of present and of future enjoyment, rushed like an overwhelming torrent on the nations by whom they were surrounded. But, before the progress of this great work of de struction is narrated, it will be necessary to say a few words upon the country, character, and religion, of that extraordinary race by whom it was effected. * He was banished, these authors state, on account of a prophecy, which foretold the fall of the empire under a descendant of Shahryar. t Isdegertes the Third of the Greeks.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ Though there are several lofty ranges of mountains in the penin- chap . vr. sula of Arabia, the greatest part of that celebrated country consists of level, sandy, and arid plains, which can support but few inha-Arabtf 0 ' 0f bitants. We may, indeed, judge of the whole of this extensive tract by our knowledge of Yemen, or Arabia the Happy. The few culti vated spots, the thinly scattered groves, and the small though pure streams of this province, could only be deemed delightful by men whose eyes were unaccustomed to vegetation, who seldom found a shade to protect them from the scorching rays of a meridian sun, and whose thirst was usually allayed by the brackish water of the desert. The inhabitants of this peninsula are an original and unmixed race. They boast that their country has never been conquered; and we have no record of the whole of the peninsula being subject to a foreign yoke: but the Romans, at one period, possessed a part of Arabia*: and the province of Yemen, and some others adjoining it, have been often overrun, and, at times, tributary to Persia. That the monarchs of that country, and the emperors of Rome, did not pursue their conquests till they had subdued the deserts of Arabia, may have arisen from other causes than a dread of the courage of its roving inhabitants. Independance is the its independ. certain and just reward of all who consent to a life of privation and ance ■ of hardship. Deserts and mountains have ever been the sacred sanctuaries of the free and brave : and those who are content to inhabit them, are seldom exposed to attack; for ambition, only envious of wealth and grandeur, could derive but little gratification * The Roman province of Arabia was conquered by Palma, a lieutenant of Trajan. Its capital was Petra : but neither Trajan, nor any of his successors, made any serious progress in their further attempts on this kingdom.168 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. from the possession of a country, whose fields no labour could render fruitful, and whose inhabitants no period could make slaves*. inhabitants. The native of Arabia is not a very robust man, but he is well formed and active, and, both from habit and education, careless of danger, and insensible to fatigue. His mind is quick, rather than intelligent: and his character is at once marked by an extreme of credulity and of enthusiasm. He is allied, in all his pleasures and fatigues, to the horse and camel of his desert : and these animalsf appear to have obtained an actual superiority over their own species, from being elevated into the companions of their masters. Religion. The Arabs, in former days, worshipped the sun and planets; but they were latterly distracted by a variety of religions: some con tinued in the faith of their fathers; while others adopted the Jewish and Christian tenets. These differences in belief, added to other causes, * The history of Arabia is anticipated, and the habits and independance of its free and brave, but rude, inhabitants, described in the following verse in the Bible, respect ing its founder, Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar: — ' And he will be a wild man: his hand will he against every man, and every man's ' hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.'— Genesis, chap. vi. verse 12. f The horse of Arabia is unequalled for speed, temper, and the power of bearing fatigue : and it is one of the most extraordinary facts in natural history, that through out all Asia, Africa, and Europe, the best and most valued breed of this noble animal is descended from the Arabian stock. The camel and dromedary of the desert is hardly considered by the Arab as inferior to his horse. This patient and powerful animal supplies him with milk for his support, transports his property and family from one quarter of the desert to another; and, when occasion requires, enables him to pursue or fly from his enemies to any distance, and with almost incredible speed.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ 16c had long rendered their country a scene of contention and of weak- chap . vr. ness. But the doctrine of Mahomed prevailed almost as soon as it was promulgated: and that extraordinary man lived to see his faith o^aWd acknowledged over all Arabia. That the religion which he taught P^evails • contained some of the noblest and most sublime tenets, is as true as that these were taken from the purest of all sources. But it had, in its very origin, the character of violence; and, while it showed one great, all-powerful, and merciful Creator, and called upon the idolatrous Arab to renounce his plurality of gods for a better worship, it offered, as the reward of his conversion and obedience, the com plete gratification of all the desires of his heart. The goods of this world, and every earthly enjoyment, were the pious prize of the valour of the faithful soldier who drew his sword against infidels: and, if he fell, a paradise was provided, in which he was promised perpetual youth, amid scenes where palaces of gold and rubies, virgins of never-fading beauty, clear streams, and sweet-scented groves, were to afford him eternal bliss. This religion, which proclaimed a war on the property of all who did not receive it, was well adapted to the principles and habits of those to whom it was first addressed. One of its most remarkable features was that boundless indulgence which it granted to the strongest of all the sensual passions of man. By this indulgence, it has furnished an ever-operating motive to power, whether in the hands of the despot of a kingdom, or of a village, the baneful effects of which must be felt in every region where this faith prevails. It has, by reducing one half of the human species to the condition of slaves, rendered the other half tyrants, and thereby placed an170 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vi. almost insuperable obstacle to the progress of improvement and civilization. This appears to be the general character of that religion by which the enthusiastic Arabs were kindled. Their ardent minds received with delight, doctrines, which at once elevated the soul, fired the imagination, and gratified the passions. The zeal and ardour of converts were not likely to seek other causes for the success of their arms, than the divine origin of that faith which they had embraced; and the tenets of Mahomed were calculated to give victory to his followers. The meed of superior piety was the reward of distinguished courage; and, in the early days of this religion, the hero alone was deemed worthy of Paradise. The first at- The first attack made by the Arabs on the Persian empire, was Arabs on the during the reign of the Caliph Omar, who commanded one of his ~ un - leaders, Abou-Obeyd, to cross the Euphrates. The force employed must have been small, as we find it opposed by two detachments of two thousand men each; one of which was commanded by Jyan; and the other by Roostum-Ferokhzad. The Persians were afterwards reinforced by a corps under a general called Jalenous, and took post on the east side of the Euphrates, where they were attacked by Abou- Obeyd. The action was furious; but the Arabian chief lost it by his imprudent courage. He observed, we are informed, a white elephant in the centre of the Persian host: and towards this animal, (which he deemed the object of their superstition*,) he fought his way with # I have followed the author of the Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. The Persians had no religious veneration for elephants; but ignorant soldiers might have had a superstitious feeling regarding the fate of the animal that carried their commander.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 17] irresistible valour, and with one blow of his scimetar struck off its chap, vl trunk*. The furious animal, maddened by pain, rushed upon the rude assailant, and trampled him to atoms. The Arabs, dispirited Abou-obayd by the fate of their leader, fled in great confusion: numbers were kllled ' slain in the action: more were drowned; as the bridge on the Euphrates, across which they had advanced, was broken down. The few that survived retreated to Salabeh, a place on the west bank of The Arabs the river, and informed Omar of what had happened. The caliph SXV 0 reinforced them: and they advanced under Jereer-Ben-Abdullah into Irak; but they were again encountered and defeated by Mehran, the general of Pooran-docht The celebrated Durufsh Kawanee, or apron of the blacksmith K4w4h, which had been the royal standard of Persia for so many ages, was displayed in both these battles, and was, for the last time, propitious to Persia. Mehran, encouraged by success, ventured another action, but was defeated and slain, and his dispirited troops fled in dismay to Madain. The Persians attributed their bad success to the incompetency of their power less sovereigns. Ruler after ruler was dethroned and murdered, till the elevation of Yezdijird, which seems to have given a moment ary hope to the falling nation. The first measure of that monarch was, to send an envoy to Saad-ben-Wakass, the leader whom the caliph had appointed to the chief command of his forces employed against Persia; and Saad, in compliance with the request commu nicated through this person, sent a deputation to Madain, consisting of three old Arab chiefs. When these were seated in the presence of Yezdijird, that monarch, we are told, addressed himself to the Mirkhond.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 172 cttAP.

The garden was filled with foxes: ' and its indulgent master was forced to bar the gates, and put to ' death all the intruders, to save himself from ruin.

The firm and pious envoy heard, unmoved, a speech that at once displayed the extreme of pride and of weakness in the monarch by whom it was made. « Whatever thou hast said/' replied Shaikh Maghurah, ' regarding the former condition of the Arabs, is true. ' Their food was green lizards; they buried their infant daughters ' alivef; nay, some of them feasted on dead carcasses, and drank ' blood ; while others slew their relations, and thought them- ' selves great and valiant, when, by such an act, they became ' possessed of more property : they were clothed with hair gar ments ; knew not good from evil ; and made no distinction ' between that which is lawful and that which is unlawful. Such ' was our state. But God, in his mercy, has sent us, by a holy ' prophet, a sacred volume, which teaches us the true faith. By &lt;e it we are commanded to war with infidels, and to exchange our ' poor and miserable condition for that of wealth and power. ' We now solemnly desire you to receive our religion.

They encouraged the citizens to rise upon the Tartars: and not only recovered the city, but forced the Khakan to fly, with great loss, to Bokharah. A diligent inquiry was made after Yezdijird, whose fate was soon discovered. The miller fell a victim to popular rage; and the corpse of the monarch was embalmed and sent to Istakhr, to be interred in the sepulchre of his ancestors.

CHAPTER VII. General Reflections on the Religionj History, Antiquities, and Character of the Inhabitants of Persia, before the Mahomedan Conquest. chap. vii. It will be useful to pause a moment, at this period of the History, in order to examine into the nature and merits of those Authorities from which the preceding account of ancient Persia has been given. And a consideration of this subject will naturally lead to a notice of the religion, history, antiquities, and character of the former inha bitants of that kingdom. In our researches into the history of remote ages, the first facts which attract our attention, are those that relate to the mode in which the nations of the earth have paid their adoration to their Creator: and the precise substance and form of a people's worship can generally be traced many centuries beyond that period at which we find any authentic record of their history. This, in a great degree, arises out of the sublime nature of the subject; for, under whatever form ignorance or superstition may lead man to address his Maker, there is, in the act of devotion itself, that which, while it inspires awe and veneration, makes an indelible impression upon the human mind. The first efforts of a rude people are always directed to celebrate and perpetuate the rites of their religion. The earliest attempts of the pencil, the chisel, and the pen, are consecrated toTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 18] this object: and learning, in its dawn, has almost always been con- chap, vii, fined to those, who, being intrusted with the care of sacred ceremo- nies, have devoted their exclusive knowledge to the exaltation and support of that religion of which they were the ministers. It is obvious, therefore, that in an inquiry into the ancient history of every nation, the subject of religion has the first claim to our attention. Gur knowledge of that part of the history of Persia which Remarks on precedes the reign of Kaiomurs, the first prince of the Paish- theDabistan - dadian dynasty, rests upon the authority of the Dabistan*; a * This work is entitled to more attention, from the notice it received from that celebrated orientalist, Sir William Jones. The following is the account he gave of it: — « The rare and interesting tract on twelve different religions, entitled ' The « Dabistan,' and composed by a Mahomedan traveller, a native of Cashmere, named « Mohsan, but distinguished by the assumed surname of Fani, or Perishable, begins ' with a wonderfully curious chapter on the religion of Hushang, which was long ' anterior to that of Zeratusht, but had continued to be secretly professed by many ' learned Persians, even to the author's time : and several of the most eminent of them ' dissenting, in many points, from the Gabrs, and persecuted by the ruling powers of « their country, had retired to India; where they compiled a number of books, now ' extremely scarce, which Mohsan had perused, and with the writers of which, or with ' many of them, he had contracted an intimate friendship: from them he learned that ' a powerful monarchy had been established for ages in Iran, before the accession of u Cayumers; that it was called the Mahabadean dynasty, for a reason which will soon ' he mentioned; and that many princes, of whom seven or eight only are named in the « Dabistan, and among them Mahbul, or Maha Beli, had raised this empire to the ' zenith of human glory. If we can rely on this evidence, which to me appears unex- ' ceptionable, the Iranian monarchy must have been the oldest in the world: but it will « remain dubious, to which of the three stocks, Hindoo, Arabian, or Tartar, the first ' King of Iran belonged; or whether they sprang from a fourth race, distinct from any ' of the others.: and these are questions which we shall be able, I imagine, to answer.182 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vii. Persian work containing an account of twelve religions, written about a century and a half ago by a native of Cashmere, called Shaik Mahomed Mohsin, and surnamed Fani, or ' the Perishable/' This work, we are told, is taken from ancient Pehlivi manuscripts, and from verbal communications which its author asserts he had with Persians who still continued to profess, in secret, that religion which their ancestors had followed previous to Zoroaster. It contains an account of the dynasty of Mahabad, of Jy-Affram, of Shah-Kuleev, and of Yassan-Ajum: but the extravagant number of years assigned to these dynasties, and the character of the few events that are recorded, make us suspect that the historical part of this work is a mere fable, allusive to the early condition of mankind*. It is possible that Mohsin Fani may have taken this fable from the sources he pretends: but there appears throughout the whole of this branch of his subject a great desire to connect the ancient history of the Persians and Hindoos. The fourteen Mahabads are evidently the fourteen Menus of the latter nation; and the division which the first of that race made of the inhabitants of Persia into four castsf, seems to be a transcript, even to the names of the Hindoo tradition of the first establishment of that celebrated institution in India. These, ' precisely, when we have carefully inquired into the languages and letters, religion « and philosophy, and incidentally into the arts and sciences of the ancient Persians.' —Sir W illiam J ones's Works, Vol. I. page 78. * From some parts of this fable, we might almost be led to believe that it had an allusion to the antediluvian monarchs; and Sir William Jones informs us, that the modern Parsis, or Guebers, have traditions of the deluge. The subject merits inquiry. Those of that persuasion to whom I addressed myself upon this point, did not confirm the information which that learned and accomplished orientalist had received. 't* For the account of the first establishment of cast among the Hindoos, see the Institutes of Menu.—Sir W illiam J ones's Works, Yol. III. page 77.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 183 and other facts of a similar nature, lead us to doubt the authenticity chap. vii. of this part of the Dabistan : and our doubts are increased by the character of its author, who, though professing Mahomedanism, was a Sooffee, or Philosophical Devotee, and an avowed believer in the superstition of the Brahmens. His principles must have connected him with the most abstracted and visionary of that tribe: and we cannot be surprised that such a man, endowed with learning and a poetical* imagination, should take great liberties with his text, and have tried to reconcile jarring systems. Among the authorities that Mohsin Fani mentions having referred to, is the Dussateerf, or, as it is sometimes called, the Temarawatseer. This book, which is also quoted by the author of the Burhan Kuttah J, has been lately found, and is now in the possession of Moullah Firoze, a very respectable and learned priest of the Parsees||, or Guebers. The Dussateer is supposed to have been written by fifteen prophets, of whom the first was Mahabad, and the last Sassan§. The latter, who lived in the * In Persia and India those who have the talent of making verses, assume the name of Shaher, or poet, and hold a certain rank in society from this title. Such usually take up a Tukhullus, or poetical name, by which they style themselves in their poems : that of Mahomed Mohsin was Fani, or ' the Perishable,' and he is generally called Mohsin Fani. t This word, which is the plural of Dustoor, and means regulations, is said, by Sir William Jones, to have been given to it by modern translators. J The Burhan Kuttah is a Persian work of authenticity and character. || Moullah Firoze is an inhabitant of Bombay, where many of this class reside.

Its contents evidently relate to a period at which the inhabitants of Persia worshipped God and the planets §, or the host of heaven. The author of the Dabistan refers to other sources of informatiom besides the Dussateer. But, even supposing his industry had reco vered manuscripts which had been eagerly and vainly sought for ages, we cannot, unless we were in possession of the works he quotes, give our confidence to a writer who assumes such latitude in the frame of * Moullah Firoze states, that the original is an obsolete language, which he can translate with difficulty; but it is probably a dialect of Pehlivi, or he would not have been able to read any part of it. •j- One of these prophecies was the Mahomedan invasion and conquest of Persia; an event not difficult to predict in the reign of Khoosroo Purveez. J This book is in the possession of Moullah Firoze; who informed me, that he found it when searching among some old volumes at Isfahan. I made a short and hasty abstract of its contents: the nature of which tended, in no slight degree, to remove those doubts I had entertained of its authenticity. I could not discover the slightest motive for the fabrication of such a work. It certainly merits (as an object of curiosity) a literal translation : but I fear it will be found to contain little that can be termed historical. || Moullah Firoze's MSS. § The worship of the sun is deemed to be one of the most ancient in the world. I am told, by a learned friend, that the Hebrew term for East means 'before;' West, ' behind ;' South, the ' right;' and the North, ' obscure,' or ' concealed.' The three first of these terms denote the position of an adorer of the sun : the last describes the darkness with which the first inhabitants of the earth believed the northern part of the globe to be enveloped.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 185 his narrative. But the most curious and attractive part of the chap. vii. Dabistan is certainly that which relates to the usages and cere- monies of the worship of Persia, before the introduction of the religion of Zoroaster. According to Mohsin Fani, the primeval religion of Persia Was Primeval reli- a firm belief in one Supreme God, who made the world by his power, Sl0n ofPelsla ' and governed it by his providence; a pious fear, love, and adoration of him; a reverence for parents and aged persons; a fraternal affec tion for the whole human species; and a compassionate tenderness even for the brute creation. This belief was followed by a worship of the host of heaven, or the celestial bodies; in the adoration of which, the Sabian ritual is believed to have consisted. To this worship succeeded that of fire ; which, if we are to credit Ferdosi, worship of was first introduced by Houshung*, the grandson of Kaiomurs : but, toducedby as it is stated in his page, that Houshung commenced by making Houshung - successful war upon the deeves or magicians, and that he introduced * The following translation from Ferdosi gives an account of the origin of this worship. ' One day the king (Houshung) retired to the mountains, accompanied by ' some of his attendants: something appeared at a distance of enormous magnitude, ' black, tremendous, and glossy. Its two eyes seemed fountains of blood; the smoke ' which issued from its mouth obscured the air. The prudent Houshung contemplated ' it circumspectly; he seized a stone, and prepared to assail it. He threw it with the ' force of a hero, and the serpent no longer annoyed the world. The stone struck ' upon a rock, and both fell to pieces by the percussion. A brilliant flame sprung from ' the contact; and thus fire became the production of stone. The king prostrated ' himself before God, and offered devout supplications, for having thus obtained the ' sacred fire ; for which he erected a sanctuary in that spot. He said, * This fire is a ' ' divinity; let it be worshipped by all.' Night came, the mountain was covered with ' fire; it was surrounded by the king and his attendants. The event was celebrated ' by a feast, the name of which became that of the auspicious hero.' vol. i. 2 bplanets. 1 35 THE HISTORY QF PERSIA. chap. vii . new forms of worship, it is likely that he banished some of the old; and, perhaps, this might have been the idolatry which Mohsin Fani describes: but if so, it is fatal to that theory which would connect the worship of the Hindoos with that of the ancient Persians; the idols which the latter are said to have adored, and the mode of their adoration, being altogether dissimilar to those of India, worship of the The followers of Mahabad, we are informed in the Dahistan, worshipped the planets, represented by images of a very extra ordinary nature. That of Saturn, which was of black stone, had a head like an ape, the body of a man, and the tail of a hog.—The image of Jupiter was of an earthy colour: it represented a man with a vulture's head, on which was a crown, and on the top of it were the heads of a cock and a dragon. The right hand of this image held a turban, or wreath of cloth: the left, a crystal water pot.—The statue of Mars was of red stone. The image was that of a man: in his right hand, which hung by his side, was a bloody scimetar: and his left, which was raised, held an iron scourge.—The image of the Sun was of gold : it represented a man on horseback with two heads, and on each was a seven-pointed crown set with rubies. Though the faces of this idol were human, it had a dragon's tail. In its right hand was a slender rod of gold, and its neck was encircled by a collar of rich jewels.—The image of Venus was of human form, and wore a crown with seven peaks or points. The right hand held a bottle of oil, and the left a comb.—The image of Mercury had the body and tail of a fish, with the face of a hog. It had a crown on its head. The right hand held a pen, and the left an inkhorn.—The Moon was represented by an image of a man sitting upon a white cow. This idol had, in its right hand, an amulet of rubies; and inthe history of persia. , qr 16/ its left, a sprig of sweet basil. The author describes*, at great length, chap. vh. the temples of these idols; the incense offered at their shrine; and the classes of men bj whom thej were worshipped, as well as the seasons and modes of that worship. He remarks, that the planets were bodies of a spherical form, and that the figures he has repre sented were those under which the souls of these stars had appeared in the world of imagination to many saints, prophets, and philoso phers. These souls or genii, he states, have often assumed different shapes; in conformity to which, other representations have been given of them. It has been before observed, that the idolatrous religion which comparison Mohsin Fani ascribes to the ancient Persians, bears no resemblance to the worship of the Hindoos: it seems nearest that which was gion ° fp l f r - siti and tnat followed by a sect of Sabians, who, we are told, believed in God of the Sabi ' ' ans. but adored the planets, whom they deemed his vicegerents, that exercised an influence over all created things in the world. This sect of Sabians were said to follow the ancient Chaldeans, and to inherit their skill in astronomyf; a science built upon the same foundation as the adoration of the planets. And this leads us to remark, that the very title of the work from which Mohsin Fani gives an account of this worship, appears more like that of a * The minute description given by Mohsin Fani of the temples, idols, and modes of worship of the ancient Persians, is very curious. A translation of this part of the Dahistan has been made by Mr. Gladwin, and is published in the new Asiatic Miscellany.

He calls it the Akhteristan*, or the Region of the Stars. It is, however, impossible to enter into any minute comparison of the religion he ascribes to the ancient Persians, and the sect of Sabians that have been noticed, because we have only a very general account of the tenetsf of the * The author informs us, that he also referred to another work for information on this branch of his subject. This book he calls the ' Temarawatseer:' (this is said to be the Pehlivi name of the ' Dussateer.') After describing the modes in which wise aad learned men arrive at an exact knowledge of the influence of the stars on human events, he relates an anecdote of himself, which is at once a proof of his extreme superstition, and his great reliance on the Brahmens. ' In the year one thousand and sixty-one of ' the Hejirah, (or A. D. 1650),' Mahomed Mohsin observes, ' I had a complaint in ' my temples, for which I could not procure any remedy. The astrologers asserted, ' that it was occasioned by the vehemence of the planet Mars; and, in consequence, ' on the fourth of the month Zilkadeh (or ninth of October), of that year, some ' learned Brahmens assembled together, having an image of Mars, the proper ' incense, and other things necessary for the occasion. They first employed ' themselves in reading prayers, and invoking names ; after which, the chief man ' amongst them lifted up the image of Mars, and, with great reverence, said, ' ' Oh! renowned angel, and heavenly captain! lay aside thine anger, and bestow « &lt; mercy on such an one;' pointing towards me. Then they plunged the image ' into perfumed water; and instantly, on its immersion, the complaint ceased.' —Asiatic Miscellany. The name of the planet Mars in Hindoo astronomy is Mungul. The genii, or souls of the planets, are worshipped by the Hindoos, but under quite different figures from those mentioned in the Dabistan. There appears also a great difference between the mode in which the ancient Persians paid their adoration to the planets, and that which prevailed among the Arabians, who also worshipped them, before the intro duction of the Mahomedan religion. t See Picart's ' Religious Ceremonies,' Vol. VI. page 147, 153—155.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. latter; but we know that their opinions were adopted by many chap. learned persons in Asia, long after the introduction of the religion of Mahomed: and we are told, that a work*, explanatory of their tenets and ceremonies, was written in the third century of the Hejirah. It is not impossible that productions, in which religion was grafted on astronomy, should be preserved longer in the eastern than the western hemisphere. The delusive science of astrology, which has been but recently banishedf the European world, is still cherished throughout the whole of Asia. There is no Mahomedan of learning, in Persia, or in India, who is not an astrologer: rare works upon that science are more valued than any other: and it is remark able, that on the most trivial occasions, when calculating nativities and foretelling events, they deem it essential to describe the planets . * Thebit, a celebrated Sabian, who died in the third century of the Hejirah, wrote such a work; which is thought to be lost.— P icart's Religious Ceremonies, Vol. VI. page 156. f Wherever real knowledge has advanced, the belief of astrology has diminished. We are informed by Voltaire, that in the seventeenth century this science was esteemed in France. « They consulted astrologers,' that author remarks, « and believed in ' them. All the memoirs of that time, to begin with the History of the President De ' Thou, are filled with predictions. The grave and severe Duke de Sully seriously ' records those that were foretold of Henry the Fourth. This credulity, the most ' infallible mark of ignorance, was then so much in vogue, that they took care to « secrete an astrologer near Queen Anne of Austria's chamber, at the birth of Louis ' the Fourteenth. ' What is difficult to be believed,' he adds, ' but is nevertheless related by the ' abbot, Vittorio Siri, a cotemporary and well-informed writer, is, that Louis the ' Thirteenth was, from his infancy, surnamed The Just, because he was born under ' Libra, or the sign of the balance.'190 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . in terms* not unsuited to the account which the author of the Dabistan has given of these deities. From all these facts, I think it probable that the description given in the Dabistan of the religion of the inhabitants of Persia, before Zoroaster, either refers to a period prior to Houshung, and describes the idolatry of the deevesf whom he destroyed, or is taken from the account of the religious ceremonies and worship of a Sabian sect. If we do not adopt one of these opinions, we must conclude that it is an invention: and that would hardly appear possible, as we cannot discover what purpose such a finished fable of idolatrous superstition could be meant to answer. By placing this worship anterior to Houshung, two radical objections against its ever having existed in Persia are removed. First, there being no trace of any * The following is a literal translation from the introduction of a paper, given me by the king's astrologer, at Shiraz, in 1800; when he did me the honour to tell my fortune :— « Praise be to that great Creator who formed earth, heaven, and the heavenly bodies; ' among whose divine works mankind appear but as a small spot. The dark Saturn, ' like a sentinel, in the seventh heaven, is attentive to his wishes. The glorious ' Jupiter, like an able judge, enthroned in the sixth heaven, is watchful of his desires: « and the bloody Mars, with his purple stained sabre, sits in the fifth heaven, the ready ' executioner of his Maker's wrathful commands. And the resplendent sun, encircled ' by a flaming crown, shines in the fourth heaven, with light that he has received from « the Almighty. The beautiful Venus, like a glad minstrel, sits in her elegant apart- « ment in the third heaven, supported by his power.

There are some circumstances that might dispose us to believe similarity of that the ancient religions of Persia and of India were connected in ^stf Pet their origin. Among other proofs in favour of this conjecture, we sia and India ' find that there was, in the early ages of both countries, an abhorrence of animal flesh, which has been preserved, to this day, by some of the highest and most respected of the casts of India. It has been noticed, that the first person in Persia who departed from this usage was the tyrant, Zohaukf, whose name is yet held in execration.]:. We may suppose, that a horror at this practice remained even after ^ It is evident, from this observation, that Herodotus composed his work from in- formation that referred to a period prior to the establishment of the religion of Zoroaster, as they certainly had temples after that event. This religion was introduced in the reign of Gushtasp, or Darius Hystaspes; and his son, Isfundear, the father of Ardisheer Dirazdust, (Artaxerxes Longimanus of the Greeks,) was the greatest propa gator of its tenets; and, consequently, a great builder of temples of fire. But it is still probable, that even in the lifetime of H.erodotus, who was born in 444 A.C., the reli gion of Zoroaster was not completely introduced into Persia; and his information was probably from those who professed the faith which that of Zoroaster ultimately sup planted. » t It has been shown, that the conquest of Persia, by Zohauk, alludes to the subjec tion of that empire to the Assyrian yoke: and it is probable that both the government and religion were subverted at the same period. + Ferdosi.^2 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . it became general; and that many humane and pious men looked back, with veneration, at the superior innocence of a former age. Birth Of Zoro- It is on this principle that we must account for the anxiety of the ^ historians of the holy Zoroaster to establish, that their prophet was produced not only without sin, but without pain or death to either the animal or vegetable creation; for the ancient Persians believed the latter, though insensible to pain or pleasure, had life, and was pervaded by the eternal Spirit, as well as the former. A Persian author has declared, that the religious among the followers of Zoroaster believe that the soul* of that holy person was created by God, and hung upon that tree from which all that is celestial has been produced. The word tree is used metaphorically, to signify the first reason or knowledge, of which all the fruit is good; and when the author sa3's the soul of Zerdosht was suspended from a tree, he only means that the soul of the prophet was a ray from the first reason; and the perfection of Zoroaster was considered, he adds, as a splendid light from the tree of knowledge. ' I have heardf,' this author observes, ' the wise and holy mobud, Serposh, declare, « that the father of Zoroaster Jiad a cow J, which, after tasting some « withered leaves that had fallen from a tree, never ate of any other: ' these leaves being her sole food, all the milk she produced was * This account of his birth is from the Dabislan, the author of which states, that he follows the Shaheristan, or Pehlivi work of, Ferzana Baharam, the son of Ferhad Yezdanee. f It is not very clear, whether the author of the Dahistan speaks here in his owa person, or of the Pehlivi writer whom he quotes : but probably the latter. X Another account says, this cow ate the soul of Zoroaster as it hung to the tree, and that it passed, through her milk, to the father of that prophet. — Persian MSS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 19' ' from them.' The father* of Zoroaster (whose name was Poor- chap.vii. shasp,) was entirely supported by this milk: and to it, in consequence, they lefer the pregnancy of his mother, whose name was Daghda-f-. The apparent object of this statement, is to prove that Zoroaster was born in innocence: and that not even vegetable life was destroyed to give him existence J. In giving a short abstract of the religion of Zoroaster, which has been very fully treated by several European authors ||, I shall pass over the dreams of Daghda which foretold the greatness of Zoroaster, while yet in the womb; as well as the journey of the prophet to heaven, where he received, from Hormuzd, the holy volume of the Zend-a-vesta, and the sacred fire; and his visit to hell, where he beheld Ahnman, or the evil spirit, release a man in whom he per ceived some good, and threaten Satan, in his own regions, with shame and ignominy: nor shall I dwell upon his retirement to the mountain of EIburz§, and his solitary devotion in a deep cave, adorned by mystical figures of the elements, the seasons, and the celestial bodies: nor upon the various miracles which he performed * The Parsees carry the genealogy of Zerdosht to Manucheher.. I read this account of the birth of their prophet to Moullah-Firoze, one of the most learned of their priests : he said it was exactly what they believed. t This word, in Shanscrit, signifies milk. * When he was born he burst out into a loud laugh, (like the prince of necroman- cers, Merlin,) and such a light shone from his body, as illuminated the whole room. This ancient tradition respecting Zoroaster, which we meet with in Persian works, is mentioned by Pliny. || Anquetil du Perron has translated the Zend-a-vesta, which is certainly the most authentic source from which we can derive information upon this subject. § His retirement is noticed by Pliny, who says, Zoroaster is reported to have lived twenty years in the deserts. vol. i. 2 c194 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.vii . to establish the truth of his religion: the principal of which were holding the sacred lire on his hand; allowing boiling metal to be poured on his body; and restoring to health, and his natural shape the favourite horse of Gushtasp, whose legs were contracted and Doctrines of drawn up into his belly. It will be sufficient to notice, in a general Zoroaster. &lt; ® manner, the leading doctrines which he propagated, the usages that he prescribed, and the essential points in which he reformed and altered the ancient worship of his country. God, he taught, existed from all eternity, and was like infinity of time and space. There were, he averred, two principles in the universe,—good and evil: the one was termed Hormuzd, which denoted the presiding agent of all that was good; and the other, Ahriman, the lord of evil. Each of these had the power of creation : but that power was exercised with opposite designs ; and it was from their coaction, that an admixture of good and evil was found in every created thing. The angels of Hormuzd, or the good principle, sought to preserve the elements, the seasons, and the human race, which the infernal agents of Ahriman desired to destroy : but the source of good alone, the great Hormuzd, was eternal; and must, therefore, ultimately pre vail*. Light was the type of the good, darkness of the evil spirit; and God had said unto Zoroaster, ' My light is concealed under all ' that shines -f' Hence, the disciple of that prophet, when he per forms his devotions in a temple, turns towards the sacred fire that burns upon its altar; and when in the open air, towards the sun, as the noblest of all lights, and that by which God sheds his divine influence over the whole earth, and perpetuates the works of his creation. Zoroaster declared to his followers, that the guardian angels of animals, and of the elements, had addressed him as follows: * Zend-a-vesta. t Zend-a-vesta.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 195 ' Guard my herds and flocks/' said the holy Bahman, ' O man chap. vti.

Ordain the mobuds, the ' dustoors, and herboods*, to preserve them, and neither to extin- ' guish them in the water, nor in the earth: bid them erect, in every ' city, a temple of fire; and celebrate, in honour of that element, the ' feasts ordained by law.

After Khourdad had finished, Amerdad said : ' 0 Zoroaster! bid ' men not destroy, nor pull, except in season, the plants and the ' fruits of the earth ; for these were meant as a support and blessing ' to man, and unto animals-f.' Zoroaster was also instructed to establish, in every place, a priest who should read the sacred volume, or the Avesta: and these were ordained to preserve pure the four elements of which man is formed; earth, air, fire, and water These were the leading principles of the religion of Zoroaster. The general maxims taught in his great work, the Zend-a-vesta, were moral and excellent, and well calculated to promote industry and virtue. That the principal tenets of the faith he taught were pure, and sublime, and that his religion inculcated the worship of one immortal and beneficent Creator, is as true as those accusations which state, that he artfully adapted his creed to the prejudices of his countrymen, and that, whatever might have been his intention, his introduction of flame from an earthly substance, as the symbol of God, opened a * ZencUa-vesta. t Zend-a-vesta. t Zend-a-vesta.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 197 wide door for superstition. There can be no doubt that the devotion chap. vii. intended for the deity of Zoroaster, has been given to the symbol by many of his followers, who have merited, by such a practice, the reproachful name of worshippers of fire. Though the Persians, before the period of Zoroaster, reverenced fire as one of the elements, we have no reason to believe that they preserved it in temples*, or addressed their devotions to it. The introduction of this usage may be deemed one of the greatest changes which that prophet made in their religion. In directing his disciples to turn to the sun, when they offered up their prayers, # The silence of Herodotus on the subject of the great revolution that had taken place in the religion of Persia, (a short period before that in which he lived,) has been before noticed. It appears to prove, that the progress of the changes made by Zoroaster was slow. But, on looking closely at the passage which Herodotus gives us, we also discover, that he writes of the past more than the actual state of the religion of Persia. He observes, it is true, that ' he speaks from his own knowledge, when he ' states, that the Persians have neither statues, temples, nor altars7,' &amp;c. But after asserting, in the same positive manner, and in the present tense, that ' They adore the ' sun, moon, earth, fire, water, and the winds 8 ;' he adds: &lt;c But they sacrifice to ' these, only from of old, or according to ancient custom. In aftertimes, from the ' example of the Assyrians and Arabians, they added Urania to the number.' This passage appears to me to refer more to antecedent usage, than to the exact period at which Herodotus wrote. It certainly proves, that, immediately before the time of Zoroaster, the Persians worshipped the host of heaven, but not their images: conse quently, the account of these idols given in the Dabistan must either be false altoge ther, or refer to a period much more remote than that of which the Grecian historian yvrites. 7 Beloe's Herodotus, Vol. I. page 193. 8 This is a literal translation of the text, given to me by a learned friend.198 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vii. he accorded with the national belief, and that was also flattered by Mode^oiMis ^ S rea ^ veneration in which he held the elements. But the obedi- posing of the ence w hich he paid to the angel Espendermad, who bade him not dead. soil the earth with carcasses, led him to change some part of the usages of the ancient Persians in respect to the disposal of the dead. According to Herodotus, the Persians used to inter their dead^: but the corpse was not buried till the flesh had been eaten by dogs and birds. It is the practice of the followers of Zoroaster to expose the carcasses of their dead on the tops of cemeteries, built ' where neither ' man nor water passeth :' and when the flesh is eaten off by birds, or wasted by exposure, the bones, instead of being separately interred, * Many vases full of human bones have been recently discovered. Several were dug out of a mound near Abusheher when I was residing at that place; and I was told the same kind of vases were found in different parts of Persia. Those which I saw, were of a size that could not have contained the body of a full grown person: but, as the skele tons were complete, the flesh had evidently either been cut or eaten off: and this usage seems illustrated by the following remarkable passage in Herodotus: — ' They have other customs,' that author observes; ' concerning which, as they are ' of a secret nature, I will not pretend to express myself decisively: as to what relates ' to their dead, I will not affirm it to be true, that these never are interred, till some « bird, or dog, has discovered a propensity to prey on them. This, however, is un- ' questionably certain of the Magi, who publicly observe this custom. The Persians « first enclose the dead body in wax, and afterwards place it in the ground.' It is to be remarked, that though Herodotus, in this passage, states, that the dead body before interment was wrapped in wax, it is probable that this was only the usage of the rich. The lower orders would, to avoid expense, naturally substitute clay; and earthen vessels, for such purposes, would be manufactured. The vases that have been discovered, could evidently never have contained more than the bones: and, conse. quently, the flesh must either have been consumed by dogs or birds in the manner described, or been allowed to waste away previous to interment.■SIA. ;l 7 'Noflefei fed 1 ; in THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 199 as formerly, are thrown into a great cavity in the centre of the chap. vii. common sepulchre. Zoroaster, we are informed, was a great astrologer; and, from his knowledge of the heavenly bodies, could calculate nativities, and foretell events; and this knowledge has descended to the priesthood of his followers: but it would fill a volume to describe every stone of the structure he reared. He had presiding angels over each month, and over every day: the names and duties of these, and of a host of genii, are detailed in his works. The religion which he introduced, was disturbed, after his death, by a thousand schisms. Those of Mani, and of Mazdak, have been noticed. The last great reform, or rather re-establishment of the original orthodox doctrines of Zoroaster, took place in the reign of Ardisheer Babigan, the founder of the Sassanian dynasty; and the rites ordained by the chief mobuds* under his reign, are still observed by the followers of this religion. We now proceed to an examination of the authorities on which the facts connected with the history of ancient Persia are grounded. Kaiomurs, who, according to the authority of the Dabistan, was only the first king of the fifth dynasty of the monarchs of Persia, was considered f, by the followers of Zoroaster, as the first created being: and Mahomedan writers, who follow the Jewish chronology, # Mobud appears to be the ancient Persian name of a priest. That of dustoor, which is now a more common appellation, is evidently derived from the Arabic. t This is stated on the authority of the translation of the Zend-a-vesta, by D'Anquetil du Perron. The name of Kaiomurs, as written by that author, appears to be a Shanscrit word, and signifies « body of clay.' He is termed Gil Shah, or « king of clay,' by all Persian authors, which is evidently a translation of the term in the Zend-a-vesta.200 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . trace his descent to Noah, but term him the first sovereign of that kingdom. We learn from every cotemporary historian, that the followers of the prophet of Arabia were so irritated by the obstinacy with which the Persians defended their independance and religion, that they destroyed, with bigoted fury, all that could keep alive a spirit they found it so difficult to subdue: cities were razed; temples were burnt; the holy priests that officiated in them were slaughtered; and the Destruction of books, in which were written whatever the learned of the nation cordTtfTer- knew, either of general science, or of their own history and religion, si!u were, with their possessors, devoted to destruction. The enthusiastic Arabian, of this era, knew, and desired to know, no book but the Koran. The priests of the Persians, who were termed mujous* or magi, were all considered as sorcerers, and their profane works were viewed as the implements of their wicked art. For a proof of this feeling, we have only to refer to the popular tales of Arabia, where we find every act of wickedness, or of witchcraft, is the deed of a Gueber, or Gaurf; and that term, which means no more than a follower of Zoroaster, has, from the impressions it excited at the dawn of their religion, become synonimous with the reproachful epithet of infidel over the whole Mahomedan world. We may judge from the fate of the accumulated manuscripts of Greece and Rome, how few of the works of a conquered and despised * This comes from the Persian word mugh, which means an infidel priest: gene rally applied to the priests of the Guebers, hnt sometimes to Christians.

Near four centuries elapsed before any great effort was made to rescue what remained of the books of the ancient Persians from the ruin to which they had been devoted. The first attempt of this kind is ascribed to a prince Attemptmade of the race of Saman: and as that family boasted their descent 'ZZlToT from Baharam Choubeen, we are, perhaps, as much indebted to them ' their vanity, as their love of knowledge, for the recovery of materials which they, no doubt, sought, from a desire of per petuating the fame of their ancestors. We know, from sacred history, that the deeds of the kings of Persia were written in a work styled the Chronicles of that kingdom: and we are told by a Grecian author*, who was at the Court of Artaxerxes Mnemon, that he had access to volumes which were preserved in the royal archives. Mahomedan authors state, that scattered portions of this They are work, which had been preserved by the mobuds, or priests, of the Guebers, were collected f, and given to the poet, Dukiki, who was kiki ' t0 foTm into an epic commanded to form the whole into an epic poem, which should p 06111, contain the history of the kings of Persia, from Kaiomurs to the death of the unfortunate Yezdijird. Dukiki only lived to write a thousand stanzas of this great work. He was assassinated by one of * Ctesias. f Authors differ with regard to the name of the Satnanian prince, to whom this act is ascribed. D'Ohsson ascribes the commencement of the collection to Munsoor the First; and its completion, to the second king of that name. Tahir Mahomed states, that Dukiki actually commenced his poem under the auspices of Ismael, the founder of the Samanian dynasty; while the poet, Jami, with more probability of truth, asserts, that Dukiki lived in the time of Noah, the fourth king of that race. vol. i. 2d9 Introduction to Ferhung Jehangheree. www*- * None of these fragments are left. When the purpose for which they were col lected was so completely answered, and the Shah Namah became, as it soon did, the standard volume of the nation, it was natural that the unconnected and scanty materials from which it was formed, should lose their value. A reference to them might have diminished, but could not heighten, the tale of glorj' which Ferdosi had told. That national vanity, therefore, which had produced this collection, was no longer interested in its preservation. It is also probable that these manuscripts were, if preserved at all, deposited in the royal archives of the monarchs of Ghizni: and, if so, they must have been involved in that terrible destruction, which fell on all that belonged to that proud capital, when it was sacked and burnt by the Affghans, of Ghour. f We are informed, by what are deemed the best Persian authorities, that when the Arabs invaded that country, they found three languages, the Farsee, Deri, and the Pehlivi; from one or other of which, all the various dialects now spoken in Persia are derived9. There were, according to some authors, seven languages in Persia: but the Herowee, the Suckzee, the Zawulee, and Suodee (now obsolete), appear to have been 202 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . his own slaves: and the task, fortunately for the fame of his country devolved upon Ferdosi, who, under the auspices of the celebratprl He is assassi- cu nated, and the Mahmood, of Ghizni, composed, from the materials that had been task devolves on ferdosi. before brought together, and from what his own industry could add the celebrated poem, entitled ' The Shah Namah, or Book of ' Kings:' and in his page, clouded as it is by fable, and ornamented by poetic fancy, we meet with almost all that the Asiatic world know Of the ancient history of Persia, and of Tartary. The fragments* from which this poem is taken, were in Pehlivi; which appears, at the period of the Mahomedan conquest, to have been the language in which all but the religious works of the Persians were written-)-: and it is of great importance to observe, that theTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. SOU Shah Namah contains so many Pehlivi words, that it cannot be chap . vn. understood by a modern Persian without a glossary: while Arabic words and phrases, which long before the period of Ferdosi had been generally adopted into the Persian language, are studiously rejected. The poet, indeed, boasts of having excluded them from his work- and his making this boast is of itself sufficient to satisfy our belief, that w.th whatever ornament his imagination may have adorned his' tale, the facts are exclusively taken from Pehlivi records. mere vulgar dialeets: they were never written: and Monllah Mahomed Saadoek (in whose introduction to a dietionary of the aneient Fars there is a short aeeount of the ormer languages of Persia,) asserts, that ' a word from any of these tongues would ' have, destroyed a stanza.' The Pars, or Farsee, is still (though nmeh mi X ed with Arahie since the Mahomedau conquest,) the general language of the kingdom. The Den, we are told, was a polished language, spoken in some of the principal cities of the empire, and believed by some to have been the conrt dialect during the period of the Kaianian dynasty » The word Deri implies eloqnen, and is meant to express that in which there is no imperfection. As a proof of the sweetness and elegance of this .alect we have a tradit.on from Mahomedau authors, that their prophet declared, that if God had a mandate to issue which was to proclaim his goodness and mercy, he wonld deliver it in a geutle tone, and in the Deri language: but when he speaks in wrath added Mahomed, he uses the Arabic tongue. They assert, on the same authority' that Den and Arabic are the only languages spoken in Paradise. The third language' is the Pehlivi; a word to which many meanings have been assigned: but the most probable conjecture is, that it was derived from Pehleh, the ancient name of the countries of Isfahan, Rhl, and Deenawar'. The Znnd is the holy language in which the Zend-a-vesta of Zoroaster is written: and his followers affirm, that it can only be known to God, angels, prophets, and enlightened priests'. The sacred volume is in this language, but has a Pehlivi translation annexed. 10 Moullah Mahomed Saaduck's MSS. 12 Moullah Firoze's MSS.304 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vii. The Greeks take no notice of the Paishdadian dynasty of monarchs. Ferdosi's account of this race, therefore, merits particular Ferdosi's ac count of the attention.

His son, Tahamurs, was engaged in constant wars with the deeves, or magicians, which is the name given by the poet to all The above is the account which we receive from eastern writers of the ancient languages (as they term them) of Persia; but if we may reason from analogy, and from the history of other nations, we shall be led to conclude, that most of these were only different dialects of one tongue, which, in the course of ages, underwent many and great changes. The Zund, which approximates nearest to the Shanscrit, may cer tainly be deemed the most ancient of these dialects or languages; for in the earliest periods of which we have any authentic record, it was the language of the learned and religious. Some of the followers of Zoroaster have ascribed its invention to their prophet: but this is impossible; and the existence of such a belief proves nothing more, than that, in his lifetime, it was a language unknown to the vulgar. The Pehlivi was, according to Ferdosi, the language of the court in the time of the Kaianian dynasty ; and probably for a long period afterwards. It is to be observed, that, except the religious works of Zoroaster and others, all the books written in Persia, before the Mahomedan invasion, were in Pehlivi: but we never hear of a Den manuscript; a fact which makes it evident, that this term was only used to signify the most polished dialect spoken of the common language of the country: and it might, in that sense, equally apply to the Pehlivi, as to the Parsi, or Persian. The latter term, previous to the Mahomedan invasion, probably meant the lan guage commonly spoken : for, even at that period, all the books appear to have been written in Pehlivi. The Farsi, or Persian language, has been subsequently rendered more copious: and, in its present form, is so mixed with the Pehlivi and Arabic, that it'is no easy labour to separate the words that belong to the different languages of which it is constructed.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 205 the enemies of this dynasty. A moderate period is assigned to the chap . vir. reign of each of these three kings; Ferdosi making it only one hundred and ten years, from the accession of Kaiomurs to that of the nephew and successor of Tahamurs, the celebrated Jemsheed. The reign of this monarch was, according to Ferdosi, seven jemsheed. hundred years*. Authors, however, differ as to the length of his reign: but all that is related of Jemsheed is evidently fabulous. It is the history of a period in which considerable changes took place in the state of society. First, we are told, that this prince divided his subjectsf into four classes, and that he allotted to each a Divides his separate and fixed station in life; which seems to imply, that the ^fdLses! condition of the ancient Persians was like that of the modern Hindoos, and that the extraordinary institution of cast, which now exists in India, was once known in Persia. This theory merits investigation, and might be supported by many arguments : but there are some against such a conclusion, which appear very forcible. Neither Greek J nor Persian historians state any one * Some authors reduce the reign of Jemsheed to one hundred and fifty years. D'Ohsson (on what authority I know not,) terras it three hundred and fifty. I fix it at seven hundred, from the agreement of four copies of the Shah Namah: and this agrees with the Calcutta printed edition of that work, which is collated from a great number of copies. t The first division of men into classes is, by all Mahomedan authors except Mohsin Fani, ascribed to Jemsheed That author, as has been noticed, refers this act to Mahabad. X Strabo, when speaking of Iberia, informs us, that « four kinds or classes of « people inhabited that country. From what they consider the first class,' he observes, ' they appoint their kings, according to nearness of kindred and seniority : these admi- ' nister justice, and bead their armies. The second is of priests, who take charge of206 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAP. VII. fact, in the ancient history of Persia, which proves the existence 0 f castj as we understand that term in its application to the Hindoos. We meet with no more than the names of the classes into which Jemsheed divided the Persians; and Ferdosi, who is minute in his description both of the country and of the manners of its in habitants, after having once mentioned the divisions of the people into classes, never again recurs to the subject. It would appear very difficult, if not impossible, to write the history of a Hindoo nation, without many passages that would mark the existence among that race of this extraordinary institution. Some Maho- medan authors, it is true, go further than Ferdosi* in their account ' their political rights, with respect to their neighbours. The third of soldiers and ' husbandmen. The fourth of the people in general; who are slaves of the king, and ' perform every menial office.' But it is obvious, that these distinctions, which prevail in Circassia at the present day, are merely feudal, like the western divisions of nobles, clergy, free peasants, and bondsmen. # In almost every copy of Ferdosi that I have consulted, the names of the classes into which Jemsheed divided his subjects, are differently written. The following literal translation of his account of these classes, is from the copy of that work published at Calcutta:— ' One class was called Kanoozean : ' They were acquainted with holy worship. ' He separated this class from the others; ' Made a mountain their place of devotion : ' Know, that religion was their occupation; ' Reading before the splendour of the Almighty. «■ Another rank was placed on the opposite hand : ' They were called the Nesareean. « Wherever lion-hearted men were waging war,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. of these classes, and state that Jemsheed directed that the persons chap. he classified should confine themselves to their own occupation. But this general assertion cannot, without other evidence, be admitted as a proof of so important a fact in a nation's history as the division of casts. That the Persians were, during that period which is included in the reign of Jemsheed, divided into the four classes mentioned by Ferdosi, is very probable: but this merely implies, that they were reclaimed from a savage state, and separated into those natural ' These were the brilliant army of the kingdom: ' From them the imperial throne had its stability ; ' And from them the name of valour is perpetuated. ' Know, the Nesoodee as the third class. ' There is no place in which they are not praised. ' They sow, they labour, and they reap themselves; ' And at their home they hear no reproach. Not subject to command, they wear their coarse garments : ' Their ears are never assailed with calumny : ' The y enjoy repose from control and strife : « Their's is health of body, and the health of the earth is from them. « Tell me, thou that art intelligent, who uttered this saying, ' 1 Indolence makes a slave of the free.' ' The fourth are called Anokhushee: ' They ply the handicraft arts stubbornly: ' Wherever there is work, they are always active : ' Their mind is fixed on its accomplishment.' The division made by Jemsheed is recorded in the Binidad, a Pehlivi work, and Moullah Firoze gives the names of the four classes as mentioned in that work. Asurinan, the priests; aretishtaran, kings and soldiers; wasterjushan, cultivators; hutokhshan,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. divisions of society that were suited to the more civilized condition into which they were brought. And, after all, this is only one among a thousand improvements which are ascribed to that prince in the fabulous history they give of his long reign. He built cities; he invented arms; he constructed ships; he turned the attention of the nation to agriculture; he reformed the calendar, and taught men the noble science of astronomy; he was the first that made wine, that ma nufactured silk, and introduced music: and, to finish all, he became so vain of his perfections, and so intoxicated with power, that he declared workmen. Of the meaning of the two first names I cannot obtain a satisfactory account. I am told that they are zend and pazend. But waster, m Pehhvi, means grain, or grass; and in the same language hu means good, and tokhsha endeavour, striving, which seems sufficiently to explain the etymology of the two last. In the Burhan Kuttah the divisions are also given: and from the great learning of the author, and the nature of a glossary, or dictionary, in which the arrangement would help to correct a mistake probably with accuracy, it merits much reliance. The meaning of the names of all the classes is given in that work, under the article Katuzi. ' Katuzi,' the author states, « means a man of piety, an ecclesiastic. It « must be remarked,' he continues, ' that Jemsheed divided the race of man into four « c l ass es: one he called katuzi, and directed them to dwell in hills and in caverns, and « to employ themselves in the worship of Almighty God, and in learning, and know- ' ledge. The second he called nesSiri, and directed them to follow war as their occu- « pation. Another he called nasudi, and enjoined them to cultivate and reap the ' ground. The last he called anokhushi, and ordered them to ply the handicraft arts.' The author of the Tarikh Tubree gives an account of this division of the inhabitants of Persia by Jemsheed, into what he terms gooroo, or classes. He calls the first religious and wise men : the second, military : the third, tradesmen and artisans: and the fourth, husbandmen and labourers. He adds, that Jemsheed commanded that every man should confine himself to his own occupation. Khondemir also states, that each class was prohibited from engaging in the occupations of the other; and Mirkha- vund Shah says the same thing.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ himself a god, made images of his person, and denounced vengeance chap . vn. on all who did not fall down and worship them.

Persia, after enjoying a period of unexampled prosperity*, was invaded and conquered by a foreign prince, the savage Zohauk, Persiainvaded whose cruelty and oppression spread terror and desolation over that byZohauk - kingdom. May we not, without presumption, conclude that this is a general account of a people's history for a certain period? It describes their emerging from a savage state, in which men have few wants, and consequently few distinctions, either in rank or occupa tion ; their division into the classes of a more civilized commu nity ; their becoming industrious, rich, and prosperous; their laps ing into a state of luxury and irreligion ; and, consequently, falling an easy conquest to a foreign enemy. This seems a plain interpretation of the history of Jemsheed, as related by Persian authors. It would be much more difficult to explain that ot his conqueror, Zohauk, if we had no other light than that which eastern authors afford to guide us through this dark era of their history. They state, that Zohauk was descended from Shedadf, a iii s descent, prince of Syria, and that he ruled Persia about one thousand years J. Of this period, they give us nothing except a few fabulous anec dotes: but there is reason to conclude, from the testimonies of * Persian authors, to figure this prosperity, say, that pain and death were banished from the earth during the first five centuries of his reign. t They may allude to the Ben-hadad of the Scriptures, who was one of the most iamous of the kings of Syria; and who, we are told, was worshipped by the inhabit ants of that country. — Shedad is believed, by oriental writers, to have proclaimed him- self a g od - t Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. vol. i. 2 e210 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . western writers, that Zohauk was the Assyrian monarch who con- quered Persia, and that his long reign includes that part of ancient history in which the latter kingdom was subject to Assyria. The Assyrian The duration of the Assyrian power in Persia, according to Grecian writers, occupies nearly the same space of time as that which eastern authors assign to Zohauk *; and the Persians admit that their country was, during the whole of this period, under a foreign rule. Some of the finest structures in Persia have been ascribed to the sovereigns of the Assyrian empire, and particularly to their queen, Semiramis: but we must refrain from conjectures regarding the works of one whose existence is doubted by some authors, and respecting the date of whose reign, the most learned chronologists are not agreed within fifteen centuries-f*. Feridoon, the If we admit that the period of Z oh auk's reign was that in which Greeks. 8 Persia was subject to the Assyrians, we must suppose that the Eeri- doon of the Persian historians is the Arbaces of the Greeks.

Arbaces, the Mede, was induced, by the contemptible character of Sardanapulus, to attack Nineveh, which he took, and overthrew the Assyrian monarchy. Some Persian authors state, that Feridoon took Zohank in Jerusalem: but this is evidently a mistake, as appears from a passage in Ferdosi, who describes Nineveh as the city he subdued. Another Persian author confirms this account, and gives the name of the real capital, stating that the Assyrian monarch sometimes resided at it, and sometimes at Babylon. Moses, of Chorone, calls this king Varbaces*: and the history he gives of his youth accords, in some degree, with Persian authors: but the strong fact of his having freed his countrymen from the Assyrian yoke, is that on which the conclusion of Arbaces and Feridoon being the same person must rest. The sacred Scripture seldom gives details of the history of any nation except the Israelites: but it seems surprising that the Greeks should give us no account of the fables connected with the birth and education of Feridoon: nor do we receive from them any particulars of those events that led the Medes to throw off the Assyrian yoke; and it is here of importance to remark, that there is no passage in all the ancient history of Persia more fully proved from the page of oriental writers, than the revolt of K4w4h, the blacksmith, who placed Feridoon upon the throne of that kingdom. The gratitude that The D^fs,. converted his apron into the standard of an empire, and the almost e ' Ka ™ ee - sacred respect in which it was held for centuries, are proofs of the character of that service, the memory of which was perpetuated by * He also calls him Khodarnis.212 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . so great a distinction; while the actual capture of the Durufsh-e- Kawanee, or standard* of K&amp;w&amp;h, by the general of the Caliph Omar in the fourteenth year of the Hejirah, must satisfy the most sceptical of the truth of this early part of Persian history.

Xenophon states^ that the royal ensign was a golden eagle, with its wings resting upon a spear: and Quintus Curtius describes it as continuing to be the same in the time of Alexander. But the Persians having a figure of an eagle as an ensign, is no reason for concluding, that the standard of K&amp;w&amp;h did not also exist. There must have been a royal ensign, or standard, before the service was rendered which led to the adoption of the apron of Kawah: and that, probably, was the eagle described. We learn from Persian historians, that the sacred banner of K&amp;,w&amp;h was sejdom unfurled. And this is a collateral reason that there must have been other royal ensigns in more common use. f The history of his sons, Selm, Toor, and Erij, has been given. J Both the Scripture and the Greek writers distinguish, throughout this period, the kingdom of the Medes from that of Persia: but eastern authors speak only of Eeran, which is what I translate Persia: as to Fars proper, there can be no doubt but it was, under Feridoon (Arbaces), and all powerful monarchs, but a province of the general empire, which extended over both what western writers term Media and Persia. H Feridoon was succeeded, agreeably to Ferdosi, by his great grandson, Manucheher. Mirkhond terms him his son. This prince is the Mandauces of the Greek writers. His son, Nouzer, is Sosarmus. Zoo, who was placed upon the throne by Zal, when the Scythians were masters of a great part of Persia, is called Artia by the Greeks; who state, that he was the grandson of Mandauces. The Kershasp of the Persians they term Arbianes. There are few events recorded of any of these princes: and the chief correspondence between the Greek and Persian writers in this portion of ancient history is, that each reckons five princes, from the overthrow of the Assyrian empire, to the election of Dejoces, or Kai Kobad.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. olc Duruf^. j 2U ^ Calipl themselves masters of Persia, of which country they held possession, chap. vii. f tliemost according to Persian historians, for a period of twelve years*.

His materials were slender: and he had to adapt the story, that he made from them, to the prejudices and the limited knowledge* of his countrymen, who were only familiarly acquainted with those regions to which he has confined the chief actors of his drama. It is from this cause that we find events, which occurred on the banks of the Euphrates, often transferred to those of the Oxus; and while one stanza describes a great expedition into Greece, a hundred pages are devoted to an inroad into Persia of a few freebooters from the plains of Tartary. Though the history of Roostum and his family is enveloped in fable, there are some facts that seem undoubted. First, that they were the hereditary chiefs or princes of Seistan, or Nimroz: secondly, that they were connected with the royal family of Cabul, as well as that of Persia^: and thirdly, that though they never assumed the title of kings, and had always kept a pageant of the royal blood upon the throne, they had been acknowledged and obeyed as rulers of a great province, and as the leaders of the armies of Persia, from the death of Manucheher, the Mandauces of the Greeks, till the * It is not likely that Ferdosi had, among his materials, many detailed accounts of the western wars of the Persians : but, if he had, the relation of the actions of Grecian warriors would have been altogether uninteresting to the vanity and pride of his coun trymen.

We are told by Herodotus, that Dejoces was elected king on account of his reputation for wisdom and justice, when Persia was in a state of great weakness and anarchy. They called a public assembly, this author informs us, to deliberate on national affairs ■ and they who were attached to Dejoces delivered themselves to the o owing effect:-' Our present situation is altogether intolerable: et us, therefore, elect a king, that we may have the advantage of a regular government, and continue our usual occupations without ' fear or danger of molestation f.' After this prelude, Dejoces was proposed, and chosen with universal applause. That sovereign, the same writer adds, built a magnificent palace, fortified his capital and endeavoured, by the establishment of great state and pomp, and the seclusion of the royal person, to impress his subjects with a respect and awe that would, he conceived, add to the strength of the monarchy. Ferdosi, in his account of the elevation of Kai Kobad to the throne, remarks, that Zal, the Prince of Seistan, and father of • Ferdosi does not inform us who was the father of Kai Kobad, but merely states, that he was of the royal blood, and descended from Manncheher. But if he was the Dejoces of the Greeks, and the son, as Herodotus states, of Phraortes, that poet would hardly have found, in the chronicles of Persia, the name of the Median prince who conquered their country. C.esias, who professedly drew from the same source as Ferdost, does not mention Phraortes; which may be received as a proof that it was not to be found in Persian records. + Beloe's Herodotus, Vol. I. p I49 vii.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . Roostum, who commanded the Persian army, assembled all the chiefs of the nation, and addressed them as follows' Brave ' warriors! instructed by experience, and lessoned by dangers, I ' have brought together this army, and endeavoured to render it ' formidable: but all hearts are discouraged, from the want of a ' prince to preserve union.

After this speech, Kai Kobad was named, and universally approved. Remarkable The remarkable concurrence of Ferdosi and Herodotus, with betweenHe- regard to the circumstances that attended the elevation of Dejoces, Ferdosl ^ or Kai Kobad, to the throne of Persia, must tend to strengthen our belief of the facts which they both record. The difference of the name given to this king by these authors, is comparatively of small consequence. Kings of Persia had, no doubt, in ancient, as in modern times, several names, or rather appellations, that have been used indiscriminately during their life, and after their death; and, when we add to this fact the corruptions of the varied languages through which their history has passed before it reached us, we cannot be surprised at our almost never meeting with an agreement on this point between Grecian and Persian historians. The correspondent facts in these histories, are the only lights we can expect to guide us.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 217 with tolerable safety, through this dark and intricate period, and chap. are to be esteemed far above dates, which, with reference to the history of Persia before the Mahomedan conquest, are, perhaps, less to be depended upon than the uncertain etymology * of proper names, or assumed titles: but, even with reference to these, we have a strong proof of Kai Kobad and Dejoces being the same person. One Mahomedan authorf terms this monarch Arsh: and Ctesias, who writes from the authority of Persian records, calls him Arsaeces, which is evidently the same name. We are told by Herodotus, that Dejoces was succeeded by a son, who was also named Phraortes; and he ascribes to that Median prince the conquest of Persia. This monarch is not noticed by Ferdosi; he probably includes his reign in that of his father, who, he informs us, occupied the throne for more than a century J. One Mahomedan historian ||, however, notices the second Phraortes. * It has been asserted, that the Arphaxad mentioned in the book of Jadith, was the Dejoces of the Greeks, because he is said to have built Ecbatana : and if we were to conjecture from etymology, we should conclude that this prince was Dejoces Arpha, or Arphra, is the same as Phraortes; and xad, or Z ad, means, in ancient as in modern Persian, son; and Arpbaxad might therefore be interpreted the son of Phra ortes. Ferdosi says, Kai Kobad was considered as a descendant of Feridoon ; or, as it would be written in Pehlivi, Phrcedoon, or in the Deri, Aphreedoon, a nam'e not dissimilar to Aphra: and in this view, also, the Arphaxad of the book of Judith would appear to be the Kai Kobad of the Persians: but nothing can be more uncertain than conclusions drawn only from etymology, f The author of the Mujmah-ul-Tuarikh. t In the Calcutta edition of Ferdosi, Kai Kobad is said to have reigned one hun dred and twenty years. || The author of the Mujmah-ul-Tuarikh. Mirkhond also states, that some authors believe Kai Kaoos to have been the grandson, not the son, of Kai Kobad. vol. i. 2 f vii. jSi»218 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vn. This author, speaking of Kai Kaoos, who, in the page of Ferdosi, is stated to be the son and successor of Kai Kobad, observes; ' Some « historians are positive that Kai Kaoos was the son of Aphra, and ' grandson of Kai Kobad; but I believe him to have been the son of « the latter.' This is sufficient to show that the name of this king of the Medes is familiar to eastern writers, although he has been excluded, by most Persian authors, (who generally copy Ferdosi,) from the list of kings that intervened between Feridoon and Kai Khoosroo. There is every reason to conclude, that the history of Kai Kaoos, as we read it in the page of Ferdosi, is that of both Cyaxares and Astyages. Herodotus informs us, that the former made war upon the Lydians, and extended his dominions to the west, as far as the river Halys*: he also states, that in the midst of a battle between the Medes and Lydians, a total eclipse of the sun took place, as had been foretold by Thales, of Miletus. Cyaxares afterwards, according to this author, attacked Nineveh, to revenge the death of his father, but was recalled from this expedition, to save his own country from an invasion of the Scythians. Of Astyages little is recorded by Greek writers, except that he married Aryenis, daughter of Alyattes, King of Lydia, when his father concluded a peace with that monarch. It has been before stated, that this is the period of his history in which Ferdosi indulges most in fable: but we nevertheless can dis cover facts in his page, that completely correspond with the general tenor of what Herodotus has recorded. The most remarkable agree ment, is in the expedition of Kai Kaoos to Mazenderan. We are told * This river is described as rising in the mountains of Armenia.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 219 by the Persian poet, that in a battle which was fought in that province, chap vn the prince and his army were struck with a sudden blindness*, which had been foretold by a magician. This evidently appears to be the echpse predicted by Thales. Ferdosi, it is true, informs us, that the event led to Kai Kaoos and his follower, being made prisoners: but this is a mere poetical fiction, invented to introduce the wonderful achievements of his hero, Roostum ; who, by the efforts of his single arm, is made to subdue a number of demons, and the whole of that army which had defeated his sovereign; whom he not only releases, but enables to conquer the country he invaded: and the result of this war, which extended the empire in the direction of the Halys is in perfect agreementf with the success of Cyaxares, as described by Herodotus. The expedition against HamaverJ, mentioned in the Shah Namah, seems to be the siege of Nineveh, recorded bv f~*i i • j i . J ver seems to eek writers, who agree with Ferdosi in stating, that the operations ^ e . tl,e siege or were interrupted by an invasion of the Scythians: and the account N ' ,e,eh ' Herodotus gives of the marriage of Astyages to the daughter of the Prince of Lydia, corresponds with the Persian author, who informs us of the marriage of Kai Kaoos with the daughter of the King of Hamaver. I have before stated, that it is evident Ferdosi gives an account of the two reigns of Cyaxares and Astyages under one head. • I am indebted to a manuscript memoir of my learned friend, Mr. Hamilton one of the professors in Hertford College, for this striking observation of the coincidenee between Herodotus and Ferdosi, in the account of the eclipse. t Persian anthors have no knowledge of the geography of any country but their own; and, therefore, we can never expect any accurate account of the conquests of their sovereigns, when these exceed limits with which they are familiar. t There is hardly a doubt that the Hamaver of Ferdosi is the capital of Assyria.220 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vii.

The minister gave the boy to a shepherd, with directions to slay him: but the shepherd, in consequence of the solicitations of his humane wife, not only preserved the young prince, but took care that his education should be suitable to his birth. After the lapse of some years, this deception was discovered by Astyages, who, though he desisted from his intention of destroying his grandson, punished the neglect of Harpagus, by putting to death the son of that minister. The young Cyrus went to Persia: but Harpagus, who, in secret, continued to cherish the deepest resentment against the cruel Astyages, formed a plot to dethrone that sovereign, and to elevate his grandson. The latter, informed of his design, succeeded in exciting the Persians to revolt, and marched against Ecbatana. The King of the Medes placed his treacherous minister in the command of his army, most of whom went over, accompanied by their leader, to Cyrus, the moment that prince appeared; and the consequence of this defection was the easy reduction of the capital, and the overthrow of the Median empire. Astyages, we learn from the same authority, continued to reside at the court of his grandson and conqueror Ctesias calls Astyages Aspadan*; and tells us, Cyrus was not According to his descendant, but had married his daughter, Amytis, after he had €tesias ' dethroned him.

According to Xenophon, Cyrus was the son of Xenophon. . i Cambyses, whom he denominates a Persian prmce ot the race of the Perseedae, or descendants of Persus. His mother, we are told by this writer, was Mandane, the daughter of Astyages, King of Media; and he asserts, that Cyrus, when yet a youth, brought an army of Persians to aid his maternal uncle, whose name was Cyaxares the Second, in a war with the King of Assyria, and that the great conquests of Cyrus were made during the reign of his uncle, whose daughter he married, and who early named him his successor.

Ctesias says * It has been conjectured that Xenophon makes Cyrus die in his bed, that he might give his name to a philosophical discourse upon death. f We are informed by Herodotus, that Cyrus, by the stratagem of leaving them wines, with which they became intoxicated, defeated the army of the Massagetae, and made the prince of this tribe, who were then ruled by their queen Tomyris, a prisoner. Tomyris, when she heard that her troops were overcome, and her son a captive, sent the following message to the conqueror:—' Cyrus, insatiable as you are of blood, be not ' too much elated with your recent success. When you yourself are overcome with wine, ' what follies do you not commit ? By entering your bodies, it renders your language ' more insulting.

He narrates the fables which the Per-' sums themselves believed, informing us of the authority on which be records them. It .s from these, as connected with the life of Cyrus, that we are enabled to identify this prince with the Kai Khoosroo of oriental writers. I deem the Persian account of the end of Cyrus, as not materially at variance with his being killed in a war with the Massagetae. The great monarch and prophet could not be permitted to fall in battle, and to be defeated. He retires to an unknown place and is lost; or, in other words, dies,' or is slam, in a distant country : and his companions, the first heroes of Persia, perish in a storm on their return. They probably were slain in the retreat. * According to all the historians of Alexander, Cyrus was buried at Passargada;: and that monarch, we are informed, ordered the tomb, which had been defaced, to be repaired. The Persian inscription, which told the traveller not to envy the mighty conqueror his small portion of dust, was translated into Greek, and engraven in that language, under the original inscription. The following account of the visit of Aristo- bulos to the tomb, is from Strabo. » There (at Passargad^) he saw the tomb of Cyrus 'ma garden. It was a tower of no great size, concealed within a thick grove of trees; ' solid below, but roofed above, and having a chapel, with a very narrow entrance' ' Ar.stobnlus entered, by the order of Alexander, and contributed some embellishments ' to the tomb.

Daniel had foretold his success to Belshazzar, son of Nebuchadnezzar; and the prophet was afterwards minister both to Darius, the Mede, and to Cyrus; to whom his countrymen not only owed their release from captivity, but the restoration of a great part of the sacrilegious plunder which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple of Jerusalem ; which edifice, Cyrus, when he restored its ornaments, commanded to be rebuilt. Little more is given of the history of Cyrus in sacred writ: but wherever his name is mentioned, it is as a king who was alike eminent for wisdom and virtue, and who enjoyed great renown and extensive dominion upon the earth.

He was chap . va. compelled, they add, by the intrigues of the Persian court, to fly to Afrasiab, the King of Turan, whose daughter he married, and by whom he was afterwards slain. He left a son called Kai Khoosroo, whom Afrasiab resolved also to put to death; lest, when he attained manhood, he should revenge the death of his father: but the cruel mtention of the monarch was defeated by the humanity of his minister, Peeran-Wisa, who preserved the child he had been com manded to destroy; and having, for the purpose of concealment, committed the royal infant to the charge of a shepherd, he directed that he should receive, in secret, an education suitable to his high birth. Afrasiab some time afterwards discovered that his grandson was alive; but having been persuaded that he was an idiot, he abandoned his intention of destroying him. The young prince soon effected his escape to the court of his grandfather, Kai Kaoos, and was placed upon the throne of Persia during the lifetime of that monarch. The first act of his reign was to make war upon his maternal grandfather, the King of Turan, whose armies were commanded by the minister to whom Kai Khoosroo owed his life. The virtuous Peeran-Wisa was unable to resist a powerful prince, animated by the desire of revenging the blood of his father. He was defeated, and slain; and his death proved a prelude to that of his sovereign, whose territories fell into cumstance of his being nurtured by a simnrgh* The whole story of Siawash, as given by Ferdosi, conveys more the impression of his being a son of Roostum, than of Kai Kaoos. 16 The Greeks term it an eagle.

Kai Khoosroo, after this conquest, and many other great achievements*, determined to spend the remainder of his life in religious retirement. He proceeded to the spot he had fixed upon; where, we are told, he disappeared: and his train, among whom were some of the most renowned war riors of Persia, perished in a dreadful tempest. The above is a short abstract of the reign of this prince, as given by Ferdosi. It abounds with fable; and we can trace but few his torical facts. The poet has judiciously chosen a period so glorious to his country to dilate on the deeds of his heroes: and as neither he nor his readers were acquainted with Media, nor with the Babylonian, Assyrian, and Egyptian empires, except under the general names of Sham and Room, which mean Syria and Asia Minor, he makes Persia and Turan the theatre of all their actions. Taking this view of the life of Kai Khoosroo, we may pronounce, that the transfer of a scene from the court of Ecbatana to that of the capital of Afrasiab, and the substitution of the latter king for the sovereign of Media, are liberties which it was natural for the poet by whom his history was written to take, and which cannot, therefore, be admitted to affect the remarkable coincidence in the whole substance of the narrative of the birth and education of this prince, as given by Ferdosi and by Herodotus. A grandson is born to a king, who, fearful for his own safety, seeks the destruction of the infant, which he delivers to his minister to be put to death. The child is preserved by the person directed to slay him. The monarch discovers this, and consents to let him live. The young prince afterwards makes * Kai Khoosroo is said to have made many conquests, both in the East and the West; but Persian authors relate none of his actions minutely, except his wars with Afrasiab.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 227 war upon his grandfather, whose army is commanded by the chap vii very minister* who had been the instrument of his preserva- tion. He subdues the country that he attacks, and erects a proud empire upon its ruin. The Persian author, it is true, after this conquest is effected, makes Kai Khoosroo put his grandfather, Afrasiab, to death, that he may revenge his father, Siawush, whom that monarch had slain; but this, it is to be observed, ts a dramatic justice which Ferdosi could not avoid, without a sacrifice of consistency, in his description of the man ners of his heroes, all of whom he represents as inexorable-f- * The fate of Peeran-Wisa and of Harpagus is related differently in the Greek and Persian page: hut the Persian poet could not taint the fame of the first and most vir tuous of the heroes of Tartary hy the imputation of treason. He, however, makes Kai Khoosroo lament his death, and hestow upon him the most splendid funeral honours t The history of Feridoon and Manneheher is a strong proof of this: and Ferdosi makes S.awnsh, when he is on the point of death, pray, « that the son. of whom his ' widow is pregnant, may revenge his Mood.' The remarkable attention of Ferdosi to the exclusive right of the nearest relation to revenge blood, merits notice. There is in a speech of Peeran-Wisa to Afrasiab, when he reproaches that prince as the author o the calamities of his nation, an expression that strengthens the conjecture of Roostum being the father of Siawush. ' Mukosh goftumet poor e Kaoos ra, ' K e dushraun kunee Roostum ou Toos ra.' « I told you not to slay the son of Kaoos, ' As you would render Roostum and Toos your enemies.' The latter chief was the brother of Kaoos, and, therefore, nearly allied to Siawush • but Roostum could have had no particnlar right to exact vengeance for the blood of this chief, unless he was his relation: and he is evideudy described hy Peeran-Wisa, as the hero who will become, in consequence of the murder, the personal enemy' of Afrasiab.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . in avenging the blood of their relations; and in this instance also, his narrative is adapted to the feelings and usages of his country men : but, though he differs in this point, he approaches the account of Herodotus in the fact of Astyages remaining at the Court of Cyrus. Kai Kaoos, the paternal grandfather of Kai Khoosroo, is represented as having resigned the throne to that prince, and of residing, till his death, in the enjoyment of the completest regard and respect of his successor. It is certainly remarkable that Xenophon should omit every mention of the extraordinary occurrences which, according to Persian tradition, marked the youth of Cyrus: but the Cyropcedia is gene rally considered as a work more meant to display that monarch as an example* to kings, than to record the exact particulars of his life. There may be much of fable in the accounts that have been given of the early part of the life of this sovereign. But it is nowise necessary to the establishment of the fact, that the Kai Khoosroo of Persian his tory is the Cyrus of the Greeks, to prove the truth of all those events that are connected with his infancy. It is sufficient to show that they are related of one person ; and that Herodotus transmitted the same tradition, which has since been recorded by Ferdosi. Etymology of Though, in tracing the history of such remote periods, corres- edTo CyrusT' pondent facts, derived from distinct sources, have a value far beyond uncertain etymology, yet the affinity of names may often aid our research. We are told, that the name of Cyrus signified the sun in Persian: and this is the obvious signification of Coreish, which is the Hebrew name given to him in Scripture. Khour means the sun in Pehlivi: and Cyrus, before he ascended the throne, was called * The Cyropcedia has been compared to the Telemachus of Fenelon.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. A gradates*; a term which appears to be the translation of the word chap. vii. Khourdad, or the gift of the sun; the appellation of an angel in the ancient Persian system of worship, and a very probable namef for a prince of that country. With regard to the title of Kai Khoos- roo, by which he is generally called, it has been common to many sovereigns of Persia: and the dynasty of the Sassanians are always termed, in Roman history, the Cosroes, or, more properly, the Khoosroos of Persia. An oriental scholar + of respectability has endeavoured to shake Genem i ^ our belief in all that the Greek writers record of ancient Persia He nl!

This is assuredly not correct: the writers of both nations mix truth with fable, and were, perhaps, alike disposed, by national vanity, to suppress some facts, and to exaggerate others. The operation of these motives must often have rendered their account of the same event very dissimilar: and when to this we add the remoteness of the period, the want of dates, and the many different names and titles which applied to each of the kings and heroes that they have recorded, we shall, perhaps, be more surprised at their casual agreement, than at their frequent difference in the relation * Palmerius states this in his correction of Strabo. The river Kur, or Cyrus, in Georgia, is said by Ptolemy to be also called Agradates. t Mithridate, or Mithridad, has the same meaning.

The author to whom I have alluded states, that the chronology of the sacred writing has been forced into analogy with the imaginary eras of the Greeks; and adds, that some of the historical parts of Scripture will meet with much more support by comparing them with correspondent facts in Persian history. After noticing a difference of dates of nearly two centuries between the Jewish and Grecian chronology in the reign of Cyrus, he proceeds to show that a Persian chief of the name of Bucht-ul-nassar, (who, according to a respectable Mahomedan author, was sent b}^ Lohrasp, the suc cessor of Kai Khoosroo, to govern, as his lieutenant, the western part of his empire,) was the Nebuchadnezzar of the Bible: and he is sup* ported by the same author in stating, that Bucht-ul-nassar took Jerusalem, and was the oppressor of the sons of Israel. The tyranny of his son, the Belshazzar of the Scripture, this writer adds, brought upon him the vengeance of Ardisheer Dirazdust, the Artaxerxes liongimanus of the Greeks, who appointed in his room Coreish, a prince of the blood, grandson of Lohrasp, whose mother was descended of a Jewish tribe: and this connexion with the race of Israel is given as a reason, by the Mahomedan historian, for the extraordinary favour which Goreish showed to the Jews, whom he not only released from captivity, but aided in rebuilding the sacred Temple at Jerusalem. The dates (such as they are) of Persian his tory are made very nearly to accord with that epoch, which is fixed as the actual one, when the order was granted for rebuilding the Temple. In support of this hypothesis, it is stated, that the Bible informs us, that Coreish, or Cyrus, only acted a subordinate partTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. under Darius the Mede, at the siege of Babylon: and it is con- ciap . vn. jectured that the name of Darius, which is the Persian word Dara, was given as a title to Ardisheer ill common with other monarchs of Persia. The author concludes, on the ground of the similarity of names and the accordance of dates, that the Coreish of this Maho- medan historian is the real Cyrus of Scripture. I have already stated, that the Persian histories, before the time of Mahomed, have no dates : we can only compute by the number of years they assign to each reign. This computation evidently must become erroneous in the ratio that the period is remote; and about that of which we are writing, we are led, by the great difference that exists in all oriental authors, to put confidence in none. They frequently differ twenty and thirty, and sometimes fifty years in the reign of one king; and when we add to this, that the dates of sacred history are, in some degree, conjectural*, and that the mention of the kings of Persia is always incidental, we must withhold our belief to facts which are supported by such unsatisfactory conclusions. With regard to the name that the Persian chief, liaham Gudurz, is said to have taken of Bucht-ul-nassarf, which is made a ground • ChronologUts are still divided respecting the dates assigned to events in Scrip, tnre. These were first inserted in the margin of the Bible by Lloyd, one of the seven bishops imprisoned by James. They rest npon the authority of Archbishop Usher, and the Chronology of this learned prelate is esteemed the best. It is fonnded upon the Hebrew copy of the Old Testament; and has, on that ground, a pre-eminent title to credit: but it differs as much, especially in the lives of the antediluvians in the Jth chapter of Genesis, from the Samaritan copy, and from the Septuagiut, (the Greek translation made about 288 B. C.) as these do from each other. t 1 he Chevalier D'Ohsson states, that the victories of Raham Gudurz acquired him the name of Nubobelazar; wh ch signifies, he adds, Mercury, Jupiter, and Mars.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. of argument, from its supposed similarity to that of Nebuchadnezzar, it has been before observed, that we have no example in the whole of the history of ancient Persia of a chief of that nation being called by an Arabic* title; and the rank of this leader, who was lieutenant of the sovereign of Persia, appears as irreconcilable to the mighty monarch of Assyria, as that of Coreish, whom the Mahomedan his torian makes the successor of Belshazzar, is to that of the great Cyrus. The account of Bucht-ul-nassar and of Coreish in the Tarikh Tubreef, is copied by some other writers. But Ferdosi takes no notice of any such names: and as we are certain that he exclu sively followed Pehlivi authors, his silence may be received as a presumptive proof that these names are not to be met with in ancient Persian histories. It has been before conjectured, that the learned author of the Tubree, in his general history of the world, may have made an attempt to reconcile the mutilated annals of Persia with what he found in Jewish history: but it has, I trust, been shown, that in the endeavour to establish such an agreement by uncertain etymologies and a vague guess at dates, admitted facts may be brought into doubt, and the cause of truth may receive injury from those who meant to give it their support}. * The latter part of this name only, Ul-Nassar, or the Victorious, is Arabic: Bucht is Persian: and this renders the compound more improbable. f The Coreish of the Tarikh Tubree is never advanced to the throne. + The historical facts recorded in Scripture, relative to the ancient kings of Assyria and Persia, are not numerous, and may be termed incidental. The prophecies regarding these monarchs, and the nations they governed, are more frequent. From the two combined, commentators have written volumes, to explain this part of the ancient history of the world. But the dates of sacred history are still a subject upon whichTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 233 The events of the reign of Lohrasp, the successor of Kai Khoos- chap. vii. roo, are differently related by almost every Mahomedan historian. These are neither agreed as to his lineage, his disposition, or Lohrasp 6 his history; and it is remarkable, that the page of Ferdosi has fewer events in this and the succeeding reigns that can be deemed historical, than in the preceding. This is, perhaps, to be referred in a very considerable degree to that national vanity which preserves alone the records of its prosperity and glory, and either blots out altogether, or covers with fable, the traditions of its misfortunes or disgrace: but we must observe, that in proportion as these circum stances lessen the title of Persian historians to our credit, that of Greek writers is increased. We now, indeed, approach the period at which Herodotus lived, and his page becomes consequently more worthy of our attention. Ferdosi informs us, that the elevation of Lohrasp was not entirely approved by the Persian nobles ; but that his the learned are far from agreed : and it would be impossible, even if these were fixed beyond dispute, to ground any conclusion upon their coincidence with Grecian or Persian histories, till we had determined that the latter had equal claim to our credit. There cannot, therefore, be an attempt more arduous than that of the chronologist who endeavours to elucidate the dates and events of this early period of oriental history. The chronology of Scripture is unsatisfactory, from the scantiness of facts, the confu- sion of dates, the errors arising from the writing of proper names in different lan guages, and the variety of appellations often used to designate the same person. The profane history of this era, which professes to be more particular, and which affords us long catalogues of kings, and a series of their actions, though delightful when we peruse it for amusement, is found, on minute examination, to be so involved in fable, and so perplexed by contradictory accounts, that we can hardly permit our minds to be convinced of more than the certainty of a few important facts, which prove the exist ence of particular kings, and the occurrence of some great revolutions in the monarchies of Assyria and Persia. vol. i. 2 If234 TKB HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vii. good qualities overcame their reluctance to acknowledge him: and t ] ia t } after a reign of one hundred years, he resigned his throne to his Gushtasp. son, Gushtasp, and retired to Bulkh, where he was slain in a general massacre of the followers of Zoroaster, whose opinions he had adopted. There is every ground to believe, that the reign of Lohrasp His reig» is includes both that of Cambyses and of Smerdis Magi. The dates LTdftte cannot easily be reconciled; but the events, which are of more con- iStHSfc sequence, may. The successful expedition of his army to the West, Magl ' appears to be the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses : and the manner and period at which he lost his life, obviously relate to the massacre of the magi. Supposed to The Persian historians term Gushtasp the son of Lohrasp: but, if Hysu'spel he is the Darius Hystaspes of the Greeks, as is generally conjectured, his descent, as given by Herodotus, would better accord with that which the Persians assign to Lohrasp. But we can do no more than offer a conjecture, founded upon what precedes and follows the life of this prince, that his reign, which oriental writers inform us com prised sixty years, includes both that of Darius Hystaspes, and of his son, the celebrated Xerxes: and we may conclude, (if we adopt this hypothesis,) that the invader of Greece was the renowned son of Mondear Gushtasp, Isfundear, who always commanded his father's armies; and btfXerxes. 0 who, among other enterprises, is said, by Ferdosi, to have conducted a great expedition into Asia-Minor*. From Persian authors we have nothing but fable upon this subject; and Greek writers have, by their vain and unparalleled exaggeration-f- of the num- # This country is generally known to Persians by the term Room, or Muluk-e- Mughrub ; i. e. the region of the West. f According to Herodotus, the followers of Xerxes amounted to five millions two hundred and eighty-three thousand two hundred and twenty. Isocrates, in hisTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 23c hers of their enemies, thrown a veil of doubt over this memorable chap. vii. event, which warrants us in disbelieving all they have narrated, except that their country was invaded by a powerful army under a Persian prince, and that this army was defeated. The Greeks assign a reign of thirty-six years to Darius Hystaspes, and of twenty-one to Xerxes, which agrees within three years of the period that Persian authors give to Gushtasp: but this casual agree ment of dates cannot be admitted as evidence, farther than in support of proofs of a more conclusive character. According to the Greeks, Artaxerxes Longimanus, son of Xerxes, upon his fathers death, ascended the throne of Persia. Eastern authors state, that, on the death of Gushtasp, he was not succeeded by his son, Isfundear, but by his grandson, Bahman, who was known by the name of Ardishecr Dirazdust*, or Ardisheer with the long hands; and there can be no doubt whatever, from the similarity of uTrteLe, name, and the epithet which described a personal deformity, that L ° n 8 im »' us - Paimthenaicos, estimates the land army, in ronnd numbers, at five millions. And with them, Plutarch in general agrees. But sueh myriads appeared to Diodorus, Pliny, -Elian, and other writers, so mneh heyond all belief, that they at once cut off about four-fifths, to bring the calculation within the line of probability. • Khondemir relates, that the name of this prince was Ardisheer; that the epithet, Dirazdust, was applied to him, because he had long arms; and that the name of Bahman was given to him on account of his good disposition, which was the signifi. cation of that word in the Syrian language. Bahman, in Shanserit, (as has been already stated,) signifies « possessing arms;» and the stanza from Ferdosi has been quoted, in which he observes, that this monarch's fingers, when he stood upright, came below'his ■knees. All these proofs render it certain that Ardisheer and Artaxerxes are the same ■ and this point being admitted as beyond all doubt, is of great importance in determining the epoch both of Cyrus and of Xerxes.23 g THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vii. Artaxerxes and Ardisheef were oiie and the same person. It is also recorded by the Greek historians, that Xerxes was slairl by his relation, Artabanus, who is described as a powerful and ambitious chief, that had placed Artaxerxes upon the throne, with an inten tion of seizing it for himself. He had, the same authors assert, many dependants, and his sons were the most celebrated among the warriors of Persia for their personal prowess and their courage, puts Artaba- Artaxerxes, having become aware of his designs, put Artabanus to nUS t0 death. This act produced a war, in which several of the heroes of Persia were slain. But the prince succeeded in his object —the extinction of the name and power of the family of Artabanus; and took vengeance for the blood of his father, by putting to death every one that had been concerned in his murder. If we compare the account which Persian writers give of this transaction, and divest it of what is evidently fiction, we shall find a complete correspondence in every essential which can be necessary to establish, that the Persian and Greek authors record in this part of ancient history the same The similarity event. Roostum, the hero of Persia, was hereditary Prince of Seistan, ^^tabanTs and nearly related to the royal family. He was powerful, (eastern iioostum authors inform us,) not only from his character and possessions, but from the number and quality of his relations and dependants: and his sons were the most renowned among the warriors of Persia for their valour and prowess. This chief slew Isfundear: but he protected Ardisheer, the son of that prince, who, through his influence, ascended the throne. Ardisheer, however, soon became jealous of Iioostum, and not only caused that chief to be slain, but invaded and subdued his hereditary province, and put to death all his family, on the cowardly pretext of revenging the blood of his father. TheTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 237 above is the substance of what Persian authors record upon this chap . vir. subject: and its exact agreement with Grecian writers*, combined with the positive identity of the Persian king, Ardisheer Dirazdust, with Artaxerxes Longimanus, proves, almost beyond a doubt, that the celebrated Xerxes of the Greeks is the Isfundearf of oriental authors. * The Greeks always speak of Xerxes as the sovereign of Persia. But Persian authors say that Isfundear never had the name of king, though, for a time, when viceroy at Bulkh, he possessed regal power. This is no material difference: and we may suspect, that the national vanity which swelled a Persian army, at such a distance from the seat of government, into five millions of men, would not hesitate to anticipate what appeared his certain destiny, by placing a crown upon the head of the royal leader of such a mighty force. Besides, it is far from improbable that Isfundear might have been associated in sovereignty by a father, who is stated to have always employed him in the command of his armies, and the government of a part of his empife. t The history which Ferdosi gives of this prince is very fabulous: and his hero, Roos- tum, is brought from that repose, which a century before Kai Khoosroo had deemed him entitled to enjoy, on account of his great age, which was then four hundred, to fight one whom he loves and venerates, because the cruel and jealous Gushtasp, envious of Isfundear's glory, had persuaded that prince to undertake the dangerous enterprise of bringing Roostum bound to his presence. The hero, who cannot submit to this extreme disgrace, engages Isfundear, and kills him, but bewails the cruel necessity that had compelled him to such an act; and takes charge of the deceased prince's son, the young Bahman, or Ardisheer Dirazdust, who afterwards mounts the throne. Roostum is murdered : and the king makes war upon his family, on the ground of revenging the death of his father. It is obvious that the poet, not able to dispense with the hero of his poem, has no mode of reconciling his exploits of Roostum with the history of the country, but by giving him an antediluvian age, and ascribing to him all that tradition had recorded of a race of heroes that lived during the periods of which he writes. But it is to be remarked, that Ferdosi, with all his exaggerations.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. We are told in the eastern histories of Ardisheer, that he was a good and great prince; and he is said not only to have conquered Seistan, the hereditary province of the family of Roostum, but to have been eminently successful in some expeditions to the westward. We are also informed, that he treated the Jewish nation with great favour: and all authors concur in their accounts of the improvements that he made in the internal government of his kingdom. This history of Ardisheer generally accords with that of Artaxerxes * never altogether omits the historical facts he possessed : and we clearly trace, in his tale of Roostum and Isfundear, that a prince of Persia was slain by a powerful chief of that country; that the chief aided the son of the prince whom he had put to death to ascend the throne; and that, after some period, he was murdered, and his family destroyed by the monarch he had supported : and these facts appear, when connected with the identity of Ardisheer and Artaxerxes, quite sufficient to prove, that, amid all the extravagant fables with which this part of his poem is decorated, the author has still preserved the principal historical facts, and that his Isfundear can be no other but Xerxes. * Artaxerxes is mentioned in Scripture under the name of Ahasuerus, which was probably a title like ^hoosroo, as it is given to several Persian kings. He is believed to be the monarch who married Esther; and he became, in consequence of his love to her, and the services rendered to him by her uncle, Mordecai, the powerful friend and protector of the Jews. This account is supported by several Mahomedan authors, who affirm the fact of the kindness of this king to the Jews, and state, as ftie reason, that one of his favourite ladies was of that race. It may also be received in support of this fact, that the tomb of Esther and Mordecai stands in the centre of Ha- madan, the ancient Ecbatana. The sepulchre is not splendid : but we must recollect it was not likely that either Ahasuerus or his successors would build a mausoleum, as such mode of interment was contrary to the religion they professed: but their per mitting the Jews to build a tomb in the most public place of Ecbatana, implies an extraordinary -respect for those, to perpetuate whose memory such an edifice was erected.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. OQr -«3i; Longimanus, as given by the Greeks; who relate his punishment chap . vn. of the family of Artabanus, whose possessions he seized; his expe- dition to Bactria against his brother; and his great reforms in the internal government of his dominions. Persian historians mention that this prince sat upon the throne one hundred and twelve years : but the Greeks, who, at this period, merit superior credit, limit his reign to forty-one. It is here worthy of observation, that no other prince of the name of Ardisheer, or Artaxerxes, is ever noticed by oriental writers: and it would seem not impossible that the similarity of name between this prince and his grandson, Artaxerxes Mnemon, as well as the successor of that Artaxerxes prince, the Ochus of the Greeks, who was also called Artaxerxes, ^Ochu'.' may have led to their history being blended* with that of Ardisheer Dirazdust. Persian authors take no notice of Xerxes the Second and Xerxes the Se- Sogdianus, whose united reigns only amounted to eight months: and considering the character of their traditions, we could not expect any mention of such ephemeral rulers. But the nature of those intrigues, which raised, and cast down, these monarchs, may dispose us to grant some credit to their account of Homaif, Homai. who, they inform us, was Queen of Persia for thirty-two years, and then resigned her crown to her son, Darab the First. This princess was, according to oriental writers, the daughter of Ardisheer. * The aggregate reigns of the three princes of this family, whose history is given by Greek writers under the name of Artaxerxes, amounts, within a few years, to the period which Persian authors assign to that of Ardisheer Dirazdust, or Artaxerxes Longimanus. t The meaning of this name is, a bird of Paradise.240 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vii. They relate, that when that monarch died, she was pregnant by him ; but that, ashamed of the incestuous intercourse, she not only con cealed the birth of the infant, but ordered it to be put to death. It Darab the was, however, miraculously preserved : and, under a strange name, became distinguished as a military leader. When the mother disco vered the son whom she had abandoned, she resigned her crown to him; and the young prince, on his ascending the throne, assumed the name of Darab: his former appellation is not mentioned. Whoever peruses the accounts which the Greek authors give of the morals of the Persian kings at this period, will meet with facts to satisfy him, that the incestuous intercourse, of which eastern writers accuse Ardisheer and his daughter, may be fairly received in support of the truth of this tradition; and amid the confusion that followed the death of that monarch, his daughter might have been elevated to the throne. We have evidence in the subse quent history of Persia, when the same religion and manners pre vailed, that there was nothing very repugnant to national prejudice in such a measure*; and we learn from other sources, that the queens Homaiiscom- of this period enjoyed a great degree of power. The Parysatisf parysatis 0/ of the Greeks, who was the daughter of Artaxerxes, and the wife of the Greeks. ^ brother, Darius Nothus, is represented as possessing an influence and authority in the government, that would seem to approxi mate her to the Homai of Persian authors. The principal argument against such a conclusion, is the coincidence we find * The two daughters of Khoosroo Purveez were successively raised to the throne. —Vide page 163, 164. f This word is from the Persian Peri Zada, or ' of fairy race;' and is a common female appellation in Persia-THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. between the Persian account of the first Darab of their history, chap, vil and the Grecian Darius Nothus*, or Darius the Bastard ; nor is it easy to refuse some degree of credit to what Ferdosi and other ^ the history eastern writers relate, regarding the actual reign of Homai, when we RmandDa! consider, that though they have omitted the names of several kings in nuS Nothus ' their catalogue of the former rulers of their country, they cannot be charged with having interpolated one. But it has been before remarked, that this is the most obscure epoch of their history. We have, indeed, in their tales of this period, hardly an event-j- from which we can draw a comparison with those facts that have been preserved by other nations. If the conjecture of the first Darab J of oriental authors and the Darius Nothus of the Greeks being the same person be unfounded, * Both the Persians and Grecians state that sovereign to have been of illegitimate birth: and both inform us that he changed his name to Darius upon ascending the throne. t The very imperfect traditions which the Persians have preserved of this part of their history, puts it out of our power to compare their accounts with either Ctesias or Xenophon. We have, in fact, no distinct mention of the monarch at whose court the former resided. The name of the younger Cyrus is not noticed by oriental writers: and they never make the slightest allusion to that celebrated expedition which has given immortality to its commander. J The account that some Persian authors give of the intercourse and alliance between Darab the First and Philip of Macedon, is an obvious fable, meant to palliate the disgrace of a conquered people, by establishing the right of Alexander as heir to the throne of Persia : and this fable, therefore, which makes the first Darab of the Persians and Philip cotemporaries, cannot be admitted to affect the conjecture which supposes that monarch to be Darius Nothus. It is further to be observed, that the story of Alexander's birth is decidedly disavowed by some of the most respectable Persian his torians; and even the poet, Nizamee, in his fine poem on Alexander, rejects this vol. i. 2 i242 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . we must reject the reign of Homai altogether, on the supposition that it refers to some confused traditions of the power and grandeur of the queen, Parysatis, mixed, perhaps, with the tale of the incestuous intercourse between Artaxerxes Mnemon and his daughter, Attossa; and, under this view, if we suppose the reign of Darius Nothus and Artaxerxes Mnemon to be included, by Persian authors, in that of Ardisheer, the dates will nearly correspond*, and the Ochus of the Greeks will be the first Darab of the Persians. With respect to the Darab the Se- second Darab, there can be no question: his identity with the Darius cond, or Da rius Codoma- Codomanus of the Greeks is completely established by the conquest of Persia by Alexander. The reign of The traditions which eastern writers have preserved of the Mace- Alexander the , . , . r , Great. doman hero, are very imperfect; and upon a few historical facts they have reared a superstructure of the most extravagant fable. It is unnecessary to examine the connexion between their history of Alexander and that of the Greeks: they agree in most of the leading facts: such as the invasion of Persia, the defeat and subse quent death of Darius, the generosity of the conqueror, and the strong impression which his noble and humane conduct made upon his dying enemy. The Persians do not concur with the Greeks in their description of Darius: they allege, that he was deformed in body and pedigree as a fable. It is, however, to be remarked, that some western as well as eastern romances state, that Alexander was not the son of Philip; and the adultery of Olympias is adduced as the ground upon which she was repudiated by that monarch, though the divorce did not take place till some time after the birth of Alexander. * Ardisheer reigned, according to Persian authors, one hundred and twelve years. The united reigns of that prince, of Darius Nothus, and Artaxerxes Mnemon, amount to one hundred and six years.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 243 wicked m mind : but he is obviously thus described, to reconcile the chap, vil vanity of a nation to the tale of its subjugation. We have, in their page, an allusion to the friendship which Alexander established with Taxihs, or Omphis, and an account of his battle with Porus, and his expedition against the Scythians: but in none of these accounts do we find more than the mere event upon which we can place any reliance: the rest, not excepting the circumstances recorded of his death, are all fable. His great name has been considered sufficient to obtain credit for every story that imagination could invent: but this exaggeration is almost all praise. The Secunder of the Persian page is a model of every virtue and of every great quality that can elevate a human being above his species; while his power and mag nificence are always represented as far beyond what has ever been attained by any other monarch in the world. The confusion into which Persia was thrown at the death of Alexander, has caused a great blank in the records of that nation; whose historians, as has been before stated, take no notice whatever of his immediate successors. A period of nearly five centuries, during which the two branches of the Arsacides^- governed that The reign of country, is reduced to less than three by Persian writers; whose theArsacides - imperfect and contradictory statements warrant us in pronoun cing, that all they possess regarding this epoch is an incorrect Persians have catalogue of names. Ferdosi, indeed, passes it over as one of' 0 T h T? c 1 records of this which no trace of history had been preserved. He states, that period ' * We learn from western authors, that there were twenty monarchs of the first branch of the Arsacidje, who ruled over Parthia two hundred and seventy years: and of the second, there were eleven kings, whose collective reigns occupied a space of two hundred and twenty-one years.244 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vn. at the death of Alexander the Great the empire of Persia fell j n t 0 a state of confusion, in which it remained for two centuries; governed by petty rulers*, and distracted by internal wars: and adds, that so unstable was the authority of these contending chiefs, that Persia may be considered, during the whole of this time, as a nation without a sovereign. After this short and general observation, he proceeds to the life of Ardisheer, the founder of the Sassanian race of kings. The total omission of the history of this period by Ferdosi, is calculated to increase our reliance upon that author; for it proves that, however he may have indulged his imagination in the embellish ment of his subject, he was scrupulous in taking its substance from the Pehlivi manuscripts from which he composed his poem: and we may assume, from his silence, that in these no mention was to be found of the Parthian dynasties. The reason of this blank in the history of Persia appears obvious. In that nation, as in others of similar condition, the terms learned and religious were synonimous. The priest alone cultivated letters; and the great neglect into which the rites of Zoroaster fell f, during the reign of the Arsacides, may be * The Moolook-u-Tuaif. f Sylvester de Sacey, in his very learned work upon the antiquities of Persia, affords ns abundant proof of the religion of Zoroaster having been neglected during the rule of the Parthian kings. He informs us, on the authority of Greek writers, that though the magi existed as a body long before the time of Artaxerxes, they were held in no respect, and even treated with contempt by the civil magistrates; and we must conclude, that a religion could hardly have been observed by those who despised its ministers. But we derive still more convincing evidence of the change that occurred, from the coins that have been preserved of the Parthian kings, and of the monarchs of the Sassanian dynasty. The former have no figures upon them that are.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ deemed the principal cause why the same authors who have blazoned chap. vii. the fame of Artaxerxes* and his successors, should, as far as they had the power, have consigned the race of monarchs, by whom they were immediately preceded, to oblivion. Though western writers have not denied that descent from the Royal descent ancient kings of Persia which oriental authors claim for Ashk or Arsatef' 0r Arsaces, they have almost all agreed in describing the Parthiansf as being originally Scythians, or Tartars, who, according to their statements, ruled over Persia for several centuries. There are, however, several reasons which suggest a doubt of this fact; and one of the best informed of ancient writers J expressly states, that ' the Parthians, whose territories were upon the banks of the Parthianssup- ' Tigris, were formerly called Carduchi.' The geographical origtiiyCat position of Carduchia, the modem Kurdistan, the character of ducbi ' its barbarous and unsubdued inhabitants, and their constant hostility \\ to the kings of Persia, renders it very probable, that, invited by the confusion into which that country was thrown by the divisions among the successors of Alexander, the Carduchi descended from their mountains, to share in the spoil of a broken in any shape, allusive to the religion of Zoroaster: and the inscriptions upon them are in the Greek language: while the latter are ornamented with a marked symbol of the worship of fire, « an altar and sacred flame:' and all the inscriptions are in the ancient language of Persia.— Jntiquites de la Perse, page 43 45. * Ardisheer. f Fergusson asserts this, in his Roman history, on the authority of Justin and Dio Cass.

But it would be as useless to know, as it is difficult to ascertain, whether the original Parthians or, in other words, the Reign of the 0 Parthians, first tribes to whom that name was given, came from the banks of the Oxus, or those of the Tigris: for it is obvious, that when that appellation became general to the kingdom of Persia, it must have included a hundred races, besides those to whom authors have laboured to trace it. All we can safely conclude is, that the period at which the greater part of the kingdom of Persia was known to the European world as Parthia, was one during which that country was distracted by the continual contests of its own princes, and independant chiefs. That a sense of common danger enabled several of the Parthian monarchs to meet their foreign enemies with great armies, there can be no doubt: and we also know, that the monarchs whom this circumstance, or their superior character, had elevated to supreme rule, assumed the proudest state, and the highest titles. But these facts are not sufficient to prove that the Arsa- cides ever attained a rank equal to those races of kings by whom they were preceded, and followed. The Parthian rulers can perhaps only be deemed the heads of a great confederacy of feudal chiefs, each of whom aspired to regal powerf: and, though * The term Parthia is unknown to Asiatic writers. We are informed by western authors, that it means, in the ancient Scythian, exiles; and, as such, it is given as a proof of their descent. I have been quite unable to trace this etymology, and conceive that it would prove nothing, if traced. f It has been before observed, that Pliny states that the kingdom of Parthia was divided into eighteen kingdoms.

From the commencement of the Sassanian dynasty the history of Persia assumes a new character: and there is as fair an agreement J) ™ sly - etween eastern and western writers as can be expected from authors of different nat.ons. Persian writers have no dates, even at this epoch ; but the period they assign to the reign of each prince generally accords with the more exact chronology of western authors: and we are led, by these circumstances, to grant our belief to the general truth of their history of the Sassanian monarchs, who occu- ped the throne of Persia till that kingdom fell under the dominion or the Caliphs of Arabia.

This, however, see ms of less importance, when we consider that the Persian chronology of this period has no foundation, but a vague tradition of the duration of each monarch's reign. To several of their princes they assign more than a century: and, even in these uncertain and extravagant periods, hardly two authors agree. It would be a waste of time to reason upon any accordance in such dates: I have, there fore, in comparing the accounts of oriental writers with those of the Greeks, neither deemed the casual agreement nor disagreement of dates to be a circumstance that could ever be brought to support or invalidate conclusions, deduced from the more certain and satis factory source of coinciding facts. From the death of Alexander till the reign of Ardisheer Babigan, the second Artaxerxes of the Greeks, it is still more impossible to reconcile the Persian dates with those of either Grecian or Roman historians : which arises from the simple fact of Asiatic writers having do account of this period, that merits the name of history. They give us, as has been staled, a mere catalogue of kings, and their calculation of the years that the monarchs they mention reigned, is less, by some centuries, than the actual time which this epoch includes: for we cannot be mistaken in our estimate of the duration of the reigns of the Parthian rulers, who flourished during the most remarkable period of Roman history. The computed dates of Persian authors, from the reign of Ardi sheer Babigan till the overthrow of Yezdijird, as well as the principal facts they record, correspond sufficiently with western writers to entitle us to term this an historical epoch. The accounts we have of the monarchs of the Sassanian dynasty are blended with some fables, and frequently embellished with hyperbolical descriptions: but noTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 251 eastern work is altogether free from these faults; and when we reflect chap . vn. upon the blank there appears to have been in the Persian annals till the rise of this family, and the complete ruin in which that kingdom was involved by the Mahomedan conquest, there will appear more cause to congratulate ourselves upon the correctness of the general outline of what has been preserved, than for regret at those inaccu racies and omissions which we must expect to meet with, even in this portion of the ancient history of Persia. A mong the traces of a great nation's former glory, there is none upon which the mind dwells with more serious thought, than on the magnificent ruins of its ancient palaces. How forcibly are we reminded of our condition when told, that an edifice, in the erection of which a kingdom's wealth had been exhausted, which was adorned with every ornament that the art of the world could supply, and whose history was engraven on the imperishable rocks with which it was con structed, was not only fallen into decay, but that its founder was unknown, and the language, in which its history was inscribed, was no longer numbered among the tongues of men! Persia abounds with such remains of forgotten splendour: for, to use the elegant and emphatic words of a poet of that nation, « the spider weaves « the web in the palace of Caesar! The owl stands sentinel upon ' the watch-tower of Afrasiab*!' The ruins of the palace of Persepolis are by far the grandest Ruins of Per- that yet remain : and, from what is left of this proud edifice, we may sepolis ' pronounce, that it once rivalled the noblest fabrics of Greece or of * ' Purdadaree-me-kunnud dir Kuser-e-Kyser ank-e-boot!

These have occupied the time and the talents of eminent travellers and artists: nor shall I add to the various opinions which have been offered regarding the founder of this great monument of Persian art and magnificence, or offer any conjectures upon the meaning of its rich and varied sculpture. Till the inscriptions on its walls are deciphered, these facts will probably remain unknown. Persian authors* ascribe this palace to Jemsheed: and they name it his * The author of the Zeenut-ul-Mujalis gives the following short account of Perse- polis, which, I can state from personal observation, is not much exaggerated in the descriptive parts: and it is curious, as it shows what Persians believe regarding these famous ruins. « Jemsheed,' this writer states, ' built a fortified palace at the foot of a hill, which « bounds the fine plain of Murdasht to the north-west. The platform on which it was ' built has three faces to the plain, and one to the mountain. It is formed of a hard « black granite 18 . The elevation from the plain is ninety feet: and every stone used « in this building, is from nine to twelve feet long, and broad in proportion. There « are two great flights of stairs to this palace, so easy of ascent, that a man can ride « up on horseback; and on the platform a palace has been erected, part of which « still remains in its original state, and part in ruins. The palace of Jemsheed is that « now called the Chehel-Setoon 1 ', or forty pillars. Each pillar is formed of a carved ' stone, is sixty feet i0 high, and is ornamented in a manner so delicate, that it would ' seem difficult to rival this sculpture upon hard granite 11 in a carving upon the « softest wood. There is no granite like that' of which these pillars are made, to 18 It is a hard lime-stone. 19 All Persian authors state that antimony is found in these ruins. ao In these measures, the author has used the word guz, which I have translated guz-shah, or royal yard, « three feet:' there are other guz, shorter. 41 The author of the Fars Namah is quoted, who says it is almost impossible to break this granite: and that, if broke and ground, it is excellent to stop the bleeding of wounds. ' The pillars here mentioned are evidently cut out of the rock at the foot of which it stands, as more pillars, half-finished, lying on the mountain, attest.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ Tukht, or throne. They add, that Homai, the daughter of Ardi- chap . vn. sheer, greatly improved this royal mansion, which she made her constant residence; and that it was destroyed by Alex ander*. The City of Istakhr, near which it stood, long survived the destruction of the throne of Jemsheed: and we learn, from historians on whom we can depend, that its inhabitants were distinguished by their inveterate hatred of the conquerors of their country; and, as if inspired by those fragments of former glory with which they were surrounded, they maintained a character for pride and courage, that was not entirely subdued till several centuries after the Arabians first overran Persia-}-. Not only the palace of Persepolis, but the face of the mountain at the foot of which it is situated, and many of the rocks in its vicinity, are ornamented with sculpture, in which we may trace a connexion with the page of Ferdosi; and there is ample evidence to prove, that the Persians were in the habit of describing, by sculpture, both their religious ceremonies, and the principal events of their ' be now found in Persia: and it is unknown from whence it was brought. Some ' most beautiful and extraordinary figures ornament this palace; and all the pillars ' which once supported the roof, (for that has fallen,) are composed of three pieces of ' stone, joined in so exquisite a manner, as to make the beholder believe that the « whole shaft is one piece. There are several figures of Jemsheed in the sculpture: « in one, he has an urn in his hand, in which he burns benjamin, while he stands « adoring the sun. In another, he is represented as seizing the mane of a lion with ' one hand, while he stabs him with the other.' * Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. t The final ruin of Persepolis is attributed to Sumeanah-u-Dowlah, the unworthy son of the virtuous Azd-u-Dowlah.

Several of the figures at Persepolis are represented as adoring fire; and in the vicinity of Shahpoor, (a city about eighty miles to the west of Shiraz, which was the capital of Shahpoor, or Sapor, the First,) we find, carved upon the rock, a representation of that monarch holding the Roman emperor. Valerian, prisoner, while he receives some ambassadors, who supplicate the release of the royal captive. Opposite to this monument of triumph are some more pieces of historical sculpture ; in which there is one compart ment that represents a king, seated in state, amid a group of figures standing before him, one of whom offers two heads to the monarch s notice. If we wanted other evidence, this alone would mark the state of civilisation to which a nation had advanced, that could suffer its glory to be perpetuated by a representation of so barbarous a character. To Shahpoor the Persian historians also ascribe the foundation of the modern City of Shuster, which is situated on the Karoon, at a distance of nearly thirty miles to the east of the ancient capital of Shus, or Susa*. Shus, these authors inform us, is a Pehlivi word, signifying pleasant; and Shuster is the comparative degree of that word, and means more pleasant. The same tradition adds, that Shahpoor compelled his Roman captives to aid in building this city: and travellers are shown the tower where the Persians believe the unfortunate Valerian was confined: but what renders this city most remarkable among the ancient monuments of Persian grandeur, is the dyke in its vicinity, which its founder threw across the Karoon, to turn the course of that river into a channel more * Kinnier's ' Geographical Memoirs of Persia.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. _ 255 favourable to agriculture. This dyke is formed of cut stones, chap . vn. cemented by lime, and fastened together by clamps of iron: it is twenty feet broad, and no less than twelve hundred in length. The whole is a solid mass, excepting in the centre, where two small ^ V Cimty ' arches have been constructed, for the purpose of allowing a part of the stream to flow in its natural bed. This great work is more worthy of our attention, from being almost the only one of a useful nature that we can trace amid those vast ruins, which speak the pomp and magnificence of the former monarchs of Persia: and it has, as if preserved by its superior character, survived all the sumptuous palaces and luxurious edifices of the same age. The trifling damage which it had sustained from time and the rapid stream of the Karoon, was repaired a few years ago; and it again fulfils its original purpose, of fertilizing the beautiful plains of Desful. The City of Shuster, though much reduced in size, is still the capital of a province : it lies at the foot of a range of mountains, and overhangs the rapid stream of the Karoon. A bridge, of one arch, which has an elevation of more than eighty feet, connects it with the country on the opposite bank*. Thirty-six miles to the west of Shuster we begin to trace the ruins of the ancient Shusf, or Susa. Ruins of Shus, These are situated between the modern town of Desful, and the orSuS3 ' eastern banks of the Karasoo River; along which they stretch up wards of twelve miles. They consist, like those of Babylon, of large * Kinnier's ' Geography of Persia.' t It is sometimes written Sus : the modern pronunciation is Shus,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. mounds* formed of bricks and coloured tilesf. At the foot of one of these mounds stands the tomb of the prophet Daniel}!: it is a small building, but sufficient to shelter some derveishes, who watch the remains of the prophet, and are supported by the alms of pious pilgrims, who visit the holy sepulchre.

At a distance of six miles from the modern City of Kermanshah, Sculptures of the excavations from the rock, which are termed Tauk-e-bostan* present us with some figures cut in so masterly a style, that we are almost inclined to believe the Persian monarch, under whose auspices this work was executed, might have obtained the aid of Grecian or Roman artists. The mountains in which these excavations are made, form the northern boundary of the plain of Kermanshah. The most considerable is an arch cut in the rock, fifty or sixty feet in height, twenty in depth, and twenty-four in breadth : over the centre of the arch is an emblematical figure, resembling a crescent; and on each side an angelf, with a wreath, or a diadem, in one hand, and a cup in the other. At the extremity of this arched excavation is the gigantic figure of a man on horseback, clothed in full armour. There are three figures J over this, and the sides of the cave are covered * The literal translation of this name is, ' the arch of the garden.' f The figure on the right is tolerably perfect; but the hand and arm of the left figure are the only vestiges of it now visible, in consequence of a large fragment of the rock on which it was cut having fallen down. The angel on the right is well proportioned, and dressed in loose flowing robes. It would appear, from the shape of the rock, that there must have been some other sculpture and inscriptions imme diately above these, which time, and the inclemency of the weather, have defaced and destroyed. t These three large figures are in an upright posture : they, however, are so much defaced, that nothing but the general outline can be defined. On the right, a female holds a diadem, or circle, in her right hand, with which she is offering to crown the principal male figure in the centre; in her left she holds a goblet, in such a manner as if she were pouring a libation. Over the head of the centre figure, which is vol. i. 2 l258 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vii. with very fine sculpture, representing, in one compartment, the hunting of the wild boar along the banks of a river by men in boats and on elephants: and on the opposite side, the same figures, on horseback and on elephants, are represented as pursuing deer. There are a variety of other sculptures at the Tauk-e-Bostan; and the labour and knowledge of a French scholar has, by explaining a Pehlivi inscription*, enabled us to identify two figures that are cut larger than the others, is a crescent. The right hand of this figure appears to be grasping a ring, with the male figure on his left; in his left hand is a straight sword, resting on the ground, between his feet. The figure on the left is dressed in a long mantle; but what he holds in his left hand cannot be ascertained: the face of this image is still perfect; he has a long beard, and wears a helmet on his head, with a ball on the top of it. # Silvester de Sacey, a member of the Institute at Paris, had made the following translation of this inscription, which is divided into two parts. The First.—' This figure is that of a worshipper of Hormuzd, or God, the ex- « cellent Shahpoor, king of kings, of Iran and An-Iran, a celestial germ of a heavenly « race, the son of the adorer of God, the excellent Hormuzd; a king of kings, of Iran ' and An-Iran, a celestial germ of a heavenly race, grandson of the excellent Narses, ' king of kings.' The Second.—' This figure is that of a worshipper of Hormuzd, or God, the ex- ' cellent Varahram, king of kings, king of Iran and An-Iran, a celestial germ of a ' heavenly race, son of the adorer of God, the excellent Shahpoor; king of kings, of ' Iran and An-Iran, a celestial germ of a heavenly race, grandson of the excellent ' Hormuzd, king of kings.' I gave this inscription to Moullah Firoze, a learned priest of the Parsees at Bombay, and he assured me that the translation of de Sacey was correct. Firoze ex plained the w r ord An-Iran to mean unbelievers: Eer, he informed me, was a Pehlivi word, which signified believer; Eeran was its plural: in Pehlivi the a or an pre fixed, is a privative, as in Greek and Shanscrit; and, consequently, An-Eeran meant unbelievers. The King of Eeran and An-Eeran he interpreted to mean King ofIllTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 259 ©ut of the face of the rock, as Shahpoor Zoolactaf, and his son, chap . vn. Baharam. We discover, in another part of this sculpture, a repre- sentation of two sovereigns holding a ring, or circle, in their right hands, and standing upon a prostrate Roman soldier. A figure, supposed to be the prophet Zoroaster, stands by their side: his feet rest upon a star, and his head is covered with a glory *, or crown of rays. There is no doubt that this sculpture was executed in the reign of Baharam, the founder of the City of Kermanshah; and that the figures represent that monarch, and his father, Shahpoor. The ring which they grasp is probably meant as a type of the world; and the prostrate Roman soldier appears to be an emblem of the fallen state of that empire. The ruins of Babylon have been often described : they consist of Ruins of Ba bylon. large and misshapen mounds-f-; amid which, none of that regularity which distinguished the vast palaces of this once proud city can now be traced.

This, however, is, like all conjectures founded on etymology, very uncertain. * I am informed by the Parsees, or Guebers, that in almost all the paintings or sculptures that represent Zoroaster, he is always distinguished by a crown of rays, or glory, as in that I have described. f If the arrow-headed character be ever deciphered, we may hope to discover many of the particulars of the history of Babylon as well as of Persepolis, for great numbers of bricks of various shapes are found at Babylon, covered with inscriptions in this character. That learned orientalist. Doctor Wilkins, has discovered, that the inscriptions which have been brought to Europe are of twoxlifferent characters; and his observations lead to the conclusion, that this language was written from the left to the right.260 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vn. Along the banks of this celebrated river we now see the place of former magnificence occupied by the scattered tents of Arabian robbers, whose only desire is to increase that waste with which they delight to be surrounded, Oormia, In the north-western parts of Persia there are few traces to be found of the ancient splendour of that country. Oormia, a town in Aderbijan, celebrated for being the birth-place of Zoroaster, and for Tauris, the its temples, has nothing left of its former grandeur. In Tabreez*, modern Ta- . . m • i treez. the capital of Media, (which, under the Armenian prince, lendates, usurped the name and attempted to rival the glory of Ecbatana,) we can discover hardly any remains of its former greatness : but nature has combined with man against this city, which has oftener been reduced to Ectatana, the ruins by earthquakes than by wars. Even Ecbatana itself, the modem modern Ha- madan. Hamadan-f*, has nothing but the tombs of Mordecai and Esther * The ancient Tauris. t The sepulchre of Mordeeai and Esther stands near the centre of the City of Hamadan. A drawing of the dome over the tombs is given, Vol. II. p. 524. Sir Gore 'Ouseley, late ambassador to the Court of Persia, kindly favoured me with the following translation of a Hebrew inscription which he found on this dome: 'Thursday, fifteenth ' of the month of Adar, in the year 4474 from the creation of the world, was finished ' the building of this temple over the graves of Mordecai and Esther, by the hands of u the good hearted brothers, Elias and Samuel, the sons of the deceased Ismael of ' Kashan.' From this date, (which is in numerical letters, and accords with the Jewish chronology,) the dome must have been built eleven hundred years. The tombs, which are of a black-coloured wood, are evidently of very great antiquity: but the wood has not perished; and the Hebrew inscriptions, with which it is covered, are still very legible. These are the following verses, with the alteration of one expression, from the book of Esther: ' Now in Shushan, the palace, there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, ' the son of Jair, the son of Shemei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite 43 .'

The capital of Mazenderan, Sari, is noticed in the first dawn of Persian history, and continues, with its name unchanged, a place of some consequence. Within the last century, four temples* of the ancient Persians were yet standing in that city, Four ancient which appear to be the only edifices of this description that have ' escaped the hand of time, and the persecuting spirit of the Maho- medan religion, if we except those near Baku in Mazenderan, where piacesofwor- there are still some very ancient places of worship sacred to the ship at Baku ' element of fire.

In the Bible, the last phrase of this verse is, « speaking peace to all his seed.' The more general term, Asia, has probably been added by the vanity of the writer of the inscription : but it is possible that may have been inaccurately translated. The Jews, at Hamadan, have no tradition of the causes of Esther and her uncle being interred at that place. They probably were removed from Susa, after the death of Artaxerxes, (Ahasuerus). The Jewish festival of Purim, which is celebrated on the thirteenth and fourteenth of the month of Adar, in commemoration of the slaughter which the Jews made on those days of their enemies, is still kept up: and at this festival, Jewish pilgrims resort to the tombs of Mordecai and Esther from every quarter, and have done so for centuries. * They are built in the shape of rotundas, about thirty feet in diameter, and one buiidred and twenty in height. —Hanway, Vol. I. page 199. 14 Chap. x. ver. 3.262 THE HISTORY OP PERSIA. chap. vii . blue flame issues, like that which is emitted by burning spirits, but more pure. Though this phenomenon would be produced by opening the soil in several other parts near Baku that are equally impregnated with fire, yet the flame in this temple is deemed sacred and miracu lous by the pious pilgrims who resort to it from the distant banks of the Ganges.

He describes several remarkable ruins, particularly those of the cities of Poolkha and Dooshak, or Seistan. The latter, he states, must once have occupied as great a space as the site of Isfahan. The houses in this city were built of sun-dried bricks, with vaulted roofs, and in general appear to have been two stories high. The modern town of Jullalabad stands amid these ruins: it contains about two thousand inhabitants, whose ruler, Baharam Khan, terms himself Kaianee, and claims descent from the ancient monarchs of Persia.

This short and general view of the antiquities of Persia leads us to consider the character and manners of its former inhabitants: and rLTLt! we are apt to conclude, that there are sufficient traces left to wan-ant l ' U '' s ' a belief that they -were well advanced in all the arts of civilized life, and that they enjoyed, under the rule of some of their ancient kings,' a happiness and prosperity far beyond what they have ever since experienced. This opinion has been so generally adopted, that it would almost appear presumption to doubt its correctness. But truth can never suffer from inquiry or discussion: and there is no part of history of more consequence than that which relates to the govern- ment and manners of the nations described.

The object of ambition among all eastern kings, is to enjoy grandeur, and to leave a great name. Their grandeur is comprised in their personal state and magnificent • The djke across the Karoon at Shuster i s , perhaps, the most remarkable exception.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . palaces; their fame in conquest. These are the passions which animated the breast of a Kai Khoosroo, an Ardisheer, a Nou- sheerwan, a Chengiz, a Timour, and a Nadir Shah: and it is evident that, to effect such objects, (whatever may be his per sonal character,) a monarch must be absolute, and his subjects strangers to freedom. That Persia has been, from the earliest days, under this description of government, there can be no doubt. At some periods, chiefs of provinces, and heads of noble families, have assumed and maintained an independance of the sovereign: and as these are the only objects that we can now trace in this distant scene, we are inclined to believe theirs was the general condition: but it must be obvious, on reflection, that their pretensions and power could only have the effect of multiply ing tyrants, and of vexing the community with internal discord. Grecian ac We are, however, told in Grecian history, that ancient Persia was inhabited by a wise and enlightened race of men, who lived of Persia. un der a just government; and we read in Scripture, that the laws of the Medes and Persians were unchangeable. The accounts which Greek authors have given of the ancient state of Persia, are not in contradiction to what I have stated, as every reader will discover, who attends to the few historical events they have recorded. But the facts they relate should be carefully separated from those fabu lous parts of their writings, in which Greek authors* desire to instruct their own rulers, and inspire their countrymen with a love of virtue, by ascribing every quality that can dignify human nature to the ancient kings and inhabitants of a country, with whose real * There can be no doubt that this observation applies particularly to Xenophon.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ history they were but imperfectly acquainted, and had, therefore, chap. vii. full scope for the indulgence of their imagination. Of the exact form of the ancient government of Persia, we only Andem go- know enough to state that it was an hereditary monarchy; that the ' er ' me ° , ■ power of the sovereign was deemed absolute; and that his person was regarded with almost sacred respect. The kings of Persia, from the most early ages, have assumed extravagant titles, and lived with great splendour: but they have been always subject to the check, and sometimes to the control, of a military nobility; many of whom, descended from the royal family, held the richest provinces of their kingdom as principalities. It would appear, that in the most ancient times these nobles were always assembled before a monarch was placed upon the throne. Their assent was in fact necessary, as they were from birth the leaders of the army of the country, which was formed from the different quotas that they furnished. The immediate ministers of the crown seem, as at present, to have been generally chosen from men of learning and experience, but of low birth. Ministerial power was often usurped by chiefs of great family, but never granted: its being in the hands of a powerful military noble implies, in such a government, that the prince is a pageant or a prisoner. The luxury in which Persian kings have always indulged, extended to the nobility of that country; an°d in prosperous times, it must have been generally diffused over the whole empire. That this luxury could not have existed without a knowledge of many of the arts of peace, and a certain progress in civilisation, is obvious: but this progress was continually retarded by the internal wars consequent to the system of the government, and by the recurring irruptions of savage tribes of warriors, who issued, vol. i. 2 m2 qq THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . in one quarter, from the shores of the Euxine and the Caspian, and j n an other, from the banks of the Oxus and Jaxartes. There would appear every ground to conclude that the form of the ancient government of Persia was nearly the same as that of all barbarous states, the foundation of whose greatness is military power: but there is, perhaps, no better way of judging the condition of a people than by a reference to the mode in which the ruler collects Ancient mode the revenue from those subject to his authority. The collection of 'ft:: the revenues of Persia, we are informed^, was first settled by Darius Hystaspesf, when he divided his kingdom into twenty great satra pies J. That monarch fixed the regular tribute to be paid by each of these inferior governments. This, the same author tells us, was an innovation: he adds, that Cyrus only received presents: and that, in consequence of this new measure, Darius was termed a merchant; while Cyrus was considered by his subjects as a parent 1]. The propriety of these appellations must refer to the personal character of the sovereigns to whom they were applied, not to the system of collecting the revenue which they adopted : for certainly that pursued by Cyrus was at once the rudest, the most uncertain, and * Herodotus. t The Gushtasp of oriental writers. % Darius Hystaspes divided Persia into twenty satrapies, or governments: and, according to the authority of Herodotus, he fixed its revenue at an amount equal to two millions eight hundred and seven thousand four hundred and thirty-seven pounds of our money; a sum which Doctor Robertson deems so small, as to be almost irrecon cilable with the many facts concerning the mines, magnificence, and luxury of the East. The learned historian would be surprised to learn, that this amount corresponds almost to a fraction with the revenue which is, at this moment, collected in Persia: and that kingdom is certainly at this period in a prosperous condition. H Cambyses, who also took presents, is termed, in the same passage, a despot.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ the most oppressive. We are told that it existed in Persia even chap, vil before his reign, and it has continued to the present day to be the bane of that kingdom. The sovereign, on his ascending the throne on the annual festival of the feast of Nowroze*, or com mencement of the year, and on the occurrence of any fortunate event, such as the birth of a son, or a marriage in the royal family, expects, or, to speak more correctly, exacts a present from his powerful nobles and officers of state; and these follow the same system with their vassals and dependants. The amount of such present is arbitrary. It is regulated by the dictates of avarice, the possession of wealth, the power to oppress, and the means of resist ance : and the collision of these opposite causes of action must always produce effects the most unfavourable that can be conceived for a nations happiness. With regard to the laws of the ancient Persians, if we are to Ancient w understand by that term, civil institutions, which are made for the llJ** Per ' punishment of criminals according to established usages, and to guard the lives and property of individuals from injustice and power, we may safely pronounce that they never could have existed in a nation which was always under despotic rulers: but, on examina tion of those passages of holy writ in which the laws of the Medes and Persians are mentioned, it will be discovered that the king's word was, in the most ancient days as at present, deemed the fixed and immutable law of the land; and that no more was meant by that phrase, than that when the monarch had once commanded, though it * This feast, as has been before stated, is supposed to have been first instituted by Jemsheed.268 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vir. was to commit injustice, he even could not depart from what he had uttered*. Habitation. That the greatest part of the population of ancient Persia inhabited towns and cities, is proved both by history and by the antiquity of some of the most extensive ruins which have been dis covered in that country; and we are led to conclude, that in the earliest age of which the Persians have any trace, they must have depended more upon agriculture than on their flocks for their support: for, we are informed, they long regarded those who ate animal food with horror-f*; but we learn from the same authorities, that even in those days a number of tribes used to dwell in tents. The nature, * Many passages from the Bible might be quoted to prove the truth of this plain interpretation : that of Daniel being cast into the lions' den is one of the most remarkable. The character of the power of the King of Persia has undergone no change. The late king, Aga Mahomed Khan, when encamped near Shiraz, said he would not move till the snow was off the mountain in the vicinity of his camp. The season proved severe, and the snow remained longer than was expected: the army began to suffer distress and sickness: but the king had said, while the snow remained upon the mountain, he would not move: and his word was as law, and could not be broken. A multitude of labourers were collected and sent to remove the snow: their efforts, and a few fine days, cleared the mountain, and Aga Mahomed Khan marched. This anecdote was repeated to me by one of his principal chiefs, who was present, and who told it me with a desire of impressing my mind with a high opinion of Aga Mahomed Khan, who knew, he observed, the sacred nature of a word spoken by the King of Persia. f Zohauk, as has been stated, was the first who introduced this usage; but perhaps it was only some of the higher classes, or the order of priests, (as is the case in India,) that lived upon vegetables and milk: but as these were the recorders of this innova tion, they would ascribe their feelings of horror to the whole nation.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^69 indeed, of the soil and the climate of Persia is singularly favourable chap, vil to such a life: and the character of the government of that countrv , , . . it . Wandering must always have given it additional charms. The wandering tribes tribes, can enjoy, by moving their tents from elevated to low plains, a con tinual spring; but their favourite residence has always been amid high and inaccessible mountains. They are reconciled by habit to privations which the hand of power can hardly increase: and their manner of life inspires them with a savage freedom, that only admits of the exercise of a very lenient authority. That of their chiefs is patriarchal: they repay his kindness with inviolable attachment: but, from impatience of insult and oppression, they are prompt to disobe dience and revolt. Enemies of learning, and careless of religion, they disdain improvement; and look down from the summits of their barren mountains with a mixture of pity and contempt upon the luxurious, but enslaved inhabitants of splendid cities. The character of such a race can never change: and there is probably no difference between the ancient and present Eellyattee, or man of a wandering tribe, in Persia, except that the former ascended a mountain to adore the sun, or pronounced in a temple of fire the name of Zoroaster ; while the latter repeats that of Mahomed, and murmurs a short and hurried prayer in a language* of which he is ignorant. There is every reason to believe, that the manners of the ancient Observations inhabitants of Persia were softened, and in some degree refined, by ° r n ess th 0 e f JX a spirit of chivalry which prevailed throughout that country, from Iisation • the commencement till the end of the Kaianian dynasty. The quality of courage was hardly held higher than that of generosity # Arabic.270 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. vii . and humanity: and we find the first heroes not more praised for valour than for their clemency and munificence. If we give any credit to Ferdosi, most of the laws of modern honour appear to have been understood and practised with an exception in favour of the ancient Persians, whose duels or combats (which were frequent) were generally with the most distinguished among the enemies of their country, or of the human race. The great respect in which the female sex was held, was, no doubt, the principal cause of the progress they had made in civilisation. These were at once the cause of generous enterprise and its reward. It would appear, that in former days the women of Persia had an assigned and honourable* place in Societyand we must conclude, that an equal rank with the male creation, which is secured to them by the ordinances of Zoroaster, existed long before the time of that reformer, who paid too great attention to the habits and prejudices of his countrymen, to have made any serious alteration in so important an usage. Though there is reason, from what has been said, to conclude that the inhabitants of ancient Persia had made some progress in civilisation, and that a spirit of generous valour was cherished among the higher orders of the military class of that country, there is no ground to suppose that the community ever enjoyed a good government, or just laws. In the more remote ages, the power of the sovereign was but faintly acknowledged by great * We are told by Quintus Curtius, that Alexander would not sit in the presence of Sisygambis till told to do so by that matron; because it was not the custom in Persia for sons to sit in presence of their mothers.

This, which appears to have been the first rude state of every monarchy in the universe, was changed, as the paramount chief, or king, gained strength: but when the various petty princes, or lords of provinces and of tribes, were subdued, the only government that an absolute ruler of such a country could substitute, led, by a natural course, to the same state of affairs at which the labour had commenced. It was a progress, not on a line that advanced, but on that of a circle, which terminated where it began. The wisest and most powerful monarchs of Persia, as has been shown, knew no other mode of settling their empire but that of dividing it into petty governments, each of which was ruled by a lieutenant, or officer, whom western writers call satrap*, and who held his government on condition of paying certain revenues, and of furnishing a fixed quota of troops. As the sovereign power became weak, it was evident its officers would usurp upon it, and the result would be the establishment of families, strong from influence and wealth, and the fall of the monarchy by the insurrections * This appears to be a corruption of chattrapa, or ' lord of the umbrella of state,' which, it is probable, these provincial rulers only were allowed to bear. The distinc tion of bearing an umbrella is common to many countries of Asia; and that it was known in Persia, there can be no better evidence than the sculpture of Persepolis, where the umbrella of state often marks the prince, or chief, of the group of figures. Chattra, which signifies ' umbrella,' is a term common to Persic and Shanscrit. Pa, a contraction of pati, (i. e. lord,) is now lost in the former, though preserved in the latter language. The name, or rather title, of chattra pati, or ' lord of the umbrella,' dis tinguishes one of the highest officers of the federal government of the Mahratta state.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. and rebellions of those petty principalities which it had reduced and recreated. This, however, is an outline which describes the condition of every uncivilized state in the world: but it is obvious, that no nation to which it applies can be said to possess either good laws or good government. With regard to the morals of the inhabitants of ancient Persia, we are left entirely in the dark. The historians of that nation never write of common men : and it is perhaps unfair to judge of the mass by what we find recorded of their kings and heroes. If we should, the sentence would not be favourable. But such illustrious personages have, in all ages, and in all countries, deemed themselves exempt from vulgar restrictions: and we can only observe, that if the example they gave was generally followed, the morals of the Persians could not have been much better than their government and their laws. It is difficult to say to what extent learning was cultivated among the ancient Persians. Nousheerwan was the first monarch whom historians notice as the founder of a college: but the mobuds, or priests, had their books of religion; and the Chronicles of the Kings of Persia were preserved with great care. The learned of this nation were early distinguished for their knowledge of astrology, which implies a limited acquaintance with the noble science of astronomy : but this study, as well as all others, appears to have been confined to their mobuds, or priests: and it is evident that their boasted learning, under the greatest of the Sassanian kings, was much below that of their western neighbours; for we are told, that the philosophers of the Roman empire returned disappointedTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ from the court of Nousheerwan*. Whatever treasures in science chap. vii. and learning the ancient Persians might have possessed, are lost or destroyed-f*: and it will not appear illiberal to conclude, that the reputation of the country has owed much to a loss, which has given rise to a regret that is disposed to magnify the value of what it can not hope to recover. The ancient Persian must, from his climate and food, have been athletic and strong, and of good personal appearance. An author of just fame J, who has probably taken his comparison from some of the oppressed followers of Zoroaster, who still remain in that country, and whose very looks have been changed by their hard condition, has pronounced that the former inhabitants of this kingdom were inferior to the modern, whose beauty of frame has, he conceives, been improved by the blood of the Georgians, Circassians, and other nations with whom they have intermingled. But, if we are to judge from the descendants of the ancient Persians * Gibbon. t I never have been able to hear of the existence of any work in the ancient Pehlivi that could be deemed historical. Sir John Chardin informs us, that Abbas the Great made every possible search after manuscripts in that language; and that he actually put one of the priests of the Guebers to death in consequence of his disap pointment. The collection made by this monarch amounted to twenty-six volumes; and Chardin informs us, that they were lodged in the Royal Library at Isfahan. The respectable traveller gives us a plate, said to be taken from these volumes: it only exhibits a specimen of the kufick and arrow-headed characters. He also states, that a Gueber read to him, for three months, out of a book relating to their religion and usages, said to have been written in the time of Yezdijird. I can have no doubt that this was one of their books of Rowayat, or ordinances, of which the Gueber priests at Yezd, and at Bombay, have several. J Sir J.

An Account of the Government of the Caliphs in Persia, and of the Petty Dynasties of Ben Leis, Samanee, and Dilemee. We now commence a new era in Persian history. The arms of the chap. viii. followers of Mahomed effected a great revolution in that country: but, though its religion was completely changed, and the manners of a.h.si.' its inhabitants much altered, the government continued essentially the same. There is so little left regarding ancient Persia, that a fear of even neglecting trifles, which might throw a light upon such an epoch, may have led to prolixity on that part of the subject. From its conquest by the Arabians, to the reign of Nadir Shah, it will be sufficient to give a general and concise account of the numerous dynasties which governed that kingdom. From the elevation of Nadir, more detail will be necessary, as every event will then derive an importance, from its connexion with the present state of that kingdom. In the modern part of Persian history, we cannot complain of the character of want of materials : but the best Mahomedan authors are only entitled tory!™ ' 15 ' to the character of good annalists. They give the occurrences of the year with exactness, and sometimes enliven the record with a few characteristic anecdotes of the monarchs whose history they write. But, though their style is often remarkable for its perspicuity, and2^5 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vm. the facts they state may be depended upon, (unless when writing of those princes under whose protection they lived,) their page can seldom boast of much interest. A Persian author, it is true, is in general exempt from a political bias: and though his volume may have the colour of his religious feelings, it is never written to support any system, and can therefore hardly ever mislead: but this negative merit arises out of the scenes amid which he lives, and the actions that he has to detail. Asiatic historians seldom speculate upon changes in the manners of men, in the frame of society, or on the form of governments. They are entire strangers to the science of political economy, and never reason upon any subject connected with the rise or fall of nations, except with reference to the personal character of their rulers. It must be obvious, that such writers, though they may be more free from error, can never attain any portion of that excellence which belongs to those who, living under happier auspices, have mixed the wisdom of philosophy with the facts of history in a manner which has enabled them to instruct future ages, by their narration of the events of the past. From what has been said, it will appear that the defects of eastern history are not to be ascribed to any want of talents in its authors, but to the condition of the society in which they lived, and to the subjects of which they treat. The tale of despotism, which is the only one they have to tell, is always the same: and the quick succession of absolute monarchs, and servile ministers, often render the volumes which record their lives a mere catalogue of names and of crimes. The difficulty of constructing a work from such materials is great, and it is hardly lessened by their abundance.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ After the flight of Yezdijird, the leaders of the armies of the chap . vm. caliph soon overran the whole of Persia, from the Euphrates to the Oxus, destroying, with bigot fury, all that was useful, grand, or ^itnLTof sacred, in that unhappy country. A great proportion of the con- thecaliphs - quered inhabitants, preferring the abandonment of their religious tenets to oppression or death, adopted the faith of their new masters; while those who were unable to endure the scene, fled, self-banished, into a distant land. The progress of the conquerors was rapid and wonderful: colonies, from the burning desert of Arabia, were extended over the cold countries of Khorassan and Bulkh: and they flourished in the soil to which they were trans planted. Their descendants still remain a distinct race*, and con tinue to preserve the manner and the appearance, though they have lost the language, of their forefathers. When the great conquest was complete, lieutenants were appointed to the different divisions of the country; and Persia was held as a province, under the vast empire of the Arabian caliphs, for more than two centuries. Its history, during that period, is to be found in that of its conquerors; and even there it occupies but a small and unimportant space. The only events of consequence, are petty revolts of insubordinate governors, who, when * I have conversed with a man of the tribe of Ben-Shyhanee, who belonged to a branch of that tribe, settled within four days' march of Bokharah : his countenance and manner were as completely Arabian as an inhabitant of Yemen, which he accounted for by saying, that none of his tribe intermarried with the other inhabitants of the country. The Arabs, in Khorassan, in Bulkh, and even in the vicinity of Bokharah, are still numerous: but, except in the former province, they have no chiefs of any distinction, it having been the policy of both the Tartars and Affghans to scatter and weaken them. Though many of these tribes have preserved the name and appearance of Arabians, they have completely lost the language of that country.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. S/o chap . vin. the power of the caliphs declined, tried to render the provinces to which they were appointed hereditary principalities, and humbled themselves to that paramount power when it was strong and efficient. a. d. 810. In the government of Khorassan we trace three generations AH ' 195 ' descended from Tahir* who exercised almost regal power: and when the caliph, Mamoon, desired to remove the grandson of Tahir, he was compelled to employ an uncle of that governor to attack him; a strong presumptive proof, that this system had already created a number of great feudatory lords, or chiefs, over whom the caliphs could only maintain their nominal authority by the wretched expedient of exciting feudal and family divisions. A country could not long remain in such a state. The fever of religious enthusiasm soon passed : the person of the caliph was no longer held sacred, nor his mandate obeyed with that implicit obedience which the followers of Mahomed gave to his first successors. He had become a pageant, who resided at his palace in Bagdad, and acted by the direction of some chief who was a nominal slave of his authority. His temporal power was at as low an ebb as his religious: * The story of the two sons of the celebrated Haroun-ul-Rusheed, is familiar to every reader of oriental history. The caliph, Ameen, the son of the beautiful, virtuous, and high-born Zobiedah, was the weakest and most wretched of men; while his brother, Mamoon, whose mother was a slave, commanded the esteem of all, by his courage, enterprise, and wisdom. Their father, respecting the descent of the one, and the character of the other, left his empire between them: but Ameen not only tried to degrade his brother from that high dignity, by leaving his name out of the public prayers, but sent an army to destroy him. The fortunes of Mamoon were intrusted to the skill and valour of Tahir-zul-Yemneen, who defeated the army of the caliph, Ameen, and afterwards slew that prince.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 27g and his discontented and mutinous armies were hardly able to pro- chap . vni. tect, from usurpation, the districts in the immediate vicinity of his capital, much less to hold in subjection distant provinces, whose governors used his name in public prayers, but disdained to give any further mark of their duty or their allegiance. The sceptre of the once proud kingdom of Persia, thus fallen from the nerveless grasp of the despicable successors of Omar and of Aly, seemed to present itself to any bold leader who had the courage to seize it. So dazzling a prize must have tempted many to their ruin. It was at last obtained by a man who, though born in the lowest ranks of life, was ennobled by the qualities of valour, generosity, and wisdom. Yacoob-ben-Leis was the son of a Early life of pewterer of the name of Leis, in Seistan. He worked, when very ^ ob ' ben ' young, at his father's trade: but all his gains, and all he could obtain from an indulgent parent, were squandered among a number of boys of the same age, with whom his boldness and prodigality made him a favourite. As he grew up, his means became unequal to his increased wants, and those of his young friends, whom he was in the habits of supplying. Tempted by the distracted state of the country, he became a robber; and was followed, in this desperate profession. Becomes a by those whom his liberality from childhood had attached to his robber ' person and fortunes. The number and character of his followers, and the success of his enterprises, soon gave him fame and wealth; and his generous and humane usage of those whom he plundered, added to his name and popularity. In such a state of society, the transition from the condition of a successful robber to that of a chief of reputation, was easy and natural. A man who possessed activity and courage, and who was able to command a number of adherents,280 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vm. could not fail of early attaining rank and consequence. Salah- ebn-Naser, who had usurped the government of Seistan, when STonTaiX threatened by an attack from Tahir-ebn-AbdulIah, ruler of Kho- ' a ' S ssi . rassan, was glad to obtain the services of the robber, Yacoob; who a. h . 237. rose so ra pi ( iiy to power, that he was intrusted by Dirhem-ebn- Naser, the successor of his brother Salah, with the command of his army. The first use which he made of this power, was to seize* the chief that had bestowed it upon him, whom he sent prisoner to Usurpsthego- Bagdad, and claimed, as a recompense for his success in displacing SeTsun!' 1 0f a rebellious ruler, the government of his native province, which he promised to hold as the servant and lieutenant of the Lord of the Faithful.

He was murdered as he was drinking with his friends. His vizier, Futteh, seeing he could not defend his master, exclaimed, ' 0 ' Mutawukel! I do not desire to survive thee!' and received from a conspirator the death he wished. Mutawukel had a jester, as all Asiatic princes have. This man, when he saw the work of death commence, crept into a corner: but when he observed the vizier's fate, he rushed out, and, imitating his solemnity of manner, exclaimed,' 0 ' Mutawukel!

When he returned from this expedition, he sent a present to Muatamed-ul-ullah*, the son of Mutawukel, who then sat upon the throne of Bagdad, by an officer, who was commanded to say, that Yacoob considered himself as one of the lowest of the caliph's slavesf. This mission, however, did not prevent the caliph from remonstrating with that chief, ^vhen he again invaded Fars : and an offer was made to grant him, if he desisted from the enterprise, a regular investiture for the government of the countries of Bulkh and of Bokharah, in addition to that which he held of Seistan.

When it reached the camp of that leader, he lay dangerously ill of a painful complaint.

His contempt of luxury, combined with the qualities of courage and firmness, which he possessed in a very eminent degree, appear to have rendered him worthy of a success, that he never abused by any wanton act of cruelty or oppression. But we read the history of Yacoob from very partial historians. The Persians, warmly attached to the principles of the Sheah sect, are delighted with a chief who made so formidable an attack upon the power of the Sunnee caliphs. They relate the following anecdote of Yacoob, as a proof of his attachment to their opinions. He was one day informed that Abou Yusoof, an officer of his army, had cursed Osman*: conceiving the personage cursed was Osman Sunjuree, a cotemporary ruler, with whom he was on terms of friendship, he immediately ordered Yusoof to be brought before him, and punished. His vizier (who was a Sunnee) desired to inflame his anger, and pointing at the prisoner, exclaimed: ' There is the man who has dared, with profane lips, to curse &lt;c the holy companion of our prophet' I have been acting ' under a mistake,' said Yacoob, with a smile; ' I thought it was ' another great personage he had abused : release Abou Yusoof, I « have no alliance with that Osmanf!'

Amer*, the brother and successor of Yacoob, showed a very Amer suo different disposition to what that chief had done in his conduct b^r 0b ' towards the caliph, to whom he addressed a respectful letter, and readily consented to hold Irak-Ajum, Fars, Khorassan, Seistan, and Taberistan; or, in other words, the kingdom of Persia, as the nominal slave of the Lord of the Faithful. We are toldf, that, soon after his accession, Amer directed every commander of a thousand horse to appear with a golden mace in his hand; and when he saw a hundred chiefs with this mark of their rank, he sighed inwardly, and exclaimed: « Oh! that Providence had ' permitted me to lead an army like this to the defence of Hus- ' sein and Hassan J on the plains of Kerbelah!' This pious wish has, according to Mahomedan writers, given to this prince a high place in the regions of eternal bliss. For some years, the affairs of Amer prospered: he continued to acknowledge the authority, and to send annual presents to the caliph: and he performed, by deputy, the duties of Governor of Bagdad, the chief station in the empire.

The afFairs of the court at Bagdad were entirely conducted, at this period, by Muaffick, the brother of Muatamed.

The disappointed chief no sooner reached his army, (which was encamped at Jelwan, in the vicinity of Bagdad,) than he commanded a retreat. The caliph, irritated at this attempt, and anxious to weaken the power of so dangerous a subject, instigated a Tartar lord, named Ismail Samanee, who had already gained great fame by his exploits in his own country, to usurp the government of Transoxania. Amer detached one of his generals against Ismail: and, when he was a. d. 900. defeated, determined (contrary to the advice of all his counsellors,) A ' H ' S88 * to cross the Oxus himself.

That prince fled, but his horse having fallen, soner^byTs- he was made prisoner. The change of fortune was immense; mail Samanee. ^ the reverse was mar ked by a trifling occurrence of so ludicrous a nature, that even the unfortunate Amer was compelled to mirth, at 4he astonishing alteration that a few hours had made in his condition. While he sat upon the ground, a soldier prepared a coarse meal to appease his hunger: as this was boiling in one of the pots used for the food of the horses, a dog put his head into it, but, from the mouth of the vessel being small, he could not draw it out again, and ran away with both the pot and the meat. The captive monarch burst into a fit of laughter: and on one of his guards demanding what cause upon earth could induce a person in his situation to laugh, he replied : ' It was but this morning the « steward of my household complained that three hundred camels ' were not enough to carry my kitchen furniture: how easily is it ' now borne by that dog, who has carried away both my cooking ' utensils and dinnerf!'

Amer enjoyed power for twenty-three years. He used one means ni s go'vlT- to preserve it, not unsuited to the nature of his government; he pur- ™ a ^ ndcha ' chased numbers of young slaves, had them carefully educated, and then presented them to his principal military and civil officers; and from these private agents, (who were brought up to be spies,) he knew all that passed, and was so well acquainted with the secrets of the families of his chiefs, that many, not aware of his means of information, believed him to possess supernatural knowledge. Though Amer had none of the great qualities of his brother Yacoob, he was not deficient in either courage or good sense: his disposition is said to have been cheerful; and, as an instance, it is relatedf, that when he was reviewing his army, seeing a man mounted upon a very lean horse, he exclaimed: ' My soldiers have all lean horses and fat wives/'—' My wife,' said the person to whom the speech alluded, ' is much leaner than my horse; and, if your majesty doubts my ' assertion, I will bring her to muster.' The prince smiled, and gave the fellow some money, desiring him to fatten both. With Amer fell the fortunes of this family. His grandson, Taher, struggled for power in his native province: but after a reign of six years, during which he conquered part of Fars, his authority was subverted by one of his # Some authors deny this, and say he was released at the death of his caliph, f Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. vol. i. 2 p390 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , vm. own officers, by whom he was seized, and sent prisoner to Bagdad. The only other prince of the family of Ben Leis that attained any eminence, was a chief of the name of Kuliph*; who, with the aid of Munsoor Samanee, established himself in Seistan, and maintained his power over that province till the period of Mahmood, of Ghizni, by whom he was defeated and made prisoner. The history and character of this last prince of the family of Ben Leis are completely at variance: and we read in the same page that recounts his barbarous and inhuman actions f, the most extravagant # Kuliph was descended from Yacoob-ben-Leis in the female line, f We are told by the author of the Zeenut-ul-Tuarikb, that the great object of the ambition of Kuliph was to conquer the neighbouring province of Kerman, then held by the Dilemee family. His army, which was commanded by his eldest son, was at first successful, but afterwards defeated with great loss: and, when its leader returned to Seistan, he was slain by his merciless father, who, after this unnatural act, pretended to mourn over the body, and insisted upon his right to revenge the blood of the youth upon the ruler of Fars, who had compelled him, he said, to commit this murder. But he in vain entreated the inhabitants of Seistan to make a second attack upon Kerman. In this dilemma, he fell upon an expedient suited to the atrocity of his character. The cazy, or chief judge of Seistan, was deservedly popular from his justice and piety. Kuliph entreated this old man to proceed upon a peaceable mission to Kerman, to settle, by an amicable negotiation, all differences with that country. The cazy, delighted at the prospect of doing good, assented to his request: but, after his first conference with the ruler of Kerman, he was poisoned by the secret agents of Kuliph, who instantly spread a report, that this horrid outrage was the act of the inhabitants of Kerman ; and, while this was believed, he found no difficulty in raising an army. The inhabitants of Seistan readily enrolled themselves, to revenge their venerable and beloved magistrate: and their fury gave them success. Kerman was subdued: but the son of Kuliph, who commanded his troops, threw off all allegiance to his father, whose enormous guilt he had probably discovered. Kuliph marched to reduce his son: but he was deserted by his followers, and compelled to shut himself up in a fort, where heTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 2gl praises of his great wisdom, and unbounded liberality. These chap . vnr. apparent contradictions are easily reconciled. This prince live(J in the Augustan age of Persian literature, when the example of that munificent patronage, which the rojal families of Saman and of Ghizni extended to men of learning and of genius, was imitated by every petty ruler of a province; and none of those appear to have lavished their bounty with more judgment than Kuliph; for we find a name, that should have been handed down to the detestation of posterity, covered by historians with a veil of panegyric, and enshrined by poets in the temple of virtue. was upon the point of being taken, when he pretended to fall sick, and affected such excruciating pain, that all who were near him thought he was at the point of death. In this situation, he sent the following message to his son. ' A few hours must termi- « nate my existence: I have none but you to whom I can leave what I have in this world, either of power or of wealth. The hoarded treasures of our family must not ' pass into a stranger's hands. Hasten to receive my last blessing, and to learn where all that I possess is concealed.' The youth was completely deceived, and hurried to his father; who, the moment his son was close to him, sprung up, and stabbed him to the heart. This act proclaimed his recovery; and he returned to his capital amid the execrations of his subjects, who soon afterwards invited Mahmood, of Ghizni, to seize Seistan. That monarch accepted the invitation, and advanced with a large army into the province. Kuhph, deserted by his followers, could make little resistance against so formidable an attack : he shut himself up in the strong fort of Taak, of which Mah mood instantly undertook the siege. The ditch was filled with faggots of wood, and the gate almost destroyed by an elephant, before Kuliph solicited mercy. We are told, that, when praying for pardon, he addressed Mahmood by the high name of sultan. The new title was grateful to the monarch's ear, and recommended him who had used it to clemency; and the last of the family of Yacoob-ben-Leis, that is noticed in history, was sent to Ghizni, where he lived four years, and died a natural death. The above is the substance of this prince's life, as given in the Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh.292 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. viit . From the date of the downfal of the House of Ben. Leis to that of the rise of the celebrated Sultan Mahmood, of Ghizni, is a period of a! h . 289. near a century; during which the empire of Persia was divided between two families, the Samanee and Dilemee* The power of the dynasty of the Samanees extended over Khorassan, Seistan, Bulkh, and the countries of Transoxania, including the cities of Bokharah and Samarcund: and they at times possessed, and often ravaged, part of Irak. This race, though originally raised by the favour of the caliphs, threw off, in the pride of power, even nominal allegiance to those sovereigns ; while their rivals and enemies of the family of Dilemee, always acknowledged the supremacy of the caliphs: and, during the whole period of their rule, one of this family was vizier of the empire, and consequently vested with the management of affairs at Bagdad. But though the Dilemee princes styled themselves the slaves of the Lord of the Faithful, they exercised sovereign power over the greatest part of Irak, Fars, Kerman, Khuzistan, and Laris- tan, making peace and war as independent princes. This family survived, though with reduced power, the dynasty of the Samanee, and were not wholly destroyed till the capture of Bagdad by Togrul Beg, the founder of the House of Seljookee. The minute history of the wars of the monarchs of these dynasties, and of those of their real and nominal dependants, would be alike useless and uninteresting. A short account of the founders of each family; of the characters of some of the most distinguished princes; and of the most striking events that marked their rule, will throw every light that can be desired on such a period.

Bagdad invested Nasr with the government of Maver-ul-Naher, in the hope that the elevation of so powerful a rival would check designs which aimed at the destruction of the caliphate. Nasr accepted the situation : but, not desiring to leave Samarcund, sent one of his younger brothers, whose name was Ismail, to Bokharah. Ismail established an intimate friendship with RafFeah*, an officer who then ruled Khorassan, and through his influence obtained the Makes war government of Khaurizm in addition to that of Bokharah. Nasr, Z^maiT' who was easily persuaded that this act of his brother was only a prelude to an attack upon Samarcund, assembled an army to reduce him. Ismail called upon his friend, Raffeah, who joined him in person, and succeeded in negotiating a peace between the two brothers ; but it was not of long duration: Nasr again took the Bywhomheis field: he advanced to Bokharah, where his army was defeated, and defeated, and he himself fell into the hands of Ismailj w ho, instead of treating him with severity, refused even to be seated in the presence of an elder brother, whom he declared he still loved and respected, how- * RafFeah was a deputy of Mahomed-ben-Zeyd Alavee, who has been before mentioned.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ ever much he considered him to have been deluded by bad advisers, chap. viii. Ismail not only gave Nasr his full liberty, but insisted upon his returning to Samarcund to resume his government, saying, he should t hTsgovern- be quite content to hold that of Bokharah as his lieutenant. Nasr ment • at first could not be convinced that his brother was serious in his professions; but when he found by his actions that he was sincere, gra titude and admiration took entire dominion of his heart, and he con- a. d. 892. tinued, till his death, to cherish the warmest fraternal feelings towards A H 279 Ismail. That chief was, if possible, more distinguished for his valour than his generosity, as nothing but heroic courage could have given him the decisive victory he obtained over Amer-ben-Leis, whom he engaged, as has been before related, with less than half his numbers. After this action, the power of Ismail was established* over Kho- rassan, Bulkh, and Seistan, as well as Samarcund, Bokharah, and Khaurizm. He had, before it was fought, obtained great fame by the success of an expedition against a chief in Tartary, styled the King of Turkistan, whose territories were situated beyond the Jaxartes.

A short period after he had conquered Amer, Ismail subdued the city and province of Rhe, the whole of Taberistan, and part of Irak. After his return from the invasion of Persia, he again advanced into the north-eastern parts of Tartary, and subjected many provinces in that quarter to his rule. His death.

That wicked act has rendered your downfal as « rapid as your rise. Seek not to make my fate like yours, which ' it would be, if I soiled my hands with such sacrilegious wealthf.' But the virtue of this prince endured a still more severe trial. His army, after he had taken Herat, was in a state of the most extreme distress for want of money. Ismail had given his word not to levy a contribution upon that city; but the clamours of his soldiers loudly demanded that he should consider their merits and their wants before a faith that had been, they argued, too hastily pledged. Ismail was, * This share, which is stated to have been independent of horses and camels, amounts to thirty-one pounds five shillings, calculating the dirhem at five pence half- penny each. t Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^97 however, firm : and as the army became every hour more distressed chap . viir. and discontented, he ordered them to march away, lest the tempta- tion to violate his word, which he had ever held sacred, should be too great. He had gone, we are told by Persian historians*, but a short distance, when a ruby necklace of one of his ladies was carried away by a vulture, by which, from its red appearance, it was mistaken for meat. The bird was watched, and at last seen to deposit the jewel in a dry well, which was immediately searched. The necklace was recovered, and several boxes of treasure were found lying near it, which proved to be part of the wealth of Amer, that his servant, Sam, had stolen from his palace at Seistan. The monarch rejoiced at this boon of fortune. He instantly paid his army, and bade them take a lesson from what had happened, and learn, that God would never desert that man who withstood temptation, and preserved inviolate the faith that he had solemnly pledged-f. Ismail was succeeded by his son, Ahmed J, an inglorious and Ismail is suc- ci'uel prince, who contended with his uncle, his brothers, and other Zml by * This tale is, I believe, told by almost all Persian historians: they have copied it from each other.

The ruler of Bokharah amply rewarded his friends. Subuctageen was honoured with the title of Nasr-u- deen, or ' the victorious of the faith/' and his son, with that of Syf-u-doulah, or « the sword of the state.' But to the latter, a more substantial favour was added. The young Mahmood was made Governor of Khorassan, and instantly proceeded with his father to take possession of that province, which he held during the lifef of Ameer Noahf.

Their rise must have been very rapid; for we find, a few years afterwards, when Muravij, the son and successor of Asfar, was assassinated, that Aly Buyah, the eldest son of Shnjah, A^ah. was m the command of the chief part of his army, with which he encountered and defeated Yakoot, who was one of the caliph's lieute nants, and governor of Isfahan ; and by the immense plunder that he obtained from that victory, he became at once a leader of reputa- tion and of power.

The Caliph Mustukhfy fled, but was soon induced to return: and his first tlltt act was to heap honours on those who had taken possession of his capital. Aly Buyah, on agreeing to pay annually six hundred thousand dinars of goldf, was appointed viceroy of Fars and Irak, with the rank of Ameer-ul-Omrah J, and the title of Umud-u-dowlah {{. Equal rank was given to his younger brother, Ahmed, who received the title of Muaz-u-dowlahi and was nominated vizier to the caliph; an appointment which, at that period, implied the government of Bagdad, and the few provinces subject to it, with the conduct of all affairs connected with the management of the little influence that the caliphs retained over the different usurpers of their extensive, but nominal domi nions 1[. Hassan, who was his second brother, received the title of Rukun-ul-doulah, (pillar of the state,) and acted, during the life of Aly Buyah, under that chief. The rise of this family was, in a great degree, owing to the possession of the treasures of Yakoot, the former Governor of Fars, which accident gave to Aly Buyah.

But, according to Persian authors, this was not the only instance of his good fortune. One day a tailor, who had served the former governor, had come to make him some clothes: he happened to call for a stick, meaning a measure; but the guilty conscience of the tailor gave another inter pretation to this word, and he exclaimed, as he threw himself upon the ground, ' Be merciful! do not flog me to death, and I will ' discover all the cloth belonging to Yakoot!' The surprised Aly Buyah bade him do so; and the man produced seventeen chests of cloth belonging to the former governor, which he had purloined at his flight*. This discovery caused a strict scrutiny, which produced many others of a similar nature: and Aly Buyah became possessed of the wealth and means that enabled him to enlarge his power. His elder brother, Murdaveenee, envious of his good fortune, advanced to attack him; but he was slain by his own servants; and left Aly Buyah, without a rival, in possession of all the countries from Kho- rassan to the vicinity of Bagdad. He was ably supported, in the power he had acquired, by his brother, Muaz-u-doulah; who, after dethroning the Caliph Mustukhfy, continued through life to exercise A D 945 absolute authorityf over Mothi, the son of Mocktadir, whom he A H - S34 ' * Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh and Khondemir. f Muaz-u-doulah, who was a bigoted adherent to the sect of Aly, when his power was fully established, commanded that the first ten days of the month of Mohurrum should be set aside for a general mourning over the fate of Hussein, the son of Aly, who was slain on the plains of Kerbellah, in the sixtieth year of the Hejirah, The vol. i. 2 rso q THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . vm. elevated to the throne. Aly Buyah had no children: and when he found his end approach, he requested his brother, Rukun-u-doulah, a. h. 337.

No prince was ever more deeply character. re g ret ted by his subjects : he had used the favours of fortune with singular moderation: and the good understanding upon which he lived with his brothers, Muaz-u-doulah and Rukun-u-doulah, while it promoted his success, is a proof of that kindness and generosity of temper which all Persian historians have ascribed to Is succeeded this ruler. He was succeeded by his brother, Rukun-u-doulah; who, doukh. however, continued to reside in Irak, and gave over the charge of the affairs of Pars to his eldest son, Azud-u-doulah: and at his death, though he divided the territories he possessed among his sons, he Azud-u-dou- commanded they should all yield obedience to that prince.

This great man enjoyed, till chap, viil his death, this extensive power over a part of Arabia and the finest provinces of Persia. He was treated by neighbouring princes as a vizier to the sovereign*, which he in fact was; although respect for the prejudices Cahph ' of the age made him retain the title of Slave of the Lord of the Faithful, and appear only as the minister of the pageant caliph. He greatly improved the capital of the empire, carefully repairing improvements all the damages it had sustained from sieges. He discontinued the ^adttyhhT tax upon religious pilgrims, and restored the sacred buildings at Medinah, Kerbelah, and NujufF, to their former splendour. He also built hospitals for the poor in the City of Bagdad; to which he appointed physicians, with regular salaries; and purchased a sufficient quantity of medicines for the annual use of these charitable insti tutions f. This prince was alike attentive to the prosperity of Irak and Fars, as he was to the provinces of Arabia: and all the evils which these had suffered from preceding wars, were repaired under his long and happy rule. The most remarkable of his works that now remain, is a dyke over the river KurJ, which passes through the plain of Murdasht.

Historians, however partial to the memory of this prince, have imputed three severe, if not oppressive, measures to him. He raised the land-tax, laid a duty on cattle, and created a revenue from a monopoly of the sale of ice; a cheap and essential article of enjoyment in a country subject to such great vicissitudes of climate. a. d . 982. are informed by Persian historians, that the reigning caliph a. h. 372. .11 1 • His character, read the prayers at the funeral * of this good and great man, who is one of the few characters, amid the vast catalogue of oriental despots, on whose name we can dwell with pleasure. He long possessed the authority of a sovereign; and, during the latter period of his rule, all the honours due to a monarch were paid to him by cotemporary princes and by his own subjects. In the former, this conduct proceeded from respect to his character and power; in the latter, it was the result of gratitude and of affection ; and both were countenanced by the mandate of his nominal master, the Lord of the Faithful, who commanded that his virtuous and beloved vizier should be addressed and treated as a king. Except his first struggle with his weak and ambitious cousin 'I*, and the expulsion of one of his brothers J * There is a difference, of no less than twenty years, between the date of his death in the Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh and the History of the Arabians: but |his error exists throughout the history of the family of the Dilemee princes. The History of the Arabians is very incorrect: in it, Azud-u-doulah is termed the son of Muaz»u^douIah; and, from this, I am disposed to think, the author of that work has confounded him with his cousin, Izz-u-doulah. t Izz-u-doulah.

His name is still fondly cherished in a country, over which he endeavoured, through a reign of thirty-four years, to diffuse prosperity and joy. But in a dynasty of absolute rulers we seldom find a succession of virtuous and able men; and this prince was the last of his family that is entitled to our notice. His power and possessions became, from the moment of his death, a subject of contest between his brothers, sons*, and nephews. It would be a waste of time to dwell upon such a scene. After a lapse of thirty years, we find his nephew, Mujid-u-doulahf, (who had for a Mujid-u-dou- short time governed Khorassan, and assumed a regal state,) taken in lab ' Rhe, by the victorious Mahmood, of Ghizni. Mujid-u-doulah had been raised, by the death of his father, when very young, to the government of that city and the surrounding country. During the minority of this prince, all the power was in the hands of his mother, who was of high birth, and of great energy of character. Mahmood commanded one of his officers to inform this lady, that she must submit to his authority, or prepare for war. ' Had ' such a message been sent,' replied this heroine, ' in the life ' of my deceased lord, it must have occasioned great embar- ' rassment. That is not now the case.

He then advanced an army by the leader of which Mujid-u- the prince was deluded to an interview, and seized : his treasures and his^famUy dominions passed into the hands of Sultan Mahmood; who sent him, Z\otZi and his family, prisoners to Ghizni. From that period, the power of this dynasty was limited to the provinces of Fars and Kernaan; but they also exercised authority over Irak-Arab, or the territories immediately surrounding Bagdad, as they retained the high office of Ameer-ul-Omrahf till the capital of the caliphs was plundered by a. d. 1055.

The history of the first monarchs of Ghizni, whose rule was estab- chap. ix. lished for a short period over a great part of Persia, affords a more i An account of pleasing subject than that of the preceding dynasties; for that the mon archs absolute power which is, in Europe, softened by the usages and the knowledge of a civilized age into a moderate government, has, among the nations of Asia, always the same character, and nearly the same course. The few shades of distinction which do exist, depend chiefly upon the personal disposition and power of the despot; and often more upon the latter than on the former : for no country can be happy or prosperous which is exposed to continual war; and that appears, from the earliest period, to have been the state of every eastern kingdom, the sovereign of which was not powerful. It follows, that the greatest happiness which the mass of the population can obtain under such a government must have its source in the power and fame of the monarch, and the comparative blessings which his subjects enjoy form the substantial ground of their pride in such rulers. We must not, therefore, solely refer to base and venal motives, that flattery which they bestow on vol. i. 2 s314 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . ix. them. Insensible to the value of liberty, and ignorant of all other forms of government, they naturally prize that state of their own in which they find they have most security and enjoyment: and they are not only content, but proud to humble themselves before one exalted man, when they see, in the magnitude of his power, a certain refuge against more intolerable and oppressive evils. Abustakeen *, one of the chief nobles of Bokharahf, having renounced his allegiance to that court, retired, with his followers, to Ghizni, then an insignificant town, to escape the resentment of Munsoor, a prince of the House of Saman, whose elevation to the throne he had opposed, on the ground of his extreme youth}. It does not appear that the original followers of this chief amounted to more than seven or eight hundred: but he defeated, with these, a considerable force that was sent to attack him; and by that, and a. d. 976. other successes, established a petty principality, of which Ghizni jj Abustakeen is became the capital.

But the descent of such a man is of little consequence, except that his fame must rise in proportion to the lowness of his origin. He had been promoted and employed by the discernment of Abustakeen; and his character, as has been stated, obtained him the support of all the adherents and officers of that chief, who deemed his elevation to power alike essen tial to their security, and their advancement. Nor were they mis taken : the country of Ghizni attained, under his administration, the greatest prosperity. He enlarged its dominions, established the fame of its warriors, and became the first of a family which, though of short duration, outshone, at one period, the glory of the proudest dynasties of Asiatic monarchs. Subuctageens reign had nearly closed immediately after it commenced. He had aided a chief of the name of Tegha to recover a. d. on. the Town of Bust |j, from which he had been expelled.

Subuctageen took an opportunity, when they were hunting together, of expostulating with him upon his conduct: and Tegha. irritated Subuctageen by some expressions of that prince, suddenly assailed him, and gave wounded by him a severe wound before he had time to defend himself. Their followers, seeing their chiefs engaged, rushed to a conflict, which was maintained for some time with great fury, but terminated in the flight of Tegha, and his attendants, to Bust; which was immediately Takes the attacked by Subuctageen, and soon fell into his possession: but its governor effected his escape from the just indignation of the conqueror. The reputation which Subuctageen obtained by his conduct upon this occasion, was soon eclipsed by the glory that attended his holy wars (as they were termed) upon the infidels of India. To the attack of that country he was equally invited by the desire of fame, of plunder, and of fulfilling the mandates of the prophet, (in Defeats Jy- whom he believed,) by converting, or destroying, idolaters.

The heated br^ 8 ^ zeal of young Mahmood, the son of Subuctageen, spurned at these offers; and he vehemently urged his father to enter into no com pact with accursed idolaters; whom it was, he said, pious to destroy.

Subuctageen knew that there was truth in what * The author of the Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh gives the same fabulous account as the Indian historian, Ferishta, of the causes of the victory which Subuctageen gained upon this occasion. « There was,' he states, ' a clear well in the camp of the Indian monarch of such a quality, that the effects produced by any impure substance being ' cast into it were terrible. Subuctageen sent a secret emissary to throw dirt into ' this mysterious fountain. The moment his order was obeyed, the sky was overcast, « and a dreadful tempest arose. The coldness of the air was so excessive, that (to use ' the expression of the Mahomedan author) the tear was congealed in the eye, and the ' blood rendered stagnant in the veins. Both armies suffered; but the delicate Indians ' in a tenfold degree to the hardy warriors of Ghizni.' Fables of this description meet general belief, both from Hindoos and Mahomedans.

Aware of what he had to expect after such conduct, he assembled troops from every quarter of his extensive dominions; which appear, from the list of chiefs that joined him, to have included all the countries from the Indus to the province of Malwa in one direction, and to Bengal in another*. But this vast Subuctageen army, which, we are told, exceeded three hundred thousand men, defeats him, was attacked and defeated by Subuctageen, whose force did not described. When with the army of Nizam-u-doulah, in the year 1790, I witnessed a scene of this kind. The Hindoo Rajah of Deudroog (a hill fort in the Deckan) was at war with the Rajah of Solapore. The Nizam, to whom they were both tributaries, aided the latter; and the French corps under Raymond, in that prince's service, were detached a few miles from our camp to take Deudroog. After making a breach, they stormed; and we heard a heavy fire of cannon and musquetry throughout the greatest part of the night, which terminated in an explosion. We were informed, next morning, that the gallant rajah, after defending the breach to the last, and being severely wounded, retired, with a few surviving adherents, to a fortified palace, where he had lodged all his women and children. This he had undermined, that he might, if driven to despair, avoid a disgrace, which he deemed far more terrible than death. The hour was arrived:—he ordered the train to be fired :—and the dreadful explosion which took place, left not a limb of the family of the Rajah of Deadroog for his enemies to triumph over! Dow, in his History of India, has recorded many similar instances : but the afiecting relation which Orfne has given of the massacre at Boobilee, when that place was assailed by the French under the justly celebrated Bussy, is the most authentic and characteristic example of the action of this brave, though savage, spirit of resistance. * Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 319 amount to one fifth of their numbers.

In his conduct to his captive brother, Mahmood considered more what was due to himself, than what his prisoner merited; and Ismail, though deprived of liberty, was, through life, treated with humanity and indulgence.

Cawder, sensible of the importance of such a friend and supporter as Mahmood, praised his pious zeal, and encouraged him to obtain a never-dying name in this world, and eternal happiness in the next, by spreading the religion of Mahomed. This eastern pope granted, to the earnest solicitation of the temporal sovereign, the titles of ' the right hand/' and ' the protector of the ' faith/' The prince promised, in return, that his sword should, through life, be sacred to the service of the religion he loved: and it would be difficult to compute the millions whom he forced, by that powerful instrument of conversion, to adopt its tenets. After securing the friendship of the caliph, settling the governments of Khorassan and Rhe, and connecting himself, by the most intimate ties, with the ruler of Tartary, Ilij Khan, whose daughter he married, Mahmood commenced that religious war upon the idolaters of India, which occupied the greatest period of his reign. In his two first expeditions to India he was completely success ful ; and not only defeated his enemies, but established his govern ment over almost the whole of that country now known as the Punjaub. Jypaul, who had opposed Subuctageen, took the field to try his fortune against the son of that ruler: but his army was defeated: and the superstitious but patriotic prince determined, by an heroic sacrifice of his own life, to endeavour to propitiate the gods, whom he adored, to save his country from that ruin with which Imam.

These were at first thrown into disorder by the violence of the charge; but Mahmood, alighting from his horse, and mounting an elephant, from whence he could be seen by his whole army, encouraged his troops, by his speeches and actions, to follow him to victory, or to death. The elephant on which he rode appeared, we are informed, animated with the spirit of his master: he spread terror and confusion amid the ranks of Ilij Khan, and with one blow of his trunk struck the standard-bearer* of that chief to the ground.

That monarch, who had pursued the Tartars across the Oxus, was re luctantly forced to retreat by the severity of the winter: but he did not yield to the elements till he had lost a number of his soldiers; and, impatient of inaction, he proceeded, the instant he returned from Tartary, to Paishawur, to punish a Hindoo prince*, who had embraced Mahomedanism, and had been raised to power as the reward of his religious profession; but who, taking advantage of Mah^ mood's absence, had recanted, and thrown off his allegiance.

His enemies at length resolved to attack him in that position. The trench was carried by the fury of the first assailants, and great numbers of the Mahomedans were slain: but victory, which * The name of this prince was Zabsais. t It is said to have exceeded three hundred thousand men.326 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . ix. long wavered, at length decided for Mahmood; who, however, is stated to have chiefly owed this important success to the accident of Defeats them. the elephant of Anundpal taking fright*, and flying with that rajah; an event that spread dismay and confusion amid his troops, who instantly abandoned the field.

The distance was great, and the obstacles to success numerous, as a. d.1018. a. h. 409. the march itself was computed to occupy a period of three months. Mahmood selected, for this enterprise, one hundred thousand horse, and thirty thousand foot, of the best soldiers of his army; and com mencing his march by the route of Cashmere, continued it, after he had passed that province, through the mountains, probably to avoid the broad and deep streams of the Punjaub. After he descended into the plains of Hindostan, he advanced rapidly upon Cannouge: and so remarkable was the celerity of this movement, that the ruler of that city, whose name was Korrah, was completely surprised, and, being which he unable to oppose the invaders, threw himself upon the generous takes. clemency of Mahmood, who took possession of the city, but only Also Meerut, remained in it three days.

But a grand mosque, which Mahmood erected, surpassed every other edifice. The beauty of the marble of which it was built, and the superior style of the architecture, were not more admirable than the richness of the carpets and golden branch-lights with which it was ornamented: and the vanity of the monarch was flattered by hearing this favourite edifice called by the lofty, if not impious, title ofThe Celestial Bride.' , He sent an account of his victories, written in verse, to the Caliph of Bagdad, with a variety of valuable and curious presents; and the Commander of the Faithful did not disdain to bear incense to the hero of that religion of which he was the spiritual head. The poetic eulogy on Mahmood was ordered to be publicly read at the capital of the caliph: and every means were used that could stimulate the pride and bigotry of the conqueror to further exertions in the cause of that faith of which he was the avowed champion. But the character of Mah mood required no such encouragement: he was sufficiently prone to enterprise; and that time which appeared given to enjoyment, was probably only spent in preparation for fresh labours.

Mahomedan historians describe his Kalin j ur - having raised the siege of both to the rich ransom offered in the shape of presents by their governors: and Nunda, the rajah of the latter, is stated to have gained greatly on the favour of Mahmood, by sending him a poem which he had written in praise of his great qualities. But this flattery, which might have been acceptable, as it afforded a pretext for retreat from a hopeless enterprise, would have had little effect on the monarch of Ghizni, if he had seen a prospect of making himself master of forts which would have completed the subjection of the countries he had so often invaded. It is not probable that he possessed any means of reducing these mountain fortifications, which, from their natural strength, have of late years confidently braved the improved science and disciplined valour of a British army*.

'I' The Persian historians who have recorded this celebrated expedition of Mah- mood, are correct in all the leading facts: but these are seldom either very minute or accurate in their geographical descriptions, or on points connected with Hindoo mytho logy. I have received the following curious account of the position and history of the Temple of Somnauth from a friend; whose learning and local knowledge give com plete authenticity to his communications upon this subject. This temple stood in the country of Soreth, a province of the peninsula of Guzerat, which is now more generally known under the name of Kattywar; and which is cele brated in the Poorans for containing five inestimable blessings. First, the River GOomptee: second, beautiful women : third, good horses : fourth, Somnauth : and fifth, Dawarka. Among the many places in Soreth that are held sacred by the Hindoos, Somnauth, or Somnauth Putten, as it is more generally termed, has always been one of the most remarkable. It stands one or two miles from the sea, at the junction of three rivers, the Hurna, Kupula, and Sersutty, at a distance of three miles to the east of the port of Belawul, which is laid down, in the most accurate charts of the Guzerat .coast, in North latitude 21° 58', and East longitude 70° Si'. Somnauth is one of the twelve symbols of Mahadeo, which are said to have descended from heaven to the earth. The great fame of this temple throughout theTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 335 was immense; but the glory which Mahmood claimed, was the chap, ix, destruction of the celebrated idol, which is represented as a gigantic image*, fifteen feet in height. The king, after giving it a blow with the Somnauth. East, attracted, as has been noticed, the bigotry and cupidity of Sultan Mahmood, of Ghizni. The holy image was, according to Mahomedan authors, destroyed : but this fact is denied by Hindoos, who assert that the god retired into the ocean. The temple, though despoiled of its enormous treasures, soon recovered both fame and wealth suffi cient to make it an object of attack to many Mahomedan princes : and Sultan Mah mood Begharah, who obtained possession of the throne of Amedabad in the year of the Hejirah 877, marched against Somnauth, razed the temple to the ground, and, with the bigoted zeal of a Mahomedan conqueror, built a mosque upon the spot where it stood. The province of Soreth has, ever since that period, remained under a Mahomedan government; but the persevering piety of the Hindoos has overcome the bigotiy of their rulers. The mosque has fallen into ruin; and Ahsela Bhaee, the widow of a prince of the Mahratta family of Holkar, has lately erected a new temple on the exact site of that which was demolished. A symbol of Mahadeo has been placed in this temple, which is deemed peculiarly propitious to those who desire offspring: and Som nauth, though it has lost its former splendour, still retains its reputation, and is visited by pilgrims from every quarter, who pay a trifling duty to the Mahomedan ruler, for the liberty they enjoy of paying their devotions at this favourite shrine. Not only the spot upon which the Temple of Somnauth stands, but its vicinity is- celebrated in the tales of Hindoo mythology. It was on the plains near it on which the most celebrated battle of the Jadoos was fought. We are informed, that in this action, which took place about five thousand years ago, there were six crore, or sixty millions of combatants, and that all were slain. About a mile from Somnauth, at a place called Bhalka, the Hindoo pilgrim is shown a solitary Peepul tree, on the banks of the Sersutty River, which he is assured stands on the exact spot where the god, Shree Krishen, received the mortal wound from an arrow, that terminated his incarnation. * I have followed Dew's Translation of FerUhta in the deseriptien of this idol.

At this moment, a number of brahmins came forward, and offered several millions of money if he would spare their idol. His nobles entreated Mahmood to accept of the ransom: but that prince, exclaiming that he desired the title of a breaker, not a seller, of idols, commanded them to destroy it. A few more blows discovered an immense quantity of rich jewels that had been concealed in the hollow parts of this image; and proved, that the priests of the temple had been actuated by other than pious motives; for the treasures concealed were found to be of much greater value than the sum they had offered for the ransom of their idol.

TheTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. The army suffered much more in crossing the deserts in their return than on their advance. It appears that they went by a dif ferent route, as they were led astray three marches in a desert near the Indus by a guide who pretended to a perfect knowledge of the road; but who confessed, when about to suffer death for the deception he had practised, that he was a priest of the idol Somnauth, and had sought to revenge that god by leading the troops of Ghizni to destruction. Mahmood, after this expedition, engaged in a war with a people in the neighbourhood of Mooltan, called Jats* whose fleets he conqueror, they inform us, preferred raising to power a recluse, descended from the ancient family of Dabissalima, who had long governed that country, to bestowing it on a neighbouring prince of the same race. And, on the person he had elevated expressing apprehensions of his powerful relation, Mahmood marched against him, and made him prisoner. The new ruler could not violate the usages of his country, by putting the prince he so much feared to death: he requested, therefore, that he might be carried to Ghizni, and sent back when there was less danger from his being kept prisoner at Guzerat. Mahmood complied with all his wishes: and some years afterwards the captive was sent to his native country. The ruling prince had prepared a dungeon under his throne, where he meant to imprison his relative; whom he went to meet, that he might, when he received him from the guards of Mahmood, by whom he was con veyed to the frontier, enjoy the triumph of making him run by his horse like a slave. The day after his prisoner was in his power, he was fatigued, and lay down on the ground to take some repose. Having spread a red handkerchief over his face to cover him from the rays of the sun, it was mistaken for a piece of meat by a vulture, who pounced upon it, and struck out one of the eyes of the prince. The usages of the country forbade any person being ruler with such a defect. The moment it was per ceived, the lot of the prince and his captive changed; and the recluse, whom Mahmood had elevated to the throne, had to walk along side of the horse of his late prisoner, and was doomed to inhabit the dungeon he had built.— F erishta. * The Jats are a tribe of Hindoos, many of whom are settled in Hindostan.

At the commencement of the next year, Mahmood died of a com plaint* with which he had been long afflicted. His life terminated in a magnificent edifice, which he had vainly called ' The Palace of ' Felicity:' and immediately before he expired, he took a last and mournful view of his army, his court, and the enormous treasures which he had accumulated by his unparalleled successes. He is said to have contemplated them with a sigh, which might have proceeded either from a sense of the vanity of all earthly glory, or from a reluctance to abandon the enjoyment of his vast wealth and power.

His desire of conquest was rendered more ter- rible to those whom he attacked, by his cruel bigotry ; for in every country that he subdued, the horrors of war were increased by those of religious persecution : and we have no other evidence of his good government, than the general tranquillity of his own dominions; an effect which was the consequence of his great success in foreign wars, and which might have equally proceeded from a dread of his severity, as from a confidence in his justice. The popular tale, which represents his vizier as pretending to a knowledge of the language of birds, and explaining the liberality of an old owl, who, after wishing ' Mah- ' mood a long life,' offered a hundred ruined villages as a dowry to her daughter, presents, in a truly eastern form, the picture of a reign more marked by desolation than improvement. History has recorded one memorable proof of his resolute justice. A poor man had complained that a young noble of the court came constantly to instance of his his house at night, turned him out of doors, and slept with his wife. JUStlCe ' The monarch bade him give him notice the next time this occurred. He did as he was directed; and Mahmood went with him to his house. When he reached it, he put out a lamp that was burn ing, and having found the paramour, struck off his head with one blow of his cimeter. He then called for a light; and after viewing the corpse, fell upon his knees and returned thanks to Heaven : after which, he bade the astonished husband bring him water, and drank an immoderate quantity. ' You are surprised at ' my actions/' said Mahmood: ' but know, that since you informed ' me of the outrage you suffered, I have neither slept, eat, nor drank. ' I conceived that no person, except one of my sons, would dare340 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . ix. ' openly to commit so great a crime: resolved to do justice, I extin- « guished the light, that my feelings as a father might not prevent ' me from doing my duty as a sovereign: my prayers were a thanks- ' giving to the Almighty, when I saw that I had not been compelled ' to slay one of my own offspring: and I drank, as you observed, ' like a man that was expiring from thirst*.' This monarch has been accused of avarice: but there appears no just grounds for this accusation. His army was distinguished for its attachment to his person: and that sentiment could only have been produced in such a body of men by liberal treatment. His court was splendid beyond example. The edifices he erected were grand : and he gave to learned men and to poets the most libe ral encouragement. It is to his love of literature that we owe almost all that remains of the history of ancient Persia contained in the noble epic poem of the Shah Namah, (or Book of Kings); a work which must endure as long as the language in which it is written. Unfor tunately for the fame of Mahmood, as a munificent patron of splendid genius, he was persuaded, by envious rivals, to diminish the reward that he had promised Ferdosi. The bard spurned the present which he sent him, and added to his poem a bitter satire upon the king's want of generosity: but, after he had given vent to his feelings, he thought it prudent to leave the court, and to retire to his native City of Toosf, in Khorassan. Some time elapsed before Mahmood saw the verses he had written ; and sensible, too late, of his error, he tried to retrieve his fame, by sending an immense sum to the poet: but the # This anecdote of Mahmood is, I believe, related by every historian who has written his life. t The modern Mushed.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 341 rich present reached the gates of Toos as the body of Ferdosi was chap. ix. carrying to its last mansion, and it was rejected by his virtuous daughter, who scorned to accept that wealth which had been once denied to the unrivalled merit of her illustrious father*. The territories of Subuctageen were large: but they were extended Extent of his by his son to a magnitude that placed the monarch of Ghizni on a level, in point of power, with Shahpoor and Nousheerwan. The limits of this vast kingdom, at the death of Mahmood, were the pro vinces of Georgia and Bagdad, to the west and south-west; the king dom of Bokharah and Kashgur, to the north and north-east; and the provinces of Bengal and the Deckan, as far as the Indian Ocean, to the east and south-east. But the rise of this great dynasty was not more rapid than its downfal, which we may date from the death of that monarch to whom it owes all its lustre in the page of history-f*. The successors of Mahmood merit but a short notice. His foresight had anticipated a contest between his sons: and his fears were con firmed by the answer that he received from the elder, named Mas- soud, when he asked him how he meant to conduct himself towards his brother Mahomed : ' As you did towards your brother Ismail/' was the reproachful reply: and the youth was true to his word; for His son, Mas- the moment he heard of his father's death, he commenced his march toGhknT' 63 to Ghizni.

He only desired to hold, in independent sovereignty, the countries of Irak, Rhe, and Aderbijan, and to have his name, as elder brother, (for though they were twins, Massoud was first born,) read before his brother's in public prayers. But Mahomed refused all overtures, in the vain confidence which the actual possession of his father's treasures and throne inspired. He was, however, deserted^ by all his troops, and fell, after a short reign of five months, into the hands of his brother, who deprived him of sight, and placed him in close confinement. The first enterprise of Massoud was the conquest of Cutch and Mekran. He made several incursions into India, to maintain the tranquillity of those possessions which his father had subdued. The forts of Sersutty and Hassif are the only conquests ascribed to him. But he had no time to attack others : all his means were required to defend himself from a formi dable tribe of Tartars, called Seljookee, who had, for a considerable time past, made predatory incursions into Khorassan, and other parts of his dominions, and threatened to overthrow his government. Massoud's first effort was to negotiate a peace with this tribe. He had an interview with their leader, Dawood, at Bulkh, and entered into a compact, by which he agreed to give these dangerous neighbours some pasture grounds for their flocks within his terri tories : but their faithless conduct soon convinced him of the ineffi- cacy of this arrangement, and that he could only obtain security * The first body of men that deserted him were what Dow calls the slaves; but he has translated the words Gholam Shah erroneously.

They were overthrown by a family which had long submitted to their power, but whose uncertain allegiance was the source of constant uneasiness; for the princes of Ghour, who derived their proud descent from Zohauk*, and who boasted that their ancestors had successfully opposed Feridoon, could but ill brook that dependence to which they were reduced by the first rulers of Ghizni. The situation of their country, (which lies to the northward of Ghizni,) amid rugged and barren mountains, was favourable to insurrection: and their power increased as that of the descendants of Subuctageen declined: till they at last rose upon their ruin, not only to the throne • of Ghizni, but to that of India.

T hough a great part of Persia had been subject to the princes of Samanee and of Ghizni, (both families of Turkish descent,) that Observations m on the Tartar country had never been completely subdued by the tribes ot iar- tary* : but, in the weak and distracted state into which it had fallen, it could not long remain exempt from a fate to which more than half the world had been exposed. For, whether we direct our view to the fertile plains of China, the rich provinces of India, the rugged mountains of northern Europe, or to the beautiful valleys of Asia Minor, we find all, in their turns, have been invaded by warlike tribes; who, issuing from the vast and varied countries of Tartary, have plundered and subdued the fairest regions of the earth. Great * This observation more particularly applies to that portion of Persian history which is subsequent to the Mahomedan conquest. We read in Herodotus, that the Scythians conquered Persia, and maintained the government of that country for some time: and the Parthian monarchs are said, by Greek authors, to have been of Scythian descent. Ferdosi admits that the tribes of Turan had a partial possession of Persia for twelve years: but we have no authentic record, which can lead us to pronounce that the whole of that kingdom was ever, before this period, completely subdued by the tribes of Tartary.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 349 and powerful causes alone could have produced so extraordinary an chap. x. effect. These are to be found in the personal character, the condi- ■ iii- i nim -n Their habits, tion, the habits, and manners or the lartars. Every male of this character, and great country is a soldier: every female is educated to attend, and to condmon • aid a husband, whose dwelling is a slight tent made of coarse wool; whose food is his flocks, or the chase; whose occupation is war; and who, even in peace, changes his habitation every season. The man is robust, hardy, and brave: the woman is a stranger to all those luxuries that nourish effeminacy : and their children, at an age when those of other countries are treated as infants, ride, and manage the most unruly horses. Such is the race of human beings, who, divided into large families, or tribes, roam over Tartary. Each tribe obeys a hereditary chief; who exercises more of a patriarchal than an absolute sway ; and who is at once supported and checked by the authority of the reish suffeeds*, or elders, who preside over the different branches of the tribe. The number of the particular tribes is often greatly increased by the admission of captives, or the reduction of an other tribe to be their subjects, or rather adherents: but they are still more frequently diminished by internal divisions: and when a discontented son, or nephew, of a chief, or an elder, separates with a branch, they generally adopt his name, and become a distinct tribe, though still considering themselves as a branch from the original stock. This is one, among many causes, which gives new names every day to these tribes, and throws a confusion into * The literal meaning of this word is 'grey-beard:' and this authority was, no doubt, meant only to be given to elders; but it is often hereditary, and consequently sometimes falls to young men.350 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . x. their genealogy, which it is impossible to unravel^. The condition of the Tartars is a state of constant war, either against the beasts of the field, or man; but generally the latter. Their country is either distracted by petty factions, or united under some great leader, who conducts them forth to plunder and conquest, in distant lands. They may be said to esteem no qualities, but valour in man, and chastity in woman. There appears to the Tartars only one path to eminence,—that of military renown. To it the whole nation crowd; and, though attached to their hereditary chief, and envious of other tribes, they readily join the standard of any great leader, whom they consider as distinguished by his superior courage and conduct. His success makes him their king; while his failure reduces him to be their equal. As the hordes f that proceed upon foreign expeditions quit their usual places of residence, or rather encampment, these are instantly occupied by other tribes; who are, perhaps, ranging in search of better pasture lands, or driven by powerful neighbours from those which they possessed: and thus the body in advance has no retreat, nor do they desire one: wherever they pitch, their rude tents are their habitations; and all their wealth, which consists in horses, camels, and sheep, accompany their march. They are, in fact, a moving nation of soldiers, whose hostile attack is never * The astonishing labour and learning of the elder De Guignes has afforded us, in his History of the Huns and Tartars, great information upon this subject.

They seldom invade great empires but when on the decline; and that has, no doubt, been one of the chief causes of their success. A population, however numerous, rendered effeminate by prosperity, and a great proportion of which is devoted to peaceable occupa tions, cannot cope with such a band. The army of the state has, at once, to defend the country from devastation, and to meet a daring enemy in the field : a defeat is fatal, and a victory not decisive; for the invaders have neither wealth nor country to lose. They have not even a place to fly to; and can hardly be conquered without being extirpated. The fame of these Tartar tribes was so great, that the very rumour of their intended invasion threw a government into con fusion: and when we consider their means^of war, we can scarcely be surprised at so many monarchs having purchased an exemption from immediate danger; and, at the moment, added to their personal power,'by having recourse to the delusive, though dangerous, expedient of granting lands for the flocks, and accepting the military service of these formidable enemies. In every case in which this has been adopted, the result has been the same. The report of the fruitful and delightful pasture grounds which the policy or valour of their coun trymen had acquired, has flown to Tartary; and the arrival of fresh tribes to their support, has at once stimulated and enabled them to complete the conquest they originally intended. But they have sel dom possessed, for any long period, the countries they have subdued. To men accustomed to coarse fare, and a life of incessant fatigue, scenes of indulgence and repose seem a Paradise; and when they352 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . x. attain it, their joy is intemperate. The consequence is natural: they, in their turn, fall the victims of that wealth and luxury which excited their enterprise, and promoted their success. An account of The Tartar tribe of Seljookee derive their name from Seljook, Seijookee. 0f a chief of great reputation, who had been compelled to quit the Court of Bighoo Khan, the sovereign of the Turks of Kapchack* Seljook, who had proceeded with his tribe to the plains of Bokharah, died at a very advanced age. His son Michail became known to Sultan Mahmood, of Ghizni, and was greatly honoured by that monarch; who, according to several writers, persuaded him to cross the Oxus, and settle in Khorassan. But this fact rests upon doubt ful evidence. The numbers of this tribe, and their adherents, appear, from the same authors f, to have been very great. They relate, that on Mahmood asking the ambassador of their chief what force they could bring to his aid ; ' Send this arrow,' said the envoy, presenting one of two which he held in his hand, ' and fifty thou- « sand horse will appear!'—' Is that all?' exclaimed Mahmood. ' Send this,' said he, presenting the other, ' and an equal number ' will follow.'—' But suppose I was in extreme distress,' ob served the monarch, ' and wanted your utmost exertions?'— ' Then,' replied the ambassador, ' send my bow, and two hundred ' thousand horse will obey the summons! The proud conqueror heard, with secret alarm, this terrifying account of their numbers: * Khondemir states, that Bighoo Khan was chief of the Turkish tribes which dwelt on the plain of Khezer, i. e.

The celebrated bourda, or black mantle of the Abbasides, was thrown over his shoulder; and his right hand held the staff of Mahomed. Toghrul kissed the ground ; and, after standing for a short time in a respectful posture, was led to the caliph; near whom he was placed, on another throne. His commis- Is appointed a sion was then read; which appointed him the lieutenant, or vice- IhTcaiiph. 0f gerent, of the vicar of the holy prophet, and the lord of all Mahomedans. He was invested with seven dresses, and had seven slaves bestowed upon him : a ceremony which implied, that he was appointed to the rule of the seven regions subject to the Commander of the Faithful. A veil of gold stuff, scented with musk, was thrown over his head, on which two crowns were placed; one for Arabia, and the other for Persia: while two swords were girt on his loins, to signify, that he was ruler both of the East and of the West. This vain display satisfied the pride of the caliph: and the Turkish chief was pleased to receive a confirmation of past, and a sanction for future conquest, from the spiritual head of his faith; who was still deemed, by orthodox Mahomedans, to be the only source of legitimate authority. Toghrul was successful in several actions, which he fought with the armies of the declining empire of Constantinople, which opposed invades Geor- him when he invaded the provinces of Georgia and Iberia*.

His sister had already married Ul-Kaim; and chap. x. the monarch desired to strengthen the connexion, and to add to his own glory, by espousing the daughter of the Commander of the Faithful. We are told, that the pride of the House of Abbas was a.d. iocs, shocked at this proposition, and that some hesitation was shown: but A ' II ' 454 ' Toghrul had not learnt to bear disappointment; and the relief he gave to the distress of the caliph, who had been imprisoned by his rebellious servants, reminded that proud pontiff of his dependent condition. The princess was sent, and the nuptials were celebrated ills marriage with the greatest splendour. But the royal bridegroom, who had daughter 6 of arrived at the advanced age of seventy, only enjoyed the happiness thecall^)h, he had so anxiously sought for a few months. He died of an illness His death, he caught at the mountain fortress of Rood bar* ; where he had gone to pass the summer, that he might avoid the heats and unwholesome a. d . ices, air of the City of Rhe.

He was violent in his temper, and insatiable of conquest : but he was distinguished by courage, frankness, and generosity. His family and tribe had, as has been before mentioned, embraced the Mahomedan doctrine. This conversion may be dated from the first settlement of Seljook near Bokharah ; to which province the Arabs had, some centuries before, spread their creed and their dominion. Toghrul, who was hailed by the caliph, in his first victories in Persia, with the title of Rukun-u-deen, or ' the pillar ' of the faith/' appears to have been a zealous promoter of the religion he professed. He erected a great number of mosques throughout his * Roodbar lies about fifty miles to the northward of the City of Kazveen.356 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . x. dominions, and gave distinction to pious and learned men. It was to this disposition in Toghrul, and his immediate successors, that the caliphs of Bagdad owed that comparative ease and dignity, to what they had enjoyed under the princes of the family of Dilemee; who had latterly ceased to treat them with even those marks of external respect to which, in their character of spiritual princes alone, they appeared entitled. a. d. 1063.

He united valour and generosity with the love of learning and of the sciences: and if we could regard him in the same light in which he is considered by Mahomedan authors, (who deem his cruel and bigoted persecution of the Christians in Armenia, Georgia, and Iberia, the most praiseworthy of all his actions,) we should term this monarch one of the best, as he certainly is one of the most His invasion renowned, of the sovereigns of Asia.

Romanus desired to a. d. 1070 improve this success, and advanced into Armenia and Aderbijan ; A ' 463 ' but he was met near the village of Konongo, in the latter province, by Alp-Arselan, who, though confident in his own courage and that of his army, shuddered (as his panegyrists * state,) at the thought of shedding the blood of true believers, and offered liberal terms of offers terms accommodation to the Roman emperor: but that prince, they add, llpe^. 0111 ' imputed his moderation to a wrong cause, and replied with insolence; That he would hearken to no terms, except the Persian king would ' abandon his place of encampment to the Roman army, and sur render his capital, the City of Rhe, as a pledge of the sincerity ' of his desire for peace.' When Alp-Arselan received this answer, he immediately prepared for action. The numbers of the armies were unequal; that of Romanus was the most numerous. But we can grant no credit to those partial historians who assert, that the Greeks had three hundred thousand f men, while Alp-Arselan * De Guignes.

The more probable account of De Guignes states, that Alp- Arselan had forty thousand men; and though the army of Romanus, at the opening of the season, consisted of more than one hundred thousand, it had been much reduced and was imprudently separated in distant operations : and the force with the emperor does not appear to have been very superior in numbers to that of Alp-Arselan, as it was weakened, immediately before the action, by the desertion of a body of the Turkoman tribe of Guz, or Uzzie, as the Roman writers call them.358 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . x. had only twelve thousand!! It was as impossible that the Roman empire could, at this period, have sent so vast a force to a war on its frontier, as that the monarch of Persia should have trusted his life and fortune on the success of a battle fought by so small a division of his great army. 'We are informed by respectable authors, that he had forty thousand men; and it is probable that the force of his enemies did not much exceed that number*. Rom an us was confident of victory.

The exchange of his bow and arrows for a cimeter and mace, declared the manner in which he was resolved to fight; while his conduct, his dress, and his speeches, proclaimed to every soldier in his army, that if he could not preserve his earthly kingdom by a victory over those he deemed infidels, he was resolved to obtain the glorious crown of martyrdom. The troops of Romanus commenced the action, and were at first successful: but the ardent valour of their emperor led him to advance too far; and when he desired to retreat to his encampment, a confusion was produced in his ranks by the cowardice or treachery of one of his principal leaders, who withdrew a large division from his support. The * Several western authors state, that the advantage of numbers was on the side of |the Persians. f The horges in Persia have long tails: but it is the custom of the country to tie them up, which not only improves the animal's appearance, but prevents their tails trailing on the ground, or being whisked about, when wet Or dirty, to the annoyaijce of the rider. % I&gt;e Guignes,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 359 experience of Alp-Arselan took advantage of the crisis: and a chap . x. general charge of his whole army completed the defeat of his enemies. All that personal courage could effect, was done by Romanus, to repair the disorder of his troops: and he fought to the last with a courage that gained strength from despair: but, overwhelmed by numbers, wounded, and thrown upon the ground, he was seized, and carried to Alp-Ar S elan, by an obscure Ron.,™, officer whom that monarch had the morning before, at a general ake, ' pri!0 ' et review of his army, threatened to disgrace, on account of his mean and deformed personal appearance*. The King of Persia could hardly believe his good fortune: but having ascertained, from the evidence of his former ambassadors, and from the tears of captive Romans, who wept on seeing their unfortunate emperor, that he really possessed the person of Romanus, he treated hi S royal prisoner with the extreme of kindness and of distinction : he uttered no reproaches that could wound the feelings of a humbled monarch, but gave vent to the honest indignation of a warrior at the base and cowardly conduct of those who had deserted and abandoned so brave a leader. Alp-Arselan, we are informed, demanded of his captive, at their first conference, what he would have done if fortune had reversed their lot. ' I would have given thee many a stripe*,' was the im prudent and virulent answer. The proud rage of an insolent and unsubdued spint could excite no anger in the breast of the brave and generous monarch to whom it was addressed. The sultan only smiled, and asked Romanus what he expected would be done to * Kholasant-ul-Akhbar and Abulfiradge. f De Guignes, Vol. III. page 210.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . x. him. 44 If thou art cruel,' said the emperor, 44 put me to death. If ' vain-glorious, load me with chains, and drag me in triumph to thy ' capital. If generous, grant me my liberty*. Alp-Arselan was neither cruel nor yain-glorious: he nobly released his prisoner, and gave all his officers who were captives, dresses of honour, and distinguished them by every mark of his friendship and regard. Romanus, in order to requite these favours, agreed to pay a large ransom^, and to remit annually a fixed tribute. But he could never recover his throne, which had been usurped during his absence. He showed, however, his attention to his faith, by sending all the money he could raise, to fulfil, as far as he had the power, the obligations into which he had entered. Alp-Arselan, pleased with the conduct of his former enemy, was preparing to effect Romanus « his restoration by arms, when he learnt that the unfortunate Chis'own Romanus Diogenes had been imprisoned and put to death by subjects. ,i • i. his own subjects.

His power, at this period, extended from the deserts of Arabia to the Oxus. He was enriched by the spoils of the Roman empire: and his army consisted of two hundred thousand soldiers. He had, immediately after he defeated the Romans, sub dued the greater part of Khaurizm. He now commanded that a bridge should be thrown over the Oxus, which he passed without Aip-Arseian opposition. But here his proud career was destined to close. His oTs!

The bold spirit of Conduct of its Yusuph was provoked to a violent reply; and, on hearing an order commander - for his being put to death in a cruel manner, he drew his dagger, and flew at the Persian monarch. The guards rushed in : but Alp-Arselan, who deemed himself unequalled in skill as an archer, seized his bow, and ordered them to keep alooff.

The life of this monarch was passed in the army; and the civil government of his country appears to have been wholly committed to a minister, whose name is the favourite theme of every eastern historian. Nizam-ul-Mulk * shared the glory of his sovereign : but the character of Alp-Arselan is elevated by that of his minister; for we must equally admire the discernment that discovered such rare abilities and virtue, and that noble and unsuspecting con fidence, which gave them so unbounded a sphere of action. Under the direction of Nizam-ul-Mulk, the territories of Alp-Arselan at tained the highest state of prosperity. Justice was well adminis tered; colleges and mosques were erected in every city; learning was encouraged; the poor were protected; and the inhabitants of Persia confessed, that the conquest of their country by the savage Tartars, which they had dreaded as the worst of evils, had proved the greatest of blessings. This minister, however, had no talents as a general: and, in the few military operations in which he was engaged, he seems to have trusted more to his piety than to his valour. We find him, when foiled in his attempt to make himself master of a castle-j- in Fars, consoling himself by a philosopical reflection, which taught, ' That a man should not * He is only known by his title, which means ' the ornamenter of the state,' (or person who gives order to the country.) f The rebel governor of this castle was a general of Alp-Arselan, who had received this government in reward for his having defeated Kara Arselan, one of the Seljook princes of Kerman.364 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . x.

But the warrior monarch did not require the aid of the philosopher's sword; it was to dispense the blessings of good government, not to make war, that he employed him; and his expectations were fully answered. Their names have descended together to posterity; and if there are few instances in history of a monarch's bestowing such boundless trust, there are, perhaps, still fewer of confidence so well rewarded. His right dis- The right J of Malik Shah to the crown of his father was disputed Kv Po,.,- or L der Beg. by his uncle, Cawder Beg, Prince of Kerman: but that chief was defeated and taken prisoner. He was confined in a strong fortress in Khorassan H; and his life, we are told, would have been preserved, had not the troops of that province mutinied for an increase of pay, and threatened that, if it were not granted, they would raise Cawder Beg to the throne. Nizam-ul-Mulk pretended, in order to gain time, that he would forward their petition: but, anxious to prevent civil war, he sent secret orders to despatch # D'Herbelot. f D'Herbelot. J Before Alp-Arselan proceeded on his last expedition, he assembled all the governors of provinces and chiefs of his array at Mushed : and, having seated ihe Prince Malik upon a splendid throne, he commanded that all should offer him their allegiance, as the successor to his crown. 11 De Guignes, Vol. III. page 214. puted by Caw-THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 365 the royal captive: and his death defeated all the projects of the chap, x. mutineers, as it deprived them of a head to their combination. The Who is put to active valour of Malik Shah defeated another rebellion, headed by death - one of his brothers, called Tourtousch, who was compelled to save himself by leaving the kingdom. The Caliph Ul-Kaim* died soon after Malik Shah ascended the throne; and, as that monarch was the real master of the empire, the nomination of a successor was deferred till he was consulted. He deputed a son of Nizam-ul-Mulk to Bagdad, with orders to raise Mochtadi to the nominal rank of Commander of the Faithful. The generals of Malik Shah subdued almost the whole of Syria Malik simh and Egypt: and that prince, more fortunate than his father, not only conquests^ a conquered Bokharah-f-, Samarcund, and Khaurizm, but received a. * The title of sultan was given by Ul-Kaim to Malik Shah, and that of Ameer-ul- Moumenan, or ' lord of the faithful/' which before had been confined to the caliphs themselves, was bestowed on this prince, who also was termed Jellal-u-Doula-ul-Deen, or, ' the glory of the state and of religion.' The use of this description of titles first appears to have become common in the time of the dynasty of Dilem, all of which were distinguished by some high names from the caliphs. The usage has spread throughout every Mahomedan government: and we find in general those have highest titles who have least power. The vain love of this shadow of grandeur has remained, where all its substance has fled. The royal family of Delhi, now pensioners of the British government, continue to grant names, as if in the zenith of their power. Many of the gentlemen of the civil establishment of Bengal are ' dragons of war' and ' lions of battle,' while several military officers are ' the pillars of the state,' ' ornamenters of dominion,' &amp;c. If this fallen and pensioned court receive its fees, it is indifferent as to the titles given : and the Subah of the Deckan issues from his palace at Hyderabad titles equally magnificent as those conferred by the nominal sovereign of Delhi, whose slave he styles himself. t Abulfedha.

It is related , that when Malik Shah was passing the Oxus, the boatmen who were employed on that river complained to him that they were paid by an order on the revenues of Antioch. The sultan spoke to his minister. It is ' not to defer the payment of their wages/' said Nizam-ul-Mulk, ' that I have granted them this order, but to manifest your glory, ' and the wide extent of your dominions/ , The sultan was pleased with this flattery; and the complaints of the boatmen ceased, when they found that they could, without loss, negotiate the bill which they had received. Malik Shah is said to have travelled over his vast dominions twelve times-f. But this must allude to that part of them only which were under his immediate rule : for, if we include the territories of those princes whom he had conquered and obliged to do him homage, and to pay tribute, the limits of his dominions would extend from the Mediterranean to near the wall of China; as we are, indeed, informed, that prayers were every day offered up for his health in the cities of Jerusalem, Mecca, Medina, Bagdad, Isfahan, Rhe, Bokharah, Samarcund, Ourgunje, and Kashgar.

A noble sentiment; which must have propitiated that success which it only sought as the reward of superior piety and virtue. But the character of this prince has His conduct received a stain, which all his glory cannot efface.

His own fortune appeared to * De Guignes, Vol. III. page 223. f According to some Persian historians, Malik Shah owed, on one occasion, his life and liberty to this able minister. These state, that when at war with the Greek Emperor, Alexus I., the monarch was taken prisoner, but concealed his rank. The minister heard of the event, but spread a report that the king was returned to the camp; and kept the usual guards over his tent, to which he went frequently, on pretext of private interviews. He contrived to open a conference with the Greeks, and a truce was soon concluded. When settled, the Emperor Alexus said he had some Persian prisoners. ' They can be men of no consequence,' observed Nizam- ul-Mulk, ' for I did not know they were taken.' They were sent for; and the minister, addressing the king and his followers, said, ' Idle stragglers like you merit ' misfortune, and I do not care whether you are released or not.' The Greeks, conceiving their captives to be men of no consequence, gave them their liberty; and heard afterwards, with astonishment, that they had inadvertently liberated the monarch of Persia. The same fable (for such I consider it,) adds, that Alexus was afterwards made prisoner, and released by Malik Shah. Major Price conjectures, (and I have no doubt correctly,) that these stories, which he gives on the authority of the Kholasaat-ul-Ackbar, have some confused relation to what took place between Alp- Arselan and Romanus Diogenes.368 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . x. decline from the hour he took this measure ; and a nation, which for half a century had revered the sage whom he destroyed, saw, without regret, the changed lot of his ungrateful pupil. The accounts of this event differ a little, but they are easily reconciled. Toorkan Khatoon *, the principal sultana, hated the minister, because she feared that he would oppose her plans, of raising her infant son, Mahmood, to the throne, to the injury of the claims of his elder bro ther, Burkyaruk; who, from his birth and maturer age, was protected in his rights by the justice of Nizam-ul-Mulk. Influenced by this motive, she sought, by every means in her power, to poison the mind of the sultan against his minister. He was accused of possessing great power: his twelve sons, it was said, held the highest offices of the state: and his family enjoyed the whole patronage of the govern ment, in which the sultan was only a cipher. These accusations gained strength from an imprudent act of Mouad-u-dowlah, the eldest of the minister's sons. The king had desired that a person who enjoyed his favour should be employed by Mouad-u-dowlah, and the command had not been obeyed, on the ground of the man being incompetent to the station. But the sultan was easily per suaded that this neglect of his wishes had proceeded from other causes; and he not only dismissed Mouad-u-dowlah from his office, but gave it to the very person-f- whom that noble had refused to promote. This insult to his family was severely felt by Nizam-ul- Mulk, and his expressions of irritation were reported to the king; who, enraged at his supposed contumely, demanded the instant * This name, or title, means ' the Turkish lady,' and is always given to princesses of the Turkish descent. f The name of this favourite was Adil.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 3 g&lt; resignation of his ink-horn * and cap, which were the insignia of his chap. x. exalted station. The minister, as he gave them up, said, it was fit he should be required to resign power, when the vast dominions of the empire enjoyed a tranquillity of which he was the author f • ' When ' the sea was troubled,' he added, ' Malik Shah honoured me with his confidence; but all is now calm, and he listens to my calum niators. But he will not long be ignorant that the cap and ink- horn, which he has called upon me to resign, are connected, by a ' divine decree, with his crown and throne.' This hasty effusion of an old man, smarting under ingratitude, was conveyed, with exag geration, to the sultan, who was confirmed by it in all those unfavour able sentiments which had been before excited in his mind. A short time afterward, as the disgraced minister was following the royal camp from Isfahan to Bagdad, he was stabbed by an assassin J, employed by his successor in office, who feared a change in the sultan's sentiments. Nizam-ul-Mulk lived a short time after he received the fatal a. d. 1092. wound; and we are told, that the last moments of his life were A ' H - 485 ' occupied in writing some verses, which were addressed to Malik Shahjl.

Malik Shah survived his minister only a few months.

The kingdom he inherited, which extended from the plains of Tartary to those of Syria, was, during the twenty years he reigned, only disturbed by a short contest with his uncle and brother, immediately after his succession: and we cannot desire a better proof than this fact affords of his excellent government; or perhaps we should say, of that of his great minister; in whom, till within a few months of his death, he implicitly confided. The countiy of Persia was greatly improved during his reign : many colleges and mosques were built; and agriculture was promoted, by the construction of canals and water-courses. Learning was also encouraged; and an assembly of astronomers, from every part of Malik Shah s wide dominions, were employed for several years, in reforming the calendar: and their labours, which esta blished the Jellalean* or glorious era, is a proof of the attention which was given at this period to the noblest of all sciences. The history of the Seljookian princes, from the death of Malik Shah till the elevation of Sultan Sanjar, presents nothing but a detail of petty wars. It will be sufficient to notice the leading features of such a scene. The four sons of Malik Shah, Burkyaruk, Mahomed, away many kingdoms: but the chiefs they mention as princes, were only appointed his lieutenants. They succeeded in making themselves independent at his death. Among these were Soliman, the son of Kululmush, the founder of the celebrated Seljookian dynasty of Iconium. * This era, according to Doctor Hyde, commences the 15th of March, 1079, or the eleventh of Ramazan, in the year of the Hejirah four hundred and seventy-one. It was named Jellalean, in honour of the sultan, one of whose titles was Jullaledeen, or ' the glory of the state.'372 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . x.

The youngest (Mahmood,) was only four years of age when his father moo g d, 0 t™n died: but the ambition of his mother, the Sultana Khatoon Toorkan, placed the crown upon his infant head; and the Caliph a. h. 485. ]y | oc ht a di was prevailed upon to read the prayers in his name. The sultana marched to Isfahan, preceded by the corpse of Malik Shah. Burkyaruk, the eldest prince, was residing in that city, but, having no means of resistance, he retired to Rhe, attended by Mouad-u-doulah, the son of the late minister*; who, with all the adherents of his family, warmly espoused his cause. This sup port soon enabled him to return; and Khatoon Toorkan was compelled to resign a great part of her treasures, to obtain permission to keep possession of Isfahan: but all the schemes of aggrandisement which this ambitious woman had cherished, were some time afterwards terminated by her own death, and that of her sonf.

The usual residence of Burkyaruk was Bagdad.

Sanjar pre served his authority over his nephew by giving occasional counte nance to those that opposed him ; and he actually obliged him to restore to power an Arab chief, of the name of Dobais, who had plundered Bussorah, and attacked Bagdad*. Mahmood died at Hamadan, and is reputed to have been a mild and just prince. He desired to leave his crown to his son, Daood; but, at his death, both his brothers, Massoud and Seljook Shah, usurped the government, and united in an ineffectual attempt to oppose their uncle, Sanjar, who advanced into Persia, and placed the crown of the southern part of that kingdom, and of Arabia, on the head of his nephew, Toghrul, the son of Mahomed : but the authority of this prince was disputed the moment Sanjar returned to Khorassan; and the country was thrown into the greatest confusion by petty wars, in which the Arab chief, Dobais, and Zenghi-f, the independent Prince of Moussul and Aleppo, took a very conspicuous part. The murder of the caliphs Murtashed and Rashid Billah, by the assassins who, at this period, infested Persia, and whose history will be given, were among the most remarkable events that occurred during these disturbances. But it is time to turn from these scenes to the history of the Sultan Sanjar, who is deemed by many Ma- homedan authors, the best, if not the greatest of the Seljookian monarchs. Sanjar was, as before stated, one of the sons of Malik Shah. He held, at his father's death, the government of Khorassan, and took little concern in the troubles that ensued on that event: but * De Guignes. f This chief was father of the celebrated Noorudeen.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. o/a from the period of the death of hi S brother.

This monarch always resided in Khorassan: and from that centre extended his power, in one direction, beyond the Indus; and in another, to the Jaxartes. He forced Baharam Co.p.u.b. Shah, a monarch of the race of Ghizni, whose capital was Lahore, SZuX to pay him tribute; and Allah-u-deen*, Prince of Ghour, who '''' had defeated Baharam Shah and taken Ghizni, yielded in his turn to the superior fortune of Sanjar, by whom he was defeated and made prisoner, and only restored to liberty on the condition of becoming a tributary to the House of Seljook. Samarcund and Subd. e . s.- Bokharah were subdued : and, to render his magnificence complete, the kingdom of Khaurizm was bestowed on the chief cup-bearer of Sanjar: and this prince, when he returned to conrt, for a few months performed the duties of his former oflSce, clothed in his royal robes, which has led the flatterers of this sultan to say that he was served by kings. But Sanjar, after a long reign marked by singular glory and success, was destined to experience the most cruel reverses of fortune. He was persuaded to advance far into Tartary to attack the monarch f of Kara Khatay, and suffered a signal defeat, in which isdefeattdb, almost his whole army was cut to pieces, his family taken, and all his baggage plundered. The sultan ffed, with a few followers, to Khorassan, where he was reminded, by a flattering poet+, (who • Another name of this prince was Hussein.

The monarch whom he thus a. d. 1153. a. h. 548. consoled was reserved for still greater misfortunes. The Turkoman tribe of Ghuz had withheld their usual tribute of forty thousand Marches sheep.

A mission was sent to Ahmed-ben-Soliman, the ruler of Samarcund, (a prince whom Sanjar had first deposed, and afterwards restored to his throne,) to implore his aid: and among the letters which the ambassador Kumal-u-deen carried to that monarch, was a poetical address, entitled, ' The Tears of Khoras- ' san,' written by the celebrated Anveri, a native of that province. The ambition of genius could not have desired a nobler subject to exert all its powers, nor have hoped for higher reward than that applause which this effort has received from his countrymen. The whole of this poem, which is very long, has been trans lated by the late General Kirkpatrick; and the version is every where true to the sense and spirit of the original. The poet gives a faithful, but highly coloured picture of the ruin and desolation of Khorassan. In painting the miserable condition toTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 377 by the barbarous Ghuz, preyed upon his spirits, and plunged chap . x. him into a melancholy from which he never recovered : and this remarkable proof of his sensibility ^ to the condition of his sub jects, disposes us to believe the high eulogiums which all eastern which the barbarity of the tribe of Ghuz had reduced that province, he ex claims : — ' Is there, where ruin reigns in dreadful state, ' Whom fortune smiles on, or whom joys await ? ' 'Tis yonder corse descending to the tomb: ' Is there a spotless female to be found, ' Where deeds of diabolic lust abound ? ' 'Tis yonder infant issuing from the womb. ' The mosque no more admits the pious race; ' Constrain'd, they yield to beasts the holy place, ' A stable now, where dome nor porch is found; ' Nor can the savage foe proclaim his reign, ' For Khorassania's criers all are slain, ' And all her pulpits levelled with the ground.

' What though yon wretch was purchas'd by thy gold, ' ' Thy title's to his labour, not his health ;' Alas ! no slave that wretch, but one in whom A thousand graces and fair virtues bloom, ' By yon harsh tyrant spoil'd of countless wealth.' Anveri, in a subsequent part of this poem, makes the following impressive appeal to the sovereign he addresses : — « Oh thou of purest mind and noblest race ! ' The genial influence of the sun in spring ' By Him who gave that crown thy brow to grace; « To thee belongs, and is thy type, O king! ' Who gave, t' adorn the minted ore, thy name : « While Persia prospects of pil'd ruins yields; By Him —by Heaven's just King, we thee conjure, ' Then emulate the generous planet's praise, ' To loose our chains—our painful wounds to cure : ' Which sheds alike its bright impartial ravs, a So shall a grateful world thy praise proclaim. « On desolated towns and fruitful fields.

After the death of this monarch, Persia continued, for a period of forty years, to be distracted with the wars of different branches of Rule of the the Seljookian dynasty. The last who exercised power was Toghrul IheSe^ttan the Third*, who, after having overcome most of his rivals, and defeated a conspiracy of his nobles, gave himself up to every species of excess. The ruler of Khaurizm, who had, since the death of Sanjar, become an independent monarch, was invited to the attack of Persia by the discontented nobles of that country. He defeated Who is skin, and slew Toghrul, who is said to have shown great valour in the a.d. 1193. action in which he lost his life: but we are told by the same authors, A ' 590 ' that he went forth to this battle flushed with wine, and was unhorsed and killed by the monarch of Khanrizm, as he was singing, with a a. n. 1193. loud voice, some stanzas from the epic poem of Ferdosif, which A H ' 590 ' described the prowess of a victorious hero opening a passage for General oh- troops amid the dismayed ranks of his enemies.

A branch of this family, which ruled over the province of Kerman, had assumed the high title of sultan: but they exercised little more power than that of governors of provinces; and, like these, paid homage, or withheld it, according to the strength or weakness of the paramount authority. The Tartar tribe of Seljook had spread over almost all Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt. But when the families of the generals who had conquered these countries had obtained power, they threw off even the show of duty to their former masters, the sovereigns of Persia. The dynasties of Iconium and Aleppo are well known in western history, from the wars which they carried on with the armies of Europe engaged in the crusades. Both these governments fell before the fortune of an adventurer from the mountains of Kurdistan. The celebrated Sallah-u-deen was the son of Nizam-u-deen Aiyoub*, who was Kutwal, or com mander of the fort of Tukreet; a station which he was obliged to leave, because his brother, Assudeen Sheerkoh-f*, a brave youth, had slain a man of high family who had insulted an unprotected female The brothers found refuge at the Court of Nour-u- deen Mahmood, the ruler of Balbeck: and Assudeen Sheerkoh was afterwards sent, in command of a force, to aid Azad Ismail, the * Aiyoub's father, Shadi-ben-Mervan, was a Kurd from the village of Dewun.

On the death of Azad Ismail*, he assumed the government of Egypt, and soon afterwards all Syria submitted to his authority, and he became the successful champion of his religion. It is foreign to the plan of this work, to relate the actions of this great prince, who is justly celebrated, by eastern writers, for his courage, humanity, and great talents, both as a warrior and a statesman.

The events of Sallah-u-deen's life, as given in this work, corresponds exactly with D'Herbelot, except in the account which the latter gives of the contracted marriage between Malick-ul- Adil, the brother of Sallah-u-deen, and the sister of the King of England: on this point the Kurdish history is silent.

His son, Jellal-u-deen, who was the last of this dynasty of kings, long bore up, with exemplary fortitude, against the torrent that had overwhelmed his father: but he was at last sub dued by the vicissitudes of his fortune; and from having been an object of universal love and admiration, he became one of detestation and of contempt. The hero, who, by swimming the Indus after the most gallant efforts to defeat his enemies, had extorted the applause of Chenghiz, was, in his latter years, only remarkable for his indolence and excesses; and the termination of his career was as inglorious as its commencement had been noble and heroic. He fled from a small detachment of Moghuls, and took refuge in the hills of Kurdistan, where he was slain by a barbarian, whose brother he had before put to death. 381 CHAP. X. A. D. 1230. A. H. 628.

F rom the time of the decline of the d3'nasty of Seljook to the conquest of Persia by Hulakoo Khan, the son of Chenghiz, (which occupies a period of more than a century,) that country was dis tracted by the contests of a number of petty princes, or governors, called Atta-begs*; who, taking advantage of the weakness of the last monarchs of the race of Seljook, and the distractions that followed their final extinction, established their authority over some of the finest provinces of the empire. Many of these petty dynasties acquired a local fame, which, to this day, gives an importance to their memory with the inhabitants of those countries over which they ruled. They are mentioned in every History of Persia; and it becomes impossible, therefore, to pass them over in silence. A short notice of some of the most eminent will show the character of their rule, and give a picture of that condition into which an Asiatic nation usually falls, on the decline of the power of its monarchs. * The word Atta-beg is Turkish : it is a compound word of atta, master or tutor, and beg, lord; and signifies a governor, or tutor, of a lord or prince.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 38s One of the most distinguished of these Atta-begs was Illij Guz*, a chap. xi.

Most of the tribes in Laristan are an aboriginal race, and the lan guage at present spoken in that province is a dialect of the Pehlivi. The Turkish conquerors of Persia had little temptation to invade their mountains; and, if they had done so, it is probable they would not have been successful; for the hardy inhabitants cherished an independence, which Nature had made it easy for them to defend. Accident, however, rendered this proud and savage race subject, for a considerable time, to chiefs of foreign descent. In the various migrations of the tribes of Tarlary, several of them have, at different periods, either come or been brought from the plains of Syria-f into Persia: a hundred families of one of these * Zeenut-ul-Tuarikh. t The Shamloo, or ' Sons of Syria,' are, perhaps, at this moment one. of the most numerous of all the Turkish tribes in Persia.

After taking this revenge, the animal ran howling to the tents of his master's family; who, observing it without Aly, instantly anticipated some misfortune: and in this they were confirmed by the dog turning round, and, while it continued to howl, running off towards the mountains.

' Give me a horse,' said the youth, —^that will bear me proudly in the day of battle.'—' Ask again,' said Sunkur.—' If you do not deem it improper/' said Abou Taher, ' create me an Atta-beg/'—' Ask again/' was the reply.— ' Then grant me some troops, and I will reduce to your authority ' the tribes of Laristan ||/' The Atta-beg complied with all these His grandson, requests; and the young soldier marched, with a force of five thousand marched^nto men, into the country from which his grandfather had been com- Lanstan, p e j le( j to depart.

Enough has been said to illustrate the reigns of those races of chiefs and princes, who usurped upon the weakness of the latter monarchs of the Seljookian dynasty, and enjoyed a local power, till they were swept away by the hordes of Tartary, under the celebrated Hulakoo : but we find, at this period of Persian history, a power existing in that country, of a very different nature Rule ofHus- to any that has been yet noticed.

Their ruler, who may be justly termed the chief of the assassins*, resided on a lofty mountain, and fate was in his hands; for there was no shape which his followers could not assume, no danger that they would not brave, to fulfil his mandates. More than fifty thousand men gloried in the name of the mysterious and the devotedf; and every one of these obeyed, with * A colony of the sect of Ismail, and followers of Hussun Subah, appear to have settled in the mountains between Tortosa and Tripolis. Their chief is called, by the historian of the Crusades, the Old Man of the Mountain, (or the Ancient): and they made themselves formidable by the same means as those settled in Persia, of whom Monsieur Maimbourg, (who writes the History of the Holy War,) terms them a branch. He states, that their name, ' assassin,' was from a Pershm word, and that ' they came from the confines of Persia beyond Babylon.' He records their murder of the Marquess Conrade in A.

The name of B&amp;ttenee, which is derived from batten, « secret' or « mysterious,' means a secret or mys terious person.

The history of such a community has peculiar interest, as it presents the human character in a new and an uncommon light. The first of these chiefs was Hussun Subah; and from him they are termed Hussunee*, or the followers of Hussun. Hussun Subah was first a mace-bearer to Alp-Arselan; but, in consequence of a quarrel with Nizam-ul-Mulk, the minister of that princef, he retired to Rhe X' and from thence went to Syria, where he entered into the service of a chief of the family of Ismail, and adopted the tenets of that sect; who maintain, that the descendants of Ismail, the eldest son of Jaaffer, the sixth Imaum, who died during his father's life, should have succeeded to that holy dignity: and they, in consequence, not only reject the right of Kauzim, the seventh Imaum, who was the youngerI| brother of Ismail, but of all those who succeeded him. Hussun, after becoming a zealous convert to the doctrines of this sect, returned to Persia; but was compelled to conceal himself, as a. d. 1071, 1078. a. h. 464, 471. Il I ifei description of this sect, vide Asiatic Researches, Vol. XI. page 423 and 424. The word Fedavee means ' a devoted servant.' * The English word assassin is said to be formed from a corruption of this term. t Hussun Subah was a school-fellow of Nizam-ul-Mulk; and they had (with another companion,) made an early agreement to share fortunes, if either attained eminence. The minister appointed Hussun to office; but the eager mind of that chief was not to be satisfied with gradual advancement. After failing in an attempt to supplant and ruin his friend, he abandoned the court. X Tuarikh Guzedah.

He lived, we are told, at Isfahan, in the house of Rais* Aboul Fazel Lumbhanee: to whom he one day observed, ' That, if he had two ' or three friends on whom he could entirely depend, he would ' overturn the empiref.' The good Rais heard, with astonishment, his guest speak of destroying, by the aid of two or three men, a kingdom that stretched from Antioch to Kashgar. He, however, made no reply at the moment: but, on reflection, he concluded that Hussun was deranged in his intellects: and having consulted a physician, he obtained some medicine, which he brought; and, with all the sincerity of simplicity and good-nature, prayed his friend to take it. Hussun smiled, but made no further commu nications to one who, he saw, from this occurrence, was not of a character to be intrusted with the designs he had formed. Soon after this event, he departed for his native town, Rhe, where he met with some discontented persons, who declared themselves ready to grant him their assistance. The principal of these was Rais MuzufFer, who appears to have been a man of considerable influence. The first object of Hussun was to possess himself of a strong hold; and he succeeded in gaining, by a stratagem J, the mountain Fort of Allaha- * The word Rais may be' translated esquire, according to the ancient signification of that word in English. It implies, in Persian, the possession of landed estate, and some magisterial power. The Rais is in general the hereditary head of a village.

But this appears a common fable in the East: for Moullah Saaduck, a very respectable man,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ m out% near Kazveen^. From this fortress he commenced depre- chap. xi. dations on the surrounding country; which led Malik Shah Sel- jookee to detach a force to reduce him. Hussun had only tached to re- seventy followers with him at this period, and was on the point ducehmi ' of being taken: when a seasonable succour of three hundred men He receives a from Rhe, enabled him to make a successful sally, which induced the'royliarmy the sultan's army to raise the siege. It was at this time that the raisethes5e g e - celebrated Nizam-ul-Mulk fell into disgrace with Malik Shah J, and was assassinated, as before mentioned ||, by one of the followers of Hussun Subah, who, upon this occasion, readily united with the enemies of that great man : and we may conclude, that while he gratified personal revenge, he contemplated the death of this minister as an event which was likely to throw the kingdom into that state of confusion which was requisite for the accomplishment of his own plans of ambition. Although the divisions which distracted Persia after the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk, and of Malik Shah, were most favourable to Hussun, he was soon afterwards in great danger of being destroyed by the celebrated Sultan Sanjar; who had, we are informed §, resolved to Sultan sanjar extirpate, ere they gained greater strength, a race, whose murders and rceMm. 0 '*' with whom I read this passage in the original Persian, smiled when we came to it, and said: ' The English are well acquainted with this deception.'—I asked what he meant: ' Why,' said he, ' is it not known to all the world that this is the exact mode ' in which you obtained the ground on which Calcutta is built from the poor Emperor ' of Delhi?!' * This fortress is sometimes called Almowut.

He had made some marches in the direction of Allahamout, when, waking one morning, he discovered a poniard stuck up to the hilt in the ground close to his bed-side, and read, with surprise, the following label on its handle: « Sultan Sanjar, beware! Had not thy character been respected, the « hand that stuck this dagger into the hard ground, could, with « more ease, have plunged it into thy soft bosom*.' The warrior, who was insensible to fear in the field of battle, is said to have trembled as he read this scrollf; and it is certain that he desisted from the attack he had meditated. It is related, that some time before this period, Hussun Subah received a visit from his old host at Isfahan, Rais Aboul Fazel. When the latter approached, the chief took his hand, and said, with a smile, ' Have you brought any physic, my good friend, to cure me ' of my insanity ? or will you now believe, that two or three brave « men, united, can do wonders?'—' I always thought you an ' able man,' replied Aboul Fazel, 44 but I never expected you would « have done what you have.'—' My task is only half accomplished,' said Hussun: ' I have hitherto trusted chiefly to my political skill, ' but I mean now to try what faith can effect.'

The Koran, he admitted, was a holy volume: but he insisted that its spirit, and not its literal meaning, was to be observed. He rejected the usual modes of worship: as true devotion was, he said, seated in the soul; and prescribed forms might disturb, though they could never aid, that secret and fervent adoration which it must always offer to its Creator*. But the principal tenet which Hussun Subah inculcated, was a complete and absolute devotion to himself and to his descendants. His disciples were instructed to consider him more as their spiritualf than their worldly leader. The means he took to instil this feeling into their minds must have been power ful, from the effect which was produced. When an envoy from Malik Shah came to AUahamout, Hussun commanded one of his subjects to stab himself; and another, to cast himself headlong from a precipice. Both mandates were instantly obeyed! ' Go/' said he to the astonished envoy, ' and explain to your master the character ' of my followers/' We are informed, that among other modes which he adopted to secure the devotion of his disciples, there was one of an extraordinary nature.

In a second intoxication, the deluded disciple was carried to his home, and easily persuaded that he had been permitted, through the power of Hussun, to taste, by anticipation, the joys of Paradise. But this seems an improbable tale, invented* by Mahomedans, who hold this sect in great abhorrence. The use of wine was strictly forbidden to the sect of Hussunee: and they were enjoined the most temperate and abstemious habits. He enforced his precepts with the greatest severity: and two of his sons, we are told, perished under the blows he gave them, in conse quence of their neglect of them. We may judge of the little personal state which he assumed, when informed, that, on sending his wife and two daughters to his friend, Rais Muzuffer, that they might be in safety when he was besieged, he directed that they should receive no support but what they could earn by their spinning; thus setting an example to his followers of that moderation and independence which were necessary to the success of their community.

The first of this dynasty was Aboul Kausim, who began his reign in the year of the Hejirah 296, (A. D, 998.) The last, Adhed, resigned his power in the year of the Hejirah 567, (A. D. 1171,) to the famous Sallah-u-deen. It was Ul-Kausim, the sixth of this race, that the author alludes to as the destroyer of vineyards. That rigid caliph ordered all the vines in the vicinity of Cairo to be cut down ; and forbade even the frequent intercourse of females of different families ; but the Egyptians accused him of being indulgent to vice in his own family: and his death was caused by an intrigue of his sisters. f Tuarikh Guzedah.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xi. to express his abhorrence of this race, and their tenets, in the pulpit*. Sometime after he had uttered this anathema, he was surprised to see a man, who had been one of his most attentive disciples for several days, enter his private chamber; and still more, when seizing him by the beard, and pointing a dagger to his breast, this person asked him if he knew who he was. ' I am quite ignorant who you are/' said the trembling divine, ' and still less can I conjecture why you seek &lt;c my life.'—' You abused the sect of Ismail!' said the man.—' I &lt;e was wrong/' replied the learned doctor: ' I repent, and will never do so again,'—Swear by the holy prophet to what you have now said!' cried the assailant.—' I swear!' said the Imaum. —' Very well' said the man, quitting his hold. ' I have particu- lar Orders not to slay you, or my poniard should, before this, have ' been crimsoned with the blood of your heart. Allah-u-deen desires ' me to present you his respects, and to ask you if you are well ' informed of the tenets of that sect which you have dared to abuse ? ' He advises you to be most careful of your future conduct; and, as ' he has a respect for your character, he sends you this bag, which ' contains three hundred and sixty gold mohurs; and here is an order ' for a similar sum to be paid you annually by one of his agentsf.' The divine took the money, and continued for many years to receive his pension. His pupils could not but remark, that, in his future lectures, he carefully abstained from any mention of the followers of Ismail. He was wont to observe, in reply to such observations, with a suppressed smile, that he had been convinced, by some sharp and weighty arguments, that it was better not to enter into any discussion regarding the doctrines of that sect. * Tuarikh Guzedah. f Tuarikh Guzedah.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 405 The rule of AUah-u-deen was long* and prosperous: he was chap , xi, succeeded by his son, Jellal-u-deen Hussein, who was the first of this race that cultivated, with success, the friendship of neigh- bouring rulers. Even the Caliph of Bagdad relaxed from his Zte' '' orthodoxy, and showered honours upon the envoy of this princef: and, in reply to a reference made to him by the Governor of Ghilan, whose sister Jellal-u-deen desired to marry, the Commander of the Faithful wrote, that such an alliance would be an honour to the noblest family in his dominions. Jellal-u-deen engaged in no war, except with the Governor of Irak; and the first cam paign closed, as was usual, in the death of the person who had ventured to attack the Chief of the Mountains. The conquests of Chenghiz Khan commenced about this period; and an envoy was deputed to Transoxania, from the Court of Allahamout, to pro pitiate the hero. Jellal-u-deen died the following year. He is cele- a ii eio brated in Persian history for the kindness and generosity of his dis position ; and we are informed, that this prince of the assassins was the handsomest man of his age. His son, Allah-u-deen Mahomed, Ho , e of w. a boy of ten years of age, was next elevated to the rule: and this young prince J, soon after his succession, put to death all his prin- n '' 1 ' cipal officers, on a pretext that they had poisoned his father.

As a means of recovering him from this condition, his ministers were desirous of obtaining for him the society of Nasser-u-deen*, the most celebrated philosopher of the age: but that able man, who resided at Bokharah, rejected all the offers that were made to tempt him to so barbarous a court as that of Allaha- mout-f. He had, however, to negotiate with a ruler whose agents were accustomed to consider his will as a divine mandate. The officer who governed the country of Kohistan $ under Allah-u-deen received an order to produce the philosopher; and, as Nasser-u-deen was one day sauntering in the gardens near Bokharah, he was sud denly surrounded by some men 3 who, pointing to a horse, desired him to mount, promising him good usage if he made no resist ance.

An Account of the Conquest of Persia by the Moghuls, and of the Reign of Hulakoo Khan, and his Successors, in that Country. T he Tartars have been already deseribed. We are no «r come to a chap.xii. period when all the families of that great nation were either united, or subdued, by the genius of one chief; who, on being declared sovereign of the tribes of Tartar j, formed the vast project of reducing the whole of Asia under his dominion. Temugin, the son of a Khan, or chief of the tribe of Moghuls, after almost unexampled vicissitudes, obtained, at the age of forty-nine, a complete victory* over all those who had endeavoured to effect his ruin. He was, at this period, not a.d. i 2 o 2 . only considered by his own tribe as their deliverer from the tyranny A,H - 599 - ofOung Khan f, the chief of the Keraites, whose armies he had * Almost all the soldiers of Tartary were engaged in this great action. The historian, Mirkhond, endeavours to describe their numbers by a truly oriental hyper bole. « The neighing of their steeds,' he states, ' made Heaven shut its ears, and their ' arrows coaverted the whole sky into one great field of reeds.' The army of Oung Khan, which was defeated, left forty thousand dead upon the field of battle. Their monarch escaped, to perish by the treachery of the Khan of the Naimans, who, after receiving him in a friendly manner, put him to death. t Marco Polo, a Venetian priest, who travelled in Tartary about the year one thousand two hundred and fifty of the Christian era, calls this prince Um Khan. He also terms him ' Prester John;' and this name is given him by some other authors; vol. i. 3 g410 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xii. defeated, but deemed, by a great majority of the Khans of Tartary, as worthy of the high dignity of Khakan, or emperor; to confer which, an assembly*, or national council, was summoned. It met at the spot of Temugin's birth: and that chief, we are informed, after addressing the Khans in an eloquent harangue, was seated upon a black feltf, or nummud, and reminded of the importance of the duties to which he was called, by an orator, who spoke in the name a. d. 1205. of the nation. After this speech, seven Khans lifted up Temugin, a. h . cos. ^ carr ied him to a high throne, in the midst of the assembly. The Temugin is moment he was seated on this throne, he was saluted as Khakan}, elected em- ^ em p eror . and not only the chiefs, but all that were present, pledged their obedience to their future sovereign, by bending their knee nine successive times before him. The air at the same time resounded but it appears more likely to belong to the Dalai Lama, the chief priest of the Tartars. Piccard 16 supposes this name to be a jargonish compound of pretre, the French for « priest,' and jehan, which in Persian means ' the world,' and signifying ' the Pontiff of the Universe:' but prester seems a contraction of presbyter, ' a priest,' from which the French word pretre itself comes. It is not impossible but Oung Khan had been converted to Christianity by the Nestorian Missionaries, and received the name of John at his baptism. This conjecture is, at least, more probable than that the Khan of the Keraik assumed a mixed European and Persian title. The Tartar tribes have, at no period, condescended to borrow names, or titles, from the Persians. * Coroultai is the name by which this assembly of the Tartar nobles is called. t This felt, dignified by the fortune of Chenghiz, was long preserved by his succes sors, and considered almost as a sacred relic. % This ceremony took place three years after he had been acknowledged Khan of his own tribe. Vol. IV. page 353.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 411 with shouts of joy; and Temugin* (who upon this occasion assumed chap.xii. the name of Chenghiz Khan,) assured his voluntary subjects, that he would repay the great honours they had bestowed upon him by tZZcL making their name famous in the farthest regions of the earth. It is ghizKhan - foreign to the subject of this history to relate the actions of Chenghiz Khan; but the rules which that extraordinary monarch established for the civil government of the country, and of his army, cannot be passed unnoticed. His ordinances for the civil administration of his civil ordi- territories were, perhaps, indifferently observed; but his military regu- tTSedby lations formed the basis of the only discipline that has ever been ^' u introduced into the armies of his successors. The majority of the subjects of Chenghiz were idolators, but all were commanded to obey one supreme and all-powerful Creator; and those who subscribed to this leading tenet, were allowed to follow what mode of worship they thought properf. He forbade any Khan, or prince, to proclaim him self Khakan, or emperor, without a regular assembly of the chiefs of the tribes, which was commanded to be conducted in the same manner as that which had taken place at his own election. He * This chief was of a high family; but the flatterers of his greatness give him a celestial descent, pretending that the Princess Alankoua (the grand-daughter of Yelduz-Khan,) had conceived from a ray of the sun, and bore, as she had foretold she would, three sons; one of which, Buzunjur, was the immediate ancestor of Chenghiz. Major Price, on the authority of the Hubbeeb-ul-Seyur, states, that Alankoua, the mother of Buzunjur, dreamt that her conception was from a person she saw in a dream, with a flaming torch, and that the rays of light were seen to enter the pavilion in which she slept. She had three sons at a birth, and they were called ' the children of light.'— P rice's Mahomedan History, Vol. II. page 472. t Petit de la Croix's History of Chenghiz Khan, page 79-THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xii . forbade the use of titles, and claimed for himself only that of Khan, or Khakan. He ordained, in the true spirit of a ruler of Tartary, that peace should never be made with a nation on whom the Tartars had once made war, till it was subdued*. Every subject of the Kha kan was compelled, in some mode or other, to serve the state. Those who were not soldiers were obliged to work a certain number of days annually, for the benefit of the country; and one day of their labour in every week was the right of the emperor. Theft, when the article was of value, was death; when trifling, it was punished by flogging: but this punishment was remitted if the party con sented to pay nine times the value of the article stolen. No Tartar could employ a person of his own nation as a domestic servant: an important regulation, which, while it nourished a proud spirit and increased the number of soldiers, forced the Tartars to take care of their captives, for the purpose of employing them in menial offices. Polygamy was admitted : but the children by wives ranked higher than those by slaves; though the latter were not despised. Adulterers were put to death. One tribe, however, (that of Kaindu,) murmured at this law, as it was with them a custom to lend their wives to their friends-f. The Khakan made an exception in their favour, but stampt them, on account of this shameful usage, with ignominy. The importance of terminating feuds among the tribes of Tartary is very great: one of the modes by which this is often effected, is by intermarriages. To extend the operation of so desirable a practice, Chenghiz permitted J two families to unite their deceased children in * Petit de la Croix's History of Chenghiz Khan, page 81. t Ibid. p. 86. + Travels of Rubruquis. -.asaik.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 41c a contract of marriage; and the relationship established by this act* chap . xir. was the same as if the parties were living. These are some of the principal civil regulations which he ordained. His imperfect code was well adapted to the society for whose improvement it was intended. It contained little, but it was established among a people whose habits were those of savage life, and who were impatient of restraint. The privilege which Chenghiz had assumed of framing laws for his subjects, belonged, of course, to his suc cessors, who were at liberty to change or revoke what he had instituted. His ordinances, therefore, can perhaps only be looked upon as formal and solemn precepts for the guidance of his de scendants f: but, even in that light, such institutions had a great value, for they derived respect from their source, and could never be infringed without danger of serious discontent. The military regulations of Chenghiz were simple, but well Military re- adapted to an army composed like that which he commanded. fauS by His force was divided into tomauns, or divisions, of ten thousand kh I * each, under a general. These tomauns were subdivided into corps of one thousand each: to every one of which there was a com mander, appointed by the emperor. This corps was subdivided * This is said to be still an usage in Tartary. They throw the contract in the fire, and conceive the smoke ascends to the departed children, who marry in the other world. Petit de la Croix, in his Life of Chenghiz, mentions this fact; and I find it stated in a Persian MS., written by a man of learning and information. t These laws were observed by his immediate successors, and probably remained in force till the conversion of the Tartars to the religion of Mahomed. Sultaun Shahrokh, the son of Timour, in his letter to Day-ming, Emperor of China, expressly states, ' That he governs his possessions according to the dictates of the holy law of ' the prophet, and its positive and negative precepts, and that the institutions of Chen- ' ghiz have been abolished.'— Asiatic Miscellany, Vol. I. page 89.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 414 chap . xn. into ten companies, of one hundred men each, and these into sections of ten, and an officer was nominated to every company and section. All the officers, from the general of a tomaun to the commander of a section of ten men, were registered, and made responsible for those under them. Attention was paid to the dif ferent tribes in these regulations, and their chiefs were the principal officers of Chenghiz. A camp, or wurdu, consisting of several tomauns, or divisions, of ten thousand, was allotted to each of his four sons, whom he employed as his principal generals. There were strict regulations established in the army regarding booty taken from the enemy. No person could plunder without an order: but when that was issued, the lowest soldier had as full a right to what he took as his leader. The army of Chenghiz, which exceeded six hundred thousand men, was never idle. A campaign against an enemy was less har- rassing than that exercise which he gave them in hunting, when he was not engaged in any military enterprise. By one of his laws, no person was allowed to kill game, of any description, from March till October*, the season at which the grand hunt commenced. A central plain was fixed upon, and the army thrown round it at a distance of more than a hundred miles. This immense circle was gradually reduced, and the greatest care was taken to cover the whole country, so as to drive the game towards one point. As they approached this, the ranks of the divisions closed, and every effort was used to prevent the multitude of different animals from making their escape: and this was more difficult, as the troops were not allowed to kill them. When all had reached their desli- * Petit de la Croix's History of Chenghiz Khan, page 82.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. nation, the emperor erected his throne upon an eminence, from whence he could see the whole plain; and every tribe was allowed to send some of its bravest youth, who displayed before their monarch their courage and skill in combats with the most furious of the wild beasts. Chenghiz sometimes amused himself with the chase, and at others allowed the princes of the blood to dispute, in the attack of the lion and the tiger, the prize of valour with the lowest of his subjects*. The army was usually engaged in this hunt during the whole of the winter; and, while the severity of the season inured his troops to fatigue, Chenghiz had, in the course of the hunt, an. opportunity of judging of the skill and courage of both his officers and soldiers; for, in traversing countries interspersed with forests, mountains, and rivers, success depended, in a great degree, upon the judgment of the leaders and the alacrity of the men; and frequent opportunities were offered for a display of superior activity and bravery. When the carnage had been con siderable, some of the youngest princes advanced to his throne, and, kneeling before him, solicited his mercy for the surviving game-f-. Their petition was granted; and, at a signal, the army opened its ranks, and the affrighted animals fled, in every direc tion, towards their native plains and mountains |. * Persian Manuscript. t Petit de la Croix's History of Chenghiz Khan, page 266.

Marco Polo, who travelled in the thirteenth century, describes Gambalu, the capital of Khatai, as a noble city, nearly twenty-four miles in circumference: but this space included, no doubt, the gardens of the emperor and his nobles. The site of Cambalu was on the north bank of a river, which flowed through one of the finest provinces of northern China. Major Price, on the authority of the Hubbeeb-ul-Seyur, states, that Kublai Khan, the grandson of Chenghiz, founded the City of Khan Baligh, (or Cambalu,) which he terms the Pekin of the moderns: and if the name Cambalu be a corruption of Khan Baligh, which means the residence of the Khan, or capital, we may conclude this appellation has, at different periods, been given to different cities, vol . i. 3 ri418 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xii. ment and admiration at the conduct of the vanquished hero, who, w hen compelled to fly, plunged with his horse into the Indus, and swam to the opposite bank, discharging arrows upon the Moghuls from the midst of those waves that threatened him with destruction. Chenghiz would not allow him to be pursued; and, turning to his a. d. 1221. children, he exclaimed: ' How proud a son must be who has such A H ' 618 ' « a father! He that dares defy the dangers which this prince has ' now escaped, may expose himself to a thousand others; and a ' wise man, who has so daring an enemy, ought to be always upon ' his guard*.' Extent of his The whole of Persia was either subdued or overrun by the armies dominions. ^ Chenghiz, whose dominions, before his death, extended from the Indus to the Euxine; from the banks of the Volga, to the distant plains of China; and from the arid shores of the Persian Gulf, to the cold wastes of Siberia. The ravages committed by this monarch were terrible: and we have received an account of them through the medium of Mahomedan authors, who have probably exaggerated the cruelties of a prince who regarded their religion with abhor rence. After Bokharah was taken, these authors relate, that pious and learned men were compelled to perform the lowest and most menial offices for their savage conquerors. ' The Moghuls,' one writer observes, ' made stables of the libraries of that city. All the ' books/' he adds, ' which they contained were destroyed: and, by ' an act of unexampled profanation, the leaves of the holy Koran ' were used for litter to their horses, who trampled upon the sacred ' sentences of Mahomed -f.' * Petit de la Croix's History of Chenghiz, page SI9- + Tuarikh Guzedah.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 419 Chenghiz, we are told, lived to regret the dreadful desolation chap. xii. he had made, and proposed to rebuild many of the cities that he had destroyed; but age and infirmity warned him that his end was approaching, and he assembled all his family, whom he earnestly exhorted to live in concord* with each other, and to observe the laws which he had established. All promised obedience; and the Khakan expired at the advanced age of seventy-three, having lived Death of to complete the vast projects he had early formed, and to give to each of his four sons J a great kingdom.

He was a hnmane and generous prince, well calcnlated to heal those wounds which the insatiable ambition of his great but cruel father had inflicted. This monarch continued to be guided by the wise counsels of his brother, Chaghtai*, the most pious and accom plished of all the sons of Chenghiz; and although Chaghtai suc ceeded, by the will of his father, to the kingdoms of Transoxama, Bulkh, Buduchsan, and Kashgar, he governed these countries by deputies, and remained himself with his brother, Octai, by whom he was regarded with that reverence which a pupil gives to his master-f*. The kingdoms of Persia, Khorassan, and Cabul, were assigned to Tuli Khan, the fourth'son of Chenghiz; but that prince died J a,d.i25s. soon after his father. He left several sons: among whom the two AH ' 651 ' eldest were the most famous; Mangou Khanll, who succeeded * This name is commonly spelt Zagatai; but Chaghtai is more eonsonant to the Turkish pronunciation. , t t t We have a remarkable proof of that respect and reverence in wh.ch the lartars held Chaghtai, in the permanence of his fame, both as the parent and instrnctor of h,s people. A nation assumed his name, terming themselves the Ouloss, or tribe, o Chaghtai, by which they are still called; and the most polished dialect of Tark.sh, is termed Chaghtai, in memory of the prince through whose learning and encourage- ment of learned men it was brought to its present excellence. J He died three years after Chenghiz. H There is a curious account of this emperor and his court in the Travels of William De Rubruquis, who, it has been before stated, was sent into Tartary by Louis the Ninth of France, when that sovereign was in Palestine. Rubruquis was first sent to Sartach Khan, the son of the famous Batoo Khan, to congratulate him upon is becoming a Christian: but the report of his conversion proved untrue.

Hulakoo, when detached by his brother, Mangou Khan, to Hulakoo subdue Persia, was attended by a chosen army* of veteran soldiers. dutVe^a. His first enterprise, which has been already mentioned, entitled him to the gratitude of the country he came to conquer. The extirpa tion of the power of the sect of Ismail, and the destruction of the strong holds of these assassins, was an act which merited a nation's gratitude and we receive a favourable impression of the conqueror's character from the joy he testified at being able to release Nasser-u- deen, and the great estimation in which he continued to hold the cha racter of that eminent philosopher. Hulakoo, we are informed, had intended to march direct towards Constantinople, but was persuaded by Nasser-u-deen to turn his arms against Bagdad. His new coun- French monk on to his father, and he compelled him to proceed to the Court of Mangou Khan, who treated him kindly, though he appears to have slighted the arguments by which the good Ruhruquis endeavoured to make him change his faith.

He is said, among other parts of his equipment, to have had a thousand families of Chinese artificers, who were skilled in the construction of military machines, and in preparing and usyig every species of inflammable substances, which were then much used in the attack of walled towns.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 422 chap. xii . sellor, whose fame as an astrologer was very high, assured him t he stars had decreed, that the House of Abbas should fall before that of Chenghiz*; and this prophecy, like many others, produced Makes war op- its own accomplishment.

He veiled his treachery in a show of confidence, and lulled Mustasim into a fatal security, grounded upon a contempt of his enemy : but we require no such causes to account for the subjection of the caliph by the Tartar conqueror. % Persian authors have given the most exaggerated accounts of this massacre.

The nations of the West were as familiar with the name and reputation of Abaka as those of the East. He had married the daughter of Michael Paleeologus, Emperor of Constantinople, who had been betrothed to his father, but arrived at Maragha after the death of that prince. This circum stance, and the connexion he formed with some of the potentates of Europe, when at war with the ruler of Syria and Egypt, have given rise to an opinion that he had embraced the Christian faith. But this fact is not supported by any satisfactory proof: and it is certain, that whatever private opinions he might have entertained, he never made a public profession of that religion.

The following character of this prince is given by De Gnignes, One of the most learned of European writers on Asiatic history. « The rule of the Moghuls (hitherto severe and barbarous) changed its character in « the reign of this prince, who adopted entirely the manners of the Chinese; and who ' is regarded, even by that people, as one of the best and most illustrious of their « emperors. His reign was remarkable for great men, and great events. The reason ' was, that the sovereign himself was great. Under him the arts and sciences ' flourished. His object was to render his people happy, by rewarding merit wher- « ever he found it, by encouraging agriculture, and promoting the increase of manu- « factures and of commerce. If the Chinese have often been conquered,' adds De Guignes, « their laws have escaped that fate; for to them the conquerors of the nation « have, in their turn, submitted. Most of the Moghuls abandoned their rude habits; « and a great proportion, imitating the Chinese, became remarkable for their love of « their country and prince. The greatest crime in China is to fail in respect or « obedience to a parent, and the emperor is deemed the father of his people. —Hist. Gen. des Huns, fyc. Vol. IV. page 267.

The author of this scheme was an officer* in the 0M ' bliihe '' iu tuc paper cur- revenue department, of reputed talent. He proposed to' introduce, '° cy ' in lieu of specie, a paper exchange, of the same description which,' our author states, was then in use in Chinaf: and when it became a medium of value in all commercial concerns, it was expected that it would (without injury to individuals) cause the whole gold and silver of the country to flow into the royal treasury; and, by that operation, give new life and vigour to the government. The vizier of Key Khatou, and the officer who proposed this a.d., sm . scheme, are said to have corresponded with the minister $ of the A ' H - 694 ' • His name was Ezuddeen Muzaffer.

But we find, from the Travels of Marco Polo, that at the very date at which this measure must have been in con templation, that noble Venetian, accompanied by his father and uncle, was at the Court of Persia. They had been residing for many years at the Court of Kublai Khan, the Emperor of Tartary and China; and when that sovereign complied with a request, made through some ambassadors sent by Arghoun Khan, to give their master in mar' nags a princess of the imperial family, the Venetians accompanied the train of that lady, who was also attended by some high nobles of Tartary, and the ambassadors of Arghoun. The party came by sea from China. They appear to have stopped at Java, and several other places, and were eighteen months on the passage. When they reached Persia, Arghoun Khan was dead, and his place occupied by his brother, Key Khatou; who, Marco Polo states, only governed the kingdom for the son of Arghoun,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 432 c „ a p xn Emperor of China and Tartary before they communicated the plan to their master, whom they found ready to grasp at any shadow that promised relief to his distress*. A proclamation was issued, pro hibiting the use of the precious metals, either as a medium of value in trade, or in any species of manufacture, further than what might be required for the monarch. To provide a circulating medium, it was ordained that stamp, or banking houses, should be established in every city and town in Persia, where bank-notes should be made and issued. It was at the same time ordered, that all goldsmiths, embroiderers, and money-changers, who might be deprived of em ployment by the introduction of this scheme, should be indemnified by an annual stipend paid in the new notes. This strange and crude plan was actually carried into execution. Banking houses were erected every where. They were called or ' The Wpticof ' House of Stamps, or Notes.' The tshauf, or bank-note, was an ,h e b&lt;!«v-n&lt;«» ob iece of pa per, containing a short inscription in Khataeen, or Chinese characters, and exhibiting, on each side, the Mahomedan who was un&lt;kr age: and he adds, that Key Khatou direeted that the Tartar princess whom the, had hronght for Arghonn shonld be given in marriage to Gha Z a„. the son of the deceased monarch. This mission must have reached the Court of Tahreez in t e year 1298, or 1293, as Arghoun did not die till the end of 1291; and the Veueuan nobles, after'remaining nine months in Persia, and visiting several countries on the.r journey towards home, reached Venice in 1295. The relation of Marco Polo shows that ey Khatou had. at his court, not only ambassadors from China, and some of h,s own ministers who had retarned from that cbuntry, but intelligent Europeans, who, from what they had seen both in their native country and China, were very likely to be con sulted regarding the scheme of establishing a paper currency. • He is stated to have been, at this period, considerably more than two mi ions sterling in debt. t Probably a Chinese word.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. confession of faith*, and the words Eerantchie and Routchee, which seem to have been titles bestowed upon the kings of Persia by the great Khan of Tartaryf.

The following passage from the Travels of Marco Polo, who was at the court of the Emperor of China and Tartary about twenty years before that date, shows that a paper currency had been established in that empire. ' The money of the Great Khan,' Marco Polo observes, ' is not made of gold, or ' silver, or other metal; but they take the middle bark from the mulberry tree, and this ' they make firm, and cut into divers round pieces, great and little, and imprint the ' king's mark thereon. Of this paper money, therefore, the emperor causeth an huge ' mass to be made in the City of Cambalu, which suflSceth for the whole empire; and « no man, under pain of death, may coin any other, or spend any other money, or ' refuse it, in all his kingdoms and countries ; nor any, coming from another kingdom, ' dare spend any other money in the empire of the Great Khan. Hence it follows, ' that merchants often coming from remote countries unto the City of Cambalu, bring ' with them gold, silver, pearl, and precious stones, and receive the king's money for ' them: and because this money is not received in their country, they change it again, « in the empire of the Great Khan, for merchandise, which they carry away with them. vol. i. 3 kTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 434 chap . xii. this attempt appears, after an experiment of some years, to have been abandoned: and when a great scarcity of copper induced the Emperor Hongvou to revive* the same scheme, a century after it had been first tried, he entirely failed; the Chinese showing, accord ing to the writer who records the fact, a natural reluctance to exchange their solid metal for so light a substance as paper. The success of any effort to substitute paper currency for coin, must, in the most civilized and settled states, rest wholly on that confidence which those who receive and use it have in the stability, the faith, and the wealth of the government by which it is issued: and every interference of power to promote its circulation must, in a certain degree, depreciate its value. It follows, therefore, that though such a currency may be a convenient medium to facilitate ' He also payeth stipend to his officers and army in the above-mentioned money. ' And lastly, whatever thing he needs in his court, he buyeth with this money. ' Wherefore, there is not a king to be found in the world who exceedeth him in trea- « sur e, not expended on the mint, as elsewhere.' General Kirkpatrick, in a preface to the Translation of the Institutes of Ghazan Khan, published in the New Asiatic Miscellany, describes the history of the bank which Key Khatou attempted to establish in Persia. He adds: « We read in Chinese « history of the establishment of paper currency in that empire, A. D. 1236.' It is certain, that this was from thirty to forty years before the period of which Marco Polo speaks, as he only commenced his travels about the year 1270. His father, Nicolo Polo, and his uncle, Mathio Polo, however, had been at the Court of the Great Khan ofTartary fifteen or sixteen years before this period; and it is not improbable that Marco might have included the substance of their observations in his account of his own travels. And we are particularly informed, that when these were written, both his father and his uncle gave testimony to the truth of all he related. * This second attempt was made A.

There are laws, it is true; but the emperor can make or abrogate these laws at pleasure. Men have a right to a trial, but the monarch names or removes the judges. Filial piety is deemed the first of duties; but all bend to the emperor, as a divine parent. He is called the Son of Heaven; which implies, that he has no duties but to God. He receives adoration from his subjects, and his orders are deemed sacred. The usages, as well as the laws of this empire, are all framed to support the power of the ruler. High officers and nobles, who might, in a country where all the gradations of society are so marked, become dangerous from their official power, are preserved in a state of dependence by continual removals. Their sons are educated at the Imperial College, where the principal lesson taught them is, that of a holy respect for the emperor. In short, all the institutions of this vast empire are studiously designed to remind men of their actual condition, and to make them fear to leave those ranks assigned to them in the community; and this is more effected by the fear of punishment than the hope of reward. The minds of men born in a free country may revolt at this picture of the calm of despotism : but the mass of the inhabitants of those regions of Asia who are exposed to the continual tempests of a barbarous ambition, which recognises no law but the sword, and has no object but conquest, deem the Chinese, on account of their exemption from these evils, the happiest of men; and consider the government, which keeps them in such complete quiet and - subjection, the best that human wisdom has ever invented.43 g THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xii . attended with temporary effect: but, in a kingdom like Persia, w j iere t i ic materials of government have ever been rude and misshapen, where there is always much of natural liberty, of turbulence, and of latent sedition, the very proposition of this plan was calculated to have ruined the most able monarch. We cannot, therefore, be surprised that the indolent and irresolute Key Khatou took alarm at the loud clamours of the inhabitants of his capital, and indeed of the whole kingdom ; for, we are told, all com bined in execrating this scheme, and its authors. But though this singular measure was repealed almost as soon as it was adopted*, the sovereign lost the confidence of all ranks by attempting to enforce it; and, a few months subsequent, the resentment of a personal injury led Baidu Khan, a grandson of Hulakoo, to rebel against his authority; and the unfortunate monarch was, after a short struggle.

Since the death of Hulakoo, the government had been more in state of the the hands of powerful nobles than in those of the monarch. These, in fhltimeofws fact, had become a body of petty princes, and the state was disturbed accession - with their pretensions and usurpations. The regulations established by Chenghiz were neglected; and that superintending authority and strict police, by which alone despotism can be rendered tolerable, from its protecting those over whom it tyrannises from being injured by others, had, in the empire of Persia, no existence, but in name.

These, and a number of other laws, or edicts, which cannot be classed under any general head, were founded upon principles that showed as much attention to the moral improvement of his subjects, as to the increase of the strength and vigour of his government.

His wars with The principal wars which this monarch carried on were with the Espt.''™ of sultans of Egypt. His policy led him to seek the aid of the states of Europe; and Pope Boniface the Eighth endeavoured to excite, by a display of his connexion with Ghazan Khan, the Christian princes to another crusade-f*. It was probably this connexion with the head of the Christian church that led to a general impression among western writers, that Ghazan Khan was not sincere in his conversion to Mahomedanism: and this belief was confirmed by the wars in which he was continually engaged with a race of monarchs who were, at that period, deemed the defenders of the religion of country, owing probably to the confusion in which its government has been for the last century. The post-houses are miserable hovels, at each of which a number of horses are kept. These are given to any person who has an order for them; and the abuses of such a department must be enormous, when not under very strict regulation. * The whole code of his Institutes has been translated from the Persian, by that able orientalist, the late General William Kirkpatrick.— Vide New Asiatic Miscellany. t History of the Crusades, page 408. % The sultans ofTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 439 the prophet of Arabia against the combined efforts of the Christian chap , xir world: but Mahomedan writers are too sensible of the glory of having such a convert, to doubt his sincerity* The fact appears, that the celebrated Ameer Nouroze, whose great influence and talents made his aid essential to Ghazan Khan, informed him, that unless he embraced the religion of Mahomed, it would bJ difficult to place him upon the throne of Persia; and that the Tartar prmce acted like Henry the Fourth of France upon a nearly similar occasion.

Some historians have endeavoured to reconcde us to this ingratitude of Ghazan Khan, by asserting that that prince continued, through life, to hate the man who had forced him to become a convert to a religion which he inwardly abhorred, and which, they say, it was the chief object of the war he waged with the Sultan of Egypt to destroy f- As a proof of this, they adduce his readiness to re-establish the Christians in the Holy Land: but all the promises this monarch made to the Christian potentates, were probably dictated more by motives of policy than of religion. He was engaged in a war in which he required their aid: and he sought it by the common means of holding out those views which he thought most likely to induce them to join him.

This prince, how ever, to obtain the crown, professed the Mahomedan religion; and his life had passed in friendship with Christians, and in wars with the followers of the faith he had adopted. This apparent contra diction of profession and principle must have rendered him unpo pular with almost all classes of his subjects ; for we can hardly believe that Christians could have reposed with confidence in a monarch, over whom political motives had such power as to make him an apostate J; or that Mahomedans could have been attached to a ruler who so openly countenanced and aided their enemies. Nevertheless, Ghazan Khan has the singular fortune of being exalted, by eastern authors, into an example for monarchs; and of being deplored by western writers as one of the greatest losses the cause of religion ever suffered: but the latter sentiment * The Christian monk, Haiton, who was long at the Court of Ghazan Khan, after describing a battle with the Sultan of Egypt in which the Persian monarch displayed the greatest conduct and courage, adds: ' It is astonishing how so many virtues can ' reside in so diminutive and ugly a person.'— D e G uignes. f We are informed by De Guignes, who probably follows a western author, that Ghazan Khan made Cyrus his model, and was constantly reading the life of that prince, and of Alexander; but unless this monarch understood Greek, he must have been contented with the fabulous but animating pages of the Persian poets, Ferdosi and Nizamee, for an account of the actions of these heroes. X It is not distinctly stated whether he apostatized from the religion of his ancestors, or from that of the Christians i but, if we are to credit western writers, we must believe that he was attached, through life, to the latter faith, though he does not appear ever to have made a public profession of his belief in its doctrines.

Mahomed Khodah-bundah was succeeded by his son, Abou Heissucceed- Seyd* who was only twelve years of age when he was raised to the throne. The kingdom was thrown into confusion by the I h .^ disputes of the noblesf. These contended with each other for power during the minority of the young prince: and the Ameer Chouban, who had been intrusted with the management of public affairs during Abou Seyd's minority, had so increased his influence by a marriage with the prince's sister, that his power appeared to be a.d. i 32 o- 22 almost on a level with that of his sovereign. The first event which A,ILm - 23 - occurred to shake the authority of this powerful nobleman, was the rebellion ot his son, Timour Tash, who was Governor of Syria. He, however, hastened with a large army to reduce him to obedience: and the repentant youth, instead of meeting his father in the field, threw himself at his feet, and implored his forgiveness J. Chouban carried him a prisoner to Sultaneah, and left his fate to be decided by Abou Seyd, who was so much pleased with the loyalty of his minister, that he not only pardoned Timour Tash, but restored him to his government. it was constructed, is still preserved: but the whole is dilapidated; and the present king, Futteh Aly Shah, has taken some of the materials to build a small summer-house, where he, resides when his army is encamped (which it usually does a few weeks every season,) in the fine plains of Sultaneah. * He is often called by his title of Behauder Khan. t The principal of these were the Ameer Chouban, chief of the tribe of Seldouz, and Ameer Hussein Kourkhan. J D e Guignes.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 444 chap. xii . Chouban, some time after this occurrence, formed a plan for increasing the power of his family, by marrying his daughter, Bagdad Khatoon*, to the Ameer Hussein, one of the principal chiefs of the Moghulsf. This lady, who was eminent for her beauty, had been seen by Abou Seyd; and the young prince had become deeply enamoured of her charms J. Forgetting the dictates of prudence, he endeavoured to avail himself of a law, or rather usage, among the Moghuls, by which a person is obliged to divorce his wife, if the monarch desires to marry her. Abou Seyd demanded Bagdad Khatoon for his queen ; but neither the father nor husband were disposed to comply with this demand; and they were too strong to be coerced. Chouban, in the hopes that absence would destroy a passion which threatened his family with disgrace and ruin, prevailed upon the king to go to Bagdad; and sent his son-in-law, with his fair bride, in an opposite direction ||.

Mahomed Khan was elevated in 1336 : reigned nearly two years, and was murdered in A. D. 1338. Saukey, the sister of Abou Seyd, was elevated to the throne in A.

Jehan Timour was deposed the same year, and Soliman Khan was declared king: he left the kingdom and went to Dearbehir in 1344. Nousheerwan was elevated in A. D. 1344.

The capital of this family was Shiraz, which is said to have attained its greatest prosperity under their rule.

We learn from the history of the dynasty of Muzuffer, that the power of the descendants of Hulakoo over Fars terminated with the founder of a petty dynasty of rulers, termed Turkoman Kara-Koinloo, or « the ' Turkomans of the black sheep,' from their carrying a figure of that animal in their banners. * This dynasty governed Fars seventy-seven years; during which, seven princes enjoyed power.

The Tartar conqueror, with apparent, if not real displeasure, demanded how the poet came to dispose of his two finest cities, Samar- cund and Bokharah, which, in a beautiful stanza, he had said he would give for the mole on the cheeks of his mistress.

One of Timour's ancestors had been vizier to Chaghtai, the son of Chenghiz; and flattering historians have traced his descent to the same source as that of the Moghul monarch. The common ancestor of both (these authors affirm) was the cele brated BuzunjurJ, who has been already mentioned. * Kesch was the capital of a district of the same name.

A Persian version of this work has been translated into English by Major Davey, an able orientalist, and pub lished, after his death, by Doctor White, professor of the eastern languages at Oxford. The late General Kirkpatrick observes, that the first translation of this work from the Turkish into Persian was made by command of the Emperor of Delhi, Shah Jehan 18 ; and that the Dil-Kusha states, that the copies of the MS. were so rare, that the one which was kept in the family of Timour was handed down, from father to son, as a valuable legacy : and this very volume, he adds, fell into the hands of the Emperor of Constantinople, who suffered many copies to be made from it. The circumstance of this work being translated into Persian in India, accounts for its hardly being known in Persia. The vanity of that nation would reject a work in their own language that contained all the wisdom of Solomon, coming from such a quarter. A very sensible Persian, of the name of Zein-ul-abdeen, assured me that he had seen a copy of the Institutes of Timour in the original Turkish language, in the library of a Persian chief at Herat.

According to the Institutes of that chief, he was at this time appointed to the general government of Maverul-Naher, or Transoxania. || Timour assumes the merit of having, by his presents and intrigues, fomented these divisions among the enemies of his country. vide New Asiatic Miscellany.452 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xiii . completely subdued all the territories between the Jaxartes and the Oxus, he nominated his son, Ouleaus Khajah, to the important charge of maintaining this possession.

Hussein was violent and avari- * Timour's Institutes, page 53.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ cious, and desired to repair the losses he had sustained by extortion chap. xiii. and oppression; while those who were reduced to want by his rapacity, found Timour always ready to give them every relief in his power: and we are informed, that the jewels of his favourite wife*, the sister of Hussein, which had been given by Timour to relieve the distress of some of the principal inhabitants of the country, were actually taken by his sordid brother-in-law in payment of fines that he had imposed upon themf. Occurrences of this nature, aggra vated by a dissimilarity of temper, could not fail of causing dissen sions between these powerful lords. Timour was accused of plotting against the state. He answered the charge, and acquitted himself with honour: but the insult of such an accusation was not to be for gotten ; and the death of Hussein's sister, which happened about this period, seemed to dissolve the only tie by which they were bound. Soon after this event, Timour, on the plea of self-defence, placed a.d .ises. himself at the head of a considerable army. In the contest which A ' H ' 767 ' ensued, he was at first unsuccessful; but his fortunes, when at the lowest, were restored by an enterprise to which the history of the world can hardly furnish a parallel, and which marked, beyond all other events of his life, that union of art, courage, and wisdom, which combined to form the character of this extraordinary man. Among other advantages which Hussein had gained, he had taken the Fort of Ktirshee from Timour; and that chief informs J us, that he deemed his honour pledged to regain this important post : * The name of this lady was Ouruljun Khatoon. + Petit de la Croix's Translation of Sherrif-u-deen. J Timour's Institutes, page 95.456 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xm. but it was impossible to do so by open hostility, for he had only a very small force, and it was defended by a strong garrison, and a body of twelve thousand men were encamped in its vicinity. Timourtates Timour resolved to have recourse to stratagem; and having stratagem^ proceeded to the Oxus, he concealed himself near the banks of that river, and caused a report to be spread that he had fled to Khorassan. This report was credited; and the troops of Hussein became negligent, and thought of nothing but the joys of triumph. When he was satisfied, to use his own words % ' that his enemies ' had spread the carpet of riot and dissipation,' he selected two hundred and forty-three of his bravest followers; and having crossed the Oxus, advanced to the village of Sheerkund, where he remained for twenty-four hours. From thence he made a rapid march on Kurshee; and when within three miles of that fort, he ordered his soldiers to employ themselves in making ladders, while he went forward to reconnoitre with a party of forty men. It was night: and he informs us, that when he observed ' the dark shade ' of the castle, he commanded his warriors to haltfand proceeding with two favourite soldiers (Mubasher and Abdullah J) to the brink of the ditch, which was full, he was enabled to pass over it by the means of a hollow tree, that was laid across it to convey water into the fort. Mubasher had been left with the horses ; Abdullah accom panied Timour, who went first to the gateway and tried to open it, but could not. He next went round the walls, and having marked # Timour's Institutes. t Timour's Institutes, page 97.

Forty-three men were left with the horses. One hundred, conducted by Abdullah, went with ladders, which had been prepared for the purpose, across the hollowed tree to the spot that had been examined by their daring leader, where they scaled the wall; and then proceeding to the gateway, put the guards to death as they lay asleep, and opened the gate to Timour, who had advanced to their aid with another hundred men. The moment the whole were in the city they rushed to the attack of the castle, at the same time sounding their trumpets, and shouting, in order to terrify the garrison, and induce them to believe that the body by which they were attacked was numerous. They completely succeeded; every post was deserted; and Timour allowed many to escape, in the hope that the alarm taken by the troops within might be communicated to the camp, and that he might be relieved, by their flight, from the great force by which he knew himself to be encompassed. But the generals of Ameer Hussein discovered at Ameer Hus- daylight the smallness of that body by which the garrison of Kurshee ll'L To re- had been surprised, and resolved to make every effort to repair the gai ' it ' disgrace which they had sustained. The numbers were so dispro- porlioned, that it appeared impossible for the party who had taken the fort to maintain the conquest they had so gloriously made. But they were all heroes, and they were commanded by Timour. Every attack of the enemy was repulsed; continual sallies were made; and the troops of Hussein, who soon found that their success was doubtful, became divided and discontented. One leader separated his division; and the whole soon commenced a retreat; which they He retreats. vol. i. 3 N45B THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xm. were not able to effect without the loss of a considerable part of their baggage. Timour dwells with just pride on this early event of his life, and declares that it was on this occasion he first discovered ' the incalculable advantage which wisdom has over force, and with « w hat small means the greatest designs may be accomplished* ' This extraordinary success raised the reputation of Timour, and forced his rival to have recourse to every effort that art or violence could suggest to subdue him, but in vain ; and, after a long struggle, mutual convenience, and a sense of the danger to which their country Peace con- was exposed by their discord, led these hostile chiefs to make peace ttetnTimour with each other. We are informed, that Timour gained several HussetT 6 ' victories over his adversary before this reconciliation took place. At the moment one of these actions was commencing, that leader addressed his followers in a speech worthy of the hero of Tartary. ' This day, brave soldiers!' said that prince, ' is a day of dancing ' for warriors! The hall of the dance for heroes is the field of battle! 44 The shouts of war and the sound of trumpets are their songs and &lt;e music! and the wine they drink, is the blood of their enemies!' The peace concluded between Timour and the Ameer Hussein was not sincere, and could not, therefore, be permanent. Another rupture soon occurred, which terminated in the death of the latter. That chief, we are told, when reduced to capitulate in Bulkh, asked only to be permitted to end his days in retirement. This was granted: but even the partial historian-f- of Timour throws but a thin veil over Ameer Hus- the murder of his rival. Ameer Hussein, he pretends, was slain by dered? mur a Tartar lord, whose brother he had put to death; and who, with * Timour's Institutes. f Sherrif-u-deen.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. other nobles, were aware of the necessity of such a proceeding, to chap. xiii. save the state from the dangers to which it would be exposed by the unwise clemency of their leader : but it is evident that that prince approved, if he did not command, an act, which made him the sovereign of his country. Timour was occupied eleven years, after his elevation to the supreme power of Transoxania, in settling his own kingdom, and in conquering Kashgar and Khaurizm. After these objects were Timour con- . . . t* it quers Kashgar effected, he determined on the invasion of Khorassan.

After this massacre the gates were shut, to prevent immediate assault: but defence was impossible: and the rage of Timour, on hearing of the fate of his soldiers, exceeded all bounds. He would listen to no terms of capitulation; and the warmth of indignation was increased by the cold dictates of policy. He was commencing his career of conquest; and Isfahan was doomed to be an example to the other cities of the earth.

But the gallant prince was not supported.

' Shah Munsoor,' he observes, ' advanced at their head like a furious lion, and in ' opposition to his reason, which should have preserved in his mind a suitable idea of ' the person he had to do with, as one whose arm had cast down all his enemies : on a « Friday, at the hour of prayer, he attacked our main body, composed of thirty thou- « sand Turks, the most dexterous men of their time, in a place named Patila: he over- « threw their squadrons, broke their ranks, made his way into the midst of them, and ' gained, behind our army, posts of the utmost consequence; then he returned, furious ' as a dragon, to the fight, seeming resolved to lose his life. Timour stopt short with ' some of his favourites, to consider the extreme vigour, or rather rashness, of this ' prince, who dared to attack him in person. Timour seeing him come directly ' against him, would have armed himself with his lance to oppose him ; but he could ' not find it, because Poulad Tchoura, the keeper of it, had been so briskly attacked, ' that he fled, and carried away the lance. Timour, who had only fourteen or fifteen ' persons with him, did not stir out of his place till Shah Munsoor came up to him.

But this corps was soon put to the route, and the conqueror took possession of Shiraz. All the princes of the race of Muzuffer sub mitted, and were put to death.

According to some authors, it was first built by Alexander the Great; while others ascribe its foun dation to the monarchs of the Sassanian dynasty. It was, when Timour attacked it, held by a, notorious chief, or rather robber, of the name of Hussun, whose depredations on the surrounding country made him an object of universal terror. He expected no mercy, and therefore defended his fort with a valour and despair, that nothing but the courage and numbers of the Tartars could have over- a.d.1593. come. The Mahomedan historian* who details the events of this A ' H ' 796 ' celebrated siege, gives a description, which though perhaps imperfect, is still curious, as it affords us a general idea of the mode in which the Tartars attacked fortified places. Mode in Timour first (according to this author) drew up his army; and directed the drums to beat, and the war shout to be given: they Tukreet • next surrounded the fort, and proceeding by sap, began to under mine the outworks, while battering-rams, and machines that threw large stones, were fixed near the walls, to destroy the dwellings of the besieged. The emperor had ordered his tents to be pitched close to the lines of attack, that he might better encourage his soldiers, whom he commanded to carry the place at any loss. The walls of the fort appeared impregnable: they were either formed of immense and lofty rocks, or of masonry betwixt them, that in height, depth, and solidity, seemed equal to the vast masses of stone which they connected. The Tartars, we are informed, soon worked their way under cover to the foot of the walls; and one of their leaders made a fortunate attack upon a * Sherrif-u-deen.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 467 tower, the possession of which forced the garrison to abandon all chap. xiii. their outworks, and to retreat to the body of the fortress; a general attack on which was immediately ordered: and the engineers, we are informed, marked by ' red furrows' the space allotted for each division, and gave its commander written orders how to proceed in undermining the fortifications*. The regiments of the left wing of the army, which were the most distinguished, had their share of attack first allotted. These regiments composed the tomaunf, or division of Kepeck Khan, and were commanded by Arslan. They worked in files, and were followed by the tomaun of the prince.

The Tar tars rushed through the ruins to the storm, and advanced to the very centre of the place, but they were every where bravely opposed. The besiegers (the historian observes) fought for glory, the besieged for life*. The assailants appear to have met with a momentary check ; and orders were given by Timour, that those parts of the walls which were yet left should be undermined. The bastion, where the tomauns of Allahdad and Amancha were labouring, was destroyed to the very foundation, and Hussun was obliged to retreat with his remaining ' siegers employ a number of men to. excavate the earth, with great labour, in the ' same manner that the Bessi dig for veins of gold and silver. Thus, by sinking a ' cavern, an infernal or subterraneous road is opened for the destruction of the city: ' and the dark insidious plan may be carried into effect in two ways. Sometimes a ' party of the besiegers, issuing out of their mine by night into the heart of the city, ' without being observed by the inhabitants, burst open the gates, introduce their ' fellow soldiers from without, and slaughter the unguarded citizens in their houses. ' Sometimes, on reaching the foundations of the place, they undermine the greatest ' part of them, removing the earth from below, and then place temporary props of dry ' timber to support the walls, and fill the space with a great quantity of fire-wood, ' and other combustibles. This being done, the warriors are drawn up in readiness for ' the attack. The wood under the foundation is kindled. As soon as the props and ' planks are consumed, the walls fall down, and the place lies open to assault.' We learn from Herodotus, that the art of mining was understood by the ancient Persians in the reign of Darius : and Folard, in his Translation of Polybius, conjectures that the Greeks borrowed their knowledge of this branch of military science from the eastern nations.

The Tartar army had taken upwards of one Zgte 'd. 1 ' hundred thousand Indians prisoners before thej reached Delhi; when the siege of that city was resolved upon, their leader judged that the operation might be embarrassed from the number of the captives; an order was issued for their slaughter; and terrible vengeance was * Timour informs us, that the army with which he invaded India consisted of ninety-two thousand horsemen; and the affinity of this number to the names given to the Prophet Mahomed, was deemed a happy omen of success.— T imour's Insti tutes, page 135. f In the spring of the year in which he invaded India, Timour made an irruption into the country of the Sia Posh, or ' men with black garments;' a singular tribe, who, living in a strong country, amid the mountains of Budukshan, had long main tained their independence. Their fastnesses were forced by Timour's soldiers, and they were compelled to submit; promising, at the same time, to embrace the Maho- medan religion. They, however, soon afterwards rose upon the Tartars appointed to guard them, put nearly a thousand of them to the sword, and regained their mountains, Timour again attacked them, and was victorious. He, on this occasion, (we are in formed by his historian,) followed a precept of Mahomed. ' The women were spared, hut ' all male idolaters were put to death!' The Sia Posh were, however, neither extermi nated nor conquered, and they are to this day an independent race, with peculiar manners, language, and religion. They are in a state of continual warfare with their neighbours, and are the terror of all the Mahomedans in their vicinity. — E lphin- stone's MSS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. xiii . denounced against any person who should attempt to evade the bloody mandate*. It is believed that not one of them escaped death. The history of mankind cannot furnish another example of so horrid an act of deliberate cruelty: yet the being by whom it was perpe trated has been exalted by historians and poets into a demi-god: and several of these, not contented with ascribing to him that valour, policy, and martial skill, which he undoubtedly possessed, have extolled him for his numberless virtues; and, above all, for his justice and clemency ! 1399.

All the plain country appears to have submitted to his authority. We are told by Dow, on the authority of Ferishta, that the Fort of Meerut was taken by mines: and he adds, that when they were sprung, they blew the walls and bastions to pieces. This description seems to imply explosion produced by gunpowder, which was not invented (at least not for any military purpose,) in the time of Timour. In whatever mode he took this city, his usage of its garrison was stillTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ after his great labours: but the bad government of his son, Meeran chap. xiii. Shah*, in Persia, had led many chiefs, who had been deposed, to attempt the recovery of their territories. Among these was Ahmed ^6^ Eel-Khannee, who succeeded in repossessing himself of Bagdad. TeZZ™ The ruler of Georgia had also rebelled. Timour was compelled to Timoursub- march into that province, and a season was spent before he could dueS them ' again reduce it to subjection. Bagdad was attacked and recon quered, and a number of the inhabitants put to death, as a punish ment for their having revolted. About the period of these events, Timour meditated a greater Prepares for conquest. He proposed to make himself master not only of Syria of Turkly! 1011 and Egypt, but of all that country which is now distinguished by the name of Turkey. A tribe of Tartars, called Turks, had followed the fortunes of the Seljookee sultans of Iconium. In the confusion which attended the decline of that dynasty, Othman, the chief of this tribe, proclaimed himself independent, and fixed his residence at a town called Yengi-Shaher, or ' the new city,' situated in the vicinity of Bursa. The descendants of this chief had risen rapidly into power upon the ruins of the broken empire of Constantinople: and that imperial city was threatened with imme diate destruction by Bayezeed, (the Bajazet of European histo- Bayezeed rians,) at the very moment when Timour's invasion of Asia Minor ScUfCon- called the Emperor of the Turks to defend his own dominions, stantmople - instead of attacking those of others. Bayezeed was the fourth more cruel than that of Tukreet.

His character was that of a capricious and cruel Character of , • i i Bayezeed. monarch i but he had displayed great fortitude under some seiious reverses: and the rapidity with which he had often led his armies from one extreme of his kingdom to the other, had obtained him the name of Ul-Dirrim, or ' the ligbtning.' The warf which took place between this prince and Timour, terminated in an action that a. d. 1402. was fought near Angora in Asia Minor; the result of which was the ximoM gains complete triumph of the Moghuls. The Turks are represented as abattkW having been wasted by fatigue J and thirst before they commenced the action; and the courage of their leader appears only to have shone forth when the battle was lost. He did not descend from an eminence, where he had gone to view the engagement, till his troops were thrown into irretrievable confusion. His despair then Bayezeed is overcame his reason ; he threw himself amidst his enemies; and, made prisoner a dis p lay of use i ess valour, was made prisoner and carried to the tents of his conqueror, who, according to Persian authors, received him with great kindness, assigned him suitable accommo dations, and continued H to treat him with distinction as long as he and dies, lived, which was little more than a year.

The defeat of Bayezeed * This account of the conduct of Timour to his royal captive is taken from the page of his flattering historian, Sherrif-u-deen : but the following passage from the works of Sir William Jones shows, that a very different account was given by a cotemporary historian of the conduct of Timour on this remarkable occasion. « There are,' that writer observes, « two celebrated histories of the Life of Tamerlane; one in Persian, ' the other in Arabic; both of them written with all the pomp and elegance of the ' Asiatic style. In the first, the Tartarian conqueror is represented as a liberal, bene- « volent, and illustrious prince: in the second, as deformed and impious; of a low ' birth, and detestable principles. It seems difficult at first to reconcile this contra- ' diction; but the difficulty vanishes, when we learn, that great part of the Persian his- ' tory was composed under the inspection of Tamerlane himself, and received only the ' polish of language from the pen of Ali Yezdi, (Sherrif-u-deen); and that the Arabian ' author bore the most inveterate hatred against that monarch. The story of the iron ' cage, in which Tamerlane confined Bajazed, is generally treated as a fable upon the ' authority of the very learned M. D'Herbelot, who asserts, that it is not mentioned ' hy the Arabian historian, though he omits no opportunity of debasing the moral ' character of his hero. This argument would, perhaps, be decisive, if it were founded upon true premises; but unfortunately, in the thirteenth line of the two hundred ' and sixty-eighth page, the Arabian expressly affirms, that Tamerlane did enclose his ' captive, Ilderim Bajazed, in a cage of iron, in order to retaliate the insult offered to the ' Persians hy a sovereign of the Lower Asia, who had treated Shapor, King of Persia, in ' the same manner; that he intended to carry him in this confinement into Tartary, but ' that the miserable prince died in Syria, at a place called Akshehr. This fact,' Sir William Jones adds, ' is not the more true for being asserted by Ebn Arabshah; but ' it seems strange, that the judicious M. D'Herbelot should have overlooked this ' passage, and should-speak so positively of a book which he had read with so little ' attention: nor is the point itself of any great consequence; but it may show how ' cautious we should be in relying upon the authority of illustrious names.'— Sir William Jones's Works, Vol. V. page 547.476 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xiii . was followed by the fall of his dominions ; and the authority of Timour, which had been before recognised over Syria and Egypt, thority^ 3 esta- was now established on the shores of the Mediterranean, and on the shores' 1 of the banks of the Bosphorus.

We may form some judg ment of the comparative superiority of the Moghuls over the Turks in the art of war, by their having taken this city* in fifteen days, which, with the same means of defence, had resisted the attack of Bayezeed for seven years. After these successes f, Timour was occupied for a short time in settling his vast dominions. When this labour was accomplished, his passion for conquest (which, like other desires of the human heart, seems to increase by indulgence,) led him to call a general assembly J * Sherrif-u-deen Aly gives a very minute account of this siege, in which Timour not only employed such mines as have been described, but every kind of known engine of attack: the besieged, he admits, showed the greatest valour, but they were overcome by the superior numbers of the Tartars, and, except a few, who swam to their vessels, were all slaughtered. f Timour, after his return from Syria, removed a great number of Turkish tribes, who had settled in that country, back to Transoxania, and to the plains of Persia. X We find that Timour frequently called these Coroultais, or « general diets' of the ameers, or nobles, before he undertook any great enterprise: and he appears to have always'addressed them in a speech calculated to obtain their cordial assent; and, through them, to animate the zeal and courage of their followers. From the remotest periods to the present day, the power of the great monarchs of Tartary has been sup ported and controlled by these assemblies of ameers, or barons.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ of all the Tartar chiefs; and these must have been a little astonished chap . xnr. to hear their monarch (who was, at this period, seventj-one years , . . a. d. 1404. of age,) propose, as his next enterprise, the invasion of the king- a.h.so?. dom of China.

Remarks Almost all eastern authors, who have written the History of Timour, have lavished praises upon the memory of that monarch. They have blazoned his courage, his talents, and his virtues, and tried to veil, or to excuse, when they could not hide, his deepest crimes. One of the most celebrated of these, whose regard to truth has made him record all the dreadful massacres perpetrated by his hero, though he confesses that Timour had some sins to answer for, tells us he is nevertheless assured that they were all forgiven before he died, and that his soul passed ' from its « terrestrial mansion of pride, to the heavenly paradise of « eternal delights.' We have, however, one exception to this host of flatterers. An Arabian author + has written the Life of Timour with all the virulence of an enemy, and has given us a very opposite picture from what we read in the page of Persian historians of the character and actions of that prince. The following description, in which this writer introduces the Genius of Winter as threatening, with retributive vengeance, the * He moved on this celebrated expedition on Wednesday, the twelfth Rujub, A.

They were « given over to the fury of the tempest. The Genius of the ' Storm entered his assembly, and was heard to exclaim, in « a voice of thunder, 4 Stop thy rapid career, thou unjust tyrant! How long dost thou mean to carry flames over an ' unhappy world ? If thou art a spirit of hell, so am I; we « are both old, and our occupation is the same,—that of subju- « gating slaves : and most baneful is the effect of pestilential « stars* when they meet in terrible conjunction. But proceed ' to extirpate mankind, and render earth cold! Yet thou wilt ' find at last that my blasts are colder than thine. If thou canst ' boast of countless bands, who, faithful to thy orders, harass and ' destroy; know, that my wintry days are, with God's aid, destroyers « also! and, by the Almighty that liveth, I will abate thee nothing! ' Thou shalt be overwhelmed with my vengeance! and all the fire thou hast shall not save thee from the cold death of the icy ' tempestf!' But we must neither form our opinion of the cha racter of this extraordinary man from the eulogiums of his flatterers, nor from the detractions of his enemies: to understand that fully, we must refer to the actions of his life. * The conjunction of Saturn and Mars, always baneful, is here likened to Timour and Winter united to spread desolation. t This fine passage in Ahmed-ben-Arabshah has been translated into Latin by Sir William Jones.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 4oU chap . xin. The Ameer Timour* (for he never assumed the title of khan) was of a good stature-f-, had a fair complexion, an open countenance, and a strong shrill voice. He was much maimed, and lame on the right side ; a circumstance from which (as has before been stated« he derives the name of Tamerlane. The character of this prince merits great attention; for no human being ever possessed qualities so well calculated to attain success in the dangerous path of ambition. Born the chief of a Tartar tribe, he inherited valour: but it was in the vicissitudes of his yonth, and amid the distractions of his native country, that he obtained an experience, which taught him to trust more to policy than to force; to hesitate at no means that could accomplish his end; to brave the danger which he could not avert; and, above all, to dive into the secret springs of other men's actions; and, from that knowledge, to render all • He latterly took the title of solum, aod his flatterers styled him Saheb Keran, or « lord of the great conjunctions' (of the stars). He was also distingnished by his family name of Gnrgan, which hoth De Gnignes and D'Herbelot, by a strange mistake, term Kur Khan; and which, the latter tells us, means ' allied to kings.' This mistake is evident, from the spelling of this word in every Persian history. + In a history which an abbot of the name of Jean-Du-bec gives of Timour, and which he states, is taken from the Arabian historian, A1 Hacin, wc are told, that this monarch had such divine beauty in his eyes, that their lustre was oppressive to beholders. His visage, the same author says, was fair, and his body well proportioned : he had but little hair on his ehin. But the good abbot informs ns, that Timour, contrary to the usage of his country, never cut or shaved the hair of his head, which « was curled aud ' long, and of a beauteous dusky brown or violet colour.' He adds, that the reason which the conqueror gave for this practice was, ' ' race of Samon, requested him alway to -P ukchas's Pilgrims, Vol. III. page 141. t Vide page 449.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 481 around him subservient to his own advancement. We find it chap xnr difficult to pronounce whether this wonderful man had most art or courage, or by whicli of these qualities he subdued the greatest number of his enemies. In the community to which Timour belonged, every thing could be effected by a chief, to whom his own tribe were inviolably attached, and who was popular with the soldiers of his army. To gain these was the great, the constant object of his life. He studied their charac ters, flattered their vanity, fed their avarice, generously rewarded their valour; and, above all, he was patient of their discontent, and ready to pardon even their crimes. His example also must have had a powerful effect on such a race of men. The early deeds of Timour were the tales with which the Tartar mother amused the son she desired to be a hero. Nor did his increased years and greatness prevent his exposing his person in the day of battle. ' When I clothed myself in the robe of empire,' Timour himself observes, ' I shut my eyes to safety, and to the •' repose which is found on the bed of ease*.' From the age of twenty to that of seventy-one, (a period of more than half a century,) scarcely a day of this conqueror's life was passed without action or danger; and his experience as a soldier was, perhaps, as great as that of any man that ever lived. Timour naturally valued himself upon those qualities in which he excelled, and he considered other men as useful only as they were good warriors. To all such he was the best of monarchs. ' I ordained,' Timour states, ' that the right of the warrior should not be injured; vol. i. * Timour's Institutes. 3 qTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 482 chap . xm. ' and that the soldier who had grown in years should not be ' deprived of his station or his wages ; and that the actions of the ' soldier should not be suppressed: for those men,' he adds, ' who ' sell their permanent happiness for perishable honour, merit com- ' pensation, and are worthy of reward and encouragement*. There was no feature more remarkable in the character of Timour than his extraordinary perseverance. No difficulties ever led him to recede from what he had once undertaken : and he often persisted in his efforts under circumstances that led all around him to despair. He used, on such occasions, to relate to his friends an anecdote of his early life. ' I once,' said he, - was forced to take ' shelter from my enemies in a ruined building, where I sat alone « many hours. Desiring to divert my mind from my hopeless con- ' dition, I fixed my observation on an ant that was carrying a grain « of corn larger than itself up a high wall. I numbered the efforts ' it made to accomplish this object. The grain fell sixty-nine times « to the ground ; but the insect persevered, and the seventieth time ' it reached the top of the wall. This sight,' said Timour, ' gave ' me courage at the moment; and I have never forgot the lesson it ' conveyed •f.' Such a leader as Timour must have been idolized by his soldiers, and with an army of six or seven hundred thousand men attached to his person, he was careless of the opinion of other classes in the com munity.. The object of this monarch was fame as a conqueror; and a noble city was laid in ashes, or the inhabitants of a province mas sacred, on a cold calculation that a dreadful impression would be # Timour's Institutes. f Persian Manuscript.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 483 made, which would facilitate the purposes of his ambition. He pre- chap, xiii, tended to be very religious, was rigid in performing his sacred duties, and paid attention to pious men; who, in return for his favour, used to assure him that God had given the countries of other monarchs to his victorious sword. The parade which he made of these pro phecies, proves that he either believed in them, or that he thought they might produce an effect favourable to his designs. Timour, we are informed by his son. Shah Rokh*, introduced the holy law of Mahomed into his dominions, and abolished the pre cepts of Chenghiz Khan. He, however, appears to have made very few material alterations in the military regulations of that great sove reign. We are in possession of the Institutes, or rather Memoirs, which this prince wrote, and in which he mixes an account of the principal actions of his life with rules for the administration of the vast regions which he had subdued. It is amusing to read the liberal and wise sentiments contained in the general maxims of government which Timour asserts that he established; but one fact will satisfy us what must have been the result of his actual system. The Tartar leader of the tomaun, the commanders of a thousand, of a hundred, and of ten, were the officers of justice, and of revenue, in the con quered territories. These men of blood, in whom martial skill and courage were all the qualities which their leader ever required, must have been ill-chosen instruments-f for restoring a country to pro- * Letter from Shah Rokh to the Emperor of China.— Asiatic Miscellany, Vol. I. page 89. t Timour in his Institutes informs us, that, in order to keep those officers whom he nominated to great charges suspended between hope and fear, he appointed to each station another person, whom he denominates a Kotul, or ' successor.' The484 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xiii . sperity: but they did what was desired; they continued, by their dreadful cruelties, that impression which the arms of the conqueror had first made, and, by suppressing rebellion, left their monarch at liberty to pursue his conquests in some other quarter of the world. From what has been said, we may pronounce that Timour, though one of the greatest of warriors, was one of the worst of monarchs. He was able, brave, and generous; but ambitious, cruel, and oppressive. He considered the happiness of every human being as a feather in the scale, when weighed against the advancement of what he deemed his personal glory; and that appears to have been measured by the number of kingdoms which he laid waste, and the people that he destroyed. The vast fabric of his power had no foundation, it was upheld by his individual fame; and the moment that he died, his empire dis solved. Some fragments of it were seized by his children: but it was in India alone that they retained dominion for any length of time. In that country we yet perceive a faint and expiring trace of the former splendour of the Moghul dynasty: a pageant, learned editor of the Translation of his Institutes remarks, that « by this artful policy, ' he not only secured his authority over the provinces which he divided among his « Ameers, by placing a spy (for such was the Kotul) over the conduct of each of them, ' but made every province answer the purpose of satisfying two instead of one of his « Ameers 4 9.' It is difficult to understand how a policy could succeed, that proclaimed suspicion at the moment it gave charge; or how both parties could have been satisfied where their interests were opposed, and the prosperity of one at variance with the success of the other. 29 Timour's Institutes, page 76.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 4oo supported by the British nation, still sits upon a throne at Delhi; chap . xm. and we view in him the gradual decline of human greatness, and wonder at the state to which a few centuries have reduced the lineal descendants of the great Timour. Timour had bequeathed his crown to his grandson, Peer Mahomed; but that prince was at Candahar when his father died: and Khulleel Sultan, (another grandson,) who was present with the army, obtained the support of several powerful chiefs, and the possession of Samarcund, the capital of the empire. A contest took place between these princes, which terminated unfavourably for Peer Mahomed, who was soon afterwards put to death by the Peer Maho- treachery of his own minister*.

Never was the vanity of ambition more strikingly exemplified. The vast treasures which Timour had amassed by the conquest of nearly half the world, were squandered at the will of a courtesan, whose extravagance was boundless. But this scene could not last. The chiefs who had raised Khulleel to the throne, were scandalized at a proceeding which they deemed degrading to the character of the successor of the great Timour; and their discontents were aggra- * De Guignes. -f- This name signifies ' the joy or delight of the country.'

She was, we are informed, led in chains through the streets of Samarcund, and had to sustain the insults and outrages of an irritated populace, who not only ascribed to her many of the oppressions they had suffered, during the reign of Khulleel, but viewed her, as she really was, the cause of all the misfortunes of that unhappy prince. Sultan Shah Rokh, the uncle of Khulleel Sultan, marched from Khorassan the moment he heard of the misfortunes of his nephew.

He chap. xiii. held the government of Khorassan at his father's death, and appears to have declined entering into any contest for the Crown of Tartary. When, however, his nephew was expelled, he marched, as has been Rok' Shah before stated, and made himself master of the empire. He was a brave and generous, but not an ambitious prince: and, during a reign of thirty-eight years, we hear of no wars in which he was engaged, except with the Turkoman tribes of Asia Minor, whose power Timour had overcome, but not destroyed; and who had, since the death of that monarch, recovered their possessions, and extended their dominions over Aderbijan. Shah Rokh, whose courage, we are told by eastern historians, was equal to his virtue, defeated Kara Yusoof in three great battles: and, after the death of that Turkoman prince, he was still more successful in a war in which he was engaged with his sons, Jehan Shah and Secunder; the former of whom was reduced to the condition of a tributary Governor of Aderbijan, and the latter became a fugitive from his country. But Shah Rokh inherited no passion for conquest. Imitating the virtuous son* of Chenghiz, he desired not to extend, but to repair, the ravages committed by his father. He rebuilt the walls of the cities of Herat and Merv, and restored almost every town and province in his dominions to prosperity. This prince also encouraged men of science and learning: and his court was very splendid. He cultivated the friendship of cotemporary monarchs; and we read in the page of his historian-j- a very curious account of some embassies which passed between him and the Emperor of China.]:. * Octai: vide page 420. f Khondemir.

Sultan Shah Rokh died at the age of seventy-one: he was sue- ceeded by his son, Ulugh Beg; a prince who had made peaceful STc'S studies* the chief object of his life, and had entirely neglected the art b I 6 'd.im6. of war; a science more important than all others to a person in his A ' H ' 8M ' condition.

It is a consolation to a. h . ass. k n p W that this unnatural prince enjoyed the power he had attained, by so monstrous a crime, only for the short period of six months; he was slain by his own soldiers. After the death of Ulugh Beg we discover a crowd of the descendants of Timonr contending for the provinces of his empire : and so great was the respect which men entertained for the blood of the hero, that every one who could boast of it in his veins, found adherents who enabled him either to obtain a throne, or Baber obtains au honourable grave.

XIII. was equally unfortunate. That prince, after some vicissitudes, was defeated and made prisoner by Uzun Hussun, who put him, and all his family and relations, to death. This cruelty is com mended by many historians, who assert, that it was necessary, to avenge the honour of his family. Secunder, the son of Kara Yusoof, when he fled from Shah Rokh, had, by accident, made Kfii-a Osman, the grandfather of Uzun Hussun, prisoner. He con- c au se of Ae fined him at Erzeroora, where he died; and Secunder had the har- ^.STof barity, when he afterwards visited that place, to dig up the body of bis enemy, that he might strike the head off and send it in triumph 'o! 0m t0 the Sultan of Egypt. This horrid and brutal outrage produced an irreconcileable feud between the two tribes: and the extirpation of all the relations and descendants of Secunder was considered an inadequate revenge for his base and insulting treatment of the remains of Osman.

The dynasty its founder, which Uzun Hussun founded, is sometimes termed Bayenderee, from the name of a person to whom they trace their descent.

The latter prince, after he had extir- chap. xiii. pated his rivals, engaged in a war with Sultan Abou Sejd. He is said to have owed his triumph over a very superior force more to his skill sun's war with and activity, than to his courage. We are told by his historians, AbouSeyd ' that he avoided close action, but continually harassed his enemies by a species of warfare which is termed Kossackeef, or ' resem bling the Koss^cks.' In other words, the war was carried on against their supplies. His success was complete : the army of the sultan a. d. 1468. a ii 873 was reduced to such distress by these predatory attacks, that they were literally forced to disperse without fighting a battle; and in that hurry and confusion, which always attends the flight of an irregular body of men, their monarch fell into the hands of Uzun Hussun, who, from that event, became sovereign of a great part of the dominions of the House of Timour J. Uzun Hussun, after he had made himself master of Persia, turned bis arms in the direction of Turkey: but his career of greatness was arrested by the superior genius of the Turkish Emperor, Mahomed the Second, from whom he suffered a signal defeat, which terminated his schemes of ambition. He died, after a reign of eleven years, DeathofUzun at the age of seventy.

From the death of Uzun Hussun till the elevation of Shah Ismail Suffaveah, a period of twenty-six years, there are few events worthy of notice. The sons, grandsons, and nephews, of Hussun, contended with each other for his territories; and, by their dissen sions, not only accelerated their own ruin, but prepared the way for a dynasty of a very different character to any that had yet governed Persia. The inhabitants of that country, wearied of the continual wars carried on by chiefs of military tribes, (who to the common motives of hostility often added those of family feuds,) saw with delight a race of monarchs rising into power, who appeared likely, from their origin and habits, to be exempt from many of those feelings which, by their tendency to perpetuate discord, had made a nation despair of ever again obtaining the first of all bless ings,—internal peace.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 495 CHAPTER XIV.

It has been a suhjeet of contto- versy, whether the name of Suffee, as applied to this person, was a proper name, or meant to designate his religious character as a Sooffee. It might have been either: both Suffee and Sooffee have the same root, Sufa, which means « clean, pure:' and as it is a point that, from this very circumstance, never can be settled, it does not merit discussion. There is no doubt that Shaikh Suffee-u-deen was a Sooffee, or « philoso- « phical devotee:» but his being named as he was, is not essential to establish this fact. t He is often ealled Saltan Sndder-n-deen. The latter name means the pre- « eminent of the faith.' tThe author of the Zuhd-uI-Tnarikh observes, « That when Shaikh Snifee died, ii Sudder-n-deen succeeded. The temporal rulers of the age (he adds,) paid their 'respects to this holy man. Among those was the Ameer Timour, who bade Sadder- ' u-deen demand a favour of him. The saint required that he would release the pri- « soners he had brought from Room (Turkey). Timour complied with his desires.'

History does not furnish us with a better motive for obedience, or a nobler origin of power. Khaujah Aly, after visiting Mecca, went on a pilgrimage to a,,. Jerusalem.

The legacy of the mantle is in fact the mode by which these holy men transfer their empire over the minds of their disciples, to their successors. Their power is grounded upon their sacred character; and that rests upon their poverty and contempt of worldly goods. Their mantle is in general their all; and its transfer, therefore, marks their heir. Some of these mantles can be traced several centuries, and their value increases with their age. They become relics, which are almost worshipped; and their envied possessor has many disciples and followers, who venerate the tattered and patched garment much more than the person who wears it. | The father of Juneyd was Shaikh Ibrahim; but little is said of him, except thaj: he was a pious man. vol. i. 3 s498 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xiv, numbers, and banished him from Ardebil.

His son. Sultan Hyderf, succeeded him.

His family were kings to power o{ , to none . and wel . e regarded by almost all his subjects with sentiments of religious reverence and veneration. The most celebrated of his ancestors were Sooffees; and had, no doubt, held all the opinions and tenets of that sect of philosophical deists; but it was necessary that the holy raptures in which they indulged should have an object more comprehensible to the mass of their adherents than the Divinity. That which they chose was their ancestor Aly, the companion, nephew, and son-in-law of the prophet. In the history of Aly, as represented by the Persians, there was something peculiarly calculated to interest the best feelings of human nature. We can suppose that his followers contemplated, with an admiration that bordered on devotion, a youth of fourteen becoming the first convert of the prophet; displaying, throughout his life, an unshaken constancy in the opinions he had so early adopted; inferior to none in zeal, and superior to all in courage;THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. cherished by his uncle, who bestowed upon him his favourite daughter, and destined him for his successor : yet, after all, deprived for a period of an inheritance, which seemed, on everv ground, his right; but, nevertheless, submitting patiently to the wrongs he sustained from the elevation of the three first suc cessors of the prophet, Aboubeker, Omar, and Osman, rather than draw that sword, which was the terror of infidels, against true believers,, who, however misled, were still followers of the faith he loved. Though Aly ultimately attained the caliphate, he enjoyed that dignity but a short period. His desire to prevent contentions among the ' faithful,' made him submit his claims to the decision of an artful enemy, and he was defrauded of power before he fell under the dagger of an assassin. The injuries which he sustained had produced early divisions among the Mahomedans; and these were increased by the misfortunes that attended his son, Hussein, who, deceived by the promises of his adherents into an attempt to gain dominion, perished miserably on the sandy plains of Kerbelah; while his brother Hussun was doomed to the more cruel fate of being poisoned by a wife he loved, who was led, by her avarice and ambition, to become the instrument of his implacable enemies. From the time these events occurred, there had always been a sect, who, upholding the rights of Aly and his children, addressed them in their prayers, and vented secret curses on those by whom they had been oppressed. But the great power of the Soonee, or ' orthodox Mahomedans/' had repressed these secta ries, who had been often visited by the most cruel persecutions. The ancestors of Shah Ismail had instructed their adherents inTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 502 CHAP. XIV. the tenets of this sect. Aly was the sacred name on which they continually called. His wrongs were the objeet of their inmost thoughts; and that hatred which an indulgence in these senti ments excited against his enemies, was, by an easy and natural transition, transferred to those who continued to respect and reverence names which they abhorred. It was in his active and invincible hatred to all Soonees, that is to all persons who believed in the superior right of the three caliphs who preceded Aly, that the disciple of the family of Suffee recognised himself as a zealous follower of the new faith he had adopted; and the very name of Sheah, which signifies « a sectary,' and which his enemies had given as a reproach, was changed into a title, in which he gloried, and by which he deemed himself pledged to eternal hostility against the adherents of the enemies of Aly. No feeling could be more cal culated to promote the greatness of Persia as an independent kingr dom. It was a flame which spread to every bosom; and, as a powerful motive of action, was, while the fervour continued, perhaps fully equal in its force to that noble spirit of patriotism, which can alone be known in nations who enjoy the invaluable blessings of a free and just government. Ismail took full advantage of the enthusiasm of his disciples, to cherish feelings so essential for the political greatness of the empire he governed. The seven Turkish tribes*, who had been * The names of these tribes were the Oosiijaloo, the Slmmloo. the Nikalloo, the BSiharloo, the ZWkudder, the Kujur, and the AffMr. Each of these, (aeeording to the Persian manuscript from which I have taken their names,) had seven subordinate tribes under them; but this probably refers not to eels, or tribes, but subordinate teerahs, or branches.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 503 the chief promoters of his glory and success, were distinguished by chap. xiv. a particular dress: they wore a red cap, from which they received the Turkish name of KAzel-bash, or ' golden heads,' which has descended to their posterity. The swords of these tribes were con secrated, by these distinctions, to the defence of the Sheah religion; and a sense of that obligation has survived the existence of the family by whom it was first created. It would be tedious to enter into a minute detail of the actions of Ismail. He was occupied, for some years after he ascended the throne, in subjugating those provinces of Persia which continued to Conquests made by Shah resist his authority. When that object was accomplished, he attacked Ismail. , , , . ,. , . a. d. 1508. and took Bagdad and its surrounding territories. In the year succeed- a. h. 914. ing that on which he made this conquest, he encountered the Usbegs in Khorassan, defeated them, and slew their chief, Shahibeg Khan ; and this victory gave him complete possession of that large and valuable province. He next proceeded to Bulkh, which he also subdued; and then returned to the City of Koom. He had enjoyed but a short repose when he was called to the defence of a. d. 1511. Khorassan, which was again invaded by the Usbegs; who, how- Defeats the ever, were once more defeated : and Ismail, by leaving some of his Usbess ' bravest troops in that quarter of his dominions, provided, in the best manner he was able, against their future predatory attacks*. To this period Ismail was successful, but he had now to encounter a. d. 1514. a powerful enemy. Sultan Selimf advanced from Constantinople * Zubd-ul-Tuarikh. t According to the Turkish historians, Selim proclaimed his expedition against Ismail a religious war; and the royal saint of Persia is often termed, in their page, ;ShytS.n-Kooli, or ' the slave of the devil.' The Chevalier D'Ohsson has, in his learned work upon the Mahomedan religion*504 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xiv. towards Persia, at the head of a numerous and well-appointed army. ac tion took place on the frontiers of Aderbijan, in which the Sultan Selim ^ i rv marches to in- Persian monarch suffered a complete defeat. Among other ofncers and defeats of rank, Meer Syud Sheriff, the Sudder-ul-Suddoor*, or chief pontiff of the kingdom, was slain. Ismail, who had contemplated victory, in this contest, as the consummation of his glory, tried all that the most desperate valour could effect to obtain that object. We are told by Persian authors, that the cannon of Selim were linked together, to prevent the charge of the Persian cavalry, and that the sabre of the brave monarch cut asunder the large chain by which they were joined. But all was in vain; the day was irretrievably lost. The effect of so great a reverse upon the sanguine mind of Ismail, was deep and lasting: though before of a cheerful disposition, he was never afterwards seen to smile. The Turkish monarch reaped no other fruits from his victory but the glory of defeating Ismail, and the plunder of the Persian camp. A want of supplies forced him to retreat; and the great preparations which he subsequently made to conquer Persia, were directed against the Egyptians and Circassians, The death of Selim, which happened given us a copy of the letter which Sultan Selim addressed to Shah Ismail upon this occasion, which is at once arrogant and imperious.

He is styled in their histories Shah Shean f, or ' the King of the Sheahs an appellation which marks the affection with which his memory is regarded. Though he may not be entitled to their extravagant praises, he certainly was an able and valiant monarch. During his whole life he only suffered one defeat; and the large park of artillery, and improved knowledge in the science of war, which Sultan Selim must have derived from his intercourse with Europe, were no doubt the real causes of the advan tage which he gained over the gallant Ismail.

His presence settled this quarrel; and he hastened back to Khorassan, in which province one of his generals, whom he had left to keep the Usbegs in Encounters check, had been completely defeated. The royal army encountered the Usbegs! the enemy between the cities of Jam and Mushed, and gave them a a h. 934? signal overthrow. After this success, T4m4sp went to Bagdad; the government of which had been usurped by ZMfekdr Khan, a chief of the Kurd tribe, of K^ilhoor*, whom he took and put to death. Though the arms of the young king were victorious against all foreign enemies, the peace of his kingdom appears, at the com^ mencement of his reign, to have been continually disturbed by the jealousy, violence, and ambition, of the K ^zel-bash chiefs, who were alike eager to attain power during the minority of their sovereign, Feud between The tribe of Shamloof had one day a scuffle with that of TuMloo, Shamioo^aiid and pursued their chief, Jehan Sultan, till he took refuge in the king's T ; k ^ 0 i* 329 . tents; a conflict ensued with the royal guards, and Hussein Khan a. h. 936. gk am l 00 was slain.

Tdmdsp, who was now sixteen chap.xiv. years of age, heard the insulting proposal with undisguised indigna- tion. He called upon all the soldiers of his army to save their king x^p can* from being the prisoner of an insolent and overbearing tribe*. The E SMt appeal was successful, and almost all declared their readiness to him ' support their prince. Taking advantage of their warmth in his cause, he commanded a general attack of the tribe of TukMoo; and, though the clan was numerous and brave, they were soon overpowered; a great number of them were slain, and the re mainder compelled to find safety in flight. The Usbegs, taking advantage of the internal distractions of a. d . issa. Persia, invaded Khorassan, and invested Herat so closely, for a xht u s begs' period of eighteen months, that its wretched inhabitants were reduced to live upon the flesh of dogs and cats: but Tdmdsp advanced to their relief, and the Usbeg chief abandoned the siege, and retreated with precipitation into Tartary. A short time sub sequent to this event the tranquillity of the empire was threatened by a more serious danger. Solimdn, the Turkish Emperor of a.d.isss.

The Englishman replied, he was neither an unbeliever nor a Maho medan, but a Christian; and added, that he held Christ to be the greatest of prophets. The monarch to whom he was deputed said, that he was in no need of the aid of infidels, and bade him depart. He did so; and a man followed hiin from the hall of audience till he was beyond the precincts of the court, sprinkling sand on the path he walked over: an action which could only be meant to mark the sense which the Mahomedan prince had of the uncleanness of the person that he had suffered to approach him.

Fearing this impression, she sought him the moment his father expired, and, throwing herself at his feet, hailed him as sovereign of Persia.

When they entered the room, Ismail was found quite dead; and his companion* lying near him, almost senseless from intoxicationf.

The con fectioner added, that he had remarked this to Ismail, who replied, it was of no consequence, as a confidential female servant had opened it in his presence 1|.

The monarch was firm ; or rather those, who had complete power over his mind, would not consent to their own disgrace and ruin; and the consequence was, that in addition to the usurpation of Khorassan by Abbas, the invasion of Aderbijan, and the capture of Tabreez by the Turks, Mahomed saw himself involved in a civil war with those on whose support he had chiefly depended J. ^ • u The death of Osman Pacha, which took place at this period, The Turkish xmv &gt; army retreats. occas i on ed the retreat of the Turkish army: but a strong garrison was left in Tabreez, and it was necessary to besiege that city, at * Zubdrul-Tuarlkh. f Zubd-ul-Tuarikh. % Zubd-ul-Tuarikh.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ the same time that the insubordinate chiefs* were to be reduced, chap. xiv.

We are informed by all the historians who have written the life of Abbas, that before the death of Humzsl Meerza, repeated orders had been sent for that prince to repair to the court of his father: but though he always professed a disposition to obedience, the high nobles who governed the province of Khorassan in his name refused to permit his departure*. A prince of the blood royal, they alleged, was absolutely necessary to preserve the tranquillity of the province, which would, they asserted, be exposed to imminent danger if he left it. Mahomed tried the expedient of appointing powerful nobles to relieve those who thus evaded his orders; but his officers returned without being able to establish visited the Court of Persia a few years after this event, state, that the murder of Humza Meerza took place after the death of his father, and that he was King of Persia when he was slain. It seems hardly possible that the author of the Zubd-ul-Tuarikh (who was minister to Abbas the Second) could be mistaken in such a fact; and he could have no motive for omitting the name of this gallant prince in his list of Persian kings. The difference between oriental and European writers upon this point, is only to be reconciled by supposing, that as Mahomed Khodah-bundah was, for the few last years of his life, from blindness and weakness of character, incapable of rule, and had resigned all power to his son, the latter was conceived by foreigners to be the actual sovereign. Sir Anthony Sherley, who mentions Humz&amp;. Meerza being slain by a barber, informs us, that, after his death, the succession of Abbas was opposed by a faction of ambitious chiefs. Olearus, the author of the Ambassador's Travels, informs us, that IlumzS. Meerza reigned eight months, and his brother and successor, Ismail, an equal period. Yet the same author, who thus makes a lapse of sixteen months between Mahomed Khodah- bundah and his son Abbas, states, that the former died, and the latter ascended the throne, A.

This state —'' of affairs produced great confusion. Aly Kooli Khan and Mur- a,, Kooii shud Kooli Khan, two powerful chiefs of Kuzel-bash tribes, had ZliuS''' united their strength, on the plea of protecting Abbas, but with the in f ,l ' e 'w' real design of establishing their own power; the young prince ° fAbb ' appears to have been, at this period, a mere pageant in their hands. The union of these haughty and ambitious nobles could not be permanent. The friends soon became rivals ; and an action ensued. The, q „„ re i, in which Mnrshud Kooli Khan was victorious. The young prince, £££? at the commencement of this engagement, was with Aly Kooli. His riouS ' horse was shot during the heat of the battle; and he was, at one period, in imminent danger of losing his life : but we are told, that the victorious tribe of Oost^jaloo, as soon as thej saw the repre sentative of the sacred- family of Suffee in distress, stopped the pursuit, and threw themselves at his feet: nor did the pride of triumph prevent their leader from humbling himself before Abbas, with whom he immediately proceeded to Mushed*. It has already been stated that the chiefs of Khorassan had pro claimed Abbas King of Persia, and that Mahomed Khodah-bundah completely failed in the effort he made to re-establish his authority in that province. The confusion which ensued at the death of a. d. 1535.

A great number of the inhabitants of that city were soldiers of the royal army, and had accompanied Mahomed to Shiraz, where- that monarch had proceeded in order to suppress a rebellion. The troops of Abbas were directed to lodge themselves in the dwellings of the absentees; and a proclamation was issued, which stated, that the houses, families, and property of all persons who did not return to Kazveen within a very limited period, should belong to the soldiers by whom that city was then occupied. Nothing could exceed the dismay produced by this measure; and the unfortunate Mahomed^, to whom none were personally attached, was deserted by every inhabitant of Kazveen in his army. TheUsbegs The Usbegs invaded Khorassan immediately after Abbas left raIsan eKh0 ' it. They besieged Herat; which fell, after a defence of nine months, into their hands. Its governor, Aly Kooli Khan, and several other chiefs of consequence, were put to death, and the city plundered. After this success no opposition was made to their ravages, and all the province of Khorassan was laid waste. Abbas, who had been embarrassed by the war with the Turks, hastened to conclude a treaty of peace with the Emperor of Constantinople, that he might Abbas ad- march against the Usbegs. But though he advanced as far as Mushed! 0 Mushed, his attention appears, at this moment, to have, been more directed to the establishment of his own authority, than to the attack of the enemies of his country. Murshud Kooli Khan, from the moment of his victory over his rival, Aly Kooli, had exercised all the functions of a sovereign.

Impatient of his actual con- chap. xiv. dition, he had recourse to, perhaps, the only remedy which he could adopt; and the death of Murshud Kooli, who was slain a few days A - D - isse. after the army entered Khorassan *, gave this prince the possession A ' 995 ' of an authority which he never afterwards suffered to pass into the hands of another. Some events occurred which compelled the king to return to Returns to his his capital without an attempt to recover Herat: and he contented Capital ' himself with leaving a garrison at Mushed, which was soon after- A.D.issri wards attacked by Abd{d Momeen Khan -j-, the chief of the Usbegs.

The news of this dreadful event, combined with the alarming state of the king's health, threw the whole kingdom into confusion; and Abbas was occupied, for Abbas re- some time after his recovery, in restoring the internal tranquillity qdiikyThis of his dominions.

The Usbegs had continued their usual inroads into Khorassan: Marches but as their chief object was plunder, they always retired as the Persians advanced, and Abbas in vain endeavoured to bring them to an action. While his attention was engaged in preventing their inroads, and in reducing Laristan, and some other parts of his dominions, whose rulers had only granted his predecessors an uncer tain and conditional obedience, he was suddenly called from all considerations of foreign or domestic policy, by a prediction of his Prediction of astrologers; who, from the aspect of the heavenly bodies, had dis- theastrolosers covered that a most serious danger impended over the reigning sove reign of Persia. Abbas was not exempt from the superstition of the age in which he lived, and he did not hesitate to adopt the strange expedient by which his counsellors proposed to avert the dreaded omen.

In disobedience to their general, they rushed to the support of their prince, to whom they brought at once relief and victory : and the principal of these chiefs, Aly- verdi Beg, was promoted to the high office that had been so long enjoyed by Ferhdd Khan. This great victory gave the province of Khorassan a long respite from the inroads with which it had been, for some time, annually afflicted: and that province was, according to Persian historians, at once honoured and defended by the frequent visits of Abbas ; whose increasing devotion was shown in constant pilgrimages ^ to the tomb of the Imaum Aly Rezd, at Mushed. 'While the presence of the king a. d. leoo. gave prosperity and security to Khorassan, and enabled him to A ' 1009 ' extend his territories in that direction as far as Bulkh, his generals were employed in reducing the islands of the Gulf of Persia, of which Bahrein, on account of its magnitude and vicinity to the pearl banks on the coast of Arabia, was deemed the most valuable conquestf. The whole of the mountain province of Lar, which stretches from near Shiraz to the seaport of Gombroon, was also subdued ; and the vanity of Abbas was flattered, by his general, Aly-verdi Khan, sending, among the captives, Ibrahim Khan, the chief of that province, who boasted a direct descent from Goorgeen MeeMd J, one * The king, as a mark of his devotion, walked, on one occasion, with all his officers from Isfahan to Mushed ; and the chief astronomer measured the distance with a string fifty yards long.

Before the religion of Mahomed, and for some time afterwards, ' they recognised the authority of the kings of Persia; but particularly during the ' dynasty of the AkS,serah, (the name of the race of Nousheerwan,) but afterwards ' they became more independent. The first of the descendants of Goorgeen MeelSxl ' that embraced the faith was Irij, who took the name of Jul^ludeen; he was ruler ' of Mr in the time of Omar Abdul-Azeez, one of the last of the caliphs of the Benee ' Om&amp;,ee dynasty. From the time of the commencement of the Suffavean dynasty ' till the present period, (Shah Abbas the Great's reign,) they had been obedient, ' and held the high office of Ameer-Dewanee. Noor-a-Dahir Khan, the son of ' Abousheerwan, commonly called Shah Adil, was, at the commencement of the ' reign of Shah Ismail, the W&amp;.ly of Lar. Noor-a-D§,hir died in the reign of Sultan ' Mahomed Khodah-bundah: he was succeeded by his son, Ibrahim Khan, who, when ' Shah Abbas marched to Shiraz to punish Yakoob Khan, neglected to join and ' congratulate him as he passed near L&amp;r. The king, enraged at this neglect, and at ' his repeated false excuses for non-attendance, ordered Aly-verdi Khan, ruler of Fars, ' to march into L^r. Ibrahim Khan was unable to meet Aly-verdi in the field, and ' retired into the Fort of Mr: he was, however, soon obliged to surrender himself and ' all his property to the leader of the royal army. Among his property was found a ' crown ornamented with rich jewels, such as rubies and pearls; it was called the TSj ' Kai Khoosroo, or ' the crown of Kai Khoosroo,' and had descended regularly from ' L&amp;r, the son of Goorgeen MeelSxl, to Ibrahim Khan, all of whose ancestors had worn « it as a diadem propitious to their rule. The City of Mr had formerly another name. « it is said, that when Goorgeen died, he left a son called Mr, who was nominated to ' succeed him; and the city was called after him : and Kai Khoosroo invested him ' with the crown that has been described, which had remained in the family ever since: ' and it is also related, that when Goorgeen Meel^Ld was appointed ruler of Mr, he ' remained encamped on the outside of that city seven years, waiting for a fortunate ' hour to make his entry. This the astrologers, at the expiration of that time, dis- ' covered, and he went into the town; and from that date, which is near four thousand « years, his family have retained their rule as chiefs, though they have usually paid « tribute to the monarchs of Persia.' * Zubd-ul-Tuarikh.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 531 Abbas was encouraged by these successes to a greater effort. He chap. xiv. had been compelled, by the situation of his kingdom, to preserve peace with the Emperor of Constantinople; but he could hardly deem himself the monarch of Persia while that sovereign held the Fort of Nahavund in one quarter of his dominions, and the cities of Meditates the Tabreez and Teflis, with almost the whole of Aderbijan and of TeTon of Georgia, in another. The misfortunes of his great ancestor, Ismail, ^ d . T sos and the almost uniform success which had attended the Turks in their ^ H - 1011 • wars with the Persians, were calculated to make him proceed with great caution: and our opinion of the character of this prince is greatly raised, by a consideration of the means he collected, and the measures he adopted, to effect the emancipation of the finest provinces of his country from the rule of so powerful an enemy. The most extraordinary events are often traced to accidental causes; but we should not hastily detract from those claims which genius always has upon fortune. The faculty possessed by superior minds of rendering those occurrences which are deemed trivial by other men subservient to great designs, may be compared to the power of the telescope, which gives magnitude to objects that have altogether escaped the unaided vision. It was at this period of his reign that two English gentlemen, of good family, and military reputation, sought the court of Abbas. They were brothers; and the eldest, Sir Anthony Sherley, gives us an account of the reasons which led him to travel into Persia. He had been encouraged by the Earl of Essex to Cause of Sir proceed with some soldiers of approved valour to aid the Duke of le/^prJce^d- Ferrara against the pretensions of the Pope*. The struggle was lngtoPersia - Sir Anthony Sherley's Travels, page 4.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xiv. decided by the submission of the duke, before the English knight reached the scene of action : but the noble patron, unwilling that one whom he had selected for such an enterprise should return, after a waste of ' time, money, and hope*,' without effecting any purpose, proposed to Sir Anthony to proceed to Persia; a country which, from the commerce that it carried on by land with the territories of Turkey and Russia, and by sea with the Portuguese and Dutch, had become, about this period, an object of some attention to the English nation. The companions of Sir Anthony's journey were his brother. Sir Robert Sherley, and twenty-six followers, ' gallantly mounted, ' and richly furnished-f*.' Among the latter there were men of some science: one is particularly mentioned as being skilled in the art of casting cannon. Sir Anthony Sherley neither had, nor assumed, any right to the character of a public representative. He reached Kaz- veen when Abbas was in Khorassan : and when the monarch returned to that city after his victory over the Usbegs, he presented himself as an English soldier of fortune, who, hearing of the great fame of Abbas, desired the honour of entering his service. He at the same time propitiated a good reception by a handsome present J.

Ooxj Alj-verdi Beg, who had been raised to the command of the chap. xiv. arm j , became the declared friend and supporter of the European favourite; and all his influence was exerted to repel the attacks made upon him by those ministers who were adverse to hostilities with Turkey, and who represented the advice which Sir Anthony Sherley gave Abbas, on that occasion, as proceeding from the treacherous designs of a secret agent of a Christian court, that wished to promote its own interest, by embroiling true believers in war. But Sir Anthony did not advise the monarch, in whose service he had entered, to engage in a contest, without pointing out the means of rendering that successful. He offered himself as the instrument for establishing an alliance between Abbas and the monarchs of Christ endom ; one of whom, Rodolph the Second, sovereign of Germany, was at that period engaged in a war with the Emperor of Constanti nople. His sincerity in the cause he had adopted, was proved by his leaving his brother, Sir Robert, at the Persian court, and by the pains he took to instruct the Persians in the science of war. The progress of the new corps of infantry which Abbas had raised to make himself independent of his turbulent chiefs, and to oppose in the field to the Turkish janissaries, probably owed their dis cipline* to the counsel and aid of the two Sherleys, and their ' furnished, two with exceeding rich saddles, plated with gold, and set with rubies ' and turquoises; the rest either plated with silver, or velvet embroidered and gilt; ' sixteen mules and twelve camels laden with tents and furniture for his house and ' voyage.'—Sir A nthony S herley's Travels, page 72. # The following passage, from a memorial of the Travels of Sir Robert Sherley, written by a cotemporary, appears to prove this fact: — ' The mightie Ottoman, terror of the Christian world, quaketh of a Sherly feuer, ' and gives hopes of approaching fates: the prevailing Persian hath learned Sherleian534 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xiv. military followers.

The firman, or grant*, issued on this occasion, gave the fullest security to all such, both as to the • Copy of an English translation of the Grant obtained by Sir Anthony Sherley from Shah Abbas, for all Christians to trade and traffick in Persia : — ' Our absolute commaundement, will, and pleasure, is, that our cuntries and do minions shall be, from this day, open to all Christian people, and to their religion : and in such sort, that none of ours, of any condition, shall presume to giue them any euil word.

Abbas'saction The Turkish army amounted to upwards of one hundred thousand with the Turks that of Abbas was litt i e m ore than half the number}. * Some authors state, that Abbas made himself master of the City of Tabreez by a stratagem. Having disguised a party as merchants, he sent them in advance; they were incautiously admitted, and seized upon the fort. But father Anthoine de Govvea, who was envoy from Philip the Second of Spain at the Court of Abbas, gives a full relation of the proceedings at this period: and he states, that the life of Ali P^ha was saved on condition of his son surrendering Tauris ; which was given up to Abbas on Sunday, the 6th of June, A. D. 1603, after being eighteen years in the possession of the Turks. f The name, or rather title of their leader, was J&amp;gh&amp;l-aghh. This general, whose harsh appellation is softened into Cigala by Anthoine de Govvea, was a great favonrite both of Sultan Amfirath the Third, and of his son, Mahomed the Third. He did not long survive his defeat by Abbas; and his death, which took place in 1607, was deemed a joyful event by the Christians, of whom he was a bigoted oppressor. De Govvea, when he relates this event, adds: ' God, like a merciful father, is « wont to break those reeds with which he chastiseth his children.'—Betoions Guerres, fyc. page 338. % The Persian writers who record this action make the difference greater. I follow Anthoine de Govvea, who computes the Turks at one hundred thousand, and theTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. He nevertheless determined (against the advice of all his ablest generals) to bring his enemies to action. The Turks advanced, as he expected, with a vast column of horse in front, which was supported by a line of infantry and cannon. Abbas, when they approached near, directed Aly-verdi to make a sweep round their flank with a small body of cavalry; but instructed him to keep at such a distance, that he should not be discovered till he gained their rear. He was then commanded to cover as large a space of ground as he possibly could with his numbers, and make a false attack upon them. The clouds of dust raised by this body were no sooner observed by the Turks, who were advancing against the main army of the Persians, than their general conceived it was the prin cipal attack, and that it was directed against the camp, which had been left almost unguarded. A great proportion of the column in front was immediately detached to repel it. Regular armies alone can manoeuvre with safety during the heat of battle. In those which have no discipline, every movement, but particularly one to the rear, is certain of producing confusion, and that soon becomes irremedi able. The force which the Turkish general had detached was sup posed, by almost all their own army, and that of the Persians, to have fled*. Abbas seized the moment of these impressions for a general charge; and his troops, already confident of success, gained an easy victory -f- over men dismayed by the supposed desertion army of Abbas at sixty-two thousand. This author asserts, that it was Zeena Begum, the daughter of Shah Tam^sp, and aunt of Abbas, who stimulated that prince to fight this great battle. — Relations de G tier res, page 287. * Zubd-ul-Tuarikh, t Sir Robert Sherley attended the Persian monarch in this action, and received three wounds.— P ubohas's Pilgrims, Vol. II. page 1806.540 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xiv. of their comrades. The leaders of the Turkish army did all that personal valour could to recover the day, and the numbers of offi cers of high rank that were slain or taken prisoners *, prove the great efforts which they made: but all was in vain; the overthrow was complete, and the Turks fled in every direction, leaving the field in possession of the Persians-f-. The action was hardly over before sunset, and the pursuit con tinued for many hours. An event occurred after this victory, which is alike characteristic of the times, and of the hero by whom it was gained. As Shah Abbas sat upon the field of battle, carousing with his chief officers and some of the principal captives, a man of uncommon stature and soldier-like appearance was led past by a youth, who had just made him prisoner. The king demanded who that was. ' I belong to the Kurd family of Mookree,' said the cap tive. The king happened to have an officer of the house of Mookree in his service, of the name of Roostum Beg, who he knew had a blood feud with the family of the prisoner. ' Deliver that captive ' to Roostum Beg/' said the king: but that chief refused to receive him. ' I hope your majesty will pardon me/' he said; ' my honour, ' it is true, calls for his blood, but I have made a vow never to take ' advantage of an enemy who is bound, and in distress J!' This noble and generous speech seemed to reflect upon the king, who, in his irritation, called to the captain of the guards to strike off the head of the prisoner.

A struggle ensued; and, in the general hurry of all to aid their sovereign, every light was extin guished, and no one dared to strike in the dark, lest he should pierce the monarch instead of his enemy*. After a moment of inexpressible horror, all were relieved by hearing the king twice exclaim, ' I have seized his hand! I have seized his hand!'' Order was restored, and lights brought. The brave but unfor tunate captive was slain by a hundred swords: and Abbas, who had wrested the dagger from his hand, reseated himself in the assembly, and continued (according to his historian-f) ' to drink ' goblets of pure wine, and to receive the heads J of his enemies, ' till twelve o'clock at night.'

The courts of Isfahan and Constantinople continued, during the whole of this monarch's reign, to carry on negotiations of an amicable nature; but though peace was often proclaimed, it never prevented hostilities from being resorted to when the slightest prospect of advantage invited an attack. The usual mode was to encourage the p^ch^s, or rulers of the frontier provinces, to commence aggressions; and the Emperor of Turkey, or King of Persia, either disclaimed or supported the acts of these governors as policy dictated: the fact was, that the ambition of the sovereigns of both these nations was inflamed and seconded by the bigotry of their subjects, who desired war, to give vent to those feelings of hatred and detestation with which their opposite belief led them to consider each other. The Sheah historians of this period dwell with satisfaction on the most cruel acts, when a Soonee is the sufferer; and they hardly ever relate the death of a Turkish leader without devoting his soul to hell, as * The Pachas of Van and Erzeroom were slain in this action. The Turkish general, Huleel PS,ch&amp;, in a letter he wrote to Sir Paul Pinder, ambassador from the King of England at Constantinople, claims a victory over K^rachee Khan, whom he describes as abandoning Tabreez to be sacked by the Turkish army 3 '. He, however, admits, that in the action which afterwards took place at Shiblee, some of his army fell; which, in such a document, is acknowledging a defeat. t Zubd-ul-Tuarikh. 31 Purchas's Pilgrims, Vol, II. page 1613.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 543 the fit mansion for all such heretics.

Shah Abbas endeavoured by every means to increase those Abbas almost feelings of religious respect with which he was regarded by his subjel^ hl! subjects : and when we consider the enthusiasm of the age, his claims as the inheritor of the mantle of the saints of Ardebil, and the impression made by the victories which he had obtained over the heretic Turks, we are not surprised that he should almost have been adored: but, if we are to believe Persian writers, veneration for the holy character of the king was not confined to animated nature: it was imparted to substances which are the least susceptible of such impressions. We are gravely told, that on Abbas entering his kitchen at Ardebil, the lid of one of the pots that he approached raised itself twice, (four inches each time,) as if in respect to his royal person: and this wonder, or miracle, was attested not only by all the cooks, but by several officers of the court, who were in attend ance upon the king when it occurred *.

That nation had, under the great Alphonso de conquests Albuquerque, conquered all the islands of the Gulf: but Portugal Port^ese'n no longer held a high rank among the states of Europe, and her ^3^ of distant possessions were rapidly declining. Of the numerous settle ments which Albuquerque had made on the coast of Persia, Ormus, which was the first, was almost the only one that remained. This situation and island lies at the entrance of the Gulf, and is only a few leagues iTilCd of distant from Gombroon. It has neither vegetation nor fresh water. 0rmus ' Its circumference is not twenty miles; both its hills and plains are formed of salt; and that mineral is not only impregnated in its streams, but crusts over them like frozen snow. The nature of the soil, or rather the surface of the earth, renders the heat of summer * more intolerant at Ormus, than in any of those parched islands, or provinces, with which it is surrounded; and unless we consider the advantages which it derives from its excellent harbour and local situa tion, it appears to be one of the last spots on the globe which human beings would desire to inhabit. The first settlers on this island were its first set- some Arabs, who were compelled by the Tartar invaders of Persia to leave the Continent. These gave it the name of Hormuz, or Ormus; being that of the district which they had been obliged to abandon. One old fisherman, whose name was Geroon, is said to have been its sole inhabitant when this colony arrived. They re- its conquest mained masters of Ormus till conquered by Albuquerque; and it ^ lbuquer had been in the possession of the Portuguese for more than a century. ^ ^ It had become, during that period, the emporium of all the commerce under whom vol. 1. 4 a546 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xiv. of the Gulf: merchants from every quarter of the globe had flocked to a city* where their property and persons were secure against it became a great empo- injustice and oppression, and from whence they could carry on a rram of com- ' . , » i • -imi i* merce. profitable commerce with Persia, Arabia, and Turkey, without being exposed to the dangers attendant on a residence in these barbarous and unsettled countries. Abbas re- Abbas saw with envy the prosperity of Ormus : he could not conquest of understand the source from which that was derived, and looked is assisted by to its conquest as an event that would add to both the glory and the English. W ealth of his kingdom. Emaun Kooli Khan, Governor of Fars, received orders to undertake this great enterprise; but the king was well aware that it would be impossible to succeed without the aid of a naval equipment. The English were ready auxiliaries. An agreement, which exempted them from paying customs on the merchandise they imported at Gombroon, and gave them a share of the duties taken from others, added to boundless promises of future favour, were the bribes by which the agents of the East India Company were induced to become the instruments a. d. 1622. of destroying this noble settlement. A fleet was soon collected. The Portu- Persian troops were embarked, and the attack made. The Portu- r guese defended themselves bravely; but, worn down by hunger render. an(1 f at ig uej an( i altogether hopeless of succour, they were compelled to surrender.

Abbas was overjoyed at the conquest: but all the magni- chap. xiv. ficent plans which he had formed from having a great seaport in his dominions, terminated in his giving his own name to Gombroon, which he commanded to be in future called Bunder Abbas, or the Port of Abbas*. The hopes which the servants of the East India Company had The English cherished from the expulsion of the Portuguese from Ormus, and poLedT 13 * their other possessions, were completely disappointed. The treaty which Abbas entered into to obtain their aid, by which it was stipulated that all plunder should be equally divided, that each should appoint a governor, and that the future customs both of Ormus and Gombroon f should be equally shared, was disregarded * If the English ever indulged a hope of deriving permanent benefit from the share they took in this transaction, they were completely disappointed. They had, it is true, revenged themselves upon an enemy they hated, destroyed a flourishing settlement, and brought ruin and misery upon thousands, to gratify the avarice and ambition of a despot, who promised to enrich them by a favour, which they should have known was not likely to protect them, even during his life, from the violence and injustice of his own officers, much less during that of his successors. The history of the English fac tory at Gombroon, from this date till it was finally abandoned, is one series of disgrace, of losses, and of dangers, as that of every such establishment in a country like Persia must be. Had that nation either taken Ormus for itself, or made a settlement on a more eligible island in the Gulf, it would have carried on its commerce with that quarter to much greater advantage; and its political influence, both in Persia and Arabia, would have remained unrivalled. t By the treaty between Abbas and the agents of the Company, all Mahomedans made captive were to be given up to the King of Persia, and all Christians, to the English. Mr. Monnox, when he reports the fall of the island, boasts of his. humanity to the prisoners; but adds, ' I must trust to Heaven for my reward, for the Portuguese ' are but slenderly thankful.'548 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xiv. from the moment the conquest was completed. The sanguine anticipations of one of their chief agents, who wrote* to England court disre- ' that their dear infant,' (this term was applied to the commercial gagements' 1 factory at Gombroon,) ' would receive new life if the king but ' kept his word,' soon vanished: and we find the same person, after the fall of Ormus, statingf, that no benefit whatever can be expected from that possession, unless it be held exclusively by the English. But every expectation of advantage that had been indulged, was soon dispelled by the positive refusal of Abbas to allow the English either to fortify Ormus, or any other harbour in the Gulf.

Sir Thomas states, that one such attack will do the Company's affairs more good than a dozen defences; and adds, that he has written to the Sooffe^ of Persia, advising him not to inthrall himself with Spain.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 549 from Ormus made a change in this policy; and two years after chap. xiv. that event, Sir Robert Sherley appeared in England as an envoy from Abbas to King James the First. Nothing could be more Sherl ey's ap- pearance in exaggerated than the impressions which he desired to convey to England as ambassador the British Court of the wealth and resources of Persia; and their from Abbas, fallacy was very fully exposed by the Directors of the East India Company: but the king's government were nevertheless flattered by the prospect of gain that was presented to them; and Sir Robert Sherley had the art to connect the settlement of his own private a, d. less, concerns with the general objects of national advantage. A gentle- sir Dodmore man of family and rank, Sir Dodmore Cotton, was named ambas- poTntTd am- sador to Abbas, and instructed to proceed to Persia, accompanied 10 by Sir Robert Sherley, and a numerous suite. This ambassador had his first public audience at the City of Ashraff, in Mazenderan. The pride of the King of Persia could not but be gratified by so splendid a mission; and the forms and ceremonies with which it was received, are very characteristic of the style and manners of the Court of Abbas *. Sir Dodmore Cotton, and the gentlemen with him, were seated, a. d. lear.

From this chamber they were carried through two other apartments, which are described as most richly ornamented, and filled with golden vessels, adorned with rich jewels, which * Sir Thomas Herbert's Travels.550 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xiv. contained rose-water, flowers, and wine. After passing through these apartments, they entered the hall of state, round the walls of which the chief officers of the empire were seated like so many statues, for not a muscle moved, and all was dead silence*. Beautiful boys, with spangled turbans and embroidered dresses, held in their hands golden goblets of wine, and proffered that beverage to all who desired it. Abbas was clothed in a plain dress of red cloth. He wore no finery about his person : his sabre alone had a gold hilt. Those high nobles who sat nearest him were also attired in a plain manner: and it was evident that the king, surrounded as he was with wealth and grandeur, affected simplicity : but perhaps his pre tensions as a religious character required this public display of his personal-f contempt of the vanities and riches of the world. The ambassador explained, through his interpreter J, the objects of his mission; which were, to enter into a league with Persia against the Turks, to obtain satisfaction for Sir Robert Sherley, an English gentleman, who had been in the service of Shah Abbas, but had been injured and defrauded by a Persian noble man || lately deceased, and to increase the trade between the two kingdoms. The answer of the king was most gracious. He expressed * Sir Thomas Herbert, the learned writer of the history of this mission, who attended Sir Dodmore Cotton, admirably describes this row of public officers, whom he calls ' tacite meerzaes, chawns, sultans, and beglerbegs.'

Abbas, we are told, was much amused with Sir Dod- more Cotton's inability to comply with the custom of the country in sitting cross-legged ; but being desirous of pleasing his guest, he called for a goblet of wine, and drank to the health of the King of England. At the name of his sovereign the ambassador stood up, and took his hat off. Abbas smiled, and raised his own turban from his head, as a token that he shared in that feeling of respect for the sovereign of England which Sir Dodmore's action indicated. This pleasant and honourable reception raised great expectations, but they ended in complete disappointment.

His desire was to establish general tranquillity, which he knew in a despotic government must be founded on terror, and a com plete submission to the authority of the monarch. He perfectly succeeded in the accomplishment of this object; and the long peace which Persia afterwards enjoyed, is to be chiefly ascribed to The improve- the wisdom of his measures.

He increased the stream of the River Zainderood, which flowsTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. o53 greatly ornamented bj him; and the cities of Ashraff and Ferrahabad, chap xiv in Mazenderan, were adorned with several royal mansions. But these were his meanest works. He carried, at an immense expense, a causeway * across the whole of Mazenderan ; and rendered that difficult country passable for armies and travellers at all seasons of the year. He threw bridges over almost all the rivers in Persia; and the traveller in that country met, in every direction, the most solid and spacious caravanseries, which had been erected by the royal munificence of this monarch. Abbas has been accused, and with justice, of acting with Abbas e„- the greatest cruelty toward the princes of Georgia f, and the inha- Sit bitants of that province. His conduct was very different to a settleiaPersi3 through this river, by bringing those of another stream to join it. He revived an attempt that had been made by his predecessor, Tamasp, to bring the Karoon into it, but failed, after great efforts, to effect this object. # ' The causeway of Mazenderan is in length about three hundred miles, and it ' runs ^ rom Kiskar, in the south-west of the Caspian, several leagues beyond Astera- ' bad in the south-east. The pavement is now nearly in the same condition as it was ' in the time of Hanway; being perfect in many places, although it has hardly ever ' been repaired.

Instead of making them slaves, and com pelling them to change their belief, as his predecessors had done in similar cases, he sought to give his native country the benefit of their knowledge and their industry. For this purpose he settled them in different parts of the kingdom, and not only gave them liberty to build churches, and to exercise the duties of their religion, but granted them many other important privileges; and personally afforded them the most liberal protection and encouragement. The principal of these colonies was Julfd, one of the suburbs of Isfahan, which he built to receive the inhabitants of a town of the same name in Armenia. It flourished in a degree that far exceeded expectation; and Abbas lived to see his wise policy rewarded by the happiness and gratitude of its inhabitants, who, devoted to commerce, and far more industrious than the Persians, enriched themselves *, while they advanced, by the great trade they carried on with India and other quarters, the general prosperity of the empire. He sought also to enrich his favourite province of Mazenderan with a similar establishment.

The kingdom to which Abbas succeeded was in an unsettled state. The nobles were bold and seditious, and every province was ripe for rebellion. It must have required many and dreadful examples before such a country could have been reduced to that tranquillity which the general good required; and the energetic individual who effected this beneficial change, must often have seemed to act the part of a cruel tyrant+ We can dis- them; the king furnishing camels for its conveyance. Chardin, who mentions the colony of Armenians at Julfa as an instance of the excellent government of Abbas, declares, that they were possessed of no property when they arrived, but at the end of thirty years they were so affluent, that there were more than sixty of them who possessed from one hundred thousand to two millions of crowns. * Chardin. t He, on some occasions, cut off the nose and ears of governors who were convicted of injustice, and often inflicted the punishment of tukht koollah on officers who had been guilty of male-administration.

Sometimes he was beaten, and forced to dance like a buffoon.— Sher- ley's Travels, t Let us imagine, in the present tranquil state of our own country, that all criminals whom the laws condemn were sentenced by our king, and that the Court-yard of St. James's was the place of execution.

Measures a- monarch had been early compelled to repress the ambition dopted to re press the tur- of the principal chiefs of the KAzel-bash tribes, and had put several bulence of the Mzei-bash of them to death. He sought another defence against the effects of their turbulence, by forming a tribe of his own, which he styled Shah Sevund, or ' the king's friends;' and he invited men of all tribes to enrol themselves in a clan, which he considered as devoted to his family, and therefore distinguished by his peculiar favour and pro tection. Volunteers could not be wanting at such a call: and we have one instance of ten thousand men being registered by the name of Shah-Sevund in one day*. This tribe, which became remarkable for its attachment to the Suffavean dynasty, still exists in Persia, though with diminished numbers. It could once boast of more than a hundred thousand families. Shah Abbas took another mode of releasing himself and his posterity from the dangers to which they were exposed from the turbulence of the K^izel-bash chiefs. The koortchy, or army, composed of their followers, amounted to between fifty and sixty thousand horsemen. The men of whom this force was composed would only obey leaders of their own tribe; and the king could not advance a favourite, except he was the chief of a Ktizel-bash family, to any rank or command in his army. Abbas reduced the number of * Zubd-ul-Tuarikh.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ this formidable body to thirty thousand, and raised a corps of ten chap. xiv. thousand horse, and twelve thousand foot, who received their pay from the crown, and were commanded by those officers whom the monarch thought fit to appoint. The soldier who belonged to this corps was called kooldr, or gholam, both words signifying ' slave if literally interpreted; but deemed an honourable ap pellation, which distinguished them as the personal guards of the king. The infantry were called tuffungchee, or musqueteers, and were the first ever embodied in Persia. Abbas is said to have chiefly intended them to oppose the janizaries-f* of Turkey; but they were otherwise useful, as they constituted a defence to the monarch against the violence of his nobles.

The Sudder-ul-Suddoor, or high pontiff of Persia, was a station first established by his ancestor. Shah Ismail. Syuds, or, in other words, descendants of the prophet, were alone nominated to this office, the powers of which were very great. There were also several other stations held by Moollahs, or men of a sacred character, the duties of which were important. In the reigns of the immediate predecessors of Abbas, the quarrels of these priests with each other had been the cause of serious troubles. Their influence was con siderable; each had his disciples and supporters; and their discord and disunion had more than once threatened the tranquillity of the state. Abbas used to boast, that his reign was exempt from these divisions. And it is related, that when he was one day riding with the celebrated Meer Mahomed Banker DamM on his right hand, and the equally famed Shaikh B4h^udeen Aumilee* on his left, the king desired to discover if there lurked any secret envy, or jealousy, in the breasts of these two learned priests. Turning to Meer Mahomed Banker, whose horse was prancing and capering, he observed, ' What a dull brute Shaikh B^haudeen is riding! he ' cannot make the animal keep pace with us.'—' The wonder is, &lt;s how the horse moves at all,' said the Moollah, ' when we consider ' what a load of learning and knowledge he has upon his back.' Abbas, after some time, turned round to Shaikh B&amp;Mudeen, and said to him, ' Did you ever see such a prancing animal as that which Meer ♦ Both these doctors of law are held in the highest repute by the Sheahs, and their works are of great authority on all points connected with the laws. ^elfthejTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. oo9 « Mahomed Banker rides ? Surely that is not the style for a horse chap. xiv. « to go in who carries a grave Moollah.'—« Your majesty will, i ' am assured/' said the Shaikh, ' forgive the horse, when you reflect « on the just right he has to be proud of his rider.' The monarch bent his head forward on his saddle, and returned thanks to the Almighty for the singular blessing he had bestowed upon his reign, of two wise and pious men; who, though living at a court, had minds untainted by envy and hatred*. The preference which this ruler showed for. his own faith, did Remarkable not prevent his tolerating others. To the Christians in his domi- ^pmicT- nions he was particularly favourable. This feeling was, in a great degree, excited by his hatred of the Turks, and his desire to negotiate, with the potentates of Europe, a combination against the Emperor of Constantinople. Sir Robert Sherley, who had been left by his brother Sir Anthony in Persia, became a great favourite at court. His house was the asylum for Christians of all nations, and he was long the channel through which their complaints were brought to the ears of Abbas. That monarch bestowed a beautiful Circassian lady on Sir Robert, as his wife: and we are told by an authority -f we cannot doubt, that the Mahomedan king stood godfather to the first-born of the English knight. We need not desire further proof than what this anecdote affords of the nature of that toleration which Christians enjoyed during this monarch's reign. * Persian MSS.

Sherley when he enjoyed the favour of Abbas.560 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xiv. In his conduct to his own family the character of Abbas appears in so horrid a light, that we can hardly permit our minds to indulge in that admiration which the other measures of his reign are calculated to inspire: but we must consider, that one of the most terrible conditions on which human beings hold absolute power, is the necessity of viewing those who are nearest in blood as the enemies that are most to be dreaded. The next heir to a despot must always be an object of his jealousy, and that will generally increase in proportion to the qualities and popularity of the destined successor. This certainly was the case with the great Abbas, who had four sons, whom he beheld with delight until they attained manhood, and began to display those noble qualities which he must, as a father, have desired them to possess: but when the wishes of his heart seemed fulfilled, he could not bear that the eyes of his subjects should be directed for a moment to any object but himself*. Those who served his sons with zeal and attachment he considered his enemies; and the courtiers near his person laboured to aggravate feelings by which they hoped to destroy rivals who they conceived were eager for the enjoyment of their high stations. A want of confidence in the king produced alarm in his sons. They saw themselves objects of a restless jealousy, that misinter preted all their actions. We may believe, that when they found that their loyalty could not preserve them from danger, they * Chardia refers the murder of his eldest son to the circumstance of Abbas having perceived, as he came out of his inner apartments, that the eyes of his nobles were turned with delight towards that promising prince. — C hardin , Vol. III. page 314.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 5ol listened to those counsellors who pointed out a direct, though chap . xiv. dangerous path to safety. Abbas was led to believe that Suffee Meerza, his eldest son, who was a youth as remarkable for valour as generosity, had formed a design against his life, in consequence of his having put to death the nobleman who was the friend and favourite of that prince. Under this impression he forgot that he was a father. We are told, that he first applied to Kdr^chee Khan, the brave general who had defeated the Turks at Shiblee, to become the executioner of Suffee. The veteran leader threw himself upon the ground, and entreated his sovereign to deprive him of life rather than render his existence hateful by compelling him to become the murderer of a gallant prince. Abbas did not urge him fur ther; but he soon found a willing instrument in Beh-bood Khan. That noble, on the pretext of revenging a private injury, stabbed who is stab- the prince as he was riding to the court, and took refuge at the boodKhfn'' stable of the king; who, pretending to respect an usage which renders that asylum sacred, refrained from the execution of the assassin *. Such an act would, he said, bring suspicion in an affair * The author of the Zubd-ul-Tuarikh tries to palliate this murder, by describing it as an act of personal revenge of Beh-bood Khan. In the Aulum-aurah the following account is given of it. « Suffee Meerza was the son of Shah Abbas : the father and ' son had long been on indifferent terms, and numbers wished to persuade the king ' that his son sought his life.' But the king would never believe this : he, however, put to death two of the prince's servants, who, he was persuaded, endeavoured to mislead him. Beh-bood Khan, this writer adds, was one of the king's favourite gholams, who, ' satisfied that Suffee Meerza wanted to kill the king, stabbed him, ' and took refuge in the royal stable,' which is in Persia the most sacred of asylums. VOL. I. 4 c wpp562 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xiv. that required deliberation, and he should therefore defer all pro- ceedings till the infant son of Suffee Meerza was of age, and able to demand vengeance for the blood of his father. But even this thin veil was soon cast aside, and Beh-bood Khan was not only permitted to quit his asylum, but promoted to high stations*. It is, however, consolatory to know that this wretch ultimately met with a fate suited to his crime. Abbas, who from the moment this rash act was committed became a prey to remorse, had taken an opportunity of putting to death-f* every one of those courtiers who had poisoned his mind against a son whom he is said to have sincerely mourned J: but for Beh-bood Khan he reserved a more inhuman punishment: he commanded that obsequious lord to bring him the head of his own son. The devoted slave obeyed. As he presented the head of the youth, Abbas demanded, with a smile of bitter scorn, how he felt. ' I am miserable' was the reply. ' You should be happy, Beh-bood/' said Abbas, ' for you ' are ambitious, and in your feelings you are at this moment ' the equal of your sovereign H' Soon after the death of SufFee Meerza, the two remaining sons § of Abbas were both deprived of sight by the cruel suspicions of * Zubd-ul-Tuarikh. t Ambassador's Travels. J Abbas, we are told, shut himself up in his palace for a month, covered his eyes for ten days, and wore mourning for a year. He ever afterwards wore the plainest clothes, and made the place where the prince died a sanctuary for criminals. || That death which the cruelty of Abbas refused to Beh-bood was soon afterwards given him by one of his slaves; who, to save himself from punishment, stabbed him while he lay senseless from intoxication. § The second son of Abbas, whose name was Tamasp Meerza, died before he had put the eldest to death.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. their unnatural parent. The fate of one of these princes was (if we can credit the testimony of a cotemporary writer* of our own nation,) attended with circumstances of the most tragical nature. This youth, whose name was Khod^h-bund^h f, was as much distin guished for his courage and talents as his elder brother; but he was more cautious to avoid that attention which he feared would rouse the jealousy of his father, and he not only kept flatterers at a dis tance, but hated to hear those just praises which his actions obtained him. This conduct only added to that fame which constituted his danger. The first act by which Abbas showed his suspicion, was in ordering the tutor and attached friend of his son to be put to death J. * Sir Thomas Herbert. His account differs from that of Olearus, but the former is entitled to credit. The Zubd-ul-Tuarikh states, that the name of the prince murdered by Beh-bood was Suffee Meerza, and that of the one whose eyes were put out was Khod&amp;h-bundtih; and this is confirmed by the following passage of a letter from Mr. Edward Monnox, agent for the India Company, dated Isfahan, 1621 : ' The king, (Shah Abbas,) before he came to Isfahan, caused the eyes of his present ' eldest son, Goda-bunda Meerza, to be put out, and then confined him. His son ' Emanullah also confined, but not yet blinded. King means, they think, to leave ' the throne to his grandchild (then ten or twelve years of age).

Albeit that beast is very hateful to his ' profession.'— Public Records, India House. t He was also called Reza Meerza. — Zubd-ul-Tuarikh. t The name of this person was, according to Sir T.

Conscious that the only crime of this officer was too great a regard £ or masterj p r i nce hastened to court, and in giving vent to the honest indignation which the conduct of Abbas had kindled, he lost all consideration for his own safety. We are told, that he was provoked to madness, and in the presence of his father and sovereign drew his sword. The fatal signal for his death was given : but Abbas relented so far, as only to deprive him of sight. Shut out from the light of day, the prince became gloomy and desperate; nothing could give him pleasure ; and his life passed in venting curses and brooding over plans of vengeance against the author of his being and of his misery. He had two children, of whom the eldest, Fatimah, a lovely girl, was a great favourite of her grandfather, over whose mind she had acquired the most astonishing influence. Abbas appeared miserable when little Fa timah was not near him, and her voice alone could soothe him when ruffled by those violent passions to which he every day became more subject. The prince learnt, with savage delight, how essential his daughter had become to the happiness of his father, and seizing her, as she one day came to fondle upon his bosom, with all the fury of a maniac, he in an instant deprived her of life. The astonished mother shrieked, and told him it was his darling daughter that he was destroying. Instead of attend ing to her, his next effort was to seize his infant son, that he might vent his fury upon him. The child was borne from him by the distracted princess, who sent immediately to inform xibbas of what had occurred. The rage and despair into which the sove reign w T as thrown gave a momentary joy to his son; who, glutted with his terrible vengeance, concluded the scene by swallowing aTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 565 dose of poison, which in a moment terminated his miserable life *, chap. xiv. Such were the scenes which marked the last days of Abbas, who, worn out with affliction of mind, and the pain of a disease which his b'- 15 - 1 intemperate habits had increased, died in his favourite palace at I h .' JS Ferr^hdbad, in Mazenderan, at the age of seventy. He had been a 23dJumadee - ul -euvul. nominal ruler almost from his birth, and had been sovereign of all Persia forty-three years. Shah Abbas had a fine face, of which the most remarkable Description features were a high nose, and a keen and piercing eye. He wore ofAbbas • no beard, but had large mustachios, or whiskers. In his stature he was rather low, but must have been uncommonly robust and active, as he was throughout life celebrated for the power of bearing fatigue, and to the last indulged in his favourite amuse ment of hunting. The faults of this king, or rather his crimes, have been already His character stated. They were of a very deep dye: but we must be betterment 60 ^'' acquainted than we are at present with his history, before we can pronounce upon the exact degree of their turpitude.

It is possible that * Sit Thomas Herbert. This account is confirmed by a letter from Mr. Burt, dated Gombroon, 6th February, 1627. He observes, ' This king hath added to ' the numberless terrors of his conscience the death of his own and only son, ' causing his eyes to be cut forth with a razor; whose own child was a spectator ' of his father's misery, whom in his rage he bereaved of life, as afterwards did ' unto himself by poisonous pills.' — Public Records, India House,566 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xiv. innumerable lives might have been preserved by a father consenting to be the executioner of an ambitious son. It is not meant to palliate the guilt of Abbas, but to show that the perpetration of such crimes as he committed, is too often the dreadful obligation of that absolute power to which he was born; and it is, therefore, the character of the government, more than that of the despot, which merits our abhorrence. There have been few sovereigns in the universe who have done more substantial good to their country than Abbas the Great. He established an internal tranquillity throughout Persia, that had been unknown for centuries. He put an end to the annual ravages of the Usbegs, and confined these plunderers to their own dominions. He completely expelled the Turks from his native territories, of which they held some of the finest provinces when he ascended the throne. Justice was in general administered according to the laws of religion ; and the king seldom interfered, except to support the law, or to punish those who thought themselves above it. Though possessed of great means, and dis tinguished as a military leader, he deemed the improvement of his own wide possessions a nobler object than the pursuit of con quest: he attended to the cultivation and commerce of Persia beyond all former monarchs, and his plans for effecting his objects were almost all of a nature that showed the greatness of his mind. The bridges, caravansaries, and other useful public buildings, that he erected, were without number. The impression which his noble munificence made upon the minds of his subjects has descended to their children. The modern traveller, who inquires the name of the founder of any ancient building in Persia, receives the ready answer, ' Shah Abbas the Great;' which is given, not from anTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. exact knowledge that he was the founder, but from the habit of considering him as the author of all improvement. We cannot suppose that a prince of this character could delight in cruelty : and to whatever actions the stern dictates of policy, the jealousy of power, the infirmity of age, or the artful intrigues of base flatterers, may have led Abbas in his latter years, we must not hastily consign to execra tion the memory of a monarch, who restored Persia to a condition of greatness beyond what that country had known for ages; who was brave, generous, and wise; and who, during a reign protracted to near half a century, seemed to have no object but that of rendering his kingdom flourishing, and his subjects happy. An eminent and impartial writer* has, in stating one historical fact, furnished us with the noblest eulogy upon the character of Abbas. ' When ' this great prince,' he observes, ' ceased to live, Persia ceased to ' prosper!' * Chardin, Vol. III. page 12.568 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAPTER XV. From the Death of Shah Abbas the Great, till the Conquest of Persia by the Affghans, and the Abdication of Shah Sultan Hussein. chap . xv. The kingdom of Persia had, at different periods, attained more extensive limits, but perhaps was never more prosperous and powerful, than during the latter years of the reign of Abbas the Great. The history of that monarch, and his predecessors, are related by many writers; but we lose these guides a short time after his decease. The author of the work* which I have chiefly followed in the account of this family, lived in the time of Abbas the Second, and closes his Memoirs about the middle of that sove reign's reign; and there are but few Persian histories which give any particular and authentic accounts of the events which took place from that period, till the elevation of Nadir Shah. The causes which have occasioned this chasm in the annals of that country, are obvious. We can hardly imagine an era more unfavourable for a national historian. A period of nearly a century elapsed without the occurrence of any one political event of magnitude; and yet this extraordinary calm was productive of no advantage to Persia. The princes, nobles, and high officers of that kingdom, were, it is true, * Zubd-ul-Tuarikh.lore and the are time iefly bbas ove- anj lace uses , are for a it the t this The true, THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 569 exempt from the dangers of foreign or internal war ; but their chap. xv. property, and their lives, were the sport of a succession of weak, cruel, and debauched monarchs. The lower orders were exposed to fewer evils than the higher, but they became every day more unwar- like; and what they gained by that tranquillity which the state enjoyed, lost almost all its value when they ceased to be able to defend it. This period was distinguished by no glorious achieve ments. No characters arose on which the historian could dwell with delight. The nation may be said to have existed upon the reputation which it had before acquired till all it possessed was gone, and till it became, from the slow but certain progress of a gradual and vicious decay, incapable of one effort to avert that dreadful misery and ruin in which it was involved, by the invasion of a few Affghan tribes; whose conquest of Persia affixed so indelible a disgrace upon that country, that we cannot be surprised that its historians have shrunk from the painful and degrading narration. The task which Persian authors have left undone, has, perhaps, been better executed by foreign writers. The liberal policy of Abbas the Great attracted many Europeans to his dominions. He gave equal encouragement to all classes: and before his death there were, in Persia, political envoys, soldiers, merchants, and mis sionaries, from almost every country in Christendom. The causes which produced this encouragement were, jealousy and hatred of the Turks, a desire of improvement in military tactics, a wish to increase the commerce of the country, and a spirit of religious toleration. These motives continued to operate after this monarch s death, and the most debased and cruel of his successors were kind and generous to the Europeans in their dominions. The consequence vol. 1. 4 d wmk 1 j. 1 mill —h570 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. was, that numbers flocked to Persia; and among these were some meri eminent for science and learning. In their page, we have an ample detail of the events of this period, which is one that should not be passed in silence; for it is more useful to contemplate despotism in its naked deformity, than when half concealed by a veil of glory. The picture may disgust; but that sensation proves that the lesson is conveyed : and the English historian of a nation like Persia, can have no nobler object^ than that of giving a faithful representa tion of scenes, which must, by the contrast they exhibit in the con dition of a great community, render those who live under a just and free government, still more sensible to the value of the greatest of all human blessings. a. d. 1627.

A watch-maker, called Rodolph Stadler, a native of Zorikh, had accompanied the mission from the Duke of Holstein to Persia, and became watch-maker to Suffee. Rodolph slew a Persian, whom he found in his house, and suspected of being too intimate with his wife. He applied to the king, who at first pardoned him, but was afterwards persuaded by his ministers to recall this pardon, unless Rodolph became a Mahomedan. The king was very desirous to effect this object, and, in the most earnest manner, offered Rodolph, if he changed his reli gion, a fortune of ten thousand tomans, and a beautiful wife: but all was in vain, Rodolph would not give up his faith, and the king was reluctantly compelled to let the law have its course. The firm Christian was given over, agreeably to the usage in such cases, to the relations of the man he had slain. They struck off his head, on the last day of October, 1637. His body was, by the king's command, given to the Armenians, who interred it as the corpse of a martyr; and the priests reported, that ano-els were seen, the night qf its interment, hovering round the tomb.— Tavilenieb , Vol. II. page 239. § Chardin.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. Persia, ascribed the cruelties which this prince committed to syste matic policy; and he informs us, that Suffee, by putting to death the chief military nobles of the country, finished what his grandfather, the great Abbas, had begun; and that the desire of both, was to introduce captives and slaves into high offices, in order that they might better reduce and degrade an aristocracy, which had become too powerful to admit of their exercising an uncontrolled and absolute power*. This general observation only appears true in a very modified sense. Abbas made many changes in the system of the government, but he only sought to render himself independent of the powerful khans, or feudal lords, of Persia. Their destruc tion was not his object; on the contrary, he preserved them in great strength, and always deemed them the best defence of his kingdom. He punished and rewarded these nobles, like his other subjects, without fear, and without suspicion. His courage, while it repressed turbulence, inspired attachment. The character of his unworthy grandson was exactly opposite. All his motives were of the basest order. His actions were always to be referred either to his anger, his avarice, his caprice, his jealousy, or his fears. Yet this tyrant, who wa&amp; despised even more than he was dreaded, reigned in peace : but there can be no doubt that he was more indebted for his per sonal safety, during the few years he occupied the throne of Persia, to the reverence in which his family was held, and to the fame and wisdom of his great predecessor, than to the terror which was inspired by his cruelty and oppression. * Tavernier also states, that Abbas had left a secret order to put certain great khans to death, but gives us no authority for this improbable assertioa.576 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv.

Persian princes had been brought up as soldiers till the period of Shah Abbas. The sense which that sovereign appears to have entertained of the danger of that system, led him to direct a change; and subsequent to the death of his sons (whose fate has been related) the princes of the Suffavean dynasty were immured in the haram, and saw only women and eunuchs. A monarch, who was never permitted to leave this prison till he ascended the throne, was likely to be effeminate and inefficient. It was hardly possible that he could resist the intoxication of absolute power. The unlimited indulgence of his passions seemed almost the certain consequence * ' The City of Koom was built in the year of the Hejirah 203, from the ruins of « seven towns, which had composed a small sovereignty, under Abdalrahman, an ' Arabian prince. But this person having been overthrown by his enemies, and his ' country ruined, the inhabitants of the seven towns founded the City of Koom, which « was divided into seven departments, each assuming the name of one of the towns « which had been destroyed.

He gave a ready ear to every informer, and was alike prompt to execute all whom his ministers denounced as dangerous to his power, as he was to destroy those ministers, when their enemies instilled into his weak mind the slightest doubt of their fidelity.

Their frailty, they said, led them to dread a ' water drinker*.^ The fact was, the Christians of this city were remarkable for their indulgence in the use of liquor, and they were justly alarmed at the prospect of being governed by a religious bigot; who would, they knew, consider even the moderate use of wine as a just ground for plunder ing them of their property, if he did not deprive them of life. The king was advised to attend to this petition. His reply stated, that the drunkards of Erivan were quite unworthy of the holy manf whom he had appointed to rule them; and he, therefore, had nominated one (whose character was more suited to such sinners) to that station J.

Persian writers, however, affirm, that the royal feasts were frequently enlivened by wit, and that the king sometimes con descended to smile at the occasional sallies of his companions. He happened to observe, at one of his entertainments, that he had sent an ambassador to India, who had met with so many delays, that he believed he would never come back. ' Let us all agree « to sit here till he returns,' was the reply of the son of a judge, who made one of the assembly*. Though the youth, warm with wine, had forgotten what the laws of prudence demanded. Abbas, we are told, was delighted with a sally which showed so extraordinary an enjoyment of his society. But different scenes were often exhi bited, and the most dissipated nobles dreaded an invitation to drink with their monarch, who was as solicitous to make them exceed, as he was prompt to punish any act of disrespect, which the effects of excess led them to commit.

The vanity of Abbas the Second was gratified by embassies from almost all the nations in Europe, as well as from India, and the remotest regions of Tartary. His country enjoyed complete tranquillity; commerce flourished; and his kindness and attention to strangers attracted vast numbers to his dominions. a. d. 1659. We have a remarkable instance of the generous clemency of Abbas in his conduct to T^hmAr^s Khan, Prince of Georgia, whose life had passed in hostility to him; but who was, when made captive by one of his generals, not only forgiven, but loaded with favours: and the interference of the Persian monarch obtained the release of the grandson of the Georgian ruler, who was a prisoner or hostage with the Emperor of Russia a. d. 1666.

J Chardin states, that he was thirty-eight years of age when he died : but the date of his birth^ as stated by the author of the Zubd-ul-Tuarikh, contradicts this fact, and makes him only thirty-four. 11 The pain, it is said, caused by his disease, was so excruciating, that this prince died in the conviction that he was poisoned. § Both Chardin and Tavernier give us some dreadful instances of his cruelty: but almost all his crimes appear to have been committed when in a state of inebriety.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. from these excesses was in a great degree limited to the circle of his court; the country at large only knew this prince as one of the most generous and just rulers that ever reigned in Persia. To the public officers of government he was severe, but to the poor mild and lenient; and the lives and property of his subjects were efficiently protected. He was as tplerant to all religions as his great an cestor, whose name he had taken. To Christians, indeed, he always showed the most marked favour. He used often to declare the prin ciple by which his conduct on this point was regulated. ' It is for ' God,' (Abbas was wont to observe,) « not for me, to judge of ' men's consciences; and I will never interfere with what belongs to ' the tribunal of the great Creator and Lord of the Universe*.' SufFee-f-, the eldest son of Abbas the Second, was twenty years of age when his father died. He had only one brother, Humzd Meerza, This accounts for the contradictory statements which are given of his character: but this degrading vice, instead of palliating, aggravates his guilt. # Du Cerceau. t The Persian Manuscript, that has been chiefly followed in the preceding history of the monarchs of the Suflfavean dynasty, terminates fourteen years before the death of Abbas the Second; and we meet with no authentic Persian history that details the latter events of this dynasty of monarchs. I obtained a work written by an exiled prince of this family, called Sultan Mahomed Meerza; who, when living in retirement at Lucknow, composed a volume, which professes to be a history of his ancestors : but this work is evidently not very correct; and as it was written more from what its author had heard, than what he knew, it cannot be much depended upon. I deemed myself more fortunate in possessing a small manuscript upon the Affghan invasion of Persia, by Shaikh Mahomed Aly Hazeen, a man of singular piety and learning, who was in Isfahan during the siege, and was an eye-witness of all he describes. He after wards became a voluntary exile from his country, and died in India, at the City of Benares, where his memory is still generally respected.584 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. who was an infant* at that period. This child had accompanied the court, while SufFee had been left at Isfahan, where he was kept close prisoner in the haram; and a report was now spread, and believed, that he had been deprived of sight, and was consequently Determination incompetent to reign. It was under the pretext of crediting this to set aside suffee, the eld- rumour, that the chief officers of government determined, at a general bus. council, which was held on the death of Abbas, to elevate Humzd Meerza to the throne f. It is probable, that their real motive in this proceeding was, to preserve (by giving the crown to a minor) the power in their own hands, and to escape the danger which threat ened them, from the elevation of a prince who had been long rigorously confined, and who, it was likely, would resent the severity with which he had been treated, on all who shared his father's regard and confidence. The prime minister had apparently convinced all the council, by the specious arguments he used, of the expediency and wisdom of this measure; and they were on the point of concerting the mode of carrying their resolution into effect, when their plans were com pletely defeated by the firm loyalty and courageous justice of a man, who, the moment before he opened his lips, was an object of pity and contempt to the whole assembly J.

He waited till all the ministers had delivered their sentiments; and when he saw that they were unanimous in their determination to set aside Suffee, and to elevate his younger brother, he addressed them as follows: — ' I must believe, most noble lords, that the resolution you have Speech of Agi ' adopted is the result of a sudden impulse, and not of your mature ' deliberation. You can never, if you reflect, commit an act so con- ' trary to justice, and the laws of our holy prophet, as that you have ' proposed. But you have hitherto only listened to the specious ' reasons for this act. Why has the true motive been concealed ? ' Is not the real object to obtain the government of this kingdom ? ' That is the cause why you desire to raise a child to the throne! ' You say that his elder brother is, perhaps, dead, or at all events ' deprived of sight. He is neither: he lives, he sees. My head shall ' answer for the truth of this assertion. Had it been otherwise, the ' event could not have been concealed from me: besides, would not ' the deceased king, had he ever intended Humzei Meerza for his suc- ' cessor, have increased his establishment ? Should I, who have the ' sole charge of that prince, and his dignified mother, have been ' excluded from this important secret ? But he never, for one ' moment, cherished this intention: and if you invest the younger ' brother with the rights of the elder, you will commit at once ' injustice and treason. If there must be a sacrifice to preserve the ' peace of the state, let it be the younger. Do you not perceive vol. i. 4 f586 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. ' that you will throw the kingdom into confusion ? Do you expect « that the other nobles of Persia have as little consideration for law ' and justice as you have? Will the people at large consent to ' share the great crime which you commit; which they must do, if ' they grant you their support ? All will abhor you: and Humz4 ' Meerza will one day consider you as men, who elevated him only ' to serve the purposes of your own ambition; and who, to forward ' that object, were false to your king, to your prophet, and your ' God*.' Here he stopped for a moment; and then, with increased agitation, exclaimed, ' Humza Meerza! Humzd Meerza ! to what ' an extremity am I reduced! Do you, great lords of this empire, ' desire that I should strangle that innocent prince with these hands ' that have reared him ? Is it your wish that I should bring his ' corpse to your assembly ? I have the power to commit this act of ' horror; and it appears the only means by which I can compel you ' to do justice. You will then be forfced to carry the crown to him ' to whom it belongs : judge how he will reward you, when he learns ' the dreadful extreme by which you were reduced to the necessity ' of placing him upon the thronef!' He quitted the assembly at the same moment that he finished his speech; and, retiring to the interior of the palace, left the first nobles of the empire looking at each other with surprise and horror. They could not divine the motive by which Aga MooMruk was actuated. They knew that he doated on Humz4 Meerza, and that he had every thing to expect from that prince's advance ment; while he could entertain no hopes from the elevation of * Chardin, Vol. IV. page 226, 227. t Chardin, Vol. IV. page 227.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. o87 Suffee Meerza, with whom he was not connected by any ties chap . xv. whatever. It could, therefore, be only a high sense of loyalty, a regard for justice, and a desire to promote the welfare of his country, which had inspired him with such eloquence and resolu tion. A conviction of the exalted nature of his motives aided the impression which the truth and justice of his sentiments had made upon the minds of all present: and, after a long silence, the prime minister observed, that as Aga Moob^ruk had assured them the Prince SufFee was alive, and had not been deprived of sight, it would certainly be proper to raise him to the throne^. The others assented: and Suffee, who on his accession to the throne took the suffee Meerza title of Solim&amp;n, owed his crown and life to the fidelity and virtue of jhe'throne t0 an eunuch, whom he early rewarded with marks of signal favour. a . n , d ta . ke ® the o title of Shall He desired, it is said, to promote him to high employ, but Aga SoIiu ^ n - Moob^ruk declined the distinction..

He was a weak, unwarlike, and dissolute prince, ment. 20 6 '' whose time was divided between his haram and the pleasures of the table. The Usbegs renewed their annual invasions of Khorassan. The shores of the Caspian suffered by the predatory incursions of the Tartars of Kapchack; and one of the principal islands-f* in the Gulf was seized by the Dutch. The pusillanimity with which Solimdn suffered these attacks, not only met with advocates among flatterers of his own country, but is praised by a learned and respect- * Chardin, Vol. IV, page £28, + The Island of Kishmah.588 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xv. able European traveller*, who was in Persia when this prince sat upon the throne, and who ascribes the conduct of Soliindn to wisdom and good policy. If such forbearance is entitled to the meed of glory, no person was ever more deserving of it than this weak and tyrannical prince, who was an object of dread to none but the slaves of his power. One of the greatest favourites of Solimdn was a chief called Aly Kooli Khan, who was brave and generous, but volatile and impru dent. He had, during the reign of Abbas, been general^ in prison, unless when his services were required against the enemies of his country f. This had acquired him the name of' the Lion of Persia;^ as men said, that he was always chained, except when wanted to fight. The moment this chief learned that Solimdn had succeeded to the throne, he contrived to make his escape from confinement, and presented himself at court; where, by the aid of some friends, he rose rapidly into power ; and, from his gay humour, and love of dis sipation, soon became the declared favourite of the young monarch. The terms upon which Aly Kooli lived with his sovereign, may be conceived by the following anecdote. Solim^n happened one day to observe, that he had heard there were persons who rejoiced at the death of his father; and added, that if he could discover them, they should be punished most severely. The favourite replied, laughing, ' I know none that have the least cause to rejoice at that melancholy ' event, except your mother and me. We certainly have, for we « were prisoners, and now enjoy the government of Persia/' The king smiled at this sally, and, pretending to reprove his folly, called * Kempfer. •f* Tavernier, Vol. II. page 287.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. him a madman. This humorous lord was, however, neither desti tute of humanity nor sense, and in many instances his influence over his master was exerted for good purposes: but his expenditure always far exceeded his income; and he was, in consequence, both venal and rapacious. A minister of the highest character had, at one period, by his knowledge of public affairs, and his great respectability, obtained the confidence, if not the favour of Solim^n: but the virtuous and religious Shaikh Aly Khan* was, perhaps, more employed from necessity than choice. His severe integrity, and unbending austerity, continually reproached the prince for his intemperancef. Solimdn one day, when he was enjoying himself in a convivial party, sent for his minister, and plainly told him, that he could no longer suffer his extreme prudence and sobriety. ' You must relax sometimes,' said he, ' or we can never agree/' The minister replied, that he lived as became his age and character. ' Very true,' said Solimdn; ' but ' your conduct is my reproach, and I can no longer endure it. You must get drunk with us immediately, either with wine, or a pre- * This minister was of the tribe of Zung§.nah. Some of his lineal descendants are living at Kermanshah.

' paration of opium. Choos© which 3^011 like best: but the dose ' must be swallowed. It is the command of your king, who will ' be obeyed.' Remonstrances were in vain. Shaikh Aly Khan swallowed a preparation of opium, and soon fell down senseless from intoxication*. The triumph of the king over the virtue of his minister knew no bounds. The expression of his joy was extra vagant : he called all his court to view the grave, the sober Shaikh Aly Khan extended upon the ground: and, to complete the scene, lie ordered the old man's beard to be shaved, and then sent him to his home. The public officers went next morning to tell Shaikh Aly Khan that the court was assembled; but the minister, enraged at the affront which had been offered him, bade them go and say, he considered himself as disgraced, and would not attend. The king tried, but in vain, to alter his resolution; and it is to the honour of his understanding, that every day made him more sensible of the loss he had sustained. About four months afterwards, Solimdn had, in a fit of inebriety, commanded that the hands of a musician should be cut off. A favourite officer-f, to whom this order was given, ventured to disobey it, in the belief that it was the mere effect of excessive drunkenness. This monarch had fallen asleep; but when he awoke, and found the same musician playing, he became furious, and directed that not only his hands and feet, but those of the favourite, by whose disobedience he had been saved, should be taken off, The interference of one of the principal officers of the court, only caused his being included in the same terrible sentence; the execution of which was on the point of commencing, when # Chardin, Vol. I. page 307. t Nasser Aly Beg, son of the Governor of Erivan.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 591 Shaikh Alj Khan rushed forward, and, throwing himself at the feet chap of the king, begged for mercy* ' You are very bold,- said Solimdn; ' you continue to slight my earnest entreaties that you should « again serve me, and yet you intercede for others/'—« I am your « slave,' said the minister, ' and ready to obey all your com- 44 mands.' ' Very well,' said Solim^n, ' I forgive them all on « your account. Resume your office, and I will promise, in future ' to respect both you and myself more than I have done.' It is even stated that the king vowed to abandon wine: but his resolution, if he ever took it, was soon broken, and he returned to his former habits. We may form a judgment of the habits of this prince, by the expressions used by the East India Company's agent at Isfahan. ' The king,' this gentleman observes, in a letter to his employers, ' still continues his excess in wine, which makes me fear, when I ' next address myself to him, he will command me to play the ' good fellow, and very probably be desirous of proving our « European wine, which, if it be good, may be acceptable to ' him; therefore, request the supplying me with three chests; ' one sack, one claret, one rhenish, of the very best, to present ' himf.'

He had been long afflicted by illness: but Soliman - though he was, at one period, many years without coming out of * Chardin, Vol. I. page 307. t Gombroon Records, 27th Nov. 1672.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. his haram *, the country remained in as great tranquillity as if it had been ruled by an active and energetic monarch. This weak and dissipated prince appears to have always placed implicit confidence in the favourite of the moment: and his confinement, during the latter years of his rule, in the haram, where he could only see women and eunuchs, enabled the latter to obtain a complete influence over his mind, which they exercised in a manner that disgusted all the high nobles and chief officers of the government: but those classes of the inhabitants of Persia who were unconnected with an effeminate and cruel court, were subject to no particular evils during this reign; and though the general spirit of the nation declined, it was in a manner too gradual to be perceived, or to produce any effect on the public tranquillity. The splendour of Solim^nsf court equalled that of the most magnificent of his predecessors. Strangers were encouraged and protected; and foreigners + from every quarter of the globe, but particularly Europe, resorted to Persia. It has been before stated, that it is chiefly to these we are indebted for the facts which we possess relative to this period of Persian history. All the important events * MSS.

He became a partner in a commercial house at Petersburgh, and went from that into Persia: the loss of some goods led him to the Court of Nadir Shah, with whose history and character he became intimately acquainted. He also made himself master of all the events that had preceded that tyrant's usurpation. In 1753, when he retired to England, he pub lished his Travels. He was the author of several other works. Both his writings and his actions show that he was a man of extraordinary activity of mind, and of the most singular virtue and benevolence. He was the chief founder of the Marine Society. The Magdalen Charity, which was projected by his partner, Mr. Dingley, was prin cipally indebted to his active virtue for its establishment. To him may be traced many of our best parish regulations that relate to the care of children ; and the first establishment of Sunday schools originated with Jonas Hanway. His efforts to do good were eminently successful, because all his projects were practical, and every class of his poor countrymen were objects of his benevolence. He endeavoured to alle viate the condition of chimney-sweepers, a race too generally despised. It is to the honour of the merchants of London, that they evinced their respect and veneration for this excellent man, by the most uncommon mark of attention.

The latter writer was fully competent to judge of the fidelity of this work; and he would never have given the authority of his name to falsehood, or misrepresentation; for he was alike distinguished by a spirit of useful enterprise, a regard for religion, a love of truth, and an extensive knowledge of the manners and history of the various countries through which he travelled. We are told, that when Solim&amp;n was dying, he said to those by whom he was surrounded*, ' If yon desire ease, elevate Hussein ' Meerza.

The king acted, on all these points, at the suggestion of one of the prin cipal Mahomedan priests*, of whose character we may judge, when informed f that he persuaded his sovereign to issue an order, (a few days after he ascended the throne,) not only to cast away all the wine and the rose water which his father possessed, but to break the polluted vessels which had contained these forbidden and luxurious liquids. He also prevailed upon Hussein to persecute all sectaries: and among these the principal were the Sooffees, a class of philosophical Deists^, to which several of his ancestors had belonged. The measures of Hussein were calculated to destroy what little spirit remained in the nation. High nobles gave place, with feelings of resentment, to eunuchs and priests: but their dis content was only vented in complaints; and it was, perhaps, one of the most dangerous symptoms of the condition of Persia, that the conduct of its weak and superstitious monarch provoked neither opposition nor revolt.

But it is time to give some account of that race, who throwing off the shackles in which they had been long bound, awoke Persia from a fatal dream of security, and retorted upon that nation all the injuries which they had sustained from the tyranny of its oppressive governors. Origin and The origin of the Affghan tribes *, who inhabit the mountainous oftheAffghan tract between Khorassan and the Indus, is variously traced, by different historians. Some assert, that this people are lineally descended from the Jewish tribes, made prisoners by Nebuchad- nezzarf; and the principal chiefs are said to trace their families * The author of a manuscript History of the Affghans, in my possession, observes, that some derive the name AfFghan from the Persian signification of that term, which ''g means ' lamentation.' It was applied because these tribes bewailed their banishment 80 § from Judea. Others say that AfFghan was the grandson of Saul, and was employed hiss by Solomon in building the temple. This author refers to two histories of this nation; » the Tarikh Affghanah, and the Tarikh Ghour; i. e. the History of the Affghans, and the 'W History of Ghour. It appears, he says, from these works, that the Affghans consider illusi themselves as partly descended from the Copts of Egypt, and partly from the Israelites; but no facts are adduced to support this assertion. poss f We are told by one of these writers, that Nebuchadnezzar, after putting to death prov many of the prisoners, banished them into the mountains of Ghour, where they multi- I sra( plied greatly, and soon became masters of the country into which they had been sent. | . ^ They maintained a correspondence with the Jews in Arabia; and when those changed p ns j their religion for that of Mahomed, a letter was received from a converted Jew, called ^ Khalud, informing them of the appearance of a new prophet, and invoking them to join his holy standard. Several Affghan nobles went to Arabia; the principal was Keis, who, we are informed by Affghan authors, traced his descent through forty-seven is v mai Per to | trad yet g® duce Keis that seen tbe[ aftei *THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. to David, and to Saul*. Though their right to this proud descent chap. is very doubtful, it is evident, from their personal appearance, and many of their usages, that they are quite a distinct race from the Persians, Tartars, and Indians; and this circumstance alone seems to give some appearance of credibility to a statement, which is con tradicted by many strong factsf, and of which no direct proof has yet been produced. generations to Saul, and in fifty-five to Abraham. This chief, with others, was intro duced by Khalud to the prophet, who condescended to treat them (but particularly Keis,) with great favour: he bestowed on that chief the title of'Abdool Rusheed,'and that of Malik, or 'ruler,' a name to which Mahomed said he was fully entitled, as the de scendant of the ruler of Israel. These chiefs, after they became Mahomedans, accompanied the prophet to the attack of Mecca, and were distinguished by their zeal and valour. Keis, after this, returned to his native country, blessed with the prayers of tlie prophet, and accompanied by some inhabitants of Medina, who were meant to aid him in propagat ing the faith he had learnt in Arabia, to the mountaineers of Ghour. His success was so great, that before his death, which occurred in the fortieth year of the Hejirah, all his subjects were converts. This chief died at the age of eighty-seven, leaving three sons, to whom much of his power and influence descended. His memory is still revered. Every modern chief of Affghanistan endeavours to trace his descent to the illustrious Keis. — History of the Affghans, Persian MSS, * Almost all Mahomedan writers claim this descent for the Affghans; and I possessed, for some time, a genealogical table, in which an attempt was made to prove all the principal families of Affghanistan direct descendants of the kings of Israel. t There is no affinity whatever to be traced between the Hebrew tongue and the Pushtoo, or modern language of the Affghans; and there have been no inscriptions discovered which tend to support a belief of their being of Jewish extraction. Their own vague traditions of their origin cannot be admitted as conclusive facts upon such a subject.598 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. There is no doubt that the Affghan tribes were converted at a ver y early date to the Mahomedan religion. Their condition, from the first periods of which we have any authentic records of their history, has undergone very little change. Their chiefs have always been more anxious for personal independence than for the strength of the government under which they lived; and their followers have enjoyed a savage freedom, which made them hostile to every effort to reduce the clans into one mass, which it was obvious could never be effected without a subversion of that order of society in which they were born, and in which they gloried. It cannot be surprising that a nation so constituted should have been unable to resist any formidable attack ; and we find that the Affghans made hardly any opposition to Mahmood of Ghizni, to Chenghiz, or Timour, and that their country was long divided between the monarchs of India and Persia, but they were always turbulent and dangerous subjects. They had triumphed over the ruins of the noble City of Ghizni, and a family of their chiefs had sat upon the throne of Delhi *. The next country doomed to fall by their arms was Persia; but, before their conquest of that country is described, a few words will be necessary to explain the causes which produced so extraordinary an event. The tribes of The Affghans of the tribe of Ghiljee and Abddllee became Abdluee Te- subjects of Persia when Abbas the Great took possession of Can- of'persia^ 6013 dahar.

Ahmed, were sent to Isfahan. The eloquent remonstrances of the * In a small MS. written by Meerza Syud Mahomed, of Isfahan, (late ambassador from Sclnd to the Governor-General of India,) there is the following passage regarding the Seedoozehis: ' In the time of the Suffavean kings of Persia the Affghans were often oppressed; ' and on one occasion they were so discontented with their Persian governor, that ' they sent a secret deputation to Isfahan to solicit his removal, and the appointment ' of one of their own tribe. Their request was granted ; and two of the tribe of ' Abd&amp;llee were raised to the office of Reish Suffeed, or Kut-khodah of the tribes, ' and their authority was confirmed by a royal patent. The name of these two ' persons was Seedoo, of the family of Bimeezehi, from whom Ahmed Shah, the ' founder of the present royal family of Cabul, is lineally descended. The name ' of the other was Ahmed, of the family of Bareekzehi, from whom the present ' Affghan chiefs, Serafraz Khan and Futteh Khan, are descended. The Affghans ' were delighted with this arrangement, and granted their entire and respectful ' obedience to the chief appointed by the Persian government. Time has con- ' firmed this respect; and the superiority of the chiefs so selected has become an ' inheritance to their family. The race of Seedoo obtained sovereignty, while that ' of Ahmed has only gained high station and command. The Seedoozehis (or ' descendants of Seedoo,) are held in such veneration, that if one of them was ' to attempt the murder of an ameer, or lord of another tribe, it would be con- ' sidered wrong to obtain safety by assaulting the Seedoozehis. If an Affghan ' acted otherwise, he would be deemed an outcast in his own class or tribe. ' There is, however, an exception to this rule in favour of the descendants of ' Ahmed; and the Ahmedzehis may, without sacrilege, slay a Seedoozehi; but a ' great number of the Affghans deny this privilege even to the Ahmedzehis. Seedoo &lt;( and Ahmed (this author adds,) were raised to rank by Shah Abbas the Great, &lt;( and derived their fortunes from that fountain of dignity and splendour,' t At present this tribe is called Door&amp;nee, a name given to it by Ahmed Shah; who, in consequence of the dream of a saint, assumed the title of Douree Dooran, which may be translated, ' The age of fortune,' and called his tribe Doorcinee.600 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. former were heard ; and he rose so high in the estimation of Abbas, that he not only granted his request, but nominated him elder*, Seedoo, of the _ . . tribe of Ab- or magistrate, of his tribe; and by a written mandate ordained d^llee, at- i i &gt; i • j • tains great that his person should be held sacred, and his authority respected -f*. The gratitude of his countrymen gave full effect to the intentions of the king; and that respect and obedience which was granted to Seedoo became the inheritance of his direct descendants. These His descend- are called Seedoozehi, or sons of Seedoo, and are considered by Seedoozehi 'r' all the Affghans as a sacred branch of the tribe of Abdallee, against whom it is impious to lift a sword, and on whom retaliation even for murder is not lawful J. The tranquillity which the liberal policy of Abbas had established was of short duration, and his successors were engaged in constant disputes and wars with the sovereigns of India about the posses sion of Affghanistan. The rude tribes of that mountainous region, though they were of the Soonee persuasion, are said to have preferred submission to the Sheah monarchs of Persia, to dependence on the proud and luxurious Court of Delhi. The reason of this preference (if it existed,) must have been the comparative laxity of the Persian sway. But the fact is, the Affghan tribes were generally able to maintain a considerable degree of independence by balancing between these two powerful states. * The terms used by the Persian authors are Reish SufFeed and Kut-khodah. The former means elder; the latter, magistrate. The title of Reish SufFeed, or elder, exclusively belongs to those who preside over branches of tribes. Kut-khodah is the common appellation for the magistrate of a ward in a city, or the head of a small town or village. t MSS. of Meerza Syud Mahomed. x Some deviations from this superstitious respect to the Seedoozehis have recently occurred, but they are regarded with horror by the whole nation.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. The Ghiljee Affghans*, who had long been settled in the vicinity of Candahar, had often shown a disposition to revolt; and it was believed that at this period the Court of Delhi cherished hopes to regain, through their means, possession of the country they inhabited. The ministers of Sultan Hussein were at a loss what step they should take to check this spirit of insurrection, but at last resolved on the expedient of appointing Goorgeen Khan, the Waly or Prince of Georgia, to the government of Candahar; and they at the same time determined not only to give him ample means of suppressing domestic rebellion, but to meet any foreign danger which might threaten that quarter of Persiaf. This prince was justly deemed one of the ablest and bravest military leaders in Goorgeen Khan ap pointed to the government of Candahar, to check the in surrection of the tribe of Ghiljee. Goorgeen Khan marched to take possession of his government with an army composed of twenty thousand Persians, and a select body of his own countrymen. The intelligence of his approach at the head of so large a force, put an end to every appearance of revolt. But he was not satisfied with this submission, and He marches with an army of twenty thousand men * All we know of the early history of the Ghiljee tribe is, that they ventured to plunder part of the baggage of the army of Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni, and were almost wholly extirpated by that powerful monarch. They are again mentioned during the reign of Timour, and appear to have then regained some strength: and when Shah Sultan Hussein ascended the Throne of Persia, they were the most formidable of all the tribes of western Affghans. They lived in tents, and almost all their pasture lands were in the vicinity of Candahar. f Krusinski's Memoir, page 151. J Goorgeen Khan had attempted to establish an independent power in Georgia, but was forced to submit; and Sultan Hussein pardoned him, on the ground of his having renounced the Christian for the Mahomedan religion. vol. i. 4 h602 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAP. XV. His severe treatment of the Affghans. They apply for his re moval. But are un successful. Goorgeen Khan shows his resent ment. proceeded to punish the Affghans as severely as if they had carried their designs into execution. The Persian troops were allowed to treat them as a conquered enemy; and neither rank, age, nor sex, was a protection from their violence*. The cruel oppression under which they suffered, led them to send several secret missions to Isfahan, to complain of the new governor: but they found it difficult to obtain access to the king: and when their petition for redress was at last presented, the friends of Goorgeen Khan suc ceeded in persuading Sultan Hussein that they were malecontents who merited no attention, A harsh answer was given : and the disappointed deputies returned to their native province, where they imparted the indignation, which the conduct of the weak monarch had kindled in their breasts, to those of their countrymen. The Georgian prince, who was well informed of all these pro ceedings, took the first opportunity of showing his resentment. Among the nobles of the tribe of Ghiljee who had signed the petition to the king, Meer Vais was the most powerful-f. He added to the station he had enjoyed from birth, (that of chief of a large branch of the tribe,) the high office of Kalanter, or principal magistrate of the City of Candahar; and his power and influence were increased by his character, which was very popular, on account of his gracious and winning manners, and his extraordi nary liberality. This nobleman, Goorgeen concluded, (and probably with truth,) had been the principal mover of all the representations to the king. He selected him, therefore, as a proper example; * Hanway, Vol. II. page 102. t The Ghiljee are subdivided into several branches, from five to ten thousand each branch.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 603 and on some slight pretext he made him prisoner, and sent him chap. xv. to Isfahan He wrote at the same time to the ministers, to inform them that the future peace of Candahar depended upon ^kln^nd' their keeping in confinement this powerful and ambitious leader. seuttoIsfahai1 But he should have known the court he served better than to have trusted within its precincts so dangerous a character as Meer Vais. That artful and able chief soon became acquainted with the His intrigues weakness of Sultan Hussein, and the corruption of his divided coun- atcourt ' sellers, and he intrigued with such success, that his cause was taken up bj the enemies of Goorgeen Khan, and the most favourable opportunities afforded him of stating all his personal grievances, as well as those of his tribef*. His cunning and eloquence overcame the judgment of the monarch, while his wealth enabled him to bribe the ministers: and the degraded captive was suddenly elevated into where he be- a court favourite. He might at this period, (if that had been his sole ^ object,) have returned with honour to his native country; but he had seen enough of Persia to make him cherish greater designs. The chief obstacle to the plans of Meer Vais was the character of Goorgeen Khan : he could expect no success while that brave and experienced ruler held his command. To subvert him, there fore, all his efforts were directed; and he succeeded so far, as to create the most alarming jealousy of the designs of that noble man. But Meer Vais had too much prudence to precipitate his measures. He was desirous that every suspicion of his real motives should pass away, that he might more safely execute his purpose; and, with this view, he requested leave to make a pilgrimage Krusinski's Memoir, page 154. f Hamvay, Vol. II. page 105.604 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. Mecca, where he secretly obtained Fetw&amp;hs, or religious decrees, from the principal Soonee doctors at that holy shrine, declaring, that it was lawful and pious to make war upon and to destroy all Sheahs; a sect, whom these orthodox priests had long deemed the worst of infidels^. It was the future exposition of these decrees which developed all the plans that he had formed at the period of his confinement in Persia. Betumssto WhenMeerVais returned from Mecca, his designs were promoted by a very extraordinary occurrence, which peculiarly illustrates the its wea\ and weak and credulous character of the Court of Persia. The Emperor racte' 1 . 011301 a of Russia had appointed an adventurer of the name of Israel Orii, a h 1120! ambassador to the King of Persia. This person, who was an Armenian, and had recommended himself by a knowledge of the oriental languages, and some diplomatic services in Turkey, had solicited and obtained, from Peter the Great, the conduct of an embassy to Persia. This was granted as a reward for past services, and included many privileges; among which was, a remission of customs upon all articles of merchandise carried by the ambassador, and by those in his train-f-. Orii, who considered this privilege as one by which he might enrich himself and his friends, admitted into his train several hundred followers, many of whom were his countrymen : and a motive of idle vanity, connected with a desire to increase his personal importance, led him, when he entered Persia, to spread a report that he was descended from the ancient kings of Armenia J. This boasted descent, his numerous attendants, and the character * Krusinski's Memoir, page 172. % Hanway, Vol. II. page 107* f Krusinski's Memoir, page 174.THE HISTOTIY OF PERSIA. 605 of the Emperor of Russia, gave Meer Vais an opportunity of chap. xv. alarming the courtiers*, and through them, their weak monarch. He artfully hinted at a great combination of Christians to seize Armenia and Georgia. Goorgeen Khan was always described as the heart and soul of this plan ; and his great power, and personal character, gave a colour to these representations. Though nothing could be more absurd than the alarm Avhich the Court of Persia had taken, it operated as the Affghan chief had foreseen. It instilled a settled jealousy of the Georgian prince, and fear alone prevented his immediate removal from Candahar: but the advisers of Hussein, who dreaded an act of open hostility against a leader of his rank and reputation, had recourse to the expedient of restoring Meer Vais to all his former situations-f, Meer vais is that he might be a check on his ambition. The indignant governor, foJm^sTtua- though he permitted the Affghan lord to resume his former stations, tlons ' resolved to show that he defied the power of those by whom his slanderer had been protected; and he was, upon this occa sion, led by the violence of his temper to a course more dan gerous to himself, than any other he could have adopted.

The artful Affghan pretended to have forgotten all that had passed; and in a few months Goorgeen Khan placed such confidence in his former enemy, that he accepted an invitation to a sumptuous entertain- who invites ment, which Meer Vais had prepared for him at a garden-house, situated at some distance from the city. The impatient chief had entertainment long desired revenge; and his injuries were deemed sufficient to justify the breach of every bond of hospitality, as well as of faith. The governor, and all his attendants, were murdered at this feast: At which he and the Affghans, clothed in their garments, and led by their daring Ltdalm'^re leader, who was attired in the robes and mounted on the horse of T ' d T toq Goorgeen Khan, moved in a slow procession towards the Fort of A - H - 1121 - Candahar*. It was dark before they reached that fortress; and the deception was not discovered till they were within the town, and had commenced a furious attack upon the garrison. The surprise was MeerVais complete; and victory was rendered secure, by the rise of the IttacLThe Affghans within the fort, and the arrival of parties which had been caTdahar! stationed near it. The inhabitants were told, that if they remained within their houses, and permitted no Persian soldiers to enter them, their lives and property should be preserved. By this means, the troops of Goorgeen Khan, who had no retreat, were almost all put to the sword. A party of six hundred Georgian horse, who had accompanied their prince from his native province, happened, when this event occurred, to be absent on an expedition. Three days afterwards Hanway, Vol. II. page 113.608 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. they returned, laden with booty, and were on the point of entering Candahar, when a discharge of cannon and musqnetry from the walls of the city apprised them that it had changed masters. Meer Vais sallied out, at the head of five thousand horse, to attack them: but that chief was soon taught the difference between his new levies and old soldiers. The Georgians repulsed all his attacks ; and though these were continued for many days, this brave band of warriors, after suffering the greatest hardships, and perform ing almost incredible deeds of valour*, effected their retreat into Khorassan. Their arrival, and the reports propagated of the numbers and ferocity of the Affghans, increased the dismay which the revolution of Candahar had spread over Persia. Meer Vais took every step that a wise man could- to establish himself firmly in that power which he had usurped. He called on his own tribe to show, by their valour and good order, that they were worthy of that freedom which they had obtained. He not only promised, but gave the most efficient protection to all the other inhabitants of the city and province of Candahar; and while he invited them to join him in the attempt to throw off the yoke of an * Hanway gives several particulars of the conduct of this gallant body of Geor gians ; who, he asserts, slew two thousand of their pursuers.

He further proclaimed, that all who were insensible to the benefits that awaited them from the esta blishment of national independence, might depart, and seek that tyranny to which they were devoted. The weak Court of Isfahan, instead of sending an army to subdue The Court of this dangerous insurgent, deputed an ambassador to persuade him to fnaZbtssa- 65 submission. But Mahomed Jdmee Khan, who was employed on this vTisT Meer occasion, was stopt short in his pompous harangue by the Affghan chief. ' Dost thou imagine,' exclaimed Meer Vais, ' that wisdom ' dwells only with effeminacy, and hath never passed the rugged ' mountains with which this kingdom is surrounded ? Let thy king ' raise or let fall his arm as he, pleases, if he were as formidable as ' thou sayest he is, it would be with deeds, not empty words, he ' would oppose our just designs/' After this speech he ordered the ambassador to be put in prison, with the twofold view of The ambassa- preventing his intrigues, and of making an irreconcileable breach soLd. mpn between his tribe and the government of Persia*.

Mahmood, the eldest son of Meer Vais, though quite a youth, was distinguished for that openness of heart and fierce spirit which always recommends a leader to barbarians. He soon discovered that the hatred which he cherished against his uncle, whom he deemed an usurper of his birthright, had (from what had passed since the latter was raised to power,) become a very general sentiment among his countrymen. Trusting to the operation of this feeling for a justifica tion of the deed he purposed, he selected forty friends, and having f j** 11. i .loua seized the palace, entered the chamber of Meer Abdullah, and with his own hand put an end to the existence of that ruler.

The tribes of Kurdistan, who profess the former faith, had carried their predatory ravages as far as the walls of Isfahan. The Usbegs invaded Khorassan, and having combined with AzddtiMh, the chief of the Abd^llee AfFghans*, subdued and plundered almost the whole of that province.

The Persian army had a park of artillery in which there was but little order or discipline. In the confusion of the battle, the gunners mistook a body of their own cavalry for the enemy. Those on whom they fired knew the Alfghans had no cannon, and imputed to treachery what was the effect of error. This event not only checked their career, but caused a confusion in their ranks, which the enemy took advantage of to make a general and successful charge. The Persians fled in every ThePersia„s direction, and were pursued to a great distance. They lost their aredefeated ' general, his son, eight thousand men, twenty pieces of cannon, and all their baggage. This great advantage was dearly gained; for AzadtiMh left three thousand of the bravest of his tribe upon the field. but the success fixed his power and independence; and the AbdMlee Affghans of Herat became almost as formidable to the power of Sultan Hussein, as the Ghiljees of Candahar. While these dangers threatened the north-eastern frontier of the kingdom, it had become necessary to collect a force in the southern provinces to endeavour to recover the islands in the Gulf, of which the Arabian ruler of Muscat had made himself master. The alliance of the Portuguese government of Goa had been courted to effect this object: but their fleet, formerly accustomed only to triumph, had been defeated by the Arabs: and the Persian general, LootfAly a.d . mo. Khan, disappointed of the aid of a naval equipment, remained near A ' H ' 1133 ' Bunder Abbas, which, with all the coast of Persia, it had become necessary to defend with strong garrisons against the attacks of the freebooters of the opposite shore, whom success had rendered bold and enterprising.gjg THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. It was at this period of general weakness and misfortune that Mahmood determined upon the invasion of Persia. He resolved to A.IL1133. penetrate that country by the province of Kerman, preferring a Mahmood marc h over t he desert of Seistan to the obstacles which presented determines on the invasion of themselves in every other direction. Though he took every pre caution to surmount the difficulties of this march, he lost many men and horses: but his appearance was so unexpected, and his force so Kerman sub- considerable, that the city and province of Kerman immediately mits to him. to his arms * This ready acknowledgment of his authority did not save the inhabitants from suffering the most intolerable oppression: and it was with joy they learnt that Lootf Aly Khan had left the sea coast and was hastening to their relief. Mahmood is That chief, who had collected a considerable force, attacked and obUged d tofly d defeated the AfFghan prince, and compelled him to fly to Candahar. Kerman, however, was only exposed, by this victory, to a repetition of what it had before suffered; and when Lootf Aly Khan marched from that province, it was difficult to say whether the invasion of the Affghans, or the advance of the Persian army to their relief, had been most ruinous to its inhabitants. Lootf Aly Khan, who expected that Mahmood would return, adopted every measure to oppose him. He assembled a very strong and well equipped army at Shiraz. But the excesses in which either laxity of discipline, or necessity, had led him to indulge his troops, and the heavy contributions of cattle and provisions which he was compelled to make, raised a host of enemies against him. Their representations and intrigues succeeded: an order was sent to * Hanway, Vol. II. p. 12Q.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 617 remove him from his command: and his dismissal* was the signal chap . xv. for the dispersion of his army. * The disgrace of Lootf Aly Khan was connected with that of his brother, Futteh Aly Khan, the prime vizier, which merits mention, as it is characteristic of the wretched Court of Isfahan and its weak monarch. The plot against this minister was formed and executed by the principal Moollah, or high priest of the empire, and chief physi- cian, who broke upon the slumbers of the king at the dead of night, and told him there was a conspiracy against his life. They showed him a forged letter with the royal seal upon it, which, they pretended, was from Futteh Aly Khan to the Waly of Kurdistan; and the contents of which proved a design to subvert the government next day. Hussein was not merely alarmed ; his fears, for a period, deprived him of reason: when he came to himself, he ordered the minister to be slain; but those who seized him, commenced by depriving him of sight, and were, we are told, inflicting tortures upon him in order to make him discover his treasures when the day broke, but without discovering one of the three thousand Kurds, who were, agreeably to the forged letter, to have attacked Teheran before sunrise,. Shah Hussein, to whom this circumstance was made known, began to suspect he had been deceived, and gave orders to save the life and heal the wounds of Futteh Aly Khan, whose trial, he directed, should be immediately entered upon: and a general council of all the nobles of the court was assembled for the purpose. The charges were three: —That he had invited the Kurds to seize the king; that he had held a secret communication with the Lesghees, to whom, as a Soonee, he was attached; and that he had been heard to declare, when standing near the tomb of Shah Solim&amp;n, that he would revenge the death of his father, whom that prince had slain, by the death of Shah Hussein, his son, and all the royal family. This minister, who boasted a descent from the ancient kings of D£ighestan, made an able defence. The loss of sight, which rendered him indifferent to life, gave a boldness that added to his eloquence; and he not only fully acquitted himself, but retorted upon his enemies in a way that satisfied the king of the vile manner in which his confidence had been abused: but all the justice which the weak Hussein had the courage to show his minister, was to weep over his misfortunes.-^ Hanavay , Vol. II. page 133. vol. i. 4 k ■■■■■■pi618 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. The year ensuing that on which this general was disgraced, was marked by events which spread a general gloom over the whole A. d.1721; i ^ • i i a. h . 1134. kingdom. An ambassador had arrived from Constantinople; and, ambassador before the purport of his mission was known, all was consternation. tin™pie° nStan It was concluded that he came to demand some fragment of the falling state: and the court showed a joy, on finding this suspicion groundless, which testified the extent of their weakness and alarm The Lesghees, who had been saved, by the impolitic lenity of the king, from the fury of the Waly f of Georgia, whose hostility they had provoked, attacked Shirwan, and, after ravaging the open coun try, took the Town of Sh^m^kee, put a great number of the inha- a. d. 1721. bitants to death, and plundered the remainder.

This army had no cannon; but it was furnished with a description of ordnance, or swivels, called zumbooruk*, which were mounted on camels. These, though often useful in action, could make no impression on the slightest walls, and were therefore not likely to be of any service in the great siege he proposed undertaking with this inadequate force. Isfahan stands upon the northern bank of the river Zainderood. Description of It is encompassed by a wall, and is defended toward the south by fahan, and its the river, which in the spring, the period at which Mahmood ^ ubu^bs, advanced, is not fordable. To this city (which contained nearly six hundred thousand inhabitants,) the approach is over bridges, the principal of which has thirty-three arches, is flanked by four round towers, and has a covered gallery on each side. A great causeway and avenue, three thousand paces in length, seventy in breadth, and planted with a double row of lofty plane trees, approaches both ends of this bridge with a gentle declivity. This avenue, which is called the CMr-B4gh, or Four Gardens/' is. ornamented with a number of royal palaces and gardens on the right and left. On one side of that part of the avenue which lies to the south of the river, stands the beautiful suburb of Abbas- abad; on the other, that of JuM, the residence of an Armenian colony, which was protected by a high but thin wall. The army assembled at the capital was at least double the number of the AfFghans; and it seemed evident, that, should the rash invaders even succeed in obtaining possession of the suburbs, JuM, and * The zurabooruk carries a ball from one to nearly two pounds weight.622 T HE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. Abbas-abad, they could hardly hope, without cannon, to force the bridges by which they must approach the city itself. Under these circumstances, it required that all the terrors of superstitious weak ness should combine with imprudence and cowardice, before an empire could be conquered by an enemy so weak in number, so inefficient in resources, and so far removed from every prospect of aid or support. Sultan Hussein, distracted by alarm, threw himself entirely upon his nobles: these were completely divided in their opinions regarding the measures proper to be pursued. Mahomed Kooli Khan, the prime minister, wisely suggested, that they should act upon the defensive. The repulses which the Affghans had experienced at Kerman and Yezd, showed, he argued, that they were unskilled in sieges, and only formidable in the field, where their valour and experience must give them a great advantage over new levies, chiefly composed of the unwarlike populace of a luxurious capital. This sensible opinion met with some attention; but it was overruled by that of an omrah called the Waly of Arabia, from being chief of the tribes of that nation, who were subject to Persia. This nobleman inveighed with great virulence against what he termed the cowardice of the counsel given by the prime minister. (i If,' said he, a &lt;s plun- ' derer, like Mahmood, at the head of a few despicable Affghans, is ' to insult the majesty of the throne of Persia, by besieging the ' capital, and we are to remain trembling within our walls, we had ' better at once give him possession of that kingdom which we have ' not spirit to maintain. Let us do this, or march out instantly and ' vindicate our honour by the destruction of these vile enemies, who ' owe every moment of their existence to our disgraceful prudence.' The Persian character, throughout all its shades, has one predominantTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ feature: an over-weening vanity distinguishes the whole nation. The chap. xv. speech of the waly was calculated to rouse this feeling: and even the timid king, who had at first approved of the advice of his prime minister, declared his opinion that an action should be fought. But at the very moment he took this resolution, he adopted a measure which made success almost impossible. The command of the forces of the kingdom was divided between the two nobles, whose opinions regarding its defence had been so directly opposite. The royal army, when it marched out of Isfahan, consisted of Appearance more than fifty thousand men. It was attended by a train of twenty- sL'anZS four pieces of cannon. When it reached Gooln&amp;Md, nothing could ghanarmies ' be more striking than the contrast between its appearance and that of the enemy. The Persian soldiers looked fresh and showy, and all their equipments, from the tents in which they reposed, and the dresses they wore, to the gold and enamelled furniture of the sleek horses upon which they rode, were rich and splendid. The Affghans had hardly a tent to cover them, their horses were lean from fatigue, the men were clothed in tatters, and tanned by the rays of the sun ; and, throughout their whole camp, it was emphatically observed, nothing glittered ' but their swords and lances/' The right wing of the Persians was commanded by Roostum a. d. 1722. Khan, general of the royal guards, and brother to the Prince of 7 ' ' 1135 ' Georgia: the left was under the prime minister. The Waly of Arabia joined his Arabs to the right wing, and the Waly of Laristan* reinforced the left with a corps of five hundred of his followers. These two wings were entirely of horse, and their numbers were * Aly Murd&amp;a Khan.624 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. about thirty thousand men: the infantry and artillery were near twenty thousand. They were stationed in the rear, and formed a separate line, the front of which faced the open space between the two wings. Mahmood had drawn up his small army in four divisions. That on the right was under Am&amp;n-ftMh Khan. He led the next, which formed the centre, in person, and was supported by a corps of select warriors; while his left was covered by a division of new levies, prin cipally Guebers, under a chief* of that religion. The Affghans had, as has been before stated, no cannon: but one hundred zumboo- ruks, or camel swivels, more than supplied this want. These were, at the commencement of the action, kept in the rear of the right wing. Mahmood rode through his ranks, mounted on an elephant, and called upon his followers by their former fame, and by all their future hopes of wealth and glory, to strive for victory. ' The plunder ' of Isfahan/' exclaimed the prince, ' is your reward, if you con- 44 quer; and if you are defeated, you have no retreat, and you must ' then meet death, embittered by disgrace •f/' He exhorted the Guebers to remember their ancestors, and their wrongs, and to seize the opportunity he had offered them of glory and revenge.

This corps had charged the right wing of the Affghans, which was commanded by Am^n-tiMh Khan, an experienced soldier, who, when it came near him, pre tended to fly. The exulting Persians pursued, till the opening ranks of the enemy displayed a line of one hundred kneeling camels, with a swivel on the back of each. These were levelled with so deliberate an aim, that all the front rank of the charging column fell; and, before the Persians had recovered from the confusion into which they were thrown by this unexpected volley, they were attacked by the Affghan horse, and completely routed.

The latter assumes, that the Waly of Arabia acted the part of a traitor : while Krusinski positively asserts, that the calumnies which went forth against this officer, regarding his conduct in this action, vol. i. 4 l626 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. l oss the Persian army did not exceed two thousand men killed ; that of the enemy was fully as great. The Affghans, we are informed feared to pursue them, dreading some stratagem : but it is probable they were occupied in plundering the rich camp which the Persians had abandoned. Conduct pur- The terror into which Isfahan was thrown by this defeat cannot kbg after this be described. The weak king had recourse to his usual expedient of assembling his nobles, and demanding their advice. His own opinion was, that he should leave his capital, and draw together the forces of his dominion. This step would, he conceived, be even con ducive to the safety of Isfahan, as the removal of the court, and the treasures of the empire, would make that cease to be an object of importance to the Affghans; while these invaders would be harassed and distressed by the operations of the royal army collected in the field. This opinion, which appeared very reasonable, was supported by the prime minister, and several other nobles; but the Waly of Arabia argued, that the evacuation of his capital would be deemed a disgraceful flight; and that a monarch, who showed he had not fortitude to bear up against so trifling a reverse as he had experienced, would soon find himself abandoned by all, and would discover, too late, that he had, by being the first to desert his post, set the example The walls and to his subjects to forsake theirs.

His liberal policy had pro duced the end he expected ; and this colony began, even in his life time, to flourish in a manner equal to his most sanguine hopes. It attained still greater prosperity under his immediate successors: but from the very commencement of Shah Hussein's reign, a great change Their co„di- took place in their condition.

They were not only plundered of their property, but their right to the law of retaliation was denied; and more than one decree sanctioned a law, which or dained that a Mahomedan who killed a Christian should not lose his life, but only pay a certain quantity of grain to the family of the deceased *. These open attacks upon their privileges degraded this race in the estimation of the citizens of Isfahan ; and they were con sequently exposed to scoffs and insults, which were more calculated to alienate their minds from the government under which they lived, than the most serious oppression. We can hardly be surprised, there- * Hanway, Vol. II. page 161.628 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. fore, that a weak and timid court should fear to confide in a commu- nity which it had so deeply injured : and the cruelty of suspicion, at such a moment, was aggravated by the mode in which it was displayed.

Neither insult nor injury, however, could force the Armenians to that treason of which they were suspected: for though they could not but hate and despise the tyranny under which they lived, they trembled to think of the consequences which would result from the success of the AfFghans. They, therefore, offered to pay and subsist any troops that were sent to defend their town : and when they found the num bers of these inadequate, they prepared all the means they had left to supply the deficiency.

The result of his * Hanway, Vol. 11. page 161.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ measures had hitherto been more fortunate than the most san- chap. xv. guine imagination could have hoped ; yet, as if alarmed at his own success*, he withdrew into his intrenchments, and actually permitted the Persians to return, and draw off some of the cannon they had* left upon the field of battle. He did not awake from this trance of inaction till the return of his spies satisfied him of the extent of the confusion and terror that reigned in Isfahan, when the hope of benefiting by these impressions appears to have dis sipated all his apprehensions. His first step was to take posses sion of Ferr^hdbad, a royal palace, situated within three miles Takes posses- of the city, which Shah Hussein had built, and surrounded with a lac' of FeS- strong wall, defended by bastions. Had this post been maintained, babad ' it might have stopped the progress of the enemy for many days; but the garrison were commanded to retreat, and their fears rendered that so precipitate, that the cannon by which it was defended were abandoned to the enemy.

This conduct, combined with the former measure of disarming the Armenians, led many to think that it was designed to sacrifice Julfd for the safety of the capital: it being imagined that the AfFghans would, in the enjoyment of the wealth of its inhabitants, lose much of their savage ardour. Others accuse the Waly of Arabia of maintaining a secret intercourse with the enemy, while many of the Armenians themselves believed that the bigots who surrounded Hussein were not sorry to see a flourish ing colony of Christians involved in ruin. But it is ever the fate of weakness and folly to have its motives of action mistaken; and that proceeding, which was ascribed by the feelings of different classes of men to policy, treachery, or fanaticism, had, in all proba bility, its source in that consternation and irresolution which such scenes always produce in timid and undecided minds. On the night following that on which the enemy had carried the outwork, a small aperture was made on the lofty, but thin mud wall, which surrounded JuM-f*.

The victims were selected, and sent, in their richest clothes, cfiap. xv p to the Palace of FeMhaMd, where the Affghan prince resided.

The Armenians, living in the midst The horror of a sensual nation, had been accustomed to regard the honour of their the families with the most jealous care, and nothing could exceed the ans ' horror and dismay which this flagrant act of violence excited. The men appeared absorbed in silent grief: mothers shrieked with frantic wildness over their disgraced daughters: and the sad victims them selves gave loose to a despair, which rescued many of them from their fate by terminating their existencef.

No effort was made by the Persians to disturb the Affghans in these proceedings; and Mahmood, encouraged by this inactivity, called his soldiers to a more important conquest. His army occu pied the whole of the southern bank of the river from JuM to Abbas-abad. The royal edifices and beautiful gardens with which Shah Abbas the Great and his successors had decorated this quarter of their capital, at once furnished quarters for the barbarians, and * Krusinski's Memoir, page 222t t Haaway, Vol. II. page 163.652 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xv. stables for their horses; and the labours of an age fell to ruin at the touch of a savage race, who beheld these magnificent abodes of luxury with a mixed feeling of contempt and indifference.

Not a spot was uncultivated, except what was occupied with towns and villages, or with seats of noblemen, which vied in splendour with the palaces of their monarch. This fair region, so favoured by nature, by art, and by fortune, was doomed by Mahmood to complete ruin. The task occupied his army more than a month; but the lapse of nearly a century has not repaired what their barbarity effected in that period; and the fragments of broken canals, sterile fields, and mounds of ruins, still mark the zeal with which they laboured in this great work of destruction. After supplying his camp with an ample store of forage and provi sions, Mahmood directed the remainder that was found in the districts he had plundered to be burnt. This compelled the inhabitants of the country to fly to the capital, into which they were incautiously admitted by a weak government, which mistook numbers for strength : but though this had the effect of producing some scarcity, it was obvious that Isfahan could never be reduced to extreme distress as long as it was only partially invested.

The success of Amcin-lillclh Khan 'f*, who commanded a select corps of Affghan horse, which covered the siege, in intercepting these convoys, and defeating the troops by which they were accompanied, seemed to have decided the fate of Isfahan, when an event occurred, that gave a gleam of hope to the most desponding.

The king appeared resolved upon this, and he was encouraged by a proposal from the Armenians, who offered to rise upon the garrison of Julfa* the moment the Persians commenced the attack. All these fair hopes, however, were destroyed by the fears or treachery of the waly, who, seeing he could only repress this general ardour by pretending to encourage it, marched out of the city with a declared intention of fighting; but, under various pre texts, he delayed coming to action; and the hopes, which had been Captures ano- raised so high, were sunk lower than ever by the intelligence that provisions.^ 0 Mahmood had captured another large convoy of provisions.

The weak king, the same author states, attended as usual only to the representations of the artful waly; and not only censured Ahmed Aga for his rashness in attacking the enemy, but, on account of his having fired on the Arabs, removed him from his high command of governor of the town. He adds, that the eunuch only survived his disgrace two days, and it was generally believed that he swallowed poison. f This event is said to have opened the eyes of Hussein to the real character of the Waly of Arabia, and he anxiously desired to deprive that nobleman of his high office, but in the extreme to which affairs were reduced he could find no person to accept the charge.

He is not now master of the three provinces he so generously desires to bestow upon me: but if he were, the question &lt;c now at issue between us is not regarding them, but his whole kingdom/' When this negotiation was pending, intelligence was received, that Malik Mahmood, the Governor of Seistan, with a Approach of well-appointed force, was marching to the relief of the capital: and S the news of his having encamped, with ten thousand men, at Gool- lsfa ' ncibad, led the inhabitants of Isfahan to believe their miseries were at an end : but their joy completely vanished, when they learnt that the AfFghan prince had succeeded in forming a friendship with the Mahmood chief from whom they so anxiously looked for support. Some rich alliance'^™ presents, and a grant of the province of Khorassan, which, with that llim ' of Seistan, were to form a large independent kingdom, to be enjoyed by him and his successors, were the bribes which overcame the virtue and loyalty of this chief, who, having accepted the alliance of the Affghans, immediately marched to take possession of his new domi nions.

His army did not amount to twenty thousand men ; he expected no immediate re inforcement ; and though confident of success in an attack, he dreaded any further diminution of his force: he also feared, that in the confusion of a general assault, his soldiers might possess themselves of that plunder which he wished to appropriate to himself. It is asserted by one author, that Mahmood, though de sirous of reducing the number of the population of Isfahan, wished to avoid the reproach of a massacre. Swayed by these motives, he deliberately resolved on a course more terrible in its effects upon the inhabitants of that city, than the most savage violence. He protracted, under various pretexts, the negotiation for the sur render of the city for nearly two months, and, during this period, the blockade was maintained with increased vigilance. The situa tion to which the inhabitants of Isfahan were reduced by this delay was dreadful. The respectable author, on whose authority almost all the events of this memorable siege have been given, has described the scene of horror in glowing colours. The flesh of * A Mahomedan author of respectability, who was in Isfahan during the siege, informs us, that a small loaf of coarse bread sold for four gold mohurs, (eight pounds,) and that the flesh of asses was esteemed a dainty.horses, camels, and mules, was so dear*, he informs us-f-, that none but the king, some of the nobles, and the wealthiest citizens, could afford to purchase it. Though the Persians abhor dogs as unclean, they ate greedily of them, as well as that of other forbidden animals, as long as they were to be obtained. After these supplies were gone, they fed upon the leaves and bark of trees, and on leather, which they softened by boiling; and when this sad resource was exhausted, they began to devour human flesh. Men, with their eyes sunk, their countenances livid, and their bodies feeble and emaciated with hunger, were seen in crowds, endeavouring to pro tract a wretched existence by cutting pieces from the bodies of those who had just expired. In many instances the citizens slew each other; and parents murdered their children to furnish the horrid meal. Some, more virtuous, poisoned themselves and family, that they might escape the guilt of preserving life by such means. The streets, the squares, the royal gardens, were covered with carcasses; and the river Zainderood was so corrupted by dead bodies, that it was hardly possible to drink its waters. These evils were increased by the cruelty of the AfFghans, who put to death, without distinction of age or sex, all who tried to escape from this scene of calamity^. In a climate less pure and * Towards the end of August a horse's carcass sold for one thousand crowns. f Krusinski's Memoir, page 250. The description which this writer gives of the condition of the inhabitants of Isfahan is confirmed by several witnesses of this scene.
