I attach a copy of the Chairman, Aden port Trust’s letter No.1079 dated 17th April 1934, which shows that the grant of this loan to the Aden Settlement provides an outlet for the investment of the surplus funds of the Aden Port Trust in a/profitahle manner than with the Bank with which the funds are at present deposited and from which they earn a low rate of interest. The Chairman is of opinion that the transaction xlltisi will in no way impair the Port Trust finances, which are in a position to meet any liabilities that may arise in the future. 4. The Accountant General, Bombay, who was consulted, has pointed out that the method which the Aden Settlement propose to adopt for the ultimate repayment of the loan from the Port Trust should be indicated for the information of the Government of India, and has suggested a system of repayment by annual equated payments, if the Aden Port Trust had no objection to such a method. 5. in consideration of this suggestion, the Trustees have decided to give the Aden Settlement the option of repayment of the whole or a part of the loan at the end of five years, failing which the option may be exercised again at the expiry of a further period of five years, complete repayment of the loan being Government of India be moved to sanction the proposal of the Trustees of the Port of Aden to advance a loan more made within a period of 15 years from the date of its v grant to the Aden Settlement. 6. The Aden Settlement have no objection to this method of repayment, which they propose to follow by maintaining a regular Sinking Fund. 7 , in the circumstances, I recommend that the of three lakhs of rupees to the Aden Settlement on the conditionsConditions indicated above. I’h 0 Accountant General, Bombay, considers that the loan transaction is financially to the advantage of both the Port Trust and the Aden Settlement and I agree with him. I am sending copies of this correspondence to the Foreign and Political Department, as the sanction of the Government of India in that Department is neces sary in so far as the transaction affects the Aden Settlement. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- B.R.Reilly, Chief Commissioner.

In the circumstances explained above, I recommend that the Government of India be moved to sanction the pro posal of the Aden Settlement to borrow from the Aden port Trust a loan of three lakhs of rupees, and to use this sum to repay the Government loan of Rs.4 lakhs, taken by them in connection with the Water and Drainage Schemes.

Repayment to the Govermerit of India of part or whole of the loan of Rs.4 lalchs for the Water Supply and Drainage Schemes. With reference to the above loan kindly granted to the Aden Settlement for the Water Supply and Drainage Schemes (vide Government of India, Foreign and Political Department letter NO.F.33-A-31 dated 26th June 1931 embodied in the preamble of Bombay Government Resolution No.7913 dated 2nd July 1931, General Department) I have the honour to state that the Aden Settlement have only drawn Rs. 4 lakhs out of Rs. 8 lakhs sanctioned by Government and they have been able to carry out these schemes by advances from the Settlement Fund and surplus receipts for sale of water. In this connection atten tion is invited to para 11 of my note dated 14th February 1934 dealing with the Budget of the Aden Settlement for 1934-35. As the Aden Port Trust 'have agreed to lend the Aden Settlement a sum of Rs. 3 lakhs at 4|$ per annum on the terms outlined in their Resolution No.3 dated 12th April 1934(copy enclosed), the Executive Conmittee have accepted the same as per their Resolution No.35 dated 24th April 1934 (copy enclosed) in order to save the difference between the interest of 6i per cent charged by Government and 4i per cent offered by the Aden Port Trust. This will also enable the Aden Settlement to repay itself for Rs. 3 lakhs advanced by it for carrying out the Water and Drainage Schemes, so as to maintain its Reserve Fund etc. ItIt is therefore requested that the Chief Consnissloner will kindly obtain the permission of the Government of India to:- (a) the taking by the Aden Settlement of a loan of Rs. 3 lakhs from the Aden Port Trust and (b) the repayment of the loan of Rs. 4 lakhs advanced by Government to the Aden Settlement for the reasons given above. It is proposed to pay out one lakh of rupees from the Aden Settlement Fund In addition to Rs. 3 lakhs which the Aden Port Trust has agreed to lend the Aden Settlement towards the repayment of the Government loan.Letter No.1079 dated the 17th April 1S34 i’rom the Chairman, Aden Port Trust to the Civil Secretary, Aden.

The Port Trust has Rs.7,55,000/- on Fixed Deposit with the National Bank of India at very low rates of interest and to advance Es. 3 lakhs for the period required will in no way impair the liquid position of its finances should it be necessary to incur heavy expenditure at any tirae. 3. The sum standing to the credit of the Provident Fund alone was Rs.3,29,669-0-0 at 3lst March 1.34 and it would be an advantage to find a more profitable investment for tills money than to keep same on fixed deposit with the Bank at present. 4. The loan is required by the Aden Settlement in order to pay back fi part of the loan of Rs. 4 inkhn advanced by the Government of India, subject to the necessary sanction to the proposed repayment.Extract from the proceedings of a meeting of the Board of Trustees held on the 12th April 1934. 3.
