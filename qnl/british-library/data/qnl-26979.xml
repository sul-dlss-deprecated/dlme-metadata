I.E.T.p., ! Please see Foreign Office letter of 25th February below. The decision to accept the Persian suggestion was, of course, taken after consultation with you, and with your concurrence. We recognised, I think, that, while it might be arguable that the Governmental agreement now to be negotiated about telegraphs did not preclude private individuals from pressing their claims for damages against the Persian Government, it was exceedingly unlikely that the Persian Government, once the agreement had been signed, would recognise ^or a moment any such claims. But it seemed in any case exceedingly -unlikely that we could hope to get any satisfaction for such claims from Persia; there is nothing to show that any substantial number of claims (or indeed, on our information, any) have been put forward; it is, I understand from you, definitely to our advantage to accept the Persian wording in that it will preclude the Persian Government from raising a number of substantial claims against us arising out of the telegraph settlement; and in the circumstances the balance of advantage seemgi to rest with acceptance of the Persian suggestion, even if at some later stage we should be faced with a request for &lt; assistance from former members of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in respect of claims of the nature under discussion. The Foreign Office are, not unnaturally, anxious/anxious to dissociate themselves from any contingent • . • • « ( liability, and on the whole I suggest, subject to your observations, that we may accept their view and indicate our readiness formally to relieve them of liability. Have you any reason to suppose that any claims aie li.^- 1/ to be received, or that, if they are received, they are likely to be of any importance? I presume the P.O. refer only to claims by British subjects;private claims by Persian subjects being made through Persian official channels. So far as I am aware there are no outstanding private claims against the Persian Government by the British members of the staff in Persia and I do not think that any are likely to arise. The Persian line staff have from time to time lost property from civil disturbances and so far as the loss was a result of their employment compensation has been given by the Department ;inA other cases the claims have been passed on to the Persian Government and I fear have received only the same treatment as claims from other Persian subjects. In any case the claims of the line staff would be unimportant,and I agree we may safely accept the F.O. view. The word M claims” is important to us as it will cover the Persian clAim to be paid the balance due to then of the Terminal Rate and Traffic Account2871 5000 6/28 Minute Paper. Department. r\ Account,which now amounts at the present rather abnormal exchange rate to approximately 'So. 5 lakhs of rupees. Without the word M claims” it might be possible for Persia to argue that, behalf for telegraph traffic,they were entitled to receive this balance on the grounds that it did not properly constitute a 'debt'. I concur with the terms of the proposed draft letter to the F.O. that there is probably not much in this question. I doubt if it is worth referring in our letter to the Foreign Office to the distinction between claims by British subjects and by Persian subjects. The Telegraph Department in the past seems to have used its discretion in the case of the latter as between paying a measure of compensation itself and referring the claimants to their own Government. If a particularly deserving case were to be brought up in the future we could no doubt consider (particularly as the amount involved would be unlikely to be of importance) some §&amp; gratia payment.

S. 7,. 1. 25th February, 1951. ^ (E 834/10/34) % My dear Laithwaite, i**. (m**/ (Fxitnu-.ictff^ As you know, we have now, at the suggestion of the India Office,told Parr that we agree to a provision in the proposed telegraphs agreement with Persia whereby ’'The British and Persian Governments mutually agree to cancel all debts and claims existing between them in relation to telegraph matters”. It was understood orally between us that the insertion of the words ”and claims” in this phrase would preclude His Majesty’s Government from pursuing against the Persian Government claims of all kinds put forward in the past by members of the Indo European Telegraph Department. V/e are not sure of the number or nature of these claims, but suspect that most of them are on account of loss of property owing to robbery or civil disturbances, in which case the liability of the Persian Government to meet such claims is at least open to doubt. We y J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., rWe suggest, in any case, that the claims of former members of the Department should he dealt v/ith, if necessary, by the India Office and Government of India, and should be treated in connexion with the general settlement of Indo-European Telegraph questions. We feel that,if an agreement is reached with the Persian Government on the lines proposed, neither the Foreign Office nor the Treasury need concern themselves with such claims in future, and I hope that you will agree v/ith this view.n 1123 I93I ( i? 874/10/L4.)

Withdrcwal of Inco-Surcpo- Telegraph Department). Transfer to Persian Government of Gulf cables is quite out of the question. Although these cables at present touch Persian ports their importance is essentially as channel of communication between Iraq and India and they are not in any way a part of Persian teletrapn stem. The Jask-Gwadur line res not built on account of the Persian Government and so is in quite different category from those now to be hsr.aea over. nis Majesty's Government would be very reluctant to agree to transfer of ownership. They hope that you will be able to make full use of the very generous nature of the settlement as a whole and comparative un importance of Jask-Gwadur line, which after all can be ox little real use to Persia, to induce a more accommodating attitude on this point on the part of the Persian Government. I approve your language about the royalty. There is no objection to insertion of proposed reference to Arabistan lines or of words 'ana claims' in paragraph 3. AsW ' r' y &amp; 2. As regards paragraph 4 our wording was designed to cover contingency of failure on pert of authorised agent to undertake necessary responsibilities, in which esse His kalesty's Government might have to assume temporary charge. It is desirable that agreement should not preclude this possibility, and that it snoula be clear that British agent is to be designated by ,-is Majesty's Government, not by Persians, Point could however be met by adoption of following alternative phrase 'The Persian Government will permit a irrxuish agent appointed by the Government of the United Kingdom to continue to maintain and work etc.' In that case responsibility for administration and upkeep should be confined to agent. You may now inform Linister of Posts that nis Majesty’s Government are appointing Communications Company as their authorised agent and tnat in view of his enquiry we are suggesting to Company that they should get into touch with him in regard to rates etc. Director“in—Chief, undo—nurepean aelegraph Department, understands from Newton that Persians nave enquired what share they will get for traffic going via Gulf cables as they prefer this to Russian route. Answer is that they will receive their own notified terminal and transit rates in respect of Persian section, bum no share of cable rates. Wireless stations: I agree that these should be left for general Treaty as proposed. But as Persians have raised the point I see no oojection to aY' r ireless station at Hen3am and the wireless apparatus at the Bushire and Ling ah stations is to he decided in connexion with the treaty settlement now under negotiation. If you can also secure provision regard ing import of stores for maintenance, so much the hettei^ We propose to close dovn Ling ah from march 1st, post poning transfer of apparatus, which will he kept in situ in charge of subordinate, until conclusion of Treaty. From Larch 1st Bushire and Henjam will he worked by Communications Company. It might he well to mention this to the Persians and, without asking for formal assurance, to ascertain that no objection vail he taken. Repeated to India No,7.Decode. Mr. : Parr. (Tehran).

Minister for Foreign /iffairs, Minister of Posts, director of Department, and I met yesterday to' discuss outline agreement which Ministers evidently accept as basis with following modifications. 1. They consider JasloGwabur line and cables should be added to list of lines handed over in paragraph 1 in view of the fact that Persian govern ment agree in paragraph 4 to allow our control till 1945. They argue that this is their interpretation of relevant paragraph in'Sir K. Clive’s note of October 1st. I pointed out that J&amp;sk-Gwadur line and cables •came under a different category to those which were being handed over but eventually agreed to submit point to you. They also propose sentence to the effect that I.D.T. Department cease to assume responsibility for maintenance of Arabistan line. X 2. In paragraph 3 they propose addition of words 'and claims' after 'cancel all debts'. 3. In paragraph 4 they suggest omission of _L words/'fo ICC' 2 . words 'either directly or through an authorised British agent' or alternatively omission of words 'either directly or'. They also suggest addition of sentence to the effect that His Majesty’s government or their agent will he responsible for all charges in connexion with administration and upkeep. 4. They hold that Sir Tt. Clive’s note of October 1st adumbrates reference in present agreement to vdreless stations at Bushire Kenjum and Ling ah . I explained that this question really come under general treaty but promised to submit the point. In conclusion Minister of Posts expressed desire to get into touch as soon as possible with authorised British agent for tne purpose of fixing rates and making arrangements in connexion with through traffic via Bushire after March 1st. He said that this route would be used in preference to the route via Russia, lie had just received communication from Berne as regards reduction of rate for international traffic.

Apart from one,modifications appear to he more or less innocuous. In connexion with three ; Minister raised question of Jask royalty* I explained to Minister of Posts that as convention of 1868 which mentioned royalty would now presumably lapse,royalty v, r oi0.d also disappear. I also hinted to Minister for Foreign Affairs as a matter of course that question of royalty came under mutual cancellation of debts. Both ministers appeared ^ to accept explanation and did not refer to the matter further. With regard to four I should be glad to learn in what terms reference could be made to wireless station. It would seem possible to insert sentence regarding Importation of stores for maintenance so long as we are in possession. I regret that I forgot to remind Minister for Foreign Affairs about question of submission of agreement to Majlis but I will do so at once in writing. Both ministers were friendly and appeared anxious to avoid making difficulties.
