(Mr. R.D.Oldham's report). REPORT OF AN EXAMINATION OF THE COAL LOCALITIES SOUTH OF SUR IN OMAN, ARABIA. *1. Embarking on board H.M.S. Assaye I left Karachi on 28th October and reached Khor Jarama on 30th October. On 31st October I was joined by Captain P.Z. Cox, His Majesty's Consul at Muscat, and on 1st November we landed. After devoting a djay to the measure ment of a base line and starting the topographical survey we left Khor Jarama on 3rd November . Two long marches brought us to Musweh, the first of the localities at which coat was known to exist. The five days from 5th to 9th November were devoted to investigation of this locality. On the 10th November I visited the second of the reported localities, Jebel Khami, and on 11th November we marched to - Migel, in the Fisao valley, the locality which was visited by Dr. Von Krafft and Captain Cox in May last. Three days proved sufficient for the investigation of this locality, and on 15th November we left it, arriving at Suk Sur on 16th November. Here I was detained till 21st November, when I embarked on H.M.S. Perseus and reached Muscat the following day. 3. and from Faliz on to Suk Sur fresh water is found , but elsewhere At Faliz^where there are only a few scattered water holes of small size and yielding a limited supply of brackish water. 4. The coal is found among rocks of tertiary age, classed by Dr. Von Krafft as miocene, which occur in the centre of a synclinal, and are, consequently, the newest rocks of the district. The out crop ends, by the closing in of the cynclinal, about 4 miles north of Migel on the one hand and 3 miles south of Musweh on the other, giving a total length of hbout 10 miles, along which the dip of the rocks is towards the centre from either side. 5. The first locality visited was about half a mile south of the camp at Musweh water. 10. The second locality visited was Jebel Khami, on the eastern slope of the Musawi range. The coal occurs in rocks which belong to the same series as those in which the Musweh coal is found, but lower2 I % £&gt;&gt; i down in it. There were a couple of thin hands of coal, associatec with thick beds of carbonaceous shale and evidently as inconstant as the Musweh coals. 11* Having examined the Jebel Kharai, andtMuswehtlocalities we were on to Nigel, which is in the same field as Musweh, though in a different drainage basin and separated by a ridge of about 500 feet in height. Here I saw the outcrop examined by Dr. Von Krafft, a good exposure of nice looking coal, which would have been regarded as very promising but for the experience gained at Musweh. The anticipation that it too would thin out very rapidly was strengthened by the variation of thickness along the exposure^ One measurement gave 4 feet 9 inches, another 16 feet off gave 5 feet 1 inch, and a third, obtained 12 feet further on by digging out the extreme end of the exposure gave 3 feet 2^ inches. This pointed to a rapid thinning out, but I soon found that the coal extended further than at first sight seemed probable . Up the valley I found two exposures on the same side, and about 300 yds up, under a cliff, over which the water falls on the rare occasions when the stream flows , there was a deep cut recess at the back of which an exposure of carbonaceous shale was seen. On clearing this out and digging downward the coal seem was found, with a thickness of 4 feet and 6 inches.”— Political Agency &amp; H.B.M's Consulate, Muscat, the 14th March, 1941.

Sultan was however discouraging to their representative in April. 3. They also feel doubt about physical security in these remoter areas and apart from n all clear H from Sultan would require fairly definite opinion from Resident that parties would be safe. If these assurances were forth coming they would make great efforts to send in party based on Dhofar (though it would hardly be possible fmaaxtkm to do so this / winter) and in that case it might be possible frtm for them to attach Mineral Expert to party to make special report on mineral resources for Sultan. 4. It was intended that their representative should discuss prospects of exploration with Sultan at Salalah about Chrifctmas and question of special mineral survey regarding which they have ofcourse received no direct request from Sultan might be discussed at same time.

With reference to above subject and my lecent investigations in Dhufar on behalf of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and ‘Oman, I enclose a letter which I would be grateful for transmission to him. A copy of the correspondence is attached for your reference and record (particularly paragraphs 3 and 5 of my letter to the Sultan)• His Highness is staying at the Palance at SALALAH. Dhufar, and he adked me to have my letters and Report sent through you to the Resident at Aden. I understood that by so ^oing the Resident at Aden would send on such correspondence through the kind offices of the Royal Air Force if you were kind enough to make the request. As yyu will see from my letter to the Sultan, my Report will take another 10 days or so to complete as I must await the results of the chemical analyses. May I thank you for all the arrangements made for my journey to Salalah. I would like to say also that in the person of the Sultan of Muscat and ‘Oman the Government of India have - a sincere friend, and that the Ruler is most anxious to open up his country. The climate of J9hufar is good, there is more water than I think they have realised as available, both at the surface and underground. There is an anchorage in Risut Bay and a landing gfound at Salalah (a nd a n emergency iM*±xjpqnnnEciiOT*±xx±xtaix±xfcxixMixMxmigxiqcxx landing ground near Murbat). The Sultan needs, in my opinion, agricultural advice - on sugar-cane, etc., and surveys of Dhufar (as the maps are on too small a scale for geological mapping or engineering purposes. I have the honour to be, Sir, Ynu-r nhpdient servant. - Sd/- Cyril S.Fox.SSULm /ft, RFPERENCE No. Dhufur-46#47. 5, London Court, Moirs Street, Calcutta. 1st March, 1947, (00) From To Sir Cyril S.Fox, -fi His Hlfhness, The Sultan of Muscat and 'Oman, at Salalah, Dhufar Province, Sultanate of 'Oman, Sourt-Fast Arabia. S T TBJFCTi- ^ Mineral Audit of the Industrial Resources of Shufar Province.. Slry I have the honour to say that I arrived back in India on the 17th February 1947, after my visit and tours in Dhufar and brought with me all the specimens I collected and which I thought should be examined more thoroughly than was possible at Salalah. The specimens for chemical analysis have been handed to Messrs. R.V. Bripgs &amp; Co.. £44, Garstin Place, Calcutta. The fossils and some of the mineral and rock specimens have been sent to the Director,Geological Survey of India, 27 Chowringhee, Calcutta, for identification or determination. In the meanwhile I have searched the literature dealing with south-eastern Arabia, and Muscat and 'Oman, and narticularly with regard to Dhufar. The chief papers are of course those of Hj[J/JCarter of 1846 oY a'century ago, and G.M.Lees of 1928, for accurate geological information. I have read very carefully 'Southern Arabia' by Mr. 4 Mrs Theodore Bent as well as 'Arabia Felix' by Mr. Bertram Thomas, for data they collected, but I have made a thorough ^cru^iny of all available literature on travel on S.F. Arabia. Carter, the Bents and others have recorded their difficulties due to tribal disturbances, and Mr. Lees has said that without the hospitality of the shieks it would be impossible to carry out explorations, ^his relates to barely 16 years ago. It is therefore my duty to record that those sheiks and others who were ray guides and helpers across the Qar* Mountain*' were most attentive and kind and most anxious that their assistance, if useful, should be made known to yourself. This shows tha^t 'the Sultan's writ' does now cover a much a much larger area than previously. ■ V V \ Although I have be^un the draft of the Report 1 will have to wait, perhaps a week longer, for the assays, etc., before I can complete and forward it as I said I would do in Duplicate. Meanwhile I will sending a rough Cover Page and Title Page (typed copy)of the brouchure as it might be published. Please return the Copy if it necessary to m^ke emendations. The actual publication cannot be taken in hand until yon have read and approved of the Report. It is imposs^ible to thank you for all your kindness and consideration, but I will cherish the memory of a Ruler who is anxious to lift his people and country. Yours sincerelhi, Sd/- Cyril S.Fox.

Sir, With reference to above subject and my recent investigations in Dhufar on behalf of His Highness the sultan of Muscat and »Oman, I enclose a letter which I would be grateful for transmission to him. A copy of the correspondence is attached for your c reference and record (particularly# paragraphs 2 and 5 of my letter to the Sultan). His Highness is stating at the palace at SALiiLAH, •L'hufar, and he asked me to have my letters and Report sent through you to the Resident at Aden. I understood that by so doing the Resident at Aden would sent on such correspondence through the kind ♦ office of the Royal Air Force if you were kind enou^i to make the request. As you will see from letter to the Sultan, my Report will take another 10 days or so to complete as I must await the results of the chemical analyses. May /i - 2 - 1 May I thank you for all the arrangements made jmy journey x,o baiaiah. I would like to say also that in the person of the Sultan of Muscat and f Oman the Goveriment of India have a sincere friend, and that th« Ruler is most anxious to open up his country. The climate of Shniar is good, there is more water than I think they have realised as available, both at the surface and underground. There is an anchorage in Risut Bay and a landing ground at Saiaiah (and an emergency landing ground near Murbat)* The Sultan needs. In my opinion, agricultural advice - on sugar-cane, etc., and surveys of Dhufar (as the maps are on too small a scale for geological mapping or engineering purposes. I have the honour, to be.

SCBJHCI:- A Mineral Audit of the Industrial Resources of *hufur province. I have the honour to say that I arrived back in India on the 17th February 1947, after my visit ■ and tours in Ohufar and brought with me all the specimens I collected and which I thought should be examined more thoroughly than was possible at Salaiah. The specimens for chemical analysis have been handed to Messrs. R.V.Briggs &amp; Co., 0 d 4, Garstln Place, Calcutta. The fossils and some of the mineral and rock specinens have been sent to the Director, Geological Survey of India, R7 Chowringhee, Calcutta, for identification or determination. In the meanwhile I have searched tne litera ture dealing with south-eastern Arabia, and Muscat and (Oman, and particularly with regard to Dhufar. The cnief papers are of course those of h.J. carter of 1846 of a century ago, and G.M. Lees of 1»^3, for accurate geological information. I have read very carefully ’'Southern Arabia' by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Theodore Bent as well as »*raiba Felix' by Mr. Bertram Thorran, Sir for / —I 2 for data they collected, but I have made a thorough scrutiny of an available literature on travel on S.E. Arabia, Garter, the Bents and others have recorded their difficulties due to tribal disturbances and Mr. Lees bas said that without the hospitality of the shieks it would be impossible to carry out explorations. This relates to barely 15 years ago. It is therefore my duty to record that those sheiks and others who were my guides and helpers across the Qara Mountains were most attentive and kind and most anxious that their assistance, if useful, should be ir&amp;de known to yourself. This shows that n the Sultan f s writ' does now cover a much larger area than previously. Although I have begun the draft of the Report I will have to wait,perhaps a week longer, for the assays, etc., before I can complete and forward it as I said I would do in Duplicate. Meanwhile I am sending a rough Cover Page ana Title Page (typed copy) of the brochure as it might be published. Please return the Copy if it necessary to make emendations. The actual publication cannot oe taken in hand until you have ready and approved of the Report. kindness and consideration, but I will cherish trie memory of a Ruler who is anxious to lift his people and country.

SUBJECT : A Mineral Audit of the Industrial Resources of Dhofar Province. In continuation of my letter of the 1st I arch, 1947, I have now begun to write my Report on the above subject and attach herewith a table of CONTENTS of the projected chapters or sections with which I propose to deal in the REPORT. I have drawn attention to the need for Maps, on a scale suitable for geological mapping and for agricultural and engineering purposes, because it is not possible to make such surveys without proper maps, say on the scale of one mile to one inch. The Map I have drawn to accompany my Report (a rough copy) is being prepared for immediate despatch to you) is a mere sketch as I was never quite certain of my true position while on tour in and on the far side of the Qara mountains. I have not yet received the results of the analysis being made by Messrs. R. V. Briggs, notr the determi nation of fossils and minerals from the Geological Survey of India, but these data are expected at any time now and awaited with interest. If there is any point which I may appear to have overlooked in the CONTENTS please let me know as early as possible, but it can easily be included later, after the the Report has been submitted but before it is decided to print the Report for publicity.

Subject : Correspondence with the Sultan of i uscat and Oman through New Delhi and Aden for Salalah, Dhufar. I have the honour to send herewith a cover addressed to His Highness, the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, at Salalah, Dhufar, for kind transmission through the Government of Aden and the Royal Air Force by air mail and air despatch. This correspondence is really in conclusion to that of the 19th March when I sent my Report, in duplicate, for transmission to the Sultan. Now I give particulars of the cost of a topographical and a geological (detailed) survey of Dhufar. In my opinion the Sultan would be best advised to publish rffy Report (and I am ready to have this done for the printing charges alone) and have it reviewed by commercial and financial newspapers in the U. K. and 1 •d.A. Some big company might then have all the surveys made at their cost. This will not save the Sultan the expense of improving communications and maintaining housing and air-pert facilities, which I consider very important. Yours faithfully, CyrilS.

I expect you have received it now. 4 I enclose for your consideration two letters (i) one from Ghosh &amp; Co., Surveyors, and the other (ii) from the Mineral Prospecting Syndicate Limited. They will give you an approximate idea of the cost that .would be incurred for (a) topographical maps and (b geological mapping of an area of 4,500 square miles of country like Dhufar. Attached is a copy of my letter to the B-ptist Mission Press making tentative enquiries as to publication of my Report should you desire this to be done. 1 have taken all the necessary steps to save time should there be any delay in receiving your permission to publich the brochure on behalf of the Sultanate of Muscat &amp; Oman.

SUBJECT : A Report on the mineral resources of Dhofar, Oman. Dear Sir, 1 have to acknowledge the kind letter No. F 7(209)-BPG/46 dated the 22nd April 1947, which was delivered here on the 29th April on y return from New Delhi i.e. after I had seen you at your office in New Delhi on the 28th April. \I telegraphed you from Shillong on the 30th April that I was obliged to postpone my departure from India on the 4th May for two weeks. This gives us a little more time to hear if the Report has been delivered to the Salt n at Salalah. Today I have had a further shock. This is that the Baptist fission Press knowing 1 was due to go tomcrrow and not having specific orders to do so have put up the typescript of the Report and sent me the 'galley proofto correct. Perhaps this will prove to be a stroke of good fortune 'or the Sultan.if he desires the printing as it is pratically ready now. If he does not want it, I will be faced with a bill of fis 1750 or more plus Rs 600 for analyses done by R.V. Briggs. It is my considered opinion that, notwithstanding the understanding with Petroleum ooncessi ns Limited, the Report be printed and copies sent to newspapers in the U.3.A. and U.K. for review (and pu licity). If the ^ultan himself went to the U.r. and U.d.n. about July and August the press would let everyone know, and he could be contacted by int rested firms. However, I am rr w going ahead with the printing as it has sot to-say been decided for us by the printers. * 1 would like your advice about the despatch of the print- fed copies. Out of 250 copies I will keep about 30 for newspaper reviews and send you 3 copies and Colonel R. . H y 2 copies an 15 copies by post to the Sultan through you or Col. Hay. The remaining 201 copie, (fo sale) should go by parcel to the Sultan so that his Secretary can despatch individual copies when applied for by firms who are interested, I could dispose of some myself in England if so desired. The Indian National Airways must have been paid for my passage to Salalah and back as they have not put in any bill since I wrote to them on the 19th March 1947. The only bi^ls against the ^ultan at present are Rs 600 for chemical analyses made by R.V. Briggs and submitted with my Report- on the 19th March 1947 and then the printing charges Rs 1750 to Rs 1800 by the Baptist Mission Press for the printing of 250 copies of the Report. I will pay these and the Sultan c.n send me a cheque for £ 180 at his convenience. May. I thank you again for your kind attention in this matter and your kindness to me when I called on you on the 28th April. I am, Yours sincerely, 3d/ Cyril 3. Fox.ULr L iiEKCE Dhufar/Oman-47.

SUBJECT: A report on the Mineral Resources of Dhufar Province, DeSr ^ ltan ’ XF 1145 R1190/18 I receiv d your t legram /./ dated xrom Muscat 13th April, 1947, in which you say you have not yet hac my ieuort. I sent the Report on the 19th March, lo47, to the Department of Foreign (External) Affairs, Government of India, New Delhi, to forward to you in the manner you hac nesireo. The Hon’ble Colonel R. L. Hay, Political xv b ent, Persian ^ull, Bahrein, has also written to me to say he haa enjoyec a visit to Salalah and that my Report had not arrived when he left, x — has been a great shock to me as I have been awaiting oraeis to orint the Report (and indeed placed the complete manuscript with maps and drawings and photograph in the hands ol the baptist Lission Press to save time). As I was due to fly to England on the 4th May (tomorrow took the plane to New Delhi and saw Major Creighton, the foreign Secretary, on the 28th April. His office had also sent me^ particulars (their letter No. F.7(209)-BPG/46, dated the *2nd April) of the posting of the Report to you from New Uelhi on the 27th March, 1947. The Foreign Secretary ana Captain Low have assured me that the Report was sent forward without any delay, and they are very kindly making enquiries about it. I have meanwhile been obliged to postpone my journey to England for two or three weeks as my wife has not quite recoyerec from her operation and is unable to travel at present. This gives me a little more time to hear from you. Meanwhile, without my definite instructions, the Baptist Mission Press, 41-A Lower Circular Road, Calcutta, have prepared tie'”j alley oroof' of the Report, and so I am rather embarrassed in case you bo not v;ant the Report printed. I had strongly recommended the printing so that conies night be rent to t U c a anc i u k. newspapers for review (and publicity). it seems only right nov.- to get the Report printed and I am correcting the 'Proof' very carefully, and I hope you will be satisfied with it. The cost is higher thaA I thought (fs 1750 for 850 copies plus ■ . 600 for chemical analyses to Messrs. R. ^• 3riggs or say n ou Is 2,400/- for you to pay) but it is well v '° rt} lPO t i~ter V ' lj the bills and you can seno me a cheque for x. 180 later. You will find the Report complete when printed as I did not include all details in the manuscript copies I sent you with my letter of the 19th March. feel you should be in England and tour the b.o.A. about July and August so as to be accessible to Oil companies and others who might make you offers for mineral rights.

The whole case was to have been forwarded to the Sultan*s agent at Muscat.

From To Sir Cyril S. Fox, The Under Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of External Affairs &amp; Commonwealth Relations New Delhi, India. SUBJECT: Printed Report on the Mineral Resources &gt; of Dhufar, Oman. Sir I am in receipt of your Air Mail letter No.D.258- AWT/47 dated the 21st September 1947 which has just come to hand and I am exceedingly troubled to know that my parcel for the Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman with the three packages, A. B, and C, which was sent as a Registered Parcel on the 13th June 1947 had not yet been received by your office although the wooden box with 220 copies of the Report had just arrived when you wrote. It happens that I have the Receipt for the parcel that is under consideration containing four separate packages as follows: A. with 230 'Correction Slips' for the Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman; B. 36 printed letters for newspaper reviews ; C. 8 copies of Report with Correction Slips ; the fourth package contained copies of letter , Sultan Said bin Taimur, for information. The Sultan has been most kind and in spite of all that I have tried to do for this fine Ruler things seem to be unduly delayed once their control is out of my hands. I am aware that there has been some disorder in India, but I did not leave until the 8th of July, nearly a month after I had posted and registered the last of the parcels for Sultan Saiyid bin Taimur, and as I have the Receipt for Registration perhaps the parcel can be traced. The Receipt is from the Park Street post office, Calcutta, dated 13th June 1947 and under Registration No.249 for which I paid Rs.8-6-0. I think the above information should serve you to trace the parcel (I believe I actually sent it as a letter in the hope that it save time!). I will retain the actual receipt meanwhile as there is every likeli hood that I will be flying to Calcutta in two weeks time and will see to this matter there myself. letters do you should receive it within a week and I would be very much obliged if a cable could be sent to me saying whether the 'MISSING HAS BEEN RECEIVED' or not as the case may be. In the meantime I will have an additional 240 copies of the 'Correction Slip' printed to replace those that are missing. I trust you will be kind enough to cable me before the 17th October in any case. My cable address would be Cyril Fox 19 Queensmere Road London SW19 or if you prefer cable through my bankers Lloyds Bank 6 Pall Mall London asking them to inform me immediately. I am not in close communication with your Commonwealth Relations Office in King Charles Street (Whitehall) but my telephone number is WIMbledon 7457 so that anyone can call me up. I am very upset about all this as the Sultan has paid and not yet been served. If this letter travels as fast as normal Air Mail I am, Yours very sincerely, (SGD.) CYRIL S. FOX8th October, 1947.

I am much disturbed that the condition of the post in India have been the cause of this unbelievable delay and the probable loss of the ^Correction slips*' which I went to much trouble to have prepared. Col. Sir Rupert Hay has just returned to Bahrain as the Hon*tle the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, and I am sending him a copy of all this correspondence, unofficially, so that he will know the position and possibly be able to help. I was unable to contact him before he left London as we have not settled in this house yet and I am busy with various matters, both domestic and for India. In any case the letter from India (enclosed copy) came after the Hon'ble Col. Sir Rupert Hay had left or I would have seen him. I was to have left for India on the 1st October, but the regulations make it compulsory to be inoculated against cholera and so I have been delayed, perhaps fortunately, and expect to fly from here about the 21st October, but my route has not yet been indicated. As you know I had found that the amount due to me was somewhat less than £180 so that I have £25 or so to your credit and I propose to get 240 copies of the 'correction slip' printed in India by the Baptist Mission Press if the Government of India cable me to say that the parcel which has been lost in the post has NOT been delivered. I will not take action meanwhile on this detail. \ I do not expect to be in India very long, probably not till Christmas, but my address there is my flat in Calcutta, 5 Loudon Court, Moira Street, in case you wish to write to me there. My wife, Lady Fox, will be in close touch with me from here through Lloyds Bank, 6 Pall Mall, London and Lloyds Bank, 37 Chowringhee, Calcutta, so that you may choose your channel as you may th^nk fit. * As soon as I know my route I will inform Sir Rupert both as regards my outward journey and my return. He has very kindly offered me hospitality on my way back and I would gladly accept this if I can be of real assistance to you. The Iraq Petroleum Company have asked for a copy of the Report but I have no authority to give it so I have not done so, as you are probably in touch with them. I am, Yours very sincerely, % (SGD.)
