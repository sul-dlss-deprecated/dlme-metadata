It further reports that these slaves were transported to Bahrein aboard the
                           Bombay, a vessel flying British colours.It explains that though there is no evidence that the owners of the Bombay were aware of this, it is potentially damaging to Britain's political reputation among the Arab Chiefs and Persia; it makes British policy towards the slave trade look inconsistent. It notes a suggestion from the Resident that all British ship owners should in future be required to obtain a declaration from all passengers declaring that they are not trafficking slaves.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000017#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
