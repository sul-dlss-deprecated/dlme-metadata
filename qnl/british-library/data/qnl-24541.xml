[Communicated by the India Office.] IN April 1866 the then Wahabee Amir, Imam Abdullah-bin-Fysul, entered into a voluntary engagement with the British Government (in the form of a declaration, which was not signed on our side), by which he bound himself— 1. Not to oppose or injure British subjects residing in territories under his authority. 2. Not to “ injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, specially on the Kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zukat that has been customary of old.” With the decline of the Wahabee power and the withdrawal of their influence from politics on the coast, the above engagement ceased to be of practical value, and all relations between the Wahabees and ourselves came to an end. It is worth recording that in October 1901, at a time of serious intertribal disturbances in the interior of Arabia, we came to an understanding with the Turkish Government that we would do what we could to discourage the Sheikh of Koweit from aggressive action, on the under standing that the Turks would endeavour to restrain the Amir of Nejd. The successes of the present Wahabee Amir, Abdul Aziz-bin-Saoud, over his rival the Amir of Nejd (Abdul Aziz-bin-Rashid) again brought the Wahabee question to the front. In February 1904, when the Government of India were February 8^, 1904. considering a proposal to send an Agent to Riadh, the Wahabee capital, for the purpose of collecting information on Central Arabian affairs, Mr. Brodrick telegraphed to the Viceroy as follows :— “No steps should be taken to enter into closer relations with Nejd, or send Agents there, 1098 (2) B..,5 without previous sanction of His Majesty’s Government.” Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted, while recognizing the advantages of obtaining fuller information as to affairs in the interior of Arabia, held that the moment was not opportune for the action suggested ; and to this opinion the Govern ment of India, after receiving the views of Colonel Kemball, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, subscribed in a despatch dated the 24th March, 1904. They considered, however, that, in view of recent developments of the situation, there was reason to think that it may shortly he incumbent on us to take a more lively interest in the affairs of Central Arabia,” and they added that: “ later, .... when the political situation in Hejd has developed, and above all if the present representative of the Wahabee family .... succeeds in establishing and ex tending his ascendancy, which from the latest accounts received seems to be not improbable, we think that it may be desirable again to enter into relations with our old ally.” The successes of Bin Saoud in April 1904 led the Turkish Government to send troops and guns to the assistance of Bin Bashid. Bin Saoud thereupon wrote to the Besident in the Persian Gulf on the 2nd May, 1904, protesting against the Turkish invasion and soliciting the protection of Great Britain for himself and his country. At the same time the Besident received from Sheikh Mubarak of Ivoweit a letter addressed to the latter by Bin Saoud, in which he hinted that, if he failed to obtain British protection, he might have to fall back on the Russian offer of assistance made to him in 1903. The Govern ment of India, in reporting this on the 20th May, suggested that it might become necessary to revive the proposal to post a British Besident at Koweit, in order to watch events, should the Turks persist in armed intervention. Sir N. O’Conor had already been instructed, on the 10th May, 1904, to point out to the Porte that His Majesty’s Government, in the hope of assisting to preserve the peace, had “employed special efforts to dissuade the Sheikh of Koweit from taking part, even indirectly, in the hostilities that have broken out,’ and to protest against any action being taken by the Turkish Govern ment “which might add still further to the Sir N. O’Conor to Lord Lansdowne, February 26,1904. ( !a (f. Government of India’s letter, March 24, 1904. n Sir N. O’Conor to Foreign Office, April 26, and May 4, 1904. Viceroy’s telegram. May 20, 1904.

O’Conor was further ins tructed by telegraph to communicate at once with the Porte, and to repeat in urgent terms the representations he had already been instructed to make. Sir N. O’Conor replied on the 23rd May that it was difficult to see on what grounds the Porte could be pressed to refrain from assisting the Amir of Nejd, who was the party attacked. He considered that we should confine ourselves for the present to maintaining intact the territory of Koweit and awaiting developments, but that, if the Turks persisted in rendering assistance to Bin Bashid, it might be expedient to reconsider the question of appointing a British Besident at Koweit. The substance of Sir N. O’Conor’s views was telegraphed to India on the 24th May. In reply the Government of India, in a telegram dated the 29th May, suggested that Sir N. O’Conor should be instructed to inform the Porte that we had no desire to assist Bin Saoud directly or indirectly, but that if, as a result of Turkish support, Bin Bashid became unduly powerful, our interests in Eastern Arabia might be injuriously affected. They held that British prestige at Koweit would be impaired if, by preventing Mubarak from assisting his friend and ally Bin Saoud, and by stopping the importation of arms, we allowed Turkish influ ence to determine the supremacy of the Turkish nominee in Central Arabia. Their conclusions were that an Agent should be sent to Koweit, and that the arms trade there should not be interfered with. The proposal to send an officer as Political Agent to Koweit was approved by His Majesty’s Government, and the Government of India were informed accordingly on the 24th June, 1904. It was decided at the same time to defer for the present any fresh measures for the prevention of the importation of arms at Koweit. Captain Knox, the officer appointed, proceeded to Koweit in August K04 Towards the end of August 1904 the Turks, who had hitherto supported Bin Bashid, made overtures to Bin Saoud, and the latter applied to Sheikh Mubarak for advice as to how the Turkish advances should be met. Mubarak approachedthe Political Agent at Koweit on the subject in October 1904, but Captain Knox informed him that be bad no instructions to give advice, and that Pin Saoud should consult bis own interests in the matter. On the 30th December, 1901, Mr. Brodrick telegraphed to the Govern ment of India that &lt;£ His Majesty’s Government desire that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence are to be confined strictly to coast-line of Eastern Arabia, and that nothing should he said or done to connect them even indirectly with warfare now in progress in interior. They agree that Knox should give no opinion on advice to be given by Mubarak to Bin Saoud, but should repeat to former warnings already given against entanglements in interior.” It may be added that in Eebruary 1905 a meeting took place at Koweit between Sheikh Mubarak, the Turkish Yali of Bussorah, and Bin Saoud’s father, and Bin Saoud seems subsequently to have come to terms, for the time being, with the Turkish Government. Towards the end of 1905 Bin Saoud, whose successes in Nejd had continued unabated, paid a visit to El Katr and addressed letters to the Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast, announcing his intention of visiting their territories in the following spring. The most important of the Trucial Chiefs, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, con ferred personally with the Sultan of Muscat on the situation, both mlers regarding the prospect of Bin Saoud’s visit with considerable apprehension. The Government of India addressed the Secretary of State on the subject in a despatch dated the 11th January, 190o, in which they pointed out “ how very serious to our prestige and influence the consequences might be if Bin Saoud should attack the Pirate Coast Chiefs or the Sultan of Muscat, or succeed in extending his influence over them, and how important it is that we should prevent, as far as lies in our power, such a contingency, especially now that the Wahabee Amir has recognized the suzerainty of the Sultan.” They accordingly proposed that inquiry should be made, either through Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit or through the Sultan of Muscat, as to Bin Saoud’s intentions, with a view to ascertaining “ whether he is prepared to stand by the engagement of his predecessors not to oppose or injure British subjects residing in his Captain Knox to Captain Trevor, October 17, 1904.

O’Conor had been consulted on the proposal to approach Bin Saoud otherwise than through the medium of the Turks. O Major Cox to Government of India, February 4, 1906. &amp;i/o£ Sir N. O’Conor, March 20, 1906. Meanwhile, on the 19th January, 1906, Captain Knox, the Political Agent at Koweit, had talked the matter over informally with Mubarak, and after inquiring as to the truth of the reports regarding Bin Saoud’s inten tions, gave the Sheikh a hint that any inter ference by the Wahabee Amir in the affairs of States in Treaty relation with us would not be likely to find favour with the British Govern ment. Mubarak replied that he regarded Bin Saoud’s plans as designed merely to extort money from the Sheikhs on the coast, and that he had himself written to Bin Saoud strongly advising him against persisting in any such attempt. Major Cox, in reporting this conversation to the Government of India, suggested that he should be authorized to inform all the Trucial Chiefs that the Government of India “ would not regard with complacency the intrigues of any of them with Bin Saoud.” The Government of India telegraphed on the loth March, 1906, supporting Major Cox’s sug gestion, which was approved, with the concur rence of the Foreign Office, by Mr. Morley’s telegram dated the 9th April. As regards the warning to Bin Saoud con templated by the Government of India, the Foreign Office adopted the views of Sir N. 1098 (2) CO’Conor, who had been consulted and had recommended in a despatch dated the 20th March, 1906, that any such warning should he conveyed direct to Bin Saoud, and not through the agency of the Sheikh of Koweit or the Sultan of Muscat. Sir N. O’Conor further suggested that Bin Saoud, in the event of his visiting the coast, should be met by a British vessel of war at one of the places which he proposed to visit, and told that no tampering with the engagements and Conventions of the Trucial Chiefs would he permitted. In conveying the decision of His Majesty’s Mr. Morle/s Government to the Government of India, the JpnU^’igoe Secretary of State wrote as follows in a despatch dated the 13th April, 1906 :— “ His Majesty’s Government accept the view that a warning to the Amir would he necessary if he were to carry out his reported intention. They consider, however, that it would be better that such warning should he conveyed to him only in the event of his appearing upon the coast, and that it should then he conveyed to him directly as proposed by Sir N. O’Conor.” Bin Saoud’s reply to Mubarak’s letter of advice was communicated to the Political Agent, Koweit, on the 25th February, 1906. Major Major Cox to Cox described it as a very courteous response.” India 1 Ument C The terms of Bin Saoud’s letter, as translated April 5, 1906. from the vernacular, are obscure, hut his In April 1906 news was received of the defeat and death of Bin liashid at the hands of his rival, Bin Saoud, On the 16th September, 1906, Major Cox Major Cox attention to £he. overtures that had been made by and on behalf of Bin Saoud with a view to the establishment of a closer connection between himself and the British Government, and recom mended that the opportunity should be taken to come to terms with the Wahabee Chief on the following grounds:— 1. That overtures had been made at various imes by Bin Saoud himself, and by Sheikhjjf apparent object was to disclaim any intention of objectionable action. As a matter of fact, Bin Saoud did not yet visit the Pirate Coast. again raised the question of entering into closer j^°Y® rilinent relations with the interior of Arabia. He drew September 16, again raised the question of entering into closerJasim-bin-Thani of Katr and Sbeikh Mubarak of Koweit on Bin Saoud’s behalf, with a view to securing for the latter some measure of British protection, and that if we neglected these over tures Bin Saoud and his following might regard us with hostility. 2. That if a friendly understanding were to exist between the British Government and Bin Saoud, both the Sultan of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs would be fortified by the know ledge that any attempt on the part of the Wahabee to make a descent upon Oman would involve a preliminary rupture between him and the British Government. 3. That if Bin Saoud were our friend he would be able to assist us in suppressing piracies in the northern part of the Gulf. 4. That such a friendly understanding would facilitate Major Cox’s dealings with the Trucial Chiefs and would render it possible for our officers to make occasional tours in the Nejd country. 5. That the Arabs of Central Arabia, apparently driven to desperation by Turkish interference, seemed disposed to make common cause to throw off the yoke, and were apparently trying to secure the support of the Sheikh of Koweit and even of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. liealizing, how ever, that they were not strong enough to stand alone, they saw the necessity of enlisting the support of a Christian Power, and if we did not respond they might approach some other Power. It may be explained that, in addition to the overtures of Sheikh Mubarak and Sheikh Jasim the subject had also been broached by an emis sary of Bin Saoud himself, one Musaad-bin- Suweilim, who arrived at Bahrein in January 1906 and informed the British Agent there that Bin Saoud now felt himself strong enough to turn the Turks out of Hassa and Katif, and then wished to enter into Treaty relations with the British Government, allowing us, if we desired, to keep a Political Officer in Hassa or Katif in return for our protecting him from a sea attack by the Turks. Major Cox’s letter of the 16th September, 1906, was sent home for information in the ordinary course, without comment, in October 1906. On the 9th November Mr. Morley informed the Government of India by telegram that “ His Majesty’s Government maintain view 1098 (2) Dthat their interest and influence should he confined to coast.” No steps,” the telegram added, “ should he taken to enter into relations with Nejd or to send Agents into interior without my previous sanction.” Bin Saoud lost little time in renewing his application. In October 1906 he sent a further message through Sheikh Jasim, in which his proposals were set forth in greater detail. This message, which was delivered by Sheikh Jasim to the interpreter of the British Political Agent, Bahrein, was thus reported by Captain Prideaux Captain Prideaux on the 17th November, 1906 :—• SoSiber^i?,’ 1906. “The resources of Nejd are stated to have been strained to the utmost by the recent inter necine wars, and Bin Saoud considers that the oases of Hassa and Katif were always the most profitable possessions of his Wahabee ancestors. He is anxious, therefore, to recover the two districts, and he proposes that a secret under- standing should be arranged between the British Government and himself, under which he should be granted British protection from Turkish assaults at sea, in the event of his ever succeed ing in driving the Turks, unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protec tion the Amir is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to those of the Trucial Chiefs), and to accept a Political Officer to reside at his Court. The details of this secret Treaty he wishes to be settled or discussed at an interview which he is ready to give me, either in person or with his brother representing him, at some convenient rendezvous in the desert. Bin Saoud is determined to make an effort to obtain possession of Hassa and Kati f, for without the additional revenue which he can derive from these tracts he admits that he is unable to control the tribes who menace the highways of commerce and pilgrimage. He proposes, therefore, in the first place, to apply to the Sultan for the Mutascirrif-Jik (Governorship) of the districts, and to throw off the Turkish yoke as soon as he considers the moment favour able after establishing himself. If his application is refused, he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready, and, having captured them, he will appeal openly to tne British Government for protection. If he fails, he will never betray the secret understanding between himself and the U /Goyernment. Possibly he will not make his attempt even for four or five years more.” Major Cox to Government of India, November 24, 1906. In forwarding Captain Prideaux’s Report to the Goyernment of India, Major Cox, in a letter dated the 24th November, 1906,, urged the necessity of an “ authoritative ” reply being returned to the “ references made through the local officers by Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit and Sheikh Jasim of Katr on behalf of Bin Saoud— references which have in no way been courted, but which I cannot leave unanswered without incurring among the Chiefs concerned a reputa tion for personal negligence or discourtesy, which would be prejudicial to my work in other ways.” These papers were sent home for information in the ordinary course by the Government of India without comment in January 1907. In a telegram dated the 9th February, 1907, the Government of India were asked for an expression of their views as to the answer to be returned to Sheikh Viceroy’s Jasim. They replied as follows on the 15th February 15,1907. 3f e b 1 l ia ry * “ We are sending despatch reviewing situation in Eastern Arabia, and suggesting that answer be conveyed to Bin Saoud to the effect that British Government, while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him so long as he com ports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with Arab Sheikhs on coast, see no necessity at present for making him any formal promises of the protection wffiich might even have effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to consolidation of his authority. Answer might be conveyed orally through Sheikh Jasim or such other agency as our Resident in the Persian Gulf may recommend.” Government of ^.The promised despatch was sent on the Februaryif 1907. February, 1907. In it the Government of India reviewed the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Nejd affairs since 1904. They expressed the view that matters were rapidly approaching a crisis, which would compel us to make up our minds as to our policy towards Central Arabia. They considered the prospects of Turkey ^reestablishing her authority in Eastern Arabialss£remote, and even contemplated the prospect of the Turks dis appearing altogether from the whole of Arabia south of Zobehr. At the same time they held1 . 10 that the establishment of the Wahabee power would be a menace to our position at Koweit as well as on the Pirate Coast. In regard to the question immediately at issue, they recommended that a reply should he returned to Bin Saoud’s overtures in the terms set forth in their telegram of the 15th February. Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted, took the Sir N. O’Conor, view that it would be most unwise for His Majesty’s Government to entangle themselves with Bin Saoud or in any other way to interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. The renly of His Majesty’s Government to the Mr. Morley to x e t- t &gt; , Government of Government of India s representations was con- veyed in Mr. Morley’s despatch of the 3rd May, May 3,190/. 1907, in the following terms :—■ “ After carefully considering, in consultation with His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople, the views expressed by you r Excellency’s Government as to the general situation in Central Arabia, His Majesty’s Government see no reason to modify the policy laid down in my predecessor’s telegram of the 30th Decem ber, 1901, and repeated in my telegram of the 9th November, 1900, that British interests and influence in those regions should be strictly confined to the co?.st; and they agree with Sir N. O’Conor that it would be most unwise for them to entangle themselves with the Wahahee Amir or in any other way to interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. “ The terms of the reply, which in paragraph 11 of your letter you propose to return to Bin Saoud, appear to His Majesty’s Government to be open to objection, as implying an approval of the consolidation of the Wahabee power, and consequently a certain interference in Arabian affairs. No such communication should there fore be made. But if Major Cox finds it impossible to avoid giving some answer to those who have approached him on the Wahabee Amir’s behalf, he should inform them, as Bin Saoud’s proposals involve considerations which it . is impossible for His Majesty’s Government to maintain, that no reply is to be expected.” So far as is known. Bin Saoud’s advances were not renewed during the year 1907. 2 1 1&lt;)Z8 r g / 6 7 oIn any farther communica tion on this subject, please quote no. 22135. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

(16416) CONST JSNTINOPLE, May 15th 1907 Sir:- I have the honour to tranenit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Basra, re specting events in Central Arabia. The news of Bln Saood's defeat, if true, is important, especially if it is the issue of fighting on a large scale, such as was anticipated in the second of the reports from Mr. consul Devey, Inclosed in my despatch No. 5 , 91 K1) 257 of April 30th. It seems to me to show the impolicy of inter vention on the part of His Majesty's Government in the entanglements of internal conflicts between the Arab tribes, and to confirm the view as to the prudence of abstention, which I expressed in my ^4*1 despatch No.198 Confidential of April 1st. The influence of His Majesty's Government should however, I think, be exercised on Sheikh Mubarak to Sir E. Grey, Bart., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c preventprevent his undertaking military operations, save in self-defence. If we do not show our displeasure at aggressive action on his part, he may presume on our support and I venture again to repeat that I am by no means sure that if Pertev Pasha, the Chief of Staff of the 6th Army Corps, who has now been ordered to Basra to restore order there, were to organize a punitive expedition against Mubarek, he would not be successful. The result would produce a very complicated sit uation in which we might be called upon to intervene. I never felt assured that any overtures made to Bin Saood, whether through Mubarek or otherwise, would not be revealed to the Turkish Government and the fact that he is now sending a messenger to Constantinople makes me think that His Majesty s Government were well advised in discountenancing any project of that kind. (Signed) I have &amp;c., N.R.O*Conor.No. 31 BASRA, April 17th 1907. Sir:- T I have received the following information from the Political Agent at Koweit regarding events in Central Arabia. Mohamed Bin Ithnaln, Sheikh of the Sbi f a tribe broke off hie alliance with Bin Saud, because the latter had killed two of his followers for intrigu ing, and sought refuge with Sheikh Mubarek of Kow eit on March 5th last. He was kindly received but advised to return to hie own country. Bin Saud is said to have tried to raid the Shammars, but the latter collected in force and Bin Saud retreated to Boreyda. By order of the Sheikh of Koweit, heavy dues are levied on the Haj caravan from Koweit to Mecca £T5 on each woman 1 s litter and £T1 on each camel ri der. He.15 per head were levied on 114 slaves brought from Mecca to Koweit by the Haj caravan. His Excellency Customs The Right Honourable Sir N. R. 0*Conor, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.Customs duties are being raised all round. The Sheikh of Koweit is preparing to raid the Ajman tribe of Bedouins for stealing 20 herds from Koweit Bedouins in February last. About 2,000 towns men, exclusive of Bedouins, have been enlisted and all the Haj camels and their furniture, as well as a cargo of arms which lately arrived, have been commandeered by the Sheikh of Koweit for the foray. The Umtair and Thaffer Bedouins are assisting Sheikh Mibarek in the business, and the latter is forming his camp at Sirra. The news received at Basra regarding Nejd events is meagre. Izzet Pasha,late Commandant at Basra, received permission to proceed to Constanti nople with two followers of Bin Sand named Salih U1 Addil, former Sheikh of Hass, who was a partisan of Bin Reshid and came over to Bin Saud's side after the former’s death, and Ibrahim el Darner. These two gentlemen, who proceed to Constantinople to do homage to the Sultan on behalf of Bin Saud, left by the Burhanieh for Bagdad on April 10th. They received from the Turkish Government £T450 for journ-journey expenses and an oufit allowance of £T5 and are each accompanied hy a scri'oe and a servant. On April 13th a letter reached the Vilayet of Basra to the effect that Sultan el Hamud had fought with the Arabs of Bln Ssud near Kasim and killed many of them.

Sir:- j With reference to iny despatch No* 198 of the 1st instant, I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of two despatches from His Majesty's Consul at rfenas- CUS respecting affairs in the Nejd. In the first of these despatches Mr. Devey gives a new version of the circumstances in which Mut'ib er Rashid was murdered, and relates a ghastly tale of treachery. In the second despatch he gives an account of the relations between Ibn Saoud and the new Emir of Hail. It appears that Ibn Saoud replied to Sultan-ibn-Rash id's offer of friendship by an intolerable list of conditions, and that as a result Sultan-ibn-Rashid has raised a very considerable force with which to attack Ibn Saoud. No fighting has yet taken place but Mr. Devey anticipates that it will end in favour of Ibn Saoud. I have &amp;c., (Signed) N. R. O'Conor. e Right Honourable Sir E.

The plot against the life of MuVib and his broth ers was organized by Sultan in the following way: First of all Sultan persuaded Mut’ib to send his mother (sister of Sultan) to Mecca for the Haj and to escort her with a large number of his most faithful servants and attendants including Ikab, the bravest and most daring of the bodyguards of MuVib, and Abdur- Rahman, the wisest and most devoted of his advisers. Securing Honourable F. R. 0*Conor, G.C.B., G.C.M.G.,Securing the success of this first step by which Mut'ib was deprived of his best men, Sultan proposed to him an ibex shooting party far away from Hail to which pro position MuVib innocently agreed. The members of the party were Mut'ib, his two brothers Mashaal and Moham med and his cousin Telal on one side, and Sultan, his two brothers Sooud and Feissal, and his cousin Dhari on the other, with a big number of servants and attend ants* After they lunched at a certain fountain in the open country Sultan suggested that the eight of them would go ahead and leave their followers at lunch. Mut'ib accepted the suggestion and the above mentioned eight chiefs rode together side by side. When they were at a distance far enough from the camp, Sultan and his brothers and cousin, in execution of their plot, rode alongside of the others and at a signal from Sultan shot them dead. Sultan killed Mut'ib, Sooud killed Mashaal, Felssal killed Mohammed and Dhari killed Te lal* They rode back to the camp and told that Telal killed Mut'ib and his brothers and that they, the mur derers, avenged for their death and killed Telal. Consequently Sultan was proclaimed Emir of Shammer at thethe. camp and inarched back to Hail triumphantly• He broke the news to the whole tribe and to the neighbour ing chiefs and finally to the Turkish authorities at Medina, Damascus and Constantinople in the same form as stated in the despatch under reference* Hamoud er-Rash id, the father of Sultan, was greatly displeased by the cruelty of his son towards his grand sons and in mark of his disapproval of those atroci ties he left Hail and started to Medina where he ar rived yesterday to spend the remaining days of his life there. He telegraphed his arrival at Medina to one of his friends here. I have &amp;c.. (Signed) G. P. Devey.DAMASCUS. 3.18. A P ri l 15th, 1907. Sir:- Witn reference to my despatch No. 16 of the 8th instant I have the honour to submit to Your Excellency the following report on the actual relations between Sultan ibn-Rashid and Abdul-Az iz ibn-Sooud of the Nejd with the events that took place since the succession of the former to the Principality of Jebel Shammer at Hail. When Sultan became the master of Hail he wrote to Ibn Sooud who was then at Bureiden of Kassira telling him of the events which led to his succession and ask ing him to recognize that change, proposing at the earn time friendly relations between Hail and Riadh. Ibn Sooud replied that he would be glad to maintain the good relations and accept the friendliness offered on the following conditions: 1* the members of Abul-Kheil family of Bureideh, rival of Ibn Sooud, now refugees at Hail, should be expelled from that town. 2 . s Excellency The Right Honourable Sir N. O’Conor. G.C.B.. G.C.M.G..2. The 30 swords and 300 Martini rilfes taken from Ibn Sooud’s men by Mohammed ibn Rashid 20 years ago should be returned. 3. The two cannon at Hail given by the Turkish Government must be handed over to Ibn Sooud. 4. The Muteir Tribe which frequently annoys Ibn Sooud by its raids against his partisans should be fought by Ibn Rashid. 5. Ibn Rashid should not communicate or conclude treaties with any people beyond Jebel Shammer except through Ibn Sooud. 6. Ibn Rashid would not be allowed to march with a standard of his own unless authorized by Ibn Sooud to do so. 7. The expenses of the recent mobilizations at Kassim amounting to £T.5 # 000 incurred by Ibn Sooud for an expedition against Mutib, the late Prince, should be paid by Ibn Rashid. Certainly Ibn Rashid refused to agree to these hard terms and marched out from Hail with 4,000 cavalry and about 15,000 camel riders to meet Ibn Sooud who was at the head of a considerable force coming from KassimKasslm to Hail in support of his denands. Seeing that his forces were Inferior to those of his rival, Ibn Sooud, who never anticipated that Sultan ibn Rashid the murderer of his cousins, the usurper of their posts and the newly proclained prince, would be able to have such a large force under him, at once retired and re- crossed the path hack to Kassim, where he is now calling his various allies for his help. Sultan ibn Rashid is at the present moment camping at a place called Kehefa one day journey from the fron tier of Kassim, and as soon as the mobilizations of Ibn Sooud are complete probably an action will take place between the two rival princes, the issue of which will be, with probability, in favour of the latter.

I have the honour to inform you th it one Nasir, a relation of the Amir of Hail, has arrived at Koweit and that Sheikh Mubarak informs mo that he has been sent by Bin Rashid in order to inform the Sheikh of Koweit of all that has occurred recently at Hail and notably of the murder of Metaab Bin Abdul Azaz Bin Rashid, the late Amir of Hail, and his two brothers. 2. According to Sheikli Mubarak, Nasir has brought letters in which Sultan practically puts himself at Sheikh Mubarak’s disposal, is ready to listen to all his advice, and hopes for his friendship and protection. The letters may not be all that Sheikh Mubarek describes th^m to be and, even if they are, are probably only half sincere, but the fact that Sultan has, at once, sent a near relative to inform the Sheikh is of significance, as showing how far Mubarak s influence extends. 3. The Sheikh states that there is no lineal descendant left of Abdullah Bin Rashid, and that, of the sons of Harnood Bin Obeid, only three are left, as all the others were gradually killed off during the recent troubles and fighting between Bin Rashid and Bin Saood. 4. The three sons referred to are Sultan, who has now assumed the title of Amir, and Saood and Faisul. Apparently it was Sultan who is responsible for th™murder of the young sou, of The Amir Abdul Aziz. The ^r^s received in Koweit, goes that the young boys were out hawking and Sultan ^me and ioined them. He had consulted his father, Hamood, who endeavoured in vafn to diesuade him from his design. He left a slave with ^ ™ boys with instruetions to kill them, as soon as he heard a shot hred de himself rode out with Metaab who had no suspicion th ®,we^ then was easily shot by the traitor from behind. The two h tle boys wer . h murdered by the slave. It is surmised in Koweit that Sultan had me previous understanding with Bin Saood. i, -n* 5 The Sheikh is of the opinion that all this tends to strengthen Bin Snood’s nosition and he says that the latter will probably now take Hail.

At first they hardly repl.ed o his letters and now they are excessively civil to him and exhort him incessantly “ to keep fSe» at a distant.” It is impossible to put on paper the eusto with which the Sheikh repeated this phrase to me, but, with the mischievous Arab nature, he seemed thoroughly to enjoy the spectacle of his lor dsand masters, the Ottoman authorities imploring their turbulent vassal to koep “ those devils out.

I have the honour to report that in the first week of January last, Sultan maternal uncle of lut-ah the Amir of Nejd, assassinated the Amir Iut-ab, his younger brother Mash-al, and their cousin Talal-en- naif and assumed the title of Amir of Nejd. Mien this happened in Nejd, Nut-ab's mother was on her way to Medina for pilgrimage, with Talal’s uncle Ab dulla Obeid. She does not intend to return to Nejd, and desires to reside at Medina. She is also taking steps to bring to Medina her youngest son, who is a youth of 10 years age and v/ho has miraculously escaped murder at the wands of Sultan, though was three times fired upon. It is said here that Sultan the murderer of Mut-ab is on very friendly relations w.th Bin Saood and all that he has done, has been done with a pre vious understanding between the two.

Bin overtures to Great Britain and the passage of Turkish troops through Koioeit. in Nejd, I forward herewith, for the information of Your Excel lency in Council, copy of corre spondence* with the Foreign Office on the subject. * To Foreign Office, dated 27th March 1S07. From ditto, dated 16th April 1907, with enclosure. 2. After carefully considering, in consultation with His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, the views expressed by Your Excellency s Government as to the general situation in Central Arabia, His Majesty s Government see no reason «.o modify the policy laid down in my predecessor’s telegram of the 30th December 1904, and repeated m my telegram of the 9th ISovembei 1906, that British interests and influence in those regions should be strictly confined to the coast; and they agree with Sir N. O Conoi that it would be most unwise for them to entangle themselves with the Wahabi Amir, or in any other way to interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. 3 . The terms of the reply which, in paragraph 11 of your letter, you propose to return to Bin Saood, appear to His Majesty’s Govern ment to be open to objection as implying an approval of tire consoli dation of the Wahabi power, and consequently a certain interference in Arabian affairs. No such communication should therefore be made- But if Major Cox finds it impossible to avoid giving some answer to those who have approached him on the Wahabi Amir’s behalf, be should inform them, as Bin Saood’s proposals involve considerations which it is impossible for His Majesty’s Government to entertain, that no reply is to be expected. 4. With regard to your further proposal that representations should he made to 1116°Porte regarding the passage through Koweit of Turkish troops on their way back from the interior, Sir N. O’Conor is ot opinionBOB mammmamatBmBmmM ENCLOSURE. Enclosure No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 27tli March 1907. In continuation of previous correspondence relative to affairs in Nejd, ending with the telegram from tlie Viceroy of the 15th February last, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to forward, for the consi deration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter from the Government of India, No. 28 (Secret), of 21st February, and enclosures, reviewing the situation and making certain proposals. The first of these proposals is to send a message to Sheikh Ja«im, for repetition to the Wahabi Emir, to the effect stated in the 11th para graph of the enclosed letter. To this Mr. Morley sees no objection, with the omission of the words “under present circumstances,” and “formal,” provided that the message is conveyed in writing so as to avoid the danger of misrepresentation. But he would be glad to be favoured with Sir E Grey’s views upon the subject. The second proposal is that, in view of the recent passage of considerable bodies of Turkish troops through Koweit, a warning should be addressed to the Sublime Porte in the sense of Lord Lansdowne’s Despatch to Sir N. O’Conor, No. 177, of the 10th May 1904, together with an intimation that, if troops are again moved through Koweit territory on their passage to or from Nejd, His Majesty’s Government will be forced to consider what action should be taken to protect their own interests. In view of the fact, stated by the Government of India, that the passage of the troops in question is merely the withdrawal of beaten troops from the interior, it does not appear to Mr. Morley that there are the same 'rounds for a representation to the Porte which existed when Lord Lansdowne’s Despatch above quoted was written; and he is not prepared to suoport this proposal. . With regard to Hie general question of policy discussed in the earlier paragraphs of this letter Mr. Morley sees no reason at present to alter the policy stated in paragraph u, viz., that of strictly confining our interests and influence to the coast line of Eastern Arabia. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Foreign Office. Sir, No. 11,067. Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, 16th April 1907. I am directed by Secretary Sir E.

In reply I am to transmit to you, to be laid beforcMr. Secretary Morley, cf py of a Despatch which has since been received from His A 2 S. 16 .^Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, commenting on the same letter, which was simultaneously forwarded to Flis Excellency. Sir N. O’Conor, in discussing the situation and outlook, strongly urges that it would be most unwise for His Majesty’s Government to entangle themselves with Ibn Saood or in any other way interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. Sir E. Grey is disposed to concur in this view, and he considers that it would be therefore inadvisable to carry out the proposal of the Government of India contained in paragraph 11 of their Despatch, even as amended in accordance with Mr. Morley’s suggestions, as this would imply an approval of the consolidation of Ibn Saood’s authority, and consequentlv a certain interference in Arabian affairs. Sir E. Grey equally concurs in Sir N. O’Conor’s suggestion that representations to the Porte with reference to the passage of some Turkish troops through Koweit territory would be undesirable at this distance of time from the actual event. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State E. A. Campbell. for India. Annex. Sir N. O’Conor to Eoreign Office. No. 198. (Confidential.) Constantinople, Sir, 1st April 1907. I have the honour to inform you that I have received from the Government of India a copy of their Despatch to Mr. Morley, No. 28 (Secret), of 1907, and I venture to offer the following remarks on its contents. It is difficult to forecast events in Turkey and particularly so in Arabia, where the Ottoman Government have so olten re-established authority which seemed to have passed from their grasp. But it looks just now as if Ibn Saood might possibly consolidate a Wahabee dynasty by the absorption of Nejd, the practical expulsion of the Turks from Xassim and Boreyda, and by establishing friendly relations with Sheikh Jasim of Katr and the Hassa regions. At the same time it would be unwise to conclude that the Turkish Government cannot recover their ground, or that Ibn Saood will be able to amalgamate tribal interests in such a manner as to resist the forces of the Suzerain Power and continue his victorious course. It may be that all that is national, in feeling and aspiration, may group itself around Ibn Saood, but all the elements of a firm and stable regime are well nigh wanting so far, and I should be slow to assume that we are on the eve of important changes in those parts. Moreover, Ibn Saood has not yet had to deal with a large Turkish military force, partly owing to tribal disturbances, and partly to bis double-faced policy towards the Sultan. It is by no means certain, however, that if he openly declares his hostility to the Caliph, the energetic commandant of the Sixth Army Corps, Pertev Pasha, who is now reorganizing this corps at Bagdad, will not crush him before he has time or means for resistance. I confess I see nothing to be gained by entangling ourselves with him under present circumstances, and I do not see how^ we can, with political honesty, assist his insurrectionary movement against, for instance, El Hassa, which w~e recognise as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. We can hardly approach the Porte with a declaration, disguised how it may be diplomatically, that we shall protect a rebel who is in arms for the disintegration of the Empire. Even were we to do so, I should have no faith in the phenomenon of political gratitude from an Arab race.\ i Apart from this, I am not at all sure how far the establishment of a strong and fanatical Wahabee dynasty in those parts would serve our interests ; on the contrary, I am of opinion that our right policy is to interfere as little as possible with the internal affairs of these tribes, and let them work out their own destiny as best they can. If, in the course of time, Ibn Saood, or another, should succeed in establishing their rule and authority under some more or less stable order of Government, it might be necessary to consider whether we should recognise them as representative of the will of the people, and even, perhaps, to consider how far it would he desirable to protect their coasts from predatory or other attacks. But this is some way off, and before a confederacy of the Arab states of JMohammerah, Koweit, and Nejd is in existence, the chances are that the present Ottoman regime will have come to an end and. be succeeded by a nationalist and popular Government, or that the disintegration of the component parts of the Empire will have begun. In the latter case we cannot escape our responsibilities, but I should be sorry to see England enter into relations with a new Turkish regime, having previously agreed to a secret arrangement with Ibn Sacod for the disruption of the Empire. The Moslems of this country would never forgive nor forget such a policy. As regards the idea that I should be instructed to make representa tions to the Porte with reference to the passage of some Turkish troops through Koweit territory, I venture to submit that if these expostula tions had been made within even a few months of the circumstance complained of, it might have been in place, but if we raised such a question after a lapse of eight months, it would provoke much ill-feeling without, so far as I can see, any corresponding advantages. If we want to assert our predominance in Koweit, I would on the whole prefer to insist upon the evacuation of Bubian Island should Ottoman gendarmes still be there. But this I do not advocate at present, although at some future time we may have to remind ihe Porte of the subject. I quite understand the unpleasant position in which Major Cox is placed by not being able to reply satisfactorily to the overtures of Ibn Saood or Sheikh Jasim, but I do not see how this can be avoided, and after all it is better than pledging ourselves to unknown risks and responsibilities. As regards a descent of Ibn Saood on the Oman coast and ins assistance in repressing piracy and his influence with the Trueial duels, I venture to think that there is as little chance of his being able to he really uselul to us as there is of his daring to attack the maritime Chiefs who are under our protection. It would be well, however, carefully to Avatch the proceedings and policy of this somewhat active Sheikh while strictly maintaining with the Sheikh of Koweit the engagements Avhich we have undertaken.

Major Cox, our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, desires to be in a position to give a definite answer to these overtures, and has recommended in his letter No. 2181, dated the 16th September 1906, that we should take the present opportunity to come to terms with the Wahabi Chief, on the following grounds :— (1) that overtures have been made at various times by Bin Saood himself, and by Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani and Sheikh Mubarak on Bin Saood’s behalf, with a view to securing for the latter some measure of British protection, and that if we neglect these overtures, Bin Saood and his following may icgaid us with hostility; 2) that if a friendly understanding were to exist between the British Government and Bin Saood, both the 8ultan of Mnskat and the Trucial Chiefs w r ould be fortified by the knowledge that any attempt on the part of the Wahabi to make a descent upon Oman would involve a preliminary rupture between him and the British Government; 1 3) that if Bin Saood w^ere our friend be would be able to assist us in sunnressine: piracies in the northern part of the Gull, rnVS we do no J t respond, tSey may approach some other Power.BEBBBHBI 3 Proposals have heen made on previous occasions for British interven- ? ,/ r T ”.‘‘ r , f Np : d but it has been decided on each occasion that it tion m the affairs of Nejd, would be inelpedien t to incur the diffi- * Government of India despatch &gt;o. 69 (Secret). ^ embarrassments involved. ^ tbe 24th M M 'ch l904, proposals were made* for adopting a course which might + Mr. Brodriek , 's despatch No. 24 (Secret), dated the 29th April 1»04. of the status quo in other hand, it was 100 ijo ^ it was inadvisable Government should be committed to ary course of action which would appear to encourage that family or which could he represented by the Turkish Govern ment as a 'breach of the understanding between the two Governments for the maintenance t Vide letter from Sir N O’Conor to the Marquess • v of Lansdowne, No. 129, dated the 26th February JN ej(l. . 1904 . recognised^ as very important that the British Government should be in a position to decide as to the policy to be followed in case of a serious revolutionary outbreak m .Nejd and the cessation of Ottoman rule in El Hasa. Your predecessor therefore hinted that in the event of an alteration of conditions m Nejd m the above-mentioned direction, he might be prepared to consider further a proposal for sending a British officer to Riadh on a mission of enquiry. 4 In May 1904, on hearing that the Turks were collecting troops § Telegram to His Majesty’s Secretary of State to assist Bin Rashid the Government for India, dated the 29th May 1904. of India SUggested§ to MlS Majesty S Government that representations might he made by Sir N. O’Conor to the Porte in order to prevent this. It was urged that our interests in Eastern and Southern Arabia were such that we could not view with indifference intervention on behalf of one of the parties contending for power in Nejd, and that onr prestige at Koweit must suffer materially if we permitted Turkish influence to determine the supremacy of the Turkish nominee against Bin Saood, Mubarak’s friend. It was further pointed out that Turkish supremacy in Nejd might involve the destruction of Mubarak’s influence and a possible attack on Koweit territory. 5. This view was not altogether accepted by His Majesty’s Government, 1 ) Vide letter from sir n. o’Conor to the M.rque,* but on 15th May, Sir N. O’Conor drewj| of Laosdowne, No. 373, dated the 16th May 1904. the attention of the Porte to the understanding arrived at between tbe Porte and the British Government with regard to Koweit. He said that, as His Majesty’s Government had on several occasions cautioned the Sheikh of Koweit to refrain from interfering in neighbouring disturbances, they had a right to expect that the Ottoman Government would do what it could to restrain the Amir of Nejd and refrain frotn any action which might endanger peace in those regions, whose tran quillity was a matter of interest to His Majesty’s Government as well as to that of the Sultan. Sir N. O’Conor gave it as his opinion that he could not press the Turks to desist from sending assistance to Bin Rashid without appearing to be a partisan of Bin Saood. His idea was that we should confine ourselves, at all events for the present, to maintaining intact the territory of Koweit and to watching developments. 6. This policy appears to have been adopted by His Majesty’s Government as, in a telegram, dated 30th December 1904, your predecessor said that His Majesty’s Government desired that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence were to be confined strictly to the coast line of Eastern Arabia, and that nothing should be said or done to connect them even indirectly with warfare in progress in the interior. Me recently received similar instructions from you in your telegram, dated 9th November 1906 which disposed of tbe suggestion made by Major Cox. 7. We have already issued the necessary orders to Major Cox to ensure strict adherence to the line of policy which has heen laid down, hut in the meanwhile we think it our duty to point out that there are indications in the papers received since Major Cox’s letter of 16th September 1906 was written, that the position of the Turks in Nejd is becoming increasingly difficult, and that they have been unable to do more than maintain a mere semblance'of power « {th . j/r'•Lm pf 0 * 1 in Hassa where they have recently sustained a somewhat serious reverse at the hands of the local Arabs. They are now trying to re-establish their position there by the despatch of troops, and it was rumoured that they intended to use Bahrein as an intermediate base though this intention was not carried out and the troops were sent direct to Katif. On the other hand, the ^fcreater part if not the whole of the Turkish garrisons are stated to have been ^uthdrawn from Nejd and Kasim in a pitiable condition and the plans of the Wahabi Chief for dislodging the Turks from Nejd and the Arab littoral seem now to be more within the bounds of possibility. Although it is possible that, * nde despatch from Sir n. O’Conor to sir as anticipated in Mr. Lloyd’s Memoran- Edward Grey, No. 007 , dated the 24 th July 1906 . dum* respecting German influence on the Hedjaz Railway, the completion of the line to Medain-Saleh will affect the balance of power in western Nejd in favour of the Turks, yet it will be a long time before the posts which have been abandoned can be re-occupied by reinforcements from the railway. 8. On the whole it seems to us that the situation is developing towards the point at which Sir N. O’Conor in 1904 anticipated that it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government See letter No. 129 (Confidential), dated the 26th ^ ji - i ‘ j ji ^ i • February 1904, to the Marquess of Lansdowne. ^ make Up their minds as to the policy to be followed in regard to Nejd. The question is one primarily for decision by His Majesty’s Government, and we hesitate to offer our advice in a matter in which India is only interested in a t vide your despatch No. 36 (Secret), dated the secondary degree!' and merely because a sth October 1906 . disturbance of the position on the Arabian coast might adversely affect Indian trade and our political arrangements in the Gulf. In view however of the rapid aggrandisement of Bin Saood as indi cated by the recent reports, we venture to call attention to the opinion expressed by Sir N. O’Conor in his letter to the Marquess of Lansdowne, No. 373, dated 16th May 1904, that if Bin Saood succeeds in re-establishing a Wahabi dynasty throughout the centre of Arabia, the result might render our influ ence and authority at Koweit precarious. W&lt; Mould also invite a perusal of our Secret despatch No. 7 (External), dated the 11th January 1906, in which we showed that the growing importance of this Chief, if he is hostile to our interests, is a danger to our relations with the Trucial Chiefs. If the Turks are really likely to disappear from the stage, and if Bin Saood is to be a power in the land, it seems to us desirable that this Chief should, when a suitable moment arrives, he led to come to a friendly understanding with us. 9. Bin Saood has made a definite request,^ through Sheikh Jasim, that a secret understanding may be arranged X Enioosure No. ii. between the British Government and himself under which he may he granted British protection from Turkish assaults at sea in the event of his ever succeeding in driving the Turks unaided out of his ancestral dominions. Having regard to our relations with the Turks, it would of course he impossible that even a secret undertaking to this effect should be given to the Wahabi Chief at present. Ihe difficulty is, however, that, if we hold back too long, wc risk the possibility that Lin Saood may succeed in obtaining control over Hassa and Katif without any reference to us, either by arrangement with the Turks, as their representative, or by his own unaided efforts. Either of these alternatives might be disadvantageous to us. We do not want Turkish power consolidated in Nejd, as our influence over Koweit and the Trucial Chiefs might he weakened; similarly, if Bin Saood obtained unquestioned authority in Nejd and Hassa and Katif, he would be a disturbing influence in coast politics if he were not attached to us m some way. 10 But on the other hand, it is unlikely that the lurks would foimally hand over full authority in Nejd, Hassa, and Eatif to Bin Saood in response to the application winch he proposes to make to the Sultan for the Governorship ^ of these districts. Even if they did so, | See Captain Prideaux’s letter No. 600, dated Lin Saood, by his OWU admissioU,§ WOuld the 17th November 1906 (aimexure to enclosure res t content with this, but No,11) ‘ would seize the first opportunity of throwing off the Turkish yoke.

The risk of the lease of harbours to other maritime powers m the gult would also be greatly decreased. 11. In the meanwhile, as some reply seems to he necessary to the reiterated enquiries which have been made by, or on behalf of, Bin Sa ood, we propose, subject to your approval, to convey an answer to him to the effect that the British Government, while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him, so long as he comports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with Arab Sheikhs on the coast, see no necessity, under present conditions, for making him any formal promises of protection which might even have the effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to the consolid ation of his authority. 12. Our anxiety as to the possible effect of the recent changes in Nejd has been heightened by the recent passage of considerable bodies of Turkish troops through Koweit, a proceeding which is in contravention of the terms of the status quo Agreement of 1901 by which the Turks undertook not to send troops to Koweit. It is true that the undertaking which the Porte gave related primarily to the offensive movement of troops by sea to Koweit’and did not contemplate such a situation as the present in which the Turks have withdrawn beaten troops by land through Koweit. Still, in our opinion, if the occurrence is allowed to pass unnoticed it will form an inconvenient precedent as tending to bring the Sheikh more directly under Turkish authority or even to facilitate a coup de main on Koweit. if it is repeated and the Sheikh resents it, there is some danger that he may take direct measures to stop the passage of military parties through his territories, and this might at any moment lead to a disagreeable incident necessitating action on our part which it is desirable, if possible, to avoid. According to a report* from * Enclosure j&gt;o. 15 . Major Knox the Sheikh has already, on one occasion, felt himself able to refuse to permit some Turkish refugees to enter Koweit and he might now welcome some support on this point from us. This would have the incidental advantage of strengthening our influence at this important point, which is desirable in view of the uncertainty which Sheikh Mubarak apparently feels as to the present policy of the British Government, which has led him to demur to introducing the new Koweit flag and to coquet more openly with the Turkish authorities at Basrah. We therefore invite His Majesty’s Government to consider whether the opportunity miErht not suitably he taken to warn the Turkish Government once more against taking action likely to “ and still further to the disturbed condition of this part of Arabia ” (see Lord Lansdowne’s despatch to Sir N. O’Conor, No. 177, dated the 10th May 1904), and to intimate to them that, if troops are again moved through Koweit territory on their passage to or from Nejd, His Majesty’s Government will be forced to consider what action should be taken to protect their own interests.18 %e a ppeat fctn Hmefll 5 wer“ ink it coast, i anil lice of M aa ild not lobelir, 'Wages ;illpit icgulf ;eratei ’opose, lat tlie 5 13.

With reference to my despatch No. 59 of August 25 th, I have the honour to report that I called on Lieutenant-General Sudqi Pasha last Wednesday* He had bren ordered to Baghdad and left the same evening. It is uncertain whether he will return to take up his appointment as Comnrandant at Basrah. Sudqi Pasha stated that he had handed over the Command in El Kasim to Sami Pasha, Acting Mutessarif and Commandant and stayed ten days with him after his arrival, Sami Pasha brought 500 soldiers and one gun with him from Medina. The troops arrived in excellent condition. According to Sudqi Pasha’s account there are 2,500 troops in Nejd and El Kasim. The lines of communications are open and caravans ^ arrive freely and, though supplies are not easily obtainable locally, all necessaries were for warded to them by caravans* Information from other sources does not confirm this favourable account. Fhe tale told by the numerous deserters who have from time to time found heir wav to Koweit and thence the Basrah during Sudqi Pasha’s command in Kasim is a very different one. They describe the state of the troops there as jitiable in the extreme and state that provisions are scarce and they are wit - DUt pay. Sudqi Pasha himself is said to be owed 2,000 Turkish £ for his services. Sudqi Pasha said that Ibn Saood was jealous of Saleh bin Mohanna s: intercourse with the Turkish Officers and that he got the P eo P le , . of to sign a. r ^ complaining of was appointed KaimakamorBoreyda by the Mushir, the appointment had not been confirmed by Constantinople* Pasha marched from Boreyda to Zilfi and thence travelled by way of Fs Sa?a and SubaTeya to Koweit, crossing the northern end of the Dahna of Ls bata and onwards he found water once every between Koweit and Kasim. 0 brought 14.2 men with four days.

J ust , at , th f time the revvs of .the death of Bin Rashid at the hands of his nval reached the coast and the situation seemed so kaleidoscopic that I delayed making any report, to Government until matters had crystallised somewhat. _. , ^ have now received from Captain Knox a communication from Sheikh Mubarak to much the &gt; same effect as the foregoing. We have thus been approached from three directions and I think there can be no doubt that these representations may be held to have been inspired by Bin Saood personally. 3. Bin Rashid s death at the hands of his rival had an important influence on the situation, and as die Government of India have been informed, the three cornered peace of which the possibility was indicated in paragraph 2 of my letter No. 620 of 18th March has lately taken shape. Whether rt will endure on its own merits or whether the Turks will at once set themselves to undo it, it is impossible to prophesy, but seeing that the present Bin Rashid is a mere youth of 18, it is hardly likely that he will be able to make any serious stand against Bin Saood for some time to come. The juncture is consequently a convenient one for an examination and review of the political situation in Central Arabia and of our attitude towards Bin Saood and 1 Venture to hope that Government will take advantage of it for that purpose. 4. While I believe I am right in thinking that His Majesty’s Government not to allow themselves to become involved in the tempestuous politics of Central Arabia. Nevertheless it must be conceded that we have principles and interests to consider other than the pursuit of the purely negative doctrine of aloofness above mentioned, and I cannot see that these are in any way served by our carrying that doctrine to an extreme point and by our treating the predomi nant Arab element in Nejd with an active neglect which not only places us in an (2) Foreign Department letter No. 3397-E.B., dated 8th October 1904. * ‘(l) Foreign Department telegram No. 1748- E.

Thus it will be remembered that Bin Saood formally appealed to us for ^ . r, * o f Drotection in a letter to me. dated 2 nd Vide telegram Resident to Foreign Department, P k U If C r 1 dated ,6ch May 1904. May t 904, but no reply on behalf of Gov-f^ ernment to that communication was ever authorised, and at the present time no practical modus vivendi between the Arab and ourselves can be said to exist. The inconvenience of this necame apparent in connection with the intention attributed to Bin Saood of visiting Oman, which has created so much apprehen sion in the minds of the Pirate Coast Chiefs during the past year. Had they known that any sort of friendly understanding existed between the Residency or Government and Bin Saood, both the Sultan of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs would have been fortified with the consequent knowledge that any attempt on the part of the Wahabi to make a descent upon Oman would involve a prehmi- nary rupture with us. In the absence cf any such entente all we could do was to get Sheikh Mubarak to give him a hint that any such action on his part would be regarded with disfavour by us. It is true that it appeared afterwards that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople had expressed the opinion , . * 1 ™ that we should deal with Bin Saood direct, Vide correspondence received with Foreign Ue- f , j , p&amp;^tment endor&gt;efnent No 2020-E.B., dated 17th ullt m 03 .n\vrill 6 it held uGCOIHG IlGCGSSciry tO May 1 06. action locally in the most expeditious way open to us. As a matter of fact this course met with a very courteous res- Residert to Foreign Department No. 773, dated ponSC from Bin Saood as reported tO GoV- sth April igoS. ernment at the time. 6. Another matter in regard to which we lose by not being on any sort of terms with the Wahabi is the question of piracy in the northern part of the Gulf. There is good reason to suppose that, bad we friendly relations with him, Bin Saood would be able to give us considerable assistance in running down noto rieties like the outlaw Ahmed bin Salman, who yearly commits more or less serious depredations during the pearling season. 7. At the present epoch, as before mentioned, peace reigns in the land, and if we have any intention of establishing some measure of friendly intercourse with the Ruler of Nejd, the present seems to be the time for us to do so. If on the other hand we persevere in our policy of ignoring him altogether and leaving his appeals unanswered and if we allow the Turks to revive the strife in Central Arabia, which theoretically they have now no excuse for doing, it will be small matter for wonder if we make him our bitter enemy for the future. I hesitate to make premature suggestions as to the terms which might figure in any agreement made, as I am aware that the problem is a delicate one and requires examination by a lens of longer focus than I can command, but I think I may say without temerity that I should welcome any degree of friendly understanding which would facilitate my dealings with the Trucial Chiefs and which would render it possible and unobjectionable for our officers to make occa sional tours in the country and thereby to acquire accurate information regarding the topography, tribes, and tribal politics of the interior, in respect of which our present store of knowledge is very meagre. In these latter connections, I solicit reference to the following items of pre vious correspondence : — (i) The latter part of letter No. 69, dated 26th March 1904, from the Government of India to the Secretary of State. (ii) Despatch from Sir Nicolas G’Conor to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No. 189, dated 20th March 1906, in which His Excellency advocated the arrangement of a meeting between Bin Saood and a British representative on one of our Gov ernment ships at some convenient point on the Coast.

One of the arguments he used was that, with Nejd in security and Bin baood under British protection, a caravan would start daily from Kovveit for the intenor and all its loads would be of Indian merchandise. He also said that nejd contained with the tribes upward of three millions of men. 3. It is clear that Bin Saood and probably Mubarak himself are uneasy about the late activity of the Turks in El Kasim, Sheikh Mubarak declares now that the Turkish soldiers in Nejd are still 3,000 men. 4. In reply, I said to Sheikh Mubarak that he might rest assured that I would report this conversation to you.[yn. 3. Telegram No. 378, dated the 2nd (received 3rd) October 1906. From— Major P. Z.

No special light is thrown, on the contingency suggested, by recent reports from Koweit and Mohammerah. On the other band recent developments in Nejd situation al ready reported, afford good reason for the supposition that the Arabs of Central Arabia, driven to desperation by persistent Turkish interference, are disposed to make common cause to throw off the yoke, and Sheikh Khazal may come in as adviser and friend (of) Mubarak, but I think that they all see the neces sity of enlisting the protective support of a Christian Power preferably our selves if we will give it effectively, and in time, and that they realise their inability to stand alone for long even as an Arab confederacy.

With reference to the Turkish occupation, * he informed me that there were only about 50 Turkish soldiers under * se« my note at end. a Kulaghasy at Boreida and a similar detachment at Aneza, and the main body, consisting of over a thou&amp;nd Infantry, a few Cavalry with 4 heavy field guns and 5 or 6 lighter piece A stationed at Sheihiya, a village about 5 or 6 hours ride West-North*West or Boreida, under the command of Sami Pasha. The Turks are there on sufferance, and do not interfere in any way with the local affairs, and confine themselves to their quarters, only leaving them when going to purchase food or going to the Mosque for prayers. The troops are rationed by their own Government. The Amir does not provide them with anything. They are wretchedly off. Many of the officers and men are continually deserting. If no fresh troops are sent to relieve the present garrison before long no soldiers will be left in Kassim through the wastage by disease and desertions. As regards the young Amir, he stated that the people of Jabal Shammar are very hopeful of him, and he has gained their affection through his straight forwardness, generosity, and the habit of carrying out no undertaking without consulting all the elders of the Al-Rashid clan and listening to the best advice. He has remitted the tribal taxes for the current year, and re-instituted the payment, of annual allowances to the various tribal chiefs, retainers, and chari ties on the same scale as that paid by his grandfather. These allowances had been reduced by his father. After reducing to obedience the Hoteim and Shararat tribes occupying the tract of country lying between Teima and Jowf, the Amir on about the last week of August 1906 attacked the Mateir Arabs, .adherents of Bin Sa’ud, in Kassim and carried away much plunder in the shape of camels, horses, cattle and sheep. Regarding the general feeling of the Arabs towards the Turks, my infor mant declared that there is a growing discontent and dislike towards them because of their unjust demands and harsh treatment, the life of the Arabs is becoming harder every year, and poverty is overshadowing them. Many of the Arab Chiefs whose incomes amount to 400 or 500 Liras, which would be sufficient under ordinary conditions for their needs, are reduced to beggary on account of the exactions of the Turkish officials. The Arabs are longing to whit Sir,!*b S S aw! not been paraphrased &gt; but is throw off the Turks and become indepen- dent or to come under the protection of the Great Powers as in the case of Bulgaria and Roumelia. With this view recently a Hithim Chief whose brother is imprisoned by the Turks and not yet released, though the amount of bribes demanded by the officials have been paid, has proposed to the Sheikh of the Muntafik Arabs the formation of a strong confederacy of all the tribes for the purpose of turning the Turks out of Arabia and applying subsequently to the Great Powers for protection. The Muntafik Sheikh did not fall in with the views of the Hiteim Sheikh as the rabs consider the Hiteim are of inferior blood and a proposal coming from such a source would not he taken up by other Arabs. x y lormant also informed me that cereals were very expensive in Jabal Mrammar and Kassim, and prices ranged five or six times as high as those on the Euphrates owing to the limited produce available in the regions mentioned. He explained tiiat the fields are irrigated by water drawn from wells by camels, and these animals cannot stand the werk, and in twm months they become useless and are sold for a fifth of their original price and though there is plenty of water and arable land, for this reason they find it just as cheap to ^ f r , am fro . m tlle districts on the Euphrates. He has heard of the ™ i P0 - rt f tl0 7 ” f .P u “P 3 luto Baghdad for purposes of irrigation and he is 3^ e w tedm ^ e , maUeras lle that these appliances would Wl „ ‘ ,rr h f ?T° Ur the 1 re S 10ns indicated as the whole of the cultivable . ntmaj be brought under cultivation by their employment. He understandsthat the price of Russian kerosine oil necessary for working the oil-engine which drives the pump is about 20 per cent dearer in Jabal Shammar than°at Koweit ti om where it will have to be procured, and that proper mechanics will have to be engaged to work the engines, &amp;c., from Baghdad at a higher rate of pay than they receive locally. He wishes to procure definite information as regards a pumping plant capable of raising a similar quantity of water as 10 or 11 Bakras* as*^w^ gs drawn by bullocks &gt; kn0wn in India a depth of 8 to 9 metres. When the , ' . details are forthcoming he proposes to transmit them to the Amir of Jabal Shammar and suggest to him the purchase o± such a pumping plant for erection at Havil as a trial. If the venture meets with success lie declares that over 200 plants will be required in the localities mentioned alone. He asked me whether I would assist him in obtaining the etans of a suitable plant—a plant that can be carried in pieces weighing from 2 to cwts. each for transport by camel. In respect of the appearance of several sections of the Aneza tribe of Arabs on the Euphrates between Musayib and Nedjef he stated that it was nothino* unusual. He explained that it was customary for these Arabs to camp in that neighbourhood during this season of the year so long as the grazing round about supported their camels, cattle and flocks. About 15 years ago the Aneza fell out with the Amir of Jabal Shammar and to avoid being raided by the Amir they kept aloof from the lower reaches of the Euphrates, but now that they have come to an understanding with the Amir they need no longer take that precaution. There are several thousands of tents scattered in groups of 200 to 500 throughout the region mentioned. 24th September 1906. J. C. GASKIN. Note by Major Ramsay. Mr. Gaskin’s informant is in a position to have the latest and most accu rate information of what is going on in the Ibn Rashid camp and counsels. The interview took place in the house of an Indian Resident of Baghdad. I did not take part in it as my movements are carefully watched. Mut’ib Ibn Rashid is said to have received an order on the Karbala District for £ T. 250 a month. This is not regularly paid and the local offi cials are trying to get a bribe to induce them to pay : this Mut’ib has refused to pay. Erom another source I hear that the Sultan’s Aide-de-Camp, who went to take a decoration to Mut’ib, had got as far as Havil. J. BAMSAY, Major. 29th September 1906.I* ; \ I ^s.X Confidenti . /.

I write to let you know that Mubarak was again talking about Nejd and repeating how anxious Bin Saood was for protection. He assured me that, whether helped by us or not, Bin Saood would certainly fight before submitting to the Turkish demands and that the people of Nejd would fight too. This is probably true as long as their side is winning but Abdul Aziz bin Saood has many enemies who would of course turn against him without hesitation at the first reverse. ****«»*• Extract from a news-letter, dated 26 th September igo 6 , from Captain S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E.y Political Resident in the Persian Gulf The following news has reached me with reference to the situation in Nejd and seems to me to have its own significance. The Turkish authorities are said to have addressed ^ letter to Meta’ab bin Rashid enquiring why he made peace with Abdul Aziz bin Saood and informing him that he had no authority to do so. The Fariq, who passed through Koweit the other day, is said to have addressed the people of El Kassim in the following terms ' I do not wish to offer you advice and I admit that the soldiers we have here are not sufficient to take El Kassim and that you are more numerous and as well armed as we are. But, if 5°° of us are kllled and we kll ! T 2 P° of we can replace our 500 , but whence will you replace your 200 ? Nejd is a bit 0 string: whereas the Turkish Government is like a bit of elastic and the Turkish Government must have El Kassim. Would it not be as well for you to put up with the light burden it is now sought to impose on you, rather than go througb the process I have described ? ” From the way this story was told and came into the conversation, I do not think that it was made up for my benefit.

In continuation of my letter marginally noted, giving cover to a copy of Mr. Resident to Foreign, No. 2139, dated the 15th Crow’s despatch No. 62 of August September 1906. ^ igo6 to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, on the subject of his interview with Sudgi Pasha, and referring also to the allowances paid by the Porte to the rivals in Nejd, I have the honour Koweit, No. 379 , dated the 30th September ,906. t0 S ° f ,? “P 0 ? wllich 1 haVe received from the Political Agent, Koweit, in reply to an enquiry on the latter subject, for the information of the Government of India. A copy is also being forwarded to His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. 2 , I take the opportunity to mention at the same time that I have since had an opportunity of discussing with Major Knox the subject of Sudgi Pasha’s return from Nejd with 300 men vid Koweity which was reported in article 1039 of this Office Diary for the week ending 2 nd September ; and have the honour to invite consideration to an aspect of the incident which inevitably suggests itself. It will doubtless have been noticed that the Turkish Officer and his men were got out of the place by Sheikh Mubarak with all possible despatch and although Sheikh Mubarak and his subjects would probably be too proud to admit that their presence in Koweit caused any actual trepidation, it can hardly be doubted that the pulses of both one and the other were considerably quickened by the unwelcome visitation. On this occasion their arrival was fortuitous and their intentions were doubt less innocuous, but as a precedent the incident is a somewhat inconvenient one, for it is possible to conceive that the experiment might be repeated with a larger force from Nejd or Baghdad, and that having arrived by this means a Turkish force might for the time being easily possess themselves of the town and of Sheikh Mubarak by a coup de main similar to that which the Bedouins effected in Maskat in 1895 . 3 . I venture to draw attention to the possibility, in case it might be con sidered desirable for us to give Sheikh Mubarak any advice on the subject for future guidance, or to suggest to the Porte that the course taken in this case seems to us open to objection and calculated to disturb unnecessarily the minds of the Koweit public, including British subjects. If the Porte wants to put troops into Nejd, or get them out of Nejd, it is reasonable to argue that they should use Ojair for the purpose and not the territory of a neutral Chief. No. 379 , dated the 30 th September 1906 . From— Captain S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 2140 , dated 15 th September 1906 , on the subject of the allowances paid to Bin Saood and Bin Rashid by the Turkish Government. 2 . In reply, I have the honour to inform you that Sheikh Mubarak informs me that the allowances are fixed as follows For Abdur Rahman bin Feysul bin Saood, Turkish £ 90 per mensem. For Meta’ab bin Rashid, 200 tigars rice per annum and Turkish £200 per mensem.Irt addition to the above, Meta’ab’s predecessors used to receive presents of arms and ammunition. O Sheikh Mubarak says that the allowances to Bin are paid through t , M'd aiihorities and that Yusuf Pasha bin Mandil, a Basrah merchant, draws the Saood allowances from the Basrah authorities and remits them by cheque to Abdulla Nafisi, a Koweit shopkeeper, who hands the money to Bin Saood’s emissaries. 4 . At the same time, enquiries I have made m another direction confirm His Britannic Majesty’s Consul’s statement that the allowances are paid through Sheikh Mubarak in the way indicated but, at the same time, my informant said that there was no regular channel and that the payments were made in whatever manner was most convenient. While I was discussing this matter with Sheikh Mubarak, he suddenly turned to me and said “ You have been asking me about Bin Rashid s and Bin Saood’s pay, but you don’t ask me any question about ^y pay ? 1 said “ Surely, you don’t draw any pay?”. He replied No, 1 do not, but the Turkish authorities at Basrah are for ever pressing me to accept it. Instead of that, I pay them and when they ask me for Turkish £ 200 , I send them 1 . 00 . I told them in reply to their insistence that the receipt of pay from the lurkish Government had ceased to be a source of honour and had, therefore, no longer any attractions for me and that, thanks be to God !

No. i-C., dated Camp, the 13 th October 1906 . From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your endorsement No. 2379 , dated 10 th October 1906 , in which I am honoured by the request for an expression of my views as to the possible combination between the four Chiefs of Mohammerah, Koweit, Riadh and Hail with the view of forming an Arab Confederacy independent of'any Foreign Power and especially of the Porte. 2 . In reply, I have the honour to state that I think such a contingency extremely unlikely, and I am also of the opinion that neither Sheikh Mubarak nor Sheikh Khazal can possibly entertain any illusions as to the durability of such a confederacy. 3 . First and foremost, the peace patched up between Abdul Aziz bin Saood and Meta’ab bin Rashid seems to be a hollow truce which will be broken on the first opportunity, i.e., as soon as ever one of the conflicting parties sees his way to deal a telling blow at the strength and prestige of the other. It is true that Bin Saood would probably make considerable concessions to keep the Turk out of Nejd and El Kassim, but he can have no confidence in either the ability or willingness of Meta’ab bin Rashid to assist him in such an undertaking. The Bin Rashid family, on the other hand, are in such low water just now that they would probably welcome Turkish interference and willingly accept a subordinate position under the Turkish authorities, provided the Bin Saood dynasty was destroyed. Thus the two factions, apart from the jealousy which has now become a second nature to them and the long blood feud account still unsettled, are hopelessly divided on what may be called their foreign policy. 4 Indications have not been wanting to show that the bond that unites the families of As-Saood and As-Subah is a loose one and the Bedouins who live by plunder and lightly transfer their allegiance from one party to the other, as suits their own convenience, will almost certainly cause trouble between the two Chiefs, unless they both show a restraint and moderation utterly foreign to Arab nature. It is, I venture to think, only Bin Saood’s dread ot Turkish encroachment and dominion that has so far kept him wary of offending Sheikh Mubarak. c Nothing serves to unite the interests of As-Subah and Bin Rashid except a regard for the blessings of commerce and the maintenance of o rder - ese considerations are not likely to weigh heavily with either side and least of all with Bin Rashid. 6 . On the other hand, it would seem that Sheikhs Khazal and Mubarak have nothing whatever to quarrel about, while they are both large owners of date gardens both draw a large income from the smuggling of arms and ammumti n, both dislike the interference of the Belgian Customs, and both are anxious to maintain their independence, the one of Persian, and the other of Turkish,^pr A ran helo the other in these questions by advice, information, m^iTuTuo'ans^^mbtiiations raise the price of dates or rifles, etc. These matters Sone wouU be quite sufficient to account for frequent con erences, and I thmk there is no reason to attribute to them the more far-reaching designs sketched out in the Government of India telegram, the impracticability of which the two Chiefs would be the first to realise. No. 52 , dated the 13 th October 1906 . From—W. McDouall, Esq., His Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah, To-MAJOR P. z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to inform you, with reference to your endorsement No. 2380 of October 10 th to copies of telegrams concerning the Sheikhs of Mohammerah, Koweit and Central Arabia, that my views on the subject are practically those expressed in your telegram. I have no information as to the objects of Sheikh Mubarak’s visits except that he appears to be trying to effect a reconciliation with all his old enemies and he can from the Sardar Arfa’s Palace communicate with people at Basrah and elsewhere without attracting attention. Many of the influential sheikhs such as Bin Rashid, Ghazban of the Beni Lam and others occasionally communicate with the Sardar Arfa. As to the Sardar Arfa, from conversations with him, especially when Colonel Meade was here about seven years ago, I am certain that he is fully convinced that he cannot stand alone and, being a Shiah, prefers Persian, if it can last, to Turkish suzerainty. His fear has always been that Persia will break up and then he must find protection against Turkey. He considered the interests of the whole country in the vicinity of the Shatt-el-Arab identical and British negocia- tions with Mubarak raised hopes that protection given to Koweit to the south of the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab would in time lead to protection being given to the north thereof, inhabited by his Arabs. inform No. 54 , dated the 17 th October 1906 . From—W. MCDOUALL, Esq., His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, To—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my No. 52 of 13 th instant, I have the honour you that I have made enquiries as to communication here between Sheikh Mubarak and Central Arabian Chiefs and am told that when he was here a month ago, a representative of Bin Rashid met him on board the “Iran” and Sheikh Khazal was heard to say “ if you three are one I will support you ” or words to that effect. On an Arab of Basrah, Ibn Mendil, coming alongside, Sheikh Khazal signed to Bin Rashid’s man to withdraw. Nothing as to the subject discussed is known. Whatever the subject may have been, I see no reason to alter my opinion as expressed in my letter under reference. Sheikh Khazal, even by those not friendly to him, is acknowledged to be the cleverest Sheikh who has ruled in these parts, and though he cultivates friendly relations with other powerful Sheikhs whenever possible, would not do anything to put himself in a false position with either the Persian or Turkish Government.

I note that His Majesty’s Government adhere to their previous view that our interest must be confined to the coast ; and it goes without saying that no steps will be taken without previous sanction to enter into relations with Nejd or to send agents to the interior ; hut my immediate difficulty is to find a suitable reply to the references made through the local officers by Sheikh Mubarak of Eoweit and Sheikh Jasim of Katar on behalf of Bin Saood ; references which have in no way been courted but which I cannot leave unanswered without incurring among the Chiefs concerned a reputation for personal negligence or discourtesy, which would be prejudicial to my work in other ways.

[Confidential.] No. 500, dated Bahrein, the 17th November 1906. From— Captain F. B. Prtdeaum, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report that on the 10th October 1906 I received a brief note, translation attached, from Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, written with his own hand, requesting me to visit him for a few minutes’ conversation. 2. It was inconvenient for me to go to Lusail within a reasonable time after the receipt of this note; I therefore deputed my Interpreter, Mr. Inamul Hak, to visit Sheikh 'Jasim, instructing him only to receive the old Chief’s message, and not to give any reply in my name. Mr. Inamnl Hak reached Lnsaif on the 23rd October 1906, and left the following day for Doha in the boat by which he had travelled from Bahrein, as he would otherwise have been detained at Lnsail for an indefinite time waiting for a means of return. 3. Shaikh Jasim’s message transpired to be connected with the affairs of Abdul Aziz bin Saood. The latter had requested his friend to communicate with me, because he suspected that the Chief of Koweit had been represen ting his cause to the Government of India in lukewarm manner and it seemed possible that Sheikh Mubarak was afraid of his own importance being over shadowed if Abdul Aziz succeeded in achieving his ends. 4. The resources of Nejd are stated to have been strained to the utmost bv the recent internecine wars, and Bin Saood considers that the oases of Hasa and Katih-were always the most profitable possessions of his TVahhabi ances- torsHeis anxious, therefore, to recover the two districts and he proposes that a secret understanding should be arranged between the British Govern ment and himself, under which he should be granted British protection from Turkish assaults at sea, in the event of bis ever succeeding in dnving he Turks, unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protection the Amir is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to 2919 F DWs^mrt^Tte^eteil^orthis^cre^treaty^h^w^hes'to^be'^ttled or discussed brother representing tim, at soi obtain possession of Hasa and Katif, Saood is df ™.nod o - ^ ^ from theS0 tra ts , he for without the additional ^ menace the highways of com- admits that he is le “ ose „ therefore, in the first place, to apply to merce and f ^‘“Xtasfrrifdik (GoVernorship) of the districts, and to throw off 6 the^Turkis^yo^a^soon as'he considers the'moment favourable after estah- ?lin- himseU If his application is refused, he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready and having captured them, he will appeal openly to the British Government for protection. If he fails, he will never betray the secret under- sfcanding betwcen hi.nself and the Government! Possibly he will not make his attempt, even, for four or five years more. 5. Such is the message, and Sheikh Jasim requests that the reply may he given to him only by word of mouth, when he will arrange to forward it on by trusted messenger. . , , 6 . I presume that the only answer possible is that while the British and Turkish Governments entertain friendly relations towards each other, it is impossible for the Government of India to enter into any such agreement as the Amir desires. I would like, however, to be permitted to add a warning to the Amir, that if he has never yet involved himself in any direct admission of subordination to the Sultan, as I understand he claims not to have done, he should he careful not to commit himself now unless he decides to abide by the consequences. It is generally believed by the Arabs in Bahrein, tnat the Turkish Government, finding that they are unable to collect revenue m the two districts and that the people are favourable towards Bin Saood, are them selves contemplating an invitation to the latter to assume the Government in ^-1-* /-v C5-n'14-n - v» ^ c 7. With regard to Sheikh Jasim’s own health, my Interpreter reports that he appeared considerably stronger than last spring, and that his eyes are so much improved that he is able to attend to all his correspondence himself. He seemed, however, to be downcast in mind, which Mr. Inamul Hak subsequently learnt was due to the faet that he had invested 80 lakhs of rupees in pearls this season at very high rates, and that he had found recently that he was likely to lose heavily in consequence of the subsequent fall in prices.

In continuation of my two letters marginally noted by last mail, in Nos, 2719 and 2738, dated 24 tb November isos, connection with Nejd affairs, I have the n • honour to forward, for the information of e Government of India, a copy of a farther communication which I have since Koweit, No. 46 i, dated 2otb November 1906. received from the Political Agent* ,. , , , ' Koweit, reporting the details of a conver sation which he has had with Sheikh Mubarak. The latter’s remarks in behalf of Bin Saood’s cause, as reported in para graph 5 of Captain Knox’s letter, are a repetition of his former representations, hut his subsequent observations regarding the Baghdad Railway question, are of much^ interest as evidence of the astute concern which he takes in the political situation, and, at the same time, seem to me to bear out the view which I have all along maintained that, in spite of the coquetry with the Turks in which the force of circumstance obliges him periodically to indulge, Sheikh Mubarak has at bottom a genuine conviction that his salvation lies in close adherence to the Christian Power, at present Great Britain, which occupies a predominant position in the northern portion of the Gulf. No. 451, dated the 20 th November 1906. From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I havp the honour to inform you that I have just returned this morning from a visit to Sheikh Mobarak at which he gave me the following news from Nejd.. 2*. He; said that he had received letters from Bin Saood and from Bin Rashid, and that the former had told him that the Mutessarif with 1,200 men (Syrian troops) and 12 guns bad left for Medina on the 15th Ramzan=3rd instant, and that on the first day of Shawal=19th instant, the Amir-ul-Alai (Commandant) with 1,100 Iraq men and 3 guns would return to Iraq. 3. Bin Saood also said that the Turkish authorities were very anxious to leave 200 men in El Kasim, of whom 100 men should remain in Boraida and 100 in Anaiza. To this, however, he and the headmen of El Kasim refused to consent, and eventually it was agreed that small detachments only should remain, viz., 25 men in Boraida and 15 in Anaiza. 4. Bin Saood also said that he holds a paper signed by 80 Turkish Officers to say that they have found Bin Saood a loyal servant of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, who has helped them to all they needed as far as possible ; that Nejd is a poor country with an abominable climate, bad water and no supplies which can support Turkish troops. 5. Sheikh Mubarak ended this lengthy recital with comments on the affairs of A1 Hassa which he said were in a very bad way, and he suggested that it would be an excellent thing if Bin Saood were to take A1 Hassa and Katif, his ancestral property, and that be would then apply for the official protection of His Majesty’s Government. 6 . To this, I replied that I could make on this proposal no comment whatever, but that, as the Sheikh probably was perfectly well aware, all communications that he made to me were promptly passed on to you for transmission to higher authority who would send such instructions as they thought fit and that it was idle for me to speculate as to what views such authority would take.$ as to the that they and that said that 7 T1, P Sheikh then mentioned that a large number of people at Kerbala 7.

Fahad refused to sell the gun, saying that he would send it either to Mubarak or to Bin Saood. The two Chiefs offered me a warm welcome if I came into their country, which begins about three days south ot ikoweit. 11 .

Lord Lansdowne concurs in the telegram which Mr. Brodrick pro poses to address to the Government of India to the effect that no steps are to be taken for sending agents to Nejd, or for entering into closer relations with the tribes, without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government.

With reference to your letter of the 4th ultimo, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansciovvne to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copies of correspondence with Ills Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople on the subject of the proposal of the Government of India to send a Political Agent to enquire into the condition of Nejd. It will he observed that Sir N.

The question might he made the subject of further consideration when more detailed 'information is received as to the methods by which it is proposed that the investigation should be conducted. I transmit to your Excellency herewith copy of a letter from the India Office, forwarding correspondence relative to the condition of affairs in the interior of Turkish Arabia, in which a proposal is made by the Government of India that a European officer should visit Edadh in order to report on the state of the tribes. I also enclose a copy of the reply which I have caused to be returned. Your Excellency will observe that the Government of India have been informed that no steps are to be taken to enter into closer relations with Nejd, or to send agents there, without previous consultation with His Majesty’s Government. It will be within your Excellency’s recollection that, since the date of the Koweit Agreement, proposals have successively been made for the extension of British protection to the territories of the Sheikhs of Koweit and El Katr and of the Amir of Nejd, and that on each occasion His Majesty’s Government have, after full consideration of the circumstances, decided that it would be inexpedient to incur the difficulties and embarrassments involved. In the present instance, though it is no doubt desirable that His Majesty’s Government should be in possession of fuller information with regard to the interior of Arabia, the proposed course of deputing a European officer would, in all probability, lead to further proposals for establishing closer relations with the Saud family, to which there would be objections at least as I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State for India.

Before, however, replying finally to the India Office, I should be glad to be furnished with your Excellency’s observations upon the subject. I am, &amp;c., Lansdowne. The Bight Hon. Sir N. B.

In your Despatch, No. 50 (Confidential), of the 15th instant, your Lordship is good enough to ask my opinion regarding a proposal to send a political agent into the interior of Arabia to report on the condition of the tribes, more especially with regard to the situation of affairs at Biadh and Nejd. I venture to express my concurrence in the objections stated in your Lordship’s above-mentioned Despatch to sending a special emissary to either place, at all events just at a moment when the susceptibilities of the Turkish Government have been excited by the visit of the Viceroy of India to the Arabian Coast, and the hopes of the Arabs, who are well disposed towards llis Majesty’s Government, have been raised to a point which may indirectly encourage them to engage in a movement against the Ottoman rule and authority. At the same time, I feel that it would be no doubt useful to have fuller information than we possess in regard to the position of affairs in the interior, and while thinking the present moment unfavourable, I consider it most important not to lose sight of the proposal. The troubled condition of affairs and the internecine feuds, which threaten at any moment to assume formidable proportions, make it very important that we should understand the exact condition of affairs, and be in a position to make up our minds as to the policy to be followed in case of a serious revolutionary outbreak and the cessation of Ottoman rule in El Hasa.

From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.T.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Foreign Department telegram No. S.—148, dated 13th November 1906, repeating to me the terms of the reply cabled by His Majesty’s Secretary of State to the Government of India’s reference in connection with my letter No. 2181, dated 16th September 1906. 2 . I note that His Majesty’s Government adhere to their previous view that our interest must be confined to the coast ; and it goes without saying that no steps will be taken without previous sanction to enter into relations with Nejd or to send agents to the interior ; but my immediate difficulty is to find a suitable reply to the references made through the local officers by Sheikh Mubarak of Eowe|t and Sheikh Jasim of Katar on behalf of Bin Saood ; references which have in no way been courted but which I cannot leave unanswered without incurring among the Chiefs concerned a reputation for personal negligence or discourtesy, which would be prejudicial to my work in other ways. As it is obviously advisable that the replies vouchsafed to the references Bahrein, No. 500, dated 17th November 1906» previously reported, 9S Well as to the and enclosure. further one just received from Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, which I now enclose, should be authoritative and in terms which would be considered suitable by His Majesty’s*Hovernment, I shall be grateful for the advice of the Government of India as to the precise language which should be used. [Confidential.] No. 500, dated Bahrein, the 17th November 1906. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report that on the 10th October 1906 I received a brief note, translation attached, from Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, written with his own hand, requesting me to visit him for a few minutes’ conversation. 2 . It was inconvenient for me to go to Lusail within a reasonable time after the receipt of this note; I therefore deputed my Interpreter, Mr. Inamul Hak, to visit Sheikh “Jasim, instructing him only to receive the old Chief’s message, and not to give any reply in my name. Mr. Inamul Hak reached Lusaif on the 23rd October 1906, and left the following day for Doha in the boat by which he had travelled from Bahrein, as he would otherwise have been detained at Lusail for an indefinite time waiting for a means of return. 3. Shaikh Jasim’s message transpired to be connected with the affairs of Abdul Aziz bin Saood. The latter had requested his friend to communicate with me, because he suspected that the Chief of Koweit had been represen- tin 0, his cause to the Government of India in lukewarm manner and it seemed possible that Sheikh Mubarak was afraid of his own importance being over shadowed if Abdul Aziz succeeded in achieving his ends. 4. The resources of Nejd are stated to have been strained to the utmost by the recent internecine wars, and Bin Saood considers that the oases of Hasa and Katif were always the most profitable possessions of his Wahhabi ances tors. He is anxious, therefore, to recover the two districts ^nd he proposes that a secret understanding should be arranged between the British Govern ment aSTlumself, under which he should be granted British protection from Turkish assaults at sea, in the event of his ever succeeding in driving the Turks, unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protection the Amir is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to 2919 F D vl -- mtf i r [f&gt; . „ ^ a n Pnlitical Officer to reside at those of the Trucial Chiefs) an ° P j h to be settled or discussed Ins Court.

I wonld like, however, to be permitted to add a warning to iJhe Amir that if he has never yet involved himself in any direct admission of subordination to the Sultan, as I understand he claims not to have done, he i should be careful not to commit himself now unless he decides to abide y the consequences. It is generally believed by the Arabs in Bahrein, tnat the •Turkish Government, finding that they are unable to collect revenue m the two districts and that the people are favourable towards Bin Saood, are them- selves contemplating an invitation to the latter to assume the Government in the Sultan’s name. 7 With regard to Sheikh Jasim’s own health, my Interpreter reports that he appeared considerably stronger than last spring, and that his eyes are so much improved that he is able to attend to all his correspondence himself. He seemed, however, to he downcast in mind, which Mr. Jnamul Hak snbseauently learnt was due to the fact that he had invested 80 lakhs of rupees in pearls this season at very high rates, and that he had found recently that he was likely to lose heavily in consequence of the subsequent fall m prices.

Sami Pasha is reported to have said that he must have four, whereupon the matter was referred by both sides to Constanti nople. The Sultan instructed the Commander of the VI Army Corps at Baghdad to withdraw all troops from Knsim, except two battalions, and in a year’s time to reduce the force to one battalion. Orders were sent about a month ago to Sami Pasha to this effect. It is said that there are nine battalions belonging to the VI Army Corps in Kasim but none are up to full strength. The effective of each battalion is reckoned at about 200 men. It is said that the troops are preparing to evacuate Kasim and that the troops sent from Medina will also be withdrawn. I am also informed that Izzet Pasha received a letter from Sheikh Mubarak a few days ago forwarding BT.200, as the Sheikh had heard the barracks at Basrah were still unfinished. The letter was couched in obsequious terms, and Izzet Pasha was requested to inform the higher authorities of the Sheikh’s further donation. I have, etc., F. E. CROW. No. 15.

The latter’s remarks in behalf of Bin Saood’s cause, as reported in para graph 5 of Captain Knox’s letter, are a repetition of his former representations, but his subsequent observations regarding the Baghdad Railway question, are of much interest as evidence of the astute concern which he takes in the political situation, and, at the same time, seem to me to bear out the view which I have all along maintained that, in spite of the coquetry with the Turks in which the force of circumstance obliges him periodically to indulge, Sheikh Mubarak has at bottom a genuine conviction that his salvation lies in close adherence to the Christian Power, at present Great Britain, which occupies a predominant position in the northern portion of the Gulf. No. 451, dated the 20th November 1906. From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that I have just returned this morning from a visit to Sheikh Mobarak at which he gave me the following news from Nejd. 2. He said that he had received letters from Bin Saood and from Bin Rashid, and that the former had told him that the Mutessarif with 1,200 men (Svrian troops) and 12 guns had left for Medina on the 15th Ramzan Bid instant, and that on the first day of Shawal=19th instant, the Amir-ul-Alai (Commandant) with 1,100 Iraq men and 3 guns would return to Iraq. 3. Bin Saood also said that the Turkish authorities were very anxious to leave 200 men in El Kasim, of whom 100 men should remain in Boraida and 100 in Anaiza. To this, however, he and the headmen of El Kasim rR f us ed to consent, and eventually it was agreed that small detachments only should remain, viz. } 25 men in Boraida and 15 in Anaiza. 4. Bin Saood also said that he holds a paper signed by 80 Turkish Officers to say that they have found Bin Saood a loyal servant of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, who has helped them to all they needed as far as possi e , a Nejd is a poor country with an abominable climate, bad water and no supplies which can support Turkish troops. 5. Sheikh Mubarak ended this lengthy recital with comments on the affairs of A1 Hassa which he said were in a very bad way, ® nd .^ e „ su ff est ^ that it would he an excellent thing if Bin Saood were to take A1 Hassa, and Katif, his ancestral property, and that he would then apply for the official protection of His Majesty’s Government. 6 To this, I replied that I could make on this proposal no comment whatever, but that, as the Sheikh probably was perfectly well aware, a 1 communications that he made to me were promptly passed on to you for transmission to higher authority who would send ^^7“' ews uch thought fit and that it was idle for me to speculate as to what authority would take.7 Tho Sheikh then mentioned that a large number of peop e at Kerbala , . 7 - The Sheikn tnenm M Consul-General at Baghdad for had applied to His B fik ] oou J nt roimd A mara between the two protection, and that the f „ * revolt, and that the railway Vilayets of Baghdad an - prosperous unless it was in British control would nerer reach the sea Mr draw the profit of it from Baghdad to the se , -niavino- with the Porte, and remarked SatlftasX^nd'and^her warships that' had saved Constantinople at the ^s'ittL^rtoW^tlThe had no exact information as to the TnrMsh casnalties, n A1 Hassa, but that the Ajman declared that they M destroyed two troops and taken away their arms, and that j/u Al TTassfi garrison had hoon kill6d, Hg said that undoubtedly Fahad bin Hithlain, the Ajman Chief, now in Koweit, had captured a gun and had brought in two mules and many donkeys for sale m Kdweit and would send in more. , • j i , . 9 Pahad bin Hithlain came to see me on the 19th instant, and wit i him an old* and influential Sheikh of the Ajman, named Salim bin Muhammad of tL Kadi Section. The Chief is a fine handsome young man of abou 30 wears of age. He looked lazy and goodnatured and talked but little, hut he |ave one toe impression that he would be a leader of men, fierce and vindictive, if he were roused to action. 10. These two both exaggerated Sheikh Mubarak’s account of their victory and said that the El Hassa townsmen with the soldiers had now tasted their vengeance and were ready to agree to any terms. y offered to write off all claims for blood-shed and to pay 'te aU - ?! allowances due to the Ajman Sheikhs, and especially sued that they might redeem the gun (offering for it T.£2,000) and to pay double prices for all arms and mules. Fahad refused to sell the gun, saying that he would send it either to Mubarak or to Bin Saood. The two Chiefs offered me a warm welcome if I came into their country, which begins about three days south of Koweit. 11. The Turkish withdrawal from Nejd, coupled with the news from Al Hassa, appears to have had an effect, very unfortunate for 0 ?, ? u VJ opinion in these parts and one might hazard the assertion that Sheikh Muoara knows more than he told me about possible complications in Al Hassa and the Muntafik country.Ccnfidential.

Can P ° SSlb 7 entertain any ilIusions as t0 ^ durability of such „ n . 3 - and foremost, the peace patched up between Abdul Aziz bin Saood and Meta ab bin Rashid seems to be a hollow truce which will be broken on the first opportunity, r.e., as soon as ever one of the conflicting parties sees his way to deal a telling blow at the strength and prestige of the other. It is true that Bin Saood would probably make considerable concessions to keep the Turk out of Nejd and El Kassim but he can have no confidence in either the ability or willingness of Meta ab bin Rashid to assist him in such an undertaking. ^ , T he Bin R ashi d fan &gt;&gt;ly. °n the other hand, are in such low water just now that they would probably welcome Turkish interference and willingly accept a subordinate position under the Turkish authorities, proyided the Bin Saood dynasty was destroyed. Thus the two factions, apart from the jealousy which has now become a second nature to them and the long blood feud account still unsettledi are hopelessly divided on what may be called their foreign policy. 4. Indications have not been wanting to show that the bond that unites the families of As'Saood and As - Subah is a loose one and the Bedouins who live by plunder and lightly transfer their allegiance from one party to the other, as suits their own convenience, will almost certainly cause trouble between the two Chiefs, x unless they both show a restraint and moderation utterly foreign to Arab nature.’ It is, I venture to think, only Bin Saood’s dread of Turkish encroachment and dominion that has so far kept him wary of offending Sheikh Mubarak. 5. Nothing serves to unite the interests of As-Subah and Bin Rashid except a regard for the blessings of commerce and the maintenance of order. These considerations are not likely to weigh heavily with either side and least of all with Bin Rashid. 6. On the other hand, it would seem that Sheikhs Khazal and Mubarak have nothing whatever to quarrel about, while they are both large owners of date gardens, both draw a large income from the smuggling of arms and ammunition, both dislike the interference of the Belgian Customs, and both are anxious to maintain their independence, the one of Persian, and the other of Turkish,4 dominion.

I have the honour to inform you, with reference to your endorsement No. 2^80 of October 10th to copies of: telegrams concerning the Sheikhs of Mohammerah, Koweit and Central Arabia, that, my views on the subject are practically those expressed in your telegram. I have no information as to the object? of Sheikh, Mubarak’s visits, except that he appears to be trying to effect a reconciliation with all his old enemies, and he can from the Sardar Arfa’s Palace communicate with people at Basrah and elsewhere without attracting attention. Many of the influential Sheikhs such as Bin Rashid, Ghazban of the s Beni Lam and others occasionally communicate with the Sardar Arfa. As to the Sardar Arfa, from conversations with him, especially when Colonel Meade was here about-seven .years ago, I am certain that he i$ fully convinced that he cannot stand alone and, being a Shiah, prefers Persian, if it can last, to Turkish suzerainty. His fear has always been that Persia will break up and then he must find protection against Turkey. He considered the interests of the whole country in the vicinity of the Shatt-el-Arab identical and British negocia- tions with Mubarak raised hopes that protection given to Koweit to the south of the mouth of the Shattfel-Arab would in time lead 5 to protection being given to the north thereof, inhabited by his Arabs, Np.^, dated the 17th October 1906, From—W.

I have, &amp;e. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum of Information obtained by Mr. Gaskin. (Confidential.) AVTIH reference to the Turkish occupation,* he informed me that there were °nly about fifty Turkish soldiers under a Kulaghasy at Boreida, and a similar detachment at Aneza, and the main body, consisting of over 1,000 infantry, a few cavalry with four heavy field guns and five or six lighter pieces, stationed at Sheihiya, a village about five or six hours’ ride west-north-west of Boreida, under the command of Sami Pasha. The Turks are there on sufferance, and do not interfere in any way with the local affairs, and confine themselves to their quarters, only leaving them when goin to purchase food or going to the mosque for prayers. The troops are rationed by their own Government—the Amir does not provide them with anything. They are wretchedly off; many of the officers and men are continually deserting. If no fresh troops are sent to relieve the present garrison before long, no soldiers will be left in Kassim through the wastage by disease and desertions. As regards the young Amir, he stated that the people of Jabal Shammar are very hopeful of him, and he has gained their affection through his straightforwardness, generosity, and habit of carrying out no undertaking without consulting all the Elders of the Al-Rasehid clan and listening to the best advice. He has remitted the tribal taxes for the current year, and reinstituted the payment of annual allowances to the various tribal Chiefs, retainers, and charities on the same scale as that paid by his grandfather. These allowances had been reduced by his father. After reducing to obedience the Heteim and Shararat tribes occupying the tract of country lying between Teima and Jowf, the Amir, on about the last week of August 1906, attacked the Mateir Arabs, adherents of Bin Sa’ad, in Kassim, and carried aw r ay much plunder in the shape of camels, horses, cattle, and sheep. Regarding the general feeling of the Arabs towards the Turks, my informant declared that there is a growing discontent and dislike tow r ards them because ot their unjust demands and harsh treatment; the life of the Arabs is becoming harder every year, and poverty is overshadowing them. Many of the Arab Chiefs, whose incomes amount to 400 or 500 lires—which w r ould be sufficien! under ordinary conditions for their needs—are reduced to beggary on account of the exactions of the Turkish officials. The Arabs are longing to throw off the Turks and become independent, or to come under the protection of the Great Powers, as in the case ol Bulgaria and Roumelia.f AVith this view, recently a Hitein Chief, whose brother is imprisoned by * See note by Major Ramsay, f This has not been paraphrased, but is what the Arab said [2223 e—l]'1 &gt;WJaBMT9Hn t / , i . i „/i fimno-h thp rimount of bribes demanded by the officials the Turks and not yet released ihough the ‘ m ° un ^ fik Arabs the formation of a has been paid has 1 njosed t to the M,e^h of^Munt ^ the Turiis Qiit o , strong eonfedeiacj b t, ntl t o the Great Powers for protection. The Mautafi, Sheihh d*id not fall in with the views of the Hitein Sheikh, as the Arabs consider the Hiteta are of inferior blood, and a proposal coming from such a source would not V, take V’ P i , nfo™ant A Tlso informed me that cereals were very expensive in Jahal qivmmL and Kassim and prices ranged five or six times as high as those on the Euphrates owing to the limited produce available in the regions mentioned He explained that the fields are irrigated by water drawn from wells by camels, and these animals cannot stand the work, and in two months they become useless and are sold “fifth of their original price, and though there is plenty of water and arable land, for tills reason they find it just as cheap to import their gram from the districts on the Euphrates. He has heard of the recent importations of pumps into Bagdad for purposes of irrigation, and he is very much interested m the matter as he thinks that these appliances would meet with much favour m the regions indicated, as the whole of the cultivable land may he brought under cultivation by then employment. He understands that the price of Russian kerosene oil necessary for working the oil engine which drives the pump is about 20 per cent, dearer m Jabal Sliammar than at Koweit from where it will have to be procured, and that proper mechanics will have to be engaged to work the engines, &amp;e., from Bagdad at a higher rate of pay than thev receive locally. He wishes to procure definite information as regards a pumping plant capable of raising a similar quantity of water as ten or eleven “ bakras’’* from a depth of 8 to 9 metres. When the details are forthcoming, be proposes to transmit them to the Amir of Jabal JShammar, and suggest to him the purchase of such a puinpin f f plant for erection at Hayil as a trial. If the venture meets with success, lie declares that over 200 plants will he required m the localities mentioned alone. He asked me whether I would assist him in obtaining the details of a suitable plant— a plant that can he carried in pieces, weighing from 2 cwt. to 2-J cwt. each, for transport by camel. In respect of the appearance of several sections of the Aneza tribe of Arabs on the Euphrates between Musayib and Nedjef, he stated that it was nothing unusual. He explained that it was customary for these Arabs to camp in that neighbourhood during this season of the year so long as the grazing ground roundabout supported their camels, cattle, and flocks. About fifteen years ago the Aneza fell out with the Amir of Jahal Sliammar, and to avoid being raided by the Amir they kept aloof from the lower reaches of the Euphrates, hut now that they have come to an understanding with the Amir, they need no longer take that precaution. There are several thousands of tents scattered in groups of 200 to 500 throughout the region mentioned. (Signed) J. C. GASKIN. September 24, 1906. Note by Major Ramsay.

With reference to my despatch No. 59 of August 25th, I have the honour to report that I called on Lieutenant-General Sudqi Pasha last Wednesday. He had been ordered to Baghdad and left the same evening. It is uncertain whether he will return to take up his appointment as Commandant at Basrah. Sudqi Pasha stated that he had handed over the Command in El Kasim to Sami Pasha, Acting Mutessarif and Commandant and stayed ten days with him after his arrival. Sami Pasha brought 500 soldiers and one gun with him from Medina. The troops arrived in excellent condition. According to Sudqi Pasha’s account there are 2,500 troops in Nejd and El Kasim. The lines of communications are open and caravans arrive freely and, though supplies are not easily obtainable locally, all necessaries were for warded to them by caravans. Information from other sources does not confirm this favourable account. The tale told by the numerous deserters who have from time to time found their way to Koweit and thence the Basrah during Sudqi Pasha s command in Kasim is a very different one. They describe the state of the troops there as pitiable in the extreme and state that provisions are scarce and they are with out pay. Sudqi Pasha himself is said to be owed 2,000 Turkish £ for his services. Sudqi Pasha said that Ibn Saood was jealous of Saleh bin Mohanna’s intercourse with the Turkish Officers and that he got the people of Boreyda to sign a mazbata complaining of his oppression and then removed him to Riadh He ^tributes his removal to personal animosity. Though Mohanna was appointed Kaimakam of Boreyda by the Mushir, the appointment had not bee confirmed by Constantinople. Sudqi Pasha marched from Boreyda to, Ziffi and thence travelled by way f Es Safa -d Suba k e t 0 Kowe, crossing tne northern end of ^he Dahna “rr, ml 1.4'. plrimei on cam*. ... *1 ,; h ,j nn casualties. He seems to have travelled very quickly. He told me’that peace had been established between Ibn Saood and Ibn Rashid ut 7a . .if-1 11- would last very Ion?. He described Ibn Saood as a desert did not think Aun 1 A-717 Rin°Rashid as a desert warrior and said the the present, u s rence 0 f hostilities between the rival factions at no°ffista P nt date. He stated the Arabs had now all retired to their homes and their pastures.The murder of Abdul Aziz bin Jilwa, while on his way to Koweit with letters from Ibn Saood, was, I am informed, perpetrated by a raiding party o Shamar Arabs who had not heard the news of peace being proclaimed. 1 learn that the allowance granted by the Turkish Government to Ibn Saood is by recent arrangement paid through the Sheikh of Koweit who deducts it from the land tax due to the Government on his Fao property. Metaab s allowance is supposed to be paid through Baghdad, but I have not heard of his receiving anything as yet. I can obtain no confirmation of the report from Jeddah, mentioned in Your Excellency's despatch of 7th July, that Ibn Saood had ordered the Arab Sheikhs and tribes in Nejd to abstain from communication with Turkish officers and troops and to stop carrying their mails and supplies. Sudqi Pasha seems to have been on very friendly terms with Ibn Saood who visited him several times during his recent visit to Boreyda and brought his retainers and many Arab Sheikhs with him. The troops have no doubt suffered from want of money and though there was little or no fighting they must necessarily have endured great hardships.

Subsequently when touring on the Arab Coast in May last I had an opportunity of meeting Sheikh Jasim bin Thani at his summer quarters at Lusail, and on that occasion he expressed himself to much the same effect on behalf of Bin Saood, saying that the latter was now strong enough to drive the Turks out of Nejd and A1 Hassa and asking whether in the event of his coming down j to the coast, the British Government could not see their way to give him the I same measure of protection by sea as they gave to Sheikh Mubarak and other Arab Chiefs on the Coast, in pursuance of their traditional policy of preserving the maritime peace of the Gulf. He added that it would be a simple matter for Bin Saood to meet a British officer at the coast, if that course were considered desirable. In reply, I told Sheikh Jasim that this was a question to which I could not give him any definite answ r er offhand and without instructions from the Govern ment of India. just at that time the news of the death of Bin Rashid at the hands of his rival reached the coast and the situation seemed so kaleidoscopic that I delayed making any report to Government until matters had crystallised somewhat. I have now received from Captain Knox a communication from Sheikh. Mubarak to much the same effect as the foregoing. We have thus been approached from t hree directio ns and I think there ean be no doubt that these representations may be held to have been inspired by Bin Saood personally. 3. Bin Rashid’s death at the hands of his rival had an important influence on the situation, and as the Government of India have been informed, the three cornered peac e of which the possibility was indicated in paragraph 2 of my letter No. 620 of 18th March has lately taken shape. Whether it will endure on its own merits or whether the Turks will at once ggf- themselves to undo it, it is impossible to prophesy, but seeing that the present Bin Rashid is a mere youth of 18, it is hardly likely that he will be able to make any serious stand against Bin Saood for some time to come. The juncture is consequently a convenient one for an examination and review of the political situation in Central Arabia and of our attitude towards Bin Saood and 1 venture to hope that Government will take advantage of it for that purpose. 4 . While I believe I am right in thinking that regard with * (1) Foreign Department telegram No. 1748- E A., dated 19th May 1904. (2) Foreign Department letter No. 3397-E.B., dated 8th October 1904. His Majesty’s Government no favour the idea of the Turks establishing themselves in Nejd,* I am at the same time aware that it has been a recognised principle of their policy not to allow themselves to become involved in the tempestuous politics of Central Arabia. Nevertheless it must be conceded that we have principles and interests to consider other than the pursuit of the purely negative doctrine of aloofness above mentioned, and I cannot see that these are in any way served by our carrying that doctrine to an extreme point and by our treating the predomi nant Arab element in Nejd with an active neglect which not only places us in an / 2-funnecessarily unfavourable position for safeguarding the other interests referred to but which, ^persevered in, may be mistaken for hostility on our part and may engender a reciprocation of that sentiment on the p-irt of the Wahabi Chief. 5. Thus it will be remembered that Bin Saood formally appealed to us for telegram Resident to Foreign Department, protection in 3 letter tO me, dated 2nd dated 16th May 1904. May 1904, but no reply on behalf of Gov- ernment to that communication was ever authorised, and at the present time no practical modus vivendi between the Arab and ourselves can be said to' exist. The inconvenience of this became apparent in connection with the intention attributed to Bin Saood of visiting Oman, which has created so much apprehen sion in the minds of the Pirate Coast Chiefs during the past year; Had they known that any sort of friendly understanding existed between the Residency or Government and Bin Saood, both the Sultan of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs would have been fortified with the consequent knowledge that any attempt om the part of the Wahabi to make a descent upon Oman would involve a prelimi nary rupture with us. In the absence of any such entente all we could do was to get Sheikh Mubarak to*give him a hint that any such action on his part would be regarded wirh disfavour by us. It is true that it appeared afterwards that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople had expressed the opinion correspondence-received wilh Foreign De* that WC should deal With Bin Saood direCtj- pa-tment endor-emeat No, 2020-E.B., dated tytb but meanwhile it had become necessary to May *’ - take action locally in the most expeditious way open to us„ As a matter of fact this course met with a very courteous res- Resider I to Foreign Department No. 273, dated ponse from Bin Saood 33 reported tQ- Gov- 5 th Apni j£o(5.. ernment at the time. 6. Another matter in regard to which we lose by not being on any sort of terms with the Wahabi is the question of piracy in the northern part of the Gulf., There is good reason to suppose that, had we friendly relations with him, Bin? Saood would be able to give us considerable assistance in running down noto rieties like the outlaw Ahmed bin Salman, who yearly commits more or less serious depredations during the pearling season. 7. At the present epoch, as before mentioned, peace reigns in the land, and if we have any intention of establishing some measure of friendly intercourse with the Ruler of Nejd, the present seems to be the time for us to do so. If on, the other hand we persevere in our policy of ignoring him altogether and leaving his appeals unanswered and if we allow the Turks to revive the strife in Central Arabia which theoretically they have now no excuse for doing, it will be small; matter for wonder if we make him our bitter enemy for the future. I hesitate to make premature suggestions as to the* terms which might figure m any agreement made, as I am aware that the problem is a delicate one and requires examination by a lens of longer focus than 1 can command, but I think I may say without temerity that I should welcome any degree of friendly understanding which would facilitate my dealings with the Trucial Chiefs and: which would render it possible and unobjectionable for our officers to make occa sional tours- in the country and thereby to acquire accurate information regarding ' **« •mmrn, 10 l he Mowing i,e„,oi pne- (i) The latter part of letter No.. 6c* dated March ,904, from the Government of India to the Secretary of State.

One of the arguments he used was that, with Nejd in security and Bin Saood under British protection, a caravan would start daily from Koweit for the interior and all its loads would be of Indian merchandise. He also said that Nejd contained with the tribes upward of three millions of men. 3. It is clear that Bin Saood and probably Mubarak himself are uneasy about the late activity of the Turks in El Kasim. Sheikh Mubarak declares now that the Turkish soldiers in Nejd are still 3,000 men. 4 . In reply, I said to Sheikh Mubarak that he might rest assured that l vould report this conversation to you.-•/87 TIIBOBAM. P.

India Office, 22nd February 1906. With reference to my letter of the 29th April 1904 as to the affairs of Nejd, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to enclose, to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a further Secret Letter* from the Government of India on the sub ject of a visit which the Wahabi Amir Abdul Aziz bin Saood is reported to be intending to make to the Pirate Coast and Muscat in the coming spring. It will be observed that, on the 5th December 1905, the Government of India authorised enquiries being made of the Sheikh of Koweit as to Bin Saood’s intentions, but that the result has not yet been reported. In the meanwhile the Government of India, in view of the serious consequences which would ensue if Bin Saood should succeed in establishing his ascendency over the Trucial Chiefs or the Sultan of Muscat, suggest that he should be approached either through the Sheikh of Koweit or the Sultan of Muscat or other suitable channel, with a view to ascertaining whether he is prepared to stand by the Declarationj* of his predecessor not to oppose or t See Declaration of the Wahabi Amir, i n j ure British subjects residing in his territories, and not to interfere with the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government. In regard to this I am to observe that the declaration made in 1866 was not proposed, or even formally accepted, by the British Government, and it contained a leteience to the claim of the Wahabis upon the customs of Muscat. The Govern ment of India further suggest that, in the event of Bin Saood s failing to give the necessary assurance, he should be warned that any attempt on his part to interfere in Oman or on the Pirate Coast would be regarded as an unfriendlv act, and that suitable measures would be taken to°frustrate it. These measures in the opinion of the Government of India might consist either of a more stringent embargo on the import of arms at Koweit and elsewhere, or, in the case of necessity, of actual armed assistance from British ships to the Sheikhs threatened. The serious consequences which might arise from the re-estabhs - ment by Bin Saood of the Wahabi dynasty throughout the centre ot Arabia were referred to in the Despatch from His Majesty s Amoassad or at Constantinople of the 10 th May 1904, No. feea further complicated if, as appears to he the case, Bin Saood l as been recoomised by the Turkish Government and has acknowled^td t suzerainty oAhe Sultan. It will be observed that the Governrcen of India consider that it would be useless and uudesirable to brim, pressure to bear on Bin Saood through the Turkish authorities. p So far as Muscat is concerned I am to observe hat the E cnch Government is conjointly with the British overnme Wahabis independence, and, in the event of interference ^^“^fof India the Trucial Chiefs the measures proposed by ‘‘f ‘ , 1 al)le might not he effective. For instance, sue i con i - . . arms to exercise over the importation of arms into Arabia s l^d to arm imported by British subjects. The questions raised by the Governme S. 10. A 2of India are Urns complicated, and m view of our desire to any entanglements with the rulers of^e ] d,lt seems desirable to take no Steps, in the absence of any urgent necessity caused by Wahabi action until His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople has been consulted on the proposal to approach Bin Sacod otherwise than through the Turkish authorities. t*- The snff^estion of the Governnient of India that, m the es^ent ot I3in Saood’s failing to give satisfactory assurances, a more stringent embargo should be placed upon the traffic in arms, appears to raise a further difficulty by conveying the implication that m the contrary event the Government of India would be prepared to acquiesce in the import of arms bv the sheikh ot Ivoweit. * See Sir T.

As regards Moubarek, it seems fairly certain that, in view of the more friendly relations which have recently been established between him and the local Turkish Authorities of Basra, the Porte would at once get news of our communication to Abdul Aziz, and would in all probability take steps to neutralize its effect. I would therefore suggest, for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government, that our warning would be more effective if it could be arranged that a vessel of war should meet Abdul Aziz at one of the places along the coast which he proposes to visit, and he were given clearly to understand that no tampering with the engagements and Conventions of the Irucial Chiefs will be allowed.

At the same time I see no objection to the issue of the admonition recommended in paragraph 5 of my last communication above quoted. J 3. In regard to Sheikh Mubarak’s attitude, it seems possible that his temporary disapproval of Ibn Saood is due to the fact that while his own relations with the Turks are getting more friendly, Ibn Saood’s are becoming decidedly strained, and this means no doubt that the latter is less inclined than before to be guided by the Sheikh of Koweit’s advice in his relations with the Porte.

I He again assured me that he had every hope that the visit would not come off and that Ibn Saood’s only object was money, 2. This uncalled for return to the subject suggests to me that Sheikh Mubarak has strong objections to Ibn Saood being served by any port but Koweit and that we may reckon on Sheikh Mubarak’s support in this matter.[Confidential.^ No. 64, dated Bushre, the 23rd February (received 6th March) 1906.

B., dated 30th January 1906, I have the honour to furnish the following information hearing on the situation in Nejd. a \ S 11 !, ^ ant ’ 1 received a communication from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the effect that an emissary of Ibn Saood named Musaad bin Suweilim had arrived at Bahrein via El Bida and had called at the Ao&gt;encv He informed Captain Pndeaux that Ibn Saood felt himself strong enough to turn the Turks out of Has sa and Katif and then wished to enter into treatv relations with us, allowing us if we desired to keep a Political Officer in Hassa or Katif m return for our protecting him from a sea attack from the Turks. ' Captain Prideaux expressed his personal doubts as to whether Ibn Saood was strong enough to free himself from the Turks, and otherwise refrained from giving any encouiagement to Musaad s suggestions, and the old gentleman left the Agency in a somewhat disappointed mood saying that he intended to proceed to Bushire by the next mail for medical treatment. 3. On the same date three Nejdi Arabs arrived in Bushire and I had their movements watched as reported in item No. 180 of this Office Political Diary for the week ending 18th February 1906. They proved to be Musaad bin Suweilim and two companions. They stayed with Najaf bin Ghalib, the Koweiti merchant living in Bushire, and on the 18th instant they sent a ’lono- and expensive telegram to His Majesty the Sultan in Romanized Arabic of which I attach a translation. It will be seen that it actually purports to come from Sheikh Jasim bin Thani but was evidently sent on behalf of, and in communi cation with, Ibn Saood. With reference to the first-named veteran, it is interesting to note that at the end of the telegram, as transliterated for delivery to the telegraph office, he describes himself ; “Kayem Mekam Kaze Katr ve reiese ashayeraha ve kebayelleha al abdusadek Jassim al Sani.” I am doubtful whether this is intended to mean; “ Kaim Mukam of the Kaza of Katr and Chief of its clans and tribes, the faithful slave Jassim al Thani” or; “ Kaim Mukam and Kazi of Katr and Chief of its clans and tribes, the faithful slave Jassim al Thani’’ Whichever it be, Sheikh Jassim poses as the humble slave of His Majesty the Sultan, whereas in a letter to the Political Agent, Bahrein, which must have been written about the same time as the above telegram, he rather went out of his way to mention the fact that he considered himself subject to Sheikh Esa of Bahrein. 4. The position seems to be that Ibn Saood is exasperated by the neglect of the Turks to suppress Ibn Rashid, and that he (Ibn Saood) and Sheikh Jassim, whose sympathies are with him, are sitting on the hedge at present and apparently sent this representative, Musaad bin Sweilim, with instructions to sound the British representative in the first place, and, if he received no encouragement from the latter, to proceed$to Bushire and send the above telegram to the Sultan. My informant tells me that the Arabs expected to receive their reply via Basrah and it was therefore no use their remaining here longer.

At the same time the question of the spread of Wahabi influence is one with regard to which we need to maintain a very vigilant attitude, and I should have addressed Government on the subject on my recent return from Beraimi had I not found the Foreign Department letter under reply, awaitin^ me at Bushire. ° 3. The Sheikh of Abu Thabi at a confidential interview which he asked me to give him on the Lawrence spoke to me very strongly on this question. The Government of India will have learnt from paragraph 2 of Captain No. 513 , dated 29 th October 1905. Treyor’a previous communication that , ,. a , . . Sheikh Zaeed was sufficiently disturbed by hm Saood s missive to proceed to Maskat and discuss the situation with the Sultan, and I found him still much exercised at heart. • i 8 n °^ sur P r ^ s m§ being, as he is, the leader of the Hinawi element m Northern Oman (as the Sultan of Maskat is further south), and having been himself^ instrumental in the final extinction of Wahabee influence from ^ e ^ip 3 ^^--^g jirat e Coast jLQL 1870, Sheikh Zaeed, and his kinsman the Sheikh of Debai, shouhTregard the contingency of the appearance of bin Saood with much anxiety. 4. Nor is there, on the other hand, much cause for wonder if, as is the ease, the Ghafiri Section of the Trucial Chiefs, that is to say, all except Ahu Thahi and Debai, should regard bin Saood’s overtures with favour, if not with pleasurable excitement. An indirect result of them has been that Shargah and Hamriyeh, and Shargah and Umm-el-Kowein, who have respectively for a long time been on strained terms, have lately made the support of the Beni Katab Bedouins in a quarrel with Sheikh Zaeed on the Beraimi side, an occasion for reconciliation among themselves, as Ghafiris, for united resistance to Sheikh Zaeed, whom, as the most powerful Chief on the Coast and as a Hinawi, they regard with jealousy and distrust. I did my best to impress upon Sheikh Zaeed the folly of inducin g a com bination of the other Sheikhs against himself by proceeding to extremities with the Beni Katab, and I am glad to hope from the B.esidency Agent's recent reports that he has found a pacific solution of his quarrel with them ; so that any cause for actual unrest is for the present removed; I think, however, that I have said enough to show that the progress of bin Saood’s fortunes will be keenly watched on the Pirate Coast by all parties. 5. Sheikh Zaeed was very anxious that the Government of India should take steps to prevent any movement of bin Saood towards the Pirate Coast, and ^ that imperative orders should he issued to the Ghafiri Sheikhs not to intrigue with him. Beyond the sign which we have already made through Sheikh Mobarek, as now reported, there seems little else that we can do at present, but if the Govern ment of India approve, I see no objection to my giving all the Trucial Sheikhs, both Ghafiri and Hinawi, to understand that on the grounds that general unrest prejudicial to our commercial interests on the Coast would inevitably result,the Government of India would not view with complacency the intrigues of any of them with bin Saood. # . Thp PTktine' impression on the Trucial Coast undoubtedly is that as long as bin Saood estricts his movements to the land the British Government wdlas heretofore refrain from interfering in any way; but the political situation has been so much modified in the last 35 years, that I can hardly think that m regard to the present problem a strict adherence to tradition would be a safe policy for us to pursue. t I beg to be favoured with the views and instructions of Government as earlv as may be possible. .

I have the honour to forward a copy of a communication from the Govern ment of India, regarding the reported No 4441 -E. B., dated 5th December 1905. ambition of bin Saood to visit the Pirate Coast and Oman. This was one of the matters which I had hoped to discuss with you personally at Busrah last week, but as you know, I was prevented from proceeding there at the last minute. 2. The position is briefly this:— Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman has shown by letters which be has addressed to some of the Trucial Chiefs that he has some idea of attempting to re-establish the old Wahabee influence which his forefathers formerly acquired in Oman and of paying a preliminary visit to the Pirate Coast in connection with that aspiration. His interference in the affairs of the Trucial Chiefs or with subjects of the Sultan of Maskat would obviously be a most undesirable contingency; and the Government of India consider that our best means of preventing it is through the medium of Sheikh Mubarak. Hence their desire that you should sound him on the subject. In order that it may not appear that we attach very great importance to the reports at present existing, it would be better that you should in the first instance discuss the matter with Sheikh Mubarak, not as if you were acting on the instructions from Government, but as if on a casual reference from me. You might tell him, as is the case, that during a tour on the Trueial Coast from which I have just returned, I heard from some of the Sheikhs that Abdul Aziz bin Saood bad been writing to them about a visit which he said that he con templated paying to their country ; and then ask him if he thinks that bin Saood seriously contemplates such a thing. You could go on to say that you cannot suppose that Government would approve of any interference by bin Saood in the affairs of Chiefs in treaty relation with us, and that you would advise Sheikh Mubarak as our friend and that of bin Saood to discourage the latter from the project should bin Saood consult him in the matter. Please report as early as possible the results of your interview. No. 1, dated Camp Jahra, the 19th January 1906. Prom— Captain S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 97,^ dated Bushire, 17th January 1906, on the subject of bin Saood’s pro jected visit to the Pirate Coast and Oman. 2 . This morning, I took the opportunity of discussing the matter with Sheikh Mubarak on the lines indicated at the close of paragraph 2 of your letter quoted above. 3. Sheikh Mubarak informed me that he had heard of bin Saoods plans which he regarded as a mere attempt to extort money from the various coastal chiefs; that he had written already to bin Saood, pointing out to him theimpolicy of a confession, on the part of a ruler, to lack of funds; and farther reminding him that bin Eashid was only scotched not killed; that bin Saood’s power in Nejd was anything but finally established; that he had neither funds nor transport for a policy of aggression in the direction of Oman and that the first fruits of such an attempt would be that Sheikh Mubarak would break off relations with him. 4. The Sheikh, in conclusion, said that he did not suppose that, after this letter, bin Saood would persist in his design, though Sheikh Mubarak would not undertake to answer for the opinions and policy of an ignorant savage. 5. The Sheikh and I were quite alone at this interview and I have done my best to render accurately the substance of his remarks. It would appear that Sheikh Mubarak by no means approves entirely of bin Saood; he com plains that there is a want of system and organisation in El-Eiadh and that bin Saood is not the man to attain to the position of his forefathers. Eecently, the Sheikh has been constantly complaining of the degeneracy of the Arabs and the utter want of security and order outside the limits of his own terri tories, but I have been unable, so far, to learn what recent occurrences have given rise to these complaints.

The Chief of Abu Dhabi expressed the hope that he would receive the protection of the British Government, and the same consideration from myself that he had met with from my predecessor. I told him that I could readily give him a promise as regards the second point, but that without specific instructions,^ I could not pledge Government to any particular course of action, though this would doubtless be what was most appropriate to each occasion as it arose. 3. As the agreement of 22nd December 1880, signed by the Chief of Bahrain, contained no provision against a disposal of territory, I thought it desirable to obtain a document to that effect from him, and thus complete the series for the whole coast. The Sheikh preferred one identical in terms with that signed by the Trucial Chiefs to a declaration in a single article, and it has, therefore, been executed in that form, though the first two clauses are really superfluous in his case. I trust that my action in this respect will meet with approval. I, Zaeed bin Khalifah, Chief of Abu Dhabi, in the presence of Lieutenant- Colonel A. C. Talbot, C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, do hereby solemnly bind myself and agree, on behalf of myself, my heirs and successors, to the following conditions, viz. :— 1st.—That I will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government. 2nd.—That, without the assent of the British Government, I will not consent to the residence within my territory of the agent of any other Government. 3rd.—That I will on no account cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory, save to the British Government.

To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. ' A Port William, the 11th January 1906. Sir, We have the honour to forward, for your information, a copy of the correspondence detailed in the annexed list, regarding a proposed visit of Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdul Rahman-bin-Saood to the Pirate Coast and Oman, and to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Mr. Brodrick’s Secret despatch No. 24, dated the 29th April 1904, on the subject of our relations with the Wahabi dynasty. It will he seen that Abdul-bin-Saood, who has been staying in El Katr, has addressed letters to the Trucial Chiefs, expressing his intention of visiting their territories in the spring; and that the Chief of Abu Dhabi has conferred personally on the subject with the Sultan of Maskat, who is much agitated at the idea that the Amir of Nejd may possibly visit Oman. His Highness considers that, should Abdul Aziz make his appearance anywhere on the shores of Oman, it would be the signal for all the Ghaferi tribes to rise against him. 2. Reports from our local officers in the Persian Gulf seem to point to the recent reassertion by the Wahabi dynasty of its former position in Nejd acquiring a permanent character. The cessation of hostilities in Nejd has left Bin Saud free to expand in other directions; and the visit of Sheikh Zaid of Ahu Dhabi to Maskat shows that the situation is actually the cause of some anxiety to the Trucial Chiefs, of w r hom the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi is the most important. We, therefore, consider it very necessary that a course of action should he concerted at an early date, so that we may be prepared for developments. On being apprised of Ihn Saood’s intention to visit the Pirate Coast and Oman in the . s™ letter No. 4 M 1 B.-B., dated the 6th Deoem- ensuing spring, we directed* Major Cox to ber 1905 . ascertain the facts from Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit. We desire, however, to point out how very serious to our prestige and influence the consequences might be, if Ibn Saood should attack the Pirate Coast Chiefs or the Sultan of Maskat, or succeed in extending his influence over them, and how important it is that we should prev ent, as far as lies in our power, such a contingency, ( specially now that the Wahabi Amir has recognised the suzerainty of the Sultan. , 3. In our Secret despatch No. 69 (External), dated the 24th March ' we contemplated the possibility of having to revive the treaty relations which existed with the Wahabi Amirs, in case Ibn Saood should succeed in establishing and extending his ascendancy. Now that the latter has come into power, and has given out that it is his intention to extend his influence towards Oman and the coast generally, it seems to us desirable to ascertain whether he is prepared tostand by the engagement of his predecessors not tooppose or injure British subjects residing in his territories, and not to interfere with the Arab tribes m alliance with the British Government. His Majesty’s Government will no doubt agree with us that it would be both useless and undesirable to bring pressure to bear on Ibn Saood through the Turkish authorities, since his proceedings at El Hassa and in Nejd, as reported in the recent diaries from the Persian Gulf, indicate that he would not be likely to pay any attention to the remonstrances on their part; while we should be serving Turkish interests by involving ourselves in com plications with the Wahabi Amir. We would therefore suggest that, if His Majesty’s Government see no objection, this enquiry be made from Ibn Saood through Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit or the Sultan of Maskat or other suitable channel, and that he be warned, in the event of his unwillingness to give the necessary assurances or to declare his intentions as affecting British interests in Oman or along the Arab coast, that any attempt on his part to interfere in that locality or with the Chiefs and their subjects would be regarded as an unfriendly act, and that suitable measures would be taken to frustrate it. These might amount, in our opinion, to a more stringent embargo on the import of arms at Koweit and elsewhere on the Arabian coast of the Gulf, or even, in the case of an attack being imminent, to actual armed assistance from British ships to the Sheikhs threatened, as might be necessary. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants. J P.

When he landed at Debai from the mail steamer the Chief of Debai’s fired a salute of 2 guns and hoisted his flag on the Government House, ihis Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab is a merchant and deals in pearls but he is at resident of Darein in the District of Katif, and a Turkish subject. He visits! Bahrein, Katr and Bombay. * to that Mohamed bin Abdu! Wahabis the bearer of presents sent to all the Chiefs of the (Pirate) Coast from Abu Dhabi to Um-el-Kowein, by a Bania named Nakandas Jowerjin residing at Bombay. . ^very Sheikh has been sent a silver tray, weighing 130 miskals and one pmr ot Binoculars and one Brocade Shawl with a letter. I beg to forward here with a copy of one of the letters for your information. 1 Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab arrived at Shargah on the 21st Jamadi-Thani (23rd August 1905). The Chief of SHargah fired a salute of 2 guns and hoisted ms flag on the Government House, and entertainments were given in his honour by the Chief of Shargah and some of the inhabitants of that place. He remained at Shargah for 3 days and handed to the Chief the presents sent with him by Nakandas Bania adding a small bundle containing silk cloth, Abba, (cloak) a watch, etc. He then returned to Debai. On embarking on the boat at his departure for Debai, he distributed Rs. 500 amongst the servants of the Chief of Shargah. The Chief of Ajman had sent 2 dromedaries to Mohamed. He, however, did not accept them and returned them to the Chief sending Rs. 100 as a present at same time from himself to the Chief. The Chiefs of Shargah and Debai had each sent 2 dromedaries to Mohamed Abdul Wahab. He accepted them and despatched them to Bahrein by the mail steamer. Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab tried to bring about a reconciliation between the Chief of Shargah and his uncle Sheikh Salem bin Sultan. The latter, how ever, did not agree that the reconciliation should be effected through him (Mohamed) saying “you are a foreigner and an understanding should be made by one who should (always) be present to see that it is not infringed.” \ have heard that a friendship exists between the Headman of Fujeira and Sheikh Salem bin Sultan and that the former has invited the latter to come to Fujeira as his guest and has prepared for him some presents in the shape of dates, etc., and awaits Sheikh Salem's arrival at Fujeira.It appears that, if no reconciliation is effected between the Chief of Shargah •snrl Salem the latter will join the Headman of Fujeira and Zed el-Helah, the Head of Shehiyeen against the Chief of Shargah and take possession of the villages belonging to the latter in the mountainous districts of Ras-el-Kheima and Shargah. But this fact has not become public as yet. Most of the inhabitants of Shargah and Ras-el-Kheima inwardly desire to be ruled by Sheikh Salim bin Sultan. If the latter attacks Rap-el-Kheima and Shargah even with only 100 men, the towns-people will join him. But Sheikh Salem is an old man and does not like fighting and quarrels and only desires means of subsistence from the Chief of Shargah ; but the Chief does not agree to grant him the same and, I think, that, if the case remains in this state, Sheikh Salem will take some measures to involve the Chief in trouble. ^ Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab gave Sheikh Salem bin Sultan $400 and 20 bags rice as a present. Translation of a letter, dated 15 th Jemadi-ul-Awal 1323 (igth July 1905 ) from Nakandas Jowerjin to the Sheikh. You have of course heard the news of the marriage of (my) son Subbagh. We have sent marriage gifts to some of our friends. As you are one of the most respectable friends of ours, we send you, through Sheikh Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab Pasha a present, viz., a silver tray and a pair of binoculars which \ request you to accept and oblige us.

G.Extract from the Diary of the Persian Gulf Political Residency for the week ending 15th (received 23rd) October 1905. ******* Shargah. 13. 5th October 1905* —A.bdul Aziz Ibn Saood has addressed letters to the Trucial Chiefs in which he announces his visit to El Katr and his having effected reconciliation between the El Murrah, Beni Hajir and Ajman tribes. He also expresses his intention of visiting the Chief’s territories in the spring. He left El Katr and went to the watering place Azarnookeh. 14. Chief of Abu Dhabi is reported to have sent the letter received by him from Ibn Saood to the Sultan of Maskat and he himself proposes to go to Maskat to confer with His Highness on the subject. The Residency Agent, Shargah, has been instructed to keep a careful watch and report future developments. Extract from the Diary of the Persian Gulf Political Residency for the week ending the 22nd October 1905. ******* Shargah. 1. 27th September 1905 .—Sheikh Zaeed-bin-Khalifa, Chief of Abu Dhabi, came to Debai on 23rd September with a view to endeavouring to effect a reconciliation with his wife, who recently left him and went to live at Debai with her father. The latter is Sultan hin Naser Sweidi whom Sheikh Zaeed has been trying to settle at Zoara (a disputed peninsula between Shargah and Ajman). Sheikh Zaeed’s mother was a relative of Sultan bin Naser. 2. The Chiefs of Shargah, Ajman and Um-el-Kowein came to Debai to see Sheikh Zaeed, and matters about which there were disagreements between them, were discussed. Sheikh Zaeed asked the Chief of Um-el-Kowein to refrain from entering into any relations with the Bedouins, assuring him that if he was afraid of them, he would support him, against them. The Chief of Um-el-Kowein, though he inwardly wishes to maintain his relations with the Bedouins, especially the Beni Kutb, has accepted Sheikh Zaeed’s advice. The Chiefs then returned to their territories where they were visited by Sheikh Zaeed later on. ******* ^ ^ 3 * , p * &gt; 7 &lt;'- No. 513, dated Bushire, the 29th October 1905. From— Captain A. P. Trevok, I.A., Assistant Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a translation of a report * which I have received from the Residency Agent at Shargah, together with the en closures.! Erom the latter it will be seen that Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Saood visited Katr during the hot weather and that he proposes to visit the Arab Coast and Oman in the spring. These facts were briefly noted in the Diary of the Persian Gulf Political Residency for the week ending 15th October 1905, and it was stated that the Chief of Abu Dhabi proposed to confer with His Highness the Sultan of Maskat on the subject. 2. I have now heard that Sheikh Zaeed-bin-Kalifah duly visited Maskat and that the Sultan is much agitated at the idea that the Amir of Nejd ma-y possibly visit Oman. His Highness considers that should Abdul Aziz make his appearance anywhere on the shores of Oman, it would be the signal for all the Ghaferi tribes to rise against him. 3. I think it is unlikely that Bin Saood will endeavour to visit the Pirate Coast and Oman, but the appearance of the Wahabi Amir in this quarter would certainly cause trouble, and I think that steps should be taken to prevent his making any such visit, should it appear later that he seriously contemplates doing so. * No. 149, dated 5th October 1905. f (1) Letter dated 22nd August 1905, from Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Saood to the Chief of Debai.

(3) Letter from Amer bin Shaban (undated) to the Chief of Abu Dhabi. \I therefore submit this report with the request that the Government of India will be pleased to favour me with instructions as to what action should be taken, should such a contingency arise. Translation of a letter No. 149, dated 5th October 1905, from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I beg to forward herewith copy of a letter from Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman, °Amir of Nejd, to the Chief of Oebai. He has addressed similar letters to the other Chiefs. Herewith is also enclosed copy of a letter from Khalid-bin-Abdulla-es- Soweidi residing at Katr to the Chief of Abu Dhabi, and of the letter from Amer bin Shaban of JBeni Hajir to the Chief of Abu Dhabi. They all contam reports regarding the aforesaid Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdul Rahman. The Chief of Abu Dhabi has despatched the letter received by him from Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdul Rahman, to His Highness Syed Eysel, Sultan of Maskat, and intends proceeding to Maskat by the mail steamer which is due at Debai from Bussorah on the 6th October 1905. I have learnt from the Chief of Abu Dhabi that he intends to confer with His Highness Syed Eysel, regarding the proceedings of Abdul Aziz, Amir of Nejd, who will probably visit the Arab Coast.

I write to inform you that I came to these parts in consequence of the disagreement which had taken place between the Yam tribe (i.e., Ajman). I visited Kafcr and effected a reconciliation between them and punished the offenders. I proposed to stay there to look into certain affairs, but it became too hot— the heat of this country is well known—and I will, if God please, visit these parts without fail when the spring comes. My object in doing so is to look into certain affairs. I thought it desirable to inform you of this. namad-el-Hareibi will furnish you with further particulars.

He said “ Oh Amer, by God, I will explore the country belonging to my father and grandfather, from Maskat to Jealan.” Oh ! Zaeed, I saw that he turned his eyes (towards you). I asked him whether he had a good intention or a bad one. He said he would act upon God s will. I said “ Zaeed is the Imam of the Arab Coast and has relations with your people at Katif and El Hassa, and this fact is not hidden. ,, He said he would do everything properly. He is a man of high account. As to El Hassa by God, the day he made his entry there, his men took charge of the local administration; and he deprived that place of all its valuables.

Madura, accompanied by his son and Sultan-bin-Dhiyab; His Highness the Sultan, with Sai} id Muhammad-bin-Turki, met him on the steamer. Shargah. 25. It appears that, in spite of the advice of the Chief of Abu Dhabi to the contrary (mdelast week’s Diary entry No. 1), the Chief of Um-el-Kowein took with him Abdulla-bin-Ali and Khalifah-bin-Abdalla, head men of the Beni Kutb, to Ajman, and reconciled them to the Chief of that place. They then came to Shargah and entered into an offensive and defensive alliance, which, it is believed, is aimed at the Chief of Abu Dhabi. , ^ No. 4441-E. B, dated Fort William, the 5th December 1905. From—The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 513, dated the 29th October 1905, requesting to be furnished with instructions as to the attitude you should adopt, should Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdul Rahman-bin-Saood endeavour to visit the Pirate Coast and Oman. 2. The Government of India, while noting your view as to the improbabi lity of the visit taking place, are of opinion that the matter is sufficiently serious to justify immediate action ; and they are inclined to think that tlm best way of exercising pressure on Bin Saood with a view to preventing the visits, might be through the channel of the Sheikh of Kcweit who controls, to a large extent, the supply of arms for Nejd, wb ch must still be a matter of importance to Bin Saood. 3 . The Political Agent at Koweit is, therefore, authorized, unless you /&lt;ee any objection, to make enquiries of Sheikh Mubarak as to the facts. A report should in that case be sent of the results of the interview. 4. Since the present rumour appears to be somewhat indefinite, care should be taken at the present stage not to give too official a character to any commu nication that may be made to Sheikh Mubarak. G.
