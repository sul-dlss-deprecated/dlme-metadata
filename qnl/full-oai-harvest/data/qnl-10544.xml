An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 1-16; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence between ff 17-31, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence related to the French Consulate in Muscat and French interests in the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman generally. Much of the correspondence relates to the Consulate building itself including the period after the French Government closed the Consulate and the building was taken over by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and subsequently rented out to private entities. The file contains a limited amount of correspondence with local officials that is in Arabic (with English translations).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Embassies and consulates</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00035e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00035e#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00035e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
