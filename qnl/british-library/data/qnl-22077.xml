In the absence of the Naib-Rais, the Havildar in charge of the Quarter Guard admitted these gentlemen who met and conversed with the prisoner.

I.C Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain.CONFIDENTIAL. No. C/574 of 1939 cs -c * ^ The Officer Cammanding the ^scat Levy has asked me if I can help him in rather a difficult matter. It appears that a man named Darweesh Omar who was a Naik in the Levy and who was dismissed as he was undoubtedly very seriously involved in a theft of rifles from Bait-el-Falaj(my Intelligence summary No.11 of 1939) has beeh enlisted in the Bahrain Armed Police. I myself examined all the documents in the theft case and J- consider that he was very leniently treated. This individual is writing letters to the men in the Levy reviling Muscat service and suggesting that they leave the Levy and go to Bahrain for service in the Armed Police. I have one of these letters in my possession at the present moment. I am sure that Belgrave can know nothing about the man or what he is doing. I shall be grateful for your assistance to put an end to a practice which is not in the interests of either Bahrain or Muscat. H. Weightman Esq. I.C.S. Political Agent, Bahrain.Political Agency, Bahrain, the 23rd May 1940. From R. I, Hallows, Esquire, I.P., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain To The Political Agent, Bahrain Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith my Report on the Bahrain Police. 2. As will be clear from Part II of this Report, the standard of Police Administration in Bahrain is deplorably low. The most effective way of improving it would of course be to appoint a capable officer from the Indian Police for a period of not less than two years. It was however impos sible for me to make such a recommendation in view of the recent appointment of a member of the Ruling Family as Superintendent of Police. The major portion of the work connected with the introduction of improvement* will pro bably fall on Shaikh Khalifah and although he lacks experie nce I think that he should be capable of undertaking this work. I shall of course be only too pleased to give any assistance that I can. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant Assistant Political Agent, BahrainHvtdihx PART I .

The second deals with the results of my inspection and the third contains proposals for reorganisation. In making this report only peace time requirements have been considered. \ General Accurate figures of the population of the Bahrain Islands are not available as there has been no census, but the total is estimated at about 150,000. Of this number, Manama, the largest town r absorbs some 30,000 and the towns of Muharraq and Hedd, in Muharraq Island, some 15,000 and 5,000* Some 5,000 persons live at the oil camp at Awali. Most of the waalth of the Islands Is concentrated in the towns of Manama and Muharraq and the majority of influential traders, shop keepers, pearl merchants, property owners and others who inhabit these two towns are foreigners. A municipality was established in Manama in 1919 and 8 years later a municipality was also formed in Muharraq. Of the rest of the popula tion (over two-thirds of the total) which consists mostly of cultivators, fishermen, pearl divers and labourers, the majority live in the numerous small villages which lie in the northern half of the Isla nd of Bahrain. The villagers are the aboriginal Shia JS'oo* inhabitants/iSs. C inhabitants of the Island (3a^ffa4n) who appear to have been little affected by the enormous changes which have taken place in the towns - especially since the discovery of oil. Many of these villages are very small consisting of a few families and their inhabitans are the poorest element of the community with a very low standard of living. In the bigger villages there is usually a person of influence who is regarded as the head of the community and though such persons have no definite responsibilities to the Bahrain Government it is said that generally speaking they co-operate and keep the Government informed of all matters of interest. The Bahamas are not true Arabs and practically speaking the only real Arabs in Bahrain are the members of the Baling family and members of mainland tribes who live almost entirely in Muharraq and Hedd on Muharraq Island and in Budeya and a few small villages in the South West of Bahrain Island. Except for patrols by the mounted sections the Police have very little contact with the village population as practically all reported crime takes place in the towns. No village records are maintained by the Police. Brief History . In 1926 there existed in Bahrain a levy corps of Muscat Baluchis under the command of a British Officer, a few municipal 'Police* and a body of Naturs for patrolling the streets at night. The Coramanding Officer of t he levy was assisted by an Indian Officer and Non-Commissioned officers from Punjab/Punjab regiments* A series of incidents led t© the disbanding of this corps and in October 1926 a detachment of a Punjab Regiment was stationed at Bahrain for a short time* It was then decided to recruit a force of ex-Indian Army Punjabi Moslems, which was to be less militar y in character and responsible for the proper preservation of law and order. This force of some 200 men was recruited in India and was commanded by a British Officer as Commandant of Police. The experiment was not a sucess for various reasons and not unnaturally was very unpopular with the people. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government therefore in 1929 began to enlist a force of local men to take the place of the Indians* The transition was completed in 1932 and few of the bet' better Indian non-commissioned officers were retained as instructors. The Police Station established in Manama was moved to a better site and Police posts at Muharraq and Hedd were established* Composition of the Force* The Police Force at present consists of 8 Havildars, 12 Naiks, 28 L/Naiks and 298 men or one policeman for 445 of the population. Its composition is shown in the statement below*The Corflmandant of Police is the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Superintendent of Police Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammad al Khalifah who has recently completed ecu rses of training at the , Bombay Politica Training School at Hasik and with the Bombay Sappers and Miners* The Force at present includes 241 Bahrain Arabs, 23 Bahama, 27 Persians, 7 Baluchis, 5 Indians, 1 Somali and the rest are Sudanese Swahilis Yemenis mainland Arabs and manumitted slar ves • About 80 are not Bahrain subjects* Education* 5 non-commissioned officers are literate in Arabic and 9 semi-literate. Of the men 24 can read a nd write simple Arabic but of these not more than 6 are said to be ca|&gt;able of making reports and maintaining records* Enlistment . Men are enlisted by the Commandant for 4 year periods. The greater portion do not stay on after the completion of this period. There are at present 121 men or 35 % of the total strength of the Force with more than 4 years service. There are no pensions or gratuities but on the completion of a 4 year period men are paid for any leave due to them. Pay and Allowances . The Adviser to the Bahrain Gevemment receives an allowance of fts.200/— per month for acting as Commandant of Police. The Superintendent of Police is paid Hs.300/- in addition to his allowance as a member of the Puling/Haling Family. The following are the rates of pay for non-commissioned officers and men Indians• Senior Havildar Rs.92/- Havildars Bs .40/- Rs o60/— Naiks Bs.35/- Rs.40A* I/Naiks Bs.30/«* Men fts .25/— Increments are occasionally granted at the discretion of the Commandant. Good conduct pay is granted after two years service at Hs.3/- per month for all ranks. Powers of Police . The Bahrain Order in Council of 1913 gave criminal jurisdiction over all British subjects and Foreigners within the territories of His Hi^iness the Buler of Bahrain to the Agency Courts. The Courts of the Bahrain Government have jurisdiction only over Bahrain subjects. The powers of Police so far as British subjects and Foreigners are concerned are limited to those granted in this Bahrain Order in Council and the King*s Regulations made under it and to those contained in the various Indian criminal enactments extended from time to time to Bahrain. These enactments include 1. The Indian Penal Code 2. The Whipping Act 3. The India Evidence Act 4. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act • So much of the Indian Post Offices Act which relates to offences against the Post Office. 56. The Code of Criminal Procedure ?• The Fugitive Offenders Act* The powers of the Police so far as Bahrain subjects are concerned have never been defined and are unlimited* The criminal law applicable to Bahrain subjects is contained in a large number of Proclama tions issued from tome to time by the Bahrain Government and the compiling of a Simple Code of Criminal Law is a great necessity* Efforts are being made to secure the services of a retired Magistrate or Judge who could undertake this work* Naturs * The Police do not patrol at night and the protection of property, the apprehension of suspects and the initial investigations of crime is carried out by Nature or night watchmen* Their strength is as follows :~ Bahrain Island * Manama 56 Budeya 4 Suq al Khamls 2 Sitra 4 Asker 4 Total for Bahrain Island 70 Muharraq Island * Muharraq 46 Aerodrome 6 Um-a-Shaqar 3 Total for Muharraq Island 55 The Naturs of Manama are controlled by an Amir and those of Muharraq by a Head Natur the last three/three Amirs of Muharraq having been removed for misconduct. Six selected Naturs of both Man ama and Muharraq patrol within the areas of the munici palities to see that duties are being properly carried out and to report absentees. Crime occurring during the night is reported to the Amir or Head Natur who makes the initial investigation himself and then sends a written report to the Police. The Amir or Head Natur is responsible for the allocation of duties, the distribution of arms and ammunition, the maintenance of records and the preparation of the pay bill. Naturs are under the control of the Superintendent of Police who deals with appointments and dismissals, and general supervising control is exercised by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. Nature on duty are issued with Mark 1 L.E. rifles (manufactured in 1912) and 10 rounds of ammunition. Crime. The following figures for crime dealt w: by the Police are available for the last 3 years. Offences (Cases sent for trial) 1356 1357 1358 Murder 1 1 1 Culpable Homicide - a* «. Cases involving injury to persons 381 393 86 Offences against property including burglery and theft 214 101 63 Bash and negligent driving and other acts 139 20 63 Other offences 28 21 102 Total 763 536 315Yearly statements for the purpose of the annual report of the Bahrain Government have only shown cases sent for trial and therefore these figures do not give a true idea of the state of crime in Bahrain* It is suggested that in future a more detailed analysis of crime should be given showing the number each type of offence reported and sent for trial, or not investigated; the number which resulted in conviction, acquittal or discharge of the accused, the number of persons convicted, acquitted or discharg ed for each type of offence and in the case of offences against property the value of the property concerned* It is not possible to examine the working of the Police from the figures available* A large number of cases must have gone untraced and some undetected and unreported, but for population of some 150,000 it is clear that serious crime is now remark ably low* Owing to the expansion of the field of employment the number of persons without work is probably small and offences against property have decreased* Crime appears to be fairly evenly distri buted between Bahrain subjects and foreigners, the figures for 1938 showing that out of 591 persons sent for trial 302 were foreigners and 289 Bahrain subjects* Political Disturbances * In recent years political agitation has twice assumed fairly serious proportions* Towards the end of 1934 the relations between the Shia and Sunni communities deteriorated. The impact of modem ideas and influence in Bahrain resulted in discontent amongst the Bahamas and caused their leaders to present sweeping demands to the Bahrain Government* The agitation did not however result in rioting and no important//e @ V 1 important police action was called for* The second occurrence took place towards the end of the year 1938 and was different in character from the first occurrence in that public grievances were virtually absent, though this second movement coincided with a genuine public complaint against the Bahrain Courts* This complaint against the Bahrain Courts gave the opportunity to certain Arab malcontents to turn their attention to the semi- educated youth of Bahrain and to lead them in a violent agitation against the Government and Oil Company* Excited by nationalist feelings, the example of what had taken place in Kuwait and Dubai and external press and broadcast propaganda, the youth movement gathered strength and led to a demonstration in Manama* A number of arrests were made and the demonstration was controlled without having to resort to force*PAST 2 CONTHQL AND OFFICES • Adviserate Office ♦ At present all matters except those of an unimportant and purely routine nature are dealt with at the offices of the Bahrain Government by men who know nothing of police work. Police files contain papers on a wide variety of subjects and are closed yearly. All correspondence connected with the Police is not kept in these files and thus correspondence with the Agency on matters concerning the Police is kept with the records of correspondence with the Agency. On the Police files there are papers regarding clothing, equipment, ammunition, there are standing orders, promotion orders, contingent bills, statements of imprest account etc., etc. To ascertain the existing position in any particular branch of the Police administration is difficult and tedious as correspondence may be amongst a number of files which have nothing to do with Police work. F© clear definition has been laid down of the duties, powers and reponsibilities of the Superintendent of Police and this has resulted in some confusion. For instance the Superintendent of Police considered that mattersof pay and accounts were the responsibility of the Adviserate office. The result has been that neither the Superintendent of Police nor the Commandant has checked the pay bill which at any rate for the past six months has been unsigned. There are no records of promotion except the bare orders. There are no records of crime. There are no individual records of men on the lines of a character roll or service sheet. There is no order book in which orders issued by the Commandant are/I w are eirtered and numbered and dated for reference purposes* There are no schemes for' Police action either in the even^of internal disturbances or for Muharram processions or to deal with the remote possibility of an external attack* No record exists of any inspection of the lines or Police station. No records of leave are kept in this office* Police accounts are dealt with by the Accounts Officer who maintains a general cash register for all branches of the Bahrain Government. The Police have a single column in this register in which all payments are entered and the total expendi ture shown at the end of each month. There is no register showing expenditure under the separate heads of the budget estimates. In 1357 estimations were made under the heads State Police, Naturs, jails and in 1358 this was expanded to show State Police Naturs, Jails, Equipment, Uniforms and General Contingencies. The absence of any ledger containing these heads from which expenditure can be watched from month to month removes a great deal of the value of framing budget estimates in this way. Pay bills of the Police are made out by the Lines Clerk and are brought to the Accounts Officer for checking. A summary of the pay bill is then prepared for the sanction of the Commandant. None of the pay bills for the last six months have been signed either by the Commandant, Superintendent of Police, or Accounts Officer. The correctness of the pay bill is considered the responsibility of the Accounts Officer but so far as I can see he possesses id means whatever of checking the bill.He possesses no authoritative information regarding promotions, reductions, dismissals, appointments and obtains all this/ . * nmmi JSmmMthis from the Lines Clerk. An example of the Accounts Officer's inability to check the bill is the fact that no one could explain why the number of pays drawn in Dul Haj 1358 was 6 more than the number drawn in Bui Qaad. I was informed that no appoint ments had been made over this period and certainly no record of any appointments was available, m addition many entries in the bill were in pencil and many had altered, the names of men who had been been/discharged were still shown, payments to the Lines Dhobi and barbers were not entered although their thumb impressions had been taken, and receipts of deductions made for pearling debts, issues of clothing, fines etc., were in many cases missing. Under such a system it is clear the door is wide open for every sort of malpractice and I should be surprised if the opportunity has not been made use of. Contingent bills are also often unsigned but are not passed fcr payment by the Accounts Officer unless supported by vouchers. For some reason the bill is filed with the General Police Files and the vouchers detached and filed separately. Pay is disbursed by the Accounts Officer and I was present at the disbursement for the month of Muharram. A number of men disputed deductions made from their pay on account of clothing issues made on payment. Clothing issue vouchers were examined and these also were unsigned, undated and in pencil. Orders for all store equipment, etc., are of course made from this office but so far as I could see articles received have not been checked before payment has been made. Thus some 250 rifles recently received from the B*S.A. factory in England which have been paid for/&lt;§) for are still in the packing cases in which they were shipped. There is also no check that such articles have been entered in the stock register. Office of the Superintendent of Police . The Superintendent of Police has an office at the Fort which forms the Lines and Headquarters of the Police Force. He has one clerk to assist him. This clerk also maintains all the Lanes records. The records of this office were in some confusion and it was difficult to find any system or any indication as to what records were meant to be kept here, at the Adviserate, or at the Police Station. X found two cup-boards stacked with jumbled papers some of which had been eaten by ants and some of which were almost illegible through mould. They consisted of such things as correspondence concerning driving licences, undated lists of men eligible for good conduct pay, receipts for clothing allowance recoveries, warrants of commitment, orders from the Commandant, old driving licences a Ians and miscella neous petitions and letters. They bore no indication of any action having been taken on them. There is no correspondence register. The Superintendent of Police maintains no crime register and there are no criminajL records in this office. I could find no distribution statement showing the sanctioned strength of the Force. The order book is very incomplete and many of the orders are unsigned and undated. There are no schedules of training. Punishments and Discipline * All punishments are dealt with summarily. The Superintendent of Police has opened an orderly room/room register in which all punishments inflicted by him are entered* His powers of punishment have not been defined, but the following have been inflicted by him s- 1. Extra parade drill 2* Confinement to lines 3* Loss of good conduct pay for periods up to one year 4* Fines up to Hs*5/~ 5* Reduction? 6. Dismissal 7* Imprisonment up to two weeks 8* Whipping up to 16 lashes* With the exception of dismissal it appears that any of these punishments may be combined with any other. 'Thus on 3 - 8 - 39 one Balal bin Rashid was sentenced to a fortnights imprisonment, loss of his good conduct pay and 16 lashes. It is not clear whether there is a right of appeal to the Commandant, and so far as I can see no punishment orders issued by the Superintendent of Police have been modified or reversed by the Commandant. Since the appointment of Shaikh Khalifah as Superintendent of Police and the institution of a daily orderly room, punishments have been fairly frequent. Since July of last year 138 men have been punished by the Superintendent of Police and of these cases 13 were direct insubordination to Ron-Commis sioned Officers, 6 concerned criminal acts (mostly stealing) and the majority of the remainder, absence from parade or duty and slackness while on sentry duty. Prior to the appointment of Shaikh Khalifah severe punishments were less frequent, so far as can be seen from the records that exist. Punishments inflicted by the Superintendent of Police have not been/been entered in punishment sheets kept for each man. I am informed that the Bahrain Courts refuse to take cognisance of complaints either civil ©r criminal against Police officers. Prom the record of punishments, the standard of parade, my inspection of the Police Station and posts, and from the difficulties experienced when extra duties were imposed on the Police on the out break of war, I should say that the standard of discipline can be described only as fair. Discipline cannot be maintained if men know that supervision is not constant or thorough and that corrupt practices go unchecked. Investigating officers, the Lines Staff and particularly the Lines Clerk seem to have had a fairly free hand in the past, with the knowledge that their work would never be inspected, and this can only have had a very bad effect on discipline. The reputation of the Lines Clerk is particularly bad, and although, with the records in the present state, it would probably be difficult to establish a case against him, I consider that there can be little doubt that he has been guilty of corruption and embezzlement. Leave. Leave is sanctioned by the Superintendent of Police or Commandant. There is no limit to casual or medical leave which are on full pay. Leave is earned at the rate of l£ months per year and usually granted after two years service. There are no orders regarding leave and there are no separate record entries being made in the pay register. Posting s/Postings Postings are not controlled by the Saperintendent ©f Police but left to the Senior Havildar in Lines. Licenses for arms . Arms licenses for Bahrain subjects are issued from the Superintendent of Policed office and records are kept by the Lines Clerk. The fee is Rs.l/- license. As no entry is made in any cash register it is difficult to find out whether this money has been properly remitted t© the Bahrain Government. I note that a license was recently issued to a European British subject of the Bahrain &gt; Petroleum Company which should have been issued from the Agency. Police Fund . There is a Police fund from which games equipment, sports prizes etc., are paid, and from which loans are made if necessary to Police Officers. Sources of income are s- 1. Fines 2. -/2/- are taken from the -/6/~ deducted per head for the dhobi and barber 3.6-^% of the returns of the Lines shop. The balance at present is Bs.700/- and an account has just been opened with the Eastern Bank. Rewards . There is no definite allotment for payment of rewards to policemen or informers by the Superintendent of Police.LINES Staff* There is no one in separate charge of the lines. The Senior Havildar, Nadir Khan, is in charge of parades, transfers, range practices and the issue of rations. The issue of arms and ammunition is in the hands of an illiterate N.C.O. and the Lines Clerk appears to deal with all other matters. Tn addition to Havildar Nadir Khan there are 2 drill instructors both of whom are Indians. They are responsible for the training of recruits. Buildings . Buildings are on the whole good especially the new barracks. There are however, one or two criticisms. The armoury is inadequate fear the number of rifles. There is no proper room for the Quarter Guard. There is no separate magazine, all ammunition being kept in the Armoury. The lower room of the new tower which is being built in the North-East corner of the Fort is, I understand, to be used as an armoury. This is out of the sight of the Quarter Guard sentry. The Quarter Guard has no lock-up and policemen punished with confinement are sent to the jail cells. Although they are usually placed in a separate cell and do not work with the prisoners, I consider this most undesirable. Most of the married men in lines live in rt barastis ,t close to the fort. 12 married quarters have recently been built and when funds are available it is hoped that more will be constructed. Recruits ♦ There are at present 30 recruits. Recruits are enlisted at different times and are placed on duty at the jail until there are sufficient to form a aquad for training. Recruits/ HBIHBHBhhhhhh‘Ts/zst necruits are in two squads, one containing 18 men and the other 12 • Those in the first squad have done 3 months* training and those in the second 2 months* Their training lasts for 6 months* These squads are in charge of Indian instructors who keep their own programme. There is no examination at the end of the training but each is supposed to pass a musketry test, before being drafted into the ranks. Men who have failed, however, have been kept in the Police* During musketry training each man fires 160 rounds. ^ The first part of the course consists of a practice at short range (25 yards). The miniature rifles being all unserviceable this practice is fired with .303 ammunition. The second part and the test take place in the open range. The test consists of grouping at 100, application at 200, sharp shooting at 200, and application and rapid firing at 300. In addition to musketry, recruits are trained in the following subjects:- Squad drill, Rifle excercise, extended order drill, bayonet fight ing and guard duty. Line Programme . There is no written Time Table in Lines but the following appears to be the programme:- 6 a.m. reveille, 6.30 - 8.30 parade, 8.30 Orderly room, 9.15 relief for guards are marched off, 9.30 meal, 3.15 to 4.15 games and parade for recruits, 5.30 meal, 6.00 retreat, 7.00 roll call, 9.15 first post, 10.00 last post, 10.15 lights out. Parade♦ All men present at the lines attend morning parade. Sections are in charge of Non-Commissioned Officers/Officers who are responsible for the training carried out* These Non-Commissioned Officers for the most were part have not been instructed themselves since they / recruits, and those I saw in parade were not impres sive* Parades are under the general charge of the Senior Havildar (Nadir Khan) ♦ The Superintendent cf Police attends parade twice a week* Physical Training * Recruits are given physical training only twice a week* The remaining sections on parade are instructed in physical training every other day* The time alio ted is three quarter of an hour from 6.30 to 7.15. Physical training carried out as at present can have little beneficial effect. The main fault lies with the instructors who for the most part can neither instruct nor demonstrate* Apparatus work was particularly feeble. No physical training tables exist* There is no parade state showing the number of men posted at the Fort, the number on parade and the number sick or absent for other reasons. As has been stated there are no schedules of training* There is no training in Lathi fighting, or fire control for dispersing mobs. There is no training in Police work. Certain men were recently selected for training in traffic duty and were instructed by the Superintendent Police for 3 days and then sent on point duty. The first man on point duty I spoke to informed me that he had taught himself. Each man fires a yearly musketry course which/which consists of the same open range practices as fired by recruits. Results do not appear to be particularly good for the number of rounds fired. I examined the scores of 66 men who had fired their last years’s course and of these 26 only had passed. The score required for a pass is less than 60% of the possible. School . A school has recently been established and is run by an Arab Clerk from the Offices of the Bahrain Government who is paid an allowance of Rs.25/« per month. He teaches Arabic and English to the men of the band only. Postings . Postings are dealt with by the Senior Havildar Instructor Nadir Khan. The periods of duty are as follows:-* Muharraq, ) Hedd, ) Jidda, ) One month Jebel &amp; refinery, ) H.H. the Shaikh’s Guard) Fort Jail I Men posted to all other duties, that is to say Manama, Police Station duties, Bazaar patrol duties, traffic duty and guard duty are relieved daily. The Police Force is divided into 26 sections of which 2 are for recruits. Each section has one or a. koiiL' two Non-Commissioned Officers and^lO men. Two sections are alloted for the Manama Police Station and these relieve each other daily from the Fort and are changed after one month. A similar arrangement exists for bazaar beats and guards. One section only is employed, half the section going on duty one day and half the next The/Z 3@ The posting register is kept in Urdu. There appears to be no system of postings which are left to the discretion of the Senior Havildan Clothing. The following is the sanctioned issue of clothing and equipment for man on enlistment 1.

Each man receives a clothing allowance at Ks.3/~ per mensem. When issues are made an issue voucher is prepared by the Lines Clerk in pencil which is always unsigned and undated. The name of the article with its value is entered and deductions for clothing issued on payment are made at the time of disbursing pay. A single stock register is maintained for clothing, equipment, arms, ammunition, jail property and Government stores. This register was not up to date. This stock register has never been checked.Shirts and shorts are mde up by the Lines tailors and there is no cheek on the amount of Khaki drill and twill he uses« Shirts and shorts are not made to measure, but in 3 sizes. The clothing godown was in a state of confusion. It contained amongst other things cases of old clothing and equipment fit for destruction, friction tubes and some gun powder for the saluting gun, a stock of paints, the duplicate keys of the jail and a variety of boxes and cases mostly empty. Clothing was not properly stored and cloth for issue to the tailors kept in a separate store. There is no diagram to show how kits should be laid out for inspection and nothing is laid down regarding the type of Mufti men are required to wear when off duty. Kit inspections are not held regularly and apparently only once a year. The record of the last kit inspection I found in the bottom of cupboard with no action having been taken on it® Equipment * Equipment is dealt with on the same lines as clothing . The various rooms used as stores require turning out and a great deal of useless material can be destroyed. Neither beds nor boxes are provided for the men. There is no stock of spare hand-cuffs and those which I saw were old and rusty. Arms and Ammunition . The Police have at present 775 rifles on their books of which 125 are of 1912 manufacture, 50 of 1919 and the remaining 600 were purchased in 1938 and 1939. In/In addition there are 20 Mark 1 L.S. rifles of 1902 manufacture which are unserviceable# 16 of the 775 rifles are also unserviceable# There are also 12 V#B# Guns which were purchased last year. There are 6 .455 Service revolvers - all in good repair. Ammunition which is stocked in boxes in the armoury consists of the following :~ 1 box (300 rounds) .455 Service revolvers ammunition dated 1929 jo 0 I boxes (84i0©roiinds each of .303) Mark VII ammunition dated 1917 12 boxes of Mark 6, .303 ammunition dated 1908. The Mark 6 ammunition is naturally useless and u he Mark VII must be poor and probably to some extent responsible for the comparatively poor results obtained during the firing of musketry courses. I was informed that some of the boxes of Mark VII ammunition which have been opened were found to have such a high proportion of mis-fires that they were left and others opened. I was also informed that, the 1908 ammunition used to be issued to Naturs but that it had now been withdrawn. Inspection showed that not only are Naturs still equipped with it but the Police at Muharraq and Hedd also. A supply of 100,000 rounds of fresh ammunition is expected shortly. The issue of arms and ammunition is in charge of an illiterate Non-Commissioned Officer who keeps the keys of the armoury. The process is very vague and depends on memory. Rifles for the Section on prisoners* escort duty are issued daily and placed in the jail godown the keys of which are kept by the I^/Naik of the Section. The reason for this was stated to be that the Non—Comnissioned Officer/A Barber shop with 3 men is maintained and paid for by a deduction of eight annas per head of which two annas go to the Police fund*Officer in charge of the armoury cannot always be present• A register of ammunition expended during ranges practices is kept by Havildar Nadir Khan. Although proper forms exist for recording the results of such practices) these are not always used and the number of rounds used is not checked with the number issued. Deductions from the total number of rounds possessed are made monthly and adjustments made in the general stock register. The Mark 6 ammunition which has been withdrawn from Maturs is not shown anywhere and no responsible officer has ever checked the ammunition. So far as I can see there is nothing to prevent any amount of it going astray. For some reason empties are kept in the armourer’s shop and I would estimate the number which has accumulated to be 20,000. Armourer’s shop . This requires much improvement. The armourer is merely a carpenter and has no knowledge of fire arms. There is no proper vice to hold rifles in and the most of the tools are rusty. The only two cleaning rods possessed were so thick with rust as to be useless, Eiforts are being made to obtain a trained armourer from India. Spare parts . None. Dhobi and Barber . A Lines Dhobi is paid for by deductions of eight annas per head at the time of disbursing pay. Of the eight annas six annas go to the Dhobi and two annas to the Police Fund. Sr- 'V- Tailors . Two tailors have been appointed for the making/^ &gt; 7 ® making of uniforms. One is paid as.60/- per month and the other Rs.50/-. ^ Messes. A scale of rationing exists as below (a) Police A single monthly ration consists of l Rice Rangoon! Flour Karachi No.2 Ghee Khaldi Dhall Mung Dhall Nikhi Firewood Meat Masala Onions Garlic Soda Salt Vegetables 22^ lbs 222 - lbs 3-14/16 lbs 1-14/16 lbs 1-14/16 lbs 60 lbs 3-14/16 lbs 6/16 lbs l£ lbs l/3rd oz 1/16 lbs lbs -/?/- Cb) Prisoners. Flour Karachi No .2 Ghee Khaldi Dhall Maso or Salt Firewood Masala Onions Garlic Soda Tamarind vegetables 30 lbs 16/16 lbs 3-12/16 lbs l£ lbs 60 lbs 6/16 lbs 1^ lbs l/3rd oz 1/16 lbs 1—4/16 lbs -/ 5 /- Rations are issued in the first week of the month for a full month. Married men in Lines receive a daily issue. Issues are made by the Senior Havildar Nadir Khan. He reports each day to the Lines Clerk the number of rations issued. The Lines Clerk main tains a register of names with columns for each day of the month. He has no idea to whom rations have been issued and apparently places marks against names at random to indicate that the rations have been issued. He states that the only check that issues have been correctly made is the absence of complaintsHe admits that his register is meaningless* The number of rations issued during the month of Muharram does not tally with the number of pays shown in the pay bill to have been drawn for that month. Six extra rations appear to have been drawn. ^ Cooks. There are two cooks for the Lines who are assisted by prisoners. Their pay is 3s.36/- per month with rations. Food for men on duty in Manama i.e. at the Police Station or on guard duty is cooked at the fort and distributed by prisoners. Ho 11 - Call. Roll call is said to be called from the postings register but with the register in its present state this must be difficult. It is more probable that Non-Commissioned Officers are simply asked if all in their sections are present. Ho. written report on absentees is presented. 4 Games. These are held every day for recruits and twice a week for others. It seems a pity that more interest is not taken in games and hockey or football teams trained up to a standard which would enable them to compete with other local teams.' C ORDERLY OFFICER. Havildars in Lines are Orderly- Officers for a week at a time a No duties have 'been laid down in writing hut they are supposed to inspect all guards at night# In addition they are responsible for marching off relief guards from the fort and are liable to be sent with parties of police whenever required. They make no written report. In addition to the Orderly Officer an Non Commissioned Officer has been made responsible for the cleanliness of the lines 6 He is in charge of the sweepers and inspects the fort,family quarters and gardens. He is al% responsible for the removal of intunders. TRANSPORT. The police possess one w pick up ,f and one lorry and seven motor cycles. 5 of these were recently purchased primarily for war duties. There is also a police launch with a crew of five and a dhow with a crew of two. The Superintendent of Police is issued with a State car. ACCOUNTS. A permanent advance of ^ 250/- is kept at the Port. All small routine expenditure is paid for out of this and an account of expenditure is main tained by the Lines Clerk which is checked by the Accounts Officer with payment orders and receipts. Police stations and post submit monthly billsr for sums expended on taxi hire,food for prisoners etc. and these and other bills are entered in a contingent bill which is drawn every month.The cash book is not checked by the Superintendent of Police. M OUNTED POLICE AND CAMEL SECTION. The strength of the Mounted Police is 1 Naik,l L/Naik and 20 men.pgMHMV' ! I W 6 There are 51 horses* The camel police consists of 1 Naik f l I/Naii and 16 men with 22 camels. Pour syces are also employed for stable cleaning. The duty of the camel police is to patrol the coast and more inaccessible parts of the Island. There are no written orders regarding these patrols. The mounted (horse) police do not patrol and always remain present at Headquarters. The camel section provide patrols consisting of four men who are out usually for four days at a time. As soon as a patrol returns another takes its place. The general route followed is Budeya,Zekrit,Amar,Muttala,Dair, Jau,Askar,Sitra and back to the fort# HORSES AND TRAINING. The standard of horsemanship of the mounted (horse) section is poor.Riding school work consists of simple follow-my-leader evolutions^ 6ireles,figures of eight,and turns from line at the trot and canter are not known.Many have not learnt to sit properly on a horse and ride with stirrups much too short. The Naik in charge himself did not know how the reins should be held when riding with both hands.Jumping was particularly poor. There is no training in the use of batons. A fair knowledge of troup drill is possessed. Turn out was good but bridles were often badly fitted. Hose bands were much too loose and throat lashes far too tight. POLICE STATION AND POSTS. An crime is dealt with at the Manama police Station which is the only police station in Bahrain. Police posts exist at Muharrak and Hedd and prior to the outbreak of war police gsliae were also posted at Hawar. POLICE STATIONS. The strength of the Police Station is V ; T ''T” A I %wiii2 EavIldars and one section Duties are allotted as follows 1. 1 Havildar investigates cases concerning persons subject to Agency and Joint Courts♦ 2* i Havildar deals with cases which concern Bahrain subjects* 3* 1 non-coramissicned officer and 2 men visit all mail ships and assist the Passport Officer# 4# One men is sent for duty at the court of the Indian Assistant (Agency),one is present at the Bahrain Courts and a third is sent to the offices of the Bahrain Government apparently for the delivery of important messages • 5# The night guard at the Adviser ate is also provided from the Police Station and consists of three men* 6© A sentry is posted at the Police Station. In addition there are two literate policemen/ who maintain the records* The L/Naik in charge of the section arranges the distribution of duties* BUILDINGS. A rough sketch of the building is shown occupying about a half of the area of the building* Next in size is the room used as an office,investiga ting Officer^ room,waiting room,strong room and record room through which prisoners have to pass when being taken to and from the lock up* The barrack is also used as a guard room,where rifles• iu,-. ■SOS 1 and ammunition are kept# It is clear that from all points of view the “building is most unsuitable# It is too small,badly arranged and provides no accommodation for investigating officers who both live near the fort. This means that usually at night there is no responsible person present* The lock up was filthy and the latrines the cleaning of which,according to an order issued by Hie State Engineer when acting as Commandant^ is the responsibility of the guard commander were in a disgusting state# ARMS AND AMMUNITION* Each man brings his own rifle and 20 rounds of ammunition with him from lines# Ammunit ion remains in bandoliers which are usually hung on the wall of the barrack# The rack has no lock ing device. EQUIPMENT 1 * BEDS . ETC* There are three cupboards which are used for records,stolen property,jail property,printed forms,money,and miscellaneous equipment# The only proper place for storing valuable property is a safe which is inside the lock up 0 Beds are provided by the Government and are in good repair# There appear to be only four pairs of handcuffs and these are without chains and very rusty# No lathis are kept here and there are no torches or lamps# No cycles are provided* There is no police station Botice Board# INVESTIGATIONS AND RECORDS* Gases for tra^L by Agency or Joint Courts are investigated by Havildar All Mirza and those for Bahrain Courts by Havildar Mahmud. Investigatior of cases is very brief end most of it left to the |These forms correspond to the charge sheet required by Section 173 Cr* Procedure Code* tr Courts# There is no register for First Information Reports,as required under section 154 Criminal Pro cedure Code : no diaries are kept as laid down in section 172 Criminal Procedure Code, and plans of the scenes of crime and inventories of stolen property recovered are seldom prepared* The only Police record of a case is a brief report of the f uu I facts entered in the forms^and copied into a com plaints register* Knowledge of the law and procedure applicable to foreigners is very scanty as neither of the Havildars knows sufficient English to be able to read the English copy of the Criminal Procedure Code in the Police station* The Superintendent of Police visits the Police Station every day and discusses cases with the Investigating Officers but with no record of what has taken place investigations cannot be properly directed* It may be noted that all complaints civil or criminal are in the case of Bahrain subjects recorded in the police station and reported to the court* Civil cases are not investigated* RECORDS* There is no police station daily diary* There is no proper correspondence register but only one in which copies of letters issued from the Police station are entered* There is no^erime register,previous convictions being dealt with by local knowledge;there is no register of police station property,stolen property and jail property. There are no records of standing orders, charge notes,minutes by officers or history sheets of notorious bad characters* Such records as there are are maintained by two policemen# One is responsible for case reports and bail bonds and maintains the complaintsv dated Preliminary report ^JL^I £%$\ ' . .*.« ^um'be’ d^’ r J &lt;&gt;'&gt;*equivalent to To The Bahrain Court ^ ^ jS »J! aSC^ J* ^ ^t»5l ^-uJl Ji&lt;r Name of complainant address Name of accused O* .nil Kind of offence Time and place of occurance of &lt;*» the offence statement of his comi aint Jl .statement of accused Witness of complainant witness of accused Remarks by policeregisters,and the second keeps a register of summons received,mekes entries in the register of letters issued from the police station and maintains the lock up register. The records are in a state of confusion. Papers jumbled together in cup boards contained such things as letters to Havildars asking them to frightenjservants alleged to have been abusive, receipts for sums recovered in execution proceedings, alans,medical reports,certificates of fitness to drive motor vehicles,recovery lists,complaints petitions,bail bonds and 6 warrants of arrest issued by the District Court in 1935. Case^ reports are numbered serially and files closed yearly. Until very recently the results of cases were never recorded. Case PROPERTY. Disposal orders on case property ^re i^ot always obtained and amongst other items/££#&lt;}$&amp; a package containing jewelry which no one knew any thing about and which had been in the police stat ion for over 7 years. Case property is not marked with the brief details of the case in which it has been recovered. RECOVERY OF FINES AND EXECUTION OF DECREES &gt; There being no other agency,the police i deal with attachment and sale orders from Bahrain and Agency Courts. It is a recognised practice for xx persons unable to pay the whole amount decreed against them to execute documents in the Police station for payment by instalments. Pines in criminal cases are often collect ed for the Bahrain Courts,. A note may be made here of the system ofaccoimts in the police station*Expenditure is shown in monthly bills which are sent to the Port for payment from the permanent advance .There may however be occasion in which immediate payment is required. The police station has no permanent advance and payment in such cases is made by borrowing from sums collected an fines or in \y execution of decrees* Thus on 15th Dul Haj an order was received from a Bahrain court directing the police to sell property to the value of R 5 14/~ in execution of a decree passed against one Said Qathan bin Said Naser. The decree holder and judgement d^ptor appeared in the police station on the 24 Dul Haj and executed a document agreeing to the payment of R 5 5/- per week. ^ 8/- had been paid and only R 8 5/- was present in the police station. The remainder I was informed had been spent for urgent requirements by the police. Amongst the envelopes containing money collected in this vay were several purses containing money and other valuable belonging to prisoners in the Fort jail* Enquiry produced the explanation that if such things were sent to the Fort the prisoners would never sed them again* LOCK UP. This lock up is used both as a police station lock up and judicial lock up requires much improvement. Besides being filthy,it appears that nothing except food is provided for prisoners or suspects* There are no blankets and those who are not looked after by their friends have to sleep on stone floor. There is no limit to the number of person who may be confined. Although the cost of rations for the police has risen from R 8 6/- to R 8 9/-^ is ® per head per month since war was declared the sanctioned payment for prisoners diet is still ~/2/« per head per day. In my opinion it is quite im possible to feed a man properly on such a sum when allowance is made for the profit of the contractor. In many cases additional supplies of food are brought by friends and relations. Two registers are maintained for the lock up,one for the purpose of calculating the number of prisoners fed from day to day and the second shows 1 the date of entry and release or removal of prisoners with brief details of their cases .Both these registers have been recently introduced. It ^ v/orth recording that the greatest complaint against the police appears to be the illegal use of this lock up. It Is said that persons are often detained for long periods without tra\|l. I could find no cases worthy of special mention from the register. It would however not be difficult to omit an entry in the register especially as it appears that inspections are never made. Under trial prisoners may be in the lock up for a month or more but there is no provision for their being allowed out for exercise. Smoking is apparently allowed without restriction as the floor was littered with cigarette ends. BAIL. ■ &gt; There is no bail bond form. Bail is only given with the permission of the Superintendent of Police or the Commandant and is always without surety. INQUESTS. Inquests reports are not drawn up by the police in accordance with section 174 Criminal Police Code. Investigation to establish the identityof bodies often washed ashore by the sea is made but no record of such investigations is kept* TRAFFIC CASES, A special register for motor traffic is maintained,the object of which is not clear* | The register was not up to date* There is no register of petty offences &lt; such as those against licensing and traffic Laws. Systematic checking of driving and other licenses is seldom carried out by the police.£ The number of men capable of reading the particul ars in a license is very small. The police issue trial licenses valid for one day only. These are issuedjfor W-S-O and books of licenses with foil and counter foil are kept at the Police Station. The cash collected is remitted yearly to the office of the State Engineer and I was told that as there was no proper receptacle for it in the Police Station it was kept by the clerk at his house. DISPOSAL OF GASES. Owing to the absence of records it was impossible to examine the speed of disposal of cases by Courts. As has been stated the results of cases » have only recently been recorded. I noticed hor.- ever that the disposal of case No. 4 of 1559- a simple traffic case took 24 days* BSATS. One section is sent from the Fort to provide patrols in the bazar. One half of the section is on duty from 7.50 till 11.50 and the other half from 11.50 till 5*50 .Men are sent to the motor stand,main bazar,vegetable market and cloth market. The non—conuiissioned officer incharge is responsible for visiting these places in turn and seeing that his men are carrying out their• A -L duties properly. OFFICER IN CHARGE. Neither of the two Havildars at the police station knew who was in charge. POSTS . The only two police posts are in n Muharrak and Hedd. Each has a strength of one sectic in charge of an Non Commissioned Officer. BUILDINGS . Below are rough sketches of the buildings. MUHARRAK POST. ^5 / [ Ibft 1 i L HEDD POST WASH nvj The Muharrak post is situated close to pier and is part of a large building occupied by natures and customs officials. The centre portion of the building is empty. • The post at Hedd is separated from other buildings and is generally satisfactory. 4T, 'b 'MUHARRAK The position of the police at Muharrak ie ohscure and when I enquired the nature of their duties I was told that there were noneo All police work is dealt with by the Nature* The headquarters of the Naturs is situated in the same building as the police post and contains a lock up. Complaints are registered there and a report sent to the Manama police station. In important cases an investi» gating officer is sent from Manama and in others the parties are sent to the police station. Orders from Courts including the service of summons and warrants are dealt with by the Naturs but a police Naik has been posted to work with them and act as a Liaison Officer. appear to The only duty which the police/perform in Muharrak is the occasional patrolling of the bazar by day. The following records are kept by a clerk at the Natur Headquarters. The registers were on the whole well maintained. 1 . Register of complaints 2 . Register containing copies of letters and reports issued from the Naturs Headquarters. 3. Register of summons received and returned and warrants. 4o Register of unserved summons and warrants. 5. Postings register. 6 . A file of alans issued by the Bahrain Govern ment* No cash register is maintained* EQUIPMENT . Beds are the property of the men and are brought with them from the fort. There are no handcuffs. ARMS AND AMMUNITION. Arms appeared in a satisfactory condi-condition 'but ammunition which is not brought out from lines by reliving sections included a number rounds of mark 6. HEDD. Complaints made at this post are recorded in a register which is alec the duty register. Copies are sent to the police station and prelimi nary investigations is carried out by the police at the post at Hedd and the Naturs at Muharrak. The police at Hedd carry out the only night patroling done by the police in the whole of Bahrain. Patrols are carried out between the hours of 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. by a party consisting of 3 men and one natur* ARMS AND AITOJNITION. Arms were in a satisfactory condition but ammunition again included 29 rounds of Mark 6. EQUIPMENT. Beds are the property of the men and brought with them from the Port. No lathis are kept at this post and the only two handcuffs were used on the door of the lock up and the box containing ammunition. ■|PART III PROPOSALS FOR REORGANISATION, Before considering any changes required in the present police adjninstration it is necessary to state clearly the duties which the police may be required to perform. They appear to be as follows !• The protection of Bahrain against tribal attacks from the mainland 2. The suppression of internal disturbances. 3* The prevention and investigation of Crimea 4. The provision of Guards of Honour on ceremonial occasions. Serious crime in Bahrain is very small and internal disturbances a^vuttl and it is clear that the main duties of the police are of a more military than civil nature. For this reason such training as is given is on military lines and the force has been organised on a military basis. Men of the type en listed practically all of them illiterate,cannot be expected to assimilate a knowledge of both military subjects and police work,and it is therefore,not surprising that the standard of police work is very low. What little knowledge those at present employed in case worljhave of law,procedure and methods of detection,they have taught themselves. TRAINING. The division of the force into sections in command of W 0 n Commissioned Officers is an obvious necessity for the performance of the military side of police duties,but such an arrangement end less difficulties in posting and control as far as men required for purely police purposes are concer ned • The obvious solution to remove thesedifficulties is to divide the force into a detachment of Armed Military Police and a body of c ivil police* The armed Military Police would be trained in military lines* They would perform the 1 st and 4th of the duties already enumerated and in addition would form a first armed reserve ready to come to the assistance of the police in ahy situation which had become beyond their control* Men of the civil police would be taught only that amount of squad drill,rifle excercise musketry etc. which a policdman is required to know and greater concentration would be made in police subjects such as lathi fighting,methods of dispersing mobs,duties and powers of a police officer,elementary law and procedure,traffic control,detection of crime,procedure in cases of accident etc#etc 0 Conditions of service,systems of promot ion,pay and allowances should be the same in both forces but a distinctive uniform should be evolved for the military police# The command of both forces would rest with Superintendent of Police,under the general direction of the Commandant# ESTIMATED STRENGTH REQUIRED FOR CIVIL AND MILITA RY POLICE* CIVIL . I estimate the strength of the force required to police Bahrain to be one Inspector three sub-inspectors, 11 Havildars, 15 Naiks, 20 L/ Naiks, and 141 men* The constitution of the force is shown in the distribution statement below and may be compared with the present strength shown at pageCIVIL Inspector Sub-Inspector Head Constables Constables Ist.Cl. 2nd.Cl» 5rd Cl . 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 20 12 6 4 6 3 2 1.Police Stations (a) Manama ) (b) Muharrak ) 1 2* Police posts Hedd Awali Pefinery 3.

Before examining these estimates it is necessary to decide at this stage whether the present system of maintaining watchmen or Nature should be continued or whether the Civil Police should assume their duties.The system of Naturs being responsiblefor watch and ward at night has been in operation dTor a large number of years and has on the whole worked very satisfactorily and with some readjust ments of the relations between police and Nature a further improvement should be possible.Politically the system has advantages and my own view is that at any rate for the present the arrangement should continue. POLICE STATIONS . I recommend the establishment of a separate Police Station at Moharrak whose jurisdic tion should cover the Island of Moharrak and the Uma Shejar al Kabir and al Saghir islets o f /Mx^keitHixscKKxSlxotKattKsiaxsayasB. This police station should be incharge of a sub-inspector who would also control the operations of police of Hedd andthe Nature.The police station at Man am ah for which a larger staff has been provided should have jurisdiction over the whole of th-% remainder of Bahrain and would control the police posts at Awali and the refinery and Nature. The Superintendent of Police will have a great deal of work in attending to the Armed internal adminstration of the Military Police and the civil police and in my opinion he will require an officer to assist him. I have there fore suggested the creation of a post of Inspector whose main duties would be (l) to act as second in command to the Superintendent of Police ( 2 ) the examination of cases which investigation officers have left as untraced and ( 3 ) the checking of the files of cases ready for prosecution.He could also be assigned such duties as the investigation of important cases in which Europeans were involved, the control of the traffic police and of any cases which concern ships at sea. He should prepare aa weekly report which would inelude(l) a statement of crime showing s cases reported,under investigation and sent for trial*( 2 ) a statement of cases disposed of hy the courts showing the result of each case and reasons for failure to secure convictions. His report could if necessary he extended to include observa tions on public opinion,youth movements etc e The suggested strength of the police stations has been worked out on the following be sis.

POSTS If the Natur posts are to be maintained I do not consider it necessary to increase the number of police posts beyond those already in existenceLIKES There must he a responsible officer in charge of lines« If the Head quarter of the force is run in the present confused way little can he expected of the remainder of the force. I have therefore recommended the establishment cf a Line Officer of the rank of Sub-Inspector. Jfe should be made responsible to the Superintendent of Police for the discipline,good conduct and training of all men of the civil police stationed in Lines or on standing guards. He should supervise and control the work of the Lines establishment and be respons ible for the correctness of the accounts# He shouldxfc be incharge of all clothing,equipment,arms and animun it ion, tents and stores kept at Head quarters and every half year should take stock of all Govern ment property in possession of the Civil and Armed Police Forces. He should visit the police dispensary end ensure that men are receiving proper attention and also exercise a general supervision over the running of the messes. He should be responsible for the train ing of the recruits of the Civil Police for musketry instructions and range practices,for constant inspections of all buildings for cleanli ness, for seeing that men are not absent from duty without permission,for the removal of strangers from the limits of his police lines and for the proper functioning of the Lines School. The keys of the armoury,cash chest and jail should remain in his personal custody# He should also be responsible for the proper manage ment of the jail. The remainder of the Lines staff should I consider consist of the followingHead Conata’bles 1st clas s 2nd class Chief Jail Instructor 1 Drill Insruetor - I Lines Clerk 1 Clothing and equipment clerk 1 For the mainionajaee, issue and check of arms and ammunition 1 Total 4 I 3rd class Items No. 4*5,6 and 7 in the distribution statement require no comment# It is essential that the Superintendent of Police should have a separate office in which all records of matters dealt with personally by him can be kept and for this purpose I have provi ded for one clerk of the rank of Head Constable 1st class and one assistant clerk of the rank of Head constable 2nd class). These men will be required to deal with records of punishment promotions, character rolls. The Superintendent of Police should maintain all secret records personally. Provision has also been made for a clerk of the clerical establishment of the Bahrain Government to deal with accounts# In my estimate I have provided for a * section of camel police and recommended the abolition of the^ Mounted (Horse) Police. The main reason for their establishment was that their speed enabled them to reach quickly the remoter villages in case of necessity. Previously they were also used for petroling . Patrolling was given up as owing to the rough nature of the ground horses were continually going lame and at present the^ section remains constantly at headquarter. Arab ponies are for too hot to be trained for use again st crowds and I am convinced that the retention of the Mounted Police is not worth the expense. TheThe northern part of the Island is well roaded and most places can 'be reached oy motor car or motorcycle. Villages in the central part of Bahrain can generally 'be reached 'by car and those on the coast 'by launch. In roost cases it would 'be quicker to send men in a pick-up or lorry to the rest of the journey to be performed on foot,than for Mounted policemen to be sent from Headquarter. I can see no justification for the posting of police at Hawar. The population of this Island is never more than 150 and during the summer it is almost completely deserted. I have therefore not included a police post at Hawar in my proposals. A leave reserve of 25 % for non-commissio ed officers and 33i % may seem high but I consider this essential if proper provision is to be made for all non-effectives i.e. recruits,leave,men under training,men sick etc. Leave is at present granted for 3 months every two years and if this is continued, and I see no reason to make any alteration,some 18 Head Constables and men could be on leave at any one time. This would leave some 26 men to provide for recruits and other non nearest accessible point effectives©mW*)i~ tVi-jiff V' APMlim MILITARY POLICE, X Jamadars Havildars Naiks . l/Naikg. .

He should be assisted by a Havildar Major who would act as second in command and be responsible for training recruits and a Havildar who would deal with all matters concerning equip ment the issue of arms and ammunition and the organisation of supplies when the force is away from Headquarters* The platoon should be organised on ordinary Military Lines with men of the machine gun sections trained in the use of rifle for occasions when automatic weapons are not required* Machine gun sections should be commanded by Naiks with a L/Naik as second in command. Each platoon should be in charge of a Havildar* It may be noted here that platoons should normally be controlledby menjpf officer rank but this has not been recommended as the expense would be beyond the resources of the Bahrain Government 0 A reserve of 25 % of the strength of each rank has been made to provide for non-effectives. I find it impossible to recommend the retention of the band in its present scale of 2 non commissioned officers and 16 men. The cost of the reorganisation if carried out on the lines recommen ded may be considerable and all expenditure which is not absolutely essential must be cut down. Bugler; are a necessity in Lines and I have suggested the provision for a small band of bugles two side drums and a big drum for marching purposes. Members of the band should be posted to sections and given proper training. It may be considered that the force of twe platoons would be too small for the duties which might be required of it but it should be remembered that in the event of an external attack or serious internal i&amp;o disturbances in addition to assistance proved by the British Government it would be possi ble to mobilise all available men from the civil police and also the Naturs.Offices and Control * For the efficient running of a Police Force a set of departmental rules to cover all sides of *...+* * ... .... Police administration is required* To evolve such rules would be a lengthy task and unfortunately Provincial Rules under the Indian Police Act are too complicated to be taken as a guide. All that can be done here is to make general provision for the more important branches of Police work. The Commandant of Police must retain full powers to deal with all matters concerning the police as he considers desirable in the interests of the State, but certain powers, duties and res ponsibilities should be delegated to the Superin- tendant of Police under his general supervision. For the present I would recommend the following division of records between the offices of the Commandant and Superintendent of Police. commandant 1. All papers concerning the fram ing and sanctioning of Budget Estimates. Sperintendent of Police . 1* Records of crime. 2. Postings. 2. Distribution statement for 3 civil and armed police. 3. English correspondence with the Agency and forms for the 4 supply of clothing and equipment. 5 4. Records of building programme and repairs to buildings. 6 5* Records of all officers, leave promotions and punishment. 7 6. Copies of Defence Plans and other schemes. 8 7. SSCC Standing orders. 9 8. Special reports. 10 11 Appointments, punishments, leave and promotions except in the case of officers. Training. Files containing copies of all reports made to the commandant. Weekly reports submitted by the Inspector. General inspection reports by the Commandant and Standing orders. Copies of defence and other plans. Registration of Arms. Accounts. Order Book.It will be noted that accounts have not been included amongst the records kept by the Commandant. The only person who can be responsible for the proper control of routine police expenditure is the Sperintendent of Police. Pay bills and contingent bills must be prepaired in his office where all the records exist for checking i.e. records of promotion, reductions, dismissals, appointments etc. Pay bills and copies of contingent bills etc• must be filed by the office of the person responsible for the preparation and correctness. To enable the account ant of the Bahrain Government to check such bills would require a duplication of work and in any case he appears to have neither the time nor the staff for the work. Bills should be prepared in the office of the Superintendent of Police signed by him in token of their correctness and passed to the Treas ury Accountant, who would only be responsible for the correctness of the totals, the presence of the Superintendent of Policed signature, his initials on any alterations and erasures and who would see that all increases or reductions in and deductions from pay are accompanied by the number and date of the order in the Order Book. Pay roll should then be signed by the accountant and a summary of it sent to the Treasury Officer for payment. After payment has been made from the Treasury the receipted summary should be returned to the Accounts Officer for entry in his cash book. All bills prepared by the Superintendent of Police should show the Budget Head under which they are to be drawn and a general cash register for monetary receipts and expenditure must be kept by him. A second register showing the monthly expenditure under the variujos heads should be maintained and receipt and voucher forms should be kept at the office. A Ty-r (g) It must be emphasized that the transfer to the Superintendent of Police of only routine expenditure is suggested and the control of major works such as buildings, clothing and equipment orders etc must remain in the hands of the Commandant. I suggest however that the Superintendent of Police be supp lied with full details of the sanctioned Budget est imates and expenditure controlled by the Commandant. The object of this general proposal is to give the Superintendent of Police real responsibility which in my view is only possible if finance is to some extent dealt with by him. The details of procedure should be worked out by the Accounts Officer of the Bahrain Government. The disbursement of pay for both the civil and Armed Military Police should be carried out by the Lines Officer. Permanent advances of not more than Rs.100/- for Lines and Hs.60/- for Police stations should be sancti* oned, expenditure from which should be controlled by the Superintendent of Police. The Accountant in the office of Superintendent of Police should be a member of the clerical estab lishment of the Bahrain Government experienced in Accounts work. Petty repairs should be dealt with by the Sup erintendent of Police and a definite allotment made for the purpose. Major projects should be dealt with by the Commandant. The records of all Police officers above the rank of Havaldar should be kept by the Commandant. These should include character rolls showing date of appointment , age, origin i.e. Persian, Bahraini etc. Educational qualifications, details of promotions, punishments and leave and mention of any specially good work done or rewards received. &amp;^ y, ® In addition each officer should have a personal file in which all correspondence affecting him per sonally should be filed. Such correspondence should include leave applications and orders, the record of any departmental proceedings against an officer, medical reports and such like matters. The power to punish , promote, reduce or dismiss, to grant leave, sanction increments and to transfer officers will rest with the Commandant. I recommended the framing of plans for action to be adopted for Moharram, serious disturbances in the jail, the disposal of unlawful assemblies and the general mobilisation of Naturs and men available from the civil police in the event of serious internal disturbances. Copies of such plans should be kept both in the office of the Commandant and the Superin tendent of Police. Standing orders should be issued by the Comm andant only and should be numbered serially, copies being kept in both the offices. The Commandant must be kept informed of the occurrence, progress of investigation and final re sult of all important cases and information by tele phone is not sufficient. When a case of the category shown in the XXXM list below is reported, the Superintendent of Police and the Commandant must be informed by telephone (at present there is no telephone in the houde of the Superintendent of Police and its installation should be carried out without 2D£2£X delay). A copy of the first information report should be sent to the Superintendent of Police who should make out a report in English for submission to the Commandant. Continuation reports should be submitted until the case has been finally disposed ofi .are:- The cases which should be specially reported 1. Offences committed by Europeans and Americans. 2. Cases of unnatural or sudden deaths of persons of importance and Europeans and Americans. 3. Counterfeiting coins. 4. Theft of fire-arms. 5. All serious charges against the police. 6. Robbery with murder or grevious hurt. 7. Murder or attempted murder. 8. Cases of clashes between Europeans and Americans and the local inhabitants. 9. Rioting. 10. Escapes from Police custody. 11. Tehft ©15 robbery ©f Government treasuries. 12. Other cases which through special circumstances may be of importance. Files containing special reports should be kept in both offices. Crime reports by the Inspector should be for warded to the Commandant for information and after any action*^.thought necessary has been taken on them they should be returned to the Superintendent of Police for filing.Office of the Superintendent of Police * 1. Records of crimes will be dealt with under M Police Stations'* for the civil police* 2* The postings of men up to and including Head Constables 1st Class must be dealt with personally by the Superintendent of Police and not left to the discretion of subordinates. Separate register should be maintained for each rank and in case of men a table of rotation of duties should be laid down with the period assigned for each post away from Head Quarteij. Posting for the civil police may present some difficulty owing to the absence of married quart ers at Police Stations or posts* Under the present system it is possible to allow men to remain at Headquarters for a large portion of the year as out of 26 sections not more than seven are posted away from Head Quarters and the remainder are available for general duties. Sections sent for duty at the Police Station only remain there for 24 hours and spend the next day at the Port where thay are free for duty after attending morning parade* Men complain bitterly if kept away from their families and until married quarters have been provided at Police Stations and posts periods of duty will have to be short. Rotation should be on the following lines 1. Recruits course. 2. Police Station. 3. Head Quarters (Jail Guards and Standing Guard) 4. Police Post. (Jedda, Awali, Refinery, Hedd.) 5. Head Quarters. 3. Schedules of training for recruits and men of both branches of the forces, for traffic police and for N.C.Os, Head Constables and^selected for promo tion should be made out by the Superintendent of Police and submitted for the approval of the Comman dant. For this purpose I recommend the purchase ofSerial Name No# and father 1 s name. of copies of the Punjab Police Manual, Small Arms Training Vol. 1. and Infantry Training# 4# (a) The selection of recruits is a matter of gioc great importance with which I consider the Comm-* andant should deal personally in consultation with the Superintendent of Police# I suggest that recruit ment should take place four times a year at the Office of the Superintendent of Police. Dates should be fixed and public notified# All men applying for enlistment during the year should be first measured by the Sup erintendent of Police and if up to the standard their particulars should be taken and entered in a register and they should be told the date on which to appear before the Commandant# This register should have a column for the orders of the Commandant and the result of medical examinations. The following form is sugg ested. Recruits Register# Resid- Nation- Age. Height. Chest Orders Medi- If enroli enee. ality. measu- of cal ed date rement. Comman- re- of enroll- dant. port. ment. - The minimum ©#* height should be fixed at 5 feet six inehesand chest measurements 32 inches .with an ex pansion of two inches. The age limit should normally % be 25 but this should be relaxed at the discretion of the Commandant. In order to obtain if possible men of good family and education amongst N.C.Os of the Civil Police, I recommend that a certain proportion be re cruited directly to the rank of Head Constable 1st class.This proportion should not exceed 2/5th of the total strength of this rank. It is a matter of foremost importance that eff orts be made to attract a better class of men to the police forefc who would command respect and who would also be fit for promotion to the rank of Sub-Inspector. The two chief obstacles in the way of this are I think public opinion and conditions of service. Arab public/ opinion yu public/so far as I have been able to ascertain it is very mueh against the Police and views with particular disfavour the fact that practically all the important posts in the force are held by Indians and Persians. The elimination of all Indian influences is in my view particularly important and an effort should be directed towards improving the relations between the public and the police by lectures on behaviour, in creased efficiency in dealing with criminal complaints and above all the stricter control over all ranks to prevent the abuse of priviliges. Men of the class of manumitted slaves can obviously nefcer command respect from the people and they should be totally eliminated from the civil police. As regards conditions of service, pay and allowan ces have been dealt with separately but in addition to this living conditions require improvement. Senior N.C.Os and officers must be provided with proper quar ters in which to live and work, men must be given proper beds to sleep in and boxes in which to keep their kit and other belongings. I feel sure that the right men for all ranks could be found if a recruiting drive in both towns and vill ages were instituted with the assistance of members of the Ruling Family, the educational Department and the local newspaper. If the changes recommended are brought into effect it should be possible to popularise the Police Force as (1) pay would compare favourably with that offered for other forms of employment, (2) it provides permanent employment with free food, clthing and accomodation and, most important of all, in view of the high promotion of IJ.C.Os to men, it offers immense chances for promotion. The appointment of a member of the Ruling Family as Superintendent of Police has done a great deal to increase the prestige of the Police and as soon as the right type of 'Vi to \\ v • . MIlVlBMBflHttfi 4 :/ v '-A {n ■type men has been secured for the officer and Havildar ranks a further improvement will follow. The selection and appointment of directly re cruited Havildars 1st class should rest with the Commandant who would oour£e consult the Superinten dent of Police. A register of candidates on the lines of the recruiting register should be maintained in the office of the Superintendent of Police. I see no objectisa in enlisting men for any de finite period. Resignations should be allowed at the discretion of the Commandant and Superintendent of Police after two months* notice or in the case of failure to give notice, the deposit of two months* pay. Age limits might be laid down for each rank which could be relaxed only on the approval of the Commandant. Punishments ♦ A scale of punishments should be laid down showing the powers of officers to inflict them and the right of appeal if any. A suggested scale is below Inspector Sub- Inspector, Jamadar. Head Constables. 1st cl.2nd cl.3rd cl. Hav. Naik. L.Naik. Commandant n n S.P. 1. Dismissal 2. Reduction. 3. Stoppage of increment &amp; forfeiture of service for incre ment. 4. Censure. 5.

Inspector, If' ' Jamadar. 1st cl. 2nd cl. 3rd cl. Hav. Naik. L.Naik. S.P. S.P. S.P Inspector. Sub-Inspec tor or Jamadar. I am strongly adverse to the imposition of fines as punisnment and do not consider that whipping should be included as a departmental punishment. Criminal cases should generally be tried judicially and any man sentenced to more than one month’s imprisonment should be dismissed. A right of appeal should exist from all major punishments inflicted by the Superintendent of Police. Major punishments should be the first three mentioned in the suggested scale. In the case of offences re should quiring major punishment a departmental enquiry/be held &amp;nd a brief record kept of the prosecution and defence evidence. The order or recommendation by the officer conducting the enquiry should be in de^taii. Such enquiries should not be conducted by an officer below the rink of Inspector. Men whose conduct is sub ject to such an enquiry should be placed under sus pension, transfered to lines if not posted there and paid a subsistence alio wane e of not more than 1/4 th of their pay, until the completion of the case. When orders have been passed men should be reinstated un less dismissed and if acquitted paid the remainder of their pay for the period spent under suspension. A punishment register in the following form should be opened. JUinu&amp;i Seri Dated Offender, gy whom Nature of Punishemnt. No. Rank No. punished, misconduct. Monthly extracts from the register showing the number of each type© of punishment inflicted should be pre pared for the information of the Commandant. v • 4 *■' ■ i a*' .AH punishments inflicted should be entered in red ink in character rolls . The only way of improving the working of the police and also of keeping police officers 'up to the mark” is by constant formal and informal inspections. Regular inspections of police stations, Lines and jail should be carried out once a year by the Commandant and Superintendent of Police each to cover a period of six months. Inspection reports should contain a statement of crime for the past six months on the following lines. A note should be made of the name of the inspect ing officer and the dates of inspection and when and by whom the station was last inspected. The report should contain notes on the following subjects:- 1. The state of crime generally, with reasons for any serious increase ana remarks on the working of the police. 2. Recoras. *3. Condition of buildings. 4. .Arms and ammunition. 5. Clothing and equipment. 6. Discipline. 7. Marne of the officer in charge with remarks on his ability and work. Inspection of Lines should include the following subjects. Cases Persons Property ! I 1 &lt;t&gt; Offences. « ■£ •H ■P • ! 05 O 1. Clothing and equipment. 2. .Arms and ammunition. Remarks3. Training. 4. Buildings. 5. Open range firing practice. 6. Records. 7. Officer in charge. 8. Jail records and the general running of 4fter any action called for has been taken reports they should be filed in the office Superintendent of police. Promotion s. ^ The following promotion Lists should be maintained separately for the Civil and Military Police in the office of the Superintendent of Police. 1. List Jl. For Constable^and men suitable for promotion to Head Constable 3rd class or L/Nuik. 2. List B. For Head Constables 3rd class and L/Naiks suitable for promotion to Head Constable or Naik. 3. List C# (a) For Head Constables 2nd class and Naiks fit for promotion to Head Constable 1st class or Havilaar. (b) For men in List C suitable through their general intelligence and education for advance ed training(in India) / 4 ' 4. List D. For Head Constables 1st class and Baviidars fit for promotion to officer rank. These lists should be kept confidentially and entries made personally by the Superintendent of Police. The Superintendent of Police should have the power sub ject to confirmation by the Commandant to include or re- move names from the first two lists and the remainder should be dealt with by the Commandant in consultation with the Superintendent of police. The Commandant should frequently inspect these four lists and initial entries made in them. All policemen promoted in rank should be on probation for one year and liable to reversion for un satisfactory conduct, without departmental proceedings. Opportunities for accelerated promotions must be provided for men of outstanding ability. the jail on such of theA division should be made in each list between literate and illiterate men and every effort made to increase the percentage of educated men in the N.C.O. ranks. Power to make promotion . i recommend that the Superintendent of Police be given power to promote up to the rank of Naik or Head Constable 2nd class , subject to the confirmation of the Commandant. Recommendations for promotion of the remaining ranks should be prepared by the Superinten dent of Police and orders issued by the Commandant. Records an all matters connected with the promotion of N.C.Os, Head Constables and men should be kept in the office of the Superintendent of Police and pro motion orders together with those issued in the case of officers entered in the police order book main tained by the Superintendent of Police. Order Book . The proper maintenance of an order book is a matter of the greatest importance. Entries should be number ed serially throughout the year and each day's orders (except standing orders) arranged in sections as follows (1) Training and inspection-including all orders re garding parades inspections and duties. (2) Establishment- Including orders regarding emoluments discharges, transfers, increases and decreases in str ength, promotions, reductions and leave. . Accounts- . — „. _ n .i (b) including orders for receipt ana pay ment of money, grant of allowances,realisation of deductions, over payments .etc from salaries. (4) Discipline- including orders regarding punishments rewards and all orders of a disciplinary nature. (5) Miscellaneous. I mmJ m ■ .

The pay and allowances at present, and those pro posed are shown in the statement below :- Allowances. Inspector. Sub. Inspector &amp;nd Havilders. Head Constables 1st class. ‘ooosed. 1753025 100-5-150 5G-1-6G At ire&amp;ent . Ifroposed 60 40 Haiks, Head Con stables 2nd class.

The pay of men cannot be reduced beloy/ of its present figure as this would have an immiii&amp;te effect on recruiting. The high rates of pay for coolie labour have also to be contended with. A labourer employed by the Bahrain Petr 4 oleum Coy. starts on a wage of -/12/- per day which inceases to is.-/14/- after six months and may rise as high as U.l/2/- per day. \ • w ■The initial pay of a police man must compare favourably with the highest labour rate. No police man ever consida ers that such things ass free quarters and clothing have any effect on his emoluments. A labourer earning is. 1/2/- per day would earn approximately is.20/- per month work ing 6 days a yyeek and if a police man staists at M.25/- he would be earning is.!/- MM per month more than this when the value of rations (is.6/- in peace time) is included. I recommend the abolition of the present system of granting good conduct pay after 2 years 1 service and the introduction of a scale of increments. It is essen tial particularly in the case of the civil police that men be given an incentive to serve a greater period than four years if the time spent in their training is not to be wasted. It is true that the high proportion of N.C.Gs to men in the proposed forces should provide considerable incentive but it is unlikely to be less than four years before a man is promoted and in the case of an illiterate man in the civil police it might be much longer. I consider also that the emoluments of a police man should increase as his usefulness increas es through experience. If clothing allowance be excluded, in regard to which see page below, the proposed rates for men are slightly less than before in the case of men staying for short periods only but become better than the preseit rate for men remaining in service for over seven years. It is considered impossible to increase the rate of pay of lowest ranks, as to do so would be costly and would involve an increase in the rates of all other ranks. The scale of pay recommended for the officer re cruits are based on the pay drawn by clerks in the em ploy of Bahrain Government.T- Tl k Pplice Stations, .posts and investigations . The first and foremost requirement for both police stations is the provision of suitable buildings. The Manama police station is situated in* the lower story of a building which is used as a Government Rest House. The site is excellent, but even if the whole building were utilised and extensive alterations effected I doubt whether the essential requirements for a police station could be provided for. This possibility should however be examined, as should the possibility of turning the building at Muharrak, which contains the police post and Naturs Headquarters, (a large portion of which is I understand empty), into a police station. The following need to be provided for:- 1. Married quarters for the office in charge and a proportion of M.C.Os and men. 2. An office for the Officercin Charge and station clerk. 3. A record room. 4. An armoury to be used also for the deposit of equipment and stolen property and store room for rations. 5. Separate lock up for men and women. Vvw 6. Separate barrack rooms for married N.C.Os. If fresh buildings can be contemplated I suggest the following rough plan as being the most suitable. Record Room Office i' t -Barrack -N.C.O - -N.C.0 i . 1 Lock Ud. =(= 4= Lock Ub. 1 --Armoury etc. Barrack (or Nature H.Q.) Store room for cycles etc. If possible the headquarters of the Naturs should be situated close to the police station or in the police station. At present in Manama the Naturs are some dis tance from the Police and have no telephone.Records. An essential requirement for the effective controll of crime is a simple but comprehensive system of Police Station records which will assist officers in charge of Police Stations and also enable the Commandant and Superintendent of Police to check all the activities of the police. The Officer in Charge, the Station clerk and his assistant should be responsible for the maintenance of the following registers. 1. A register of first information reports in the following form. (Sec. 155, Cr. P.C). Police Station.......... Date and hour of occurrence. 1. Date and hour of report 2. Name and residence of informant and com- plaixdb. 3. Brief discription of offence (i.e. theft murder, etc.) and pro- perty removed if any. 4. Place of occurrence. 5. Name and resioence of accused. 6. Steps taken regarding investigation. Report of informant and complaint. Signature. Designation. —— ^ | First Information Reports should bear an annual ser ial number in each Police Station for each calender year. Each three pages of the register should have the same number and copies, made by the cor bon copying pro cess, should be sent to the Superintendent of police and to the Agency or Bahrain Court as the case may be. I suggest that in the case of Bahrain subjects, until a penal code is made for Bahrain, the police should onlyonly investigate those cases shov/n as cognisable in schedule of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code. They should have nothing to do y/ith civil cases. First In- format on reports should be %Titten by the Office in Charge and in his absence by the Station clerk. Cancellations of Cases . When a case is registered in this way and after in vestigation is found to be maliciously false or false owing to a mistake of law or fact or to be non-cognis- abie or a matter for a civil suit, the first information report with any other papers on the Police Station file of the case should be forwarded to the Superintendent of Police with a report. If the Superintendent of Police is satisfied with this report he should forward it to the Agency Court or in the case of Bahrain subjects to the Commandant for orders of cancellation. Untraced Cases . In cases where the police are unsuecesfui after tak ing all the measures possible, and it is considered ad visable to suspend the investigation, a report, as re quired by Section 173 Cr. F.C. should be prepared by the investigating officer giving the facts of the case which he believes to be correct and the reason for his belief. This report should take the following form:- Poiice Station.. First Information Report No....... dated Date ...a....... 1. Name and address of complainant and informant. 2. Nature of charge or complaint. 3. Details of stolen property if any. 4. Name and address of suspects. 5. Details of any arrests made. 6. Brief description of Police action with reasons for not proceeding further with investigations. Signature of investigating Officer.case file to the Igency courts in the case of British subjects and foreigners and to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government in the case of Bahrain subjects. Should the Superintendent be dissatisfied with the police investigation he should either himself make further enquiries or band the case over to the Inspector 2. A station diary should be kept in the same way as that for the Lines. 3. A register in two parts part 1. For Standing Orders. part 11. For Circular and other Orders. 4. A file of Alans issued by the Bahrain Government. These should be numbered serially and indexed. 5. A correspondence register is proposed for the Lines with the addition of a second part for the receipt and return of processes. At present all processes, civil and criminal are sent to the Police for service. Only warrants in non-cognisable criminal cases or summons in which the Bahrain Government or the Agency is the complainant should be served through the police. On the last day of each month a statement showing the number received, served and remaining of processes /unexecuted should be entered in the daily diary. The process servers at present employed for the service of Civil processes and working under the Police should be transfered to the control of the Bahrain court^ 6. A register to contain the copies of all reports for action not concerning cognisable cases such as:- 1. Prosecutions under section 182 I.P.C. 2. Cases in which security for good behaviour is reauired to be taken. 8. Investigations into accidental deaths of human beings. 7. A cash register as suggested for the Lines with receipt books. 8. A register showing rations received and issued. 9. A register showing in part 1 the names of ail men at the Police Station with columns for the date ofof arrival &amp;nd date of transfer and in part 11, all Government property at the Police Station. 10. Minute book for officers carrying out an in- fori^al inspection. 11. 1 Crime Register. This is one of the most im portant records of the Police Station. It should be divided into two parts. The first should contain detills of crime in the main town under the jurisdiction of the Police station i.e. Manama &lt;and Muh&amp;rraq in which practically all Crimea takes place^ and the second for crime occuring in the smaller vill ages ana towns with separate pages for each. The reg ister for small towns and villages would be numbered serially and under each the following information shown: 1. Rough estimate of population 2. Names of influential persons residing there. 3. The principal tribes from which the inhabitants originate. Entries under each town or villages should be divided into two categories, the first for cases in whddh convictions have been received and the second for cases in which persons resident there are suspected but not either tried or convicted. A suggested form for the register is below. Serial No. F.I.R.

A register of petty offences in two parts, the first to contain offences against the licensing and registration laws for motor drivers and vehicles and the second, offences under Muncipal bye-laws and other petty offences dealt with summarily. M&amp;gister&amp;tes should fix two days a week for trying such offences and persons for trial warned to appear accordingly. Separate registers should be maintained for the Agency and Bahrain courts to be placed before the Magisterates at the time of trial. The order in each case will be entered by the Magisterate and initialled. Tnvestiaations . To assist both supervising and investigating officers an accurate case diary is of importance and is required by section 172 Or. F.C. Tbis diary for which the following form is suggested should conjoin a concise and clear record of the steps taken by the police during the investigation of a case. Police Station No. of case Diary. F#I.R. No Time &amp; date of despatch. ... Date and place of occurrence... from Police Station. Offence. late 8c hour when action was taken. Serial No of report. Record of investigations. Two copies of case diaries should be made by the carbon copying process, one for the officer investigate ing the case and the second to be sent immediately after preparation to the Superintendent of Police. Diaries shoud be brief and statements recorded by the Police should be recorded separately.The number &amp;nd date of each diary should be en tered on the back of the Police Station copy of the First Information Report. When a case is sent for trial the Police Station file of case diaries should be forwarded with the ch&amp;r 6 e sheet -and other connected papers and returned to the Police on completion of the trial. The sheet xL should be of the form shown at page of the report. In all important cases a plan of the scene of the crime must be prepared. I doubt if it would be possible to obtain a man i inhabitants from among the local tadasda with a knowledge of tracking but efforts should be made. Searches should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of sections 102,103 &amp; 164-165 Cr. P.C. Inquests should be carried out by Sub-Inspectors and reports should state the apparent cause of death with a discription of any marks of violence found on the body and the manner in which and weapon or in strument with which such marks appear to have been inflicted. The report should include: 1. Plan of the scene of the death. 2. Inventory of clothing etc., and other articles on the boay. Public opinion has so far prevented post mortem being cjrried out by the State Medical Officers and this must make inquests difficult and cases resulting in death from poisoning impossible to establish. Inquest reports should be forwarded by the Superintendent of police to the Agency court in the case of British subjects and foreigners and to the Commandant in the case of Bahrain subjects.LINES. It The efficient running of police headquarters or Lines is of vital importance and a great deal depends on the appointment of a capable officer in charge 9 Provision has been made in the proposition statement for a Lines clerk of the rank of Head Constable 1st Class who 7/ould be required to deal with all ordinary correspondence and maintain all the lines registers except those concerning Arms, Ammunition, Clothing and Equipment* The following records should be maintained by him in Arabic (l) A- daily diary in the following form i- The entries which should be made in this diary are Policemen of all ranks of both the military and civil forces whether posted at Lines or elsewhere with a statement of the nature of their duty* Such entries should be made immediately on arrival or prior to the departure of officers concerned* ( 2 ) The hour of receipt and despatch of all communi cations,property,cash,rat ions etc. giving a reference in the case of correspondence to the number in the correspondence register# DATE* Serial No* Name of reporter Substance and time of report of report Signature of Lines Officer. Initials of Superintendent of Police (l) The time of arrival and departure on duty of(3) Reports on absentees from roll calls, parades etc. (4) Any other matter the entry of which may be ordered by the Superintendent of Police or Commandant. (5) The opening entry each day should contain details of the number of men present in Lines, sick and on leave. A time should be fixed for the closing of the diary which should be maintained in duplicate by carbon copying process. One copy should remain in the Police Station and the other sent to Superintendent of Police as soon as possible after the diary is closed. (2) A correspondence register in the following form (This should include all correspondence concerning jail). RECEIPTS ISSUES. No. 1 Date of * By whom order * issued letter # etc. 1 Substance of order or letter ITo. Date of Report Letter etc* Substance of Report Letter etc* This register should be maintained in the ordinary way. When an entry is made in the receipt columns the correspon ding despatch columns should be left blank for the reply and vice versa. (3) CASH BOOK . A cash account in the following form should be kept for all monies spent and received by the Lines Officers- S' a &lt;i&gt; H* &amp; W o o IV !25 o 9 c+ fl&gt;| ce &lt;» i? M , ° . I2| O1 4 p^T. ■ ' 77 @ An advance of not more than is. 100/- should be sanctioned. Recoveries should be made from time to time from the office of the Superintendent of Police and the amount balanced at the end of each month and signed after being checked by the Lines Officer. (4) A register in four parts,the first showing the 4 names of all Police Officers attached to the Lines in the following form, separate pages being alio ted for each rank.

Bart 111 should contain a list of menial servants attached to headquarters with details of service and pay. __ * part IV should be the absentee register showing XI all men sick in hospital, under suspension or in the Quarter Guard, on casual leave or long leave or ab sent without leave. (5) The control of the ordering of storing, and issue of rations for both military and civil police must rest with the Lines Officer and the following system is recommended. A register should be maintained by the Lines clerk in two parts as follows •^A^aiaMuAn order book with foil -and countefoil should be kept by the Lines Officer, -all orders being counter signed by the Superintendent of Police. Receiving Officers should be the Officers in charge of Police Stations, Posts, Lines and guards posted away from Lines for a month or more. They should be made responsible for checking the rations received and issuing a receipt and also for their distribution to the men under them. Rations should be issued to receiving officers for a full month anf police men transfered during the month should take their rations with them to their places of transfer. Transfers during the course . of the month should be as far as possible avoided. The ordering of storing and issuing of rations for prisoners should be kept and dealt with separate ly, separate registers being maintained.■f Clothing and Equipment , The Head Constable in charge of clothing and equipment should be required to maintain general registers on the following lines:- (1) A general stock register showing the distribution of all miscellaneous equipment possessed by the Police Force* A separate page should be given to each article and entries should include such items as Beds, Boxes, articles of furniture, hand-cuffs, lathies, cooking utensils, etc. showing the number of each in Line, Police Stations, etc. (2) An equipment stock register for un issued articles of equipment kept in the Lines Store Room. This should include Camel Police equipment, Band equipment and equipment for Foot Police. (8) Stock account of receipts and issues of clothing new and second hand for both Civil and Military Police for which the following form is suggested. :re ce ived;Great:Shirts:Shorts:Jerseys:Socks:Durries:etc * : :Coat : : : : : : These two registers should be maintained in three parts, the first for new clothing received either from the Lines Tailors or manufacturers and for clothing in good condition received from RECEIPTS Date of:From receipt:whom Articles of clothing (No. only) :Sig. of tDeposit or. ISSUES. Date of: To whom: Articles of clothing issue : issued : Signature of Great rShirts: Shorts: Jerseys: Socks: Durr ies: etc$Rec ipient. Coat : : : : : : :men leaving the Police. The second for second hand clothing received for sale or destruction and the third for the complete kits deposited by men on leave, sick in hospital etc. Each part should be balanced monthly under the signature of the Lines Officer. As far as possible each article of clothing should have the month and year of issue stamped on it. Periods of life should also be fixed. The periods of duty at outlying police post and guards will continue to be short and the issues of all clothing and equipment can be carried out in Lines. On the transfer of a member of the Civil Police to Lines, his kit should be inspected by the Superintendent of Police and orders passed for any replacement necessary, ff any article has become unserviceable before the fixed period and no reasonable excuse is offered a fresh issue should be made and a proportion of the cost to be fixed by the Superintendent of Police deducted from the pay of the person concerned. Such a payment order should be entered in the order book kept by the Superintendent of Police. Officers inspecting Police Stations should carry out kit inspections and a list of the replacements required sent to the Lines Officer who should summon the person concerned to Lines when convenient to the Officer in charge of the Police Station. Articles for replacement must be returned to the Clothing Head Constable. Clothing Allowance . I recommend the discontinuance of the practice of paying each man a clothing allowance of Rs.S/- per month m cash to pay for the replacement of great coats, jersies, blankets and durries.These articles last longer than the four i year period for which the majority of men serve and the allowance is tantamount to an increase in pay. UNIFORM. C Iwould suggest the following iacrovements hi the Police uniform:- (1) Buckles of belts should have the constabulary number stamped on them. (2) The type of chapli at present worn is poor. Enquiries should be unde from the dspector General of Police, North West Frontier Province, India, regarding the firm which supplies cbaplies to the Frontier Police. (S) Men should not be required to wear putties during hot weather. Hose tops with roiled socks should be vfcrn. (4) For the cold weather Khaki jersies of the military pattern should be issued and worn outside the shirt. It will be necessary to evolve a suitable uniform to be worn by officers. ARMS and AMMUNITION . Arms . The number of rifles possessed by the Police Force greatly exceeds the number of men and I recommend the sale to the Ordnance Authorities in India of the 175 manufactured m 1912 and 1917 and all unserviceable rifles. The Police and Naturs should be issued with the rifles recently purchased from England. At least/4, .22 Morris tubes should be purchased for minature range firing. Ail the marie 6 ammunition should be destroyed. For the proper control of the issue ofr* qv of ^arnis and ammunition an officer of the rank of Head Constable 1st class is proposed* He should keep the keys of the armoury and magazine during the day and deposit them at night with the Lines Officer. His duties should include the maintenance of all records connected with arms and ammunition, the inspection of rifles after they have been returned, for damage or neglect and for reporting any deficiencies in arms and ammunition returned to the armoury. For these purposes the following registers should be maintained by him: Arms . (1) Hames of men in the Armed Military Police to whome rifles have been issued, with the number of the rifle against each man f s name. Arms for the Armed Military Police should be kept in a separate part of the Armoury. (2) A statement showing the distribution of arms m the Civil Police, i.e. the number of rifles kept at each Police Station, Post and Guard and also Lines. This statement should be signed by the Commandant and a copy kept in the office of the Superintendent of Police. (o) A register for the issue and return of arms of armed part es sent from lines with columns for the date of issue, name of person to whom issued, number of rifles, signature or thumb impression of recipient, date of return and signature of the H&amp;vildar in charge. Ammunition . At present ammunition is kept in the Armoury opened boxes being within easy reach of men -.Mi—■■.3^' *h' .returning rifles after parade and the provision of a separate magazine ±s a necessity f Aimaunition should be divided into a 'Reserve Stock' and 'Expense Stock'. All the permanent issues, i.e. to Police Stations, Posts and Guards should be made from the Reserve Stock at the scale of 20 rounds per rifle. The expense stock should be used purely for training purposes and the quantity allotted should represent the maximum so expended annually. Blank ammunition should be kept with the Expense stock. ^ The following two registers are required: : : Ammunition : Empties rSig.of rRem&amp;rks Date.Detail;Receipt{ issue, balan'ce.receivea.disposed.Balance. S.P. : : : : : : : of : : ; -m - — : x : : : Signature : Bate* Detail. Receipts. Issues. Balances.of Supdt.Police. Remarks. (A) Expense Stock. Part (i) for .SGo rifle and Bart (ii) for .455 revolver and B&amp;rt (iii) for .22 ammunition. (B) Reserve Stock. Bart (i) for .305 rifle and Bart (ii) for .455 revolver ammunition. Transfer of ammunition from the Reserve to the Expense stocK should only t&amp;Ke place with the written sanction of the Superintendent of Police. A check of Arms and ammunition should be carried out monthly by the Superintendent of Police or the Commandant. Range Register . Separate range registers should be maintained for the minature and open range firing on the following lines:-Serial: Date No. : Daily : Name:Consta- rbulary : No. : :score:No.of Details of:Fosaible:obtai:rounds practice :score :-ned :used Initials of L.O. or 0. in.C. Registers should be closed yearly. Separate registers on similar lines should be kept for the Armed Military Police. , At the end of each day’s firing the number of rounds received from the magazine, the number expended and the empties returned and the balance should be shown in the register in red ink. These entries should be signed by the Commanding Officer or Jemadar in charge of the Armed Military Police and initialled by the Nead Constable M&amp;gaz me/iferoldor after he has made the proper entries in the expence stock Register. The records which have been suggested are those which are considered essential for the effective control and check of all activities in Lines. It is probable that additions and alterations may be necessary and de£alied instructions for their maintenance will have to be worked out. SCHOOL . Practically speaking the introduction of any scheme of re-organisation t^ increase the efficiency of the Police depends on the increase of the literacy in all ranks, and a great deal can be done by the establishment of a Lines School. Separate classes should be provided for the two branches of the Force. The attendance of men of the Military Police will offer no difficulty as they will always be present in Lines but greater attention must beTT given to the Civil Police and efforts made to provide every possible opportunity for attending the school. The following subjects should be taught:- 1. Illiterate men in the Civil Police. (a 1 ) Reading and writing and simple arithmetic in Arabic. (b) Roman letters and numerals (c) Elementary law and procedure. (d) General duties especially as regards specific duties on beat, patrol and traffic duty, relations with public, serving of processes, the carrying out of searches, the proper method of descr ibing a person, the various numbers and marks on motor vehicles and how to read the clock (e) Matters of Departmental Discipline. 2. Literate . (a) A more extensive knowledge of law and ! procedure. b) The same as in (d) for illiterate men. c) The maintenance of Police records d) Investigating work e) The same as (e) above. Men of the Armed Military Police will probably be entirely illiterate, all literate recruits and others being required for the Civil Police. Their syllabus should include:- 1. Reading, writing and arithmetic in Arabic. 2. The duties of the Armed Military Police. 3. Elementary Tactics. 4. Musketry, i.e. the mechanics of the rifle and lignt automatics etc. The co-operation of the Director of Education should be sought to provide teachers for Arabic classes which could if necessary take place in the evenings after the Naturs come on Duty. It will undoubtedly be difficult to arrange for the uninterrupted attendance of men of the Civil Police but a start should be made with recruits and men under speci-al training and when theprovision of married quarters enables transfers to be cut down a further advance should be possible. Classes in other subjects should be taken by the Lines officer, Inspectors and Superinten dent^ of Police and the Jemadar for the Military Police. Control of Investigations . The Superintendent of Police should personally maintain a crime register in two parts one for each police station. The following form is suggested:- Yearly: Humber ana date of ;N&lt;ame of :Number and Serial: first Information :investigatingDate of each Ho. : Report and type of -.Officer. :Oase Diary. : offence. : : Brief facts :Orders :passed and .:result of :case. The result of each case should be entered in red ink. Each copy of a First Information Report of Case Diary received from the Police Stations should be scrutinised by the Superintendent of police before entry in the Register and explana tions should be called for at once in the event of delay in commencing investigations, the dele gation of a junior officer to investigate, illegal action of the Police, glaring omissions during an investigation and such like matters. First information Reports, case Diaries and replies to written instructions should be filed together in his office. When the investigation of cases other than petty offences has been completed the charge sheet should be checked by the Inspector before being put into court. He should see that (1)all papers which will form part of the judicial record are attached e.g. injury reports, bail bonds, inventories of property recovered (2) no omissions or defects remain unrectified in the investigation (b) that the identity and previous convictions (if any) of the accused have been properly established and that if the accused is in security for good behaviour, the fact is noted in the file. Inspector should place the file before the Superintendent of Police for his orders as to whether the case should be put into court or withheld for further police action. If the Superintendent of Police decides that the case should be placed in court the investigating officer should place the charge sheet before the Magistrate having jurisdiction together with any case property and he should also produce the accused and prosecution witnesses. Magistrates should take up fresh cases the day they are presented and record as much of the prosecution evidence as they have time for. The investigating officer will be responsible for the production of the accused and case property at all subsequent hearings of the case. 1 Inorder to enable the Police to have accurate information of the result of each case sent for trial a conviction slip in the following form should be attached to the case file:- Name of accused parentage,trib residence occu^i Offence under which qharged date of arrest. .Result of case with Signature of Magistrate.u o These conviction slips should be sent by the Court after completion to the Superintendent of Police who after entering the result in his crime register should pass them on to the Police Station i concerned. In the Police Station entries should be made both in the F.I.R. register and the crime register. TRAFFIC. This work was taken over by the office of the State Engineer only some 6 months ago. It reflects considerable credit on those concerned that the records, which when removed from the Police were apparently in an almost hopeless state of confusion have now been sorted out and are satisfactorily maintained. I have the following remarks 1. The Commandant of Police is the Licensing and Registering Authority of the Bahrain Government, but all the records are maintained by the State Engineer. If the changes suggested in this report are effected the possibility of transfering this work back to the Police should be considered.The Inspector could be made responsible for the maintenance of these records but he would require extra staff. 2. The fee for the driving test (Rs.5/-) is paid after passing the medical examination and the applicant is given a receipt. This receipt is produced at this test and the result marked on it in pencil with the letter P or F usually without signature or date. This marked receipt is the authority on which the license is issued. This is unsatisfactory and the application form should contain a space for the result of the medical examination and driving test, each being filled '• I 4 i ■tuMk&amp;litiiilifer.-L o (£) © * * i is? % : @ in, signed and dated by the officer concerned. 3. Endorsements and suspensions are not dealt with by this office but by the Police. On the conclusion of a case the licence is taken by the Police and the endorsement by the Commandant. No record is kept either by the Police or the State Engineer and it seems that a man has only to lose his licence and apply for a new one for the matter to be forgotten. I consider that licenses for endorsement should be sent by courts to the State Engineer who will ma/&lt;e an entry in such licenses and in the Register of driving licenses and also inform the Police. Licenses suspended should be retained in the State Engineer’s office. All entries of this nature should be in red ink. It is noticed that a number of persons receive free driving licenses and registration who in scy opinion are not entitled to them. Persons not empo-oyed as Government drivers should pay for their driving licences and all persons not issued with State Cars for * registration TRAINING CIVIL POLICE . The training of men of the Bahrain Police in more advanced police work must be increased. Since 1932, the Superintendent of Police and one Havildar have completed courses of training at the Bombay police Training School at Nasik, and one HaviMar is at present under training there. Two h&amp;vildars and six N&amp;iks have been sent for courses of nine months duration with Indian Army Regiments. The result of the MMtraining at the Bombay Police Training School cannot be regarded as particularly satisfactory owing to the failure of men to pass examinations in law and procedure. The difficulty is mainly one of language, all tuition being given and examinations taken in English. I think that there can be no doubt that training could take place in India, as besides the fact that the criminal law and procedure applicable to a large portion of the population of Bahrain is Indian Law, the Code of Criminal Law which is to be evolved for Bahrain will it is hoped be based on Indian Law. All men enlisted as officers should be sent to India for Training and as many as possible of those of the rank of H&amp;vildar 1st Class. When these men have been trained they must be made use of both in the lines school and on the parade ground to teach others, and I suggest that when the Haviidar at present under training at Nasik returns he should be placed in charge of the Lines so as to be available for this purpose. Men sent to India for training should if possible be given tuition in English especially in legal terms before being sent, and periods of training should never be less than 18 months. As many as possible of the Havildars 2nd and brd class considered suitable for promotion to higher rank should be transferred to Lines to attend short refresher courses before being promoted. They should attend the lines school and should be taught parade subjects by the Lines Officer personally. A simple examination should be held at the conclusion of these courses w/hich men should be required to pass before being promoted.MILITARY POLICE. The Officer appointed as Jemadar in charge of the Military Police should, if possible, be sent to an Indian Army Regiment for training. An Officer of the Iraq Levy Corps could probably be procured to visit Bahrain from time to time and train men and non-commissioned officers especially selected for promotion.^ y . f®) jtV The following statement shows the present main items of recurring monthly expenditure compared with similar expenditure if these proposals are ■brought into effect: At Present As proposed. Inspectors Sub-Inspectors 1 Inspector @ Rs.200/- ^ c/ 4 Sub-Inspectors @ i25&gt;- Rs.200/- - Rs.SGO/- 1 Clerk @ Rs.lOG/- 100/- 1 Clerk @ Rs.100/- Rs.100/- 8 H&amp;vildars 1 at Rs.98&gt;- 2 @ Rs.Bi/- 5 @ Rs.40/- 17 H&amp;vildars and Head- Constables 1st Class at Rs.55/- p.m. Rs.412 Rs.935/- 12 Naiks at 35/- Rs.420 22 Balks and Head- Constables 2nd Class at Rs.45/- p.m. Rs.990/- 28 L/Naiks at 30/- s Rs.840 bo L/Naiks and Head Constables 3rd Class at Rs. 36/- p.m. Rs.1,188/- 298 Men at 25/- Rs. .450 238 Men @ Rs.28/- Rs.6,664/- wFr~~ “ Rs.9,222/- 316 Rs.10,677/- Cost of clothing and equipment 1,384/- 775/- Good conduct pay for 75 % of force Rations @ Rs.S&gt;- per 777/- head 2,076/- 1,860/- Rs.13,459/- f t // At present the clothing and equipment of \ */ } ■ / each man costs Rs.36/- per year (clothing allowance) and the value of clothing given free which has been estimated at Rs*!^/- annually for each man. Uniforms and equipment should not cost the Government more than Rs.BG/- yearly for each man and this figure has been taken to estimate the monthly expenditure if the clothing allowance be abolished. The initial expenditure on uniforms for officers may be appreciable but the cost of yearly replacements should not greatly exceed this figure.It is difficult to estimate the future expenditure on training as this will depend on the number of men forthcoming suitable for advanced training and possessing tne required standard of education. The yearly expenditure for the training of a Haviidar at the Nasik school is approximately Rs.3,000/-. The maximum yearly expenditure may be placejd ^ Rs. 10,000/- to include jgt two nen at the Nasik School and the loan of an N.C.O. either from the Indian Army or Iraq Levy Corps to train selected men of the Armed Military Police. The main additional non-recurring expenditure will of course be for buildings and this I am not competent to estimate.x JAIL. I have only had time to make a brief inspection of the Jail and my remarks are as follows:- There are no Jail Orders. The control of the jail rests with the Lines Clerk who deals with releases and Havildar Nadir Khan who responsible both for the storing of prisoners 1 clothes and other belongings and the L/N in charge of the Guard for the distribution of work for those sentenced to rigorous imprison ment. Release orders are usually signed by the Adviser in the Registers maintained by the Lines Clerk. AH criminals sentenced to terms of imprison ment greater than one year are sent to Jidda Islan. At present there are 12 at Jidda and 40 in the Fort Jail. At the Fort there are 10 cells each measuring lif feet by 9 feet. Rigorous imprisonment consists of cleaning stables of horses and camels, working in gardens, carrying policemen^ kits etc. No work is given to ploners sentenced to simple impisonment. There are no Jail industries. Prisoners sentenced to rigorous impisonment wear leg irons. Women prisoners are kept in two cells which form part of a married quarter outside the fort. There are no regular medical inspections. Remissions are earned at the rate of 3 days per month in the case of pisoners sentenced to more than 6 months 1 imprisonment. Visitors are said to be allowed with the written sanction of the Commandant.' ^ ' * * kli I 1 / Food is cooked by the Lines Gifeazk who are helped by prisoners. Meals appeared satisfactory and a great deal better than that supplied to persons in the Police lock up. A register of rations issued to prisoners is kept and is apparently never checked. The jail guard consists of one section which also provides escorts. The keys of cells are kept with the N.C.O. day and night. Prisoners are given suits of jail clothes and their own clothes stored in the jail godown. Valuables are kept at the Police station. Proper inventories of prisoners 1 effects are not drawn up and signed by the prisoners and Havildar in charge. Records are kept by the Lines Clerk. Separate files are kept of warrants of commitment received from Agency and Bahrain Courts. Remissions and release orders are entered in these warrants. Separate registers for British subjects and foreigners are also kept showing the date of entry and release of the prisoners, the type of imprisonment they have been sentenced to and the brief facts of the crime for which they were sentenced.I have no time to zmke detailed recommenda tions for the improvement of the iranagement of the Jail but the following points which concern the police are of primary importance. (1) No one in Lines knew who was in charge of the Jail and it is essential that there should be an officer to discharge this important function. It may be poss ible to eventuaXly procure suft icent funds to build a separate Jail for all short term prisoners with judicial lock-up and run by a separate Jail staff. For the present, however, control of the Jail must rest with the Police and the Lines Officer should be appointed as officer- in-charge. His responsiblities should include the maintenance of records, constant inspection and in particular the check of prisoners before they are locked up for the night. The keys should rema in with him throughout the night and not as at present with a junior N.C.O. (2) Detailed instructions should be drawn up for the running of the Jail to cover the following points.(a) Responsibilities of the Officer -in-Charge and the Haviidar in charge of the escorts,records, remission of sentences, jail/^y^fefeSS ^ ae method of dealing with complaints, restriction of visitors, inspection by the State Medical Officer, custody of prisoners 1 property etc. (3) The Police Station concerned should be notified of the release of all prisoners sentenced for criminal offences.CONCLUSION- The recommendations which have been made in this report may in some respects appear too ambitious, but I am certain that if a definite plan of action is formulated and improvements effected by stages, it will be possible to produce in Bahrain an efficient Police Force which would have the confidence of the public. Bahrain is at present going through a period of tremendous change and enormous strides have been made in every branch of the administration. The people themselves are becoming more politically minded and increasingly interested in the Government of therr own country, it is of vital importance that the police which forms one of the most important branches of the administration should not be left behind in the progress which is being made. In the short time at my disposal it has been impossible to deal with every point noted during my prepes&amp;ls inspection and my proposals only deal with what are in my view the most important and basic requirements. It is possible that local conditions may require the alteration of some of the recommendations before they can be put into effect.Confidential D*0* No* C/432 Dated the 24th £ ay 1940 I enclose with this letter three copies of Hallows* Report on the Bahrain Police and his recommendations for the overhaul and re-organisation of the Force* I am writing demi-officially as I can discuss the matter more freely in this form* I am afraid the Report has been delayed, but Hallows only had about a month for his investigations while the framing of proposals, their discussion with me, their amendment in several cases and their casting in final form naturally took some time longer* Sven the typing of a Report of this length occupied practically every typewriter in this office for &amp; week, outside office hours* 2 * As I have said the recommendations for re-organisation have been discussed by Hallows and myself and it follows that I shall have no very long comments to make on the details* Nor indeed do 1 propose to waste time bemoaning the lack of routine efficiency in the Police disclosed by Hallows* Report* We must remember the difficulties there have been in creating a local Force at all, particularly during a period of rapid expansion of all the Bahrain Government* s administrative functions, and be thankful that Ch &lt;nce has given us this opportunity of diagnosing its present internal malady and of prescribing a cure. .^ 'x\ 3 , It might be deduced from Part II of this Report that the Bahrain Police are in such a bad way that they can only be brought to a reasonable state of efficiency by appointing a British Police Officer to take charge of them for at least five years. This however I do not feel is true; and judging by A The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel C* G* Prior, C*I*a;*, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buahire*by pf^st experience it would be almost impossible to make the Shaikhs agree willingly to such a proposal. As you are aware they have been congratulated by Kings, Admirals, Ambassadors and lesser men on the appearance of their Police; in spite of the deficiencies of the Police now so clearly disclosed there is remarkably little crime in these Islands? and it can be argued that with the exception of their failure to perform their duties under the Defence Scheme with real efficiency, the Bahrain Police have at least during the last few years carried out, somehow or other, the task required of them. Thus the Shaikhs would, I am convinced, resent the suggestion that thsir Police are so inefficient that they need to be pulled together by a British Police Officer. They cannot really understand our complaint© that police cases sent the Agency Courts are not properly investigated and are never properly put before the Courts. And it is significant that when I told them that we proposed to lend the services of Hallows to make a critical examination of the whole Police organisation, their immediate reaction was to say that they hoped he would not put forward proposals based r-oo closely on Indian theory and practice, which they thought were un suitable in Bahrain. Then there is another im^tant gCjtot* When I came here I found that Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammad had been cent for training to Nasik with the definite under taking from my predecessor (whether or not approved by the Political Resident I am unable to say) that he was to return here to take charge of the Police* I know how deeply he felt when the proposal was mooted two arci a half years ago to introduce a British Police Officer, and I know that if this proposal were now put into effect he would throw his hand in# It may be argued that this is a matter of little importance since Shaikh Khalifah himself is not a brilliant Police Officer /-Officer with years of service behind him. But I think it would be a great pity, for his appointment to his present post has really done a good deal to improve the prestige of the Police in general, and I think there is little hope of popularising service in the Police for men of better c lass unless they are headed by one of the AX Khalifah Family. Khalifah himself is very keen, has picked up a very fair amount of knowledge at Hasik, and has co-operated whole-heartedly with Hallows in the belief that he himself will b e enabled to carry out reforms which he fully recognises are needed in the Police organisation. He has too the right idea about the Agency (to put it no more precisely). Pinally we must recognise that the pros pects of obtaining a first-class young officer of the Indian Police at the present juncture are remote in xhe extreme. 4 . It follows therefore that while the plan of re-organi sation does nor by any means exclude the possibility of employing a British Police Officer it h£S been worked out in such a way that it should be possible to put it into effect over a period of two or three years and to expect a fair standard of efficiency without employing such an officer. The strength proposed for the various ranks for both parts of the force has been worked out with strict regard to what we think is the minimum force required for normal peace-time duties in Bahi*ain and it does not provide (jvU f J&gt; for war-time requirements such as uhe special force to be recruited for protection work at the Oil Field and Refinery. The total strength inract shows a reduction on the present figure though the total cost of the force is very much the same as it is at the moment, mainly because of the very con siderable increase in the H.C.O. ranks. In brief the object has been to prepare for a better educated and far more highly trained A— 4 © trained force (both for civil and semi-military duties), offering a career which should be attractive to a better type of local resident. It is I think absolutely essential that the force should be composed almost exclusively of local people, however w awkward” they may be to train, if we are to avoid the difficulties and dangers of the past which followed the recruitment of foreigners# 5# I do not think I need say a great deal more# The re-organisation plan is self-contained even though it will obviously reauire time to put it into complete effect# I have been in some doubt whether I should show this Report to Belgrave before sending it to you, in order to give him an opportunity of expressing his views, but it seemed desirable to obtain in the first instance your general approval to the scheme that is set out* If you do approve, I think it is essential to call on the Bahrain Government to take immediate action towards implementing it while we still have an ex- Police Officer here as Assistant Political Agent. Presumably Hallows will be In Bahrain for another year in accordance with the promise given when he was first appointed to this Agency and it should be possible for him, once he has passed his Preliminary Arabic - as I think, he can now do, to d evote a certain amount of time to watching, advising and guiding the preliminary stages of the re-organisation. He is on the best of terms with Shaikh Khalifah and is well liked by Belgrave, so there is no need to anticipate any friction# Yours sincerely,Confidential. D.0.HO.358-S. ]. ,\J\ - ;; JUN. 19« The Residency, Buahire, the 1st June, 1940* l/ 6 ^ ^ lt&gt;g Thank you for your demi-official letter jso.C/432 of 24th May 1940 and Hallows* very interesting and able report, i agree generally with the proposals, but as suggested in paragraph 3 of your letter 1 doubt if the deficiencies of the Police are really so very serious. The deficiencies disclosed would probably be found in 80 per cent of Indian States but unlike most Indian States the Bahrain Police usually 'get their man'. The fact is of course that the place is so small, and the charge so insignia fieant, that they would carry on probably quite as well without any organization whatever, in fact Kuwait, which is in some ways better run than Bahrain, has no police organiza tion that I know of beyond supplying a few men with uniform S 2. I agree, however, that something should be done and I will take the last paragraph of your letter first. The Bahrain Government should certainly be asked to take immediate action towards implementing the proposals, and, if Hallows can be spared, I see no objection to his giving them what help he can in its re-organization. 3. I think you should try and bring home to the Shaikhs the fact that because they have a body of men who form fours and stand on the pier and welcome strangers, that they have not yet got an efficient police force and that there are still higher flights for them to aim at. It may be difficult to get this idea over, in fact it certainly will, but a few /selected H.Weightman Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain.selected facts pressed home once a fortnight should produce some effect in the long run, particularly if Shaikh Khalifa bin Mohammad can co-operate in pointing them out. 4 # x will run over the points that occurred to me. (a) Officers . The Force is very short of men of the officer class, and this is one of the reasons why service in the Police has been so unattractive. Men who were intelligent havildars ten years ago are still havildars, and no thing could be more discouraging. 1 welcome the proposals to the increase/commissioned ranks. (*0 N ature . * agree that the naturs should be retained. They suit these places, and provide employment for a type of man who is politically valuable. to) 1 do not like all these Indian ranks, it would be better to introduce something on the Egyptian lines, and call them Shawish and Bash-Shawish, rather than Kaiks, Jemadars etc. This is the sort of thing that unfriendly Arabs take hold of• (a) Belgrave^ honorarium , i wondered why Belgrave clung so zealously to the police and 1 find there are two hundred reasons a month for it t This makes one hesitate to recommend anythisg for Hallows, hut 1 think that if he xs going to work seriously at them it is only reasonable that they should give him something, it could be considered later• (e) i do not think the enrolment of recruits four times a year will be a success.

(g) The State Band . As a rule the smaller the State the larger the band and they will probably cry if you try and take their band away, if they press strongly for its retention, i should be inclined to let it stay. After all Bahrain is a wealthy State. 5. We should be under no delusion that the errors and amissions disclosed will not be remedied unless there is constant supervision by a British officer. I am surprised to find that Hallows is likely to find time for it, as even if he passes his Preliminary there are other worlds for him to conquer after that, but if he can be made available without detriment to the work of the post I have no objection provided it is understood that no part of his duties falls upon the Publicity Officer. lours sincerely..yff Confidentlai D*0* llo, C/463-4/4 Dated the 5th June ld40* V A As I Informed you about a fortnight ago I sent Hallows* Report on the Police to the Political Resident so that he could see it and say whether he agreed generally with the recommendations that were made for the re-organi- sation before we passed the report to you* I now send you herewith two copies of the report* 2* I am sure you will appreciate the fact that Part II of this report has been written in no spirit of and that the difficulties in recruiting a local police force at all have-been fully realised. At the same time this part of the report does disclose a large number of deficiencies which ought to be made good with the least possible delay. The Political Resident has instructed me to send this report to the Bahrain Government and to urge you to take immediate action towards implementing the proposals made. As you will see these proposals involve very radical re-organisation and it is apparent that it must take some considerable time to put them into full effect, particularly as they involve the selection of promising young men for ^ intensive training in order to fit them to hold officer posts in the Police. 3* The object in view in framing these proposals has been to provide for the creation of an efficient force, well-disciplined, self-reliant, and ready and able to meet all normal requirements Without involving the Bahrain Government in any increased expenditure. It may be that you /- C# Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq*, C»B*E*, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, o | P|PpiqnmMppf N '' ..' .urJEik- A Bahrain#you will see some substantial objection to some of the pro posals made and if so I should be grateful if you would dis cuss these points with me at as early a moment as possible* You will also no doubt wish to have some discussion with His Highness and the senior Shaikhs* and should they be in any doubt as to the urgent need for a thorough overhaul I shall be grateful if you will inform me so that I may have an opportunity of impressing upon them the imperative necessity of adopting a plan of re-organisation of the nature proposed. 4 * I do not attempt to conceal from myself the fact that such a re-organisation will be extremely difficult to ffect* The tightening of discipline and closure of loop-holes for graft must naturally produce fairly violent reactions from those affected, but there can be little doubt that in the end it will result in 4 superior esprit de corps, self- respect and efficiency* A vast deal of the work involved will of course fall on the shoulders of Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammad and in view of his lack of experience and none too complete training it is fairly clear that he Wpiuld need constant guidance, advice and help. Hallows has asked me to assure you that he is more than ready to give all the assistance he possibly can and I suggest that he and Shaikh Khalifah should meet weekly in order to go over the re-organisation work that has been done and in order that Hallows, who is a fully trained and very competent Police Officer, may show Khalifah actually in the Lines, Police Station or Out-posts exactly how things should be done. I suggest too that it would be good for Khalffah and useful generally if he made out a bi-monthly progress report, of which you will perhaps be good enough to let me have a copy.j realise it will be a labour for him but it should help v; ■ / him a great deal to make out his omi perxouieal reviews. They will, amongst other things, sbrve to draw his attention to a number of points which may not have been dealt with adequately or which may have escaped his'attention. 5* I think I should quote on or two paragraphs from the Political Resident’s letter to me. These are as follows s- n ( a ) Officers . The Force is very short of men of the officer class, and this is one of the reasons why s rvice in the Police has been so unattractive. Men who w re intelli gent havildars ten years ago are still navildars, and nothing could be more discouraging. I welcome the proposals to increase the commissioned ranks. ”( b ) Arturs .

In /- i'MvIn regard to the last extract, with which I persona,lly entirely agree, it will of course be necessary to guide Khali fah in the way in which he imposes punishments, ror instance I think it is very wrong for Policemen who commit ordinczry crimes such as theft to be punished departmental!^• As is ^ done elsewhere they should be punished by the Courts. Also 1 fines are not a particularly good form of punishment o.nd certainly semi-public beatings are not. 6. I hope it will be possible in the near future to make some preliminary selection of promising youths for training for the officer ranks. When a provisional selection has been made it is obvious enough that these particular men should undergo an inensive course in English to ensure that they are in a position to obtain the fullest possible oenefit from their training in India. I imagine that this can be fixed up with Vallance. Yours sincerely.ConfldenU-aX D«0» Ko.

Irymple Bclgruvs, Esq#, C#B«E* ? Advisor to the Bahrain Government,D.O. No. A. Bahrain, July 25, 1940. V \\ /V- \ Dear Weightman, With reference to your D.O. C/558-4/4 dated 6th July 1940 and C/463-4/4 dated 5th June 1940* - ir °\ I discussed Hallows’s report on the police with Shaikhs Abdullah and Sulman. I did not go into all the details regarding accounts and printed forms and recommendations affecting only the interior administration because these matters are hardly within their province though they did net suggest that the whole report should be put into Arabic, but this is a big job and not, I think, really necessary* 2« The most important proposal in the report is the reorganisation of the police force into two parts, civil and military police, which is a return to the arrangement which existed in the time of the Levy Corps* Under normal conditions I think this division would be an improvement but neither I nor the Shaikhs think it advisable to make this change immediately and the Shaikhs are reluctant at the moment to do anything which would appear to reduce the number of military police* I am however pre paring the way for this change by picking out certain N.CoOs and men and detailing them exclusively for civil police work such as traffic control etc and Manamah police station duties* They will still have to be based on the Tort because we have no available building for a residential police station and it may be some time before such a building cancan be prepared* as you know one of our greatest difficulties is the lack of men to be trained as officers, we have at present only Abdulkarim bin Haj Salman who, when he finishes his course at Nask, will be put in charge of either Muharraq or Manamah police station. I have asked the Shaikhs to help me to find some more suitable young men for taming. They think that some of the younger and junior Khalifah shaikhs might be persuaded to work, but they would require trainings 3* I am strongly in favour of retaining the naturs* Their value is evident from the small number of thefts committed in the areas for which they are responsible. The naturs are now being drilled and men who are physically unfit are being weeded out. They are being taught to shoot and they form a valuable unit in case of emergency. Apart from their normal duties they are useful for obtaining information as they mix freely with the public, partly because they live in their own houses. 4. The report suggests more police organisation in Muharraq. In the past Muharraq was in charge of an Amir, either a member of the Ruling Family or a protege of the Ruling Family. Since the dismissal of the last Amir the post has not been filled* Since most of the Ruling Family live in Muharraq it was considered politic to allow the control of the town to remain in the hands of an Amir with a force of Naturs. It is only recently that a police post was set up at Muharraq. Conditions have changed and-3- and will change still more when the bridge connects the two towns and I agree that it is desirable to have a regular police station there in charge of a sub-inspectoro 5 0 The report recommends abolishing the horse section and the band and closing down the post at Hawar. Neither the Shaikhs nor I agree that the horse section is useless, patrolling was not given up, the section takes its turn with the camel section in patrolling the coasts. There are innumerable villages far distant from roads which cannot be reached by cars. The Shaikhs take a personal interest in the horse section and see no necessity for giving it up or for doing away with the band. I think it should be remembered that the police do belong to the , Shaikh and if he likes to have a band and a mounted ^ section there is no reason why he should not retain them. The horses, and the camels too, are provided from Shaikh Hamad’s stables. The police at Hawar were relieved by naturs, personally I think the naturs could be reduced to about half a dozen, but the Shaikhs do not agree with this opinion under present conditions. If our quarrel with Q,atar was settled the need for a garrison at Eawar would not exist. 6. The need for better police station buildings is evident to me hut not quite so evident to the Shaikhs who compare present conditions to those a few years ago when Manamah and Hedd police stations were in two shops in the bazaars and prisoners were kept 'rft’the amir’s office. The present Manamah police station is the third building that has been used in * w .4. fMOTTHtMli ■mHbin thirteen years and each move has been to improved quarters. Its situation is admirable but the build ing was not built as a police station. It is dif ficult to adapt existing buildings and expensive to obtain sites and build new buildings in the centre of the town. The customs house and police and naturs rooms in Muharraq are of doubtful ownership. Part if not all of the building is claimed by Shaikh Isa ! s widow, it is for this reason that the central rooms are not available as police quarters. I am not sure that married quarters in town police stations would be practicable in Manamah and Muharraq. The Shaikhs suggest postponing consideration of any more new buildings until next year as there is no provision for new police stations in the Budget. Living condi tions in the Fort have been very greatly improved during the last two or three years during which the Fort has almost been rebuilt and the police have large airy barrack rooms, baths, sanitation, a proper kitchen and mess hall in place of low dark mud and stone rooms with crumbling walls and dangerous roofs. 7. The report recommends the sale of surplus rifles to the Indian Ordnance. This suggestion was not well received by the Shaikhs who pointed out to me that in the case of emergency it should be possible to provide arms and ammunition for all their personal retainers who would form a sort of body guard to the Shaikhs houses. We certainly need a good armourer but the one who was recommended by the Government of India demanded pay which appeared out of all proportion. The new armoury has been built and is now in use. 8. We all agree that more educatei men are needed-5- needed in the force and more men suitable as officers though the Shaikhs do not agree that blacks even of slave ancestry are regarded locally as persons unsuited to hold authority. They point out that elsewhere men of this type have risen to influential positions. We do not like the presence of Indian N.C.Os but with one exception the Indians we have are purely instructors and have no hand in the organisation of the police force. On the whole, however, it might be in peace time, to obtain Iraqi instructors, but at present I think this would not be possible. 9. Regarding the points mentioned in your two letters. I have asked Shaikh Khalifah to make periodi cal reports on progress. He has had several talks with Hallows and we should be glad of his help and advice when he returns. Recruiting at regular intervals is impossible as the supply of men is affected by local conditions such as the diving season. There are com ments on punishmentsJ as you know I go to the Fort on five mornings in the week and once or twice in the afternoons and I always attend orderly room. The punish ments which have been given by Shaikh Khalifah were given with my knowledge and in the case of all serious matters after previous discussion. I do not think there has been any injustice. It is difficult to devise punish ments which are effective other than fines though I quite agree that fines are undesirable. If a policeman^he is beaten in private. In certain punishments loss of pay is automatic, if a men is sentenced to cells he draws no pay during his confinement. 10. A number of the suggestions in the report have been acted upon and others will be adopted as soon-L 0 soon as possible but with the present staff it is difficult to make a quantity of changes hurriedly. In the report there are suggestions for bringing into use between forty and fifty new government forms, registers and ledgers. We have already started on some of these but it will take sometime before we can train staff to use the forms and documents which are considered necessary. The clerical staff of the police force is at present incapable of dealing with the work on the new lines but I am arranging to obtain more competent clerks. Some of the N.C.Os and men are being given lessons in conjunction with the education department. Yours sincerely H. Weightman.

In the first place, in view of the attitude which the into Arabic so that they can have a clearer perception of the necessity for reorganisation and of what this will involve* I am therefore arranging to have the major part of the second section of the Report and most too of Part III translated into Arabic, and I will send you copies for the Shaikhs when this has been done* 3* As you say the most important proposal is the re organisation of the Force into two parts, civil and military police. .But I cannot agree that this fundamental change can safely be postponed. Both Hallows and I feel very definitely that there can be no real progress In reorganisation until the separation of the civil polio© from the military police has boon effected. Possibly the main reason for this sepa ration was not emphasised sufficiently strongly in the Report, namely that men of the type available for the ran!: and file of the Force cannot learn to bo both soldiers and policemen. I doubt if even educated and intelligent men could learn both tasks adequately, for in both branches there is so much for them to learn* Indeed efficient schedules of training can scarcely be drawn up until the separation has boon made* Xt night perhaps be well to explain to the Shaikhs that the separation would not in fact diminish the number of nan capable of using arms in an emergency, for obviously both the civil police end the naturs as well as Shaikhs appear to have taken, 1 * now inclined to think that considerable portions of Hallows* ‘Report should be translated G. Dalrvmule Itelrrave ABso . .0 A . - . Advis e r,Bahrain the/the military police would be trained in the use of tlie rifle, and as you v/ill see on page 56 of the Report the suggestion has been made that schemes for the mobilisation of all available men in emergencies should be worked out and practised. I recommend therefore most strongly that urgent steps be taken to prepare lists of men best quali fied for military or for civil duties as a first step towards the separation* 4. Secondly I doubt if much progress can be made if it is left to the Shaikhs to find young men of the Ruling Family to fill the police officers* posts. The young bloods of the A1 Khalifah Family are not noted for their affection for hard work and I should anticipate the most horrible difficulties in the future in regard both to discipline and promotion if they are to be the principal source from which the officer ranks are to be filled. I do not for a moment deny the difficulties there will be in finding suitable young men but I suggest that these diffi culties could be minimised to some extent by a publicity campaign to popularise the Police Service and to explain that in the future the Police will offer an honourable and well-paid career to young men of intelligence and initiative. Vallance ought to be able to help quite a lot in this respect and he certainly ought to keep his eyes open for suitable young men in the Final Stage School who could be selected for training in India in either civil or military duties. 5. I note youx* remarks about the horse section and the band and if the Shaikhs are anxious to retain these two units I certainly do not propose to press them to abolish them. I trust however that they fullsr realise that they are/-are expensive non-essentials and that if they are retained the reorganised force is hound to cost considerably more than the existing charge against the budget. 6 . 1 now come to the question of buildings. I am par ticularly sorry that the Shaikhs are so short-sighted about this question for it is obvious that the civil police cannot be fully efficient and that the Service as a whole cannot be effective so long as buildings are inadequate. It is of course a fact that there is ho budget provision this year for new buildings, but there is not so much of this year left to go now and it is clear that decisions must be taken in the very near future in regard to a minimum programme of essential work for next year so that plans can be drawn and estimates framed in readiness for inclu sion in your next year *s budget. It seems to me that the two immediate essentials are the police stations in Manama and Muharraq. I fully appreciate the difficulty of pro viding married quarters in Manama police station but per haps the following would serve as a basis on which to examine the problem. Obviously enough the Officer-in-charge should have married quarters and also the police station clerks and investigating head-constables. For the cons tables posted to the Manama police station it would pro bably be sufficient to ear-mark a number of married quar ters in the Lines and to allow married men attached to the station to take it in turn to spend nights in those quarters, the balance together with the unmarried cons tables being accommodated in a barrack room at the police station. This is of course not ideal but is probably as much as can be done in the immediate future. Even t6 pro vide the few married quarters thus required at the station may involve the removal of the Rest House. An alternative, which/-2/— - 4 \ which will probably not appeal, is to shift the entire station to the building now known as 'Packer’s transient quarters* which I gather His Highness is buying from Yusuf Kanoo. As for Muharraq, in view of the doubtful ownership of the building at present used and its total unsuitability, X suggest that the bull should be taken by the horns, c^nd a complete plan made for the construction of a new police station, with the necessary married quarters, somewhere near the Boys’ School* Muharraq town is fortunately fairly compact and there is thus no serious objection to the selec tion of a site in the area suggested. If this were done Hedd could be regarded as an cutpost of Huharraq and a certain number of married quarters provided at Muharraq for married constables detailed (by rotation) to Hedd. I do most earnestly recommend that careful consideration be given to these proposals, for efficiency in civil police work cannot be expected unless the personnel are posted to the respective police stations for periods of one year at the minimum, and this in turn is impossible without adequate buildings, including some married quarters. Should pucca married quarters for constables at Muharraq make the esti mates too high the construction of really good baresties as a temporary expedient might be considered. 7. A good many of the recommendations in Hallows’ Report naturally involve a long term programme of reorga nisation but I have been examining with him those recommenda tions-which wo think could be introduced in the immediate future and X list these below 1. The separation of the military police from the civil police (see paragraph 3 above).- 5 - £ # The establishment of a Lines School. 5* The establishment of proper police control at Muharraq. A: 0 The appointment of Ab3.ul Earim as Lines Officer on his return (v;e both think: that he should be posted to this job in the first place). 5. The establishment of a proper office for the Superintendent of Police and the issue of ins tructions for tho distribution of work and parti cularly for the disposal of accounts. 6 . Framing of schemes for the mobilisation of all available men in emergencies. 7. The sanctioning of permanent advances of money for police stations. 8 . The issue of orders for the submission of special reports (of. pages 56 and 57). 9. Framing of schedules of training - both military and civil. 10, Commencement of regular inspections with written reports. 11. Preparation of registers and foms so that instruction in their use can begin. 13, Opening of the Superintendent of Policed crime register. 15. Preparation of instructions for the proper management and control of the jail and the definition of the responsibilities of all concerned. 8 . •Regarding other minor points. (a) It is agreed that the nature are of value and should be retained, but it is suggested that their musketry course should be the same as tiiat for the civil police and that the same records should be kept. (b) Surplus rifles. As soon as we got the Local Volunteer Defence Force going properly I propose to ask for an armourer to bo sent down from Shaibah and I think we might arrange for him to examine your arms, to effect necessary repairs and to advise which are definitely unfit for service. Even the Shaikhs would presumably /-iDresuraably not wish to keep weapons which will not shoot * (o) About negroes of slave origin. The Shaikhs are of course right in theory but we should not forget that we are pretty thorough snobs in Bahrain l These men could be best employed in the military police. 9 # I am afraid this is a very long letter but you will realise it is meant mainly for the Shaikhs whose complacency and self-satisfaction at times gives me cold shivers.

No. C/437-16/SP Bahrain, March 30, 1941. Dear Alban, With reference to your enquiry about changes in the State Police resulting from Hallows^ report, we have carried out many but not all of his recom mendations * 2. The division of the force into civil and 1 military police has been begun, first the police working on civil duties in Manamah were separated and later those in Muharraq and Hedd. This arrange ment is proving satisfactory but it is impossible at present to divide the force further. At the begin ning of the war all police leave was stopped. There were then a number of men due for leave. A few months ago when the strength of the special police was completed and they took over all the duties in the oil fields etc. the granting of leave was resumed. In the meantime the number of men w r ho were overdue leave had become very large. At present about 80 men are on leave and about 20 are ill and this number of men will continue to be on leave for the next four or five months after wdiich the leave position wall become normal. The men who are on leave are in Bahrain and, in case of emergency, can be called up at a day r s notice. 3. The civil police, when available for parades are being given instruction in special duties which j were recommended such as lathi drill. A police school:.S2&amp; 111 I I I III ll' It -2- school at the Port is providing simple instruction for N.G.Os and men in reading and v/riting. 4. Naturs are 'being trained in the use of arms and squad drill. Many of the men provided by the State for the special police force at Awali were naturs w r ho had received some training at the Port. At present there is always one section of naturs undergoing training with the police and by degrees the whole natur force will become efficient in the use of weapons. In the past the rifle in the poses- sion of a natur was used more as an outward and visible sign of authority than as a weapon. 5. One of the senior N.O.Os is posted at Muharraq but when we have another Sub-Inspector he will be stationed at Muharraq and will be in charge of that island. Abdulkarim son of the late Haj Sulman who was for many years Superintendent of Police lately returned from India after li years at the Police School at Nasik. He was appointed Sub-Inspector of Police and is in charge of the Manamah Police Station as v/ell as carrying out certain duties at the&gt; Port. He deals with all criminal work, prosecutions, traffic and harbour duties. The clerical staff of the police station has been increased and the building enlarged by the addition of a large office and record room. 6. A new police station has been made available in Muharraq in a building belonging to His Highness adjacent to His Highness 1 s Muharraq house. It is well situated in the centre of the town. The naturs continue to occupy the building at the pier.7. The staff at the Port has been increased hy the addition of two Arab clerks and all files, re cords etc,, are now being kept, in Arabic, in the manner suggested by Hallows. Some of the N.C.Os permanently attached to headquarters have been put in charge of rations, stores etc. , etc. , and are keeping | records and ledgers as suggested. Hallows report recommends the adoption of nearly fifty new govern ment forms, registers and accounts for the police force, on the lines of Indian police. Many of these are connected with police station work. Those necessary for the cases produced at the Agency courts are now in use and certain forms are being used by the police when prosecuting in the Bahrain courts. Actually the number of criminal cases produced before the Bahrain courts is very small and most of them are of a minor nature. I should like to know whether the police court work in the Agency courts is proceeding satis factorily. The suggestion regarding records to be I kept by the Superintendent of Police has been adopted | and he is authorised to inflict punishments according to the scale suggested. A new office has been built at the Port and a telephone installed in the house of the Superintendent of Police at Busaitin. 8. The machine gun section is having regular training and practice. Only of the guns have been left with the police. The other B© guns are still on loan to the Defence Officer. It was understood when these were borrowed that the military authorities were providing the necessary weapons for the defence of the \ oiloil field and as soon as new guns arrived the ones 'belonging to the State would he returned. It is fully appreciated that these guns are being used for the defence of Bahrain but if they are to be retained by the Defence Officer for the duration of the war I think the Bahrain government should be informed. Would it be possible for you to enquire from Iraq, whether there is any prospect of machine guns being provided for Bahrain? 9. It has not been possible to make married quarters at the Manamah police station nor do I think that this suggestion is practicable. No men would wish to keep their families in the vicinity of the police station. The senior N.C.Os and the Sub-Inspector all own houses of their own and their families live in them. I think there is a great difference in the method of living in Bahrain and in India. Here a man of any position owns his own house and would not wish to keep his family elsewhere. Most of the police who have married quarters in the lines send their families out of the lines when they go on leave or on post duty. The wuves go home to their parents houses. New married lines are being built at the Port to replace the very unsatisfactory and insanitary old huts which existed previously. 10. Since Hallows* report was written we have built a little police post between Door and Jaw which is occupied by the camel section. This section is divided into two parts and one half is always patrolling the coast from south of the refinery to Ras-al-Barr. The chief duty of the patrol is to prevent Qattar immigrants landing in Bahrain. The horse section is also divided into two parts with headquarters at Budeya from w'here they V 1they patrol the coast and also the inland country mo^st of which is not accessible to cars. The presence of the police in this neighbourhood has had a salutory effect on some of the villages where in the past inces sant quarrels took place, the police also obtain useful information from their contract with the distant villages which used only to be visited at rare intervals. The public now report cases to the police patrols when in the past they would not have troubled to come into Manama for the sake of doing so. 11. Regarding any suggestions for the use of the Assistant Political Agent. I know that he is busy and would have little time to spare but if he could help us to compose a very simple code of police regulations and standing orders it w r ould be of great assistance. This would eventually have to be in Arabic because all the police forms, records etc., are now kept in Arabic with the the exception of some of those which are required by the Agency court. As j^ou know for a long time I have been advocating the adoption of the Sudan Penal Code in the Bahrain Court, with some modifications. If we could produce a Police Regulations to use with it which incorporated some of the points from the Sudan Criminal Procedure Code it would I think be sufficient for the requirements of the Bahrain Courts whose procedure is simpler than that of the Agency Courts. The work of the court in criminal cases is very closely connected with the police work and I think therefore it would be possible to compose one code book which could be used both by the police and the court. Bahrain is too small a placeplace and the amount of criminal work is too little to necessitate the use of a regular Criminal Proce dure Code and also elaborate police regulations in the local courts.

Alooka was not released on the date on which he should have been released owing to an error. I saw him myself in jail a few days before the date on which his sentence should have expired. He asked for remission and I told him that it would not be granted. The remission would have amounted to about 72 days. On the following morning I informed the clerk that Alooka was not to be given the remission which he had earned. He was kept in custody, wrongly, for an additional 19 days. He has now been arrested again. It appears that he stole a coat from one of the people attending the Friday mosque while the owner was washing at the mosque well. Alooka is an habitual thief and a troublesome prisoner, he is a foreign subject, a Persian, and I think he would be a suitable case for repatriation provided that he was warned that he would be severely dealt with if he returned to Bahrain. I have sent in a list of his previous convic tions v/ith my No f 550-9 dated 10th April. Yours sincerely, Major R.G.E.W.Alban, O.B.E., H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.

The fact is that the above individual who is under the jurisdiction of this Agency has been impri soned for 19 days by the State, without any order by a Magistrate, and without committing any offence. In India such offences by Prison Subordinates are very severely lealt with and it appears that the individual responsible is the Jail Clerk. If such an error can occur once it can obviously have occursed before and there must be something wrong with the Jail staff if such things can occur. r * 1 3. This clerk is the 'Lines Clerk' referred to in Hallows* report on the Police, vide pages 13,16, 27, 28. It appears that he has been drawing pay for men who were no longer in service and that his reputation is particularly bad; the report states that 'there can be little doubt that he has been guilty of corruption and embezzlement'. 4.

The main theme of his talk was the difficulty of introducing the system advocated by Hallows without a number of educated sub-inspectors, head constables and clerks toVUn the system and'*maintain the necessary registers. He said that it was difficult to get educated men for the police as the pay was not sufficiently attract ive by comparison with that obtainable in other employment. The remedy for this would appear to be higher pay for / educated men* I should like to consider this further before making any recommendations. 3. Shaikh Khalifah also thought it essential that numbers of men of all ranks above that of constable be sent out of Bahrain every year for training in the theory and practice of police work. I entirely agree with this. I know of nothing more difficult than trying to introduce extensive reforms into an entirely uneducated force. It means, in practice, that a few educated people, in this case the Superintendent of Police, one Sub-Inspector and a couple pf clerks have to undertake the maintenance of the entire records of the force themselves. I would go as far as to say that the system outlined by Hallows cannot be put info effect in Bahrain in less than 8 years and then only if educated men are enlisted into the police and trained in police work. I consider that this is the fi&amp;st essential step which requires to be taken. 4. T ' 7 e then turned to the subject of where this training should take place. I gave it as my view that the police should be trained in the country whose law and police Susfllii it was decided to adopt in Bahrain, because it is an obvious /•© - 2 - obvious convenience to have them trained in the legal and polled codes which they will be required to work. Shaikh Khalk#ah was inclined to favour an Arab country, as opposed to India, because instruction could be given in Arabic. He explained that both he and the Sub-Inspector who went to India had great difficulty in the law courses because they were not at that time sufficiently strong in English; nor does he anticipate being able to enlist men into the Bahrain Police in the near future who have sufficient know’ledge of English to benefit from the law courses in India. Instruction in India to men below the rank of sub-inspector is in the vernaculars* Men from Bahrain are not likely to know these vernaculars whereas they could benefit from instruction in Arabic. Egypt was considered too expensive, Iraq too disaffected. Shaikh Khalifah favoured Palestine and did not think that the police deputed to Palestine would be likely to come in contact with any more undesirable influences than if they were deputed to India. Palestine certainly has a very fine police force ; and instruction in Arabic is a very real advantage. I have not, however, as yet made up mj? mind whether this would b e the best solution and should like time to discuss it further. 5. Shaikh Khalifah did not favour the introduction of the Sudan Code of Law into Bahraih, he preferred the Palestinian Code. 6 . Regarding the powers deputed to him, Shaikh Khalifah said that he had all the powers mentioned by Hallows and had them before his report was written. He usually exercised them in consultation with the Adviser. He pointed out that the powers suggested by /-by Fallows did not delegate power to the Superintendent 0± POl±Ce t0 dlsmiss a Havlldar. I think that we should °gree to his having this power and recprd an amendment to the report I have discussed this note with Shaikh Khalifah and he concurs in it* 14 th May 1941No. 11 hi - lb of 1360 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dented, 29th J/Awal, 1360 June 23, 1941.

I have empna- ^ sised the need to be generous in the treatment of the police and- naturs. g' # Belgrave has assured me that the question is under active examination and that such increases as cs.re decided on^wiil take effect from 1st Muhurram (2dth December) -r He expects His Highness to approve his proposals titnm trie next fortnight. He will discuss these proposals with me before submitting them to His Highness. 4. I have also spoken to His Highness and impressed on him the need for an early decision. NCj — PU-bXl XUAliC0NFIDI5NTIAL Political Agency, ^ D.O.No.C/7. -nd January 1944, We all of us recognize that the cost of living in Bahrain has increased very considerably during the past twelve months and that wages must be increased by means of enhanced War Allowance-sto enable employees to purchase sufficient foodstuffs and clothing to keep themselves and their families physically fit and decently clothed. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have found it necessary to grant an increased War Allowance to their rupee salaried staff amounting to 20^ of their pay, and in addition they grant them a small bonus in the form of permitting them to purchcase rations at a price below that fixed by the Bahrain Government. They have also considered it desirable to increase the wage rate of their lowest paid employees from Re.l/~ per diem to fe.1/2/- per diem. 2. I believe that the Bahrain Government clerical staff ec- and artisan employees are already in ^eaeipt of 7 War Allowance equivalent to 4.2^% of their salary and that the Police are in receipt of an increase in pay equivalent to 10&amp; of their salary. You will, I feel sure, agree that in these difficult times these allowances are inadequate and that in view of the general rise in the cost of living it is essential that they should be increased. I suggest for your consideration, and in this connection I would refer you to my letter on the subject addressed to you in November of last year, that the employees of the Bahrain Government should be no less favourably treated than C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, /the Bahrain.the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, that is, that they should receive a War Allowance of 20% of their pay with a minimum of &amp;.10/~, and in particular that the Bahrain Police should receive generous treatment in order that they may be oneouraged to do their duty in the future and. may be rewarded for their work in the past, 3 . There was a very unpleasant rumour going about the town yesterday morning to the effect that two Katurs had oeen imprisoned for refusing to work unless they received an adequate wage* 1 trust th‘ t there is no foundation for this tale, 4 , I shall be very glad 1-o hear what proposals His Highness has under consideration as early as possible os Sir Geoffrey Prior is taking a great interest in the question and has instructed me to communicate with him by the 7th of this month.Confidential. From the Adviser to THE Bahrain Government. Bahrai n, C/2195.22. Persian Gulf. November 17, 1943. Retr ending the police pay: I discussed the matter again with His Highness and he approved of an additional allowance being given to the police of Rs. 2/8 per man per month which works out at 10% of a policeman/s basic pay though somewhat less percentage for the N.C.Os. In the case of employees in other departments is the highest rate of war allowance which is being paid by the Bahrain Government. Against this I think it should be taken into consideration that in other departments of the Bahrain Government there is a fairly generous scale of annual increments. Yours sincerely, Major gi. Hickinbotham, O.B.B. , H.B.M f s Political Agent, Bahrain.-^aujAU&lt;£y \7% With reference to your D.O. C/7 dated 2nd January 1944; I have discussed the matter with His Highness who is giving it his consideration. It is likely that His Highness would regard a general increase in the war allowance as a reasonable cause for increasing the Civil List, which is paid from Government funds. Regarding the naturs; bx. naturs were detained for one night in the Hort because tie re was reason to suppose that they were attempting to stir up trouble among 'the other naturs. Confidential D.O.

To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. MEMORANDUM Reference my telegram No.80 dated the 22nd January 1944. 2. The adviser informed me this morning that His Highness had agreed to a further increase in the Aar Allowance being paid to the regular police force. The present Wav Allowance amounts to 10# of a policeman*s basic pay. The increased War Allowance would amount to 20$ of a policeman’s basic pay. 3. The Adviser also informed me that His Highness hcid agreed to an increase of the War Allowance paid to the Natoors from Rs.3/2/- to Rs.10/- a month. This means that Natoors will now receive Rs.35/- a month pay and War Allowance instead of Rs.28/2/- a month pay plus War Allowance. The conditions of service and War Allowance paid to other members of the Bahrain Government are in my opinion reasonable. //(jp-Y' Political Agent, Bahrain._ ' IG CHF11ST T1AL • D.C.

T have suggested to Belgrave that he should examine the desirability of the Bahrain Government issuing an 'Alan maxing police service compulsory until the end of the war for all persons at present enrolled fit the Civil Police Force. Belgrave is much in favour of compulsory service and has I understand represented very strongly to His Highness the dssirabili y some such order but the Shaikh is not favourably inclined. The 'A1 Khalifah family have always disliked compulsion and much prefer persuasion. It has been their policy to pla cate delinquents, especially should they be members of the family, by increasing their allowances or making them gifts, a policy which has so far never succeeded, &lt;m X understand thlt His Highness is no exception to this rule and would much v prefer to increase the wages of the Police to such a level that they would continue willingly to ^erve. The Police are in ny opinion at the present time in receipt of e reasonable wage especially when it is consi that they receive full rations and uniform and 1 feel that to grant them an increase in wages because of the fear of thear leaving their employment would only be storing up trouble for the future. I apP«* «« an appendix to this letter a sche- 7 dale showing the present pay, allowances, and rations of a police constable and a police sergeant. It is worthy of &gt; * /note3. note that the police alone receive a rice ration and that their total cereal ration is? twice as much as a civilian adult ration* 4. Belgrave with whom I had a further discuasion on the 30th of May is continuing hie efforts to persuade His Highness to change his attitude towards compulsory police service out I am not hopeful of his success. It mny therefore be neces sary for me to take the matter up with His Highness in the near future and before doing so I shall welcome an expression of your opinion on the subject. If you are not in accord with my views then there is no more to be said ami I shall naturally take no action while if you are in favour ox com- pulsory police service with a possible immediate further increase in emoluments to sweeten the pill then I shall be fortified and strengthened when I approach His Highness. Yours sincerely / / /: V \CONFIDENTIAL D.O.No.C/847* My dear Sir Geoffrey, Political Agency, Bahrain, 31st May 1944* 9 V X Please refer to your demi-official letter ?To.896-3 dated the 21et December 1943. 2. I regret to have to inform you that the police force is slack and slovenly and little or no attempt is made to correct matters, they arc at least ae susceptible to bribes as other police forces in the Middle East, and the incidence of undetected crime continues to rise in spite of my energetic representations to Belgrevo. The reasons for this are two fold, firstly in Belgrave’s eyes the police can do no wrong and he is sentimentally averse to punishing constables and / N.C.Os, even when the proof of their neglect of duty is so clear that even he must accept it 5 secondly the nivil Police are inadequately staffed* \ 3. I consider that the time has come when Belgrave should sever his direct connection with the Police and leave the dis cipline and administration of the Force to Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed interfering as 15ttlc possible in police affairs and being careful not to undermine Shaikh Khalifah’s position by encouraging appeals against his orders. Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed may not be an ideal choice for the post of Com mandant of Police but he is much more efficient and better trained than any other Arab of good family on this side of the Persian Gulf and he should be allowed to see v/hat he can do unhampered by Belgrnve^ over-riding authority and physical appearance on parade. Let the Adviser fulfil his function and give good advice, if the advice is not taKon and. it manifestly should be then pressure can be brought to bear to ensure that it is. The Hon’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, ^ /Unfortunately Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Unfortunately I learn from recent conversations with Bolgrave that ho is most disinclined to Bover his connection with the police even to the extant which I have suggested* t In view of his very stubborn attitude I do not fool that T should be justified in saying more to him than I have already but shall be grateful if you will raise the subject with him on your next visit to Bahrain* Shaikh KhaXiioh is honesu though handicapped by powerful and dishonest relatives a no. I feel that he la becoming disgruntled from continually playing second fiddle. It is a pity* 4. It is not the time to think of re-organizing the Police Force but two or three trained ooliceman of the head constable % or aub-inspector rank arc essential axel urgently roquire&amp;ifl/ &lt; *i Za' * police commitments havlyincreased during the war years due in the main to military activities and essential war eon— s*cruct.ion works resulting in an increase m the floating population* The Force is particularly short of detectives and it has occurred to me that the Palestine Polios might oe able to come to our assistance and lend us two or three men on deputation, men who would benefit from a change to a less disturbed part of the world* If this were not possible could enquiries be made to discover if there are any retired men from the Palestine Police who would suit our purpose arid who wouh be willing to come to Bahrain on contract for say two years and /what financial remuneration they would expect?

The simplest v/ay of obtaining these instructors would be for the Bahrain Government to send four or five men to be taught traffic duties by the Sindh Police in Karachi. I anti cipate that six weeks* training should be ample and on their return these men would be in a position to instruct the other members of the Force in the ordinary simple signals used to control and direct traffic.

In fact it was necessary to produce the accused be fore the Agency Court on 1st January 194o, but owing to the fact that the court was closed on that day, New Year, we had to wait till the court re opened. We had produced the accused as soon as the court resumed work.

You will find that the Shaikhs and the Adviser put up quite a stiff resistance to any attempt to improve their Police, but it is essential that they should be driven to it. Bitter experience over the past 18 months has left me in no doubt of the in efficiency and futility of the existing Police^ though Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammad who is Superintendent under the Adviser is extremely keen and wpuld, if allowed, put all Mr. Hallows ! recommendations into effect without delay. He deserves encouragement. f (k I had Parts II and III of Mr. Hallows» Report translated into Arabic and have given copies to Shaikh Abdullah, Shaikh Mohammad and Shaikh Salman in an attempt to force the pace.
