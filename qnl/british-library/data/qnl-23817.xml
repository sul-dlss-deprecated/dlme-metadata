Sir, I have the honour to say that I understand certain facts regarding the grave of Lieutenant Keinemann are required by you and the found the questionnaire giving the details on my return from Basra. I will reply to them seriatim. (a) . The cemetry is known as the Christian Cemetry at Bahrain and is situated to the south of the idaerican Mission building at a distance of some 400 yards. (b) . The key is kept by the clergyman of the American lilission at Bahrain. (c) . The Arabian Mission is responsible for the care and upkeep of the cemetry. (d) . No cemetry register exists at present. (e).The number of the entry in the local register of deaths is No:2. The number of the entry in the register of burials is No:l. Both these registers are maintained by the Political Agent. (f) . No charge is made for graves. (g) . The nature of tenure is permanent. (h) . The graves are kept bp by the Arabian Mission but if a proper memorial were erected it would be better to place any funds for its superintendence in charge of the Agency. Little has been done to graves in the past. (i) . The position of the grave in the cemetry is notdemarcated. The graves are now being numbered and the number decided upon for this one will be communicated to you in due course. (j) . x’he grave is marked with a wooden cross and wooden surrounding. (k) . The memorial is as described above and the inscrip tion reads fT Lt .Peter Davney lieinemann R.N. ,21-13-1931 M . The cost of the memorial will be telegraphed to you later. (l) So far,owing to the paucity of Christians at Bahrain, little has been done to place the natter or. a systeroatic footing and the numbers and rows of graves have not been marked out. The whole question of the cemetry is being taken up and a plan made and when it is found what plot, \ row and number this grave follows I will inform you of it. Lieut Iieinemaim ? s death is registered by me official!} as Registrar and will be submitted in the usual return to the Registrar General in India,v/ho will presumably forward the information to the .Registrar General of Births and Deaths in England as is done in the case of British subjects who die in India.
