As the Residency Agent’s letter 419/1928 referred to in your paragraph 2 was not traceable in the Agency, Pelly asked the Residency whether they could find it in their archives. I have now received a reply from them, a copy of which I enclose for your information. The relevant reference on your files regarding the telegram mentioned in the lest sentence of the letter should be the correspondence ending with Residency Agent's letter No.99 of the 10th April, 1935, to the Political Resident.

' ii' +BDITISH ^ESI BAHRAIN. 16th November, 1951 Dear Agency, r &amp;[31 zj !$ i] Your letter 038/3/27/51 of October 3rd. 2 # The history of the ownership of Tunb down to the beginning of this century is conveniently summarised on pages 97 and 98 of P.G.13. To this may be added the statement on page 1908 of Lorrimer Vol. 2. 'Tunb belongs to the Shaikh of Sharjah and is connected with the Has al Khaimah district of his principality.' From these two statements it appears that the ownershio (using the word in its western sense) of Tunb depends at any given moment, on whether Ras al Khaimah is regarded as part of the Shaikhdom of Sharjah or as independent, and we attach a note (written in 1935 ) showing how the ownership of island has passed from one ohaikhdom to the other in the past. 3 # We cannot trace the letter from the Residency Agent enclosed with your letter under reference but it does not appear to be of much 9 value as evidence of ownership of the island. The significance of the fact that permission was sought in 1912 from the Shaikh of Sharjah for the erection of the light-house is mis-interpreted and it is clear that there can now be no question but that we regard the island as belong ing to Ras al Khaimah, (see for example the letter from the Political Resident to the Ruler of Ras al Khaii/ah to which your telegram No.53 of March 28th 1935 to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf prefers).

Both Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah were possessions of the Jowasimi clan, the heads of which resided indifferently at either place and were indifferently described as ’’Shaikh of Sharjah” or ’’Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah”. At some periods one Shaikh ruled over both places at others the rulers were separate Shaikhs. Tunb may therefore be described as belonging to the Jowasimi Tribe. Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah seized administration of Ras al Khaimah proclaimed himself independent of Sharjah and continued so till his death in 1900. Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah died. Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah reunited under Shaikh Saqar bin Khalid who appointed his son Khalid bin ^aqr as Governor of Ras al Khaimah. (Political Resident to Government of India, letter No.1672, dated the 4-th August 1912). Khalid bin ^aqar died.

The narty then returned on board and the Persian ship sailed and has not returned, ho other messages or instructions were given nor were any census papers left behind. Thera were no incident arid no attempt was r.ade to haul down the flag. not would have happened had the holster been found* I am unable to say. 4 # Other items of interest . (a; As the visit took place on the North West side of the island some three miles from Mr. Pocock's office/residence, he did not hear about it until after it was over. (b) I could not discover the name of the Persian Warship. The shopkeeper t aid it v;as a s.rnll one - much smaller than Flamingo. (c) The eldest son of the Huler of Dubai has visited fu fusa, en route to Persia to hunt. Me was entertained by i,r. Pocock and was apparently Impressed v/ith the activity on the islaud. (d) The present Shaikh of Sharjah is alleged never to have visited his island. 5. conclusions. It appears that the Persian visit took place with the object of making it clear the island belongs to ersia. I doubt if they made any impression on the locals. If Persia intends to pursue the matter she will probably do so in the months when :.r. Pococ.. is away and there is no i/&amp; W/T eo^.iunioation with the outside world. 6. cecommendations. It is recommended that a new flag be provided for &lt;&gt;u Pure. It would also be a good thing if the Shaikh of Sharjah took sore more personal interest in his island. (.^d.; ilchard Coura^o.
