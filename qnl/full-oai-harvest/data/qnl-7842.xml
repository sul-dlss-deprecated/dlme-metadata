This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Ibn Humaid</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Ibn Lami</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Executions</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Nāyif bin Ḥithlayn</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Prisoners</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000298#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
