(XS03/34(5/48)) 18th February, 194S* Restrlrited Immediate bear Belghton, The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has drawn our attention to the urgent need to make arrangements soon for the continued employment in the Oulf posts after the 1st April of the temporary Indian and Anglo-Indian subordinate staff. Already it appears that these people, who, with their established colleagues seconded from the Governments of India and Pakistan, do all the clerical work at these posts, are beginning to look elsewhere for employment after 1st April. As you may remember the period of secondment of the established staff ends on 15th August next, and Hay tells us that, even if we are able to arrange for their secondment after that date, very few of them will volunteer to stay on. In order to maintain our administration therefore it is more than ever essential to retain the temporary employees already trained in the peculiarities of the work, after 1st April. Although we shall have to reduce considerably the number of such employees in the future on secui&amp;y grounds (and the inspectors have reported to us already about this), we shall always require a small cadre of Indian and Anglo-Indian clerks for non-eonfidentlal duties in the Gulf. Local labour is out of the question at present and we want to restrict to the minimum the number of Branch B people we send to these posts for reasons of climate and because we shall need to build special accommodation for all whom we do send. /Hay » J.D.K. Beighton, Esq. Treasury.yr • 1 c w t Eay has therefore made re^onraendatl n?to us for the tezos on shleh these temporary staff should continue to he employed after the 1st April and I enclose a copy of his letter 67-3 of 6th January to the coraaonwealth Relations Office with enclosures. The Inspectors did not hove sufficient time ahile in Bahrain to go fully into these proposals but 1 enclose also for, your information a copy of Boble's memorandum on this problem. The chief consideration at present is of course that in Eoble's final paragraph vis. that *ve should be in serious trouble if the India staff talked out* and It la on that basis that ve have considered Hay's proposals. . c. - i. In general t as an interim arrangement 9 we found little to quarrel with in what he recommends and we should he very grateful for your early sanction to go ahead and apply these terms subject to the following: - 1) Pav . Hay proposes a minimum of Ra« 200 a urmth but no maximum. Se should like to reserve this question until we have had a chance of discussion with the inspectors* informing Hay that* subject to the inspect ore'views* ve shall agree to the 200 rupee starting salary and : annual increments of 10 rupees with a maximum to be fixed later*2# Dearness Allowance* We agree to this as both the Political Resident and the staff themselves are used to this method* 3* Period of Engagement* We are a little concerned the 3 year period proposed, although the k*^ointment?would in fact be subject to one month*s notice on either side, and in view of what Noble says we should prefer it to be 18 months* We should like to ask the Political Resident to try and make it 18 months but to give him discretion to offer 3 year appointments if he finds the 18 month proposal unacceptable* In view of the short time available we feel we must give him this discretion* heave * If 3 year appointments have to be made we agree with the Political Resident's proposals, except that we do not like the forfeiture of leave on account of misconduct* Donaldson tells ua that under the rules with which the staff are already familiar forfeiture of leave could not be imposed* We should want to aee the Political Realdent*8 proposals for local casual or sick leave first* Provident Fund * We cannot consider this at present* Travelllu;-; ooncefcssl- .us.

It is therefore essential that we should ascertain at once hew many of the temporary staff are willing to stay on and how many new hands we shall have to enlist in order that we may not be faced with an office breakdown owing to shortage of staff.
