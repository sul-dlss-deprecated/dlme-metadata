Stannus reports a conversation he had had at Muscat with the Imam [Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd] concerning his possessions on the coast of Africa. The Imam had complained that the British Agent had incited the people of Bombassa [Mombasa] to attack several of his dependencies, the Governors of which had requested permission to retaliate. Stannus offered to forward their letter to the Government of Bombay, but the Imam said he had torn it up in indignation. However, Stannus reports that he had already received corroboration of the existence of the letter from other sources.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024055009.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
