Even the ill-balanced diet is better than that available to many people in their homes. 42. The low standards of physical development which are attained by the majority of the population in India are associated with improper nourishment, so also are the prevalence of such diseases as rickets, osteomalacia, kerato malacia, anaemia of pregnancy and one form of beri-beri. Lowered resistance to many other diseases such as dysentery, tuberculosis, leprosy, pneumonia, etc., is caused by mal nutrition. No good can be done by telling people to drink more milk, or to eat more fruit and vegetables unless, we can show them how these articles can be obtained in ad dition to their ordinary and not instead of part of the usual diet.

Dr.Aykroyd has recently conducted an experiment on a groui: of boys of 11 to 15 years of age living in a mission boarding house in Madras. Half of the boys, taken at random, were given the equivalent of 8 oz. of skimmed milk in addition to their usual diet while no change was made in the diet of the other boys. After 14 weeks it was found that the average gain in weight of the boys who had taken milk was 4y lbs. more than the gain of the boys in the other group, also there was an additional increase in the average height of the boys in the milk group to the extent of 0.35 in. This shows conclusively that the ordinary diet was insufficient to provide material for proper bodily growth, and- it also showed the value of milk even unskimmed as an addition to the diet. The importance of accurate dietetic surveys cannot be over-estimated. The first step towards the solution of a problem is to obtain accurate \ information as to the nature and extent of the problem. 41* In the general remarks earlier in this chapter suggestions have been made about the line of action which offers the best hope of improving the nutrition of the people of India.

The abolition of alcohol in India ao in other countries would be of great benefit to tne community, cat the best practical policy is to reduce the consumption of iw to the greatest possible extent by nicely regulated duties. Education and propaganda must be relied on to combat tne n will to drink'. People can be encouraged to be temperate, they cannot be compelled to be abstainers so long as the materials for making alcohol are within their reach. 37. The policy of the Government of India is to reduce the consumption of alcohol to the lowest possible level, and it seems likely that the existing system of sale by licensed shops may prove to be as good as any which has been suggested. Prohibition is being tried as an experiment in one or two localities but in view of the ease with which country liquor can be prepared anywhere, there is reason to fear that prohibition will meet the same fate as it has done in the United States of America.HPMHI FILE ('oftX . /'T From '0 oF To The Secifti-i 4#huL iM.

In certain areas of Northern IrsL^a, the morphia hahit has been introduced: this has not attained large dimensions, hut according to Colonel Chopra it needs careful watching as its effects are far more serious than those r of opium addiction. Throughout India the ancient hut pernicio^ custom of giving opium to infants is still practised to some ■ extent. 34. The action of opium in checking diarrhoea and cough is usually the reason alleged for giving it to infants, hut the sorely tired mother too often resorts to the practice for the purpose of putting her fretful hahy to sleep. Many women who are employed in factories adopt this easy method of keeping the child quiet during working hours. The custom is, of course, not in the interests of the health of the involuntary addict. 35- Indian Hemp is a plant which grows wild in many places in North India and is easily cultivated elsewhere. Its leaves ( bhang ), flowering tops ( ganja ), and a resin which exudes from the plant ( charas ), have a strong narcotic action, hut only a small proportion of the population (0.3 to 1 per cent, according to Colonel Chopra) are addicted to its use. None the less this plant is responsible for a considerable amount of injury to the mental and bodily health of large numbers of people in India. mindexed P.Z. $ &gt; jc. • * DRAFT LETTER TO INDIA.

The Public Health activities of the Central Government. 12. By the Government of India Act of 1919 responsibility for medical relief and public health was transferred to the provincial governments. Only a few subjects were retained under the control of the central government such as legislation with regard to infectious diseases, external public health relations, port quarantine, statistics and the medical research department. Under the new constitution the position remains much the same. The Government of India has now taken an important step which v/ill bring it again into touch with public health in the provinces and so rectify a serious defect in the constitutional position. This step consists in the setting up during the present year (1937) of a Central Advisory Board of Health for the purpose of promoting coordination of effort between the Provinces and States of India. This Board has no executive powers and therefore cannot encroach on the powers or responsibilities of the local governments, but it is certain to have a great influence by providing for advice, consultation and cooperation with regard to public health questions. 13. The Central Government has a small Medical and Public Health section which is included in the Department of Education, Health and Lands.

Drug addiction in India. 33- Europeans have a tendency to exaggerate the evils of the opium and other drug hahits which exist in India. Colonel Chopra, who has made a special study of the subject, points out that in extensive areas of all provinces the consumption of opium is less than that laid down hy the expert Committee of the League of Nations as being suitable for the medical and scientific needs of the population. Indeed, many people who have lived long in India have hardly ever seen an opium addict. Opium is taken hy the mouth in small quantities hy large numbers of people, hut everything goes to show that very few of the opium eaters become slaves of the habit. Prohahly the average Englishman suffers greater injury from alcohol than the average Indian does from opium. Cpium smoking, which is much more pernicious, is only practised in certain parts of Assam, tne Central Provinces and Berar. In Assam there is one opium smoker for every four opium eaters: in the other areas the proportion of smokers is much less. The Government of India ■P.Z. indexed BT SEA KAIL.

It is true that they have achieved high standards of health and economic prosperity, but on the other hand they are confronted with a very undesirable elimination of the best elements of the population as the birth rate among the educated classes is so low that the children are not enough to replace the parents. 47 • The only Western city in which the educated and prosperous members of the community have larger families than the less prosperous is Stockholm. What has happened in Stockholm may happen elsewhere, so that the choice need not necessarily lie between the Scylla of over-population with poverty and the Charybdis of race-suicide with prosperity. Homo sapiens ought to be able to devise satisfactory means of regulating the growth of population, though it must be admitted that his past efforts in this direction have not been successful.r*V O P.Z.

INDIA OFFICE46. From the replies to the quest!cnnaire already referred to it appears that the average age at which Indian girls begin to cohabit with their husbands is 14 ? and these girls have their first baby at about the age of 16 on the average. Each mother gives birth to rather less than 6 children on the average so that before the age of 30 most Indian women must already be worn out with child-bearing. Some reformers think that raising the marriage age of girls by three or four years will be a complete remedy for the existing evils. Undoubtedly the mothers would be better educated and better fitted in every way for the task of child-bearing, but on the other hand the average size of the family might well be greater than at present and more of the babies would survive. The experience of Ireland shows clearly that the problem of a swelling population would not be solved by so simple a method as delaying marriage by a few years. Conditions of life in Ireland during the first half of the 19 th century were similar in many respects to those of India today: early marriages (at about 20 to 25 years of age) caused the population to increase from 4i millions in 1800 to about 8 ^ millions in 1845. Then came the famine which more than decimated the population, v/hile emigration relieved the pressure to the extent of a million and a half of people within a few years. At the present time the population is about 4 i millions and the SfhTlqsS; Warn ^ jindexed p.z. r DRAFT LETTER TO INDIA. * BY SEA MAIL. t-LJ 0 ! 0 /^ P i ? j \ t * 6B38 @1 g *t(V !940 j SECRET The For^argn Secrej^arfy, External A££&amp;irs Dept. 2 3 DEC 1940 ^6-1*-' *^ z- &lt;- H ~' - At the request of the Foreign Office, I enclose herewith^-packet addressed ^ /» '—^ — / * — — - -— i. for the favour of onward transmission hy safe opportunity.

Quite possibly the yield from each acre has increased, but even so the production of su itable food is ooviously in great defect so that a considerable amount of lee way has to be made up apart altogether from the provision for a rapidly increasing number of people.

Cultivators, however, are now beginning to realize the advantage of growing fodder crops on their farms;they; have been stimulated partly by the need for greater supplies in the off-season, partly by their increasing interest in the dairy side of animal husbandry , and partly by the demonstrations of silage, as a means of carrying over kharif fodders and surplus monsoon grass into the hot season.

Water Supply. 25 . The cities and most of the larger towns of India have fairly good supplies of pure water. The Public Health Commissioner in his report for 1935 says that 88 per cent, of the people in towns with a population of over 50,000 have a reasonably pure water supply, but in towns with less than 30,000 inhabitants only 19 per cent, enjoy this benefit. The rural population is in a much worse case; the expenditure on water supplies by District Boards throughout India was about 15 i lakhs of rupees against more than a crore spent by the municipalities which serve a much smaller population. v In the rural areas of provinces a few efforts are made to supply the villages with wells, or other forms of water supply. The Punjab appears to have paid more attention to this problem than the rest of the provinces. 26.

There are now 39 cattle breeding farms in India. In the Punjab, breeding at Hissar and elsewhere had the advantage of being controlled in the early stages by a veterinary officer with a knowledge of stock breeding, and also of opening on a large scale. The first real movement towards improving the village livestock took place in the Punjab. Bulls from government farms were sent out to the district boards for village service, on condition that wherever such a bull was sent all scrub bulls should be castrated. There is no doubt that this steady output of bulls caused steady improvement in a tract which has the advantage of including fodder crops to some extent in the crop rotation. 29.

If no safe opportunity occurs before the first of these recyphering tables is due to come into force (i.e. 1st July, 1936), it will be necessary for the old tables to be kept in force in respect of correspondence with Kashgar. I am therefore to reouest that, if it appears likely that this expedient will have to be adopted, the India Office may in due course be informed in order that the Foreign Office may give the Embassy at Peking and any other holders affected the necessary instructions.
