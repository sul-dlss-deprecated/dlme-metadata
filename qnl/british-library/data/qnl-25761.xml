Ty dear Tetcalfe, Could you please refer to your Personal letter of 28th April referring to my Personal letter of the 4th of Larch 1938 (a copy of which I sent to Watts) on the subject of the treatment of the followers in Muscat of His Highness the Aga Khan, and saying that His Highness had again returned to the charge asking that we should use our influence with the Sultan so that he would look on the Aga Khanis with a friendly eye. His Highness made no specific allegations and no particular requests. You added that you had no idea what His Highness was driving at. 2. I am afraid no more have I ! but I imagine that, as explained in my letter of 4th March 1938, the Aga Khanis are inclined to be somewhat truculent in their attitude towards the Muscat authorities and expect us to procure for them a privileged position in the State to which they are not entitled. However, I am sending a copy of this letter to Hickinbotham with the request that he will find out from the Aga Khanis what, if any, definite complaints they have of their local treatment, and in any case to help them as much as is possible. Yours sincerely, 3d/- T.C. FOYIS.

British Consulate and Politcal Agency, Muscat, the 19th June 1939. Would you please refer to your personal printed letter dated the 7th June forwarding a copy of your personal letter of 7th June to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe? 2. I asked Mukhi Khalfan Murad Ali, the President of the Aga Khani Council, to see me on June 17th. This gentleman informed me that there had been some little differences of opinion in the past but that now they had no question of any sort to bring forward and were perfectly content. I suggested that he should so inform His Highness the Aga Khan. Yours sincerely, 3d/- T. Hickinbotham. The Hon*ble Lt. Political Col. Sir Trenchard . KCIS*, CBS., Resident m the Persian Bushire.

Your followers thus seem to be quite happy, and I hope there will be no further cause for complaint. ISith all best wishes. I am, Yours very sincerely, Sd/- H.A.F. METCALFS ToThanks for your private and personal letter of the 21st April sending for my information copies of recent correspondence between the Aga Khan and Symon. The Aga Khan addressed me himself on the 7th April telling me that he was writing to Symon and stating the position of his followers in Muscat. He was not very precise in his complaints and merely asked me to be kind enough to use my Influence with the Sultan, so that U c he should look on the Aga Khan f s people with a friendly // eye. I had correspondence with the Aga Khan on the same subject about a year ago and I then wrote to Fowle and asked him to do what he could. Fowle reolied in March 1938 that the Aga Khan's followers had nothing really to complain of, but that they had made themselves somewhat unpopular by^ruculence of their attitude towards the Muscat authorities. Fowle had seen some of them during a tour to Muscat and had warned them to be more careful. I have now written again privately to Fowle giving him the gist of the Aga Khan's complaints. I have also suggested that he should ask Hickinbotham, who is shortly relieving Watts as P.A., Muscat, to look into the matter and find out what the trouble is. When I hear from Fowle, I will reply to the Aga Khan and will■ ; 1 - 2 - wlll also let you know what transpires. Yours sincerely R. T.

I have already written to the Government of India - to Sir A. Metcalfe. I do not want you to write in any way officially, hut I thought you might bring about a sort of message of good-will, as you have been so much with the Sultan, explaining that it was only absence from England that prevented me from paying the Sultan a visit and entertaining him during his visit to London because I know he has misunderstood my apparent lack of courtesy.

S.W.l.r / INDIA CL'FICS, P.2.2497/39 Private andrersonal . 21st April, 1939 I enclose for your information copy of recent correspondence 'between the Aga Khan and Symon of this Office from which you will see that the Aga Khan is concerned once more about the position of his followers in luusc't State* Symon, who is now Stewart’s private secretary, knows the Aga Khan well and was also attached to the Sultan of Muscat during the latter’s visit to England last year. Between 1930 and 1933 there was trouble at Gwadur between the Khoja and Baluchi communities but the Sultan then took action witi: salutory results (see correspondence ending with the PdLitLcaL RosLdont ' s letter dated 3rd March 1933 No. C/41 addressed to the Government of India) and we have heard nothing from the Gulf of any recrudescence of trouble* The Aga Khan’s letter however suggests that it is the attitude of the Sultan himself that is now unfriendly to his followers.

The papers in the attached volume (P.3113/29) show that there was trouble between the Khojas and the Baluchis at Gwadur (there was also a minor incident at Muscat proper) between the years 1929 - 1932. It v/ill be noted that the Aga Khan approached the Government of India direct in regard to these disturbances, and that the differences between the two communities were settled satisfactorily with the active co-operation of the present Sultan. The Aga Khan f s letter to me suggests that the present trouble is between the Sultan and the Khoja community, but even so I assume the proper thing is for him to take up the matter with the local political authorities through the Government of India. My difficulty is to frame a refusal to the Aga Khan v/ithout causing him any offence. As you are aware,I have known him for some time and am on quite friendly terms with him. If we tell the Aga to take up the matter with the Government of India, I suppose we had “better send them, and also perhaps Sir Trenchard Powle, a copy of the correspondence. Do you think there would be any objection to my telling the Aga that I am sending the correspondence to Sir Trenchard - this would let him know that vie v/ere not indifferent to his request? 14th April, 1939. —NH VILLA JANE AN DREE BOULEVARD DU CAP Tel. 5-52 ANTI BBS &lt;a.m.&gt; 7th April 1939. Dear Mr. Symon, The present Sultan of Muscat is, unfortunately, very prejudiced against my followers out there. I know, too, that he was disappointed that I did not see him and entertain for him during his recent visit to London. At that time I was not in England - nor even in North France - so I was not able to see him as I wished. I know you were attached to the Sultan while he was in England, and I shall be most grateful if you will write to him and use your influence so that the relations between the Sultan and my people in Muscat may be more friendly in future, and I hope you can persuade him to look on them with a friendly eye. With many thanks, Yours sincerely. A . C . B . Symon Esq., India Office, London .
