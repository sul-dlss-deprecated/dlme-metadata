The file includes a copy of the contract (in French) agreed between the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Iran, and the British Legation at Tehran, dated 9 June 1941, for the purchase of salt on Hormuz by the Government of India (ff 82-86). Much of the subsequent correspondence concerns the expenditure of the contract. The file also includes discussion of Frank C Strick &amp; Company’s concession for red oxide production at Hormuz. The file’s principal correspondents are: HM Ambassador to Iran, Reader William Bullard; the External Affairs Department of the Government of India; the Foreign Office.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Frank C Strick and Company Limited, shipping company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Hormuz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Salt industry and trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Ferric oxide</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00004b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00004b#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00004b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
