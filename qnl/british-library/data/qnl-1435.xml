P olitical D epartment. From, T he C ommissioner in Sim To, The Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier. Commissioner s Office, Kurrachee, 2Srd August 1870. Sir, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1167, of the l7tlt instant. The subject of the Khan of Khelat's communications with the Sirdars of Seistan was disposed of by me in my letter of yesterday, and as your letter under reply only contains a eontinuation' of the very unnecessary sus picions and surmises formed by you, with reference to proceedings at Khelat, on which I have already quite sufficiently commented, I need not discuss them further. The reply stated in the latter part of Captain Harrison's Diary for Monday, the 11th, to have been given by the Khan to the Seistan Sirdars, should have been sufficient to convince you of the unfounded nature of the impressions you had formed,, and should have deterreil you from writing in the manner you have in the letter under reply. 2. The circumstances referred to by General Jacob, in the words quoted by you, are very different to the present ones. The paragraph should be read in connection with the following ones, wherein it is shown that General Jacoh* alluded to the traitorous proceedings of the Wuzzeer, Mahomed Hussan, who had been secretly thwarting the former's efforts in hopes of getting the Khan into bad odour. General Jacob was then using his best efforts to support the Khan, Meer Nusseer Khan, and to promote a strong Government. You are really acting in opposition to the Khan, and complain of being thwarted by him and his officials ! 8. There is very much of the greatest value in the old records of the Frontier of Upper Sind, but unless statements or opinions therein found are taken as parts of the whole, and not merely picked out, because they seem to confirm a preconceived idea, they are very apt to mislead. The quotation of a fragment, without explanation as to* what called it forth, may lead to a very wrong application. 1 have the honor to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant,. W. K MEREWETHEK, Colonel, Commissioner in Sind.
