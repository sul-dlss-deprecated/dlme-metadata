Although rooted in oral tradition, the tale of Khusraw and Shirin found its greatest expression as one of the five narrative poems of the <i>Khamsa </i>(Quintet), composed by the celebrated Nizami of Ganja (1141&ndash;1209), one of Iran&rsquo;s greatest masters of romantic poetry.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2009-08-03", "date_added": "2009-08-03 15:00:23", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 20, "name": "Arts of the Islamic World", "folder": "arts_of_the_islamic_world", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 1206, "title": "Royal Persian Paintings, The Qajar Epoch, 1785-1925"}], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 5435, "name": "Shiraz, Iran", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "1997.108.7_IMLS_SL2.jpg", "id": 14023, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/1997.108.7_IMLS_SL2.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/1997.108.7_IMLS_SL2.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 95}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 190}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 380}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 760}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1520}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/1997.108.7_IMLS_SL2.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing, From Pictorial Cycle of Eight Poetic Subjects</em>, mid 18th century.
