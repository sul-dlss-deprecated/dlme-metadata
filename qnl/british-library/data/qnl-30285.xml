Storm broke evening of July 20th with the allegati Mrnia.n that three cruisers had arrived a week ago. while centre papers like Ettelaat and Iran accepted the story with caution and refrained from comment, other papers appear to have accepted its truth and commented accordingly. Zendegi later mentioned the possibility of troops having been brought. There was considerable degree of unanimity on all sides. It was breach of international regulations; it was infringement of Persian sovereignty and a threat to her independence. Such behaviour was inconsistent with Britain's professions of regard for the rights of small nations and in particular with Bevin's recent statement. Situation in Khuzistan did not justify this action and in any case threat and force would not pay, lovernment should appeal to United Nations Organisation. ),iyam-I-Iran (Centre) made comparison with Hitler’s behaviour. Dad (Left) felt that Persians had become pessimistic about British policy, while Nejat-I-Iran [Left) considered that the prestige of Britain's rival md been increased.

Your telegram Nos. 52 and 55. I saw Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning and spoke about both questions, reminding him that His Majesty’s Minister had pointed out that the Persian authorities application for facilities at Bombay v/as an additional reason for their meeting our request as regards notification of ships' visits. Ministry of Foreign Affairs had subsequently deprecated any bargain. His Majesty’s Government were now happy to grant desired facilities unconditionally. It was however a fact that both His Majesty's Government and the Govemmen of India were disagreeably impressed by the contrast referred to in the second paragraph of your telegram No. 52, and they definitely expected that their accommodating spirit as regards Bombay facilities would be reciprocated. I then gave the Minister for aor^ign Affairs communications on both subjects and asked him to read them. Before doing so he expressed thanks for the Bombay agreement and on the othe subject said that die Ministry for Foreign Affairs had been doing the Abadan, His Majesty's Ships giving as as long notice as possible® Omission®.*%50 umission of anv refp tpupp t y lfleci number of hours' notification was deliberate. 'The conoetent + - , n oo.ipetent autnorities held strongly that it would be embarrassing in practice and unnecessary inasmuch as in these cases action would devolve on Anglo-Persian Oil Company alone on j-ewi -^isian aatnorities. Minister for Foreign Affairs thought on the contrary that thirty-six hours was reasonable, and tnat omission of specified period would create trouble: period might be, however, further reduced to twenty-four hours. I thanked him but asked him to press the Ministry of bar in return for our accommodation over Bombay to accept the procedure suggested in my aide-memoire. He promi .ed to do so and to let me know the resuxt by Saturday. I did not refer orally or in writing to the second paragraph of your telegram No. 33 as I believe that this is agreed. 3. At the end of the friendly interview I again asked him to meet our wishes outright with a view to clearing away, while His Majesty’s Minister was in London, certain disagreeable impressions recently created in London, and India. His Excellency took this in good part.

Article 2 of the regulations published by the Persian Government in September 1934, regarding the visits of foreign warships to Persian ports and their passage through Persian territorial waters,restricted in some respects the right of/passage of foreign warships and required that the Persian Government should be notified through diplomatic channels regarding visits to Persian ports or passage through territorial waters in the case of one or two J-L warships, and' permission must he obtained in the case of a larger number of vessels. 2. His Majesty’s Government were reluctant to accept this regulation, because it was importent that His Majesty’s Government’s ships should be able to call at Abadan at the shortest notice f or/for refuelling and at Bushire to transport the Political Resident and his staff. 3. The Persian Government were accordingly asked to agree to the continuation of the existing system of direct notification to the port concerned. The Persian Government were only prepared to agree to this on condition that similar facilities were accorded to them in respect of the ports on the Arab coast in the Persian Gulf. Jti.M.G. were not aA* r t/i ritiw JO.. -L „ j - - 7 ^ ^ ~ .

After lengthy discussions the Persian Government have accepted the first part of these proposals, out so far they have held out over Abadan. 4. Whilst these negotiations were still proceeding a request was received from the Persian Government for repair for two Persian warships at Bombay. This held Tz ^T/sC e hopes of a bargain, and it was suggested that the docking facilities should be withheld pending satisfactory settlement of the question Abadan. Thi3 idea has however, been abandoned, as iCt , oth er reasons, it transpires mat the Persian Government ^ f . ment mlght be to obtain the repair acilities in a private dockyard at ^ _ * a ' ^o^bay.

It is also possible that if two questions Y/ere delinitely linked Persian Government might give way (if they did so at all) merely with intention of cancelling special Abadan arrangements as soon as their navy was independent of Indian dockyards. 2. For these reasons grant of docking facilities should not be made conditional on satisfactory outcome of Abadan discussions but may at your discretion be used in those discussions. You could, in particular, when informing Persian Government that docking facilities will be granted a,s soon as accommodation is available, mai^e it clear that Eis Majesty* s Government have been disagreeably impressed by contrast between readiness of Persian Government to assume that Government of India will at any time grant valuable privileges at Bombay and their unwillingness to make trifling concession to His majesty’s Ships and add that as His majesty’s Government are grant- ing docking facilities they naturally expect that fersian Government will deal with Abadan question in as accommodating a spirit as possible. 3. Persian Minister recently expressed hope of his Government that two questions would not be linked and was told that point was still under consideration, but that if His Majesty's Government decideddecided agairs t linking them in the sense of making them inter dependent they would certainly expect that lersian Government^ whose attitude had made disagreeable impression, would adopt more friendly attitude than hitherto in what was purely matter of practical convenience, M.

The only way in which Persian vessels could be prevented from refitting at these private yards would be by a direct refusal for permission to visit D CE1 p a y Such a refusal would be contrary to Admiralty policy and would set undesirable precedent which might be used against us. Having regard to foregoing and paragraph 3 of Mr. Knatohbull Hugessen’s telegram No.56 to foreign Office it is not considered desirable to link up question of Abadan and refitting sloops so directly as you suggest. Mr. Knatchbull Hugessen is being instructed to try and obtain permission for urgent visits to be made to Abadan for fuelling upon local notification only, using Persian request for facilities at Bombay at his discretion. 1615/1. for Head of M.

I said that I was quite prepared to deal separately with the two matters hut in view of certain recent happenings in particular the discourtesy of Persian government in never replying to our proposals regarding han on tribes- men (my telegram No. 167 to Government of India last year gives last reference) and over Gorich Kalag much doubted whether Government of India would in any case he disposed to he accommodating.

W immediately preceding telegram* As regards the visits to Abadan for oiling, Motame told me in confidence that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have suggested to the Ministry of Jar that they should agree to 48 hours previous notifica tion instead of 8 days with the same proviso as in other cases, viz. that local notification shall hold good in the absence of contrary advice from Tehran to the local Governor. This proposal has not been put to me yet, as approval of the Ministry of War is first necessary. 3, As regards repairs at Bombay, it seems probable that if we make consent conditional on acceptance of our proposals regarding fuelling at Abadan, Ministry of War will refuse to budge. On the other hand there is as far as I know nowhere else where they can geu repairs for their ships until the installation of Mre floating dock.

It has already been pointed out to His Excellency Monsieur B.

For this reason it was explained that inconvenience would be caused by the necessity of notifying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as many as eight days in advance of the proposec visit to an Iranian port of any of His Majesty’s Ships permanently stationed in the Persian Gulf* 3. Nevertheless the terms of His Excellency Monsieur B.Kazemi’s 'v letter have now been carefully consid ered by His Majesty’s Government with the result that His Majesty’s Minister has been instructed to suggest the following arrangement. (^) In order to meet the desire of the Iranian Government visits of His Majesty’s Ships in the Persian Gulf to Iranian Ports will henceforth be notified to the Ministry of Foreign t Affairs by His Majesty’s Legation in accordance with Article 2 of the above- mentioned regulations. Nevertheless it is suggested! that, as these regulations only provide for notificatcn as opposed to permission, if the number of visiting ships does not exceed two, it would prove convenient and expeditious to both sides if information of notification in the case of His Majesty’s/&lt;1 Majesty^ Ships stationed in the Persian Gulf were simultaneously addressed to the local authorities concerned direct through His Majesty’s Consular Officers on the spot. It would he understood that if any of His Majesty’s Ships arrived at an Iranian poit after* notification had been given provided above, the competent local authorities, in the absence of any communication from the Imperial u'Overnment, would raise no objection to the visit. On their side the Iranian Government would undertake to issue general instructions in this sense to the proper local authorities in ports of the Persian Gulf. (b) It would, however, prove extrealy difficult in practice to apply the provisions of (a) to His Majesty’s Ships visiting Abadan for the sole purpose of fuelling, since such visits have to be made when circumstances demand and cannot be forecast long in advance. It is therefore preposed that when one of His Majesty’s Ships proposes to visit Abadan for the sole purpose of fuelling the only notification should be made direct to the Governor of Abadan as long as possible in advance by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah. It would be understood that visits thus notified would not constitute official visits involving exchaig es/exchanges of calls 'between the Oaptain and the Iranian authorities, that no member of the Ship f s crew would be landed and that the ship would cast off as soon as oiling was completed. As such visits, as distinct from courtesy visits, clearly have no political significance His Majesty’s Government feel confident that the Iranian Government will agree that notification through the diplomatic channel can be waived and that the simplified procedure suggested above be followed.

Your Excellency’s proposal that the ships in question should avail themselves of the exception provided in Section 3 of Article 3 of the Regulations regarding the passage through, and stay in, Iranian waters and ports of foreign warships dated 7th Shahrivarmah 1313 {August 29th 1934) was duly considered by the Departments concerned and views were expressed in those Depart ments which have twice been notified in detail by Mr. Motamedy to Mr. Mallet and Mr. Sumaerhayes, members of the honourable Legation to whom the difficulties which exist for the time being for the Imperial Government in accepting Your Excellency’s proposal were clearly pointed out. I feel confident that you have already been informed of the particulars of those discussions. Apart from what has been already explained, as the authorities of the Imperial Government are granting and will continue to grant, facilities and the utmost assistance to ships which desire to enter Iranian coastal waters and Ports in accordance with the regulations in force, there seems to be no occasion for the anxiety expressed by Your Bxcellenoy as to the difficulty of obtaining permission or of giving previous notification.

We agree that it is desirable to endeavour to secure Persian consent to local notification only in cases of ships fuelling at Abadan, this not to constitute a visit involving calls or landing of any member of ships companies and Senior Naval Officer suggests that advantage would be gained if we could secure arrangement for notification through Vice Consul at Mohammerah to Governor of Abadan rather than through Ahwaz and Governor General which involves considerable delay. I propose to proceed on these lines and to suggest simultaneous local notification in all other cases as instructed in paragraph 4 of your telegram. 3.

Military Branch, ADMIRALTY, S.I.l. ™ ' 16th August, 1955. My dear Baggallay, with reference to our telephone discussion last nignt, I enclose herewith a copy of the telegram which we have sent to the 3.JN.0. Persian Gulf, together with a copy oi the message from the Commander-in-Chief to which it refers. in view of the s.N.O’s impending departure for Tehran it was a matter of urgency to get this off as soon as possible. *e hope that you will concur in our view that a special arrangement for fuelling at Abadan on short notice to the Consul is a reasonable proposition, and that you will instruct Knatchbull Hugessen to endeavour to secure such an arrangement. in connection with the question of fuelling at Abadan, we have also been considering the position of oilers on Admiralty service at Abadan. As you are.•••••, H.L. Baggallay, Esq., POhhIGK OFFICE, 0. W. 1*are probably aware, these vessels fly the Blue Ensign. /atiele 1 oi the regulations states that the term 'warship' 1 shall include every armed or unarmed ship which Dears a ’flag of war' and carries out governmental duties. Although these regulations have been in force for some time there has so far been no suggestion that they should be applied to oilers, and if any attempt were made so to do, it is thought that we should be able to argue that the Blue hnsign is not a 'flag of war.' It is an invariable rule that commissioned snipe, which alone are author!sea to fight (as distinct from defending themselves) fly the white Lnsign. The term 'flag of war' is, however, extremely vague, and is a translation from the Persian. If it has some peculiar significance in that language, or if, for any other cause, there is doubt about the position of Admiralty oilers at Abadan, it would be an additional and very strong reason to press for some special arrangement for fuelling at Abadan. I am sending a copy of this letter to Glauson. ®. A. SEAL.COPY. MESSAGE* To Senior Naval Officer. Persian Gulf. OUT. Commander-in-Qhief, Past indies. Addressed Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, repeated Cooiiaan&amp;er-in-Ciiief, East Indies, from Admiralty. Your &lt;30042/7. Admiralty view is that Persian desire for 8 days’ notice through the diplomatic channel for visits to Persian ports, as required by Article 2 of new Persian regulations, can be accepted, but that it is desirable to endeavour to secure special permission for vessels to call at Abadan for short periods for lueiling merely on notification through Consul. it is probable that a certain amount of inconvenience and additional expense would be caused by fuelling in Bawarda Reach, and it would seem to be a perfectly reasonable request that visits of ships to Abad*n purely for fuelling, as distinct from courtesy visits, should be treated as having no political significance and therefore as not requiring diplomatic notification. Such visits would of course be very brief and vessels could cast off from Persian shore .oo» .. oiling ».0 »„.n oo. ( l,l, a . p Admiralty concur that reciprocal extension of existing V arrangements to enable Persian sloops to visit A»**ab coast cannot be admitted. As regards Persian ports other than Abadan, it would presumably be intended to continue existing system of direct notification to local authorities in addition to notification to Tenran. Representations as to desirability of special arrangement! at Abadan are now te ing made to Foreign Office.

Tuis message is repeated for information. Addressed C.in C. tast Indies 929 from 8.S.O. .R.O. Persian Gulf. Reference telegrams Hos.Ul and 112 to busnire from Minister Tehran. Existing arrangements require minimum of 60 hours notice be given tor H.M. Ships to proceed to Abadan to refuel. Anglo Oil Company inform me that arrangements could be maae to refuel sloops in Bawarda Beach, They would like months notice and would detail and prepare a lighter for the sole use of sloops, lignter containing ^miralty specification fuel only. Existing arrangements for visit to Iraq require seven days prior notice but shorter notice is acceptable for urgency. Such as hospital cases# Bawarda Reach being Iraq waters I am confident an arrangement for 48 hours notice or less would be acceptable to Embassy at Baghdad. 4. In addition permanent permission would have to be obtained from Basra Port Directorate for sloops refuelling there as refuelling in stream is normally prohibited. 5. It is remarked that Persian Sloops frequently refuel from lighter in Bawarda Beach and it is most improbable that any notice given to Iraq Government though permission obtained from Port Directorate Abadan. 6. Bushire should it be necessary to communicate with Political Resident this can be done by meeting Consular boat at outer buoy which is just outside three mile limit and would be feasible except during Shemal or Kaus force 5 and above. 7. Suggest therefore that it would be preferaole to abandon notice sooner than give reciprocity lor Arab ports and Islands in Gulf. 8.

In a matter such as this, His Majesty’s Government felt that it was very desirable to secure the maximum measure of uniformity, both for the sake of convenience and for the avoidance of any possible misunderstandings and difficulties, and it was therefore presumed that the Imperial Government would desire to accede to an arrangement wuich had worked so sa tiefactori; over such a long period of years. 3 # Monsieur Hotmmedy appeared to appreciate the force of these arguments and, while he was naturally unable to return any definite reply himself, promised that the matter would be carefully studied by the Ministry of War* 4 ^ x have now received a note from the Acting /Minister . imi3S^£ ^■■Igtognj ^atch Ho. a -n i t ^±^L^JH^ A4ndi ^une. 1935 .

He went on to say, however, that the only reciprocity wanted fcy the Iranian Government was for Gulf ports on the Arabian coast and that no request could be made for such reciprocity because the special treaty relations of Hi© Majesty's Government with the Arab aheildis were not recognised by the Iranian Government* 4.

Hurst wrote: At aost I believe such a right of passage for foreign warships to be a .aatter of international comity and not an absolute right, and being merely a matter of international comity, the aovereign of the country through whose waters the ships are to -ass is entitled to withdraw the permission as and when he considers that circumstances require it. 2. Vr. neckett investigated the position as regards foreign regulations on the subject and the views of writers on intemotional law, and the following views were expressed in a letter to the Admiralty: There is no unanimity among the authorities in international law on the question whether foreign warships have an absolute right of passage through territorial waters; but Hr. Chamberlain is advised that the proper view is that international courtesy requires such passage to be allowed unless there are special reasons against it. However this may be, no State is likely to dispute the ri t ht of a State to deny such right of passage through certain portions of its territorial waters for reasons of national security; such a right is implicit in the admitted right of self- preservation It is possible that the right to deny passage for reasons of national safety may not be held to apply in the case of territorial v.'aters which ••••••••* form part of a general sea-highway;3. As a result of the constderati „ e advtnced by ^ Foreign Office, it W as agreed hy the A dn,iralty that „ 0 proteat should he ffi ade against the Yugoslav regulations since, as state. the Foreign Office, the only restriction on the right of innocent nassage, if the existence of such a right could he heie to have been established, resulting from the regulations W as one to 'hich objection could not properly be Ween by His Majesty’s Government. . This matter was also among the points investigated by the Preparatory Committee of the Conference on the codification of international lav;. The reply of His Majesty's Government, In the United Kingdom to the Preparatory Committee as regards ’innocent passage’ stated:- I Foreign warships and merchant-vessels have a right of innocent passage through territorial waters* A right Oi innocent passage is also recognised for fuhmarines providing that they are navigating on the surface of the water. •?hile generally the replies of the various countries allowed in principle the innocent passage of warships, it may he noted that Bulgaria and Roumania required prior permission or notification in the case of warships. 5. In, a letter of 7th July the Admiralty pointed out the difficulty of the position, as some countries refuse to admit that warships have a right of innocent passage through territorial waters, and went on to give the following account of the discussion at the Hague Conference of 1930. The United States delegation were at first opposed to the recognition of any such right hut afterwards, as a result of the British delegation iumressing on them the importance of such a right to a strong naval ^ower, modified their attitude. The principal countries who Maintained their opposition were France and Holland/138 Holland «„d .or. o^portod „„ s „ Mn , Roumania a.aongst others. 6. Certain draft articles and observations *ere drawn up at the Ha t ,ue Conference, but as stated by the Admiralty, they only represent a compromise drafted by the rapporteur on the basis of the discussions as interpreted by him. They were not nut to the Conference in this form and the report was not seen by the delegates until just before the Conference broke up. Among the draft articles (and observations) was the following: As a general rule, a coastal State will not forbid / the passage of foreign warships in its territorial sea and will not require e. previous authorisation or notification. The coastal State has the right to regulate the conditions of such passage. Submarines shall navigate on the surface. Observations: To state that a coastal State will not forbid the Innocent passage of foreign warships through its territorial sea is but to recognise existing practice. That practice, also, without laying do-'n any strict and absolute rule, leave to the State the nower, in exceptional cases, to prohibit the passage of foreign warships in its territorial sea. The coastal State may regulate the conditions of passage, \ particularly as regards the number of foreign units passing simultaneously through its territorial sea ^ or through any ■^articular portion of that sea *= though as a general rule no previous authorisation or even notification 'rill oe required Under no pretext, however, may there be any interference with the nasrage of warships through straits constituting maritime traffic between two parts a route for international of the high seas. ?./I3y 7 ' ™ e Adall'filty out ot certain reflation, the Il8U 0I &gt;iirsbipe ^ Danzig.

Before the regulations had been issued, a desnatch had been addressed to His .Majesty’s Consul at Danzig, on the subject ne position was set out on the lines of naragranh 5 above, and it was stated that as the Hague Conference of 1930 'Droved abortive, the question of innocent passage for warships remained doubtful in international law. The Danzig regulations did not specifically deny to foreign warships the right of passage through Danzig territorial waters in any given conditions, but merely reserved the general right to refuse it in certain special but unspecified circumstances. In the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, which has consistently been maintained, warships and merchant vessels have in fact such a right of innocent passage. It v/as considered preferable, il possible, that the regulations should omit all reference -o the right of passage through territorial waters and should be Drought into line with the regulations of other countries in this respect, which/,hi 0h only t&lt;&gt; vl „ lt .

These instructions, however, were too late to enable any attemot to be made to modify the regulations. v,hen these were issued (paragraph 7 above), the Admiralty desired that a protest should be made. There was some difference of oninion in the Foreign Office whether our position in regard to the right of innocent passage would he affected by failure to make a protest, but it was finally decided that a protest should be made. In accordance with instructions. His Majesty’s Representative at ’'arssv; addressed a note (1st August, 1953) to the Polish Government in which it was stated that His Majesty’s Government do not recognise the right of a country to prohibit the innocent passage of any vessels, including war vessels, through territorial waters and that consequently they were unt b^e to accent in its entirety the document communicated to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations containing the Danzig regulations on the matter. The Polish Government have not yet submitted their views in answer to this protest. (Signed) A.F.Orchard, POPFIGN OF'TCH 9th December, 1933oNotes. Register No. P. Z. 2233/35 Minute Paper. SECRET.

Persian regulations regarding visits of foreign warships to Persian ports and their passage through Persian territorial waters. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. The text of the regulations which were published last September will be found at Flag C* They were issued in pursuance of Article 4 of the Persian law regarding territorial waters (copy at bottom of file). X The most important article in the regulations from the point of view of H.M.G. is Article 2, which restricts in some respects the right of f innocent passage of foreign warships through Persian territorial waters and which requires that the Persian Government should be notified through the diplomatic channel regarding visits to Persian ports or passage through territorial waters in the case of one or two warships, and that permission should be obtained in the case of a larger number of vessels. Under Article 3(3), however, the/ provisions of of 'warships Article 2 do not apply in the case which possess special permission from Persia'. $ After consultation between the Foreign Office and the Admiralty, the instructions contained in the two Foreign Office telegrams of 20th November last at P.Z. 7286/34 were sent to Tehran. It will oe ^ £ that the Minister was instructed to address a note seen to the Persian Government placing formally on recoid the view of H.M. G. that, in so far as the Persian law ( &gt; and regulations make innocent passage 01 either belligerent or non-belligerent foreign warships conditional on prior notification, they are contrary to established international law and practice. As regards notification of visits, the Foreign Office and the Admiralty agreed with the Minister at Tehran that it would be best in the first instance to assume that the Persian Gulf Squadron were covered by Article 3(5) of the regulations as being 'warships which possess special permission from Persia', in view of the arrangements reached with the Persian Government in 1932; but Mr.Knatchbull- Hugessen was authorised to make a formal application to the Persian Government for 'special permission' for the Persian Gulf Squadron if this should prove necessary. 4 The Minister’s note to the Persian Government on the subject of 'innocent passage' is at P.Z. 7801/34 IS d.tjtxA ^ fox and the text of the Persian reply which has now been received is enclosed in the Foreign Office letter of 19th March (p.Z.2053/35). The Persians contend that there is no established international law on the subject ( ) of innocent passage and that each State is entitled to lay down whatever provisions may be in accordance with i l s special needs. The question is apparently an extremely controversial one andthe Foreign Office are\ &lt; 142 Minute Paper. Department. advised that it will be difficult to make a conclusive case to snow that the Persian Government are claiming more than their rights. They consider, therefore, tnat nothing is to be gained by making further protests to the Persians, especially as H.M. »s ships do not normally need to pass through Persian territorial waters except in the neighbourhood of Parur Island unless bound to or from a Persian port. Subject to the views of the Admiralty, the Foreign Office propose that H.M.G. sxiould make no further communication to the Persians at present but should maintain their own views in regard to innocent passage if occasion demands and meanwhile continue to use the accustomed route near Parur Island without notifying the Persian authorities. f With regard to the question of notification of visits, it was hoped at first that the Persians were in fact prepared to regard the Persian Gulf Squadron es coming under Article 3(3) of the regulations without the necessity for any further application for ’’special permission from Persia”. But the Ministry for For si gji Affairs finally raised the matter with the Charge d»Affaires at Tehran at the end of February during Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen's absence in the Persian Gulf and intimated that the Persian Government wished to regularise the position in accordance with the new regulations (P.Z- 1542/35). Prom the conversation between Motamedy and Mr. Loxley it is not quite clear whether the Persians intend to insist on notification of visits throu^the diplomatic channel or whether they only desire that the existing arrangement, should be regularised by a formal application for 'special The Minister at Tehran andjthe Senior 295 6 6000 7 34 permission” Naval/Hava i Officer saw no objection to informing the Persian Government of visits through the diplomatic channel in addition to direct notification to the port concerned, and the Foreign Office proposed to authorise Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to reach an arrangement on tnese lines at Tehran. The Admiralty, however, feared that if the programmes of sloops were communicated to Tehran, the Persian Government might be tempted to forbid them access to Persian ports. The India Office is not very directly concerned and we intimated informally to the other two departments that we should prefer to wait until they had reached mm agreement before expressing our views. Actually owing to an oversight the Foreign Office omitted to consult us x before sending off the instructions agreed with the Admiralty and contained in their telegram of 26th March i at P.Z.2233/35; but the telegram^which instructs the Minister to make every effort to secure the continuation of the_ existing arrangements without modification 6*1^^ la- yif/fs * I seems Entirely satisfactory from our point of view. ^ The Persian regulations as a whole have been examined in detail by the Admiralty, who consider that they call for no further representations to the Persian Government except in regard to the scale of salutes laid down in Article 13, which differs substantially from the scale which has been in force -ior several years between the principal maritime Powers. The note addressed by Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to the Persians on this subject is at P.Z.1962/35. The question is of some importance since under the Persian regulations a salute of 11 guns is accorded to a ( &gt; Sarhang or Colonel (although the international scale does not provide for a salute for this rank) and it is possible/ I**.

Military Branch, ADMIRALTY, S.w.1. Mth March, 1935, Dear Baggallay, May I refer to your printed letter No*E*1378/5/34 dated 5oh March, 1935, on the subject of notification of visits of sloops to Persian Ports, Under t&amp;@ existing arrangements visits of sloops permanently stationed in the Q-ulf to Persian ports are only notified to the local authorities, note that -natehbull-Hugessen, after discussion with the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, now proposes to superimpose upon this arrangement a system of notification direct to Tehran, with the avowed object of keeping the Persian Government if au courant ’ of the movements of the sloops, and that you are disposed to accept this arrangement. We feel here that it would be unwise to accept such an arrangement unless it is impossible to avoid it. Notification of the movements of the sloops to Tehran would be likely to constitute an almost irresistible temptation (uae Persian itch for self assertion is well known), and at any time of strained relations we should run tne risu of access of the sloops to e.g. r ear Abbas or Bushire being forbidden. ttr Gut of si *ht out of mind’ ? has in the past be a SOUJld policy. After the Basidu incident H.M.3. SfesftTfKE (whose programme had to be sent to Tehran) was forui&gt;..,,.u, to ^i~it Persian poits during the Commander-in-Chief f s visit to tne Gulf, and it seems to us probable that if the programmes of the sloops had had to be communicated through the sane caaanel, they would have been subject to the s.. -o ixiteruict.

Motamedy did not ask us in so many words to conform strictly oo Article 2 which requires eight days notice but merely said that it was desired that notification should be made here* I did not press him on this since I thought it best to postpone all discussion but I think conformity with Article 2 is what was meant. On the other hand as soon as 1 mentioned Article 3 Motamedy spontaneously volunteered statement that special arrangements were possible and i got the impression that Persian Government's objection to existing arrangement lay in the fact that it had been reached before regu lations were issued and that they regarded it as having been rendered out of date by latter. I do not think they necessarily even want a new arrangement but merely that position should now be regularized. There was no suggestion of complaint or protest in what Motamedy said and while tone of his remarks does not necessarily indicate the temper of Ministry of War my impression was that original request might be inter preted as tactful way of drawing attention to regulations and that any suggestion on our part oased on Article 3 would be sympathetically received. As....2. As Motamedy agreed to postponomont Of discussions I did not say that wo should he prepared to ask for special permission under this Article nor did I argue inconvenience of making notifications here. But in case Ministry of War still want to he notified even if they waive eight days notice I feel it would he useful if Senior Naval Officer could provide material for use in argument.

(P) of the 16th January reporting a conversation between Bennett and M. Ala about the frontier in the Shatt-el-Arab. le note that at the end of paragraph 1 M. Ala is reported to have said that the Persian Government would be prepared to extend to the Shatt-el-Arab the system now existing in the Persian Gulf, under which British war vessels stationed there had general permission to visit Persian ports subject to notification of the local authorities, while visits of other war vessels had to be notified to Tehran for special authorisation. This seems to show that the Persian Government regard the old system for notification of visits of the Persian Gulf sloops as unaffected by the New Regulations. You will no doubt consider whether this part of the conversation and its significance should not be brought to the notice of the Legation at Tehran, in connection with the authority given to the Minister in your telegram Saving, No .8 of the 20th November (NO.E.6994/579E5A 34) to apply if necessary for 'Special Permission' for the Persian Gulf sloops under Article III (3) of the Regulations.

With regard to the question of 'innocent passage' through territoribl waters, I am to observe that Article 4 of the recent Pe stan Law on territorial waters specifically recognises this right , except in so far as belligerent warships are concerned. It Is possible that Sir Reginald Hoars might be able to make some me of this fact in bringing the matter to i the aoti.ee of the Persian sovernraent. T am also to state t hat H.M. Sloops in the Persian Saif often pass within the territorial waters of puats and frarur I elands, and it is therefore not correct to say that the occasions when British warships pass through Persian territorial waters arc eer, rare. Stth regard to the proposal that Sir Reginald Koare should h. authorised, if necessary, to submit an application for 'special permission' under Article ITT the sloops Persian 8ulf. I am to observe that such permission, if g^ted. would only eremit these ships from the provisions of Article Tt. fhere are provisions in the other Art idea (e.g. Articles VTIT - proh ibitioa of landing without permission, which, objectionable as they are in themselves, would be doubly so at Henjam.

I am also to observe that imtil Basidn has been formally surrendered to the Persians, there can be no quest ion of the Begulations being applicable there. Their l#ordships are causing, the detailed provisions of the Regulations to be examined, and a further letter will be addressed to ^ou on the subject in due ©ourae, Copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office, Board of Trade, and Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries I am, h i r , four obedient Servant,K 5ft«e/570a/34 KOVMOtlv o Vic I 18th October, 1934, Sir, With reierenca to ?orei^n Office letter 5793/^793/34 of 20 th Se?&gt;te her enclasiiii, e co^y of a telegraa f**o«s His Sweaty*s ' iRister at Tehran eu^arising t?i© regulations which the ^-ereian GoverrA^CTit have recently iasued for the control of the visits of Joreign wars ips to 'eraian ports, I am directed by Secretary Sir John 8 i&amp;ah to trans Lit to you herewith a cony of a despatch whie,„ has now been received iro.a Sir Reginald Hoare on this subject. 8 , ?n he Lords Co mmissioners of e Ad miralty will see that Sir Reginald Hoare nas asked ior a renly by telegraph to his enquiry whether a protest should at once be addressed to the Persian Ooverna'ent against that part or Article II of ti.e regulations which purports to t ake the passage of foreign wars hips through Persian territorial waters conditionai upon the receipt of prior notification through the diplomatic channel, li Their X*ords:.iPS agree, Sir John Simon proposes to instruct Sir ?Reginald hoare to address a note to the Persian G&amp;vcm^&amp;Tit placing formally on record t.»e view of fits Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that In so far as the new regulations restrict the right oi innocent passage they are contrary to established, international law and practice. He doubts whether it is necessary for the present actually to lodge a protest or to ask lor the repeal Of the regulations, particularly U he 1® right in believing that The Secretary of the Admiralty*that the occasions on which British warships require to pass through Persian territorial waters, except in order to visit Persian rerts (including Ken Jam end Basidu), feust he very rare« r -'he position would be radically altered if any part of tiie HooXa channel were eventually formally declared to lie in terslsn waters, ml in that case the views oi Hie Majesty'??

Clive’s despatch No. 37 of the 19th January, 1929. Probably, however, as a result of the action taken by Sir K. Clive at that time the Persian Government have now separated these present regulations from the more serious subject of the definition of territorial r waters which as you are aware, have recently formed the subject of a law passed yo r by the Majlis (see my despatch No. 320 of the 30th June last)] 3. I have as yet received from the Persian Government no notification omcial or otherwise, regarding the issue of these regulations. I have examined them in the light of Sir Austen Chamberlain’s despatch No. 194 of the 24th April, 1929, and have the honour to offer the following observations, which, foi facility of reference, will be classified under the four categories mentioned therein. Category “ A ” (cases where it is reasonably clear that the Persian regula tions infringe established rules of international law). Article 2 would appear to fall within this category. It is in itself none too clear, but it appears to make a distinction between “notification ” in the case of two ships or less and “application for permission ’’ in the case of more than two ships. The distinction seems more or less meaningless, as in either case the regula tion lays down the necessity for application to the Persian Government through the diplomatic channel at least eight days in advance, even in the case of innocent passage through Persian territorial waters. In the light of Sir Austen Chamberlain’s despatch referred to above it would appear clear that this regula tion is a violation of international law. 4. Categories “ B ” and “ D ” do not appear to apply to the present regula tions, but rather to the law regarding territorial waters. Category “C ” (cases where the regulations are within the rights of the Persian Government, but where their enforcement might possibly give ground for His Majesty’s Government to object for the reason that they discriminate unfairly against them and would not conduce to friendly and harmonious relations) appears to cover the prohibition in the second paragraph of article 2 against foreign men-of-war staying for more than seven days in the ports and territorial waters of Persia. The penultimate paragraph of article 8 limiting the freedom of foreign warships to land unarmed parties of seamen would also appear to fall under this category. 5 . It may also be found necessary to take exception to the point in article 25 insisting on the provision of specifications to the Persian authorities of the make of the wireless apparatus used in His Majesty’s ships. The questionnaire to be filled in by visiting men-of-war (Appendix No. 1) is also, I understand, most unusual, and might possibly be considered as falling under Category C. 6 . The senior naval officer, Persian Gulf, happens to be on a visJ J - 110 at this moment, and he has kindly furnished me with his comments on the regula tions, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy nerein. 7. It is not clear to me whether the Persian Government intend these regulations to apply to Henjam. Equally, I am not certain whether the exception in article 3 ( 3 ) whereby the dispositions of article 2 regarding noti ca ion, ^ c., shall not apply to “warships which possess special permission from Persia is intended to apply to the Persian Gulf Squadron. I should like to think that this - B [215 bb—4]'I !1 4 - is so and that the issuing of these regulations is not intended to be provocative. , . nossihle however that in any case we shall be expected to apply tor Si special permission in the case of the Persian Gulf Squadron, and I should be “ateful for instructions whether to do so m case of need. Meanwhile I believe the proper course is to assume a satisfactory interpretation of the above two Doints. If the Persian Government were to protest against our ignoring these regulations it would be easy to answer that we were loth to assume, in the absence of any official communication or prior friendly discussion, that the Persian Government had torn up the modus vivendi reached with leymourtache on the 10 th May, 1928, and confirmed by his Highness Feroughi on the 3rd February, 1932 /see rnv despatch No. 76 of .tffi&amp;J jlth Februa jry^J.932). 8 . If you approve this course of action, the mam question which remains to be determined is whether it is desirable at once to lodge a protest against that part of article 2 which falls under Category “A.'’ I should be grateful if I might receive instructions on this point by telegraph, as, if a protest is to be made, the sooner it is done the better. 9 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, His Majesty's Charge d’Afiaires at Bagdad (No. 70), the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 159), the senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf (No. 107 M), and to His Majesty’s consular officers at Ahwaz (No. 71) and at Mohammerah (No. 7). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1 . Regulations concerning the Conditions of Passage and Anchorage of Foreign Warshi'ps in Persian Waters and Ports. (Translation.) THE Council of Ministers, in its session of the 7th Shahrivar, 1313 (the 29th August, 1934), in accordance with proposition No. 19488 of the Ministry for foreign Affairs, in accordance with article 4 of Chapter II of the law determining the limits of Persian territorial waters and zones of naval control, has approved in the following terms the conditions of passage and anchorage of foreign warships in the waters and ports of Persia Article The term “warship shall include every armed or unarmed ship which bears a flag of war and carries out governmental duties. / !i mes of peace foreign warships may pass through Persian em orial waters or enter ports, on condition that the number of ships in company witn one another shall not exceed two.

The said officer commandino- may, while observing necessary precautions in accordance with local practice' send ashore the ship’s doctor or his representative to the local health office ?n Older to give necessary information to the health authorities and to obtain information concerning the sanitary formalities which must be observed Art - On approaching a naval port, and while within the limits of its defences, 01 at the time oi departure from an anchorage, a foreign warship must if so requested by naval authorities, accept on board an officer or other repre sentative who may be appointed by the said authorities for special Guidance: and whatever the said officer lays down concerning the route which°the ship must take for entry or exit shall be complied with. The guidance will be gratis, and will entail no responsibility whatever for fhe Impellal Government or for its representatives. Moreover, this special guidance is completely separate from ordinary pilotage which may be required by, 01 for, the ships bv means of the usual signs, or trom local pilotage which they may enlist for themselves or which port regulations may have provided for. At't. 6 . Foreign warships will be obliged to exchange courtesies by means of gun-fire and an exchange of visits on entry at the anchorage of a Persian port, in conformity with special ministerial decisions which may be laid down in this respect. Moreover, whenever a foreign warship enters one of the ports of Persia in which one or more Imperial warships which are able to return a salute with gun-fire are present, the exchange of courtesies by gun-fire will be compulsory. Art. 7. The existence of closed zones, or the details of the temporary or permanent closure of zones, will be brought to the notice of mariners through the diplomatic channel, or else by means of notices published by the Water Department. The warships of the Imperial Government which are in the neighbourhood of the above-mentioned zones must give this information to foreign warships which pass in that vicinity by means of international signals. Art. 8 . Foreign warships which stay in Persian ports and waters must observe the laws and regulations of sanitation, and the laws and regulations of ports and of finance. By way of international courtesy the above-mentioned ships are exempt from customs examination, and customs duties will only be levied on goods which are imported to the shore for consumption. The above- mentioned ships, on condition of reciprocity, are exempt from ports dues, tonnage dues and the like. Foreign warships, throughout the whole of the period of their stay at ports and of their passage through Persian territorial waters and zones of control, have no right to carrv out operations of surveying or of sounding, nor may they, without special permission, carry out any exercises, or any operations of landing or firing or torpedo-firing or mine-laying. They may not carry out any kind of submarine operations, unless they have previously obtained the assent of the local naval authorities. The above-mentioned prohibitions also apply to boats belonging to the war ships and to travellers thereon. All flvino- by any aeroplane which may be borne by a warship or which ma\ accompany it or be towed by it is forbidden, except after t e planting o specia permission by the naval authorities. Foreign submarines which enter Persian territorial waters or ports or which desire to leave, must remain on e sui ace o the water during the whole of the time, and their submersion without previous permission from the proper authorities of the imperial overnme G _ Warships are not allowed to send ashore armed parties trom their crew m from other persons who may be aboard, except when permission hasbeen previously granted by the local (naval or military) authont.es, or in their absence b '' ‘office^TndTakS [ ? petty officers] may proceed on shore wearing the sword which forms part of their uniform.

Art. 10. The salute of guns mentioned m article 6 which is given by the ship to the shore or vice versa will consist in each case of twenty-one rounds. If the entry into a port by a single ship is repeated on more than one occasion this salute will also be renewed. But if the interval between two entries does not exceed three months the local authorities are entitled to agree to dispense with a salute of guns. Art. 11 . If, at the time of the entry of the foreign ship into the port, His Imperial Majesty is present in that port and the Royal flag is hoisted in the port, the twenty-one-gun salute given by the ship on entry will be regarded as a salute m honour of His Majesty and no answer thereto will be given from the shore; but when the said ship gives a further salute of twenty-one guns after the first twenty- one guns a formal salute in reply will be given from the shore in accordance with article 10 . Art. 12. If, in a port in which a formal salute of reply has been given to a State, warships of the Imperial Government or of other nations are present, an exchange of salutes by gun-fire, in accordance with the various ranks of the com manding officers, will take place after the rounds fired in honour of the State. Art. 13. If, at the time of entry of foreign warships at a port, warships of the Imperial Government are present, the exchange of formal salutes which will take place in relation to the various ranks of the naval commanding officers will be in accordance with the following list:— Guns.

In any case, immediately on the arrival at a port of the foreign warship oi ships, an officer will at once be sent from the naval commander to the commander ot the ship or ships aforementioned, in order that he shall congratulate him on his arrival and pay respects. After that, an exchange of visits will take place. A rt. 22. If, on the entry of a foreign warship or of foreign warships at a port, any Imperial warships are also present there, the formalities of an exchange of calls shall be carried out by the senior of the commanding officers of the ships; and m this case this exchange of visits shall, as a matter of practice, take place in the same place as the exchange of visits carried out by the naval commanding officer. A rt. 23. The principle which shall govern the performance of an exchange of visits between the officers of the Imperial navy and the commanding officers of the foreign warships or ships is this, that the first visit shall be paid by that person whose rank is the lower or, if ranks are equal, by the person who arrives last. Art. 24. The performance of an exchange of calls on occasions when the foreign warship or ships enters a port officially will be in accordance with a special programme arranged at the proper time and forwarded for the information of the commanding officer of the ship or ships above mentioned through the diplomatic representatives of the State to which the foreign warship belongs. Art. 25. Foreign warships and aeroplanes accompanying them at the time of their stay at one of the naval bases or in waters neighbouring naval fortresses, must, if they wish to employ their wireless telegraphs or telephones, inform the commander of the naval base of the make of apparatus and of the length of wave which they will employ and also of the time of sending messages and must then obtain permission for sending messages.i , .)/■ jf r | le foreign warships and the aeroplanes accompanying them A u 26 ;„tiL than rhose mentioned above and are not in the vicinity of those ports' the' admitted to use their wireless telegraph and telephone for sending messages subject to the following conditions : (a) Sending messages on a wave-length of 600 metres is forbidden and is W only to be effected in messages asking for help and m replies thereto. ^ (b) No interference must take place with the signals from national wireless stations, whether fixed or moving. .
