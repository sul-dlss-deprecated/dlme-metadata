No. 'a-o /s.F.of 1353 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, Maharam, 4. 1353 April, 19, ly34. From The Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to submit for your infor mation the State Budget for 1353 and the annual report and particulars of Revenue and Expenditure for 1352. This is the ninth budget which I have had the honour to prepare. The annual report is very brief. Many matters which should have been mentioned have been omitted. Owing to the fact that I am pro ceeding on leave in three days most of the report was prepared before the end of the year. I have had a great deal of additional work to complete during the last two months besides my ordinary duties, I have carried out the work which used to be done by the Assistant Adviser and Commandant of —of Police and during most of the summer, while the Director of Customs was on leave, I have dealt with the customs work. It has been impossible for me to afford the necessary time to compile a full report. The 1353 Budget . Owing to unexpected revenue from the Bahrain Petroleum Company and from the lease of the Muharraq aerodrome it has been pos sible to balance the budget by including the balance from 1352. I. Customs Receipts . I have estimated the revenue from this department at the same figure which I estimated in last year f s budget though the actual receipts during 1352 amounted to appro ximately Rs 6,09,000/-. It may be reasonably assumed that the revenue during the coming year will exceed the sum which I have anticipated. YI. Oil . This sum includes eight instal ments of Rs 5,769,/- of which Rs 30,000/- is repay able from future royalties, according to the arrangement agreed upon between the Bahrain government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Although it is practically certain that the oil company will commence shipping oil during the coming summer and that royalties will become pay able to the government during 1353, yet I have not assumed, in making this budget, that any revenue from royalties will be received. VII. Lease of aerodromes . This includes the rent of Manamah aerodrome and the rent of the Muharraq aerodrome for 1934-35 which I assume will be paid in advance in October 1934.-3- 3 Items YIII to III are estimated according to the receipts from these sources during 1351, it is probable that they will produce the amounts which I have estimated, XIII. Interest on Reserve . This is cal culated on the assumption that the Reserve Fund will remain at the present figure which is Rs 2,00,OCX)/-. If, as is probable, the Reserve Fund is increased from certain sources there will be a corresponding increase in the interest which it yields. IY. Loan recoverable . This represents the instalment of a loan made to the Muharraq Municipality to pay for their share of the capital in the Electric Scheme. Balance from 1352 . The particulars of this balance can be seen in the statement of revenue etc. The balance includes £1000. paid at the of a the year by the British Government for lease of the Muharraq aerodrome from October 1932 till October 1934. Expenditure . The expenditure differs very slightly to the amount shown in the previous year. The allotment for the Sectretariat is somewhat higher than in 1352 as it includes leave passages for the Adviser which are payable once in every four years. The total expenditure represents only the amount necessary for main taining the present administration and allows for no expansion in any direction. It will be noticed that the Civil List absorbs considerably more than half the total expenditure.4 ~ 4 ~ The Bahrain State is not encumbered by any debts, the Electric Department however during the last two years has failed to pay its way and has borrowed from the Deposit account the sum of Rs 15,000/- approximately which if not paid off from future profits will become a liability for the government. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.Notes on Revenue and expenditure 1352. He le nas. The actual revenue received during 1352 amounted to approximately Rs 42,000/- more than the revenue during 1351. Customs receipts showed an increase of approxi mately Rs 8,000/-. This is explained in the Customs report, the increase is mainly due to the increased customs tariff which in the previous year had only existed for^some months. Passports receipts show a falling off of about Es 1,000/-. Rents from government land and oil concession are greatly increased owing to payments by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and also the payment of the rent of Muharraq aerodrome. Interest on Reserve Fund has decreased owing to the withdrawal of Rs 50,000/- from the Reserve which previously yielded interest. The remaining revenue sources have yielded approximately the same amount as they did in 1351. Expenditure . The total expenditure during 1352 was approxi mately Rs 47,000/- less than the expenditure in 1351. The chief saving was in the Civil List in which there is a difference of Rs 24,600/- owing to the death of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali and a reduction in the Ciiil list of 11,500/- owing to the Zjgfo cut and the death of certain persons who were included in it. Of the remaining items some show an increase but KL— is a saving on their total. The extra cost of State protection is owing to the fact that during the year10 year the Police force has been brought up to strength and it was necessary to purchase some new uniforms and equipment to replace v/orn out material. The actual expenditure exceeded the actual revenue by approximately Rs 4,000/- although in the Budget for 1352 I expected a deficit of Rs 90,000/-.Revenue comparison.* ! - ♦ Comparisonof 1352 Budget and actual Revenue and Expenditure. Revenue. When making the Budget for 1352, I estimated a deficit of Rs 90,000/-, fortunately owing mainly to unforseen circumstances, my expecta tion was incorrect. Owing to the unsatisfactory trade prospects and depression in the pearl industry I estimated revenue from Customs, pearling licenses etc. at Rs 5,50,000/- whereas the actual amount collected was Rs 6,08,97?/-, approximately Rs 58,000/- more than I expected. In several of the other items I overestimated the revenue. The debt of Mohomed bin Subah was not repaid and eventually the government took over his property in discharge of the balance. He owed Rs 9,000/-, the property is worth less than Rs 1,000/- but this individual is virtually bankrupt. The order sanctioning a tax on artesian wells was unfortunately repealed by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad owing to protests of two or three leading merchants who owned several wells. The unexpected revenue from oil increased the heading of ff Rents of Government Land 11 from Rs 15,000/ to Rs 55,000/-. Expenditure . On the expenditure side there is an increase of Rs 5,000/- approximately over the amount which I estimated. This is due to the costs of the auditor which were paid at the begin ning of 1352 and which had not been allowed for in the 1352 budget. Without considering the facts which I have explained in these notes it might very reasonably be considered that the discrepancies between my- 2 - my 1352 budget and the actual results are unreasonably great. When I made the Budget I considered that it would be dangerous to assume that more than the amount which I estimated would be obtained from the customs sources and I was not aware that an arrangement would be made between the government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company by which the government would receive about Rs 40,000/— more than the annual rent. yThe Pearl trade and the Diving industry © The 1352 season. The slump in the pearl trade and the conse quent depression in the diving industry still con tinues but it appears that the 1352 season showed a slight improvement over the previous season. I form this opinion after examining the accounts of the authorised diving clerks who make up the accounts between the divers and their nakhudas. These clerks have dealt with the accounts of 345 boats out of a total of 436 and I have taken the results of their accounts as a basis on which to calculate the average of the whole catch. These figures represent the rockbottom prices paid to the nakhudas, they differ very greatly to the prices obtained on shore when the pearls have passed through the hands of several merchants and they differ even more to the prices paid for the same pearls by foreign buyers in Bahrain and Bombay and ultimately in Europe. 2. The results of my calculation are as follows. Year. total No. of boats. Total value of pearls in Rs. 1347/1348 1348/49 1349/50 1350/51 1352 538 509 504 456 436 Es 21,25,000/- 18,32,000/- 12,14,000/- 13,40,000/- For the purpose of comparison I have included the the figures of previous years. Although 20 less boats went out to the banks the value of the catch was Ijf lacs more than the previous year.The Catch. 3. The total weight of pearls during 1352 appears to have been about the same as during 1351, though in 1352 there was a marked decrease in the number of high grade pearls but an increase in the number of medium and low grade pearls. Very few important pearls were found. Two were sold for about Rs 20,000/- each, but only one of them belonged to a Bahrain boat. The divers in this boat received about Rs 600/- each. Another pearl was sold for Rs 10,000/- of which the divers received Rs 230/- each. Both were small boats. In past times the price of Rs 20,000/- for one pearl was so frequently paid that it would not have been mentioned in a report as an exceptional price. 4. The price of pearls in Bahrain during the first half of the season was 10$ higher than the corresponding period the year before, but after the middle of the season the price fell somewhat. 5. All the Bahrain merchants have sold their new pearls, at a small profit, but many of them are still encumbered by large stocks from previous years and the value of undrilled pearls decreases every year. A few merchants have been able to dispose of some old pearls when selling the new ones, but they sold them for about a quarter the price which they originally paid for them. Some of the biggest merchants still hold old stock which they cannot afford toto sell at such loss as if they sold they would become liable for payment of the final instalment of the original cost price. The purchase of pearls on long time instalments is one of the causes of the present depression but it is inevit able as few people are in possession of ready money. 6. The record peatfwhich was purchased in Bahrain for £15,000. some five years ago has finally become the property of Princess Milvani n£e Hutton, n the Woolworth heiress', who bought it last year in Paris to form the centre of a necklace on the occasion of her wedding. It was sold in Paris for considerably less than the price paid for it in Bahrain. The Diving Systems. 7. During 1352 there was a further increase of 59 in the number of boats diving on the Khammas system and a corresponding decrease in the Selifieh system. This change is significant. It is an unmistakable sign that merchants have no longer the capital to finance the boats. Briefly the difference between the two systems is as follows.- System?* 1 U) The nakhuda borrows money from a merchant with which he pays the annual advances and finances the boat. The nakhuda receives l/5th of the profits and the remainder is divided among the divers and pullers. The merchant charges interest on his loan to the nakhuda and the nakhuda charges interest on the advances to the divers. (ii) Khammas System . The nakhuda provides the capital himself and takes the share of fiveMr- five divers. Accounts are settled after each trip to the banks and no debts against divers are carried over to the next season. Each diver is advanced a few rupees before each trip. The increase in the Khammas system has the advantage of tending gradually to do away with the loan system but it is universally recognised that Khammas divers are not as efficient as Selafieh divers, they do not remain so long at sea, they dive less frequently during the day and are not so amenable to discipline as they are not bound to continue diving with the same nakhuda. Regarding the two systems from a broad and humanitarian point of view it is evident that the Khammas system is the best, but commercially it is the least profitable. Diving debts. 8. The advances for 1352 were settled as usual at a meeting of the leaders of the diving industry and the announcement that the advances would be the same as during the previous year raised no protest. Several people at the meeting suggested a further reduction. 9. Very few divers earned more than the total amount of the advances but in many boats the Selafieh divers accepted advances of less than the authorised amounts knowing that if they did not agree the nakhudas would not take them out. The government order forbids the nakhudas to advance* more than the specified amount, it does not forbid advances of less than■5- than this sum, provided that the divers and nakhuda come to a mutual arrangement. The result of the season is that most of the divers who received the full advance have increased their debts but most of the Khammas divers earned a small amount. Mortgages. 10. There is a striking feature, very evident in the courts, which reveals the changed conditions in the diving industry. In the old days, some five years ago, the nakhudas never had any difficulty in obtaining money from the merchants to finance the boats for the season. During the last two years the merchants have been insisting on receiving mort gages of land and property from the nakhudas in return for their loans. This is entirely contrary to the spirit of the diving system and is resented by the nakhudas. The merchants on their part complain that owing to the uncertainty of making any profits it is necessary to protect their loans by mortgages. In the past if the nakhuda was unable to satisfy the merchant the latter could take over the nakhuda f s boats and divers. Reasons for depression. 11. The depression in the local pearl trade is attributed to the following causes. (i) The European markets are dull. (ii) The pearl banks are giving out. The whole diving community agree that the actual quantity of shells on the pearl banks is decreas ing each year. The opinion is shared by the foreign buyers and refers not only to the Bahrain- 6 . Bahrain oyster beds but to the pearl banks through out the Gulf. At the end of last season several of the leading men discussed with me the possibility of closing some or all of the banks for a season as is done in other places in order to give the oysters a chance to breed. Such a step would only be effec tive if the restriction was enforced on all the pearl ing communities of the Gulf. Such action would be advantageous in some ways, it would probably result in the merchants selling off all their old stock and in an increase in oysters. The argument against such a step would be that thousands of divers would be out of employment for a year. If work could be found for them during the diving season it would be possible for them to exist. I estimate roughly that about 4 lacs would have to be spent on labour in order to provide work for the Bahrain divers if they did not go to the pearl banks for one season. (iii) The increased manufacture of cultured pearls. Unfortunately for Bahrain the Japanese are manu facturing cultured pearls which are more and more difficult to detect. They aim at doing away with the dark artificial centre of the pearl which now provides the means of detecting its falseness. The government has been asked to instal one of the electric machines for testing pearls. A machine could be purchased but it requires an expert to work it. (iv) The increased number of Khammas divers. (v) The decrease in the total number of divers.(vi) Changed weather conditions. During the last five years wind conditions have altered. The 'Bara' forty days wind, used to blow before the diving began, gradually it has started later and it now blows during the diving season with the result that for many days the sea is too rough for diving. The main season cannot be altered as it is settled to coincide with the time that the sea becomes warm and therefore it starts ten days later every year. These are the reasons to which the depres sion is attributed to locally. Cultured pearl case. IB. Khalil Bakr, a Qattar pearl merchant trading in Bahrain, was found guilty of contra vening the cultured pearl regulations. The case caused widespread interest not only in Bahrain but in all the diving communities throughout the Gulf. The last case of a similar kind was in 1348 when Abdullah AlZaid was sentenced by the Bahrain Court on a similar charge.Police and Public Security. S3 The State Police. 1. The strength of the Police at the end of 1352 was 153 including one Arab officer and eighteen N.C.Os. At present three Indian Army N.C.Os and one Indian Police N.C.O are attached to the Police as instructors. All the men in the force were en listed in Bahrain but not all of them are of local origin, some Persians have been enlisted as well as Swahilis, Sudanese and manumitted slaves. I find that the last category respond well to training and make good policemen. I consider it wise not to enlist only local born men. During the last two years the feeling in Bahrain towards the Police has altered very greatly. There is keen competition to enlist as a police recruit and the local popula tion, which used to regard the police with complete lack of interest has now developed a patriotic regard for them. 2. The four men who were sent to India for training with the 10th Baluch Regiment returned after completing a nine months course. The experi ment has been very successful. The men were first put to the ordinary recruits’ course, then they were given special training as instructors and finally they were put in charge of recruits. They can now train the police recruits by up-to-date methods and they have the great advantage over the Indian instruc tors of being able to speak the language of the men they are teaching. Two of the four men were N.C.Os, the other two young policemen were promoted to Lance Naiks on their return.- 2 - 3. At present about forty men, including two recruit sections, are available for daily parades. The remainder are occupied by duties including jail guards, point duty in the bazaar, steamer parties, aerodrome guards, detachments at Hedd, Muharraq. and Sakhir and guards at the Political Agency, Police Station etc., a few men are usually on leave or sick. 4. The health of the present force is better than that of the Indians. Malaria is the most prevalent illness. It increases dur ing certain seasons in spite of constant inspec tions of the Fort and married lines to detect breeding places of mosquitoes. It seems that most of the men acquired the disease before they joined the police. So far there has been a sur prisingly small amount of venereal disease although the population as a whole are riddled with it. More than fifty per cent of the men who offer themselves as recruits fail to pass the medical examination on account of defective eyesight. The minimum height of a police recruit has now been settled at 5ft. 6inches although some of the men who were previously enlisted are consi derably under this height. 5. In addition to their routine duties the police have provided numerous guards of honour during the year for His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and various distinguished visitors includ ing the Commander in Chief, East India Squadron, and the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq. During the visit of the Mediterranean Destroyer FlotillaFlotilla the Police took part with the Navy in a ceremonial parade and march past in honour of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad, afterwards they entertained 250 sailors at an Arab dinner in the Fort* During his visit the Commander in Chief permitted the marine band of H*M.S. n Hawkins n to play on the police parade ground an act which was much appreciated by the police and the local population who attended in great numbers. A proposed national anthem for Bahrain, composed by the bandmaster, was played. Arrangements are going to be made for the tune to be recorded on gramophone records in order that it can be played by the police band. During the anniver sary celebrations of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad f s accession the police carried out a ceremonial parade in front of the palace, but unfortunately it was not as well done as during the rehearsals as the noise of the drums and the singing of the Arab dancers made it impossible for the words of command to be heard. On one of the days of the anniversary holidays sports were held by the police consisting of races, tugs of war, jumping etc., though most of the men had never seen or taken part in such an occasion they all displayed the greatest keenness in contesting the various events both individually and in sections. 6. Towards the end of the year the police have been receiving a course of lathi instruction from a N.C.O of the Karachi Police. In about two months four sections will be trained and a number of N.C.Os. It is not possible to instructinstruct more than two sections atonce. The N.C.Os will afterwards be able to teach the rest of the police* 7. The Bahrain Fort, which is probably over two centuries old, has become in a very bad state of repair. A large section of the outside wall suddenly collapsed and several places inside are in a precarious condition. Drastic and expensive repairs are required which cannot be carried out at present owing to lack of funds. It has been necessary also to repair the married lines which should be en larged when money is available. The police are encouraged to marry and their sons, of suitable age, attend the government school which is close to the Fort. 8. The artesian well inside the Fort was deepened as the supply of water has always been insufficient. The additional water is now utilised to cultivate ground on the east of the Fort where it will be possible to grow vegetables for the police and the prison. 9. The Government is acquiring a building at Hedd, through a mortgage held by the govern ment, which is to be made into a permanent police station. Previously the police were housed in two open shops in the main street which were very unsuitable for the purpose. They require a build ing, which could, in case of emergency, be defended as the people of Hedd are notoriously turbulent and not always well disposed towards the government.On one occasion, in the past, they made a demons- tration against the police. Naturs. 10. The work of the naturs (town watchmen) under the Amirs has been very satisfactory. They have brought to light a number of cases of theft and smuggling and now that the police are Arabs, not Indians, there has been more co-operation between the two services. By degrees I hope that the naturs will become a body from whom recruits for the police can be chosen. When vacancies occur among the naturs they are now filled by men who would be suitable as police recruits when any are required. They obtain experience in police work but do no drill. The Amirs have requested that the naturs should be ordered to wear a distinctive dress, but of local type. The matter is under consideration. Crime. 11. There have unusually few serious crimes during the year and no cases of murder. Most of the matters reported by the police have been petty thefts, pickpocketing and brawling. 12. For some years complaints have been made by the villages around Manamah of thefts by a band of unknown men who in some cases used donkeys to carry away the spoil. Cows and sheep have been disappearing in large numbers. Early in the year a house at Sinabis was broken into and robbed, among other things a bag of rice was stolen. The owner of the house, an old Arab woman, discovered that the rice was6 - was leaking from the sack and followed the tracks alone to a house among the gardens near Jedhafs. Then she reported the matter to the police who surrounded the house and raided it. The upper rooms of the house were occupied by a mad man who discouraged visitors by throwing stones at them, the downstairs rooms were the head quarters and store rooms of a band of robbers who had been working evidently for several years. Two lorry loads of stolen property were removed from the house including clocks, carpets, silks, clothes, workmen f s tools etc. etc. In one room there was an armoury of Arab guns, revolvers and ammunition and a collection of keys and instru ments for opening locks. One of the gang was arrested in the house and three other members were arrested in the neighbourhood but several more men escaped to the mainland. It appeared that the valuable stolen property was sent to Qattar for sale and the less important spoil was sold in Bahrain. Quantities of bones of sheep goats and cattle were discovered in a pit in the compound. Since this case there have been no complaints of organised robberies in the villages. 13. Three cases, each of them similar, of an unusual method of thieving occurred during the year. According to local custom when people are married the bride r s family borrow jewelry and ornaments to be worn by the bride during the first week of her married life. In one case a woman in Muharraq^ borrowed ornaments valuedvalued at Rs 5,000/- from a wealthy neighbour. The ornaments disappeared. The bridegroom alleged that they had been stolen. It was found, after investigation, that he himself had stolen them and hidden them in a drain in a house in Muharraq. The locality of the stolen property was suggested by a profes sional diviner who appeared himself to be entirely innocent. In two other cases similar robberies were reported and it was found that the family had stolen the goods. 14. A case ocurred in Hedd in which a young Arab returned from the diving banks, called his sister into a room and strangled her, leaving her, as he thought, dead. The girl recovered and escaped. When the brother was arrested he stated to the police, and afterwards to the Court, that he had meant to kill the girl and thought that he had done so as an acquaintance told him that she had brought disgrace on his family during his absence. He was sentenced to five years hard labour. 15. Numerous convictions were obtained in cases of contravention of laws forbidding liquor and opium. The manufacture of arak continues and its prevention becomes more and more difficult as many of the younger members of the Ruling Family are addicted to it. The illicit importation of opium appears also to be increasing but so far the opium habit has not- 8 - not spread to the Arabs and it is used almost entirely by Persians.mmaammmMmmmm Education. § 30 !• There is little to report on this subject. Owing to financial necessity the expenditure on education was reduced in the last Budget from Rs 40,000/- to 30,000/- but in spite of this drastic reduction it has been possible to keep all the schools open and the number of students on the rolls has increased during the year from 828 to 966. The average attendance during the year was 750. Classes in some of the schools have been combined with a consequent reduction in the number of teachers. The top form of the Muharraq boys school takes lessons in Manamah and in order to save the expense of pur chasing furniture one of the classes in Muharraq occupies the school mosque as a form room. The work of education has continued as before though perhaps some of the teachers are less efficient than those who were employed during the previous year. 2. The distribution of the schools is as follows Boys. Muharraq Manamah Hedd Rafaa Alawiya Cirls. Manamah Maharaq 302 students. 248 ' 116 ” 68 ' 50 ” 108 ' 74 ” 966. enrolled. 3. Six boys from the government schools were appointed during the year as apprentice clerks in government offices. In these cases the salary commences at Rs 50/— per month. There is very great competition among the boys leaving the schools for any vacant posts in the government offices. Several locally educated boys have held such posts for some years and their work has been very satisfactory.The Bahrain government makes it a practice whenever possible to employ young men who have been educated in the government schools and this does much to encourage education. 4. The total number of teachers is 30 of which 11 only are foreigners. It is still impos sible to obtain suitable locally trained men for the higher posts in the schools or as teachers in the girls T schools. The general management of the schools is left to the Inspector of Education, Mr. Adham, who also teaches English to the top classes of the Maharraq^ and Manamah boys schools. 5. At the end of the term the school boys as usual produced a play. The one chosen was Moliere^ L T avare, preceded by an historical drama, a well known incident in Arab history. Both plays were very well acted and well produced. L’aware was adapted to suit local conditions and made very topical. Various local matters were introduced. 6. Teachers at the boys 1 schools have been ordered to teach the boys the authorised system of keeping diving accounts. Besides being an exercise in arithmetic this instruction should contribute towards improving the conditions of the diving industry. I am at present considering issuing to the schools a very short history of Bahrain which could be compiled from the material which I have already collected. The general public in Bahrain are entirely ignorant of the past history of their country. 7. If funds were available the scope of the schools could be extended and various local industries might be taught such as carpentry, metal and leather work etc. At present all the carpenters, as well asas all the masons in Bahrain are Persians. The teaching of handicrafts would be even more valuable than the education which is being given at present. Until financial conditions improve no such develop ments could be attempted. 8. The private school belonging to Haj Ibrahim al Irraiyadh continues to flourish and is attended by about 100 boys. The Persian school has recently extended its building and the American Mission school has a fair attendance. 9. There is a real desire among the parents in Bahrain for their sons to obtain an education and they are not satisfied that the boys should only learn Arabic and they constantly ask that more attention should be paid to English. It is the policy of the schools not to teach English except in the top classes. 10. It has been suggested that the growth of education in Bahrain will eventually form a semi educated class as it has in other similar countries which will disdain manual labour and failing to obtain employment will cause trouble. Social conditions in Bahrain however are somewhat different to those of other countries. The chief industry of Bahrain is the diving industry and for this work a certain degree of education, especially a knowledge of figures, is an advantage. Education in the schools, except in Manamah and Muharraq, is of the simplest description and almost all the boys attending Manamah and Muharraq schools are sons of merchants and small shopkeepers or pearl brokers and nakhudas. Most of them will in the usual way enter the business of their fathers where educationeducation will be an advantage to them. Increased literacy among the divers will defend them from being cheated in their accounts.Manamah Municipality. Revenue 1351 - Rs 55,000/- Expenditure 1351 - 60,900/- ** Revenue 1352 - Rs 55,600/- Expenditure 1352 - tis 49,400/- 1. The President of the Manamah Municipal Council, Shaikh Mohomed bin Shaikh Isa alKhalifah, was absent in Cairo for about four months at the end of the year, Khan Bahadur Abdurrehman Ziani acted as temporary President. 2. Barrett Street . This street, which runs from the Customs pier up through the bazaar has been greatly improved and has become the chief thoroughfare in the bazaar. The south end has been widened and several shops have been built by the municipality and given as compensation to people whose buildings were demolished in road widening schemes. Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz Gozaibi has built a large handsome office on the eastern side of the road, Ahmed bin Yusuf Fakhroo is build ing offices and a motor show room opposite the customs import yard and several other spacious shops and offices have recently been opened in this road. The municipality have decided to roof part of the street with corrugated iron supported on wooden beams and if this experiment is a success it will be adopted, eventually, in other parts of the bazaar. At present the roofs of the streets are made of matting, which is untidy, liable to catch fire, and in need of constant repairing. A small portion of pavement has been built, an improvement which is very useful in a road-E- road where there is so nmch motor traffic. 3. Road widening . A narrow lane in the centre of the bazaar was widened by the total removal of two shops and by reducing the depth of 11 shops, these shops although smaller than before, are now let for higher rents. About sixty feet of Government Road (the sea- road) has been widened on the south by nine feet. It was agreed when the road was built that the owners of land inside the road should allow the municipality to fill in 9 feet along their frontage. Similar work has been done on the Baladiya road, from the Government Road to the Municipal building which has been widened on one side. This road was treated with concrete and bitumen about four years ago. The work was done by a foreman from the Basrah Municipality and it has lasted extremely well; when oil can be obtained locally at a cheap price more roads can be improved in this way. A portion of Government Road opposite the Fort has been resurfaced. A road has been partly filled in west of the Suk al-Arbaa across a piece of unreclaimed water inside the Government Road. Fences were built on the Sehlah road in com pensation for owners fences which were removed when the road was widened last year and a long ditch was filled in. The Bahrain Petroleum Co. have now undertaken the upkeep of this road ana have greatly improved the surface. The Municipality were permitted by the government to cut a road through the government land opposite-3- opposite the Adviserate, a continuation of the road North and South through the town, and also to continue the inner sea road to a junction with Government Road. The government garages were removed and the remaining two plots of land were walled in. 4. Taxi stand . Owing to new buildings on the property of Khan Saheb Yusuf Kanoo it was neces sary to abandon the taxi stand, a tumble down structure of wood and matting on the North-East of the Police Station. A new one was built in the centre of the open space opposite the Custom House. The roof is of corrugated iron on wooden pillars and the building is 100 feet long and 15 feet wide. The position of the taxi stand is convenient as it is at the entrance of the Pier, in the centre of the Sea Boad and near the telephone exchange. 5. Municipal garden . The waterchannels in the garden have been cleaned out and repaired and in some cases built with cement. The western half of the garden is being planted with trees and shrubs which are irrigated from a new tank connected by a pipe to the artesian well at Masjid Al-Khawaja. The drain from the gardendown to the sea has been re-roofed and doors have been built atintervals to enable repairs to be carried out inside the drain without the necessity of opening up the whole roof. The railings and doors round the garden were painted. The municipal garden is used more every year by the people of the town who frequent it in crowds-4- crowds especially in the summer evenings. The trees are now about seven years old and afford ample shade in the hot weather. The value of property adjoining the garden has increased. 6. Tomb of Shaikh Ahmed al Fateh . This tomb, on the southern edge of the town, is where the first Khalifah Shaikh who conquered Bahrain is buried. With the approval of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad a wall was built round it by the municipality. 7. Filling in swamps . Work was carried on in filling the pits on the southern edge of the town which collect stagnant water during part of the year. About 1000 cubit feet of filling was done on what will eventually become very valuable land. The joint owners of the evil smelling piece of water between the house of Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz Gozaibi and the premises of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, on the south of Government Road were eventually compelled to commence re claiming it. A considerable part of it has now been filled in. The owners are Khan Bahadur Abdurrehman Ziani and one Yusuf Fakhroo of Muharraq. 8. Municipal nurse . A municipal nurse was employed during the year and a clinic for women and children was opened near the American Mission hospital. The nurse is a qualified midwife and was at one time employed by the American Mission in Bahrain. Free advice and treatment is given at the clinic but a charge is made for maternity cases and attendance at the houses of the patients. During the year 4,500 women'www* and children3 ? •5- children were treated and 16 confinements were dealt with. The nurse works in conjunction with the Agency Surgeon Dr. Holmes. There is great need for more work of this kind among the women in Bahrain and a government insti tution can do more good than the American Mission hospital to which many of the Arabs are deterred from going cwing to its being a religious insti tution. 9. Inspector of gold . Owing to various frauds having been discovered in the sale of gold orna ments the municipality appointed an Inspector to certify that ornaments contained the proportion of gold which they were alleged to contain. A certificate is supplied by the inspector giving particulars of weight etc. 10. New vegetable market . His Excellency Shaikh Hamad built a new fruit and vegetable market on part of his property south of the fish market. Formerly the vegetable market was in the centre of the bazaar in a very congested area which had become an unsuitable location for the sale of fruit and vegetables. The new building which is 250 ft. long and 80 ft. wide, is a covered market roofed with matting which is supported with pillars. It is near the sea and can be kept in a cleaner condition than the old market. As is the case with fish and meat^he sale of fruit and vegetables is forbidden except in the market which exists solely for this purpose. 11. Municipal legislation ! Unfortunately the coulcil reconsidered the order which was passed during the previous year regarding liability ofof landlords for the payment of municipal taxes. The old practice has now been restored and tenants are responsible for payment of municipal taxes with the result that in many cases they evade payment by vacating the buildings which they hire and leaving Bahrain without giving notice. The members of the council are mostly landlords and are therefore in favour of any measures which most * convenient to themselves. A reduction of 25$ was made in all house taxes. A tax was imposed on hawkers who are now not allowed to work unless they obtain a license to do so from the municipality. 12. Miscellaneous . Six public latrines were rebuilt. A piece of ground on the edge of the cemetery was gifted to Haj Mohomed Tyeb for the purpose of building a new mosque. The gift was approved by the government. lour bridges on the Sehlah road were rebuilt. Several shops were built by the municipality on their property. All the public artesian wells were fitted with valves and pipes according to the system laid down by the government. The water which accumulated in the swamp on the south of the town was pumped into the channel which carries it to the sea on the eastern shore of Gozabia and the stagnant pools were treated with kerosene in order to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. Repairs were carried on on a number of the roofs in the bazaar.Muharraq Municipality. Revenue ~ Rs 35,000/- Expenditure - Rs 37,700/-. The work of the Muharraq Municipality has been much curtailed owing to decrease in their revenue and has been confined mainly to small improvements in the roads, and to town cleaning. Muharraq sea road . The most important work carried out by the Baladiya was the cons truction of a sea road from the pier up to within about 60 feet of the deep water channel. It is now possible for boats to reach the end of this road at all stages of the tide and pas sengers no longer have to suffer the great inconvenience of walking some three hundred and fifty yards along a narrow slippery cause way of loose stones. The road on pier is 1023 feet in length, 23feet wide and has a stone platform at the end about 50 feet square where motor cars can turn. It is built of stone with walls of murabba and a filling of fishti stone surfaced with beaten mud. Four flights of steps exist, one at the end of the pier, two on the north wall and one on the south wall. The height of the pier, from the sea bed, varies from 10 feet to 15 feet. The cost of this building was Rs 10,000/- and this sum was subscribed by certain persons of the Siadi family in Muharraq who are trustees of 'Tilth' money and property left by deceased persons and dedicated to good works etc. It is regarded as an achievement that the BahrainBahrain government should have persuaded the trustees of these funds to give money for this purpose. Harbour improvements . The stone from the original causeway has been utilised by the municipality who constructed a mole in the sea on the north of the new pier making a shelter for the harbour from the north wind. In addition to this a large portion of what used to be an insanitary little creek running up towards the town has been reclaimed and is now very valuable property, this reclamation and the construction of the new pier has completely changed the frontage of Muharraq and besides improving its appear ance it has made it cleaner and free from smells. Artesian wells . As in Manamah the muni cipality has improved the condition of public wells by putting in pipes and valves which prevent waste and overflow of water. In spite of this the town suffers greatly from mosquitoes which breed in the water jars which are kept in the compounds of every house. The increase in Malaria in Bahrain is undoubtedly due to the increase in water from the artesian wells. A few years ago all water had to be purchased so only an absolutely necessary quantity was kept in the houses. Now water can be obtained freely from the public taps and people who used to keep one water jar in their houses now keep three or four large filled jars which are never entirely empty and which form an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. Both the municipal14 ^ -3- 49 * municipal councils have made attempts to deal with the situation but so far with small success. Road widening . Several roads, formerly inaccessible to motor traffic, have been improved by widening. The roads of Muharraq town are still very much narrower than those of Manamah but by degrees improvements are being made. Municipal taxes . The house and shop tax was reduced by l/3 owing to the present poverty of the people. municipal tax was levied on palm branches and wood which is stacked for sale on a piece of ground near the sea road which was reclaimed by the Municipality from the sea. Miscellaneous . Victims of fires in a number of cases were given financial assistance from municipal funds. A number of roofs in the bazaars were repaired. Several barasti shops were built on the municipal near property recently reclaimed #a?em the pier. The contract for town cleaning was considerably reduced with no apparent ill effects. The muni cipality contributed towards repairing the cemetery mosque. This should have been done from the 'Tilth' but none of the trustees of 'Tilth' were willing to contribute. Electric light was instal led in the municipal offices. A contribution of l/4th of the cost of the new manamah taxi stand was paid to the manamah munici pality. The two municipalities receive half of the revenue collected from motor taxes, the remain ing half is paid to the government.Judicial. During the year, 1597 cases, including new and old cases, have been dealt with by the various Bahrain Courts which is an increase of approximately 400 cases when compared to the previous year. In spite of this increase the court fees have amounted to a few rupees less than the revenue during 1351. Many of these cases were filed during the previous year, and most of the claims were for smaller amounts than the cases during 1351 or consisted of disputes regarding land or water rights which from the stand point of revenue are unsatisfactory matters. One of the most important cases which came into the court was the settlement of the estate of the late Shaikh Abdurrehman bin Abdulwahab who left property valued at about two lacs. When the estate was divided a number of disputes were settled by the court and a will which was produced by a grandson was judged to be invalid and forged. Shaikh Abdurrehman was considered to be one of the most wealthy members of the Ruling Family. His heirs consist of eight sons and a number of daughters. 3. About 250 cases are pending settlement in in the Bahrain court, and almost 120 cases are pending in the Sunni Shara Court. This court is notorious for causing delay over the cases which it deals with, a fact which is much resented by the parties who appear before the Qadis. 4. Only seven cases of appeal were filed and in the majority of these the finding of the Bahrain Court was upheld by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad. 5. Ho new regulations were issued during- 2 - 44 during the year on judicial matters but two meet ings were held and attended by the full Majlis Tajara and a number of leading men of the pearl industry to discuss various points in the diving rules which owing to the changed times require consideration. A feeling exists, especially among the leading shaikhs of the Ruling Family, that the Bahrain government should take steps to prevent the houses and property of Bahrain subjects being alienated by acquisition through foreclosure of mortgages by foreign subjects, usually Persians. During recent years a great deal of house property in Manamah and Muharraq and Hedd has changed hands in this way. 6. The Siadi case^ has not yet been completed. A few points still remain to be settled and certain matters concerning the case which were referred to the Majlis Tajara have not yet been dealt with. 7. During the year the Bahrain Court has been moved from the small room in the government office and is established in a large well ventilated court room in the building behind the government office which was acquired last year. The new court is more convenient and more suitable and in cold weather the public can be accomodated inside the court room at one end of the building. 8. Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad did not attend the court for several months towards the end of the year and no temporary magistrate was appointed to act for him.Shia Wakf department. The usual work of this department has been carried out during the year without any opposition from the public. It can be assumed that the Shia Mcf department is a recognised institution. When it was first formed there was much opposition to it from the Shia population but its value is now recognised and the work which it carries out is self evident. The financial position of the department is as follows:- Repairs to wakfs, mosques &amp; gardens 2, Purchase of date trees 1, n land 1, Drilling a well .. Departmental expenses 2, Balance outstanding, old Remissions of leases Repairs &amp;, improvements. 125 small gardens were repaired. This work usually consists of weeding and digging up the ground and changing the position of the lesser water channels which should be done every three or four years to prevent the land adjacent to the channels becoming stagnant. New date trees are planted at the same time. 3840 young date trees were planted out, some were purchased and some were obtained from tne gardens Balance from 1351 Rs ifi.4.00/- Income from matems ft TnoQnnpc- mosques Kheirat Sales Expenditure on.- Matems Matems Mosques Good works debts due to the dept. mLeases for 1353-4 Property not yet leasedgardens already under cultivation. Structural repairs were carried out in 120 mosques in 11 villages, the repairs in most cases consisted of re-roofing and repair ing walls doors and windows. Purchases . Eleven small gardens and plots of cultivation were purchased by the department. In some cases shares in property are wakf and the remaining shares are privately owned. In such cases it is the practice of the department to buy out the private owners if such action appears to be wise. Sales . With the permission of the Shia Qaady four sales were made by the department, two pieces of open ground were sold and two gardens. The prices obtained were very high, as the purchasers required them to consolidate their other holdings. The purchase price was spent *£*on buying new gardens in place of the ones which were sold. General . During the year it was found that one of the members of the council was using his position on the council to acquire money in^unsuitable way ; he resigned and an election was held in the usual way for the purpose of appointing a new member. There was some slight agitation during the election organised by the retiring member.Sunni Wakf Department. There is little to report of this department. The department has had much difficulty in collecting its rents owing to the present conditions and in many cases the department has obtained an order from the Court to dis pose of the belongings of its tenants who fail to pay their leases. Repairs to buildings . The school of Shaikh Ahmed al Mehza in the centre of the bazaar was eventually repaired after strong representations being made to the department by the government. The school enjoys a con siderable income from house property in the bazaar but for many years it has been derelict and the rents have been appropriated by certain members of the family of the original benefactor. The minaret, stairs and windows of Bin- Jamaan mosque were repaired* Several barasti houses were erected on wakf property for leading and a new office was built in the bazaar in a building which is property of the department. The mosque opposite the Political Agency was repaired and replastered. Gardens . About six hundred young date trees were planted in wakf gardens and fourteen gardens were repaired.Land Settlement Department. Sales registered 320 Gifts 12 Registration of titles 105 Transfers 3 Total revenue from above Rs 4,010/-. The revenue from this department has decreased considerably, in 1351 over Rs 5,000/- was collected in registration fees and the amount budgeted for in 1352 has not been realised. The reason for this is the decline in land values and value of house property also a falling off in the number of registrations of titles. Out of 320 sales 227 were for properties whose value was less than Rs 500/- on which a minimum fee of Rs 5/- only was paid. It is possible how ever that the prices in these sales were deli berately understated in order to avoid payment of higher registration fees by the applicants for registrations. In addition the department has issued 20 title deeds to the Wakf Department on which no fees are collected, 51 properties were sold through the Land Department by order of courts, and 11 plans and reports were submitted to the courts regarding property involved in legal disputes Only two surveyors have been employed during the year so it has been impossible to continue the survey work of the districts of Bahrain which have not yet been surveyed. The previous survey work and the detailed maps and registers of water rights etc. is of great permanent value and these records are constantly referred to by the court. It isis unfortunate that owing to necessity for economy this valuable and important work cannot be completed. Several villages including the adjacent date groves and the islands of Sitrah and Jezirah have not yet been surveyed. . Government forms . The sum of Rs 2,223/- was realised from the sale of government forms which are compulsory in the case of sanads, wakalas and diving baruas. Though these documents do not in themselves constitute any proof of the matter contained in them, and they are not registered in the government office, yet they are popular with the general public. Ground rents . The government leases plots of ground which are occupied by barasti houses. In many cases a merely nominal rent is imposed on these sites in order to establish the govern ments ownership of the land, in other cases the full value is charged. The total revenue from this source was Rs 1,52?/-. An additional Rs 227/- was obtained by sales of small pieces of ground usually to the owners of adjacent land who wished to round off their property. Fish traps . Over 300 fish traps licenses were renewed during the year. The Land Department dealt with the question of the Sitrah group of fish traps which were rendered useless owing to the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. These fish traps are the source of the supply of prawns which are■HS &gt;3- ^7 are dried and sold in the Bahrain markets. The matter was a complicated one but a settlement was eventually arrived at by which the Bahrain Petro leum company took over the leases of all the fish traps until the end of the season when the question will have to be discussed again. The value of the fish traps which were affected is in the neigh bourhood of Rs 20,000/-. Public works . No work except essential repairs has been carried out during the year. Apart from the usual upkeep of buildings the following work was done. The south wall of the customs import shed was rebuilt. A large portion of it collapsed and it was necessary to re-build it. The parapet of the wall along the sea side of the western sea road was repaired. It had been seriously damaged by boats being anchored to it. The police now have orders to prevent owners of boats from tying up alongside the wall. The married quarters at the fort were re-roofed. A portion of the government office, which was previously a veranda, was enclosed and made into an office. Owing to the great number of files and records more room had to be obtained for the clerks to work in. R.A.F. Pier . The Land Department arranged for the building of a pier 1600 feet long opposite the Royal Air Force rest house. The work was done by contract and a supervisor from the Land Department was lent to the R.A.F. to supervise the building. The contract was made before the diving season but commencement of work was delayed until after the diving so the contractor made a considerable profit.r'' Bahrain Electric Supply. tl -i. The information in this report is supplied by Mr. W. B. Steele, the State Engineer. 1. Load . The department has been adversely affected during the year by the state of trade; the returns for 1352 however show an increase of load over 1351. 2* The following extra load has been con nected during the year. 415 points making a total of 17 Kilowatts, of which 312 are light points and 103 fan and power points. Five refrigerators and three domestic water pumps have also been connected during the year, making a total of 18 Kilowatts. During the year 98 houses were wired, 83 in Manamah and 15 in Muharraq. Revenue from connected load in 1352 was Rs 30,986/8 as compared with Rs 27,462/14 in 1351. 3* Wiring contracts . Wiring for light and power has been carried out by the department, usually by contract, as during the previous year, the price per point being generally the same. It is not possible to reduce the price of wiring without incurring loss, it is being kept at the present low level in order to encourage the use of electricity. In almost every case lead covered Kaleeco wire and fittings are used as there is a local prejudice against using vulcanised India- rubber cable on porcelain cleats though the price of this system is about half the price of the Kaleeco system. The cheaper method is used exten sively in all other countries and although not so permanent it is quite safe. This year a few smallnteamBBBS^MSSSBSSSSA j2 - 2 - small shops have been wired on the cheaper system so possibly local feeling is changing, 4, Sakhir system . A complete lighting system and two Kolar lighting sets were installed by the department at His Excellency Shaikh Hamad’s country palace at Sakhir, This installation was paid for by the Bahrain Petroleum Company who presented it to His Excellency, 5, Telephone system . The use of telephones in Manamah has become increasingly popular and ten more subscribers have been added during the 3 /ear, four more applications have now been received • # making a total of 30 which is the full capacity of the exchange. The question of obtaining another 25 line exchange is under consideration but it is unlikely that this will be purchased until after six months and then only if sufficient applications are received to justify its installation. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have a telephone system at their camp connecting the wells and this will shortly have 36 lines. The company wishes to run a line into Manamah to connect up to the government exchange; an arrangement is being con sidered which should be advantageous to both parties. It would be very useful if a line could be carried over to Muharraq but the cost of this would be expensive owing to a need for a submarine cable across the deep water channel,at present, for fin ancial reasons.it cannot be installed. 6 . Municipal Ice plant . The municipal ice plant, which is inside the power house, was run successfully by the staff of the power house during 1352. rA profit was made and a longer run than usual was sustained, from 15th Muharram until 11th Rajah, owing to the age of the plant, which is 15 years old, it was necessary to purchase a number of spare parts etc. The municipal council do not appreciate the necessity for this and are inclined to consider such expenditure as unnecessary. 7. Consumption of units . As in 1351 the units were not in proportion to the number of extra points connected owing to the increasing use of low wattage Japanese lamps by the Arab consumers. It is difficult in such times as these to deter the public from using cheap lamps but their use results in a reduction in the revenue from consumption. The Japanese lamps are marked as low as 5 watts. Usually under tests these lamps take a good deal more but in any case they consume much less than the lowest wattage lamps used for ordinary lighting, which are 35 watts; these cheap Japanese lamps give very little light but their cheapness appears to outweigh their effectiveness in the eyes of the public 8 . Japanese wiring material . Owing to its dangerous nature the import of Japanese wiring material has been forbidden. It was reported on very adversely by the State Engineer as being liable to cause fire by fusing. 9. Refrigerators . The Bahrain Electric Supply department has now obtained the sole agency for International General Electric Company’s refri gerators. The majority of the machines installed in Bahrain are of this make and standardisation is advisable from the point of view of maintenance and-4- © and spares. The dollar exchange is favourable and the machines, which are very good in operation are considerably cheaper than those of European manufacture. A well known English make was tried, Electrolux, but the price was very high and the firm does not manufacture models larger than two cubic feet which is too small to be popular in Bahrain. In selling the machines the price is kept as low as is possible as the main object of the department is to increase consumption of power. At present 19 refrigerators have been installed and orders have been placed for four more. 10. Prospects for 1353 . It can be reason ably assumed that wiring will proceed during the next year at the present rate. The Wireless station of the International Communications, Ltd., is installing a 7-^ Kilowatt motor generator and by 1st June 1934, it will be ready to change over to the Bahrain system. The station is taking over the work of the temporary station erected by the Royal Air Force for their use and the use of Imperial Airways. Some additional revenue will accrue from this source. The load curve of the department has risen steadily each month since the date of starting in May 1930, though the rise has been small it has been in the right direction. The sale of electrical appliances has been fair but the department has suffered from the com petition by Japan whose electrical articles are sold at a very low price and though of inferior quality the public purchase them as they cannot afford to buy better appliances.Agriculture, 1. Rice crop . Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz Gozaibi, one of the most enterprising land owners who is more interested in agriculture than any other private individual, experimented success- fuU-y during the summer by planting rice in some rich well watered ground near Abu Zaidan which he recently acquired from Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa. About 60 pounds of Hassa seed was sown and it provided a crop of about 1250 pounds. A profit of about 20$ was made. I understand that the experiment is to repeated next year. 2* Orange cultivation . More than four dozen oranges were grown in Shaikh Hamad’s garden at Sinian. They were of very good quality and size and many of them weighing as much as between 10 - 14 ounces. A few trees died during the year as they received too much water. The irri gation presents difficulties as the trees are planted among the rows of date palms which are watered in the usual way on certain days of the week. 3. Date crop . The date crop and the market for dates were slightly better than last year and there were neither storms, disease or locusts to damage the crop. Although the area planted with date trees is steadily increasing and more dates are being grown yet the Bahrain dates are insufficient to mmet the local demand and dates are imported from Hassah and Iraq. Owners of date gardens, especially certain members of the Ruling Family, complain inces-incessantly that their tenants fail to pay their rents. In many cases this is true but the gardens are almost always leased for more than they are worth as the tenants assume that a certain proportion of the rent will be cancelled according to an old and very misleading custom. Recently the landlords have given up granting any remission with the result that most of the tenants are prosecuted in the court by the land lords at the end of the lease for recovery of rent. In most cases they are unable to pay so their houses and belongings are sold by auction by order of the Court. 4. No attempt has been made by the Govern ment during the last two years to develop the agricultural potentialities of the country, offing to lack of funds, but I am confident that there are great possibilities of improvement and expan sion in this direction. Thousands of acres of land are suitable for cultivation in areas where it is known that artesian water can be obtained. Few people grow anything except dates, lucerne and the few local fruits and vegetables which have always been cultivated here. It is now known that cotton, oranges and rice can be grown success fully in Bahrain. All of these crops have valu able possibilities. Many European vegetables grow well in Bahrain and there is an ever increas- ing demand for them as well as for different varieties of fruit, not only among the foreign population but among Arabs who have acquired a taste for them when travelling in Iraq and in India. Encouragement is needed from the governmentgovernment which should lead the way by making an experimental garden for fruit and vegetables which could be sold in the vegetable market. The government should sell seeds to owners of gardens and possibly organise competitions in garden produce. This requires time and money neither of which are available at present.General. 1. Bahrain subjects resident abroad . During the year a number of complaints were made to the Bahrain government by the Shia Bahrainis living in Qasbah on the Persian coast alleging that the Persian authorities disregarded the nationality certificates which they had obtained in Bahrain and forced them to adopt Persian nationality and to do military service. Towards the end of the year the oppression by the local authorities increased and one Bahrain subject was killed* A petition was received by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad from the leaders of the Bahraini com- minity at Qasbah* Owing to the drastic taxation which has lately been imposed on the people of Katif by the Saoudia government a number of Bahrainis long resident in Katif evaded the government authorities and fled to Bahrain. The policy of the Saoudia government has been to allow the men of Katif to come and go between Bahrain and Katif but to pre vent the women from leaving the place. During the last quarter of the year about two hundred people from Katif, men and women, escaped from Katif and returned to their villages in Bahrain. The women disguised themselves as men and in this way they were able to evade the authorities. The Bahrain community in Qasbah and in Katif consist of Shia Bahrainis who left this country some twenty years ago, or more, owing to the oppression by the Ruling Family and the Sunnis. Since then conditions have changed in Bahrain, religious toleration is accorded to all sects andand the Shias in Bahrain have now nothing to fear from the Ruler. Those Bahrainis in Katif who do not own property now wish to return to Bahrain but the Bahrainis in Qasbah wish to remain in Persia in possession of their property but retaining Bahrain nationality. This, according to Persian law, appears to be impossible. 2# Muharram celebrations . It is an interesting sign of the times that during the last four or five years each year the Muharram celebrations in Bahrain have increased. Many more people take part in the processions and each season new innovations appear. Shias from Katif and numbers of Persians visit Bahrain for the ten days of Muharram as these religious celebrations are not encouraged in their own countries. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and most of the Sunni Arabs show a remarkable degree of toleration to these demonstrations which are essentially anti-Sunni. His Excel lency Shaikh Hamad invariably lends camels and horses to take part in the procession. 3 # The -pilgrimage . There has been an increase in the number of Shias who have done the pilgrimage to the sacred cities of Iraq but very few people from Bahrain went to Mecca this year. The only person of any importance who did the pilgrimage was Shaikha Ayesha bint Mohomed, the widow of the late Ruler Shaikh Isa. The chief reason for the falling off in pilgrims from Bahrain is the increased expense and theand the taxation which is imposed on pilgrims by the Saoudia government. The Shia Bahrainis visit Mecca less than they used to since about four years ago a tomb in Mecca which was much venerated by the Shias was destroyed by the authorities in Mecca. 4. The Khalifah famil y. The deaths occurred during the year of two prominent shaikhs of the Ruling family, Shaikh Abdurrehman bin Abdulwahab and Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohomed. The former was a contemporary of Shaikh Isa and used to be known as his Wazir. For some years he had been in his second childhood. After his death there was a law suit in the Bahrain Court in riiich his eight sons contested the validity of an alleged will which was produced by one of his grandsons. The will was proved to be a forgery. The property involved was valued at about two lacs of rupees. Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohomed was a brother of Shaikh Rashid and one of the sons of Shaikh Mohomed bin Khalifah who died in exile. He was better educated than any of the Khalifah Shaikhs and took great interest in happenings outside Bahrain and in European politics. He kept in touch with outside events by taking in a number of periodicals from all parts of the world. He took no part in local affairs, beyond criticising the government. He died of diabetes which is a complaint that a great many of his family suffer from. On 4th June a son was born to ShaikhShaikh Sulman bin Shaikh Hamad who was named Isa after the late Ruler, The birth of an heir to Shaikh Sulman was regarded locally as a matter of importance. Another of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad t s sons had a son on the same day. 5. Kuwait visit . In June the Shaikh of Kuwait paid a visit to Bahrain. He was given an official reception with a guard of honour and salutes. He travelled on his new yacht. In December His Excellency Shaikh Hamad paid a short visit to Kuwait taking with him a number of his relations and many of the leading Arabs, a party of eighty people. He travelled to Kuwait and back to Bahrain on H.M.S. !, Shoreham rf . His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al Jabr re cently purchased some land in Bahrain, near the wireless station, and it is understood that he proposes to build a house on the site. 6. Anniversary celebrations . It has been decided that the anniversary of the acces sion of H. E. Shaikh Hamad shall be kept as an annual public holiday. For three days the towns of Manamah and Muharraq^ were decorated and illuminated at night. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad received visitors at the Palace where Arab dances took place and on one night he himself drove round the Manamah bazaar, visiting some of the chief merchants in tneir shops and offices. The people of ManamahManamah showed great enterprise and ingenuity in decorating buildings and streets and in arrang ing electric lights on various buildings. His Excellency^ action in visiting the bazaar was much appreciated and he received a great ovation from the crowds which had assembled there from all parts of the islands. Although there was no compulsion it was noticeable that every house, even the smallest huts, displayed some sort of flag or decoration. 7. Postage stamps. The question of a surcharge on the stamps used from Bahrain, which was originally suggested by me some five years ago, was finally decided and from 8th August 1933 stamps were issued bearing the surcharge 'Bahrain n . The surcharge at present is not on air mail stamps. It is hoped, locally, that in the future it will be possible for the Bahrain stamps to bear a dis tinctive design such as the head of the Ruler of Bahrain. Bahrain surcharged stamps are not recognised in Persia. Recipients of letters bearing these stamps are made to pay an amount corresponding to the postage. This action of the Persian Government causes considerable inconvenience in Bahrain. Regular postal communication now exists between Bahrain and Saoudia Arabia but very little use is made of this method of communication as it is only once weekly. Persons sending letters to and from Bahrain usually send them by messenger or by the hands of a nakhuda as travellers between the two countries come and go almost every day.8. The American Mission. The medical staff of the American Mission has been increased by the addition of Dr. Thoms who is a specialist in eye diseases. A European nursing home is being built partly in the garden of the men f s hospital and partly on a small piece of ground, adjacent to the Shia cemetery, which was given to the Mission for the building. The Mission continues to maintain a school for boys and another for girls; the students at both these schools are mostly foreigners and a great pro portion of them are jews. An additional piece of ground which was given by the Bahrain government as an extension of the Christian cemetery has been walled round and new gates and repairs have been made to the old cemetery. The funds for this work were collected locally by the American Mission. 9 # Press pronoganda . There has been a decrease in the amount of press propoganda about Bahrain in the Arab and Persian news papers which is probably due to the strictness in giving visas to journalists who used frequently to visit Bahrain. The most inaccurate and mis chievous article which appeared during the year was in the Sphere' of 30th September. It is regrettable that an English newspaper of good reputation should have published an untrue and damaging description of Bahrain. 10. Counterfeit coins . At the end of 1351 a serious position was caused owing to the number of counterfeit and suspect rupees which were circulated in the bazaar. All coins were testedtested by the Bank and by government offices and shops and more than 5$ of the coins in currency were considered to be doubtful. The Bank finally accepted coins without ring ing them. Other offices did the same and the merchants followed suit. For the time being the matter has subsided but I am of the opinion that a great many false rupees are still in circulation in Bahrain. 11. R.A.F. Pier . A narrow pier, 1,600 ft. long, was built by the Royal Air Force from their Rest House into the sea. The Bahrain government assisted the R.A.F. by making arrangements for the work to be done by contract. Notices were issued calling for tenders and finally the contract was given to Haj Abdul Nebi Bushiri, a Persian merchant, who constructed the pier for Rs 19,000/—. Although it is thought that the contractor made a handsome profit other tenders far exceeded the amount for which Haj Abdul Nebi contracted. The system of work by contract and tender is not popular in Bahrain and is never practised locally. There is no regular method of measuring stone as it is always valued by boat load, and boats vary considerably. 12 # Imperial Airways * The question of the lease of the Muharraq aerodrome was settled at the end of the year. The aerodrome has been used continuously through out the year and abnormal high tides and rain have not affected it. The Bahrain government provide a police guard on all occasions when the aerodrome is used by the Imperial Airways or by the R.A.F. machines.Customs. The following report has been provided by Mr. C. deCrenier, the Director of Customs. 'In comparison with the budget estimates the Collections were. Budget head. Estimate. Actual Increase.

Total increase Rs 26,046/- decrease //o/- Net increase Rs 25,273/- It will be remembered that in Ramadhan 1351, the ninth month, thp rates of imoort duty upon 'luxury articles' was changed from vll to lolVv. and also the rate upon alcoholic liquor and tobacco was changed from 10$ to 15la.v. This change operating for three months in 1^51 could not make a marked difference in the collections; but in 1352 the effee . noticeable and would account, to some extent, for tne increase in Customs receipts.T IT mr'Srni UlkmiMt - 2 - The decrease of Rs 367/- in vehicle licenses is explained by an adjustment in the method of collecting these dues, by which a vehicle registered in the latter half of the year would pay one half of the annual tax, instead of, as pre viously, the tax for the whole year. The increase in the collections from pearling licenses is accounted for by the collection in 13b2 of a number of arrears in 1351. The decrease of Rs 406/- in craft registrations is accounted for by the prompt payments of the renewal fees in 1352 by the owners of craft, who have thus saved themselves the penalties of late fees. Since there has been no change in the rates of collection of duty during the past year, a comparison of the classified receipts may be of interest:- Comparison of receipts. 1351 1352 Steamers cargoes Rs Native craft Parcels duty Export duty 2% duty on R.E. cargo Miscellaneous fees Import yard collection 294,400/- 81,870/- 16,519/- 1,913/- 2,345/- 7.662/- 153.381/- 266,710/- 82,266/- 16,470/- 20,527/- Total Rs — 558,090/- 556,880/- In reference to the above, for 1352, the item of R.E. collec tions should be read with steamers 1 cargoes collections, since the marked increase in collections from Direct Transhipment cargo is the result of the arrangement for * overside delivery r of R.E. bag cargo in quantities of not less than one thousand bags. This arrangement is of considerable benefit to the Nejdy merchants, but the customs department suffers in the loss of the relative Import Yard Charges. There is no doubt that this arrangement is' also of assistance to the B.I.S.N.Company Ltd., m maintain ing freights to Bahrain, although it is more than probable that (if this arrangement did not exist) such cargo would be dis- charged at Dubai and thence transported # to the mainland by native craft as is now very largely the case with piece goods and tea. But unfortunately this arrangement does not assist the nindu merchants in Bahrain their trading with the mainland, since, on account of local residential restrictions there, such merchants feel that they are not afforded opportunities to compete on equal terms fcith the Nejdy merchants. It is quite likely that this position may be brought to the atten tion of Higher Authority, but from the customs point of view the arrangement ensures a simple method of collecting R.E. duty, and, it may be added from a general point of view, iairly regular employment for Nejdy native craft. Moveover, it should be noticed that s.s. ’Khuzistan^ a British Tanker steamer operating from Abadan, does an extensive business in the sale, by overside delivery, of A.P.0.,Coy s products r transfer to the mainland by native craft. Although the collections of export duty (on dates and shells) in any year are small, the marked decrease in 1352 is to be-3- 70 to be noticed. The explanation is that on 1st April 1933 there occurred a violent, almost cyclonic storm, which ruined fully one third of the date blossoms; and the harvest in Bahrain and the mainland suffered accordingly. In this storm the heaviest rainfall in Bahrain— 2.78 inches — was recorded. Other collections are consistedt* The decrease in the collections from steamers 1 cargoes may be explained by (a) the increase in the import of cheaply produced Jananese goods, and (b) a decrease in the value of general com modities.

Tne local tendency is to build larger pearling craft than heretofore. The working of the Khammas system (under which the grant of sanad for payment of license aues is permittedjhas proved to be very difficult, and it is suspected that a number of craft are sold to out side neighbouring ports with the intention of evading the payment of the local pearling licenses. in unfortunate accident occurred in December last, when in a sudden sauall a Bahrain craft proceeding hither from '■'atif, was capsized, and its crew of eight persons witn our passengers were lost. t Establishment.

Sir 1 have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No:20/S.F dated the 4th iluharram 1353 (the 18tn April 1934) from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government forwarding the Budget Estimates of the Bahrain Government for tne year 1353 and the Administration Report for the year 1352. 2. The expenuiture of tne various Departments ol the Administration nas been reduced to the lowest possible level consistent witu tneir continuing their activities. 3. So credit has been shown for the royalties on o: (which should become payable at some time between the 1st January and the 31st March 1935) or for the sums whicn nave been received from the sale of Banram Government land to the Britisn Government. These stuns represent a large amount of money, but it was considered wise to omit them from the budget estimates lest they should give rise to attempts to incur new and unnecessary expenditure in the absence of tne /The Adviser.Tiie efiact ol the receipt of theee suas will be:- (a) to wipe out the deficit for which provision has oeen made, and (b) to provide a very large surplus. 4. The Adviser informs me that his Excellency Shaikh Hamad has agreed to replace from the proceecs of the sale of Bahrain Government lands the sum of Rs.50,000/- borrowed in 1352 from the reserve Fund. 5. It will be important whan the royalties begin to come in, to build up the reserve gradually to a substantial figure. £. 1 have not pressed for any reuuction in the Civil List for various reasons. In the first place, proceedings have been going on for some time for the acquisition of considerable areas of land for the use of ilia Majesty’s Government. To nave alienated the Ruling Family, at this juncture, from the Ruler to his lowliest kinsman, would have been fatal to our end, which has actually been achieved with little or no friction. The same applies to a lesser degree to the Civil Air Agree ment. Moreover, the ill-feeling which such an action would have engendered, might well have adversely affected our negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar, as it would have been a vivid example of the internal interference which he fears. in the second place, a considerable sum is being paid for Bahrain Government land, a fixed annual payment has been arranged for the Civil Aerodrome, and very much larger sums are likely to become payable in the present year from /oil3 oil royalties. In these circumstances, there is not one of the Family who would not nave resented our interference beyond measure ana with, to them, perfect reason; and the effect of their resentment would weaken our position along the Arab Littoral as well as in Bahrain itself. Finally, as revenue increases from the oil royalties ana from the recovery (even though slow) of trade, tne present high percentage of the Civil List to the revenue will be reduced. Fhe Shaikh has himself suggested a distribution in tna proportion of one-third to the Civil List and two- thirds to the Bahrain Government in the case of the oil royalties, and I hope that a convention will gradually grow up of a one-third - two-thirds uiviaion in the budget as a whole. entertaining aumanaed by custom and of poor relief falls largely on the Ruler and his Family, and that the existence of a budget at all is a remarkable achievement in a Principality of the Arab Littoral. it would be most inexpedient, ana in view of the increase in resources unnecessary, to bring upon ourselves the odium, both in Bahrain and outaiae the Island, which would be entailed by touching the private purses of the Ruling Family. 7* I do not propose to offer comment on the Report| which is interesting and useful, but would say that if and when regular funds become available from oil royalties, three it is well also to remember that the cost of the in all the circumstances I venture to think that /mattersmatters should, I venture to think, receive urgent attention: (i) the appointment of an Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, (ii) the institution of a carefully conducted campaign against malaria, and (iii) the renewal of the Bahrain Government’s steps to assist and improve agriculture tud fruit growing. i have the honour to he Sir, Your most obedient servant Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, BahrainConfidential * D.0.No:C/426-8/9.

No. 'b'V-'o/SF . 0 f 1354 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, R/Awal. ^ 1354 June 1935/ From The Financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your infor mation the Budget of the Bahrain btate for year 1354 with a report on Revenue and expenditure and the annual report for the year 1353. This is the tenth Budget which I have had the honour to prepare. 2. The financial position of the State is distinctly better than it was at the beginning of last year. Revenue from normal sources has exceeded the revenue of 1352 by approximately half a lac and the ordinary expenditure during 1352 was slightly less than the total revenue. Owing to the unexpected receipt of over one lac from sale of land to the British Government, it was possible for this government to spend Rs 30,000/- on the construction of the Manamah-Muharraa road whichwhich provided work for a great number of the local population at a time when many people were almost destitute through unemployment. This year the Budget has been balanced without raiding the Reserve Fund or utilising the balance in hand from the previous year. The budgets of 1352 and 1353 showed a deficit, and although no deficit was shown in 1351, yet at the end of the year there was a large actual deficit. The State commences the year with a reserve fund of two lacs and a balance of Rs 1,38,000/-. 3. The 1354 Budget . Revenue . Customs receipts continue to be the main source of revenue. I have estimated the revenue from Customs at a slightly higher figure than in 1353 budget. The estimate for 1353 was Rs 5,50,000/- including vehicle licenses: the revenue for 1353 was Rs 6,57,000/- and for 1354, I have anticipated a revenue of Rs 5,80,000/- which is Rs 33,000/- more than the amount estimated for last year, but Rs 77,000/- less than the sum which was received last year. Taking into consideration the reduction of l/8th of the direct transhipment dues on cargo to and from the ports of Saoudia Arabia, I think that the margin of safety is sufficient and I antici pate that the Customs will yield this amount. The only possible circumstances which I can visu alise and which would drastically reduce this revenue are a European war or the total cessa tion of re-export trade which might occur if the port of Ras Tanura should be developed.4. Oil. Two trips have already been made by the oil tanker s.s. 'Rheem' and she is now on her way back to Bahrain from the far East to take another cargo of oil. I am informed that she will carry out two more trips at least in 1354. Each shipment of oil produces approximately Rs 50,000/- in royalty for the Bahrain government. In estimating the revenue from oil I include the amount which is now owing to the government on the two shipments which have^ready been made and 1 have assumed that there will be two more shipments only during 1354. I think it is most probable that the number of ship ments will exceed my expectations. 5. When the Bahrain Petroleum Company obtained an extension of the Prospecting License in 1352 an agreement was made between the Company and the Government according to which the Company lent to the Bahrain govern ment Rs 50,000/-. This loan was to be recovered from future royalties by instalments. The pro portion of the refund due from the Bahrain government on the amount of royalty which I have estimated in the Budget is Rs 35,000/-, the remaining Rs 15000/- will be recovered when more royalty payments are made. 6. Other revenue . I have assessed the remaining sources of revenue at a total of Rs 55,000/- which is less than what they were expected to produce last year. The actual receipts during 1353 failed to reach the esti mate of the Budget. There was a disappointing-4- a disappointing falling off in Judicial receipts and several other items, 7. It may be observed from the various sources of revenue that the people of Bahrain are very fortunate in the matter of taxation. With the exception of customs duties, which in comparison to those of neighbouring countries, are extrenely low, there is scarcely any taxa tion. Income tax, land tax, date tree tax, zikat or ashur are not levied and the only existing house tax is the very low municipal house tax which is paid by the people of Man amah and Muharraq. In spite of this I think it can be reasonably claimed that the government of Bahrain does more for the public welfare of its people in the direction of education, justice, public security and muni cipalities than any other State in the Persian Gulf, a fact which the people themselves seem rarely to appreciate. 8.

The Civil List represents the actual amount which is paid in emoluments to the members of the Ruling Family but it does not include the allowances which are made to certain of the Ruling Family for the services which they render as Magistrates, Amirs etc. These pay ments are included under Judicial, Public Security and other headings. 9. Share in royalty amounting to Rs 55,000/- represents l/3rd of the royalty paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company to the Bahrain government. This amount is to bef K»r -5- be paid to the Privy Purse of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad. Out of this amount certain allowances which have already been paid are recoverable. The total payments which will be made during the year to the Ruling Family amount to over 50 6 &gt; of the estimated revenue. 10. State Protection . There is an increase in the cost of State Protection, this is owing to the State Police Force having been brought up to full strength in order to pro vide sufficient men for carrying out the police duties which have increased during the last year. The number of police exceeds last year T s personnel by 16 men. 11. Governm ent departments . The total estimated expenditure on government departments also shows an increase. In the year 1351 owing to the need for drastic economy the pay of the clerical and other staff, excluding persons receiving less than Rs 36/- per month, was reduced by 10^. This action was similar to that taken by other governments in other countries and at fc. was time it is necessary. I feel that the improved financial condition of the State now justifies the step of restoring part of the 10% cut and in this Budget I have provided for the restora tion of one half of the 10% cut. In England and in India, I understand that the reduction which were made have been restored in full. 12. Municipalities . The subsidies to the Manamah and Muharraq municipalities remain the same. For some years the government has considered the possibility of improving thethe conditions of Hedd which is the third largest town in Bahrain and the most unsani tary and dirty. fhe people of Hedd who are almost entirely pearl divers, are, with a few exceptions, very poor, and it is unlikely that they would at present be able to contri bute much towards a municipality. I have allocated the sum of Rs 200/- per month to be spent on cleaning the streets of Hedd and for widening the one road which is at present impassable for motor traffic. The Muharraq municipal council, with possibly two or three additional members from Hedd will deal with this work. 13. Education . An additional sum of Rs 3,500/- has been allowed for the opening of three country schools in the Shia villages. This expansion is in answer to the recent request by the Shia community that the govern ment should pay more attention to the education of the Shias who fom the majority of the population. 14. The remaining items of expenditure do not differ greatly from the amounts in the last year’s budget. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.Index.

Ttere has been an increase of approximately half a lac in the revenue col lected by the customs department which includes, besides customs dues, vehicle, pearling and boat licenses. This increase is explained in the report from the Director of Customs. Oil* Eight instalments of Rs 5,769/- were received during the year from the Bahrain Petro leum Company according to the Supplementary Agreement dated November 21, 1933. ins talments were paid in 1352. The total pay ment amounted to Rs 75,000/-, of which Rs 50,000/- was recoverable from future royalties. In addition to this sum the government also received Rs 20,000/-, not recoverable, being the amount payable according to the minimum royalty clause of the Supplementary Agreement. 3. Lease of aerodrome . This represents the lease of the manamah aerodrome for which two instalments, for 18 months, were paid during the year. 4. With the exception of Judicial receipts, interest on reserve, and loans recoverable, the revenue from other sources corresponds closely to that received during the last year. 5. Interest on Reserve . Interest on Reserve has fallen from approximately Rs 8,000/- to Rs 5,000/- mainly owing to the decline in rates of interest. Money which was placed on deposit in 1351, on which interest accrued in 1352 obtained a good rate, it was reinvested in 1352 at a muchmuch lower rate. The money available for investment in 1352 was Rs 2,50,000/-, the fol lowing year it was only Rs 2,00,000/-. 6. Loans recoverable . The Muharraq muni cipality owes money to the government on account of a loan made to the municipality some years ago for assistance in installing electric power in Muharraq. The amount was to be re-pa id by yearly instalments of Rs 7,700/- but this year owing to the municipality 1 s fin ancial difficulties it was agreed that only half the instalment should be refunded. 7• Sales of land to the British G-overnment . This is not normal revenue but is the proceeds of the sale of three pieces of land, two in Manamah and one in Muharraq, to the British government. The amount paid to the Bahrain government was Rs 1,96,031/-. Out of this sum, Rs 33,352/- was paid into the Privy purse of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad, this payment is not included in the report on e]spenditure. The purchase of land from private owners cost the State Rs 45,012/- and in addition to this Rs 7,000/- was paid to Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa who considered that he had a claim to all the open land in the neigh bourhood of Jufair, Rs 300/- was the cost of transferring cash to Bahrain from India. The amount which accrued to the government from the whole transaction was Rs 1,10,367/-. In addition to the financial arrangements a large amount of government land was given to the previous occupants.The Pearl Trade ana the hiving Inaustry. Cultured rearIs . In viewing the iuture with the most optimistic eye it is difficult to see any likelihood of the pearl industry reverting to its former state of prosperity. As the improvement and increased production of cultured pearls continues so the demand for real pearls decreases. When the public find that they can buy cultured pearls, which to the ordinary eye are undistinguishable from real pearls, for one thirtieth the price of genuine pearls of similar weight and appearance it is natural that they spend their money on cultured pearls. In the days when only real pearls and artificial pearls existed a pearl necklace had a certain significance, now only the owner of the necklace knows whether it is genuine or cultured. The success of the cultured pearl is not only deplored among the diving community in Bahrain, and the Gulf, but also by the impor tant jewel merchants in Aiirope. Last summer I had the opportunity of discussing the pearl industry with several leading London jewellers who all complained that they had been severely hit by the cultured pearl. Although the important firms do not display cultured pearls in their shops yet they told me that they were reluctantly compelled to keep cultured pearls in stock as so many of their clients demanded them. London jewellers used to make good0 \ 10 - 2 - gooa profits from selling pearls. Eost of this profit is lost ana in aaaition there is a constant aanger of being cheated. The necessity of examining every pearl which is purchased in a pearl testing apparatus is troublesome ana costly; there are still very few of these machines in Lonaon ana the fee for testing pearls is high. There is still however a market for real pearls especially in maia ana the ii,ast. It seems that the wealthy Indian personages ana princes are still interesteu only in tiie real article. The competition of the culturea pearl has scarcely affected the seed pearls and small pearls. It is possible that the Japanese find that it is not worth cultivat ing these grades. The price of ,r b&gt;herin rr and 'Naim” during the last season was not lower than the year before. 4* The id5a season . The most significant fact of the last season was that only &lt;340 boats went out to the banks instead of 4d6 which was the total number diving during the previous season. a decrease of ^6 boats out of a total of 426 is very serious. It does not follow that the reduction in the number of divers was quite in proportion to the decrease in boats because in many cases indi vidual boats carried more men. 5. I have as usual examined the accounts of th? diving clerks m order to arrive at an estimate of the value oi the catch. in the case of boats whose accounts are not made upi&lt;*r 11 &amp; -z- up by the clerks i have taken the available 1‘igures as a basis on which to take an average lor the boats whose figures are not obtainable, it should, be remembered that my figures are only approximate and they represent the rockbottom prices of the pearls which change hands many times before they leave Bahrain each time increas ing the price of the pearls. Unfortunately 1 only began to examine these accounts a few years ago, when the slump in the pearl trade began but before io47/48 the figures of the sales would have been very much higher. 6. 1 give below the particulars of the last five seasons. fear.

I do not think that this can be assumed. The .orabs in the pearl industry do not take into consideration the de crease in the number of boats. when they send out less boats the production must decrease. They also argue that the Lpiaiity of pearls has deteriorated, that fewer valuable pearls are found, in this again they do not take into con sideration the general slump in prices of pearls but they make comparisons between the season and seasons when the market was nourishing. The highest price paid for a single pearl during thethe last season was Rs 15,000/-, unfortunately this pearl was found by a boat from the main land. The largest share earned by a diver on any one boat during the season was Rs 300/- app. So The market. All the Bahrain merchants sold their new pearls. During the first month of the season the market was good, later it became dull, but the pearls were sold at a slight profit. This in itself is satisfactory. One of the chief reasons however which retards any local improvement in the industry is the large amount of capital which has been sunk in pearls which are still unsold. Most of the big local me reliant s own large quantities of pearls which they bought three or four years ago at the comparatively high prices which were then existing. They cannot now sell these pearls except at a great loss. Shaikh Mohomed Ali Zainal, ^10 used to be the leading Arab pearl dealer in the world, is now in Europe trying to sell pearls which he bought in Bahrain several years ago. He holds pearls from Bahrain which are supposed to be worth about nine lacs, they were bought from Bahrain pearl merchants on the understanding that he would pay for them as he sold them, and he is unable to sell. Last year neither he nor Mr. Pack or any of the other European buyers visited Bahrain. Until they sell their old pearls they are not in a position to buy new stock, and each year the value of undrilled pearls decreases. 9. The Divers . There has been a further increase in the number of Khammamis divers and a correspond-corresponding decrease m the number or the oelafieh. uut ot 2^2 boats whose accounts were made up by the joiving Clerks 116 were oelai'ieh and i?6 were iihaiQiiiaiiiis. in a few years, unless conditions improve, the whole diving system will change and the oelafieh system and its abuses will disappear. This would be advantageous for the divers,although they would not appreciate this, but possibly it would have an adverse effect on the pearl merchants. although divers have been severely affected by the slump in the pearl trade in one respect it has been beneficial. The naKhuuas owing to lack of money have willingly reduced the amount of the advances each year. if times had been prosperous the advances would have remained high and the divers debts would have increased. 10. The annual advances, which were settled as usual after a meeting of the leading men of the diving industry, were the same amount as the previous year. The meeting at which the Tesqam and oelaf for the new season were decided was held during the year under review and it was decided that the amounts should be reduced even lower. They were settled at Rs 20/- for a diver and --s 15/- for a puller and the usual proclama tion was issued. it was thought likely that the news of a further reduction would cause a further demonstration by the divers but nothing happened and at the time of the payments many divers agreed to accept less than the authorised amount rather than be discharged with ^baruas' releasing them to dive with other nakhudas than their own.- 6 - (tzi) 14 jj'or sometime i have made a record or the debts of divers whose books have passed through the office and i have taken the average of about 500 divers* debts. according to these figures the average diver owes to the nakhuda about Rs 507/-. This is the first time that such figures have been examined ana 1 think it is a very fair indication of the average diving debt. The list also includes eight old divers each of whom owes over ih ^uGu/- ana nine who are over IIs i,0uu/-. 11* although it is over ten years since Major ifcdy introduced the diving reforms yet still some of the nakhudas, those whose treatment of divers was most notorious in the past, try constantly to evade or to up-set the regulations, une of the new rules which was most beneficial to the divers was the one by which the heirs of the dead diver were no longer made responsible for his debt to the nakhuda. A t present some of the Maharaq nakhudas are agitating for this rule to be abolished. The protection of the interests of the divers is a thankless task^, the divers themselves do not realise that their interests are being safeguarded, they are utterly improvident and never thinks, of the future, the nakhudas and pearl merchants, with a very few exceptions, are callous and selfish and although the Kuler is sympathetic towards the divers in principle he is liable to be influenced by the arguments of the nakhudas in individual cases._ 7 . 15 12. Certain pearl merchants when discussing the state ol the trade have hinted that it might be worth considering the breeding ol cultured pearls in Bahrain. 1 think this is a dangerous suggestion, it would affect the whole (julf and it would have far reaching consequences.Police and Public Security. 1. Police strength . The total strength of the Police force at the end of the year was 172, N.C.Os and men, including two sections who are not yet fully trained. With this number of men it is possible to provide for all outside duties and guards and to retain about fifty men in training at the Fort in Manamah who would be available in case of emergency. The force is divided into 13 sections excluding the band and the headquarters staff. All the police, with the exception of three Indian instructors, are locally enlisted men but of the following nationalities:- Arabs 97 Persians 13 Shia Bahama 10 Manumitted slaves 8, the remainder include Swahilis, Sudanese, Iraqis, Yemenis, Kurds, Malabaris and Baluchis. 2. The late Superintendent of Police . During the summer, the Police Superintendent, ciied very suddenly. This officer had served in the Police since the force was originally organised by the Manamah Municipality. He was a ohia Bahrani, a very loyal, intelligent and reliable officer with a particular aptitude for investigation work. By his death the government lost a most valuable servant. After he died a certain faction of the Manamah Shia community endeavoured, in a most unsuitable manner, to secure the appointment of Haji Sulman T s son as Superintendent of police. There is in Bahrain a certain feeling that such posts as this are hereditary. The young man inin question had served for about 18 months in the police and is at present neither a suitable or capable man for the post which is one of con siderable responsibility requiring a man of age and experience. The work is now being carried on by the two senior Havildars, one of them deals mainly with the investigation of criminal cases and the other is responsible for the routine at the i?‘ort and the parades. This arrangement is, so far, satisfactory. The son of the late Superintendent is learning court work and it is proposed that he should be sent to India, if arrangements can be made, to acquire experience of Indian police methods and administration. 3. Duties . The police work generally does not vary much but one or two changes have been made during the year. It was found advisable to detail a whole section for duty in the Manamah bazaar in the day time owing to the increase in motor traffic etc. The bazaar beat was formerly provided by the naturs but the authority of the uniformed police is more effective in work of this type. 4. The police now go for a route march every Sunday and once or twice during the year all men who are available go out for several days making a complete tour of the island and camping outside various villages. The people of Bahrain are surprisingly insular; most of the police are recruited from the towns of Manamah and Muharraq and very few of them have ever been into the country beyond Manamah. The sight of the police on march with their band has a good effect on thethe country villages and also gives the men an opportunity of getting to know the geography of the island. 5. National Anthem . A number of guards of honour, usually one hundred strong, have been provided during the year on official occasions and visits of important personages. When His Excellency the Naval Commander in Chief visited Bahrain in 1934 a national anthem for the Shaikh of Bahrain was composed by the band master of the Admiral 1 s flagship. During the summer, when 1 was on leave, I arranged for the tune to be orchestrated and to be recorded on a gramophone record. Unfortunately there was some delay over this and the police band were not sufficiently acquainted with the tune to play it during the last visit of ti.M.S. 'Hawkins”. Since then they have been practising it and can now play it. The tune is slightly reminiscent of 'Rule Britannia'. It is hoped that it may be possible to borrow a bandsman from an Indian army A for a month or two in order to teach the police band which required the services of an expert. The following is an extract from the 'Daily Express' 'Travelling in a British warship # was HAMAD, Shaikh of Bahrein, a British protectorate on the Persian Gulf. He made friends with ship’s bandmaster. 'How does your national anthem go? 1 asked the bandmaster. 'I haven’t got one, J said the ohaikh.-4- (\ 2 £ 19 'I will write you one,' said Bandmaster. Did so. Difficulties arose 1. Piece was scored for trumpets, trombones, etc. Shaikh 1 s band con sists only of four bugles, four flutes, drums. 2. Shaikh's band can't read music anyway. Gramophone expert MORRIS was consulted. Recorded music suitably. Made record of it. Record despatched to Shaikh in time for Christmas. 1 have heard it. it is fine tum-ti- tiddly, Ruritanian stuff, should go well in Bahrain. Tt 6 . Lathi Drill . The instructor who came — / Karachi Police for six months to teach Lathi drill completed his time and returned to India. About half of the Police were trained by him and a number of R.C.Us were given indi vidual instruction and they are now able to complete the training of the rest of the force. No necessity for the use of lathis has so far ocurred 7. Hedd Police Post . A whole section of the police is now stationed in Redd, at the southern end of Muharraq island, as the aero drome duty is now double what it used to be owing to the increased air service. Some years ago the government took over some tumble down shops and buildings in the main street of Hedd on account of a debt. These have now been con verted into a police post building. There is accomodation for about twenty men, an office, a lock up, kitchen and wash house in a large compound surrounded by a high wall. Hedd isis a truculent town and there has been trouble there in the past. The existence of a regular police post in the middle of the town will assist the police in maintaining law and order. 8 . Manamah Fort. Constant repairs have been necessary in the Jj’ort at Manamah. At regular intervals large sections of the outer walls and the towers suddenly collapse. The whole building needs renovating. Several of the barrack rooms became dangerous during the year and instead of repairing these rooms one long new barrack room has been built inside the Fort which will accomodate about forty men. It is high and well ventilated and the men who occupy it will enjoy more healthy conditions than before. 9. Health . A drain has been dug, by prison labour, from the i?’ort to the Municipal drain which carries off the spare water from the municipal garden. This has cleared the Fort garden of all stagnant water and since this was done there has been a noticeable diminution of malaria among the police. Their health on the whole is satisfactory and their physical standard is good. When recruits are required there are so many applications that it is pos sible to pick and choose. When a few men are needed as recruits thirty or forty applicants come daily to the Fort asking to be enlisted. 10. Diving debts . A large numoer of the police are divers who owe money to the ntiKhudas. in the past only men with small debts were- 6 - were enlisted and every month they contributed Rs 5/- to their nakhuda towards the diving debt* Recently when men owing large amounts were not accepted their nakhudas agreed to cancel a large proportion of the debt provided that the divers were enlisted as police and refunded the Rs 5/- monthly. This is a significant sign of the depression in the diving industry. 11. Naturs . The strength of the naturs at the end of the year was as follows Manamah 57 Muharraq 42 Budeya &amp; Rafaa 14 113. The amirs of Maramah and Muharraq and Rafaa are in charge of the naturs in these various places. In Manamah and Muharraq they are responsible for guarding the bazaar and patrolling the town during the night. This work has been carried out effectively and there have been very few cases of theft in the bazaars. The fact that the bazaars are lit by electric light makes it very difficult for the thieves to break into shops at night. 12. Bahrain Petroleum Comnanv T s naturs . According to the agreement between the Bahrain government and the oil company the government has enlisted for the company a number of watch men who have been provided by the government with rifles and some ammunition. These men act as guards over wells and in the camps. They are employed by and paid by the company. The Bahrain government is not represented at-7- 9 O at the oil camp in any way, either by a police post or by naturs. During the year there have been frequent thefts at the camps as well as a case of assault which almost caused the death of a Somali. IThen such matters have been reported, the police have investigated the cases but none of the robberies have been traced. According to the concession agreement the Bahrain government assumes certain responsibility in the case of thefts etc. The present position is unsatisfactory. The company is known to be employing a number of bad characters many of whom have served terms of imprisonment for theft and other crimes, the naturs working at the camp are under the company 1 s orders, not under orders of the government, and the nearest police post is at Sakhir and only while the Ruler is in residence. 13. Crime . Dacoity . During the second half of this year there has been a recurrence of crimes which in India would be described as dacoity. Within a few months attacks were made on the village of Zinj, about li miles east of the Manamah Portland Barbar, a big village on the Budeya road. At Zinj the house of the richest man in the village was attacked by about a dozen men armed with rifles. The house was searched and a chest containing several thou sand rupees was removed. The owner of the house, an old man, and his wife were severely beaten by the robbers and later the old man died partly as a result of the attack.The attack took place at night and although the house was in the middle of the villager as the inhabitants were unarmed nobody dared to come to the assistance of the victims. At Barbar two houses were raided by a large band of armed men in the middle of the night. The goods which were stolen were of small value. The occupants of the first house were not molested but the owner of the second house refused to open the door when ordered to do so, at which the attackers fired several shots through the door and then smashed it in. There was a fight between the villagers and the raiders, the villagers were badly beaten with butts of rifles but one of the raiders was wounded in the hand with a pruning knife. When the matter was investigated it was found that the raiders had carried a wooden chest from the village to a place on the sea shore half way between Barbar and Manamah and from the blood trail which they left it was evi dent that one of the robbers was badly wounded. The two cases are being investigated and a number of arrests have been made in connec tion with the Zinj attack. A somewhat simi lar case occurred at the end of the year when people returning from Manamah to Budeya in the evening with a donkey load of provisions were held up by two armed men, the footpads took to flight however on seeing other people coming down the road. For several years Bahrain has been free from cases of this kind although eight or-9- (rsi 2 4 1 or nine years ago they were ot' frequent occ^or- rence. There is reason to believe that the ringleaders and many of the culprits are Hassawis who slip across to the mainland after carrying out an attack. The two attacks on villages have produced a very unfortunate result locally. The bhia Bahama are thoroughly alarmed and every village has arranged a system of armed watchmen to keep off robbers, when the country people go to the gardens at night for work in the irrigation channels, they go in parties carrying rifles. This is an unsatis factory state of things as the Bahama are apt to fire off rifles at harmless people thinking that they are robbers. 14. Muharraq murder . A well known prostitute of Muharraq was murdered, sewn up in a sack and thrown into the sea. The cause of the murder was jealousy between the frequenters of two TT Dars Tf which can be described as clubs patro nised by persons of bad character. The case^s^ fully investigated and the police were satis fied that the murder had been done by certain persons but the actual ia evidence was insuf ficient to obtain a conviction. The suspects were all foreigners from the mainland and they were repatriated to their country. 15. bitrah murder . At the end of the year a murder took place in bitrah, one Bahrani shot another Bahrani through the head with a rifle. The cause of the quarrel was jealousy over a woman of bad character who lived in the same village. The murderer was tried by the Bahrain- 10 - ^yV 25 '?2 Bahrain Court and sentenced to death. 16. Arms ana ammunition . In connection with the attacks on zdnj and Barbar the police carried out several searches o! villages and while this was being done it was discovered that a very large percentage of the popula tion are in possession of rules and ammuni tion. 1 estimate, roughly, that there are between two and three thousand serviceable rifles in the possession of the Bahama villagers and probably an even greater pro portion in the arab villages such as nafaa, Ziellag and Budeya. Although the import ot forearms is for bidden by Lroaty there is no law forbidding the possession of firearms m Bahrain. I have reason to suppose that firearms are being smuggled into Bahrain from the mainland. I have discussed the question with His jsxcei- lency shaikh Hamad and his brothers and they are in favour of a system of registration such as in force in most other countries, it is proposed to issue a proclamation stating that all rifles mu&amp;kT be registered, they will be stamped and numbered and the transfer of rifles will be forbidden. i am confident that legislation on these lines will contri bute to reduce the number oi crimes by armed men.Judicial 1. uhauges m the Bahrain Courts . The noticeable falling off in court fees collected by the Bahrain Court during tbe year is jjartiy owing to the present state of poverty and partly i think owing to the aisorganisation in the Bahrain Court which finally terminated when ohaikh oulman was given permission to retire from the court for a year. uuring most of the summer he presided alone while the adviser was on leave and this gave an oppor tunity to a certain section of the ohia community to organise agitation ana complaints against some of the findings of the court. Z. un ohaikh ouiman's retirement one of his younger brothers, ohaikh ^bdullah bin ohaikh Hamad, was appointed as magistrate on the Bahrain Court. ohaikh ^bduilah has the advantage of a better education than ohaikh ouiman ana in adaition to this he has several years experience on the omali Joint Court. ohaikh nbdullah seems to be very well fitted for the post, he belongs to the younger generation and has been brought up under the present regime in an atmosphere of law ana order which differs exceedingly to the conaitions before the present ruler took over control. The two generations have a very dif ferent outlook on things m general. The appoint ment of ohaikh ^bdullah is popular with the public. His place on the Juntas joint Court has been filled by ohaikh hhalifah, one of the younger sons of ohaikh Mohomed bin isa, who was educated at Beyrut University and speaks je»ngiish well. HeHe is almost the only member o±* the Khalifah family v^io has learned jiinglish. He has no previous experience of court work but he appears to be doing well. it would perhaps seem more suitable that positions such as these should be held by the elder sons and nephews of the Kuier but unfortunately most of them are entirely unsuitable and quite uneducated. $. Number of cases heard. The Bahrain courts during the year dealt with over i£uO cases, only four appeals were made from judgments and in each case judgments were upheld by the Kuier. The total amount of court fees collected was Ss 3,6Gu/- in 1B5£ the court fees amounted to 3s 18,oQG/-. Twentytwo estates are being administered by the Bahrain Court. 4. junctions of the mhram uourt. The Bahrain Court is the highest of the Bahrain government courts, the only appeal from its decisions is to the nuler himself. The court sits during three days of the week, from 3 a.m. until £ p.nu, and it deals with a great variety of cases including the following categories. a. Civil cases in which the amount involved is not less than IG 50u/The amount has recently been raised from L BhO/- to 5GG/- in order to relieve the court of some of its work. b. unminal cases except those of a trivial nature. c. Land cases which include boundary disputes, irrigation disputes and questions of water rights. d. Living cases, fish trap cases. e. inheritance.■Bchhhmhbi 2 8 6 . oases involving conLjjiicated ticcounts are referred by the court to the ‘Majlis Tijara* which also deals with certain diving cases, inheritance ana divorce cases are aeait with by the ohera courts but in every case the judgments or these advisory courts are referred back to the Bahrain Court for confirmation and promulgation. In addition to these duties the Bahrain Court examines every sale or registration of property before a title deed is issued and satisfies itself that the particulars in the title deed which is applied for are correct, although this lork is very laborious ana takes much time its eventual value will be veiy great. The systems of water rights in Bahrain is extre mely complicated ana is the subject of incessant litigation but by degrees it is being examined ana recorded. 7. The Bahrain Court acts as a rubnc Trustee in cases when the heirs apply for administration by the Bahrain uourt. The court charges no fee for administration except the original court fee which is levied on the whole estate. Bankruptcy cases are dealt with in a similar way. 8 . The Bahrain Court does not work according to any legal code or regulations, except in important criminal cases such as murder. in trying cases of this nature the court is guided by the Indian renal uode or rather by the ouaan renal uode and uoae of uriminai xroceaure which is ba-sed on the Indian renal uoae ana which is published in ^rabic. whenever possible the court rcourt appoints assessors to examine and deal with cases, especially disputes about water rights, fish traps and boundaries. It is remarkable how willing the public are to assist the courts in matters of this kind which frequently involve visits to gardens outside the towns, 9. Agitation for a code . I am confident that the public are genuinely satisfied with the normal administration of justice by the Bahrain Court as long as the court does not consist of one individual only. During last summer conditions were abnormal and the feelings of the Shia community were stirred by the deci sion of the Bahrain court in certain cases between Shia Bahama and members of the Ruling Family. Certain members of the Shia community in Manamah, who are better educated than the country people, became the leaders of a move ment which made representations to the govern ment asking for greater recognition of the Shia Bahama who form perhaps two thirds of the whole population. Among other demands they asked that a code should be drawn up for use in the Bahrain Courts which they thought would prevent the possibility of unfair treatment to Bahama. Most of their demands were reasonable and have already been dealt with to their satisfaction but the committee which is to examine the ques tion of a code has not yet begun to work owing to the absence of the Shia leader Haji Mansoor al Arayadh who is eminently suitable to represent the Shia community on the committee• I am myselfmyself entirely in favour or a code, provided that it is simple, on the lines of the oudan Code, for use in the Bahrain Court ana 1 made the suggestion myself some years ago.ohia uepartment. 31 (T2R imvenue Es 3&lt;i, 000/ - jixpenaiture Ks &lt;i8,uo0/~ There is very little to report on tile oiiia waicf iiepartment. it lias carried out its usual duties during tJie year or administering the yiatl I'unds and in improving tile wata properties, over £uuu young date trees were planted m «akt gardens, 15 mosques were repaired and certain shares in, the gardens were purchased in order to consolidate wakf property. lour gardens were the subject ol litigation in the court and were proved to be wakf. The department drilled two artesian wells, one of which was a failure, south of Manama, and obtained a water supply which was sufficient to put under cultivation a large piece o^ia-nd which was wakf property. It is likely that early in the next year there will be an election for the majiis of the wakf department. The present members have sat on it for several years and it is advisable that they should be changed occasionally. The wakf department has also been criticised by the general public who consider that during last year it paid too much attention to improving wakf gardens whose income was paid to ohaikh nbduiiah, the ohia Q,adi of Manamah. There is some foundation for this criticism.Land Department. The only survey work which has been done during the year, apart from plans for sale deeds and registration of titles, was a survey of certain areas claimed by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad and specially excluded from the area over which the Bahrain Petroleum Company hold their mining lease. These areas were surveyed by the Land Department in conjunction with the com pany^ surveyors. 2. Aerial Survey . During the year the Royal Air Force carried out an aerial survey of the whole of Bahrain, excluding Muharraq which has already been photographed from tbs air. This work was done at the request of the Bahrain government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the latter are interested in obtaining a record of land under cultivation at the begin ning of the Mining Lease and the aerial re photo graph was the best method of registering the cultivation. The cost of the survey will be paid for by the Bahrain government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company, each paying half. When time and money permit the Land Department will link up their own survey work, which includes almost all the cultivated area in Bahrain, with the aerial map which is to be produced. This will be a very valuable record combining boundaries, water rights etc. etc., but it will take a great v&amp; deal of work and at present there^nobody available to undertake it. 3. Registrations . There has been an increase in the number of registrations during the year and- 2 - and a corresponding increase in the revenue from this source. In the previous year total number of regis trations was 440* Increase Rs 2,770/- 4. Purchase of land bv British Government . The purchase of three large areas of land by the British government from the government of Bahrain was completed at the beginning of the year. This transaction was complicated as the Bahrain govern ment had to buy out the private owners of property within the three areas and the time available for settling the matter was very short. The private owners were paid more than the real value of their properties and they were also given grants of land in other areas by the Bahrain government. It was necessary to take this action in order to prevent a number of people considering that they had been badly treated. 5. Pish traps and government forms etc . Four hundred fish trap licenses were renewed dur ing the year but about three hundred owners have failed to renew their licenses. Revenue from ground rents and sales of small pieces of ground, usually blank alleys or corners, amounted to Rs 2,16l/-. Nearly 13,000 government forms were sold producing a revenue of Rs 1,600/-. These forms Sales registered Titles registered 354 154 Gifts Tf Wakf property 17 (free) 537 Revenue 1352 Rs 4,010/- ' 1353 6,780/--3- 3 4 ' 4( forms are used for receipts, leases and agree ments and correspond to revenue stamps bpt they are of one denomination. 6. Sitrah Fish traps . The disagreement between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the owners of fish traps which are said to be damaged by the pier at Sitrah iwwl was finally settled by mediation. A number of meetings were held in the Bahrain government office and eventually the company agreed to reduce the end of the pier and to pay a full year’s rent to all trap owners. The owners agreed to this formula, and the dispute which has lasted for about two years, has finally been settled. 7. Public Works . Manamah-Maharaq road. Cost Rs 30,500/-. Great progress has been made during the year on the bea-road and employment was provided for numbers of Bahrain subjects who were without work. It is now possible to drive a car along the sea road to a distance of about 700 yards from the Manamah end to a point where one section of the road has been entirely com pleted with parapet etc. It is difficult to describe exactly what construction has been completed during the year but it is very clearly illustrated by three photographs taken from the air through the courtesy of the Officer Command ing, No. 403 Squadron, Royal Air Force, Busrah. I hope to obtain copies of the photographs to illustrate this report. 8. Plans and blue prints of a ferry capable of carrying motor cars were obtained from the Port Director of Busrah and also from Baghdad. Tie ’Iraq government were asked whether they couldcould lend an Engineer to report on the project, but they were unable to do so. 1 sun confident that a ferry on the lines of the one described could be made in Bahrain. 9. I do not regard it as unadvisable to proceed with the work before deciding on the type of ferry. Apart from the ferry, whose main use will be to convey cars across the deep channel, the completion of the road up to both sides of the deep channel would be of very great benefit to Manamah and to Muharraq. Until a ferry exists passengers could cross in motor launches or in sailing boats. The eventual distance between the two ends of the road will be about 800 feet. If the road is completed it will take less than ten minutes to reach Muharraq from Manamah by motoring to the end of the road and crossing in a launch and com munication between the two islands will no longer depend upon tides and weather. The completion of the sea road is regarded by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad as a matter of the very greatest importance, since the work has ceased whenever I am with him he speaks about continuing the construction of the road. 10. Customs pier . Necessary repairs were carried out on the customs pier. The pierhead which is exposed to all the rough weather, was seriously damaged. It has been strengthened by an additional stone wall built from the sea bed almost*to the height of the pier extending across the head of the pier and a short distance along each side.-5- 11. Manamah Fort . Rs 2,154/-. A large new barrak room was built in the Fort capable of holding about 40 men. It is made of Tf Ferush n between solid stone pillars roofed in the usual way. The length of the room is 100 feet and the width is 21 feet. 12. Hedd police station . Rs 1,052/-. A description of this building is given in the report on the Police. 13. Other work carried out by the depart ment consisted mostly of repairs and upkeep of government buildings and gardens. No work has been done by the government on roads. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have constructed several new roads in the centre of the island and have widened and improved the road on the Rafaa hill as well as doing a great deal of work on the Manamah-Rafaa road.ManamaJi Municipality.

Municipal elections . Towards tke ena ol the year there was a municipal election ana the representative composition ol tbe council was changed in accordance to tbe request of the ohia community who recently asKea the government to increase the number of the ohia members on the municipal council* The election was carried out in the usual way, by voting. ^ list of qualified electors was shown on the municipal notice board for ten days ana members of eecd community voted on appointed days* electors appeared at the municipal oil ice in person and filieu in the voting cards winch they placed in a closed ballot box which was opened after the election in the presence ol a committee. rreviously no person was quali fied to vote unless he paid not less than Rs 8/- per annum in municipal taxes, this amount has been reduced to Rs 3/— as the general scare olBBBHUcdfiSBttSHH -2- 3 8 u of taxation has aiminisiiea auring recent years.

Eembers electea by the public are not eligible for re-eiection on the next council but the government has the right to re-eiect any members, in this case the government aia not avail itself of this right ana consequently a clean sweep has been made of the former members of the council. This somewhat arastic action was popular with the public who were becoming impatient at certain members who baa occupiea seats on the council ion so many years that they acquirea the impression that they were indispensable ana entitieu to sit on the council as a matter of course. The change cou^.d omy be made by instituting a clean sweep. ‘The composition of the new council is very representative as apart from the question of nationality it contains members of several local factions. cj. Municiuai oecretary » miring the year ali bin Hussain hhaifan, who ha a been secretary to the municipality for 8 years, was aismissea.

Work has been done on various roads within the municipal area. xl number of houses were demolished in has Roman, south east of the garden of the rolitical agency, in order to extend the road, which passes the south side of the rolitical .agency, to the sea shore where it will connect with the Mananah- Maharaq road v i&amp;unamah Government Hoad ^sea road ) has been resurfaced and widened by filling in the depression along the southern edge. This has given an additional ten feet to the road which is a valuable improvement. under a cloud. j?or some months the Head Clerk, He was transferred from the electric Department to the Municipality. His appointment to theiriiling and surfacing has been done in many other places, on rrior Hoad, on two roads which connect Government Hoad ana i^rior Hoad ana on the ralace jioad. Unfortunately it is impossible to prevent donkeys from using the roads in the town ana this invariably spoils the mua surface. 5. declaiming ground . The wrk of filling in the stagnant pools which lie opijosite the municipal building inside the government noad has been continued. These two pieces of water which are an eyesore ana a danger to the public health are the property of the Kuler and one of his sons ana there appears to be no possibility of their being filled in by the owners. Being adjacent to the fruit and fish markets they become a dump for decaying refuse. ^bout i5uu x bo feet of the swamp at the back of the town has been reclaimed by the municipality ana the remainder of the water is treated with oil at regular intervals to destroy mosquitoes. 6 . municipal Boundaries . in conjunction with the Bahrain retroleum Uompany the government constructed a series of stone boundary pillars defining the municipal boundary. oimilar action was taken in Muharraq. 7. Mn niftipai. Garden. Various improvements have been made m the municipal garden. The houses of the wild animals in the zoological section have been enlarged, the western part of the garden has been laid out and plantedwith bushes ana flowers ana the drain which carries superfluous water to the sea has been repairea* The small municipal garaen North ot the ralace was removed during the summer by order of the Kuler. It was suggested to him that mosquitoes were breeding in it although actually this was not the case. Many thousands of rupees had been spent on the garden by the municipality and it was used by the public during the summer. ivi j Rcelianeous . .&amp; wan was built at Houra to prevent the sea from destroying the low lying land near the village. He taxi stand behind the municipality was rebuilt. Municipal wells and water channels were repaired. ,'-n artesian well was constructed with the municipal drill. The pump on the edge oi the stagnant water behind the town was worKea tor several months and water was pumped to the sea. ix new municipal garage was built. Over 3uu0 houses were renumbered. The municipality took over the sale of meat during ftamadan and also sold meat during the butchers 1 strike which consequently collapsed. k tax was imposed on hawkers who were forbidden to trade without a municipal license. rx tax was imposed on coffee shops hotels ana bakers.Municipal lights were Kept on until rive hours alter sunset instead of lour hours after sunset. ‘the municipal slaughter house was repairedI Muharra^ Municii^aiity. 43 revenue tui | 00u/ “ jLXjjenaiture Ss iib,uOO/- Wo new worK ol noticeable iniijortance have been carried out during the year but the muni- cijjaiity has continued its usual programme of road widening, town cleaning and reclamation. Artesian wens . Three artesian wens were equipped with pipes taps and aaives similar to those installed by the Manamah municipality, one artesian wen was re-urined ana equipped with valves etc. Bazaar improvements . tout bazaar roots were repaired and rebuilt. eleven houses were partly demolished m order to widen roads ana some of the municipal property was repaired, xi new garage was bunt for the municipal lorry. uemeterv mosuue . The municipality, with some assistance from the public, bunt a mosque at the entrance of the muharra^ cemetery. This acts as a mortuary chapel.Education. 44 Increase in students . The progress of the Department of Education during the year has been satisfactory. The total number of students, including girls attending the government schools at the end of the year was over 1150 which is about 190 more than at the end of the previous year. The increase in the Manamah school consists mostly of boys from the Mission school and the school of Ibrahim Arayadh, the latter school is closing at the end of the school year and it is understood that the Mission school is also con templating closing down altogether. In this event it is likely that next term there will be more applications for entry to the Manamah boys school that the institution can deal with. The opposition among the Shia community in Manamah to the government boys r school which has existed for some years is now apparently subsiding as at the end of the year there were 78 Shias at the Manamah school out of a total of approximately 250 boys. New developments . Scouting has been intro duced in the Manamah and Muharraq boys* schools by two of the masters who had experience in this work in Syria. It is a popular movement and there is great competition among the boys to become scouts. On various occasions during the year they have taken part in public events and during the accession cele brations they gave an exhibition of drilling etc. The boys are not only being taught drill etc. but they learn the principles of the movement. Half ancja hour's physics! exercises is now included in the daily programme of the achoois. I think on the whole the physical condition of the boys has improved though a great cnjiy of them still suffer from skin ana eye diseases* The gins' school held an exhibition of their needle work at the end of the term dia the work which they prouucea was extremely good and would Imre found a reauy sale, but none of the students wishes to sell the work. In the opinion of the teachers the gins are on the whole more intelligent than the boys and they ieam more npiuiy. It is possible however that this is because the girls are more regular in attendance at school ana no not, as is the Case with many of the boys, leave school as soon as the diving season begins. iit the end of the year nine boys from the two top forms in the Monafflah and Muhamci schools Passed out ana obtained certificates. They are all now working, some in their fathers' offices and others in government employment.4 -agriculture. -on increasing number of -uTabs are becoming interested in agriculture and every year more lanci is being put under cultivation. in the past nothing was grown in the gardens except dates, lucerne and local vegetables but now three or four landov«ners are making experiments in growing European vegetables ana different kinds of fruit. nast year cabbages, cauli flowers and potatoes were grown locally, though in small quantities, ana sold in the bazaar where they found a ready market. Unfortunately it doesnot seem possible to grow vegetables m Bahrain all through the year, during the summer months from June till October omy local vege tables can be grown. During the year id50 fruit trees were imported into Bahrain, these included orgnges, mangoes, limes etc. The government bought a few good quality mangoes from India ana it appears that some of these are likely to produce fruit during the first year. The example of the government in planting oranges at oinaian has undoubtedly encouraged many people who own gardens to experiment in growing oranges and there is every reason to expect that the experi ment will be successful. Last year's crop from oinaian was slightly greater than the previous year and the oranges were very large ana of goou quality. Dates. uver 7,0uG young date trees were imported into Bahrain, mostly from oaouaia-^rabia, inspite of the very heavy export duty which hasBratfi -a- / 47 has been imposed on young date trees by the oaoudia-mrabia government* nast year the value of fresh and dried dates imported into Bahrain was over Rs 3 ,uO,uG\j/- so it is evident that a great many more dates couid be grown in Bahrain lor local consumption, apart from the possibility or export. it is surprising that the Bahrain gardens should produce such good dates as the date trees are not properly dealt with and are never manured. Most of the gardens belong to the Kuiing lamiiy who with a few exceptions spend no money on the upkeep or improvements of the gardens. oome years ago the trees in a section of oinaian garden were manured in the way which is pra ctised in iigypt and elsewhere, trenches were dug round the base of the trunks and filled with manure. l‘he subsequent improvement in the crops from the trees which were dealt with in this way has been noticeable. The date season ;iast year was good, the crop was not injured by storms locusts or disease, the prospects for the next season are at present unusually good. It is now over three years since the last visitation of locusts to Bahrain, before then they used to come almost every other year and they did much damage to ground crops and date trees. The number of cases brought by landlords against their tenants for failure to pay rents have been fewer during the year than usual. This ^partly because the leases have been reduced and also because landlords fine that there is4 8 is little to be gained by suing tenants who have no possible means ol paying debts, in the past all the gardens were leased by the ^rab owners to Bahama tenants, recently many landlords have stopped letting their gardens, owing to non-payment or rent, and are working them by paid labour. These labourers are always Hassawis, they are a troublesome type, notorious thieves and much bolder than the Bahama. The presence Qt large communities of Hassawis out in the Bahama vuia-ges is not very desirable, in two recent cases of urmea attacks on villages it appears that the ringleaders were Hassawis. Tobacco . x».t various times small plots of tobacco have been grown in Bahrain, usually on oitrah island. This year Hussein Tatim has planted several different kinds of tobacco at Bar bar which is growing very wen. Most of leaf tobacco in Bahrain is imported from the Batna coast. If tobacco could be grown and dried in Bahrain it would form a very useful industry. Tomatoes. Gardeners in Bahrain find that they can grow tomatoes during February, March and xxprii when apparently there is a demand for tomatoes in Ira^. This year over 8Gu crates of Bahrain tomatoes were exported to irai^ and sold at a profit. It is expected that next year the export of tomatoes win increase. Although this trade is now on a very small scale it is encouraging for the owners of gardens in Bahrain.General. Conversations with representatives of Saoudia Arabia . 4th March to 7th April 1935. During the month of March a deputation from the government of Saoudia-Arabia visited Bahrain in order to discuss various matters relating to trade and customs. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad represented the government of Bahrain and Shaikh Khalid Abu alWilaid, Shaikh Hamad alSulaiman and Haj Mohomed alAjaji were the representatives of Saoudia-Arabia. The con versations which lasted over four weeks were con ducted in a friendly spirit and resulted in an agreement which was satisfactory to both parties although the concessions which were made were entirely on the part of the Bahrain government. The Bahrain agreement will not come into force until it has been officially accepted by the government of Saoudia-Arabia. This is the first time that the Bahrain government has held direct conversations with representatives of a foreign country and although the negotiations were arranged by the British government the actual conversations took place directly between the representatives of the two countries. The Viceroy 1 s visit . in May 1934, the Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, visited Bahrain on his way from India to England by Air. A ceremonial reception was arranged on the Muharraq aerodrome, which was attended by the leading notables and members of the British and American communities. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad presented the Viceroy with a sword in a golden scabbard. The State Police provided a guard of honour, unfortunately one of the men wasyvJtY was struck by heat stroke ana alea on the same day. when the Viceroy returned to India he was received again but on this occasion the ceremony was not so formal ana the Viceroy visitea shaikh Abauiiah bin Isa^ house near the aeroarome where he drank coffee. This is the secona time in the history of Bahrain that a viceroy has visitea the islands, the previous visit was paid by nord Gurzon over 25 years ago. Imperial airways . In January i^35, the imperial airways began their double service of two nastbound and two westbound machines passing through Bahrain each week. Unfortunately owing to the times at which the aeroplanes arrive, it is not yet possible lor the general public to receive a letter on one day and to post a reply on the following day. The Imperial airways decided to give up their nesthouse in Manamah and passengers are now accomodated in tents on the aerodrome. The tents are very cola in winter and very hot in summer. Bahama agitation . the end of the summer there was some agitation on the part of the uhia Bahama which was mainiy directed against the Bahrain Court ana the ruling family. ^ series of aggravating circumstances including the action of ohaikh ^uiman on the Bahrain Court in certain cases between members of the ruling lamiiy ana the Bahama culminating in a dispute between a uhia by the camels provoked bitter feeling on either side. These conditions afforded an opportunity to some well known politically minded members of the village and the Kuier over the depredations causedI 5 -ii- the uhia community in Manankih to utilise the prevailing discontent as a means tor obtaining certain political concessions irom the government, but these concessions were really only sought by the Manamah ohias who have ^uite a different mentality to the ignorant ana inarticulate country people. jiight representatives, lour from Manamah ana four from the country, were elected by the uhia community, which consists of about two thirds of the whole population, to represent their grie vances to the government. The demands which they made were not unreasonable. They ashed that a code should be adopted in the Bahrain uourts, that there should be proportionate representation on the municipal councils, that the Manamah school should be handed bach to the uhia community and that the ohias should have more representatiwas on the Majlis Tajara. Unfortunately the beha viour of some of the petitioners ana their suppor- terse during the aiscussions which tooh place was such as might be iihely to cause a breach oi the peace. eventually however the government agreed to deal with the various points which had been raised ana the uhia community were satisfied. xl few months later the eight uhia representatives presented another letter to the Government that a third uhia „adi should be appointed by the govern ment ana that all three should sit together on one bench, as is done in the case oi the uunni ^aais. This request caused a cleavage in the ranks oi the uhias as uhaikh ^baullah bin Mohomea ualeh, the uhia Kadi m Manamah, bitterly resented the sugges tion that he should sit with any other w adis and-4- 5 2 &lt;a ana he ana his supporters organisea a counter petition repuaiating the eight representatives ana aeclaring that they were acting against the wishes or the uhia community. This was the position when the year enaed. Notable visits . The annual visit of the Naval oommanaer in Ghief, jiiast Inaies coinciaed with the celebrations or His iixceliency uhaikh Hamad*s accession aay which taKe place every year. une or the events during the three days 1 holiday was the police sports which tooK place in front or the lort. The admiral very Kindly gave permission lor the Koyai Marine Band irom H.M.o. 'Hawkins” to play on the ground during the sports, which was greatly appreciated by the public. In February 1*35, Mr. jmatchbuii-Hugesson, His Majesty*s Minister in Teheran paid a short visit to Bahrain. In February Hear admiral uive or the iirench Navy visitea Bahrain in the sloop “Bougainviiie n . In the spring uhaikh mo homea bin Isa ana some of his family riew by Imperial airways to jiuwait where they stayed lor about a month with shaikh Ahmad al Jabr. uuring the summer shaikh Mohomed bin Isa as usual paid a visit to mgypt and uyria and uhaikh Abduilah bin Isa visited .Lebanon. a number or minor ohaikhs from the Truciai Coast visited Bahrain during the year as the guests or the Kuier. training operations . A very useful work was carried out by owners oi gardens on the oouth of Manamah behind the rort. for some years these gardens have been water logged ana-5- 53 and have provided breeding places lor ot‘ mosquitoes. in addition to the danger to the public health owing to there being no drain for the surplus water the gardens themselves have suffered. On the suggestion and with the assis tance of the government the owners of the various gardens combined together and built a long water channel from the neighbourhood ol the gardens down to the sea and each garden is now connected to the mam drain by a channel. The drain had to be cut through stone in many places but the work of blasting the rock was very successlUi^arried out by the utate .engineer. The result is very satisfactory, the spare water is now carried straight down to the sea and there has been a most remarkable decrease in the numbers of mosquitoes m that area. The cost of the work is being paid for by the owners of the gardens which are allected. Butchers* strike . for more than thirty years the butchers of Manamah had the reputation ol being troublesome and truculent. They form a community in themselves and most of them are related to each other. curing the Autumn they organised a strike in order to obtain a reduction in the rents oi the stalls in the meat market. The strike lasted two or three days but it collapsed immediately when the Municipality, acting under orders ol the Government, took over the market ana sold meat to the public.5 4 Electric Supply. Annual report for year 1353, submitted by Mr. W. B. Steele, State Engineer. The current consumption for the year 1353 shows an increase of 17,208 units over 1352, partly due to an eztra connected load of 16 Kw, and partly due to a slight increase in current consumption generally, economic conditions being sonBwhat better than of late years. The following eztra load has been connected during 1353:- 330 points (16 Kw.) of vjhich 190 are light points and 140 fan points etc. Four new refri gerators were connected in Man amah. Revenue from connected load during 1353 was 36,797/- as compared with connected load during 1352, Rs 30,986/- Siztyfive premises have been wired. In Manamah 57, as compared with 83 in 1352. In Maharaq 8, as compared with 15 in 1352. Total consumers connected to date 554. Mazimum load recorded 118.2 Kw. Total kilowatts connected to date 196. Wiring contracts . Siztyfive houses only were wired during 1353, but the total number of points were more, in proportion, than of previous years, due to the houses being larger. Also the wiremen were engaged on running the new telephone line to Muharraq aerodrome, the wireless station, etc., during the year 212 light points were wired at the Old and New camps of the Bahrain Petroleum Co. Wiring outside the municipal area has been discontinued (see statement under Financial position) but this department continues to supply all necessary wiring material to the Bahrain-2- 5 5 Bahrain Petroleum Company. Ice Plant . The municipal ice plant ran from 25th Muharram to 2nd Rajah, a shorter period than usual, due to a shortage of ammonia (the suppliers having misdirected the cylinder) but the run was successful; 160 tons being made and sold at a profit to the municipality. A new freezing tank was obtained and fitted during the winter of 1353, prior to the seasons run, and the plant reinstalled. Transmissions etc. Losses . Transmission and transformer losses amount to 13.75% of the total generated as compared with 18.5% previously. This is due to the increased load and a somewhat ^better power factor during the winter months. Generating costs. Cost per unit generated allowing for depreciation were:- in 1353 - 1.39 annas per unit. 1352 - 1.41 ' The reduction is &lt;4ue to the increased load, and the allocation of a certain proportion of the wages to outside work. Also some reduction was made in the price of lubricating oil. Public telephones . The number of subscribers connected at the end of the year 1353 was 28. The rate per annum for the hire of a line telephone instrument has been reduced from Rs 150/- to Rs 125/-. The price for an extension instrument has been redueed fixed at Rs 30/- per annum. During the year a telephone line was run to Muharraq aerodrome, the deep channel crossing being made by submarine cable. ^n exchange is being installed at Muharraq. It is anticipated that a line will shortly be run to the camps of the Bahrain Petroleum Company (some-3- (some 14 miles from Manamah) where it will be connected to a 36 line exchange, for distribution in that area. The distance apart of the furthest telephorB points will then be approximately 26 miles and most of the inhabited parts of Bahrain will be within easy reach of a telephone. Financial position . It will be seen that the debit balance of Rs 19,983/- representing chiefly depreciation, is Rs 6,688/- less than the previous year due almost entirely to an increase^revenue from the sale of energy. The figures being:- A loss of something in the neighbourhood of Rs 5,000/- was sustained on wiring contracts, due to the lower ing of the charge for wiring light points. The price per point in Manamah and Muharraq was reduced from Rs 18/8 to approximately Rs 14/- and at the Bahrain Petroleum Company new camps from Rs 15/- to Rs 13/-. This ezperiuBnt was, doubtless, tried with good intent, but was not a success, fewer houses being connected than when the price was higher and the consequent loss was as shown. With the economic position as it is at present, it is inadvisable to experiment on these lines. I might add that the prices were reduced without the knowledge and Aiiring the absence of the Adviser to the G-overnment and myself. This practice also resulted in the accumulation of a great deal bf wiring stock, which is now so much dead weight. It has been decidedat any rate for the time being, to reduce the wiring staff to a minimum in Manamah and Muharraq and to discontinue wiring altogether at the Bahrain Petroleum Company camps, but continue to in 1353 1352 difference Rs — 5,810/9to supply the latter with wiring material at scheduled rates, direct. The material does not go through our stores, clearing only being done by us. Prospects for 1354 . levy little revenue can be expected from wiring contracts, unless there is an advance in trade generally, but the following additions to the electricity system will be made. Jufair. British (Gulf) Naval Base . Owing to the Gulf Naval Patrol (4 sloops) having meb- moved its base to Jufair (on the main island of Bahrain) a new Base, consisting of an Officers T Club, Clerk in Charge f s house, Canteen, Stores etc. is in course of construction. This depot will be supplied from r, D TT sub-station which is situated in H. E. Shaikh Sir Hamad’s Palace at Godhabia, and approximately If miles from the Naval depot. The connected load from this source will be, to commence with, approximately 7i Kw, and will consist of two electric water pumps, each of 2-&amp;H.P. five refrigerators, fans and lights. Eour refri gerators have been ordered for Man amah, and it may be assumed that some 300 to 400 extra light and fan points will be added during 1354. The government took over the agency of the international General Electric Company, Ltd., of America, and to date 40 refrigerators have been imported - 22 have been installed at the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s camps, and 18 have been instal led in Manamah. This is a source of revenue and in addition increases the sale of electricity in Manamah.HHHH bbbhbsbbbkh \-y° 5 8 -5- General . The maximum load was recorded in the month of Shawaal, during the anniversary celebrations of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad 1 s accession as Kuler of Bahrain, and both generating sets were called into yse for the first time since their installation. On this occasion approximately 1300 temporary lights were erected on government and public buildings and in the bazaar. The question of installing an ice storage chamber in connection with the municipal ice plant, should be seriously entertained in order that ice may be stored on days when the demand is small. At present the ice plant compressor has to work 24 hours a day for approximately five months, which is asking a great deal too much of it. It may be of interest to note that the load and revenue curves of the Bahrain Electricity undertaking have risen steadily since the station opened in Muharram 1348.63 Customs.

There is a small tariff in force upon produce brought to Bahrain by native craft. The reason for this is to ensure to the illiterate native the exact amount of duty he is called upon to pay and therefore this tariff is upon a quan titative basis. The theory of this tariff is upon a basis of five per cent ad valorem; it is open to revision from time to time. It was last revised m liiidb when the opinion was expressed that such revision should not be made too frequently, and every tenth year might be suitable. uuring the past decade the value of produce, especially foodstuffs, has considerably decreased* and therefore 1 consider it desirable to revise this tariff during the present year, and such revision will be submitted in due course upon a valuation of 5/b ad valorem.

This position coma to some extent have been aaiustea if my suggestion of imposing an import uuty of 25^ a.v. upon Japanese gooas had been put into effect, ana Bahrain money would again have gone into inhia ana u-reat Britain, as before, instead of being lost to a foreign country. while certain imports have proved useless in Bahrain, there is a noticeably markea increase in imports of cotton, woollen, silken ana leather gooas. une factor in these increases has been the aeciaration of certain monopolies in rersia, which causea gooas in transit to be lanaea at Bahrain insteaa of ifersia. Japanese gooas are inferior to British or inaian gooas, ana also they are aeteriorating in quality as comparea with previous imports, but they fina a sale because they are cheap. Japanese proaucers are not above marking their proaucts as 'British maae* nor ao their principles prevent them from selling to one purchaser at one price, a ana to a seconh purchaser at a lover price lor the same articles. consequently Bahrain merchants suffer loss by this competition.

Unfortunately oiam rice is inferior to Kangoon or Indian rice. Vehicle licenses . The collections from this source have considerably increased owing to the activities of the Bahrain petroleum uo; and also many more drivers are now licensed. The practical side of the work is done by the police who are lorced to be extremely vigilant to ensure that licenses are duly renewed, since a large number of drivers are Jrersians. leaning licenses . The collections from pearling licenses shew a marked decrease in iB5B below those of 1352. This was to be expected irom the depression in the pearl trade. Movements of steamers . uuring the year ibbb, one hundred and seventyfour steamers entered and cleared the port, as follows;- British. B.l.o.ti.

The oil tankers of the ualifornia otandard oil oomj^iny do not generally bring cargo to Bahrain, but carry the export of oil won by the Bahrain xetrox leum uompany, which is duty free. in other respects these ships are subject to the usual customs regulations etc. The above steamers brought the tallowing quan tities of cargo:- quantity y uantity landed delivered oversides 103 35 18 6 11 5 B.I.s.

Luring i 353 there was a ireight war between the B.l.o.W.Go.Ltd and certain Indian steam ship companies which accounted for the visits of the eastern uteam Navigation Oompany* s ships in the rersian Gulf. This has now ended, and it is unlikely that these ships win visit Bahrain in the coming year. The jjioyd Triestino steamers visited Bahrain as occasion offered: but i understand that in future there will be regular two monthly calls at this port. These steamers are electrically driven, are manned by Luropeans, and have reasonably good passenger accomoda tion. in general they are superior to the ‘B f type of steamer of the B.l.o.N.Goy, ntd. It is also to be noted that both the nloyd- Triestino and the Hansa steamers generally make a good anchorage within the port limits; but the British otnck steamers usually anchor at the outer buoy, which make the working of their cargoes a difficultmatter for their agents, ana increases the risk of damage. Native oraft . The collections of registra- tion fees upon the native craft show a st/i&lt;gftt increase m amount. This does not imply ^ that there are more Native uraft in Bahrain in 1353 than in 1352 — the contrary is the fact, but that owners were slow in their renewals and consequently incurred payment of late fees. A t the end of 1352 there were registered in Bahrain 1,223 craft of all kinds, including 61 motor launches. xit the end of i353,there were registered in Bahrain x,161 craft of all kin^s, including 66 motor craft. uraft whose registrations were not renewed in 1353 are accounted for as follows:-OM0&amp; (Wr -8- BaJiram sailing crait soid to otiier ^orts 71 old sailing cralt broKen ujj b4 Ola steam launeii broken up 1 mailing craft lost at sea 6 ” burnt at sea 1 tt coniiscatea in xersia Z motor craft connscated in xersia 1 Total 116 x».s an offset against tbe Bahrain craft soid to foreign ports, sailing craft ana four motor launches were brought to ana regis tered in Bahrain; ana, against the craft broken up, new sailing craft ana one motor launch were built locally, ana auiy registerea. The boatbunaing maustry is in a state of aepression, consequent Upon the depression in the pearling industry. The visits of foreign native craft to this port may be comparea as follows:- Origin Year Year i353 ^rabian mainland 610 560 nuwait 7^ io3 uman Coast 172 Persian coast odl i7u ^Iraq India 16£ 63 101 45 Africa 7 7 J.,440 i,u66 This reauction is somewhat disappointing, as it is important for the wen being of many poor people in Bahrain that the native craft traffic should be active, ana so maintain local employment. it is explained to some extent bv vi; increase m steamers 4 cargoes aue to tne reduction in the cost of freight by the B.i.o.iN.Uo., ^td., ana certain monopolies declared by the Iranian uovern- ment having hampered the cross-guif traffic, ana reaucea to practically one hail. Another factor in connection with the main land traffic is that coasting craft are Carry ing commodities landed at irbai where there is no import duty, ana consequently such gooas win be sughtiy cheaper in cost than il they were lanaea at Bahrain. lor some years there has been an opinion that native crafts carrying exports from Bahrain should carry manliests oi their cargo. it is now thought that the time is ripe for the * introduction of this system in Bahrain onuiM @ 71 -y- eillQ It IS projjosea to mitliite It as tar as the Arabian mainland ports of oaouaia-^rabia are concerned with a view to assisting such ports in their prevention oi smuggling, but 1 suggest that this procedure must be cau tiously instituted as the ^.rab na^huda v w ho is illiterate but intelligent) is apt to resent, and therefore to evade, restrictions or regulations which wouxa hamper his activities. Bahrain native craft export manuests win have to be prepared by the customs on behalf of such naKhudas, who will refuse to pay a reason able fee for same; and if the main±and ports hold the naKhudas to strict responsibility for such manifests, the native craft win visit Bahrain less and less and operate from jj'bai and oharja more and more. It would therefore seem reasonable Jhat if the native craft exporting from Bahrain are forced to bear cargo manliests, those export ing from l) l bai, oHarja and nuwait should be under the same obligation. jistabiishment . uuring the past year the number of clerks employed in the uustoms department was increased from fifteen to eighteen by the selection, after competition, of three youths from the government schools lor training as apprentices, their efforts being mainiy devoted to bin writing. consequently the licensed muqqudamage system previously in force has been abolished. ‘lUe amount of salaries drawn was £6,416/- which is greater than last year on account of automatic increases in pay. xhe number of naturs employed was £4 and the total wages paid to them was 8,6B1/-. There were d,buB Bills of i^ntry dealt with, in addition to the usual records and the statistical worK;, which is up to date. iieneral . The past year has been one of steady wording, with no unusual developments. The department is by no means over-staffed; and the changes in procedure foreshadowed in ib54, viz., the expected increase in oversides delivery cargo, and the institution of export manifests for native craft win probably entail an addition of at least three more clerks. TUh customs premises are m a bad state of dis repair, as money for necessary worK couid not be'spared during the past three years; and a large sum stasr wm have to be expended in the near future. The most urgent matters are the renewal of the Trolley-line system, which had worked wen for ten years, and the repainting of the warehouses which are suiiering badly from climatic erosion. In this connection it may be remembered that the creation of a sinking fund was recommended in iy£4; and earlier than that a small charge known as rier fees, was instituted upon impor cargo, the proceeds to be devoted to the mainr tenance and extension of the customs pier which-10- wincii ought to be twice its present length to be independent of the tines. The col lections from this source during the past six years have aggregated to &amp; 135,246/~ or say an average of Rs ^,b4u/- per year, which should more than cover the cost of maintenance and repairs of customs premises. 1 there fore suggest that the time is now suitable for the creation of this sinking fund. u 4^ 1 (u No I C/397, Political Agency, Bahrain, the 11th July 1935* In the ^umrcfiry of Receipts end Expenditure for the year 1353 on page 3 and paragraph 5 on page 5 of your Annual Report for 1353 you say that the Reserve is Rs* o ,00,000/-* In this connection will you please see your letter Noi552/SF dated the 4th ^oveicber 1934, para graph 5, and the Statement attached thereto; your letter No*706/13.L.D dated the 7th February 1935 and the Statement of Revenue and Expenditure for nine rrsonths ending Ramadhan 1353, all of which show the Reserve as Rs.3,00,000/-. 2.

No.396/S.F. Bahrain, July 15, 1935. Dear Cole, With reference to your letter No. C/397 dated July 11, 1935, enquiring about the Reserve shown in the annual account and new Budget. During 1353 we added one lac to the Reserve bringing it up to three lacs. At the end of the year, one lac of the three lacs which were invested in Fixed Deposits with the Eastern Bank, fell due. This lac was not re-invested but was paid into the current account in Bahrain, which had been reduced to Rs 27 , 000 /-. The Eastern Bank which acts as government treasury, requested the Bahrain government to increase the amount of its current account in Bahrain in return for the work which it does for the government. On receipt of oil royalties the amount on deposit account will be increased. Yours sincerely, Captain G. A. Cole, I.A., H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. %4 -i• A• CoXC'^ OmcUttng Political &gt;u;eat # ^aiTiin.
