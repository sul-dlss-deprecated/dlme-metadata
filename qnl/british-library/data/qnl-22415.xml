Visit of Danish Pishing Vessel to Persian Gulf. I regard this proposal with much misgiving. 8. If Doctor Blegrud^ fishing vessel attempts to visit the teiritoriol waters of the Arab Coast or of islands belonging to the Arab Rulers, it is certain, rightly or wrongly, to be supposed that he is after pearls. 5. I also foresee peculiar difficulties if he visits the Arab pearl banks on the high seas, v&amp;ich they look upon as their exclusive property. Our policy in the pa/t has been to regard the pearl b&lt;‘nks, the great majority of which have been fished by the ■arabs for many hundreds if not thousands of years, as pertaining to the Arabs; and we have discouraged any attempt to exploit t^iem, especially by s. e. MFP—400S&amp;P—(M-480)—26-7-34—2^00,000. mechanical means2 !&gt; mechanical means such as dredging# in spite, however, of our long established policy, the juridical position of the bams is not &lt; uite clear and our claim on behalf of the Arabs may be thought by other nations (and no doubt will by Iran) as, at any rate, open to challenge# 4# If the fishing vessel works alone, her small ship’s company may be in danger from Arabs inxious to protect their immemorial rights; while if she comes to the Arab pearl banks (even on the high seas) supported by an Iranian warship, the position would, be most embarrassing. British warships have policed the pearl banks for many years and tne appearance of what all would regard as a poacher under the protection of an Iranian warship would have most unfortunate repercussions. In any case the Arabs will look to us for protection and I think that we should be prepared to resist with the great firmness any such action by the Iranian Navy# 5# It is possible that the activities of the trawler may be harmless, but I roc*11 tales of the career of the Belgian steam yacht n Selikc jfT (afterwards ^Mozaafer”) in lool, of which a brief and colourless mention is made in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer (see Volume I pages 2247 and 2604)# I wauuic. venture to doubt whether Doctor Blegvad’s voyage wj be confined to looking xbr ordinary fish. 6, It seem to me most undesirable that the vessel * should be allowed near the Arab uittor; 1 or the Arab pearl banks on the high seas. If, however, it is deemed necessar to do so, it is sure to get about that she is a fishing boat and the local people will naturally suppose (whether the wears the Danish flag or the Iranian, especially the latter)ittter) that she is after their pearls. In the circumstance* (a) unless I am given plenty of time to v/arn the Shaikhs so that they and thtir subjects may ihlly understand and agree to vihat is being done and (b) unless I am authorised tc convey a guarantee aam on the part of Doctor Blegvad or his employees that doctor Blegvad ! s vessel will not interfere with the Arab pearl banks, I should prefer not to accept any responsibility for her safety* Lieut-Coionel, Politic, 1 Agent, Bahrain.. g -JL P P E g g , L, Z, T ,T h R.

VISIT OF DANISH FI alii LG YLS- Lu TO PZRSIM Gil In continuation of my Express letter 844-S November 14th 1^36. Visit of Danish fishing ves el to Persian Gulf. 2. I have now had an opportunity of discussing the question with the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and Political Agent, Bahrain. 3. With regard to my paragraph 2 both Captain Butler and Colonel Loch point out that even on tne high seas difficulties may arise, should Doctor Blegvad visit the Arab pearl banks. I entirely agree. 4. The pearl banks are scattered all down the Arab Coast from Kuv/ait to Has Masandam, very roughly speaking on the side of a line drawn down the middle of the Gulf, Almost all of these banks are situated on the high seas, though a few of minor importance are 'within the territorial waters of various Arab Sheikhdoms* 5. From one point of view their situation on the high seas might be held to make them open to fishing by all and sundry, but the Arabs nationals of the various Shaikhdoms concerned have, and exercise, the right of immemorial usage, and both His Majesty 1 s© Majesty*s Government and the Government of India have in the past upheld the principle that pearl banks are the property of the Arabs by discouraging at venous times foreign attempts to exploit the banks, more especially by mechanical means. 6# With regard to previous Wishing 1 * ventures, in 1901 there was the case of the Belgian steam yacht 'Seiika 1 *, afterwards ^Mossafer 11 , (see Persian Gulf Gazetteer Volume I pages 2247 and 2604)• 7. During the six months from Kovember i*hen Doctor Blegvad proposes to conduct his operations, the Arab pearlers will not be at work on the banks since, as they have no mechanical appliances such as diving suits, tney cannot dive in the cold weather. There would be nothing, however, to prevent a steam trawler from dredging for oysters# 8. If doctor Blegvad indulges in such activities, the Arabs pearlers will undoubtedly hear of it arid may take their own measures, which are likely to be drastic, for dealing with Doctor Blegvad and his trawler# The Iranian Government may hole the view that the banks are open for pearling, and in order to establish this may maize use of Doctor Blegvfed as a test case. If they apprehend, as they may, the possibility of Doctor Blegvad being menaced by the Arabs, it is possible that they may send one of their warships to escort him. 0# Except for this matter of the pearl banks on the high seas, the situation appears to be as set forth in my express letter quoted above. The two points on which definite information seems necessary are (a) what are Doctor Blegvad 1 s intentions and (b) under what flag his vessel will sail. 10# With regard to (a) I am not in a position to obtain this information myself, unless and until . Doctor Blegvad arrives in the Persian Gulf3 'Che Persian Gulf and calls either at soiae port on the Arab coast when the local Political Officer can get into touch with him and Bake discreet enquiries, or at Bushire when I can do the saiae ngrself. Doubtless, however, you will make such enquiries as you think fit. With regard to (b) it is possible that Doctor KLegvad 1 * vessel may fly the ^anish and not the Iranian flag; this might possibly depend on the terras of the charter. In this connection, I would point out that the Iranian flag would cause more irritation to the ^ab than any other. 1--* Should further enquiries show that there is danger of the Iranian U-overnment and Doctor Blegvad taking the line of action mentioned in my paragraph 8 above, I suggest for consideration whether it would not be advisable to inform the Iranian Government that His Majesty 1 s Government regard the pearl banks as the property of the Arabs of the Shaikhdoms of the Arab littoral and that therefore permission for his investigation on those banks should be obtained through His Majesty*s Government from the Shaikhs concerned. 12. I quite realise the possibility tnat Doctor Blegvad f s activities may be perfectly innocent and that these activities may be confined to Iranian territorial waters or those parts of the high seas which are not covered by the pearl banks. At the same time our experience of the Iranian Government has been such as to give cause for apprehension that any activity of theirs may result in political complications and difficulties. This being so, I have thought it advisabue to try to foresee certain specific difficulties which may arise in this case. SD/~ T.C. FOWLE, hieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

I have spoken ) to Adviser who has discussed the matter with Shaixh Abdullah Din ’Isa and ’Abdullah bin Jabber . ShaiKh Abdullah s view is that the banks are open to all even to Iranians , but obviously he had no idea in nio mind of an Iranian power trawler. Iranian boats sometimes come over ( and used to from Lingeh in particular) take part in the fishing ,victualling meanwhile from bahrain. 2 . xCuwait, Bahrain,S[atar, and the ’Oman ShaiKhdoms have an agreement not to use mechanical pearling devicesj this should be put up. o. Purthe r enquiries are being made - but my own view at present is that the banxs can be held (with the possible exception of small ones near the Iranian coast) to be the prpperty of the Arabs of the Arab Littoral , who no doubt let their Arab Iranians kins men of the Persian Littoral come to their fishing. I should be inclined to emphasize the point that it is probable that the Iranian fishers are of Arab descent and we shd try to get confirmaton of this, H.M. should find out all ne can about the Iranian boats and divers who taxe part in the fishing.
