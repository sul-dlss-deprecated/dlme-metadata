(iii) Turkish. —Five members of the Turkish delegation have left Tehran on the completion of their labours. 2. Iranian Diplomatic A ppointments. (i) Husain Ala, C.M.G., Muin-ul-Vizareh (P. in I., No. 9), till recently Iranian Minister in London, has returned to Tehran. No official announcement of his successor has yet been made. (ii) Abul Qasim Farouhar (P. in I., No. 60 (i)), Iranian Minister in Paris, has been recalled owing, it is believed, to the appearance in the French press of articles deemed insulting to the Iranian Government. (iii) Mustafa Adi, Mansur-us-Saltaneh, Iranian Minister to Switzerland, has returned to Tehran, presumably on leave. 3. The A rmy. (i) Sartip Ahmad Nakhehevan (P. in I., No. 141), Commandant of the Iranian Air Force, has been appointed Assistant to the Minister of War. Enquiries from the officer as to whether he should more correctly be styled “ Air Adviser to the Minister of War.' or whether his appointment foreshadowed those of naval adviser and military adviser, elicited, in both cases, a negative reply. The command of the Iranian Air Force has devolved on Sarhang Khosrovani, the next senior officer. (ii) According to the Turkish military attache, serious discontent among the officers of the 5th (Senneh) Division has led to the arrest of many and the replacement of all. 4. Communications. (A) Railways. —A regular daily train service is now in operation between Firuzkuh and Bandar Shah. Construction trains are running from Firuzkuh to Imanzadeh-i-Jafar. near Veramin, a distance of only 42 kilom. from Tehran. [915 bb—3](B) Road *.—According to a consular report from East Persia, the local authorities claim that the Zahidan-Kh wash-Charbar road -is now^motorable as far as a point 100 kilom. south of Bampur. .• * ; A new motor road from Zabul to Band-i-Kuhak on the Sistan—Afghan frontier has also been completed. &gt;• 5.

HIS Majesty's representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 2 for the period ending the 23rd January, compiled by the military attache to this Legation. Tehran, January 28, 1937. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 2 for the Period ending January 23, 1937. 1. Belgian Interests. His Excellency M. E. Graeffe. the newly-appointed Belgian Minister to Iran, presented his credentials to His Imperial Majesty the Shah on the 17th January. 2. Iranian Officials. His Excellency Husain Ala, C.M.G., Muin-ul-Vizareh (P. in I., No. 9), till recently Iranian Minister in London, has been appointed president of a committee for the control of the Government monopoly companies. 3. Obituary. (i) A sister of Her imperial Majesty the Queen. (ii) Nizam-ud-din Hikmat, Mushar-ud-dowleh (P. in I., No. 79), Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. 4. A merican Oil Concessions. On the 17th January a Bill was introduced into the Majlis granting two concessions, one for the exploitation of petroleum in North-East Iran and one for the construction of pipe-line to an American company known as Amiranian Oil Company. A map showing the area in which the concession is granted is attached^ 1 ) The company must, within three years of ratification, choose two provinces in East and North-East Iran, and must, within fifteen years, choose within these provinces an area, or areas, of not more than 100,000 square miles. Exploration must begin within six months, and boring within eighteen months, of ratification. The Iranian Government will receive— (a) 4s. per metric ton on petroleum sold in Iran, or exported. (b) A sum equal to 20 per cent, of the sum distributed to ordinary share holders after deduction of a sum equal to 5 per cent, of the capital invested by the company in Iran. Minimum payment of £300,000 per annum is guaranteed from the end of fifth year after concession, rising to £600,000 at end of the fourteenth year. No mention is made of any immediate cash payment. (2) The pipe-line concession provides for the constitution of a separate company known as the Iranian Pipe-Line Company of United States. This company will have the right (not exclusive) of constructing a main pipe-line in any part of Iran, provided the rights of other companies are respected, and tributary lines to connect the main line with other lines in Iran or neighbouring countries. p) Not reproduced. [940 y—-2]'1 The company’s lines may carry petroleum from wells in Iran or Afghanistan, which may belong either to the company itself, or the Amiranian Oil Company, or other companies, whether Iranian or foreign, who have the right to extract oil in Iran, such companies being known as “ the public.’’ (3) Both concessions are for sixty years. 5. British Travellers. Sir Aurel Stein, owing to illness, has abandoned all ideas of further archaeological survey in Iran this winter, and has left the country. 6. Security. An outbreak of disorder of more than usual importance is reported to have occurred during December near Zohab, on the Iraq frontier. About 200 Babajany tribesmen, who are said to have been actively engaged in smuggling and brigandage for some time past, are reported to have carried out an attack on Amnieh posts and, armed with rifles, to have inflicted serious casualties on these forces. As a result, a battalion of troops was sent from Kermanshah to the Zohab and Qasr-i-Shirin districts about the 15th December to reinforce or replace the Amnieh there. Agahi of the Kermanshah garrison is in command of the column, which hopes to quell the disturbance and to capture, if possible, the ring leaders among the tribesmen responsible for the disorders. The Babajany tribesmen in question are said to be a particularly wild section of the Jaf tribe, a large part of which is settled in Iraq, across the frontier. It is, therefore, highly likely that the tribesmen who caused the present trouble have fled into Iraq. 7. Communications. (a) Roads. —(i) It is reported that, owing to lack of funds, the scheme for making a road from Sahneh via Dina war to Sunqui (Sanghur), and thence to Hamadan, has been abandoned. (ii) The construction of a new road from Langarud to the Caspian port of Chamkaleh has been begun. (b) Railways .—Construction trains on the northern section of the Trans- Iranian Railway are running as far as Talemabad—a distance of only 22 kilom. from Tehran. 8. Prohibition of the Use of the Latin Script on Shop Signs. The police have been active in enforcing this order which was issued some days ago. 9. Earthquakes. A shock, not resulting in damage, was reported from Khoi on the 10th January, and from Hamadan on the 22nd January. 10. Military Journals. The first number of a new journal entitled Infantry appeared in January 1937. Tehran, January 23, 1937. G. D.

Seymour to Mr. Eden.—(Received March 12.) (No. 57.) HIS Majesty's representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 3 for the period the 24th January to the 13th February, 1937, compiled by the oriental secretary at this Legation. Tehran, February 16, 1937. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 3 for the Period January 24 to February 13. 1937. 1. British Officials. Major G. D. Pybus, military attache, proceeded on leave to the United Kingdom on the 6th February. He travelled via U.S.S.R. 2. British Mechanics. Four mechanics from the Hawker Aircraft Company, and one from the British Aeroplane Company, arrived in Tehran during the month for service with the Iranian Air Force. Their contract is for two years. 3. Obituary. Ali Akbar Davar (Personalities in Iran, No. 55), Minister of Finance, on the 10th February. The local newspapers give heart failure as the cause of death, but it seems certain that he committed suicide by swallowing a considerable dose of opium. As Davar was responsible for most of the recent financial and economic developments of the country and was the one man who kept the complicated system of monopolies, &amp;c., going, his death is likely to have important repercussions on future policy. Mahmoud Bader, the Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Finance, has become Acting Minister. 4. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Owing to the fact that the road from Kermanshah has been closed to oil- tanker traffic for so many days during January and the first week in February, the company found it impossible to maintain a satisfactory supply of its products in Northern Iran. Stocks of petrol and kerosene became practically exhausted not only in Tehran, but also in Meshed, Tabriz and Isfahan. The road is now open, and ample supplies are arriving. 5. The Kermanshah Petroleum Company. (i) A report from Kermanshah states that the Kermanshah Petroleum Com pany has decided to increase the number of its tank-wagons, and will probably place an order for twenty-five lorries of the Leyland type. The decision to buy British lorries is rather surprising in view of the fact that the American lorries now in use have proved satisfactory. (ii) It is reported that the company will shortly begin work on the erection of new storage tanks at Sultanabad and at Tehran. The capacity of these tanks is not known. [965 m—2]2 * 6. Communications. The roads between Kermanshah and Khosrovi and between Kermanshah and Hamadan were closed for the greater part of the month of January, owing to frequent and heavy snowstorms and severe frosts; in consequence, the volume of traffic was reduced to a very small percentage of its normal total. The Assadabad Pass was closed to all motor-vehicle traffic between the 3rd and 7th January, the 12th and 15th January and from the 21st January until the end of the month. The road from Kermanshah to Khosrovi was similarly blocked by snow between the 3rd and 8th January and the 13th and 18th January. It is reported that over 200 lorries, buses and tank-lorries were held up owing to the impassable state of the road over the Assadabad Pass, where snowdrifts 15 feet deep had been formed by strong winds. Accidents, unattended by loss of life in most cases, have been frequent, owing to vehicles skidding off the glassy surface of the roads and overturning. (ii) The construction of wide new roads, which will involve the demolition of many old buildings in the town of Kermanshah. is foreshadowed at a total cost of 3 million rials. 7. Security. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 6. A report from Kermanshah states that the operations carried out by the Iranian troops against the dissident Babajany and Ghobady tribes have been generally successful and that a large proportion of the tribesmen have surrendered. It is believed that only a small percentage of the tribesmen succeeded in escaping into Iraq. 8. The Artish. This publication has been discontinued. In future three magazines entitled Piada Nizam (infantry), Sawara Nizam (cavalry) and Tupkhaneh (artillery) are to be published and, possibly, later one for the “ Hava-Paimae ' (air force). A. C.

The foregoing report deals with Hawker machines only. 4. Communication*. Bridges. —(i) A report from Ahwaz states it is rumoured that the pillars of the new bridge are slightly affected by cracks. Although the bridge is not yet officially opened for traffic, cars and lorries pass on it. (iij The Dizful bridge is nearing completion, but the Iranian Government refuse to take the bridge over from the contractors (Santab Company) because it will be completed ahead of contract by about two months. Railways. —Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 1(b). The northern section of the Trans-Iranian Railway having reached the capital, the inauguration of this section (Tehran—Bander bhah) took place at the Tehran railway station on the 18th February in the presence of His Imperial Majesty the Shah and a large gathering. The town was bedecked with flags in celebration of the occasion. 5. A ssassina tion. On or about the 10th February, a lieutenant named Asadullah Shahbazi. having been sentenced by a military court to two years impi isonment, drew a revolver and shot the president of the military court, Colonel KhaTatbari, dead. He then fled, and tried to kill himself in the same way. He only succeeded in wounding himself, and is expected to recover. 6. Obituary.

The town was gaily decorated and the Government buildings in the city electrically illuminated. In the evening the Prime Minister gave a dinner in the Gulistan Palace to members of the Cabinet, Diplomatic Corps, officers holding high rank in the army, and members of the Turkish delegation. (ii) The usual Salaam (levee) for the Diplomatic Corps on the 21st March (Persian New Year) was not held owing to His Imperial Majesty being on tour in Khuzistan, and to the coincidence that one of the mourning days of ^lohorram fell on the same date. • (iii) All Government offices were closed for four days ending the 23rd March in celebration of the Persian New Year. 3. The Budget. (i) It is reported in the press that the budget figures for the Persian year 1316 (21st March, 1937-22nd March, 1938) are as follows :— Estimated receipts : 1,250,002,911 rials (£15,625,036). Estimated expenditure : 1,248,031,737 rials (£15,600,396).

(ii) Ahwaz-Haft Khel-Sartuk-Alkhorshid-Qaleh Tul-Izeh (Kalamir).

Tehran, June 19,1937. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 12 for the Period ending June 19, 1937. 1. The Shah. His Imperial Majesty the Shah moved from Tehran to his summer palace at Saadabad on the 13th June. On the 6th June the Deputies of the Majlis were received in audience when His Imperial Majesty expressed his satisfaction at the result of their labours during the tenth session which has just ended. 2. Security. A plot against the life of the Shah is said to have been discovered. No official communique has, of course, been issued and, in consequence, the wildest rumours and most divergent stories are current. Four junior officers are rumoured to have been shot, and arrests of more important people to have been made up to a number of twenty. Some sources give the number of those arrested as high as 600. According to the more moderate versions of the affair there would appear to have been, in fact, two plots, the first consisting merely of the propagation of Nazi doctrine and the second directed against the life of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. 3. Treaties with Turkey. The following have been ratified by the Majlis during the period under review:— (i) An establishment convention. (ii) A convention relating to security of the frontier zone and the settlement of incidents and conflicts arising in the said zone. (iii) A convention relating to judicial assistance in civil and commercial cases. (iv) A treaty of extradition and judicial assistance in criminal cases. (v) An agreement to regularise the functioning of customs. (vi) An agreement to establish improved telegraphic and telephonic communi cations. (vii) A convention relating to aerial navigation. (viii) An agreement to facilitate and increase the transport of goods and travellers by the route Trebizond-Tabriz-Tehran and vice versa. (ix) A veterinary convention. (x) A treaty of commerce and navigation. (xi) An agreement relating to the rectification of the frontier. Despite the wide field covered and the comprehensive nature of the titles of these agreements, they appear to follow stereotyped lines and little that could be described as a tangible advantage to either side is discernible. Detailed comments have been sent to the Foreign Office. [64 e—2]4. Emigration. Refugees continue to cross the Baluchistan and Iraq frontiers in numbers of approximately 100 persons per week. 5. Communications. Railways .—According to a press report, rails were laid up to a point 50 miles distant from Tehran towards Qum by the 8th June. 6. Commerce. During the period under review an exhibition of Iranian produce has been held. Vegetable and animal products, textiles, ores, metal, wood and leather work were shown. The exhibition was badly housed and the exhibits poorly staged. The Iranian press devoted much space to detailed accounts of the Shah’s visit and of his comments on the various sections. G. D.

Communications. Railways. —Considerable progress is reported in the Iranian press in railway construction on that portion (lots 14 to 17) of the Trans-Iranian Railway which lies in the Province of Iraq (Sultanabad). It is said that the embankment will be completed by December 1937, and that the laying of the rails will be begun in March 1938, and that junction with Tehran will be effected by the close of 1938. 4. Tribes. Tribal unrest is reported from the Kuhgilu and Bahmai areas. Troops amounting to a battalion have been operating in the latter area, from which 150 rifles have been collected. The Iranian Government suspects, as usual, that the tribes have been receiving arms from outside, and thinks that they may have been smuggled into the area via the gulf ports of Bandar Rig and Bandar Daylam.

In consequence (according to the rumour), the two Azerbaijan divisions will be renumbered as 4 and 5. 6. Piyada Nizam. Issue No. 6, Volume I, contains an article entitled “ Weapons and Organisation of Foreign Infantry,” described as £&lt; translated and extracted from foreign infantry journals.” Brief notices are given of— (i) A new organisation of an infantry division (United States of America), (ii) An experimental organisation of an infantry regiment (United States of America).

In a subsequent communique published under the signature of the four Foreign Ministers concerned (in which they style themselves the Council of the Eastern Entente) they pledge themselves to vote for Iran for the vacant seat on the Council of the League of Nations and to support the candidature of Turkey for a semi-permanent seat on the Council next September. 4. Bahrein. The Iranian Government has tendered a formal protest to the League of Nations and to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran against the new Bahrein fry nationality laws. 5. Exchange Control. There are persistent rumours that the Exchange Control Commission is in difficulties and that several of the restrictions are to be removed. Pressure by the Italian Legation is said to have been successful in one case in which an Italian railway contractor, unable to export his accumulated rials, has been permitted to purchase wheat for export to Italy without having to sell the resulting foreign exchange. It is said that the transaction was for the considerable amount of 20,000 tons. 6 . The Amiranian Oil Company. Mr. H. A. Warfield has been appointed delegate to Iran for administration of the affairs of this concern (see Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 4). [89 d—2]7. Shortage of Grain. A shortage of barley, green fodder and chaff in South Iran is evident from a recent order published by the military authorities there to the effect that no one may purchase any of these commodities without first obtaining a permit to do so from the military. 8 . Changes of Place Names. The small town of Dehkhargan (Degree Sheet l.G-Square l.D) has been renamed Azar Shahr. 9. Communications. Roads .—A press report states that a new road from Sabzevar to Kuchan has been completed and opened to motor traffic. This direct route, it is said, measures only 132 kilom. and effects a saving in distance of 263 kilom. as compared with the old route via Nishapur and Meshed. Gulhek, July 17, 1937. G. D.

Tehran, July 31, 1937. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 15 for the Period ending July 31, 1937. 1 . Iranian Officials. (i) ABUL QASIM FORUHAR (P. in I., No. 60 (i)) has been appointed Acting Minister of the Interior. This portfolio is in nominal charge of the Prime Minister. (ii) Musa Nuri Isfandiari, Muwaffaq-us-Saltaneh, has been appointed Director-General of the Department of Industry and Mines in place of General Jehanbani, dismissed. (iii) Sar Lashgar Amanullah Mirza Jehanbani (P. in. I., No. 94) has been dismissed and, according to some reports, placed under arrest. The causes of his dismissal are variously rumoured as :— (a) Over friendliness with foreigners, especially with the French military mission. {b) An ill-timed intervention with His Imperial Majesty the Shah on behalf of an officer suspected of disloyalty. (c) Pro-Soviet espionage by his Russian wife. (d) The explosion (resulting in several casualties) of a dump of black powder, which, though situated in the military arsenal at Sultanabad, actually belonged to, and was in charge of, the general’s department. From a study of the numerous and temporary eclipses which this astute officer has suffered in the past, it may be remarked that he usually falls on his feet, and, after a decent interval, succeeds in reinstating himself—usually in a position superior to his last. 2. Foreign Visitors — French. A press report states that a M. Andre Honorat (a Senator and ex-Minister of Public Instruction), accompanied by his wife and Professor Henri Masset (a distinguished orientalist) have arrived. M. Honorat is said to be entrusted with “ an official mission.” Presumably this mission is either cultural or designed to smooth over the recent unpleasantness with the Iranian Government over French press articles. 3. Iranian Navy. An Italian engineer has arrived at Khorramshahr to take charge of the naval workshop there. 4. Iranian Army—Troop Movements. Three hundred men of the Bandar Abbas garrison are reported to have left for Mekran. 5. Tribal. (i) Efforts by the Iranian Government to settle differences between the Ismailzais and Noruis have, so far, been unsuccessful. [89 q—2]2 /'N (ii) No recent news of events on the Azerbaijan—Kurdistan border has been received, but emigration into Iraq of the affected tribes continues. (iii) Insecurity prevails in Minab, which has been subjected to raids by armed bands of Baluchis. 6 . Communications. (i) Roads .—A consular report from East Iran states that the road to Charbar is not yet fit for heavy lorries, though light lorries can get through. (ii) The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has begun the construction of a bridge across the River Jarrahi at Khalafabad (Route 96). 7. Oil Interests. Reference paragraph 6 of Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current). Two American representatives of the American Seaboard Oil Company are prospecting for oil near Kuchan and Bujnurd on behalf of the Amiranian Oil Company. 8 . Mines. The discovery of a coat-mine near the village of Zanuz in Azerbaijan is reported in the press. Coal is in great demand in Tabriz for factories recently mncit.riiptpd G. D.

Adi has been appointed Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 3. French Interests. Reference paragraph 2 of Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), M. Andre Honorat and M. Henri Masse were received in audience by His Imperial Majesty the Shah of the 4th August. The degree of a doctor of Tehran University was conferred on M. Honorat on the 10th August. On the 9th August M. Honorat presented to His Imperial Majesty the Shah a message from the President of the French Republic and the Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour. 4. Tribal. ( 1 ) The band of brigands under the leadership of Qatch Khanum continues to flourish in the neighbourhod of Kermanshah. Her forces are said to have been recently augmented by'the arrival of fifty Babajani conscripts who have deserted from the Kermanshah garrison. No less than 500 troops are reported to be mobilised to effect the capture of the gang. (ii) A Bushire report mentions the continuance of the Iranian Government’s policy of removing tribal chiefs of the Tangistan, Dashti, and Dashistan areas to Shiras and their retention there under surveillance. 5. Iranian Navy. A Bushire report states that owing to the unreliability of the Amnieh (gendarmerie) employed on preventive duties, small detachments of naval personnel have been stationed in the gulf ports for these duties. 6 . Iranian Army. A party of Iranian officers has left for Trebizond to attend the Turkish armv manoeuvres in Thrace. [89 gg—3]2 7. Iranian Air Force. (i) At Qila Murgha Military Aerodrome on the 11 th August a machine of the “ Audax ” type caught fire and was totally destroyed. It appears that after being refuelled, a quantity of the petrol found its way into the cockpit and vapourised with the heat. A mechanic was working on the wireless equipment and caused a spark which ignited the vapour. (ii) Captain R. Walker (Messrs. Hawkers’ representative with the Iranian Air Force) left Iran on termination of his contract on the 6 th August, 1937. 8 . Piyada Nizam (Infantry Journal).

(ii) His Excellency Khalil Fahimi (P. in I., No. 58), Iranian Ambassador in Angora, who has been in Tehran for the past month, has returned to his post. (iii) His Excellency Muzaffar Alam, Sardar Intesar (P. in I., No. 10), Iranian Minister in Bagdad, who has been in Tehran for the past month, has returned to his post.

(v) Nadir Arasteh (P. in I., No. 25), has been appointed Iranian Minister in Berlin. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), paragraph 1 (iii), Seyyid Mehdi Farrukh, Motassim-us-Saltaneh (P. in I., No. 60 (ii)), has been appointed Director-General of the Department of Industries in place of Musa Isfandiari, relieved. The latter only held the appointment for a fortnight. It is rumoured that His Imperial Majesty the Shah, on the occasion of the opening of the silk factory (Intelligence Summary No. 16 (current), paragraph 1 ), was displeased that the weaving portion of the machinery was not ready to function and vented his anger on Musa Isfandiari. As he had only been appointed a few days previously, his responsibility for the hitch cannot have been very great. (ii) Haji Amanullah Ardelan, Izz-ul-Mamalik (P. in I.,No. 25(i)), Governor- General of Kerman, has been recalled to Tehran. Ibrahim Alam, Amir Shaukat-ul-Mulk, has been appointed in his place. 3.

(i) A German aeroplane arrived from Berlin in Tehran on the 18th August en route for Kabul. His Excellency Allac Navaz Khan, Afghan Ambassador in Berlin, and the German Minister were among the passengers. The machine has, it is said, left Kabul for China. The route is not known. (ii) The Bagdad Times reports that arrangements for the Polish air service (which at present terminates at Haifa) to be extended to Bagdad and Tehran as from January next have been made. The Imperial Airways superintendent in Bagdad is said to have confirmed this report. 5. Communications. (A) Railways. —Construction trains on the southern section of the Trans-Iranian Railwajr have arrived from Tehran at Anjilabad (133 kilom. from Tehran and 24 kilom. from Saveh). Only 47 kilom. remain between this point and Qum. (B) Roads. —(i) It is reported that the Iranian Government intend to repair the route Isfahan-Khunsar-Gulpaigan-Khumain and to extend it to meet the southern section of the Trans-Iranian Railway at a point south of Burujird (probably Do Rud). The same source reports that the existing service roads from Burujird and Khurramabad to Lot 8 will be kept up for communication between these two towns and the railway. (ii) Traffic is said to be fairly frequent on the Trebizond-Tabriz road. About one-third of the goods carried are of Iranian origin. Private cars can cross the Turco-Iranian frontier from Turkey and proceed to Tabriz, but the lorries of the Turkish Government bus and lorry service may not do so and must tranship their goods and passengers. The road is said to be in fair condition except for an unmetalled portion between Erzerum and the frontier. f 6 . Iranian Army. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 16 (current), paragraph 6 .

Tehran, September 11, 1937. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 18 for the Period ending September 11 , 1937. 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah moved to Tehran from his summer palace of Saadabad on the 9th September. An official denial has been made in the Iranian press of the truth of a Bagdad report that His Imperial Majesty intended to visit Iraq in March 1938. 2. The Majlis. The eleventh session of the Majlis was opened in State by His Imperial Majesty the Shah on the 11 th September. His speech, in which he made very brief reference to external and internal affairs, was much shorter than on the previous occasion. His Imperial Majesty appeared to be in the best of health. He was accompanied by the Crown Prince. 3. Iranian Officials. (i) Muwassaqi has been appointed acting Governor of Western Azerbaijan in place of Farrukh. Of Muwassaqi little is known except that he once officiated as Director of the Trade Department. (ii) Abul F'ath Doulatshahi (P. in I., No. 56) (i) has been recalled from his post of Governor-General of Ears and Ibrahim Alam (Amir Shaukat-ul-Mulk) has been appointed in his place. (iii) Qasim Sur (P. in I., No. 208), Governor of Isfahan, has been appointed Governor-General of Kerman. The appointment of Ibrahim Alam to that post (reported in Intelligence Summary No. 17) has been cancelled. 4. Tribal. A Khuzistan consular report states that the unrest among the Bamai section of the Khuzistan tribes continues. It is rumoured that the rebels have been reinforced by 150 Bakhtiaris. They have fled to the mountains with the military in pursuit. 5. Obituary. On the 3rd September, in Angora, Farrukh Khan Braghon (P. in L, No. 49). 6 . Civil Aviation. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 17 (current), paragraph 4 (ii) : The Polish Minister in Tehran denies the truth of this report and says that the presence in Bagdad of a Pole who is trying to sell light aeroplanes for private flying has probably given rise to the rumour. [139 e—X]2 (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 17 (current), paragraph 4 (i)^: The German aeroplane has not yet returned from Kabul. The German Minister s ignorance (real or feigned) of its whereabouts has given rise to a rumour that it had crashed on the Pamirs on its return journey from China. 7. Iranian Navy. A Khuzistan consular report states that an order has been issued to the effect that all naval officers must undergo six months’ training under the army in Tehran. This training will, presumably, consist of a short course at the Pcole de Guerre. 8 . Afghan Interests. General Sardar Assadullah Khan, Afghan representative at the coronation celebrations in London, has arrived in Tehran en route to Afghanistan after attending the recent Turkish army manoeuvres in Thrace. 9.

Iranian Army. (i) Manoeuvres for the Tehran garrison were carried out from the 12th to the 16th September in an area of about 100 square miles lying some 35 miles to the east of Tehran. His Imperial Majesty the Shah was present and stayed for three nights at the village of Bumehind. Aircraft participated. No invitations to foreign military attaches or civilians were issued, nor has any mention of the manoeuvres been made in the press. The Turkish military attache was not present as, at the conclusion of the recent Turkish army manoeuvres in Thrace (to which he had accompanied the Iranian army delegation) he remained in Turkey on three weeks’ leave. As on previous occasions, nearly all the civilian taxis and motor buses were commandeered by the military and a great shortage of transport in the capital resulted. (ii) Sartip Ali Ghovanlu (P. in I., No. 71) and the other Iranian officers returned to Iran from the Turkish army manoeuvres on the 23rd September. 5. Iranian Air Force. Three officers and twelve non-commissioned officers are leaving Tehran for England in the next few days for a course of instruction on the “ Hind ” machines now on order from Messrs. Hawker.

It refuelled here over night and left for Kabul and China. On the 14th September two rescue machines passed over Tehran for Kabul, and a few days later a third machine also flew over without stopping. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have received instructions to provide fuel and lubricants for six more machines in the course of the next few weeks. (ii) Instructions have been received by the de Havilland mechanics to overhaul and prepare the three “ Rapide ' machines delivered in July 1936. An unconfirmed report states that a beginning is to be made in about six weeks' time with the civil air service (for mails only) to Bagdad. 7. Communications. (a) Telephones .—An automatic telephone service has started to function in Tehran. So far only 3,000 installations are on this system. The changing over of the remainder is proceeding gradually.

Cabinet Ministers, Deputies of the Majlis and leading officials attended. 2 Iranian Officials. (i) Mahmud Bader (P. in I., No. 37 (ii)), Acting Minister of Finance since March 1937, has been confirmed in that appointment. (ii) According to the Messager de Teheran of the 26th September, the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs will pay an official visit to Angora in October and to Bagdad at the end of the same month. (iii) Owing, it is officially stated, to the increased importance of the Departments of Commerce and Industry, Ala (P. in I., No. 9) and Farrukh (P. in I., No. 60 (ii)), hitherto styled Directors-General of these two departments, have now been promoted to the rank of Minister. (iv) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), paragraph 3 (iii), Qasim Sur (also known as Qasim Sur Israfil) (P. in I., No. 208) has been appointed Governor of Gilan (and not of Kerman) in place of Saiyid Mehdi Fatimi (P. in I., No. 65) recalled. 3. Swedish Interests. His Excellency von Heidenstam, Swedish Minister, has returned to Iran from three months’ leave. 4. Industries. On the 28th September His Imperial Majesty the Shah opened the new cigarette and tobacco factory built near the old Qazvin Gate. The cost of the building was 26,054,000 rials (£325,675 at present rates), and that of the machinery 22,555,196 rials (£281,942 at present rates). Its capacity is said to be 12 i million cigarettes, 22,000 kilog. of pipe tobacco, and 8,000 kilog. of water- pipe tobacco per day. The building was the work of Skoda, and the machinery was supplied in about equal proportions by British and German firms. 5. Economic. According to a Bushire consular report, the Iranian Government has ordered a large quantity of wheat from India to relieve the situation (almost amountino- i to famine) which the over-export of wheat to Italy and Germany had created. ° I 6 Amiranian Oil Company.

This is part of a larger scheme to join Maragheh with Mianeh (Mianej) on the main Tehran-Tabriz road. 8 . Quarantine. Owing to the existence of plague in India, the Iranian Government has imposed quarantine on all ships arriving at Gulf ports from India, and especially Karachi. 9. Civil Aviation. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 (current), paragraph 6 (i), the machine which was lost has arrived in Tehran. It made a forced landing in Khotan to carry out some quite minor engine repairs, but was delayed there for five weeks as the local authorities refused to allow the crew to take off again in the absence of any permit. 10. Tribal. (i) Dashti. —The Dashti malcontents are still at large, a military force which had gone in pursuit of them having returned without accomplishing anything. (ii) Kuhgilu. —Unconfirmed reports from Shiraz and Ahwaz state that the Boir Ahmadi tribesmen in revolt against the Iranian Government number 15,000, that heavy casualties (according to one rumour as unbelievably heavy as thirty- four officers and 2,000 other ranks killed) have been suffered by the Government troops, and that reinforcements to a total of 1,500 have been sent in commandeered lorries from Shiraz, Shuster and Dizful, and 3,000 from Ahwaz to Behbehan where a tribal attack resulted in the death of the governor and casualties to the garrison. (iii) Khamseh. —There is also a vague rumour of unrest among the Khamseh of Lar, where attacks on gendarmerie posts have been made. 11. Iranian Air Force. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 (current), paragraph 5 . For Pegasus ' read “ Mercury VIII.” (ii) It is understood that the Iranian Government have placed an order with the Gloster Aircraft Company (Limited) for twenty-five Gloster “Gladiator” single-seater fighter biplanes (Bristol “Mercury VI” engine).

(iii) The five Hawker airframes now under construction at the Iranian air craft factory, Doshanteppeh, are expected to be completed by March 1938. Five de Havilland airframes have been completed and engines erected, but these machines have not been air tested up to date. (iv) Bomb-dropping practice (with dummy bombs) was carried out by the Iranian Air Force on the 2 nd, 4th and 6 th October about 50 miles north of the capital. Eighteen “ Furies ” and twelve “ Audax ” took part each day. It is reported that from an altitude of 2,000 metres some of the bombs dropped within 12 metres of the target. (v) During September two “ Tiger-Moth ” aeroplanes were badly damaged (but not irreparably so) on landing at the Mehrabad military aerodrome, the pilots of both machines escaped serious injury. 12 . Military Publications. Issue No. 9, Vol. I, of the Piyada Nizam (Infantry Journal) contains nothing of interest to the General Staff, though there is a highly diverting article on “ The superiority of the Iranian in markmanship,” with quotations from the Shahnameh in support of the contention. G. D. PYBUS, Lieut.-Colonel, Military Attache. Tehran, October 9, 1937.2 ❖ A 7. Tribal. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 20 (current), paragraph 10 (ii) and (iii). There is nothing further to report. 8 . Iranian A rmy. The Iranian army has purchased fifty Brandt 81-mm. mortars from the French firm of that name. They are to be distributed equally among the 1 st and 2nd Infantry Divisions of the Central Garrison. 9. Iranian A ir Force. (i) Following on the news (imparted by the French military attache) that the Afghan Government had ordered twenty-eight Savoia Marchetti bombers from Italy, the Turkish military attache reports that the Italians have offered to supply machines of this type to the Iranian Government. When asked if this was so, the Italian naval attache admitted the truth of the report. The Italians are said to have tried to impress upon the Iranians the advantages of buying such aircraft by claiming— {a) That they were cheaper than any machine of similar performance which any other country could supply. (b) That they had been specially designed for countries like Iran, where rough landing grounds required extra strong under-carriages and the great distances between aerodromes necessitated extra large petrol tanks. What would impress the Iranians even more would be the thought that they need not pay cash down for the machines, and if the Italians made an offer similar to that made to the Afghans, it is very likely that a deal will be concluded. In the case of the Afghans it is said that the terms are 100,000 lire per machine on delivery and the balance {i.e., about three-fourths of the price) to be paid in kind, chiefly cotton. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 20 (current), paragraph 11 (iv). Further practice was carried out on the 9th, 11 th, 13th and 16th October in the vicinity of Abdulabad. On the 17th October a display of bomb dropping and aerial gunnery took place at Abdulabad before His Imperial Majesty the Shah. His Majesty is said to have expressed his satisfaction at what he saw and granted the Iranian air force one day’s leave. G. D. PYBUS, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

Spasojevic has presented his letters of credence as Charge d'Affaires. This is the first time that his country has been diplomatically represented in Iran. There are said to be about 200 of his nationals in Iran. Most of them are employed with Italian railway construction firms on the various lots on the southern section of the Trans-Iranian Railway. 5. Hungarian Interests. The Hungarian Minister at Angora, who is also accredited to Iran, is to pay a visit shortly to present his letters of credence. There are about 200 Hungarian nationals in Iran of whom most are workmen. 6 . Finnish Interests. His Excellency Baron Aaron Yrjo Koskinon, Finnish Minister at Moscow, who is also accredited to Iran, has arrived on a visit. [164 y 2]2 7. Tribal. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 20 (current), paragraph 10 (ii) and (iii), it is reported that a tribal force is besieged on the mountains 40 miles east of Haft Khel oil-field. Operations are stationary. Local security on the main roads is said to be unaffected. No further large troop movements either to or from the affected area are reported. ^ 8 . Communications. Roads. —Owing, it is stated in the Iranian press, to agricultural development and the settlement of the tribes in Kurdistan, a large scheme for the repair of existing roads and the construction of new roads in that province has been formulated. The various projects are as follows :— (i) A new alignment between Qurveh (million sheet 2—square I.D.) and Dosar (Dizeh) (degree sheet 9.A—square 4.A) on route 86 . This has been levelled and is now being metalled. (ii) The complete repair of the route Bijar-Hamadan (route 85). (iii) The replacement of wooden bridges by stone bridges on the route Miandoab-Kermanshah (routes 68 , 61 and 74).

(v) The Dhatavand Bridge (untraceable, but probably over Ab-i-Katavan, degree sheet 2 . 1 —square 2.C) 9. Civil Aviation. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current), paragraph 4. It is rumoured that the Germans will accept the Iranian Government's terms disadvantageous as they are. 10. Treaties. The yearly quota list for the current economic year under article X of the Irano-Soviet treaty of Commerce of 1935 was signed and exchanged on the 19th October. 11. The National Bank. His Imperial Majesty the Shah is reported to have presented to the National Bank all the gold belonging to him. The press suggests that this act of Royal generosity should inspire all patriotic Iranians to sell their gold to the bank to consolidate the structure of the nation's economies.” A Bill has also been introduced in the Majlis to authorise the sale of a portion of the Crown jewels of Iran to augment the capital of the bank. 12. The Iranian Press. The two chief topics under discussion during the past fortnight have been :— (a) An article in the French paper Annates of the 15th September on the subject of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in which are stressed the enormous benefits which have accrued to Iran from the company’s activities in every sphere, and the slight measure of profit gained by the company in return. The Iranian paper Ittelast concludes a scathing review of the article with the following paragraph :— ‘ ‘ Why does the A nnales refer to the £2 million wagesbill of the com pany without mentioning the millions of tons of petrol which the company exports ? After all, is it for fun that the company pays its employees ? No! indeed it is for their labour by which it gains exorbitant sums. Apart from this, had the company not begun to exploit our petrol we ourselves would have started to do so even if a little later, and in this case, instead of receiving a royalty of approximately 20 per cent., we would have made a profit of 100 per cent.”(b) The flippant, inaccurate and occasionally malicious book of travel by H. W. and Sidney Hay, entitled : By Order of The Shah. This meretricious and jejune book, which need not be taken seriously, has roused the Iran to fury. In five long articles “Mr. Sidney Hay ' [sic] has been denounced as “an abuser of Iran’s hospitality,” “a mendacious loafer,” “ a vile caluminator,” &amp;c. 13. Iranian Air Force. Demonstrations by a German Junkers bomber were given last week. A separate report has been submitted. 14. Military Publications. Issue No. 10 (Volume I) of the Piyada Nizam (Infantry Journal) contains nothing of interest to the General Staff. G. D. PYBUS, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 23 for the period ending the 20 th November, compiled by the military attache to this Legation. Tehran, November 20 , 1937. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 23 for the Period ending November 20, 1937. 1. The Shah. Hls Im P er . ial Majesty the Shah, continuing his tour of Mazanderan and Hilan, arrived in Pahlavi on the 15th November and returned to Tehran on the 18th November. He was accompanied by the Crown Prince. 2 . Iranian Officials. His Excellency Inayatullah Samiyi (P. in I., No. 187), Minister for Foreign Affairs, an ived in Bagdad on an official visit on the 5 th November. He returned to Tehran on the 11 th November. 3. A fghan Interests. His Excellency Sardar Ahmad Ali Khan, the new Afghan Ambassador to Iran, arrived in Tehran on the 17th November. 4. Russian Interests. The Soviet consulate at Kermanshah has remained closed since March of this year. There is no news of its reopening. 5. Tribal. (i) Kuhgilu and- Bamai .—Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 (current), paragraph 7, and Intelligence Summary No. 20 (current), paragraph 10 (ii). A consular report from Shiraz states that no further casualties have been evacuated to Shiraz. Ihe previous and almost astronomical estimate of the casualties is now revised and stands at 600. Civil transport is no longer being requisitioned Both Ardekan and Behbehan are reported to be quiet. (ii) Baluchis. According to an official source there is likelihood of unrest in that region, where the leaders of such normally differing tribes as Gamshadzai, Yarmohamedzais and Reki are concocting, plans to create trouble. 6 . The Imperial Bank of Iran. the manager of the Meshed branch recently received a circular signed by the Uovernor-General of Khorasan to the effect that by orders of His Imperial Majesty the Shah no “ institution” might in future engage any Iranian (other than those of the menial class) without first obtaining sanction for his engagement from the local head of police. It is thought that this circular may have been intended for Iranian firms only and have been sent to the bank in error as the head office m Tehran has not, as yet, received any such circular [189 f— 1 ]■ r&gt; 2 . ' V ' J&gt; ’ : ; ^ ^j Should this assumption prove incorrect the effects of this order may be far reaching and produce an almost complete control of all superior employment by the Iranian police. An obvious deduction is that all non-Gove rnment “ institutions ” (in which, presumably, firms are included) will, in future, have to be content with either the leavings of the Iranian clerical market or else with official spies in the form of police nominees. I 7. Treaties. According to a Havas agency report from Mexico the text of a treaty of friendship between Iran and Mexico was published in Mexico on the 4th November. 8 . Civil Aviation. (i) According to an Iranian press report a sum of 40,000 rials (£500) has been allotted for the repair of the aerodrome at Bushire. (ii) Work is to begin shortly on the levelling and draining of the civil aerodrome at Kermanshah at a cost of 840,000 rials (about £10,500). It is possible that the proposal for the German Far East Air Service has been the cause of this, as for the renovation of the W/T station referred to in paragraph 9. 9. Wireless Telegraphy. (i) According to an Iranian press report the station at Bushire started to function with effect from the 27th October. (ii) An unconfirmed report states that the military W/T station at Kermanshah, for some years now out of use, has recently been put in working order and is now equipped with long and short wave sending and receiving sets enabling it also to communicate with aircraft. 10. Iranian Navy. Provided that the details as to salary and other conditions of service are satisfactorily settled, His Majesty’s Government is prepared to agree to the Iranian Government’s. request for the loan of the services of a meteorological expert to advise them on sudh. matters and to instruct Iranian naval officers in meteorological duties and marine surveykig.^. 11. Iranian Air Force. A Meshed source reports that two Iranian air force officers deserted recently by taking a service machine and flying in it over the Russian frontier. 12. The French Military Mission. General de Division Gendre, the head of the French Military Mission (who has been accorded the local rank of Sipahbad (Corps Commander) in the Iranian army), accompanied by some members of the mission, arrived in Kerman on the 10th October. After visiting Bam the party proceeded to Bandar Abbas and, embarking on the Iranian naval sloop Babr, visited Lingah and some of the islands. The party returned to Bandar Abbas on the 17th October and left for I Khorramshahr via Kerman, Sirjan and Shiraz. It is said that General Gendre showed much interest in Henjan and declared it to be the most suitable place in the Persian Gulf for an Iranian naval base. G. D.

German Interests. About a dozen members of the German Youth League under the leadership of Herr Baldour von Schirach arrived in Tehran for a short tour on the 3rd December. Considerable publicity is being given to their visit. 3. Civil Administration. A law relating to the reorganisation of the Ministry of the Interior and the division of Iran on a new administrative basis was passed by the Majlis on the 7th November. The previous division into twenty-eight Governor-General’s and Governor’s provinces has been done away with, and Iran is now divided into six Astan, or large territories. The Astan is divided into Shahristan, the Shahristan into Baksh and the Baksh into Dehistan. The Dehistan comprises Qasabas (townships) and Deh (villages). The officials appointed to administer these divisions are to be known respectively as Astandar, Farmandar, Farmanguzar, Balukdar and Kedkhuda. The list of the Astan and the Shahristan subordinate to them is as follows :— The North-Western Astan—■ (a) Khoi, Rezaieh, Mehabad, Tabriz, Ardebil, Maragheh. The Western Astan— (5) Kurdistan. Gams, Kermanshah. Bawandpur, Pusht-i-Kuh, Luristan, Burujird, Malayir, Hamadan, Khorramshahr, Abadan! Khuzistan, Kuhgilu. .[189 u—2]•2 The Northern Astan—- (£) Gilan, Tunakbun, Mazanderan, Gurgan, Tehran. Qazvin, Qum and Saveh, Kashan, Isfahan.

The North-Eastern Astan— (e) Meshed, Quchan. Sabzevar, Turbat-i-Haidari, Qainat, Firdaus, Bujnurd, Shahrud. The Sixth Astan— (/) Makran. 4. Communications. (a) Railways. —'The Majlis has voted a sum of £79,046 from reserves for the purchase of ten locomotives. (b) Roads. —(i) A new road from Zahidan to Khwash via Iskalabad has been opened, but traffic still prefers the old route via Mirjawa. (ii) Proposals are under consideration for the realignment of the Chahbar road south of Iranshahr. The present road lies largely in river beds and is impassable after rain. (iii) Work has begun on the construction of twenty new bridges on the section of road between Darajaz and Lutfabad. (iv) An engineer from Tehran has arrived in Khuzistan to study the possibility of constructing a road from Ahwaz to Khorramshahr. It is not yet known whether a decision to construct the road has been taken or which bank of the Karun River it will follow. 5. Civil Aviation. An air mail postal service between Tehran and Kermanshah started on the 30th November. The service is weekly and the machine leaves Tehran every Tuesday and returns the same day. An enquiry from the post office has elicited the information that the service will be extended to Bagdad after one month. 6 . Earthquakes. Shocks described as violent but not resulting in damage are reported from Kangavar, Sanghar and Sahneh on the 19th November. 7. Grain Shortage. A shortage of wheat exists more or less throughout Iran owing to the heavy exportations which the Government has made in order to fulfil its barter agreement obligations. In Zahidan the situation has been eased by the arrival of eight lorry loads which are the first instalment of an order of 5,000 bags from India. The arrival of large stocks from Hamadan has eased a situation bordering on famine which existed in Yezd and Kerman. 8 . Industries. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current), paragraph 5 (ii), the Majlis has voted a sum of £60,000 from reserves for the construction of this iron foundry. 9. Tribal. (i) Baluchistan. —According to an official Meshed source the Iranian Government is preparing to attack Juma Khan Ismailzai. Should this be the case, operations are likely to be extensive and of long duration as Juma Khan will probably receive support from sympathisers in Afghanistan and also from the Bamari Sardar. The 10 th Artillery Regiment at Zahidan is reported to be moving to Khwash and the 18th Camelry Regiment to Iranshahr as a precautionary measure.3 ri (n) A jabs. According to an official source from Khuzistan unrest is pievaient among the Arab tribes and many tribesmen have escaped into Iraq owing to persecution from the gendarmerie and military. Bukhtiam.—At is reported that the Government has begun to exchange the JBakhtiari chiefs properties in Bakhtiari regions with Government properties m the vicinity of Tehran. It is stated that Murteza Quli Khan (P. in I., No. 46) has been offered estates at Varamin (25 miles south-east of Tehran). (iv) Khamseh. Trouble in this area has ceased, and the troops sent to Lar have returned to Shiraz. (v) Kuhgilu and Bamai.—Ahowt 3,000 men from the 7th Ears Division are still out on active service, though from Shiraz there is no news of recent fighting. From Ahwaz it is reported that the rebels are besieged by the military on the Kuh-i-Mungasht in inaccessible country some 40 miles east of Haft Khel oil-field. Operations are stationary, and it is believed that the plan is to wait till the winter cold and a shortage of supplies force the rebels to surrender (a separate report has been submitted). 10 . Iranian Navy. The Majlis has voted an advance from reserves of £79,829 for the construction of a slipway at Pahlavi. 11 . Iranian Air Force. An unconfirmed report states that twenty officers and men of the Iranian air force have been selected to proceed at once to Germany to undergo instruction in aircraft maintenance. The same source reports a rumour to the effect that twelve Junkers Bombers (Type 86 .K.) have been ordered by the Iranian Government. 12. The It 'anian Press. The latest article in the foreign press to engage the attention and rouse the fury of the Iranian press is an article in the French paper Vaugirard Grenelle under the signature of a M. Marcel France describing the tortures employed in modern Iran. G. D. PYBUS, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache.

Lieutenant-C olonel Rohde, the German military attache at Angora, who is also acredited to Tehran, arrived in Tehran last week on a flying visit of three or tour days. Rumour has given as the reason of his visit the conclusion of a deal m German military aircraft. (See Intelligence Summary No. 24 (current), paragraph 11 .) 7 [214 k—1]2 5. Civil Administration. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 24 (current), paragraph 3 . (i) The Ministry of the Interior has been divided into four bureaux as follows : — (a) The Central Bureau (personnel, finance, tourists, elections and archives). (b) The Inspection Bureau (technical, financial and administrative sections). (c) The Municipal Bureau (municipalities). (d) The General Administrative Bureau (tribal settlement, civil status, nationality and political affairs). (ii) In the official text of the new law, the following changes have been made in the nomenclature of officials :— For “ Farmanguzar'' read “ Bakhshdar.” For “ Balukdar ' read “ Dehdar.' 6 . Tribal. BaJimai .—Reference Intelligence Summary No. 24 (current), paragraph 9 (v). There is no change in the situation. The following rumours are reported :— (a) That the Bahmai have been joined by a few discontented Bakhtiari and Mamasani. (b) That the (Government forces number 8 , 000 , out of w T hich 3,000 are from the 6 th (Khuzistan) Division. {c) That the Bahmai occasionally leave their stronghold on the Kuh-i- Mungasht to raid and carry out night attacks.

Wireless Telegraphy. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 9 (ii), the wireless station at Kermanshah is worked by military personnel and is, at present, being used exclusively for military purposes. The transmitters are of medium (600-1,000 metres) wave-length. The reception at the oil-field at Naft Shah was tolerably good and it is thought that the station would be effective up to a radius of 100 miles. The reception at Abadan was poor, being classified as “ strength 3 .” 9. Industry. According to fairly reliable reports all is not well with the tobacco monopoly. Some of the stocks have deteriorated, packing materials are exhausted, spare parts for the machinery are urgently needed and the staff have made complaints about the delay in payment of their salaries. A later report—little more than a rumour as yet—says that Dr. Friedlieb, the director, has been placed under arrest.3 10 . Iranian Navy. (i) The floating dock at Bandar Shahpur is reported to have broken loose from its moorings for the second time. It has been reanchored. (ii) The sloops Babr and Palang have been in collision in the Karun. Palang came off lightly and is under repair locally.

Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 11 , the missing machine has been found undamaged just inside Soviet territory. The Soviet authorities have notified the Iranian Government and intimated that, while they are prepared to admit an Iranian air force officer to enter Russia and fly the machine back to Tran, they will not hand over the two officers who deserted.

(c) Railways, -(i) An employee of the German firm of Sofitec, which built the lehran railway station (for which payment is still due) and which is now working on the Bandar Shahpur harbour and the Pahlavi slipway, supplied the following- notes on the alignment of the proposed Tehran-Tabriz Railway. From Tehran via Kazvin to Zinjan is a level and easy stretch. Thence the line will branch southwards to avoid the high mountains and work up towards Mehabad (Sujbulak), and thence to Tabriz via Maragheh. From Tabriz the Julfa line will be used, either up to Sufian and along the branch line to Sharafkhaneh at the north end of Lake Urumiye, or else as far as Maraud, and thence due west to Qotur on the Turco-Iranian frontier.

There is nothing further to report. [214 aa—1]5. A miranian Oil Company. The survey of this company in the Tabas area is rumoured to have been disappointing. Of the results of their survey in the Gorgan area little is known. The general impression gathered is that the company’s chief interest is in Afghanistan rather than in Iran. 6 . Travellers — Officers. Lieutenant H. M. Siddiq Choudri of the Royal Indian navy has arrived in Tehran en route to India, on expiry of leave in the United Kingdom. 7. Iranian A rmy. According to a consular report from East Iran, Sartip Tajbaksh, the Governor-General of Mekran, has been summoned to Tehran. According to him he is likely to be offered a high military appointment. (The post of Minister of War is still vacant.) According to other local rumours, he has been summoned to confer with the Iranian Government regarding the proposed military action against the Ismailzais. 8 . The Press. 1 he only so-called insult to Iran in the foreign press to cause comment in the Iranian papers of the past fortnight has been an article in the Izvestiya of the 11 th December, in which unfavourable notice was taken of the warm reception given to Von Schirach and the members of the German Youth League. This was denounced by the Izvestiya as a piece of Nazi propaganda, and as hotly defended by the Iranian press as a natural act of hospitality. 9. Iranian Officials.

According to a decree of the Council of Ministers, the cultivation of all forms of tobacco in the Isfahan district is forbidden. 7. Communications. (A) Railways— section Tehran-Qum has been handed over for exploita tion by Kampsax to the Iranian Government. Motor railcars are now running- on this section. &amp; (B) Frontier Posts. —In 1936 it was reported that a bridge over the Aras River at Arablar (degree sheet 1 E, square 3 A) was being constructed by joint boviet and Iranian enterprise. More recently it has been announced that the Iranian Government intend to develop this post by the construction of a governor s residence, a customs house and frontier post and by improving the 35 miles of road connecting Arablar with Maku. (C) Roads. —Plans are being made to construct a new road between Deh Luran in Pusht-i-Kuh (degree sheet 2 P, square 2 B) and Dizful. 8 . Security. serious hold-up involving ten tank lorries and trucks took place recently at tliG Bid i-burkh I ciss, 4() miles ecist of Iverm^nshsh. The drivers cind pcisseii o, ers are reported to have been robbed of everything they possessed and the brigands’ haul is estimated at 20,000 rials (£250). The' robbers escaped before the gendarmerie discovered what had happened. 9. Tribal. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 24 of 1937, paragraph 9 (vi). There are no major developments to report, but from a consular source come some very interesting comments on the campaign. These may be summarised as follows (i) 1 he medical and supply services have failed badly. The troops in the Mungasht area have been badly fed and clothed and dysentery has inflicted more casualties than the enemy has. (ii) The Shah is impatient at the delay in concluding the operations and also at their cost, which is said to be 100,000 rials (£1,250) per month.3 (iii) The decision to withdraw the bulk of the Ahwaz brigade and to leave a force of 600 men to contain the enemy in the Mungasht area has been cancelled. (iv) Ibe Bahmai leader has organised a mobile striking force of 400 riflemen. This force is said to have received reinforcements of fifty men each from the Mombay and Chaharlang Bakhtiari. It is intended to use this force to carry out replenishing raids on caravans and vulnerable villages. One such raid was recently made on a sugar and tea caravan near Mamatain, which is situated about 20 miles south-east of Haft Khel oil-field. 10. Civil Aviation. (i) The Bagdad paper Al Alam-ul-Arabi, in announcing the inauguration of the Tehran-Kermanshah air mail service, stated (correctly) that the machines were British and (incorrectly) that they were flown by “ experienced British pilots.” A dementi appeared in the Iranian press stating that both machines and pilots were “ exclusively Iranian.” (ii) The Kermanshah Aerodrome. —A Kermanshah consular report states that work on the local military aerodrome has been actively carried on and considerable quantities of stone for the landing ground’s foundations have been laid during the past two months. A steam-roller (lent by the Kermanshah Petroleum Company) has done invaluable service in the laying of the above- mentioned foundations and more than half of the area to be metalled has been dealt with. Ihe aerodrome, used hitherto only rarely by occasional machines, has during the past month been the scene of an unwonted activity owing to the arrival and departure, on Tuesday, every week, of the aeroplane conveying air mails between Tehran and Kermanshah and vice versa. Although the airmail is very little patronised by the public as yet, it seems pretty certain that the new service will continue to function and rumours of the forthcoming extension of the air-mail service to Bagdad are very common here, though no official confirmation on this point has been received. 11 . Iranian Army. (i) Conscription.- —A decree has been published summoning in the next Iranian year (1317) for their 1 st Reserve training those born in 1284 and called up for military training in 1304. Owing to the difficulty experienced in training conscripts with the limited number of instructors available, the Ministry of War has, since the inception of compulsory military service in 1304, concentrated on this and has not felt itself equal to coping with reservist training in addition. The liability for military service of an Iranian subject is twenty-five years commencing in his twenty-first year. This period is divided as follows : — (a) Two years with the colours. {b) Four years with the 1st Reserve (“ Ihtiyat ”) in the last of which he under goes one month’s training. (c) Thirteen years with the 2 nd Reserve (“ Zakhireh-i-Muqaddam ”) during which he undergoes one month every two years. (d) Six years with the 3rd Reserve (“ Zakhireh-i-Tali ”) during which he undergoes one month every three years. As the reservist training for which reservists are now being called up is their first (in this particular case the training which should have been carried out in 1310) it will be realised what a lot of leeway the Ministry of War has to make up, and it may well happen that no effort will be made to carry out the 2 nd and 3rd Reserve periods of training for many years to come. (ii) Following on the regrouping of' the civil divisions of the country, a rumour is reported from Kermanshah to the effect that that town is to become the headquarters of the 5th &lt;c Astan.” A natural corollary is the rumour that the Kermanshah brigade is to be increased to a division. TMs is not very probable as Kermanshah lies too far south to dominate Kurdish tribal areas (as ^enneh does) and too far north to command Luristan (as Burujird does). x12. Iranian Air Force. ' v r ' , • ' ? (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 of 1937, paragraph 11 . The Iranian Air Force pilot who went across the Soviet border to fly the machine back to Iran has ret]ttUXod empty.Thanded. The Soviet authorities have refused him permission to fly the%iacMi|p. Kfe can, they say, dismantle it, pack it and cart it away, but they will hot permit Jt to be flown across the border. (ii) One of tl|^ $few * £ $Tiger Moths, which had been constructed and assembled at Bosham TeppeK aerodrome, was crashed when undergoing its first test. V „ 13. The Press. * ■„ ••■ (i) The Iranian press has been officially roused to fury over some passages deemed insulting to Iran and to His Imperial Majesty the Shah which, according to a London correspondent, appeared recently in an English paper. The press awaits the arrival of the&gt;offending articles before returning to the attack. (ii) The Soviet Government has also been pilloried on account of holding up in Baku rails required for the Transiranian Railway. Tehran, January 15, 1938. G. D.

The Soviet authorities transported it as far as the frontier and the Iranian air force flew it thence to Meshed. 10. The Press.

(ii) An article in the Swiss paper Neue Biindner Zeitung reporting a lecture by a Swiss engineer who had been employed on railway construction in Iran The Iran, in an article entitled “ An Engineer Turns out to be a Spy,” complains bitterly of the lecturer’s remarks on Iranian history.

A meeting was recently interrupted and two military officers attending it were sent to Tehran and, it is said, dismissed from the service. The reason given is interesting. It is rumoured that the Bahais of Iran had been in the habit of disclosing details about military affairs to the head of their community in Cyprus. It was transmitted thence to the Soviet authorities in the hopes that these gratuitous efforts in espionage might procure, in return, better treatment for Bahais in Russia. [239 ee—2]7.

The judicial investigation has decided not to take action against those found guilty of taking bribes, not on account of any doubt of their guilt, but on account of the magnitude of the task and the large amount of money involved.

Sardar Nazar Jan Narui, a Sistan Sardar. who was attempting to organise his kinsmen’s resistance to Ismailzai aggression, has apparently now abandoned his efforts and withdrawn. In the Ismaflzai camp, preparations to resist military operations seem to be afoot; Juma Khan is believed to have transferred most of his valuables to Afghanistan, and has moved farther into the hills with his fighting men. where he has been joined, it is understood, by Mulla Rahim Ismailzai. an Afghan Sarhaddar, with a few followers and two camel-loads of arms and ammunition. The Iranian authorities meanwhile seem anxious to cultivate good relations with other Baluchi Sardars. Mir Ahmed Khan, brother of Mir Hussain Khan of Geh. has been given a suit of clothes, some toilet requisites and a cash present, while presents have also been distributed to other Sardars. Ahmed Khan is said to have been particularly warned by Colonel Mukri to have nothing to do with the British Government, whose policy it is to create strife among the Baluchis. Mir Safaraz Khan and Mohamed A slam, whose tribal territories lie on the route to Chahbar, are said to have agreed to facilitate the passage of troops through their territory, provided they are permitted to protect the route themselves; they already receive subsidies from the authorities. 5.

[289 1—2]2 The levelling of the track-was, begun on the 15th March. The length of this branch line is said to be 1 ifel&amp;ilom. As this track will keep south of the mountainous country near Firuzkuh; .no engineering difficulties should be encountered. ; Semnan has i-ecently cdnie into prominence as a possible oil and iron mining centre. . No rumour of this project had been heard, and it is interesting that ^ construction of this line should have received preference over the larger project of the Tehran-Turkey line, of which so much has been heard in the last year. (bj Telegraphs .—The Government has decided to construct a telephone line between Ahwaz and Isfahan through the Bakhtiari country. At the moment it has not been decided whether the line will follow the Lynch Road or the new proposed road from Ahwaz to Isfahan (see Intelligence Summary No. 17 of 1935, paragraph 7). 7.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 8 for the period ending the 9th April compiled by the military attache to this Legation. Tehran, April 9, 1938. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 8 for the Period ending March 9. 1938^ 1. Iranian Diplomatic A ppointments. HIS Excellency Said Muhammad (Said-ul-Vizareh) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 185; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 171), Iranian Minister at Rome since June 1936, has been appointed Ambassador at Moscow in place of Sipahbudi, Anushirwan (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 206; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 179), who has been recalled to Tehran. 2. Communications. Railways .—The section Qum (million sheet No. 9, square C 2). and Rahgird (million sheet No. 9, square C 2). has been completed and is now open for traffic. Rahgird is 67 kilom. south-west of Qum and 73 kilom. from Iraq (Sultanabad). 3. The Majlis. The 43rd session of the Majlis was opened on the 3rd April. Hassan Isfandiyari (Muhtashim-us-Sultaneh) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 85; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 73). was re-elected President of the Majlis by 98 votes out of 106. Murteza Quli Bayat (Samsam-ul-Mulk) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 47; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 51), and Dr. Taheri were re-elected vice- presidents. 4. Conscription. On the 4th April a new and detailed Bill to amend the existing Conscription Law was introduced into the Majlis for the first time by the Minister of War. The Bill contains nineteen chapters and 116 articles with numerous notes and exceptions. It still appears very complicated. The total period of service is now divided up as follows :— (i) Two years with the colours (zir-i-parcham). (ii) Four years with the reserve (ihtiyat). (iii) Fourteen years with the 1st (supplementary) reserve (Zakhireh-i-ekam). (iv) Five years with the 2nd (supplementary) reserve (Zakhireh-i-duvum). Naval recruits on first joining have to serve with the colours for two years and four months. The Bill lays down in detail regulations for the constitution of local recruiting committees, methods of procedure, &amp;c. It also specifies the periods for which students and professional men may be exempted from training. Details are also given for the promotion of officers whilst serving with the reserve. [289 cc—1]5. Tribal. Baluchistan .—Reference Intelligence Summary No. 6 (current), para graph 4 (ii). According to a consular report still no move has been made against the Ismailzais who continue their raids on Narui flocks. Juma Khan Ismailzai is said to he busy collecting ammunition. About the middle of February a^ Major Taimuriyan was sent on special duty to interview Juma Khan Ismailzai and give him a final warning. 6. The Iranian Army. Sarhang (Colonel) Dr. Karim Hidayat (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 75), has been promoted sartip (brigadier) at Shiraz in the 7th (Pars) Division. 7. Italian Interests. The Italian warship Eritrea arrived at Khorramshahr on the 2nd March and left for Basra on the 7th. The Italian Minister and some members of the Italian mission made a special journey to Khorramshahr from Tehran to greet their fellow countrymen. 8. The A miranian Oil Company. The company originally intended to commence drilling operations in the Gurgan District south-east of the Caspian Sea, but recent discoveries north and south of Zahidan have led to a change in plans. The company are, however, meeting with unexpected difficulties with regard to the purchase of land. Most of the land in East Iran (nearly the whole of Seistan) is Crown land, and it is reported that extortionate prices are being demanded. Some of the land is also claimed as the personal property of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. Mr. F. G. Clapp, the director of the Amiranian Oil Company, recently visited Tehran in this connexion. From a consular source it is reported that pending a settlement of this difficulty the heavy drilling machinery, &amp;c. (some 4,000 tons), which recently arrived at Bandar Shahpur, is being diverted to Basra and thence possibly to Afghanistan. It is considered more likely that the question of transporting this machinery to the drilling areas is the main difficulty, as there are only three possible routes to the areas in question :— (i) Via Bandar Shahpur by rail and road. A very circuitous and difficult route. (ii) Via Charbar (a route favoured by the Iranian Government). This,- however, is practically impossible as no unloading facilities exist at Charbar and the road north is only a rough track. (iii) Via Karachi and Nok Kundi (a route favoured by the company). Transport would, however, be difficult between Nok Kundi and Mirjawa, but it might be possible to improve the road or persuade the North-Western Railway of India to put the line into commission again as far as the frontier on payment of an agreed sum and the promise of regular business. 9. Iranian Baluchistan. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 6 (current), paragraph 7. Sartip Mahmud Amin (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 14), the new General Officer Commanding the 9th (Mekran) Division at Khwash, is reported to be an efficient and energetic officer. He is a strict Mahometan, and as such has made a great impression. Khwash itself is an insignificant place with a civil population of only 700. The garrison in the new barracks some 6 miles west of the town number about 1,300. It is proposed to build the new artillery lines much nearer the town. 10. The French Military Mission. During March General de Division Gendre, head of the French Military Mission, accompanied by several senior Iranian military staff officers from Tehran, visited and inspected military posts in the Pusht-i-Kuh area and subsequently frontier posts in Kurdistan.3 11. Espionage. According to a press report a special military court recently tried two Iranian civilians for alleged espionage at the offices of the Boole militaire in Tehran. It is said that the accused were in the pay of a foreign Power. One of the accused ^jvas sentenced to death, the other to five years’ imprisonment. 12. Civil Administration. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 3 and Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), paragraph 3. “ Ustan No. 3 and “ Ustan ” No. 4 should be amended to read as follows :— “ Ustan ” No. 3, comprises the following “ Shahristan ” : Tabriz, Ardebil. “ Ustan ” No. 4, comprises the following “ Shahristan ” : Khoi, Rezaieh, Mahabad, Maragheh, Bijar. 13. Civil A viation. The passenger service, operated by the Deutsche Luft Hansa Line between Berlin-Tehran-Kabul, has definitely commenced. The first aeroplane of the Junkers type left Tehran on the homeward journey on the 5th April with four Iranians as passengers. The cost of the journey to Berlin, which takes two days, is said to he 5,200 rials (£65 at the present rate of exchange) per passenger. H. J. UNDERWOOD. Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

His Excellency Hussain Ala, C.M.G. (Muin-ul-Vizareh) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 9; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 11), has been relieved of his duties as president of the Committee of Government Monopoly Companies and Minister of Commerce. It is said that he was handed a slip of paper from the Shah, which merely stated that he was no longer a Minister. He was raised to the rank of Cabinet Minister in October 1937. Vassighi, Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Commerce, has been appointed acting Minister. 2. The Iranian Army. (i) From reliable sources, it is reported that the artillery tractors purchased in Germany for the Iranian army have proved unsatisfactory. Their consumption of petrol is excessive, viz., 200 litres per 100 kilom. The transmission shafts are not covered, and frequently jam as a result of becoming coated with dust. The body length is also too long and difficulty is experienced in negotiating corners and hairpin bends. (ii) It is reported from a reliable source that the Telefunken Company of Germany are to supply 160 portable field wireless sets to the Iranian army. It is said that these will be distributed at ten sets per division. (iii) The military garrison at Bundar Abbas has been reduced from one regiment to three companies of infantry. The garrison will now come under the Kerman Independent Composite Brigade. (iv) Sarhang (Colonel) Ali Akbar Siahpush (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 253), Commanding the Kerman Independent Composite Brigade, has been promoted Sartip (brigadier). He formerly commanded the 5th (Senneh) Brigade, and was in charge of the Bashagird operations. 3. Conscription. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 8 (current), paragraph 4. During the discussion on the new Conscription Bill now before the Majlis, Ettesam Zadeh, a Deputy for Tehran, proposed that the Ministry of War formulate plans for the conscription of Iranian women during war time for service with hospitals, offices, &amp;c. This proposal, which caused a mild sensation in the capital, has been referred to the War Committee.2 4. Espionage. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 8 (current), paragraph 11. During the period under review the Iranian press devoted several heated columns o o recent espionage trial and spies and traitors in general. , , Each individual officer of the Tehran Garrison has received a printed order from the Ministry of War calling attention to this espionage trial, and forbidding them to discuss military subjects anywhere. 5. The Amiranian Oil Company. Mr. F. G. Clapp, vice-director of the Amiranian Oil Company, accompanied by geologists, again visited areas in the vicinity of Gomosh Tapeh (Gumish Tapeh) and Naphte Lidjeh^ 1 ) approximately 3 kilom. from Gomosh Tapeh (million sheet 15, square 3 C). Both these places are situated north of Bundar Shah (million sheet 15, square 4 B). 6. Communications. Railways .—Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 7. A service of motor rail cars is now running three times weekly (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays) between Tehran-Qum-Tehran. The distance by rail is 180 kilom. and the journey takes approximately three-and-a-half hours. Roads .—According to a press report, work has commenced on a new road from Bundar Pahlevi to Astara (million sheet 9, square A 2) on the U.S.S.R. frontier. It is reported that the Directorate-General of the Turkish State Railways has organised a regular motor coach and lorry service between Bazagird (Iran- Turkish frontier) and Trebizond. Passengers, luggage, goods and merchandise are carried at fixed rates. 7. Baluchistan Frontier: Iranian Survey. It is understood that an Iranian survey party intend surveying the Iranian border at Gorani, 80 miles south-east of Mirjawa, moving north-west. The com mission will be headed by General Abdul Rezzak, who was a member of the East Boundary Commission. The survey operations will continue to some date in May. 8. Refugees. According to press reports a large number of refugees have recently arrived in Bundar Pahlevi, and are being cared for by the local authorities. On the 7th April as many as 1,250 persons landed. The press are careful not to mention who these refugees are and from whence they came. It is, however, known that they are Iranian subjects who recently resided in Russia. This action is probably being taken in retaliation for the expulsion of Russians from Iran during recent months. 9. Italian Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 8 (current), paragraph 7. It is learnt from a consular source that the Italian naval visit did not create a favourable impression either amongst the Iranian officials at Khurramshahr or the townspeople. 10. Changes in Place Nomenclature. The name of the Tehran suburb of Shah Abdul Azim (million sheet 9, square D 1) has been officially changed to Shahr Rei. This suburb is built close to the original site of the ancient city of Rei (Raghas) and contains the well known shrine of Shah Abdul Azim. The name of Ashraf (million sheet 15, square B 4) has been altered to Behshahr. 11. The Crown Prince. His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince continues his studies at the officers’ school in Tehran. ( x ) Presumably meant for Khwaja Nafas.3 * Recently he visited the new National Bank building. The banking system was explained to him by Sartip Khosrovi, president of the National Bank, and afterwards, accompanied by members of the Cabinet and the General Staff, he toured the building. ^ Civil Aviation. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 8 (current), paragraph 13. The Deutsche Lufthansa Berlin-Tehran-Berlin passenger service is now operating to the following summer schedule :— Hours.

A reduction of 20 per cent, is made on return tickets. The machines fly regularly on to Kabul, but the carrying of passengers to and from the Afghan capital has not yet been officially authorised. This is expected at a very early date. The extension of this air line to the Far East is foreshadowed as soon as conditions there become normal. The journey from Tehran-Berlm normally takes twenty-seven hours, the service would, therefore, appear to be one of the world’s fastest. It is understood that Deutsche Lufthansa intend employing machines with accommodation for forty passengers, and with a cruising speed of 200 m.p.h., later in the year. No mails or passengers may, at present, be conveyed by this air line between Tehran and Bagdad, as this would compete with the Iranian State Air Line now operating between Tehran-Kermanshah-Bagdad. It is understood that numbers of Europeans and Iranian passengers have already booked passages to Berlin by this line. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

Tehran, May 21, 1938. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 11 for the Period ending May 21, 1938. (Secret.) 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, has been carrying out an extensive and detailed inspection of all military establish ments, factories and new public works in the provinces of Mazanderan and Gilan. The Iranian press state that His Majesty and the Crown Prince have everywhere met with a most popular and enthusiastic reception. 2. Travellers. The undermentioned officer arrived in Tehran during the period under review. He is in transit from India to Europe : — Major W. A. Fausset, 7th Light Battery, Royal Artillery, and wife. 3. Iranian Tobacco Monopoly. The following British mechanics left Tehran for England during the period under review on the expiration of their contracts with the Iranian Tobacco Monopoly. They are travelling via Bagdad and Damascus : — Mr. W. E. Kench. Mr. J. H. Rutherford and wife. 4. Iranian Officials. (i) His Excellency Ali Soheli (Military Attache's Personalities, No. 207; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 194), Iranian Minister in London since March 1937, has been recalled. The reason for his recall is not known. (ii) M. Abdul Hussein Massoud Ansari (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 21 (i) ; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 25), Chief of the Protocol Depart ment in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs since December 1937, has been appointed Iranian consul-general in India. (iii) M. Abdullah Entezam (Foreign Office Personalities, No. 68) has been appointed Charge d’Affaires of the Iranian Legation in Switzerland. 5. Communications. Trans-Iranian Railway .—The line from the south working northwards has been laid as far as Do-Roud (Bahrein) (million sheet No. 9, square 3a) about 50 kilom. south of Burujird (million sheet 9, square 3a). The northern section working southwards is complete as far as Ibrahimabad (million sheet No. 9. square 2c). It is anticipated that it will reach Iraq (Sultanabad) by the end of May. [339 n—3]Branch Lines .—Reference Intelligence Summary No. 10 (current), para graph 10. Qishlaq (million sheet No. 16, square 1a), Semnan (million sheet No. 16, square 1b). Ten kilom. of this line has been completed. Roads.—On the 17th May His Imperial Majesty the Shah formally declared open the Kandawan tunnel (degree sheet 8p, square 4b) on the lehran-Kerej- ^ Chains road. ^ ^ A brief description of this route, called by the Iranians Ihe Special Road, may be of interest. The road was completed in 1933 at a cost of over £1 million to gratify the whim of the Shah. His Imperial Majesty desired a road offering facilities for a more rapid transit from the capital to his estates in Mazanderan than was afforded by either the Kazvin—Rosht or the Firuzkuh-Shahi route. He also,wanted a direct route from those estates to the Iranian plateau to facilitate the export of his agricultural produce. The extraordinarily heavy rainfall^ on the Caspian side of the watershed, the heavy snowfall on the Kandawan Pass (9,625 feet) and down to 6,000 feet on either side, and the liability to landslide of the gypsum hillsides near Gach-i-Sar (million sheet No. 8, square 4d) on the southern side have all combined to close this road effectively from the end ot October to the middle of May each year since its completion. What sums are expended on snow clearing, removal of landslides, repaving of fords, and the upkeep of the 200 bridges over the main and the side streams have never been disclosed. The Kandawan tunnel is 2,800 metres in length beneath the Kandawan I ass and at an altitude of 6,000 feet. Even this gigantic work will not keep the road open all the year round as, firstly, the entrance and exit of the tunnel are well above the winter snow line, and, secondly, the portions which suffer most from landslides after rain lie on both sides, considerably below the altitude of the tunnel. ... . j i -w* i The route is an example of Royal caprice, in its bold conception and skuiul construction, a source of legitimate wonder to the adventurous tourist. It is of no commercial or strategical value. A press report states that the height of the tunnel above sea level is 3,030 metres: it pierces the mountain at a height of 2,700 metres. Ninety thousand cubic metres of earth and stone have been excavated, and 46,400 kilog. of explosives was used for blasting. It has taken three years to complete. 6. Harbours. The Julius Berger Company of Germany have been awarded the contract for extending the present jetty at Bandar Shahpur (million sheet No. 10, square 2a) from 140 metres long and 3^ metres wide to 292 metres long and 6i metres wide.

Reference Inteligence Summaries Nos. 9 and 10 (current), paragraph 8. Refugees continue to arrive from the U.S.S.R. During the period under review 3,000 n entered the Province of Azerbaijan via Julfa. Most of these were small merchants from the Caucasus area. The total number of refugees up to date is in the neighbourhood of 5,000. It is possible, however, that the total number to be expelled may reach 9,000 to 10,000. Many of those expelled, although Iranian subjects, are, in fact, Russian born. On reliable authority it is said that these expulsions are not solely confined to Iranian subjects. No official reason has been given for these expulsions, and even in Iran the matter is being kept very quiet.3 9. Tribal. The troops of the Kerman Independent Composite Brigade who took part in the recent punitive expedition against the Bashakird have now returned from Bandar Abbas area to Sirjan. Field and mountain artillery attached for duty ^with the Bashakird column returned to Kerman. 10. Civil A viation. Landing Grounds. —Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), para graph 10 (ii). Work on the Kermanshah military landing ground has been completed and it is now fit for use all the year round. There are no ground staff or personnel and as yet no sheds or hangars have been erected for accommodating aircraft. It is not lighted at night, but it would be possible to make an emergency landing as the position of the landing ground could be located by aircraft, as it is situated approximately 2^ miles due south of the Kermanshah Petroleum Company’s refinery, which is always brilliantly lighted throughout the night A plan of the landing ground is given as Appendix ££ A ’’Q to this summary. 11. Buildings. (i) It is reported that Messrs. Balloca, an Italian firm, have secured a contract for the construction of seven grain silos, each of 16,000 tons capacity. (ii) A factory for the manufacture of optical glasses and instruments is being constructed in Tehran. Foreign specialists have been engaged and the machinery is already being installed. (iii) It is reported from a reliable source that the Iranian Government intend constructing a new and up-to-date general hospital south of Tehran (in the vicinity of the railway station) of 500 beds. The cost is estimated to be more than 8 million tomans (£1 million). Swiss architects are at present engaged in drawing up the plans. 12. Treaties. Subject to ratification, a treaty of friendship has been signed at Buenos Aires between the representatives of Iran and the United States of Mexico 13. British Interests. The Indo-European Telegraph Department wireless station at Lingah, which ceased functioning in 1931, has now been formally handed over to the Iranian Government. 14. The Iranian A ir Force. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 10 of 1936, paragraph 3 (iii). Colonel Bevir, Belgian adviser to the Iranian air force, left Tehran during the period under review on expiration of his contract. It is said that he will not be replaced. 15. Baluchistan Frontier — Iranian Survey. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 10 (current), paragraph 7. It is reported that the Iranian survey party, fearing attack by local tribes, have abandoned work at Gorani and have withdrawn to Zabul. 16. The Press. Several articles have appeared in the Iranian press during the period under review expressing concern for the receding of the water in the Caspian Sea and possibly preparing the public for the news of the total loss of one or two of the new and expensive harbours which have been constructed. The reasons given for the rapid recedence of water are (a) earth tremors in the bed of the sea, and (b) that many of the streams of Gilan, Mazanderan and Gurgan are now being utilised for irrigation purposes, as is also the Volga River in Russia. If the Caspian Sea continues to recede at its present rate, which is stated to be about 30 cm. per annum, the whole of the Gulf of Gurgan (Astarabad Bay) may become dried up within a period of fifteen-twenty years, thus preventing the use of the ports of Bandar-i-Gaz (degree sheet 15h, square Id) and Bandar Shah (!) Not reproduced.(degree sheet 15g, square 1a), the northern terminus of the Trans-Iranian Railway. The ports of Babul Sar (Meshed-i-Sar) (degree sheet 15d, square 2c) and Nau Shahr (degree sheet 8p, square 2c) will constantly have to be prolonged to follow the sea. Bandar Pahlavi (degree sheet 8g, 3b) is not in any immediate danger of^ becoming dried up, but steps may also have to be taken there to lengthen piers and breakwaters. It is possible that the important Caspian Sea fishing industry may become affected owing to the increase of salt deposits in the sea. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache.

The wedding will probably take place in Tehran. Following the announcement, and by order of the Ministry of the Interior, every town and city in Iran was illuminated and decorated for a period of three days. It is considered that the House of Pahlavi has undoubtedly strengthened its own position by this move. The Iranian press welcome the news with columns in praise of the Roval Family. The ” man in the street.” however, thinks it is all due to the planning of the British, and only wonders when the cost of living and taxation will be reduced. 3. Travellers.

An offer was made by the Iranian authorities to enlist a number of his tribesmen in the Amnieh (road guards), provided Juma Khan surrendered. This offer was not accepted. Malik Ali Shah Khan, the Narui Sirdar, is reported to have been sent to Zabul. Bahmai .—Reference Intelligence Summary No. 7 (current), paragraph 7.

(ii) The jute factory at Resht has been enlarged to twice its original size. 19. Civil A viation. (i) The Deutsche Lufthansa Berlin-Tehran-Kabul service continues to operate regularly. Lately, however, the machines have taken to landing at the military aerodrome in Meshed, which they had been instructed only to use in case of emergency. These frequent landings are most unpopular, as all Iranian military machines have hurriedly to be put out of sight.4 (ii) A report from Kabul states that the Afghan Government are considering the advisability of following the example of the Iranian Government in giving permission for a weekly Lufthansa service to Kabul on condition that separate applications are made for each flight. The Russian Ambassador in Kabul is said to have requested the Afghan Government to refuse permission for the extension of the German air service. His request was ignored. (iii) The Russian press contains articles on the increasing German influence „ in Iran, pointing out amongst other things that the Lufthansa Berlin-Tehran- Kabul air line is purely political and not commercial.

Tehran. June 18, 1938. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary A 7 o. 13 for the Period ending June 18. 1938. 1. The Shah.

[364 d—2]6. The A mironian Oil Company. Reference Intelligence Summary No. V2 (current), paragraph 14. It has now been officially announced in the Majlis that the Amiranian Oil Company have abandoned their concession in Iran. The exact reasons are at present unknown, but it would appear that oil has not been discovered in sufficient quantities to warrant the great expense of drilling operations and the laying of a pipe-line. &amp;c. According to a report from the British military attache at Kabul, the Inland Exploration Company (the Afghan branch of the Amiranian Oil Company) have decided to abandon further operations in Northern Afghanistan for the present and to concentrate on operations in Seistan, Kandahar and the Southern Provinces. The company’s geologists are. however, of the opinion that there is little hope of finding oil in large quantities in these areas. To justify the construction of a pipe-line to the Persian Gulf, the cost of which might be £10 million, the production of oil must amount to 4 to 5 million barrels per annum. The company have never intended installing refineries in Afghanistan, but proposed selling ithe crude oil in the best market, which might be Russia, Persian Gulf or India. 7. The Iranian Army.

The weekly Iranian air mail service from Tehr'an-Kermanshah- Bagdad now leaves the capital on Thursday mornings, returning on Fridays. 9. Aerodromes.

(iii) This year also work has commenced on the construction of the silos at Kermanshah and Shiraz, and the foundations of the silos at Meshed and Ahwaz have been excavated.

An article about the Royal engagement and Iran, which appeared in the News Review of the 2nd June, has brought a long and furious reply from the official Tran. During the course of its tirade the newspaper makes the interesting statement that this is not the first time in Persian history that a Shiah of Royal blood has married a Sunni. Apparently a daughter of Shah Abbas Safavi married the Governor of Ardelan (now Kurdistan), who was a Sunni. 3. British Interests. Major J. B. Cunningham, Royal Indian Army Service Corps, language student, has arrived in Isfahan. 4. Iraqi Interests. His Excellency Khalil Suleyman, Minister for Iraq, has left Tehran on completion of three years’ appointment. 5. French Interests.

They also visited Zabul and the Helman River at Band-i-Kuhak (Degree Sheet 30.F—Square D.l) before returning to Tehran. (ii) As only five members of the French military mission remain, it has been decided to appoint instructors for the Fcole de Guerre from the Iranian army itself.

(vii) The Ministry of War has set up a special military commission under the presidency of Sartip (Brigadier) Knazari to inspect all magazines and armouries, to fix the quantities of artillery and small arms ammunition required for annual training, also to fix the quantities required as a reserve for war. (vii) The Conscription Bureau have called up for one month’s training with the colours all men born in a.h. 1284 (a.d. 1906) from the following areas : Tehran, Qazvin, Qum, Semnan, Firouzkuh and Sabzewar. The numbers affected are estimated at 4,000. 8. Boy Scouting (Pishahingi). According to the official press, the number of boy scouts in Iran are increas ing. The latest figures are as follows : — Total number of troops Total number of boy scouts ... Total number of scout officers 698 18,564 4,402 9. The Iranian Navy. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 of 1937, paragraph 10. The Iranian Government have dropped their request for the loan of a British naval officer as an instructor in marine surveying, &amp;c. It is reported that the salary asked for by His Majesty’s Government was too high. 10. Civil Aviation. (i) Deutsche Lufthansa aeroplanes no longer land at Meshed aerodrome; the company had apparently satisfactorily concluded negotiations with the Govern ment for carrying passengers from Tehran to Meshed and vice versa, but the Shah refused to give his final approval to the scheme, as a result, it is said, of Russian pressure. (ii) A report from Kabul confirms that Deutsche Lufthansa must obtain permission from the Afghan Government every time they fly machines to Kabul.3 11. Ivano-Baluchistan Frontier. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 12 (current), paragraph 20. The Iranian Amnieh (Road Guards) have now been released and escorted back to the frontier. The troops of the Mekran Levy Corps have withdrawn from the area in ^ dispute except for observation posts. The chief cause of the trouble is the impetuosity of the new officer in charge of the Iranian Amnieh known as the Naib Durrani. The matter is still under discussion between the Governments of Iran and India. 12. Russian-Iranian Frontier. Unusual Russian military activity is reported in the Sarakhs area (Million Sheet No. 28—Square B.4). The Khorasan Irano-Russian frontier is said to be partially closed. 13. Communications. (i) Bridges .—A bridge has been completed between Mian Pushtah (Pahlevi) and Ghazian (Degree Sheet 8.G—Square B.3). This now permits of easy com munication between Ghazian and Pahlevi on the other side of the estuary. Formerly there were only ferry-boats. (ii) Railways .—Recently several Swedish engineers arrived in Zinjan (Million Sheet No. 8—Square 4.A) to survey the route of the proposed Tehran- Tabriz-Turkish frontier railway. An order for 1^ million marking pegs has already been given. 14. Conscription. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 8 (current), paragraph 4. The new conscription law, introduced into the Majlis on the 4th April, has passed its second reading and ipso facto becomes law. 15. Medical. A Government laboratory has been constructed at Hessarak (Degree Sheet 9.1—Square D.l), about 30 miles west of Tehran, for the preparation of anti typhoid and anti-diphtheria serums. The Pasteur Institute of Tehran is also collaborating with the laboratory. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 15 for the period ending the 16th July, 1938, compiled by the military attache to this Legation. Tehran, July 16, 1938. A 1 Jfc. 6450 1938 August 8, 1938. Section 1 . (Secret.) Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 15 for the Period ending July 16, 1938. 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Royal family are still in residence at the summer palace of Saadabad. His Majesty is reported to be as indefatigable as ever, rising at 4 a.m. and retiring to rest between 8 and 9 p.m. He continues to pay unexpected visits to the various training camps, &amp;c., in the neighbourhood. 2. The Royal Engagement. The Iranian mission headed by the Prime Minister, M. Mahmud Jam, has returned from Egypt. The Prime Minister has been decorated by the Shah with the “ Order of the Taj (Crown),” 1st Class. No official announcement has yet been made concerning the marriage, but it is thought most probable that it will take place soon after Nou Ruz (21st March) next year. Considerable speculation is current as to what really happened in Egypt. It is said that the Egyptian Ministers made careful enquiries as to whether Princess Fowzieh would be recognised as the Crown Princess and eventual Queen of Iran, whether any son born to her would be recognised as the heir to the throne. (At present this is against the Constitution.) It is further said that the Prime Minister had to consult his Royal master by telegraph on these subjects, much to the surprise of the Egyptians. The “ man in the street,” who originally said that the whole business had been engineered by the British, says that the British are not now so keen that the marriage should take place. The Iranian press continues to attack the foreign press for the publication of articles on the engagement a la Daily Sketch. 3. Iranian Officials. (i) His Excellency S. Mostafa Adi (Mansur-us-Saltaneh) (Foreign Office Personalities, No. 3) has been appointed Iranian Minister at Rome to fill an existing vacancy. (ii) His Excellency M. Anushirwan Sipahbudi (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 206 ; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 179) has been appointed Iranian Minister at Paris to fill an existing vacancy. (iii) His Excellency Ali Soheily, Foreign Minister, and his Excellency Ali Ashgar Hikmat, Minister of Education, have been temporarily suspended from duty. The reason is not known. [389 h—1]4. The Iranian Army. (i) General de Division Gendre, head of the French Military Mission, has handed over that appointment to Colonel Henriet. General de Division Gendre is now acting as adviser on frontier defences until he finally leaves for France in September. From the 7th to 20th June General Gendre, together with a number of senior Iranian staff officers, visited various military frontier posts in Kurdistan. (ii) It is reported from Czechoslovak sources that over 100 anti-aircraft machine guns have been ordered. These guns are said to be of the latest pattern and used in pairs on a twin mounting. (iii) Six Iranian officers who have completed the last course at the Ecole superieure de Guerre at Tehran have been selected to proceed to Europe in September for further instruction at the staff colleges in Berlin, Paris, Brussels and Stockholm. (iv) It is reliably reported, but as yet unconfirmed, that the garrison at Rezaieh, 3rd (Western Azerbaijan) Division, has been increased by at least two complete regiments. New barracks are also being constructed just outside the town. 5. Communications. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 10 (current), paragraph 10 (i) and (li). It is reported from a reliable source that Consortium Kampsax will construct the line Tehran-Tabriz-Turkish frontier. The survey and staking of this line between Tehran and Qazvin (million sheet No. 8, square 3 B) has already been completed. The survey party are now at Siah Dahan (million sheet No. 8, square B 4), working on the second section, Qazvin-Zinjan (million sheet No. 8, square A 4). (ii) The Iranian Government themselves intend to carry out the extension of the Qishlaq (million sheet No. 16, square A 1)-Semnan (million sheet No. 16, square B 1) to Meshed. (iii) Great importance is given to the construction of a branch line from Qum (million sheet No. 9, square C 2) to Qashan (million sheet No. 16, square B 3)- Anarek (million sheet No. 16, square B 3) in order to exploit the large mining area there (vide Intelligence Summary No. 12, paragraph 17). A survey party is already at work on this route, which it is considered presents few engineering difficulties. 6. Meteorological Classes. The Ministry of Education has arranged for meteorological classes to be held for school-teachers who are to he trained as observers. The first course is to commence at Tehran shortly. 7. The Amiranian Oil Company. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 13 (current), paragraph 6. According to a report from the British military attache at Kabul, the Inland Exploration Company (the Afghan branch of the Amiranian Oil Company) have decided to abandon their concession in Afghanistan. 8. Irano-Turkish Frontier. In accordance with the Irano-Turkish Treaty, a mixed commission will meet periodically to decide all frontier questions. This mixed commission is now assembled for the first time at Trebizond in order to discuss questions concerning the construction of custom-houses and through transit for commercial motor lorries on the Trebizond-Tabriz high-road. 9. Boy Scouting. The Ministry of Education has circularised all provincial educational authorities, ordering them to redouble their efforts to increase the number of boy scouts, and to hold camps for their instruction in scouting and physical training. It has been decided to hold a “Jamboree” at Persepolis from the the 21st March to the 20th April, 1939.3 10. Refugees. Keference Intelligence Summaries Nos. 9 and 10 (current), paragraphs 8. A further batch of 250 deported Iranian subjects, mostly women and children, recently arrived in Bandar Pahlevi. Another party of fifty-six (all women and children) have arrived at Bajgiran (Khorasan) (million sheet No. 22, square C 3) in a pitiable state. They have apparently been deported without their menfolk and are most anxious about their fate. The official Iranian press have recently published articles protesting against these deportations, but couched in quiet terms. 11. The Iranian Tobacco Monopoly. British mechanics employed by the Iranian Tobacco Monopoly are experiencing difficulty in obtaining the sterling portion of their salary. In the majority of cases it has not been paid for three months. A strike is contemplated. 12. Civil Administration. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 of 1938, paragraph 3, and Intelligence Summary No. 8 of 1938, paragraph 12.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 16 for the period ending the 30th July compiled by the military attache to this Legation. Tehran, July 30, 1938. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 16 for the Period ending July 30, 1938. 1 . The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, visited the Iranian aircraft factory of Shahbaz, Doshantappeh, on the afternoon of Thursday, the 21 st July, to inspect the five De Havilland aircraft, the fuselages and airframes of which had been built at the factory. The inspection and test flying was very satisfactory, and His Imperial Majesty expressed his approval both to Sarhang (Colonel) Khrosvani, Air Officer Commanding, and Sarwan (Captain) Afghami, chief test pilot of the Iranian Air Force. The Iranian press have published a large number of photographs and special articles of the event, praising the progress made at the aircraft factory and the extraordinary forethought of His Imperial Maiesty in setting up such a factory. Great care whs taken to see that none of the British mechanics appeared in any of the photographs, and no mention was made of their presence. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), paragraph 3 (iii). His Excellency Muzaffar Alam (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 11; Foreign Office Personalities No. 2), Iranian Minister to Iraq since April 1936, has been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in succession to His Excellency Ali Soheilly, dismissed. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), paragraph 3 (iii). His Excellency Ali Ashgar (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 78; Foreign Office Personalities No. '98) is still suspended. Dr. Nasr has been appointed iVcting Minister. The suspension of Hikmat is rumoured to be in connexion with the despatch of a telegram of good wishes to the organisers of the Exhibition of Iranian Art at the National Library in Paris. This exhibition has apparently not been approved by the Shah. / 3. Roumanian Interests. A special memorial service for Her Majesty the late Queen Mother of Roumania was held in the American Church, Tehran, on Sunday, the 24th July. The Iranian Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister and all heads of missions, were present with their staffs. 4. Iranian A rmy. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 8 (current), paragraph 9. The new military barracks at Khwash (million sheet No. 30, square B 4) have been completed. [389 p—1]2 4 r The barracks at Zahidan (Duzdap) (million sheet No. 30, square 3 A) and Zabul (million sheet No. 30, square B 1 ) are also nearing completion. The new barracks form part of the new reconstruction work in the port of Chahbar (million sheet No. 31, square 3 A). (ii) The majority of range-finders now in use in the Iranian army were /-i ^ supplied by the well-known S.O.M. of Paris. (iii) It is reliably reported that all obsolete guns of the 10th Artillery Regiment, 8 th (Mekran) Division, have been replaced by new Skoda armament. Some of the obsolete guns have been allotted to the garrisons of Chahbar and Bakhshan (degree sheet No. 31 I, square B 3). (iv) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current), paragraph 12. From a consular source it is reported that several new Iranian cavalry observation posts have been established on the Irano-Russian frontier in Khorasan. (v) the great majority of the military garrisons, both of Tehran and the provinces, are now in camp in the hills adjacent to their permanent stations. From camp they are carrying out platoon, company and battalion training and field firing. The artillery of the Central Garrison has been practising almost daily with live shells in the foothills west of Tehran and Tarsabad (million sheet No. 9, square D 1). 5. The Iranian Air Force. (i) On the afternoon of the 21st June a demonstration was given by the five new “ Tiger-Moth ” machines referred to in paragraph 1 in formation flying by Sarwan (Captain) Afghami and five sergeant pilots in the presence of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. A British eye-witness states that the performance was carried out with skill, and reflects great credit on the progress made by pilots of the Iranian air force during the past two years. His Imperial Majesty the Shah appeared to be liverish when he arrived at the aerodrome, but on conclusion of the demonstration referred to expressed his satisfaction and left the aerodrome with a broad smile. (ii) It is reliably reported that the air squadron at Meshed will be expanded into a regiment (No. 4 Regiment) as soon as new machines become available. (iii) Fuselages and airframes for ten new machines (five De Havilland “ Tiger-moth ” and five “ Hawker Audax ”) are now under construction at the Iranian Aircraft Factory at Shahbaz, Doshantappeh. It is reported that the fuselages and airframes for these “ Tiger-Moths are expected to be completed within three months. It is understood that the engines are already in stock. 6 . Communications. (A) Railways. —(i) Rapid progress is being made with the laying of the track on the remaining section of the Trans-Iranian railroad. Rails are being laid at the rate of 3 kilom. per day. There now remains only 80 kilom. to complete. The expected junction of the line is forecast for the 25th August. (ii) Five locomotives of German manufacture were recently delivered at Bandar Shah. They were immediately driven to the locomotive sheds at Sari. (iii) A complete list of the stations on the Tehran-Bandar Shah line, together with the present timings for passenger trains is given as an appendix to this summary^ 1 ) (B) Roads. —The new road from Zahidan (million sheet No. 30, square A 3) to Khwash (million sheet No. 30, square A 4) via Qwarkuh (million sheet No. 30, square C 3) is reported to be good for the first 70 miles and then takes to the nullah bed. This road is 12 miles shorter than the Khwash-Zahidan road via Mirjawa and Ladis, which, although very well constructed, is narrow. Water is available every 25 miles on both roads. 7. The Anylo-Iranian Oil Company. (i) The annual report of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has been published and has caused general satisfaction. This shows an extra million pounds in royalties and taxation over the figures for the previous year. (0 Not printed.3 7 A As it appears to be the company’s intention to develop the new oil areas discovered at Gach Saran (degree sheet No. 10 J, square D 4) and Naft-i-Safid near Haft Khel (million sheet No. 10 , square B 1 ), this increase in royalties is likely to continue. All moneys derived from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company sources are ear- J^iarked for Iranian army expenditure. (ii) The internal demand for petrol and oil has diminished considerably recently owing to the decrease of lorry traffic. The majority of the 250 oil tankers belonging to the company are lying idle. 8 . Refugees. (i) Reference Intelligence Summaries Nos. 9, 10 and 15 (current), para graphs 8 and 10 . During the period under review a further batch of 954 deported Iranian subjects arrived in Bandar Pahlavi. This makes the total number of deportees nearly 9,000. (ii) Nineteen families of Turks exiled from U.S.S.R. (Bokara) have passed through Iran on their way to Taurus. (iii) A consular report from Meshed states that many of the recently- deported refugees now state that had they known what was in store for them in Iran they would have willingly adopted Russian citizenship and so at least would have been able to retain their household effects. 9. Tribal. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 12 (current), paragraph 12. It is confirmed that Malik Ali Shah Khan, the Narui Sirdar, and his followers have now been completely evacuated to Zabul (million sheet No. 30, square B 1 ). 10 . Road Traffic. Owing to the decrease in trade and the lowness of the present fixed rates which make it impossible for lorry owners to make a profit, there is much less lorry traffic on the main roads throughout the country. With the approaching junction of the Trans-Iranian Railway freights, too, will be carried by the railroad. 11. Industry. It is reported from consular sources that visitors who previously had been welcomed are not now allowed to enter any factory without the formal permission of the Department of Industry. Cases have occurred both at Yezd and Isfahan of visitors being refused permission. A rumour attributes this to fear of Russian sabotage. 12. Harvest. The present harvest is above the average and is estimated to be sufficient for the needs of the country for two years. This will enable the Government to store sufficient reserves of grain in the newly-constructed silos and also to export to Germany. 13. The Iranian Press. Recently the Iranian press have fiercely attacked the French press, especially for an article in the Paris daily, L’Intransigeant, entitled : “ Although the Shah said no, the exhibition was held all the same.” The article in question refers to the recent exhibition of Persian art held in Paris. 13. Military Publications. Issue No. 6 of Volume II of the Piyada Nizam (Infantry Journal) contains nothing of interest to the General Staff. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

Tehran, August 13, 1938. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 17 for the Period ending August 13, 1938. 1 . The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince and a small personal staff, left Tehran for a few days’ rest at his estate at Kalar Rustaq near Chains (degree sheet 8 P, square B 2). From there he inspected the harbour construction work at Nan Shahr. The work, which is being carried out by a Dutch company, is expected to be finished in two months. The harbour will be able to accommodate any of the Russian vessels plying in the Caspian Sea. The estate of Kalar Rustaq formerly belonged to the late Mohammad Wall Khan Sepah Salar, and was confiscated to His Majesty some years ago. The mansion house has been entirely renovated and great improvements made in the agricultural wealth of the estate. On his return His Majesty proceeded at once to his palace at Saadabad. 2. Iranian Officials. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 16 (current), paragraph 2 (ii). His Excellency Mohammad Ismail Merat, a former Governor of Kerman and lately supervisor of Iranian students in Europe, has been appointed acting Minister of Education, vice Ali Ashgar Hikmat (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 78; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 98), dismissed. The new acting Minister is reported to be a hard worker, but does not possess the experience or capabilities^ of his predecessor. It is stated that His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince interceded with his father on behalf of Hikmat, but without success. (ii) His Excellency Baqr Kazemi (Muhazzib-ud-Dowleh) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 104; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 107), Ustander of No. Ill Ustan (Western Azerbaijan) has been appointed Iranian Ambassador in Afghanistan. 3. British Interests. (i) His Excellency Mr. H. J. Seymour, C.M.G., C.V.O., His Majesty’s Minister, returned to Tehran from leave on the 6 th August. (ii) Squadron-Leader F. Workman, M.C., chief British representative at the Shahbaz Aircraft Factory at Doshantappeh aerodrome, has been dismissed. On the 9th August Squadron-Leader Workman was summoned to the Ministry of War, where he was informed that his services were no longer required. He was given three months’ salary in lieu of notice and free passages for his- wife and himself. Mr. F. Knight is now senior Hawker representative. [389 gg—1]•2 4. Afghan Interests. The military attache, Kabul, reports an increase in anti-British propaganda, culminating in the publication of a scurrilous newspaper article in the official Islah of Kabul. Apparently the Afghan Government hope to direct the attention of thej rebellious tribes in the Southern Province and Katawaz towards the British, and to rid themselves of the accusation that their policy is pro-British. The article in question, said to have been drafted by the Foreign Minister himself, has been read with interest by the general public, and has also been the main topic of conversation among members of the Diplomatic Corps. It is said that the Iranian Embassy were very interested in the article and obtained a great deal of satisfaction from its publication, as did also the German Legation. The Russians, however, fear that any decrease of British influence in Afghanistan will result in a corresponding increase of German influence in that country. From a German source in Tehran it is stated that Italian propaganda is the cause of most of the anti-British and anti-Government feeling there. This German source goes on to say that the Italians desire to turn out the present ruling family of Afghanistan and set up one of ex-King Amanullah’s family instead, with a view to causing trouble on the North-West Frontier in the event of war, &amp;c. 5. The Iranian Army. (i) It is reported from reliable sources that the 50 (Brandt) 81-millim. mortars and a quantity of mortar ammunition have been delivered in Tehran. An order for thirty more (Brandt) mortars has been placed. A course of instruction in their use is being organised. (ii) Extracts from amendments to the Law of Promotion in the Iranian Army are attached as an appendix( J ) to this summary. 6 . The Iranian Air Force.. (i) Parachutes used by the Iranian air force are of Italian manufacture (Salvatora). They are attached to the fuselage and open up themselves when the pilot jumps. If this fails to function the airman can himself pull the usual cord in front of his waist. Each pilot has his own parachute. A special staff trained in Italy open up, overhaul and repack all parachutes every ten days. No parachute jumping is practised. (ii) Indoor instruction in aerial bombing is given to all pilots on an electrically-controlled and revolving miniature relief landscape. It is said to be of British manufacture. Aerial photography is also taught indoors. (iii) It is reported from a reliable source that the aerial cameras used by the Iranian air force are of British manufacture (Eagle III?). The Williams camera gun is used for instruction in aerial gunnery. 7. Refugees. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 16 (current), paragraph 8 . During the period under review approximately 9,000 more deported Iranian subjects arrived at Astara and Bandar Pahlavi. This now makes the total number of deportees just over 18,000. (ii) A National Relief Fund has been opened, and all firms and private individuals are being pressed to subscribe. His Imperial Majesty the Shah has himself donated 50,000 rials (£625) and His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince 10,000 rials (£125). Nothing is published in the press about these deportations, except the bare news of fresh arrivals. 8 . Irano-Turkish Frontier. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), paragraph 8 . The mixed commission has now adjourned and the Iranian members thereof have returned to Tehran from Trebizond. 9. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. (i) Oil in.good and promising quantities has been discovered at Lali, north east of Shushtar and 5 miles from the Karun River (degree sheet 9 H, M.N. 555993). (*) Not printed.(ii) It is reliably reported that the Bank-i-Mellie (National Bank) have arranged tor the grant of a revolving credit of about £500,000 from the oil company. Ihe security offered consists of shares mostly industrial—Skodas, &amp;c. ihe purpose of the loan is unknown. ' &gt;. Industry. A factory for the manufacture of glycerine is being constructed close to the cement works at Shahr Rey (Shah Abdul Azim) ( million sheet No. 9 , square D 1 ). Most of the machinery (German) has been installed and the remainder is expected shortly. The capacity of the factory is at present unknown. 11. The Press. Recently the Ministry of linance vigorously denied the report of a Beirut newspaper, the Jour, which stated that the German Government had obtained a concession to exploit the iron mines of Iran in exchange for 30 million reichsmarks.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 18 for the period ended the 27th August, compiled by the military attach^ to this legation. Tehran, August 31. 1938. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 18 for the Period ended August 27, 1938. 1 . The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, Cabinet Ministers, high officials, leading merchants and bankers, proceeded by special trains to Sefid Cheshme, 68 kilom. south of Iraq (Sultanabad), for the official inauguration of the Trans-Iranian Railway which took place on the afternoon of Friday, the 26th August. His Majesty the Shah and the Crown Prince themselves tightened the last bolts and nuts; His Majesty then cut a tri-colour ribbon and declared the Trans- Iranian open. Afterwards the “specials” left for the capital, which they reached not without difficulty. The royal train remained at Iraq (Sultanabad) during the night and arrived at Tehran at 17 • 00 hours on the following afternoon, where His Majesty was received at the station by the Government, the Diplomatic Corps and thousands of the populace. His Majesty, on descending from his carriage, inspected a guard of honour with band of the 1 st (Pahlavi) Regiment, dressed in full field-service order with steel helmets. During the reading of a congratulatory address the first through passenger train from Bandar Shahpur arrived, closely followed by the first goods train, which was made up of oil tankers and freight wagons. The Shah, although looking somewhat tired, greeted various members of the Diplomatic Corps warmly and continuously acknowledged the cheering of the crowds. He then left immediately for the royal palace. The completion of the Trans-Iranian Railway is entirely due to the relentless determination of the Shah. A magnificent engineering achievement, it now remains to be seen whether its economic value to the country will justify the enormous expenditure incurred. It is possible that the southern section (Bandar Shahpur-Ahwaz-Tehran) will eventually pay its way, but it is doubtful whether the northern section (Tehran-Bandar Shah) will ever do so. The construction of a number of branch lines is contemplated. They are as follows :— (i) Tehraii-Tabriz—Turkish frontier. (ii) Tehran-Semnan-Meshed. (iii) Qum-Anarak. (iv) Sultanabad-Isfahan.

The Trans-Iranian Railway was officially completed by His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Crown Prince at 17 00 hours on Friday, the 26th August, at Sefid Cheshme, near Iraq (Sultanabad). -r, j ^ The line which runs from Bandar Shah in the north to Bandar Shahpur i the south was begun on the 15th October, 1927, and was completed on the 19 August 1938. A total of about ten years and eleven months. °The total length of the line is 1,394-160 kilom. The cost of its construction is approximately 2,400 million rials (nearly £30 million). t&gt; r u In 1927 the work of construction was entrusted to an American-1 ohsn combine, who drew up the first plans and began the construction of the line between Bandar Shahpur and Ahwaz. Their work was found unsatisfactory and ihe Iranian Government continued the work themselves for two years, with the assistance of foreign railway experts. This, too was found unsatisfactory^ Thereafter, the construction contract was awarded to the well-known .|4 anis ^ railway construction engineers, Messrs. Kampmann, Kierulfi and baxild and Messrs. Saabye and Larche, and a Swedish firm, Messrs. Nydovist and Holm, locomotive construction engineers, under the title of Consortium Kampsax Consortium Kampsax, on receiving the contract, immediately divided tne line into lots and sub-contracted the work out to different firms, both foreign and Ii*cinicLH t Two British firms, Messrs. Richard Costains (Limited) and Messrs. Nuttall, Mowlem, Sons and Co. completed lots 6 and 7 respectively in Lunstan, south of Iraq (Sultanabad), where enormously difficult tunnelling, &amp;c., was involved. These were perhaps the toughest sections of the whole line. Under Consortium Kampsax the work of construction has been carried out methodically and thoroughly. The line has actually been completed six months ahead of the contract date. x ^ , The section Bandar Shah (Caspian seaport) to Tehran presented serious engineering problems, the line having to be brought up from the Caspian Sea fbelow sea level) to the Iranian Plateau, crossing the Elburz range of mountains at a height of 2 109-10 metres. Ninety-three tunnels had to be excavated and numerous viaducts and bridges constructed. The longest tunnel on this section is 2 883 metres in length. A large force of Italian and Swiss expert labour was eraplo^edcfor^e tunneUing Di^ui i^ (gultanabad) section through the moun- tains of Luristan was also extremely difficult : 131 tunnels had to be constructed, the maioritv having to be blasted out of solid rock. The longest tunnel is near Chahar Darreh, and is 2.526 metres in length in the shape of a hOTS ^ ho e- More than 10,000 tons of explosives have been used and between 40,000 and 50 000 Iranians have been continuously employed as labourers. Experiments with seven different types of foreign-make locomotives are being made Locomotives supplied by Messrs. Beyer-Peacock and Co. (Limited) of Manchester and Nahab of Sweden are being used m the mountainous sections. (*) Not printed./ 3 The latest locomotives are, however, being supplied by Messrs. Ferrostahl of Germany. The total number of locomotives in the country and on order is said to be in ^he region of 132. There are 1,167 other rolling-stock units consisting of passenger coaches, postal vans, restaurant cars, oil tankers and goods wagons of all types. A further 1,130 units have been ordered, mostly from Germany. Experiments are now being carried out with Diesel electric motor coaches between Tehran and Qum. The total number of bridges on the Trans-Iranian Railway is 4,872. 115,000 tons of rail track have been laid and over 2 million sleepers (steel and wood) have been used. Strategically, the line is important, as it will now be possible for the central garrison to reinforce Luristan and Khuzistan (oil-fields) within twenty-four hours and Mazanderan (northern section) within twelve hours. A brief description of the country through which the Trans-Iranian Railway passes will be given in the next summary. 4. Communications. Roads. —(i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 9 (current), paragraph 6 . The new Bandar Pahlavi-Astara road (million sheet No. 9, square A 2) is not yet ready for traffic. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 11 (current), paragraph 5. More than 6,000 labourers are employed in widening the Tehran-Kerej-Chalus road— called “ the Special Road.” (iii) The road between Resht and Bandar Pahlavi is being completely realigned and widened. Tunnels .—The Kandawan tunnel is already closed as several falls have occurred therein owing to water pressure. Bridges .—Reference Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current), para graph 13 (i). Two modern bridges of reinforced concrete have been constructed between Ghazian (degree sheet No. 8 G, square B 3) and Mian Pushtah Island and between Mian Pushtah Island and Bandar Pahlavi itself. A section of these bridges can be hoisted by means of electrically-controlled machinery to allow of the passage of sailing vessels and steamers. Harbours .—It is reported from a consular source that Messrs. Sentab (Scan dinavians) have been given the contract for the construction of a deep-water wharf in the Shatt el Arab near Khurramshahr. It is stated that this wharf will be about 2 miles up-river from the junction of the Karun with the Shatt el Arab, where there is deep water inshore. The wharf is to be of concrete and will take about two years to construct. It is to be 150 metres long. Warehouses, roads and a light railway are to be constructed from the wharf to Khurramshahr. 5. U.S.S.R. Interests. The Soviet Government despatched four small warships into Iranian terri torial waters off Bandar Pahlavi at 06 • 00 hours on the 21st August. They were clearly visible from the shore steaming in a westerly direction. Their sudden appearance caused consternation. The Iranian Government have despatched a formal protest to the Soviet Government. It is stated that this demonstration was made because a German firm of contractors had secured a contract for harbour improvements, &amp;c., at Bandar Pahlavi. The Government of the U.S.S.R. state that this is contrary to article 2 of an exchange of notes on Bandar Pahlavi and the Caspian shores dated 1927. The Iranian Government deny this, and have offered to accept arbitration on the point at issue. The Soviet Government have declined. It is considered that the Soviet Government are not likely to be tractable over any questions involving German industrial interests in Iran. The four Russian warships are reported to belong to the Black Sea Flotilla and had been sent specially to the Caspian, via the Sea of Azov and the Volga canal s The matter is under discussion between the two Governments concerned. 6 . German Interests. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 12 (current), paragraph 17. It is reliably reported that the Iranian Government have cancelled the German con- [414 q—2] B ^4 cession for the working of the Anarak mining area (million sheet No. 16, square B 2 ). No reason is given for this action. A member of the German Legation claims that the German Government is not disturbed about this, as Germany was only interested in nickel. Actually, very little of this metal hap-*^ been mined at Anarak to date; besides, the transport of the ore is very costly aniG~' on the whole the proposition is not a paying one. (ii) Colonel Hans Rohde, German military and air attache at Angora, arrived in Tehran on the 6 th August. He is also accredited to Athens. He expects to remain a month in the capital. 7. The Iranian Army. (i) A consular report states that a new regiment, strength about 650, is being formed at Khwash (Mekran). This may be a new camelry regiment. (ii) His Imperial Majesty the Shah has given instructions to the Minister of War that no foreign military attaches are to attend the manoeuvres of the central garrison which are to be held during September. (iii) Tenders were called for in the press recently for the repair of 140 sliding- door garages for A.F.V.’s and motor transport belonging to the 2nd Division. These garages are at Eshratabad barracks about 2 miles north-west of Tehran. (iv) An unconfirmed but fairly reliable report states that the Ministry of War are negotiating with Germany for the purchase of further artillery. The order is said to be for fifty 4-gun batteries of mountain guns and fifty 4-gun batteries of anti-aircraft guns of the “ pom-pom ” type. (v) The artillery ammunition reserve supplies for Bofors and Skoda guns in the country are reported to be approximately 1,000 rounds per gun. 8 . The Iranian A ir Force. (i) A course in aerial navigation is being held at Mehrabad military aero drome. This is a subject of which the large majority of Iranian pilots are totallv ignorant. (ii) Orders have been placed in Germany for the supply of an unknown number of motor vehicles fitted with searchlight equipment for flood-lighting aerodromes at night. Instruction in night flying for pilots of the Iranian air force is said to be commencing shortly. 9. Boy Scouts. . (i) His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, Chief Scout of Iran, visited the scout camp at Manzrieh near Tehran on Tuesday, the 23rd August. A display of gymnastic exercises and scout-craft was given. (ii) The boy scouts and girl guides of Tehran are, on the whole, well and correctly turned'out in khaki and green uniforms respectively. 10. Civil Aviation. (i) According to press reports the Iraqi Government have purchased three of the latest type of passenger aircraft, each carrying six passengers. These air craft will be used on a regular weekly air service between Bagdad-Kermanshah- Tehran and vice versa by the Iraq Air Union Company. It is stated that this service will commence in the autumn. (ii) The Iranian Government propose to enlarge the present landing ground at Hamadan (million sheet No. 9, square A 2). Its present dimensions are 40,000 square metres, which are to be enlarged to 100,000 square metres. Special runways are to be constructed so that the landing ground can be used all the year round. 11. Railways—Qishlaq {Garmsar)-Semnan Branch. (i) The work on this branch line is progressing satisfactorily : the first lot has been completed and 9,000 workmen are engaged on the remaining lots. This branch line is expected to be open by March 1939. (ii) An order has been secured by a German firm to supply spare parts and brakes for the rolling-stock of the Trans-Iranian Railway. The value of the order is said to be in the region of £40,000. The firm insists that payment shall5 be made in foreign currency and not under the barter agreement already existing between Germany and Iran. (iii) Sixty-five locomotives and 1,100 rolling-stock have been delivered at ^TSandar Shahpur. All of German manufacture. (iv) A complete list of stations on the northern and southern sections of the Trans-Iranian Railway, giving kilometrage, distance between stations and altitude, is attached as Appendix Ilf 1 ) to this summary.

Tehran. September 14. 1938 (Secret.) Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 19 for the Period ending September 10, 1938. 1 . The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah is again in residence at the Saadabad Palace. A few days ago His Majesty personally decorated a number of Iranian officials and empfoyees of Consortium Kampsax as a mark of Royal appreciation on the completion of the Trans-Iranian Railway. Amongst those who received decorations were Mr. J. Saxild, general manager of Consortium Kampsax (2nd Class Imperial Order), and his Excellency Majid Ahi, Minister of Roads and Communications ( 1 st Class Imperial Order). Congratulatory messages on the completion of the Trans-Iranian Railway continue to arrive from foreign States. 2. Iranian Officials. His Excellency Muzaffar Alam, Minister for Foreign Affairs (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 10; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 2), left Tehran for Geneva by Deutsche Lufthansa to attend a meeting of the League of Nations. Following the League Assembly, the second annual meeting of the signatories of the Saadabad Pact will take place. This meeting was originally arranged to take place at Kabul, but was changed to Geneva in consequence of the League Assembly. It is expected also that the Iranian Foreign Minister will arrange a meeting with M. Litvinov, the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs, in order to discuss the present strained relations between the two countries. 3. French Interests. (i) It is reported that the French Government have inaugurated a new broadcasting station at Beirut (288 m. 50). This station broadcasts in French and Arabic from 12-30 hours to 13-30 hours and from 18-00 hours to 20-00 hours daily. Listeners in Tehran report good reception. The possibility of short broadcasts in Persian has been mentioned. (ii) No French professors are now employed under the Ministry of Education. 4. Iraqi Interests. No mention has been made in the Iranian press of the establishment of a Government Serai at Qala Diza (million sheet No. 1 , square B 4) in the Pizhder Kurd area. Recently, certain troop movements were cerried out in the Sauj Bulagh- Rezaieh area (million sheet No. 1 , squares B 3 and 4). It is believed, but not2 confirmed, that this was due to the reorganisation of the III and V Divisional areas in accordance with the new Civil Administrative Areas (see Appendix A to Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current)). According to a Royal Air Force report, the 24th Regiment at Sardasht (million sheet No. 1 , square B 4) and the 14th Cavalry Regiment at Saqqiz (million sheet No. 1 , square C 4), both of the 5th (Senneh) Division, are to be brought under the command of the 3rd (Western Azerbaijan) Division at Rezaieh. The 27th Regiment at Tabriz, 4th (Eastern Azerbaijan) Division, is to be transferred to Senneh (million sheet No. 2, square D 4). 5. Turkish Interests. (i) Captain d'Etat-Major Jelal Orge, the Turkish military attache, left Tehran for Turkey on completion of his tenure of appointment on the 6 th September. Captain d'Etat-Major Jemal Sandjak has succeeded him. (ii) Nothing has been published in the Iranian press about the projected military expedition into the Dersim Kurd country. 6 . German Interests. (i) An application for employment in a British wireless station stated to be at Ras Musandam (million sheet No. 25, square A 2) has been received in the legation from two young Austrians (Jews). It appears that the applicants read an article in the Viennese press describing this station as an important link in British communications, but emphasising it as being one of the hottest places in the world. The article went on to say that the station had been temporarily closed down owing to the terrible climatic conditions prevailing and that no one would serve there. The Austrians were most anxious to try! (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 18 (current), paragraph 11 (n). A consular report states that twelve German railway fitters have arrived at Ahwaz to assemble the new rolling-stock recently arrived from Germany. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 18 (current), paragraph 4 (harbours). Messrs. Sentab have engaged several Germans for the construction of the new wharf. _ __ (iv) The German military and air attache (Colonel Hans Rohde) paid a visit by air to Kabul. It is believed that this visit was made in connexion with orders for artillery. Colonel Rohde is not accredited to Afghanistan. 7. .4 nglo-Iranian Oil Company. The German firm B.A.M.A.G. are erecting an Iso Octane plant at Abadan. Within the past few months about twenty-five Germans and Italians, previously employed on the Trans-Iranian Railway, have been taken on by the Anglo-Iiaman Oil Company. 8 . Iranian Baluchistan. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 12 (current), paragraph 11. It is reported from a reliable source that great efforts are being made to disarm the tribesmen in Mekran and Seistan. This is confirmed by a report from the Intelligence Bureau, Quetta, which states that all leading Sirdars of the Dizzak area (degree sheet 31 I, square B 3) were recently summoned to Khwash by the military ^authorities, and were instructed to use their influence to compel Baluchis to surrender their arms. Each Sirdar was ordered to produce at least 100 rifles. This they promised to do, and on this condition they were allowed to return to their homes. 9. Irano-Baluchistan Frontier. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 12 (current), paragraph 20, and Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current), paragraph 11. Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau reports that after the release of the Iranian Amnieh (Road Guards), they were sent to Chahbar and then to Khwash, where each was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment.[439 f—2] B 2 3 (ii) In July several Iranian officials arrived at Kastag (degree sheet ol G, square D 1) to meet the assistant political agent, Mekran, to discuss boundary affairs and to obtain information regarding the reputation of Nail) Durrani. They saw the Risaldar in command of Maud Post (Mekran Levy Corps) as. unfortunately, the assistant political agent was indisposed. 10. The Trans-Iranian Railway. (i) His Imperial Majesty the Shah has given orders that the station Sefid Cheshmeh. near which the completion ceremony of the I rans-Iraman Railway took place, will be renamed Fowzieh Station in honour of Her Royal Highness Princess Fowzieh of Egypt, fiancee of His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince^ (ii) As a result of the successful completion of the railway, the Ministry ot Roads and Communications are suffering from “ swelled heads. aie insisting that they themselves construct the easiest sections of the new leni an- Kazvin-Tabriz-Turkish frontier line, and that Consortium Kampsax should do the mountainous sections. Kampsax are not prepared to agree to this at piesent. No work beyond survey has yet been carried out on this section. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 18 (current), paragraph 6. A brief description of the country through which the Trans-Iranian Railway runs is attached as an appendix to this summary. 11. The Iranian Army. (i) The 22nd Cavalrv Regiment at Zabul (million sheet No. 30. square B 1) are to have their lines reconstructed. Four roofed stables (capacity 148 horses each), water troughs, grain stores and a veterinary dispensary and omce are to be kuilh j - h barbed-wire fence is being erected round the whole of Doshantappeh Aerodrome and the Shahbaz aircraft factory. I he facton is being considerably enlarged to house further machinery which, it is understood. has been ordered from England. , (iii) The 1st and 2nd Infantry Regiments of the Tehran Garrison are known officially as the Pahlevi Guard Regiment and the Ahanm Guard Regiment respec \ if i s reported that the paucity of volunteer students for the officers’ school (Daneshkeda-i-Afsari) in Tehran and the military cadet colleges (Dabiristan-i- Nizam) in the provinces is acute and causing concern. Advertisements appear dailv in the press setting forth the conditions and qualifications necessary tor these establishments. Educational authorities, too, are pressing parents to allow their sons to join. The Iranian air force officers’ technical training college and the n.c.os. school of the Amnieh (Road Guards) are also very much under strength. ( v ) Summer training camps have now broken up and the troops ha\e, m most cases, returned to barracks. The troops of the Central Garrison are preparing for manoeuvres. . , (vi) Recently, the Intendance Service Headquarters asked for tenders tor the supply of a large number of barrack-room tables and benches. 12. Refugees. Iranian deportees continue to arrive from the l .S.S.R. During the period under review, a further 1,188 arrived at Bandar Pahlevi, Julfa and Bajgnan (million sheet No. 22 , square C 3). The total now stands at approximately 20 , 000 . A number of deported Iranian subjects have been drafted to Hamadan. where there is a shortage of labour for public work construction. 13. The Press. (i) Two Arabic newspapers published in Iraq mentioned that negotiations were taking place between Iran and England for a loan of £5 million. The official press firmly denied this by stating that Iran had no need of loans. (ii) The News Review of the 28th July published an article entitled the “ Shah’s Railwav.” This caused intense anger in the official press. The Times of the 27th August, by its reference in a leader on the I rans-Iranian Railway to the Shah as an ex-Cossack, did not enhance its lepntation foi tact.4 14. British Interests. Major J. B. Cunningham, Royal Indian Army Service Corps, a language student who arrived in Isfahan in June, was ordered by the police, acting presumably on instructions from Tehran, to leave Iran within forty-eight houis No reason was given. Urgent representations were made to the Acting Ministei for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister, and it was decided that Major Cunningham should be permitted to come to Tehran, where the case would be discussed H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Military Attache. Gulhek, September 10, 1938. Appendix to Enclosure. The Trans-Iranian Railway. REFERENCE Intelligence Summary No. 18 (current), paragraph 3. I he following is a brief description of the country through which the I rans-Iranian Railway passes :— The line commences at Bandar Shah, a small port at the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea on the edge of the Gurgan steppes, whence it runs along the green and fertile plain of Mazanderan through the small towns of Behshahr (Ashraf), Sari and Shahi. where there are cotton mills. It then turns south and enters the winding valley of the Talur River until it reaches Pul-i-Sefid Station. Here the ascent of the Elburz Mountains begins. After traversing innumerable tunnels and zig-zagging up the steep mountain sides, the line crosses the Firouzkuh Pass at a height of 2,100 metres; it then descends the Hableh Rud Valley into the Veramin Plain, when it takes a westerly course as far as Tehran. From Tehran the line goes south to Qum and then passes through the undulating country between Qum and Iraq (Sultanabad). Between Iraq and Do Roud (Bahrein) it passes through a hilly region, at Nourabad Station reaching a height of 2,173 metres above sea level. The line then follows the Ab-i-Diz Rivers through the gorges of the Luristan Range for over 100 kilom., passing through tunnels and across bridges and viaducts, even more formidable than those on the Elburz section. After Andimeshk (Salehabad) the line emerges on to the vast Khuzistan Plain, passing through Dizful and Ahwaz, where it crosses the Karun River and continues over flat country until it reaches the Persian Gulf at Bandar Shahpur, its southern terminus. The total length of the Trans-Iranian Railway is 1,394-160 kilom., of which 150 kilom. in the north and 159 kilom. in the south was almost insurmountable mountain ranges, over which the line was constructed in the face of tremendous engineering difliculties. From the physical, geographical and climatic point of view, the Trans- Iranian Railway can be divided into eight sections, which are as follows 1 . The section between Bandar Shah and Shahi, a distance of 127 kilom., comprises the well-watered Mazanderan Plain. This region has a mild and moist heat and is very favourable for agriculture. Its principal products are rice and tobacco. New factories for silk, cotton spinning, &amp;c., have recently been started, so a brilliant industrial future is anticipated. The small seaside port of Babul Sar (Meshed-i-Sar) is also being developed into a holiday resort. 2. The section between Shahi and Gadouk, a distance of 114 kilom., comprises the district on the northern slopes of the Elburz Range. Here the climate is mild and verv moist owing to the heavy rainfall. The mountain sides are covered with thick forests and undergrowth, the principal agricultural products being rice and barley; seams of coal also exist. Large flocks of sheep, goats and cattle are grazed on the higher slopes of the mountains in the summer, and are driven down to the Gurgan steppes in the winter.irM ^ le sectl ? n between Gadouk and Garmsar (Qishlaq), a distance of 1 )4 kilom., comprises the southern slopes of the Elburz Range. Owing to the heat and scarcity of water, there is very little vegetation. A little barley and wheat is piodueed in the valley of the Habli Rud; thereafter the region is uncultivated. | . e sec ‘tion Garmsar (Qishlaq)-Tehran-Iraq (Sultanabad), a distance 4 o 9 kilom., comprises the Central Iranian plateau with a very dry and continental climate. Cultivation is only carried out where there is water. ^ ^ be . section Iraq (Sultanabad)-Do Rond (Bahrein), a distance of 147 kilom., is situated in a hilly region; the highest point which the line passes is at Nourabad Station (2,173 metres); the climate in this section is milder but very dry. Heavy snow-falls occur in winter. Cereals are cultivated in the valleys whenever there is sufficient water for irrigation. 6 . Between Do Roud (Bahrein) and Shahbazan. a distance of 138 kilom., the line passes through a very rugged district of the main Luristan Range. This section of the line was the most difficult and costly of all to construct, as numerable tunnels, viaducts and bridges had to be built over and along the gorges of the Ab-i-Diz River and one of its tributaries. The climate is very hot and dry in summer and intensely cold in winter. There is little cultivation. The tribesmen graze their flocks on the higher slopes in the summer. 7. The section between Shahbazan and Andimeshk (Salehabad), a distance of 74 kilom., is moderately fertile. The climate is hot and dry. 8 . Andimeshk (Salehabad) and Bandar Shahpur, a distance of 250 kilom. After crossing the Bala Rud and Ab-i-Di^ Rivers, the line traverses the main Khuzistan Plain. At Ahwaz it crosses the Karun River by a steel bridge and finally reaches the mud flats on which the port of Bandar Shahpur is built.I# *ny further communication on this subiec\ please quit ^ No C -] \ iEn and address —not to any person by \ame.

Leese, Bt., D.S.O., the Coldstream Guards, and Lady Leese arrived by Deutsche Lufthansa on the 11 th September, and left for Kabul by the same air line en route to Quetta on the 17th September. 5. The Iranian Army. (i) Troops of the 1 st and 2 nd Divisions (Tehran Garrison) carried out manoeuvres from the 11 th to 14th September in the area Varamin-Qishlaq (million sheet No. 9, square D 1 ) about 30 miles south-east of Tehran. His Imperial Majesty the Shah was present on the final two days. With the exception of the new Turkish military attache, no foreign military attaches, nor officers of the French Military Mission, were invited to attend. Most of the G.O.C’s. of provincial divisions were present. No mention of the manoeuvres appeared in the press. According to a reliable report, only 10,000 troops took part this year. A new feature was the use made of a small mechanised column by one of the forces. This consisted of infantry, tanks and some artillery. It is said to have been used with great success. It may be mentioned that the country of the manoeuvre area is mostly flat and in some parts marshy, presenting no great difficulties for a mechanised column. Two squadrons of aircraft took part in the manoeuvres. [439 o—l](ii) It is reported from a reliable source that the Divisional Signals has been reorganised. Each division has two signal companies which form part of the Engineer Battalion. They are organised as follows :— No. 1 Signal (Construction) Company, consisting of Four Sections. No. 1 Section (Construction). —Equipped with field telephone cable on hand drums. No. 2 Section (Construction). —Equipped with field telephone cable on hand drums. No. 3 Section (Construction). —Equipped with cable-laying horsed vehicles. No. 4 Section (Communications). —Equipped with sixty sets of field telephones.

There are now two courses, one of three years’ duration and the other of six years. Students are volunteers, and must be between the ages of 17-22. Students of the three years’ course are accommodated, fed and clothed free and receive 60 rials (15s.) per month pocket money. Students of the six-year course receive 120 rials (£1 10 s.). On the successful completion of these courses they are commissioned third and second lieutenants respectively. (iv) Messrs. Bofors of Sweden have brought out two of their latest pattern anti-aircraft guns, 40 mm. It is reported that their experts will demonstrate these guns to the Army Purchasing Committee within a few days. 6 . Security. From three different consular reports it is stated that plain-clothes detectives of the Criminal Investigation Department are now stationed at the post boxes of certain towns (Tabriz, Isfahan and Zahidan) to examine the addresses on all letters posted. The receipt of anonymous letters addressed to His Imperial Majesty the Shah is said to be reason for this procedure. 7. Tribal. Qashqai and Kuhgalu .—A consular report states that during August, as a result of spasmodic acts of banditry, it was decided to despatch two small punitive columns (strength about two regiments of cavalry and a battalion of infantry each) from Shiraz and Ahwaz respectively into the difficult mountainous country in the Shulistan area (million sheet No.' 10 , square D 2 ). This area has been difficult to control for some years. The Shiraz column left Shiraz by night and advanced along the Shiraz- Ardakan (million sheet No. 10 , square D 2)-Tal-i-Khosrovi (Diz-i-Khurd) road. The southern column advanced by Behbehan (million sheet No. 10 , square C 2 ) by a new military road, passing through Diz Mardan (million sheet No. 10 , square C 2 ) to Tal-i-Khosrovi. The tribesmen were completely surprised and the majority of the bandits were captured. This small expedition, although unimportant, proves the efficiency of the new military road systems which have been gradually built up within the past three years in tribal territory. The roads are only fit for light motor traffic in good weather, and are reserved entirely for troops. Both last year and this year the plan carried out was to trap the tribesmen between a northern and southern force, and for the second time it was completely successful. The operations were also carried out with great secrecy and efficiency. It has been decided to establish a small garrison permanently at Tal-i-Khosrovi, and barracks are already being constructed there. For this, too, workmen were secretly drafted in from Isfahan, and not from Shiraz.3 8 . British Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 (current), paragraph 14. Major J. B. Cunningham, Royal Indian Army Service Corps, language student, has now been permitted to remain in Tehran and is continuing his studies. No official eason has been given for his expulsion from Isfahan, but it is thought that it k was because he unwittingly frequented Julfa (the Armenian quarter of Isfahan) and was actually training a racehorse belonging to an Armenian for the local races. The only race track is quite close to the local barracks, and the only other competitors are officers of the garrison. 9. German Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 (current), paragraph 6 (iv). Colonel Hans Rohde, the German military and air attache, has returned from Kabul, where he secured certain orders for artillery for the Afghan army. He has now left Tehran for Berlin. 10. Floods. On the 12 th September a cloudburst and floods caused the complete destruc tion of the town of Nahavend (million sheet No. 9, square A 2 ). It is reported in the press that over 200 persons were drowned. Severe rains and consequent flooding is also reported from Azerbaijan, Dizful and other parts of Iran. Snow has fallen on the higher mountains. 11. Refugees. A press report states that a further 600 Iranian deportees have arrived from the U.S.S.R. H. J.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and, with reference to Tehran despatch No. 320 of the 24th September, 1938, has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 21 for the period ending the 8 th October, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, October 8 , 1938. (Secret.) Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 21 for the Period ending October 8 , 1938. 1. The Shah. ON the 26th September His Imperial Majesty the Shah visited the oflicers’ school at Tehran for the “ passing out ” ceremony of the senior term cadets. His Majesty was received by the supervising General Officer, Sar Lashgar (General) Yazdan Panah (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 222), General Officer Com manding, 1st Division. Before presenting the cadets with their commissions. His Imperial Majesty gave a short address in which was the following passage :— “ Because of its peculiar geographical position Iran must have a big and powerful army with which to safeguard the many vital interests of our country; unfortunately in the past this was sadly neglected, but thanks to our present educational system brave and courageous young Iran, now fully awakened, recognises the benefits of a powerful and disciplined army. Our army, too, is the guardian of our internal security, without which the reforms and progress achieved would have been impossible. It is, therefore, a happy augury for the future that large numbers of young men every year, like yourselves, willingly and patriotically adopt the honourable profession of a soldier, and after a course of scientific and practical study in this college fit themselves to become efficient leaders in our army.’ On the 25th September His Imperial Majesty carried out an inspection of the new School of Domestic Science for girls. Started in a small way in 1314 (1934), this establishment has now accommodation for 200 boarders. The course in domestic science lasts three years, and includes instruction in household manage ment, cookery, bakery, dressmaking, hospital nursing, hygiene and child welfare Several other schools of the same sort are to be constructed in other large towns. It was remarked that His Imperial Majesty was unaccompanied by any of the Royal ladies, who have not appeared in public for some time. 2. The Crown Prince. His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince has successfully qualified at the officers’ school. He was one of the officer cadets to be presented with their com missions (2nd and 3rd lieutenants) at the “passing out’’ ceremony by His Imperial Majesty the Shah. At the request of the army and bis fellow cadets, the Crown Prince was awarded a special medal of merit for his diligence and hard work in the officers’ school. Long eulogistic articles have been published about his hard work and devotion to duty, &amp;c., in the press. [439 aa—1]Among the cadets to pass out was Ali Muhammad, the son of his Excellency Ibrahim Qawam (Qawam-ul-Mulk) (Foreign Office Personalities, No. 160, Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 171), who married Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, the Crown Prince’s sister, in March 1937. 3. Iranian Officials. (i) M. Abbas Faroughi has been appointed Director of the Protocol Depart ment at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (ii) Sartip (Brigadier) Mehdi Quli Tajbakhsh (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 214) has been appointed Acting Minister of Agriculture. 4. British Interests. (i) Mrs. Seymour, wife of His Majesty’s Minister, arrived in Tehran on the 2nd October from England. (ii) Major H. W. Farrell, Indian Medical Service, legation surgeon, Kabul, accompanied by wife, arrived in Tehran on the 4th October. He is in transit from Kabul to Europe.

(ii) The munition factory at Saltanatabad, situated about 7 miles north of Tehran (degree sheet 9 M, square B 1), has been completed. All the machinery (which includes a modern electric foundry) for the manufacture of various types of grenades and shells has been supplied by Messrs. Krupp of Germany. The factory, which is under expert German supervision, is expected to start work within a few days. 6 . The Iranian Air Force. During a firework display in Tehran on the 24th September (anniversary of the Prophet Mahomet) an aeroplane of the Iranian air force, brilliantly illuminated with the country’s national colours, flew over the city. It is believed to be the first time that the Iranian air force have attempted night flying. 7. Education. Considerable and praiseworthy progress is being made in public instruction for girls and illiterates. Night classes have now begun for the winter session, and the press has been urging all who can to attend. They point out that people, such as waiters, bath attendants and shop assistants, must attend these classes, as, if they do not do so, the municipalities intend to withhold their trade licences. An appeal is also being thrown on the screen in all the principal cinemas in the capital. 8 . Communications. Branch Lines. —(i) Qishlaq (Garmsar)-Semnan-Meshed. —The survey of this line has been carried out as far as Shahrud (million sheet No. 15, square D 4). (ii) Tehram-Tabriz-Turkish Frontier. —The Ministry of Roads and Com munications is still engaged in discussions with Consortium Kampsax. It is, however, expected that the construction of Lot 1, Tehran-Kerej, will begin this month.

This service will, it is said, start from Stockholm, flying via Moscow, Kharkov, Baku and Tehran. 11. The Crisis. It is reported from a reliable source that two squadrons of No. 1 Aviation Regiment were ordered to be prepared to proceed to the oil-fields area in the event of hostilities breaking out.

Tehran, October 22, 1938. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 22 for the Period ending October 22. 1938. 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Royal family continue to be in residence at the Imperial Palace. On Friday, the 14th October, His Majesty attended the second day of the autumn races held under the auspices of the Jockey Club of Iran at Jalalieh race course. It may be remarked that except for two short visits to his estates in Mazanderan and Gilan His Majesty has remained in the capital throughout the year. This is unusual, as he has hitherto carried out prolonged tours of inspection in the provinces during the spring and autumn. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 (current), paragraph 2 . His Excellency Muzaffar A’lam. Minister for Foreign Affairs (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 10 —Foreign Office Personalities. No. 2), arrived in Tehran from Geneva on the 14th October. (ii) M. Suleiman Kalhar has been appointed Farmandar (Governor) of Tabriz and Acting Ustandar (Governor-General) of No. Ill Ustan and not as stated in paragraph 3 of Intelligence Summary No. 20 (current). 3. British Interests. Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Underwood, British Military Attache, was on tour in Azerbaijan from the 12th to 17th October. 4. French Interests. General de Division G. Gendre (retired list), until recently head of the French Military Mission, and Adviser in Defence to the Iranian Ministry of War, has . left Tehran on completion of contract. He held the rank of sipahbud (marshal) in the Iranian army. General Gendre was very popular with both foreigners and Iranians. Mme. Gendre died suddenly in Tehran a few T days before their departure. The body has been embalmed and conveyed to France for interment. 5. U.S.S.R. Interests. His Excellency Alexei Tchernikh, the U.S.S.R. Ambassador to Iran since the 21st May, 1935, has proceeded on leave to Moscow. [464 g—2] B6 . United States Interests. Mr. Wallace Murray, head of the Near East Bureau of the State Department at Washington, recently visited Iran during a tour of the Near East countries. He was Charge d’Affaires in Tehran from 1922-25 and held office at the time Mr. Imrie, American Vice-Consul, was murdered by a fanatical mob. Mr. Murj^i^ was mainly instrumental in obtaining an apology and a large sum for comp^^^ sation from the Iranian Government. During his stay in Tehran Mr. Murray was granted an audience by His Majesty the Shah and took the opportunity to deliver a personal message of greetings from President Roosevelt to the Shah. Before leaving Iran Mr. Murray gave an interview to Iranian press repre sentatives and through them congratulated Iran on the recent progress achieved. He also paid a tribute to the great work of the Shah and referred to the cordial relations now existing between the United States and Iran. It may be recalled, however, that Iran has had no diplomatic representative at Washington since the withdrawal of the Iranian Minister in November 1935, who was arrested on a charge of exceeding the speed limit. It is considered now possible that the Shah will in the near future reappoint a representative in the United States. 7. Iranian A ir Force. (i) Construction work on the aerodrome at Tabriz is in progress. Two large hangars have been completed and two others await roofing material. Barracks and office buildings have been erected behind the hangars to accommodate the air force personnel. (ii) It is reported that the airport at Bushire is being considerably enlarged. Two square kilometres of land is now being levelled. (iii) The first consignment of Hawker “ Hind ” machines (eighteen) for the Iranian air force were despatched by sea from England on the 23rd September. The remaining seventeen will be despatched by the next available steamer towards the end of this month. They are to be assembled in Ahwaz and flown to Tehran. 8 . The Iranian A rmy. (i) New barracks are being constructed for the 4th Eastern (Azerbaijan) Division on the southern outskirts of the town. They should be completed within the next two months. (ii) A consular report states that one anti-aircraft battery of four guns is now located at Tabriz and one at Rezaieh. (iii) Two battalions of the 3rd (Bahadur) Infantry Regiment of the Central Garrison are now on frontier duty between Maku and Julfa. Apparentlv these units were despatched from Tehran to the frontier some months ago. 9. European crisis. The European crisis has been followed with intense interest in Tehran almost as much by the Iranians as by the large foreign community. Apart from Russians, Germans and Czechs comprise by far the largest proportion of the foreign community. The Czechs, among whom are a number of Sudeten Germans, are mostly employed by Skodas, who hold contracts for the erection of electrical power houses, sugar refineries and armament factories, &amp;c. 10 . The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. A consular report states that during the recent world crisis four Hansa Line steamers, under orders from Germany, took refuge at Bandar Shahpur, a neutral port, and there to await further instructions. A fifth steamer was also voyaging in the Persian Gulf at the time. 11. Education. At the invitation of the University of London, the Tehran educational authorities have selected the following graduates to undergo a course of post graduate study at the university : Mohammed Ali Daneshwar, Mehdi Farough.3 12. Buildings. (i) The Majlis has voted a credit of 7 million rials (£87,500) for the con struction of a new Ministry for Foreign Affairs building. (ii) The engineers of Consortium Kampsax have completed the grain silo at Tabriz. This silo has a capacity of 16,000 tons. Work is progressing on the silo which is being erected at Meshed which is of the same capacity. 13. Refugees. Iranian deportees continue to arrive from the U.S.S.R. During the period under review over 400 arrived at Bandar Pahlavi. Julfa and Bajgiran (million sheet No. 22, square C 3). This brings the total number of refugees deported from Russia to approximately 22,000. 14. Routes: Northern (Iran-Afghanistan—Herat-Kabul). The route, Herat (million sheet No. 29, square C 2 )-Kala Nao-Bala Murghab (million sheet No. 29, square D 1 )-Maimana (million sheet No. 33, square A 1 )-Andkhui (million sheet No. 32, square B 4 )—Mazar-i-Sharif (million sheet No. 32. square D 4), is reliably reported as difficult and almost impassable for light cars. Travellers are advised to use the Hera t-Farah-Kandahar—Kabul road. 15. Change in Place Names. A list of places in Iran, the names of which have been recently changed, is given as Appendix A to this summary. 16. Civil Aviation. The winter schedule (the 1 st October, 1938. to the 31st March. 1939) of the Deutsche Lufthansa passenger air service is given as Appendix B to this summary. 17. Royal Indian Navy. His Majesty’s Indian ships CHve, Indus, Hindustan and Lawrence cruised in the Persian Gulf during August. The following ports were visited : Muscat, Khor Fakhan, Khor Tirana. Khor Kuwait and Bahrein. 18. Railways. The Ministry of Industry and Mines has recently called for tenders for the (a) A rope railway between the coal mines of Shimshak (degree sheet 8 P, square C 4) and Fashand (degree sheet 9 M, square C 1). /ov u a k^i i (b) A Decauville railway between Fashand and hhahr Rey (Shah Abdul Azim) (degree sheet 9 M, square B 2) and Tehran. 19.

Tehran, October 21, 1938. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 23 for the Period ending November 5, 1938. 1. The Shah. (i) ON Wednesday, the 26th October, the anniversary of the Crown Prince’s birthday, His Imperial Majesty the Shah took the unprecedented step of enter* taining to dinner at the Imperial Palace the x\mbassadors and Ministers of the foreign missions now in Tehran, together with their wives. After the banquet the Charge d’Affaires, leading Cabinet Ministers and generals, and the families of heads of missions were invited to join the party for the evening. The Royal circle, which included Her Majesty the Queen, the Crown Prince, Princess Shahdukht Shams-ul-Mulk Pahlevi, her husband Feridun Jam, Princess Ashraf-ul-Mulk Pahlevi and her husband Ali Qawam, received their guests in the Grand Salon. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were in attendance and presented the guests. His Majesty is reported on all sides to have been “ the life and soul of the party,” personally offering his guests cigarettes and so forth, and taking a delight in showing them the various objets d'art in the rooms. At dinner the seating arrangements were unusual. The Shah seated himself at a long table with the Princesses on his right and left. The Queen was supported by the Crown Prince and her eldest son-in-law. The guests were seated in order of precedence of arrival in Iran. The Queen, whom very few of the guests had ever seen before, remained tongue-tied and very shy throughout the evening. The Crown Prince and the Princesses were also somewhat embarrassed. Considering, however, the language difficulty, and that this is the first time that such a function has ever taken place, it is generally agreed that the reception was most successful, and that the Shah proved himself an admirable host and enjoyed himself thoroughly. During the evening the Shah expressed the wish that the Princesses might see more of the younger set of the Diplomatic Corps. In spite of this it is not, however, expected that social relations between the palace and foreign missions, at present non-existent, will be encouraged until after the arrival of Her Royal Highness the Princess Fowzieh of Egypt (the future Crown Princess). The severe restrictions on social intercourse between Iranians and foreigners are, however, not likely to be modified. (ii) His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, left Tehran by train on the 31st October to attend the annual Turcoman Race Meeting at Dashte Gurgan, close to Bandar Shah. The whole of the Cabinet and most of the Majlis Deputies are already in Bandar Shah. [464 1—1]3 A consular report from Khuzistan states that there is a general regulation throughout Iran whereby no more than 10 per cent. Jews and 10 per cent. Armenians may be employed in any one concern. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are stated to have more than its quota of each, and that the contracts of Jews and Armenians in excess of the quota will in future not be renewed in order that there may be the desired 80 per cent, of true Iranian employees. This is likely to cause considerable embarrassment to the company as Iranians do not like service in South Iran. 10 . Communications. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), paragraph 5 . It is confirmed that the Iranian Government have awarded Consortium Kampsax the contract for the construction of 2,500 kilom. of branch lines in Iran. The price agreed on is said to be 5 gold dollars per metre. 11. Internal Security. Fifty-three Iranian subjects are now being tried before the Central Criminal Court at Tehran for alleged sedition and the spreading of Communist propaganda in Iran. Among the accused are several well-known professional men. 12 . The Press. The press have recently contained much propaganda in favour of a Bill now before the Majlis requiring that a certificate of freedom from contagious disease must be produced by both parties before any State official can perform a marriage. “ Iran needed a larger population, but the increased population had to be healthy. The Government had already taken steps in this direction, such as the encouragement of boy scouts and girl guides and the development of physical training. The new Bill would ensure that the next generation would he more healthy; further, the law would have a beneficial effect on the behaviour of the young, since the knowledge that they would have to pass a medical examination before being permitted to marry would deter them from incontinence and lascivious desires.” It is considered that the press is far too optimistic in its ideas about the effect of this Bill on the youth of Iran. Doctors are, however, reported to be much in favour of the Bill. Tehran, November 5, 1938. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 7447/167/34] Copy No. i|3 Mr. Seymour to Viscount Halifax.—{Received December 12.) (No. 369. Secret.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 24 for the period ending the 19th November, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, November 22 , 1938. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 24 for the period ending November 19, 1938. 1 . The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, after attending the Annual Turkoman Race Meeting on the 31st October at Dasht Gurgan, has been carrying out a detailed and thorough inspection of factories, schools, harbours and other public works in the Provinces of Mazanderan and Gilan. Among the towns visited were Sari, Babul, Babul Sar, Rasht and Bandar Pahlavi. The Royal party are still on tour. 2 . The Royal Engagement. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), paragraph 2. As generally expected, a special law was introduced in the Majlis and unanimously passed supplementing article 37 of the Constitutional Law of the Empire. This law reads as follows :— “ The eldest son, if born of a Iranian mother, shall be heir apparent to the Throne. In the event of the Shah having no son, the heir to the Throne shall be designated by His Imperial Majesty subject to the approval of the Majlis. No member of the Qajar family can, however, be so designated.” The Minister of Justice, introducing the new law, spoke of the Constitutional * Law being a set of principles couched in general terms. He went on to say that the intention of the Constitutional Law was that the mother of the future heir apparent should have acquired her title to be an Iranian, not by the mere fact of her marriage with the ruler but by one of the ‘ ‘ essential ’ ’ (being born of an Iranian father or born on Iranian soil) or “ accessory ” (by marriage) means envisaged by the Civil Code. In the case, however, of the future Queen (Princess Fowzieh of Egypt) it was not considered sufficient that she should acquire Iranian nationality in one of the ways open to everybody under the Civil Code and for this reason provision for an Imperial decree, subject to the approval of the Majlis, had now been included in the Constitutional Law. 3. Death of the Turkish President. The news of the death of Ataturk had not been unexpected, as his recent severe attacks of illness had been fully reported. The Iranian press devote long articles in praise of the late President, describing in detail his life, works and genius.2 At a special meeting of the Majlis held on the afternoon of the 17th November the President of the Assembly, in moving the adjournment of the house in honour of the deceased, delivered a moving oration describing the death of Ataturk as a great calamity not only for the Turkish people but also for Iran and the Iranians. The Assembly, all standing, observed a two-minute silence and then adjourned. The diplomatic and public galleries were crowded. I Following the news of the late President’s death, His Imperial Majesty the Shah has ordered Court and official mourning for a period of one month, and has also despatched a delegation to attend the funeral ceremonies at Angora. The Iranian delegation is as follows : — His Excellency Khalil Fahimi (Foreign Office Personalities, No. 76), Iranian Ambassador to Turkey nominated as Envoy Extraordinary to the funeral. His Excellency Sar Lashgar (Major-General) Ahmed Nakhchevan (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 193, Foreign Office Personalities, No. 139), Acting Minister of War. Sartip (Brigadier) Kupal (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 155, Foreign Office Personalities, No. 114). Sarhang (Colonel) Arfa (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 37, Foreign Office Personalities, No. 30). A detachment of three officers and fifty-two other ranks of the Pahlavi Guard Regiment, with colour party. It may be recalled that Kemal Ataturk was the host of His Imperial Majesty the Shah when the latter paid a State visit to Turkey in the summer of 1934. The only foreign visit that the Shah has as yet undertaken. From that date the friendship between the two rulers ripened. It is without doubt largely due to Ataturk s fearless example that the Shah has been emboldened to carry out the reforms now in vogue in Iran, especially that of the emancipation of women. 4. Internal Security. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 11 . The trial of the fifty-three persons for alleged participation in a Communist conspiracy has at last been concluded. All the accused have been found guilty. Nine of the principal accused have been sentenced to ten years’ solitary confinement and the remainder to sentences varying from four to seven years’ solitary confine ment. It is generally considered that the sentences are extremely harsh, as the organisation was little more than a students’ debating society formed by students and professional men who had studied abroad. For the first two days of the trial the Central Criminal Courts were open to the public, but after an unexpected outburst and protest from two of the accused the later sittings were held in camera. Carefully edited reports were handed to the press for publication. These contained only detailed evidence for the prosecu tion and nothing of the defence. (ii) At Isfahan in September and early October a large number of Armenians and others were arrested for interrogation by the secret police. Twelve Julfa Armenians were subsequently detained in custody for further investigation. It is now reported that most of these have now been released, as nothing could be proved against them. 5. British Interests. Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Underwood, British Military Attache, visited Habbaniya and Bagdad from the 8 th to 15th November. 6 . German Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 7, lines 2 and 3. For (“ £25 million ”) read (“ £2^ million ”). 7. European Crisis. It is learned from a reliable source that the German Legation in Tehran, together with the local Nazi organisation, summoned a number of their countrymen and issued instructions on how they were to act in Tehran in the event of war3 4 breaking out. Similar action had also been taken in all important towns in the provinces. There are now approximately 3,000 Germans in Iran, and this number is steadily increasing. ^ 8 . The Trans-Iranian Railway. Fifteen new locomotives and an unspecified number of passenger and goods waggons, all of German manufacture, have arrived at Ahwaz. There they are being assembled under the supervision of expert German railway engineers. 9. Iranian Air Force. On the 13th November a Hawker “ Audax ’' aeroplane belonging to No. 1 Air Regiment crashed from a considerable height in the mountains north of Tehran. The pilot Satwan yekum (First Lieutenant) Nasirullah Nasir and his n.c.o. observer were instantaneously killed. The machine itself was completely wrecked. 10 . Changes in Place Names. The name Siyah Dahan (degree sheet 8 H, square C 4) has been changed to Takistan. This village belongs to His Imperial Majesty the Shah. 11 . The A ?iglo-Iranian Oil Company. It is reliably reported from several sources that the new oil pipe-line from Gach Saran to Abadan (million sheet No. 10 , square A '2) is already under construction. The pipe-line runs from Gach Saran straight across the marshes north of Khor Musa (million sheet No. 10, square A '!). As Gach Saran is situated at a height, the oil will travel by gravity without the need of pumping stations. Pipes, &amp;c., are now being landed at Khor Kazaleh, one of the creeks of the Khor Musa, where a new jetty has been built. No decision has as yet been taken on the proposed site of the new refinery in the Khor Musa. The experts’ report is now being considered in London. 12. Iranian Baluchistan. A consular report states that on the 15th November a mixed column consisting of 3,000 troops of the Zahidan and Zabul garrisons left for Nasratabad Sipi (million sheet No. 24, square D 3) and have surrounded Juma Khan Ismailzai and his followers. Action by the military authorities has long been expected, as this Baluchi Sirdar has been responsible for most of the trouble and unrest in Iranian Mekran. It now remains to be seen whether Juma Khan will successfully evade the net spread for him. 13. Iranian Army. It is reported, but as yet unconfirmed, that the Amnieh (Road Guards) Officers’ Training College in Tehran has been abolished. 14. Military Publications. Issues No. 7, 8 , 9 and 10 of Volume II of the Piyada Nizam (Infantry Journal) contain nothing of interest to the General Staff. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Military Attache.'EGRET.

Tehran, December 16, 1938. (Secret.) Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 25 for the Period ending December 3, 1938. 1 . The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, have returned to the capital and are in residence at the Imperial Palace. 2. The Royal Engagement. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 27 (current), paragraph 2. The law introduced in the Majlis whereby provision is made for an Imperial decree granting Iranian nationality to Her Royal Highness Princess lowzieh on her marriage with the Crown Prince, has passed its final reading and has become law. Court officials and others are busily engaged in arranging appropriate ceremonial for the wedding in Tehran. According to the latest reports, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, accompanied by his sisters and brothers-in-law will proceed to Egypt via Bagdad and Syria after Non Ruz (New Year's Day), the 21st March. He and his bride will return by sea to either Bandar Shahpur or Khurramshahr, and will travel to the capital in the Royal train. Between 2,000 and 3,000 guests and visitors are expected in Tehran for the wedding. To find suitable accommodation for such a large number is one of the many problems now confronting the authorities. 3. Iranian Officials. His Excellency Abdul Majid Ahi (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 7; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 9) was dismissed from office by order of His Imperial Majesty the Shah on the 29th November. Rajab Ali Mansur, C.B.E. (Mansul-ul-Mulk) (Military Attache’s Personali ties, No. 164; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 122), the present Minister of Industry and Mines, is likely to succeed him. In the meantime Dr. Sadjadi, First Under-Secretary, is acting as Minister. 4. British Interests. ( 1 ) H.M.S. Norfolk, flying the flag of his Excellency Vice-Admiral J. F. Somerville, C.B., D.S.O., Commander-in-chief, East Indies, cruised in the Persian Gulf from the 19th November to the 3rd December. The following places were visited :—- Khor Kuwai. Abadan. Trucial Coast. Koweit. Bahrein. Muscat. [489 ff—1] BMUZ* mmm — — 2 At Abadan the usual official exchange of calls was carried out. The Iranian sloops based on the Persian Gulf were on prolonged manoeuvres at the time of the visit. (2) On the 2nd December His Majesty’s Minister was granted an audience by His Imperial Majesty the Shah, and on behalf of His Majesty King George VI presented a silver and enamel casket as a return gift for the carpet which the Shah had sent to His Majesty on the occasion of his Coronation. The Shah accepted the gift with keen pleasure. 5. French Interests. The French military mission is now reduced to four members. They are as under :— Colonel Henriet. Lieutenant-Colonel Pachaud Chalret du Rieu. Major Massonee. Major Vicomte de la Moussaye. The two last named complete their contracts in January 1939. The Iranian Ministry of War have not yet asked for the replacement of the military mission. This is causing some uneasiness in French circles, as it is known that both the German and Italian Governments are endeavouring to sell war material and aircraft to the Iranian Government together with an offer of experts and instructors. It is also stated that both Sar Lashgar (Major-General) Yazdan Panah, Commandant of the Military Academy and the Staff College, and his Chief of Staff, Sarhang (Colonel) Arfa (Military Attache's Personalities, No. 37; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 30), are reported to be strongly pro-German. Since the commencement of the new session in October both colleges have been studying German military text-books in preference to the French. 6. The Iranian Army. (1) During October Colonel Henriet, chief of the French Military Mission and Adviser in Defence, visited the Persian Gulf ports together with a party of students from the Staff College. The party visited Bandar Abbas, Lingeh and Bushire. A similar tour was carried out last year, and it may be assumed that the problem of the defence of these ports was again studied. (2) It is reliably reported that a company of Alpine troops, equipped with skis, is about to be formed in the Iranian army. A Swedish or Swiss officer instructor may be engaged. There are excellent training slopes close to Tehran. (3) On the evening of the 29th November a fire broke out in the old arsenal in the centre of the city, now used as an ordnance workshop. The damage is stated to be in the neighbourhood of 160,000 rials (£20,000). Specially seasoned wood for rifle stocks, &amp;c., and expensive machinery was totally destroyed. His Imperial Majesty the Shah himself visited the scene of the fire, and on the following day inspected the powder factory at Parchin and the central supply depot, where he made careful enquiries as to the precautions taken against fire in these establishments. The Ministry of War, acting on the Shah’s instructions, have given a contract to a French firm for the immediate reconstruction and re-equipping of the destroyed ordnance workshop. (4) The following quantities of explosives for the new Stokes Brandt 81 mm. mortars have been delivered :— 7,500 shells. 7,600 cartridges. 7,600 fuzes. 45.600 exploders. (5) Owing to the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, the Ministry of War have been anxious about the delivery of the remainder of the order for 200,000 Brno rifles. Czechoslovakian armament firms have, however, reassured the Ministry that all outstanding contracts can easily be fulfilled. As a result an order for a further 250,000 rifles is reliably stated to have been placed, and ateven cheaper cost. Representatives of Belgian armament firms who visited Tehran just after the crisis in the hope of taking over Czech contracts have met with no success. (6) Optical instruments have recently been purchased from the Societe fran^aise d’Optique et de Mecanique (S.O.M.) for a sum of million francs as under :— 8 stereoscopic rangefinders (base 3 metres). 41 rangefinders (base 2 metres). 1 rangefinder (base 70 cm.). 160 panorama sights. 50 battery telescopes (double binocular). 150 altitude measuring sights. 7. The Iranian Air Force. (1) It is reliably reported that the two Iranian test pilots now in England have recent visited Italy. The Italians are prepared to supply twin-engine bombing aircraft for delivery within six weeks complete with equipment, guns, wireless, &amp;c. Payment to be 50 per cent, in sterling or dollars and the balance in Iranian goods. Facilities will also be given in Italy for the training of pilots and mechanics. (2) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 (current), paragraph 7 (3). The first consignment of eighteen Hawker “ Hind ” aircraft has arrived at Ahwaz and are being assembled in batches of five. After undergoing the usual test formalities the machines will be handed over to the Iranian air force and flown to Tehran. 8. Aerodromes. A landing ground has been constructed at Dilijan (million sheet No. 9, square C 2). 9. Italian Interests. Capitano di Fregata Luciano Bigi, Italian naval and air attache, left Tehran for Italy on completion of his tenure of appointment. His successor is Capitano di Corvetta Luigi Mola. 10. Internal Security. (1) A number of burglaries culminating in the brutal murder of a German- born Jew, agricultural expert (nationalised Iranian) have occurred in the centre of Tehran. The police have shown commendable speed in rounding up the murderers. The majority of those arrested are deportees from the Soviet Union recently arrived in Iran. (2) The number of beggars in the streets of Tehran have greatly increased, these, too, are largely deportees. 11. The Iranian Navy. An unconfirmed report states that Naokhuda (Captain) Bayendor and his brother, who is also a naval officer, will leave shortly for Italy in connexion with proposals for the acquisition of additional fleet units. 12. The Funeral of the late Turkish President. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 3. The Iranian delegation to the funeral of Ataturk have returned to Tehran. The party travelled via Khaniqin, Kirkuk, Tel-Kotchek to Angora and returned by the same route. . . As already stated, considerable prominence was given in the press to Ataturk’s career. These articles emphasised the close paiallel between Iran and Turkey. There was, however, an undercurrent of apprehension at the thought of what might happen if the new Iran, like the new 1 urkey, were suddenly to find itself without its present ruler. [489 ff—1] B 24 13. Iranian Baluchistan. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 24 (current), paragraph 12. As anticipated, Juma Khan and about thirty of his followers successfully evaded arrest and crossed into the Chagai Agency at Piran (million sheet No. 30, square B 3). . Intelligence Bureau, Qetta, reports that five motor buses carrying wounded infantry have arrived in Zahidan. The Ismailzai casualties are estimated a* forty killed and wounded. This is still unconfirmed. 14. Factories. A large new spinning factory has been erected in Qum. 15. Egyptian Interests. His Excellency E. P. Latif Tala’at Bey the new Minister for Egypt was received in audience by His Imperial Majesty the Shah at the Gulistan Palace on the 26th November, and presented his letters of credence. 16. Currency. The National Bank (Bank i Mellie) publish a final notice calling in the following coinage : — (1) 1 and 2 dinars in copper. (2) 50 and 100 dinars in nickel (1 and 2 shahis). (3) 5, 10 and 25 dinars in nickel. (4) 5, 10 and 25 dinars in copper. The new coinage issue is in bronze, and consists of : — (1) 5 dinar coin. (2) 10 dinar coin. (3) 50 dinar coin. 17. The Caspian Sea. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 11 (current), paragraph 16. Both the Soviet Union and Iran are concerned over the rate at which the Caspian Sea is receding. So far no effective solution of the problem has been found. It is reported in the press that Soviet engineers are seriously considering a project for changing the northern watershed, so that the streams which flow across the steppes of Northern Russia into the Arctic Ocean would become tributaries of the Volga and Ural Rivers, and thereby increase the flow of water into the Caspian. 18. The Iranian Cabinet. Members of the Iranian Cabinet on the 1st December, 1938, are given as an appendix. 19. Cinema Films. Within recent months a number of Indian films (viz., “ The Tiger of Bengal ” and “ The Hindu’s Tomb ”) have been shown in Iran. These films are most popular with the public. The sound recording of these films is, however, either in Hindustani or in French. If it were possible to arrange for the recording to be in Persian their success would be enormous, and a firm hold could be established in the film market. H. J.

December 29. 1938. Section 2. [E 7836/167 341 Copy No Mr. Seymour to Viscount Halifax.—(Received December 29.) (No. 402. Secret.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the period ending the 17th December, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, December 17, 1938. (Secret.) Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the Period ending December 17, 1938. 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Royal Family continue to be in residence at the Imperial Palace. Recently certain newspapers in London, Paris and Tokyo reported that Herr Hitler had invited His Imperial Majesty the Shah to visit Germany in the spring of 1939 and that the invitation had been accepted. An official dementi has been published in the Iranian press. 2. Iranian Officials. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 3. No new Minister of Roads and Communications has yet been appointed. The affairs of the Ministry are reliably reported to be in a chaotic state and will require complete reorganisation. M. Ahi, the late Minister, is now under close arrest pending the result of an enquiry into the loss of large sums which ought to have been expended on the country’s road system. 3. British Interests. (1) Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Underwood, British Military Attache, toured in Isfahan and Shiraz districts from the 7th to the 13th December. (2) Lieutenant P. G. B. McNalty, 2nd Royal Lancers, who is undergoing one year’s language study duty in Iran, was transferred from Kerman to Shiraz at his own request on the 3rd December. 4. The Iranian Army. (1) It is reliably reported that infantry regiments of the Tehran garrison are now in possession of anti-tank guns of Skoda manufacture. These are apparently organised as an anti-tank platoon of four guns per regiment. The Turkish Military Attache, during a recent visit to the barracks of the 3rd (Bahadur) Regiment, observed practice in gun-laying and mechanism being carried out with this type of gun. (2) An unconfirmed report states that both the Isfahan and Kermanshah Independent Brigades will shortly be raised to divisions. This may be correct, as Isfahan is the headquarters of the 10th Recruiting District and is the only recruiting district in which a complete division does not exist. An unusual number of new barracks are under construction in both these towns. [489 ft—2]2 5. Fortifications. An unconfirmed but reliable report states that coast defence artillery (Skodas) has been installed on Ashurdeh Island and at several places near Bandar Shah (million sheet No. 15, square B 4). Concrete machine-gun posts and sites for guns have also been constructed on the Chains road (million sheet^^. No. 8), as well as on the main Bandar Pahlavi-Resht-Tehran road. 6. Petrol. Petrol is now being sold in bulk at modern filling stations with pumps erected by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in all towns and at various points along the main roads. The price is 1-33 rials per litre, which works out at about 1$. f$d. per gallon. A new bulk depot is being constructed at Azna (million sheet No. 9, square B 3), on the Trans-Iranian Railway, of five 1 million gallon tanks. When completed next year, Azna will become the distributing depot for the Isfahan and Kerman area. The road between Azna and Isfahan is under reconstruction. 7. Iranian Baluchistan. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 13. The Iranian Government have formally demanded the extradition of Juma Khan Ismailzai, his son Jalal and several of his accomplices. This request had to be refused as no extradition treaty between the Iranian Government and the Government of India exists. Juma Khan Ismailzai and his followers, who include a large number of women and children, are reported to have been disarmed and sent to Nuskhi under arrest. 8. Internal Security. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 10. On the 7th December thirteen criminals, including the murderers of a German-born Jew resident in Tehran, were executed by shooting at the central gaol. 9. Communications. (1) Railways: Tehram-Tahriz Line. —The construction of 42 kilom. between Tehran and Kerej has commenced. Two hundred and fifty small bridges will be constructed, including one over the Kerej River of about 180 metres in length. This lot will be completed by November 1939. (2) Messrs. Consortium Kampsax have not succeeded in arranging the terms of their new contract for further railway construction (vide Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 10), which were on the point of completion when the late Minister of Roads and Communications was dismissed. Fresh negotiations have had to be undertaken. It is not expected that any further construction beyond that of Lot 1 (Tehran-Kerej) will be commenced until the spring of 1939. (3) Representatives of Messrs. Lindsay, Parkinson and Co., railway constructional engineers, who have been in Tehran recently with a view to negotiating a contract with the Iranian Government, have now returned to London. 10. Climatic Conditions. Heavy snow and rain has fallen throughout Iran during the past ten days. This is much earlier than usual. 11. Postal Agreement. A postal agreement has been signed at Kabul between representatives of Afghanistan and Iran. This agreement establishes a direct and regular service of mails between the two countries. Transfer of mails will take place between the undermentioned post offices :— Iran. A fghanistan. Kariz Islam Kala (Million sheet No. 29, square A 2) Zabul Nad-i-Ali (Million sheet No. 30, square B 1)3 12. The A nglo-Iranian Oil Company. , ^ nder the terms of the Cadman Agreement of 1933 the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have to demarcate and notify the Iranian Government before the 31st December, 1938, of the exact areas over which they wish to operate the concession of 100,000 square miles of Iranian territory granted to the company. During the last two years thorough surveys have been carried out by the company s geologists in the Provinces of Luristan and Pars, and also of the coast line up to the 3-mile limit between the Shatt-el-Arab and Gwadar. The experts, in making their reports, have pointed out the probability of their being five or six large oil-fields lying somewhere in the region comprised by the flat country at the head of the Persian Gulf and the adjacent sea. It is quite possible that during the next ten years the company may wish to start operations in parts of the sea bed as far distant as 12 miles from the Iranian coast, as it is now technically possible to tap the fields under the sea through even greater depths of water than at present, although nowhere is the depth likely to be more than 5 fathoms. Such oil-fields already exist along the Californian coast line of America. 1 his brings up a number of complicated points, one of which is the limit of territorial waters normally 3 miles, whereas the Iranian Government claim a 12-mile limit. Another is the acquisition by effective occupation of a claim beyond the 3-mile limit by means of the erection of artificial construction. 1 he company’s representatives are now in Tehran discussing this problem with the Ministry of Finance and have expressed their desire to include in their concession the whole Iranian coast line. 13. Roads. The main road between Tehran and Qum, which has deteriorated greatly since the construction of the Trans-Iranian Railway, is to be completelv remetalled and the bridges strengthened in order to cope with the increasing motor traffic between the capital and such centres as Isfahan, Shiraz and South-East Iran. 14. British Cemetery. The British cemetery at Task Point is reported to be in a very neglected) state. Many of the gravestones and wooden crosses have been thrown down. This cemetery contains over forty graves, including those of naval ratings and others who took part in the original surveys and actions in the Persian Gulf over a century ago. 15. The Press. The Iranian press continue to publish laudatory articles on Egypt. Current news on Egyptian affairs is also featured daily in the Journal cle Teheran. For some time past the foreign press have escaped attack; however, this unusual state of affairs has not lasted long, and English, French, German and Russian newspapers have all been found wanting. It must be the first time on record that the Berliner Tagehlatt, Le Concours medical frangais, Men Only and Women, Boys and Men of Old Lands have found themselves bracketed together! H. J.

Tehran, December 31, 1938. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 27 for the Period ending December 31, 1938. 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Royal family continue to be in residence at the Imperial Palace. His Majesty is reported to be as indefatigable as ever. Among his recent engagements were the opening of an Orphans Home in the city, inspection of municipal improvement schemes and surprise visits to army units. His Majesty has also been closely studying the foreign exchange position and the proposed renewal of the German Trade Agreement. 2. The Crown Prince. The first part of the official programme has now been fixed for His Highness the Crown Prince’s wedding celebrations. His Royal Highness will leave Tehran on the morning of the 24th February, 1939, and will be accompanied by the following suite :— His Excellency Hassan Isfandiari (Haji Muhtashim-us-Saltaneh), president of the Majlis. His Excellency Dr. Matin-Daftari, Minister of Justice. His Excellency Dr. Moadeb Naficy, styled “ Grand Maitre de la Maison Personnelle.” His Excellency Mohammad Ali Moghaddam, formerly Minister to the Balkan States. M. le Dr. Qasmin Ghani, Member of the Majlis. M. Abbas Massoudi, Member of the Majlis and editor of the Ittalaat and Journal de Teheran. M. le Dr. Abdullah Ferouhar. second secretary of the Iranian Legation in Cairo. M. Ali Izadi, Comptroller of H.R.H. household. Sarhang (Colonel) Motezedi, A.D.C. Satwan (Captain) Qadimi, A.D.C. Satwan (Captain) Isfandiari, A.D.C. His Royal Highness Avill travel via Kazvin, Hamadan, Shahabad and Khosrovi (Irano-Iraqi frontier). On arrival at the frontier His Royal Highness will inspect a guard of honour and a salute of twenty-one guns will be fired. His Royal Highness and partv will stay in Bagdad for two days (26th and 27th February). [505 i—1] BOn the 28th February he will leave Bagdad, arriving in Damascus and Beirut on the 1st March. The Crown Prince will leave Beirut on the Egyptian royal yacht on the 2nd March, arriving in Alexandria on the 3rd March. His Royal Highness will remain in Egypt about a month, during which the Moslem marriage ceremony will take place. Their Royal Highnesses will leave Egypt by sea so as to reach Bandar Shahpur by the 14th April. Formal requests have been made to His Majesty’s Government and the French and Italian Governments for a naval escort vessel to accompany the royal yacht along their respective seaboards in the Red Sea. The British naval escort has been asked to accompany His Royal Highness from the Bab-el-Mandeb to the mouth of the Persian Gulf, after which the Imperial Iranian navy will furnish the escort. The royal party will travel by train from Bandar Shahpur to Tehran and are expected to arrive in the capital on the 16th April. 3. Iranian Officials. (i) After several changes the Shah has finally approved the appointment of M. Qasim Sur (formerly Sur-i-Israfil) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 284; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 201), late Governor of Gilan, to be officiating head of the Municipality of Tehran. (ii) M. Ghulam Reza Nurzad (Military iVttache’s Personalities, No. 204, Foreign Office Personalities, No. 148), late consul-general at Delhi, has been appointed head of the Consular Department at the Ministry for foreign Affairs. (iii) M. Abul Hassan Diba (Siqat-ud-Douleh) (Military Attache’s Personal ities, No. 77, Foreign Office Personalities No. 62) has been appointed first secretary to the Iranian Legation in Bagdad. 4. The Iranian Army. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 6 (iv). (i) A further consignment of approximately 12,400 shells for the new Stokes Brandt 81 mm. mortars has been shipped from France to Iran. (ii) Taking advantage of the still favourable weather many units of the Tehran Garrison have been seen carrying out section training in the excellent training areas immediately north of Tehran. The individual training of signallers and range-takers is also being carried out. 5. The Iranian Air Force. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 16 (current), paragraph 5 (iii), and &lt; Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 8. (i) It is reliably stated that the five Hawker “ Audax ” now under construc tion at the Shahbaz Aircraft Factory at Doshantappeh will not be ready for delivery by the end of the Iranian year (20th March, 1939). The blame for this delay will certainly be laid on the British personnel, more especially the acting technical adviser (Mr. F. Knight). (ii) The arrangements for the production of twenty Hawker “ Hind ” machines during the new Iranian year (1939-40) are still under discussion. The acting British technical adviser has drawn up a provisional programme for their construction in batches of five, seven and eight so as to maintain a continuity of work throughout the factory and forestall any lack of raw materials and engines, &amp;c., on order. The Iranian air force authorities wish, however, to construct the whole twenty machines at once, which is considered quite impossible. 6. The Imperial Bank of Iran. The British-owned and staffed Imperial Bank of Iran have throughout the year been having considerable difficulty over the question of remitting their profits and employees’ part salaries to London. Lately these troubles have come to a head and vital discussions have taken place between the general manager of the Imperial Bank in Iran and M. Bader, the Iranian Minister of Finance. The intention of the Minister is to restrict the bank’s remittances to London to the3 profits (not exceeding 10 per cent.) on sterling transactions and on sterling advances to the Iranian Government or Government institutions. The Minister of Finance is also pressing the bank to advance the Government £400.000 as the Government are short of foreign exchange resources^ A number of foreign railway construction firms have to be paid off early in 1939 and. shou the new German Clearing Agreement he approved, a lump sum payment in foreign currency of about £800.000 in part settlement of the outstanding debt may be necessary. . „ , ... ^ ,i T Discussions still continue, but it seems as if the activities of the Imperial Bank of Iran may have to be curtailed. . , ^ . T * i j It is of interest to note that the Imperial Bank of Iran was founded hity years ago. It has sixteen branches in Iran and two in Iraq. I nfortunately, within recent years the bank has had to close down several of its branches owin| to lack of business and the restrictions put upon it by the foundation ol the Banque-i-Mellie (the National Bank), a purely Iranian concern, Ac. 7. Egyptian Interests. According to a press report from Cairo, both the Egyptian Legation m Tehran and the Iranian Legation in Cairo will shortly he elevated to the status ot embassies. 8. French Interests. \ French mission, who are surveying a motor route between Paris and Saigon (Indo-China), passed through Tehran on the 22nd December. The mission was composed of the following :— M. Henri de Vilmorin, explorer and journalist. M. Roger Chancell, staff reporter of the Candide. M. Maurice Schirrer, mechanic. From Calcutta the route proposed to be followed is via Shingkmg, Yuanfu, Hanoi and Saigon. 9. The Trans-Iranian Railway. (i) Train services are now running fairly regularly between Tehran and Bandar Shahpur. The passenger tariff rates have been provisionally fixed as under :— First class : 0-40 rials per kilom. Second class : 0-25 rials per kilom. Third class : 0-15 rials per kilom. (ii) According to press reports work has commenced on Lot 1 of the Qum Yezd branch line. The contract has been given to an Iranian firm of contractors —Messrs. Kavesh. This lot is 30 kilom. long and will necessitate the construction of over 120 bridges, including one long bridge of fourteen arches each 12 metres high, over the River Ab-i-Anarbar (Qum Rud) (degree sheet Tso. 9.

Refugees. . Iranian deportees continue to arrive from the U.S.S.R. but ‘n decreasing numbers. In the course of a recent conversation His Excellency Muzaffar Aalam, Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that the number of deportees was over 35 000. The question of their disposal is under discussion. It is reliably stated that those who have no relatives (however distant) in Iran with whom they- could be billeted are to be sent well into the interior and the south. Iranian Mekran, \ezd and the mountainous country of Luristan south-east of Shiraz have all been mentioned as possible settlement areas. [505 b 24 It is also reported that among the deportees are a number of active Communist agents and a large proportion of criminals, i he recent an increasing burglaries in Tehran are all attributed to these depoi ees. 11. Public Welfare.

During the next two years the National Bank has decided to build over thirty new branches throughout* Iran, besides the construction of even a mor e elaborate and expensive head office than the present one m Tehran, which was only com- P^^The y present head office is being enlarged and contains a restaurant, club- rooms, library and swimming bath for the staff. 13.

Ah Akbar JJattari has been appointed Iranian Charge d’Aftaires at Washingtom l rns s ™ a bly due to the results of the recent visit to lehran of Mr. Wallace Munay, head ot the Near East Bureau of the State Department. 14. Tehran Water Supply. The question of a piped water supply for the capital is again under discus sion. The present scheme envisages the harnessing of the Kerej Rr\ei (mil sheet No. 9, square D 1) 21 miles west of Tehran and the laying of conduit pi] e. reservoirs north of the city. Several foreign firms are submitting tenders. 15. Iranian Baluchistan. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 13. Quetta Intelligence Bureau reports that Iranian troops and Ammeh who were engaged in operations against the Ismailzais have returned to their peace stations. he tribe have submitted and have agreed to live at peace with their neighbours The authorities propose now establishing two permanent posts in Ismailzai limits. Nazar Muhammad, a cousin of Juma Khan, has been appointed Sirdai ot the Ismailzais and has agreed to co-operate. 16. French Interests. Diplomatic relations between the Imperial Government of Iran and the French Government have been broken off by order of His Imperial Majesty the * a It is stated that the Shah has taken great offence to reports in French news papers of the annual cat show held at the Salle Wagram m Farm Pictures of this show appeared in the Excelsior and other dailies of the 3rd December, com bined with headings such as “ Quand le Chat est Roi, Sa Ma.ieste le Chat “ Une Famille de Persans blancs dans leur ( age ouatee et tendue de Soieries, &amp;c. Immediate protests were made to the Quai d’Orsay by the Iranian Minister in Paris. M. Bonnet expressed his surprise at the protest and offered to make apologies The Iranian Minister again called on the French Foreign Minister « fpw davs later M Bonnet, owing to pressure of more urgent affairs, did not receive him but the Iranian Minister saw an Under-Secretary^ This, too is said to have caused offence to the Shah. The French Minister m Tehran was handed a formal notice of the “ breaking off of diplomatic relations at noon on the 29th^)ec^ renc ^i j e ^ atlon are p re p a ring to move at short notice on the receipt of instructions from Paris.5 17. The Press. The offensive against the foreign press continues. This time the following French newspapers and periodicals have been severely criticised :— The Petit Parisien. The Excelsior. L’Os a Moelle. The A uto. The Journal. Apparently there is a deliberate misunderstanding of the word “ chat ” for “Chah.” Otherwise the whole Iranian press is, as usual, sycophantic in its praise of the Shah and the Crown Prince, so much so, that it is becoming most tiresome reading. Articles, speeches or alleged interviews with foreigners all end up by stating that everything good in Iran is due solely to the beneficence of our well beloved Sovereign and his equally loved son!

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 1 for the period ending the 14th January, 1939. compiled hy the military attache to this legation. Tehran, January 14, 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 1 for the Period ending January 14, 1939. 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah continues in residence at the Imperial Palace. 2. The Royal Family. (i) On the 1st January His Royal Highness the Crown Prince paid a visit of inspection to the Lycee Darul Fanoun. During his visit His Royal Highness made a short speech emphasising the importance of a military career in preference to any other. He concluded by saying : “ We are all for our Shah, God and the country. (ii) On the 7th January, the fourth anniversary of the emancipation of Iranian women, their Royal Highnesses the Princess Shahdukht (Shams-ul-Mulk) Pahlavi and Princess (Ashraf-ul-Muluk) Pahlavi attended a reunion at the Tehran Ladies Club in the Khiaban Sipah. They were received at the club entrance by the club president, Mme. Daulat Abadi, and a guard of honour of girl guides. After the president had read a report on the club’s activities, a musical and theatrical programme was given. During the course of the evening a telegram of grateful thanks and devotion was sent to His Imperial Maiestv the Shah for the granting of social equality to women. The Tehran Ladies’ Club, which has a membership of over 500, has facilities for social gatherings, tennis, physical culture, dancing, amateur theatricals &amp;c Lectures are also regularly given by experts on subjects of feminine interest. 3. Iranian Officials. (i) Dr. Mohammad Sadjaddi, Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Roads and Communications, at present officiating'as Acting Minister has been confirmed as Acting Minister of Roads and Communications. (ii) M. Hassan Farzan, late of the Ministry of the Interior has been appointed Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Roads and Communications vice Dr. Mohammad Sadjaddi. (iii) M. Ghulam Hassein Ibtehaj (Military Attache s Personalities No 117 Foreign Office Personalities, No. 66) has been appointed deputy head of the Tehran Municipality in addition to his own duties in the Ministry of Interior 4. The Iranian Army. tii Units of all arms of tbo TAlirnn i i ’-'J' cinva iicavj' [505 gg—3]2 Preparatory to the advance, the infantry were well extended and had utilised available cover, excepting the officers who were standing about conspicuously. This, however, may have been for instructional purposes as all the officers seen were wearing greatcoat and swords. Several light tanks were seen to be in difficulties when crossing a dry boulder- strewn nullah. Obviously no attempt had been made to reconnoitre a route previously. (ii) A British civilian eye-witness at the funeral of the late Turkish President states that the Iranian contingent did not distinguish themselves either in soldierly bearing, turn-out or marching. Many were out of step and they kept up a con tinual stamping during the procession. The German contingent was also very noisy. The Russian contingent were one of the best, being well turned out and drilled. (iii) An Ahwaz consular report states that a special travelling commission composed of representatives of the Ministries of the Interior, Justice, War, Education, &amp;c., on a recent visit to Khuzistan, have discovered that several senior officers of the 6th Khuzistan Division were implicated in extensive smuggling operations and corrupt dealings with the local tribes. Considerable quantities of smuggled goods have been found in the houses of nearly all military officers. Sarhang (Colonel) Jamshir, Divisional Chief of Staff has been arrested and is in military custody. The General Officer Commanding Sar Lashgar (Major-General) Muini is also under strong suspicion as he has been making extensive purchases of land in Resht, his own district. Sar Lashgar Muini has, however, taken energetic and apparently successful steps to discredit the findings of the travelling commission by attributing it to enmity, jealously, &amp;c. Never theless, it is probable that he will be replaced in the near future. There is no doubt that the military authorities have been bleeding the local Arabs, so much so that the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab has lost numbers of its population who have fled into Iraq. This is having a marked effect on the grain produced in the province which formerly exported its surplus wheat and barley. 5. The Iranian Air Force. (i) It is reliably reported that the Iranian Government has asked Messrs Handley Page for quotations for the “Hampden” bomber. They have also approached the Bristol Aeroplane Company (Ltd.) in connexion with the purchase of six long-nosed “Blenheim” bombers and twenty-four Mercury VIII engines. The Iranian Government are also obtaining tenders for the supply of bomber aircraft and engines from other aircraft producing countries. Delivery dates are specially asked for. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 of 1938, paragraph 7 (ii). Eighteen of the new Hind machines have already been flown from Ahwaz and aie now at Qila Murgha Military Aerodrome where they are being tried out. The remaining seventeen are expected to arrive during the month. (iii) Eourteen “ Audax ” machines belonging to No. 1 Air Regiment at Qila Murgha have been sent into the aircraft factory at Doshantappeh for ur°’ent overhaul, after which they are to be allotted to the new squadron which is to be formed at Tabriz. It is interesting to note that the flight from Ahwaz to Tehran by the “ Hind ” machine is done in little more than two and three-quarter hours. ’ (iv) Mr. L. Knight, acting technical adviser to the Imperial Iranian Air Force and employed at the aircraft factory, has declined to renew his contract when it expires on the 15th May of this year. His reasons for this step is the state of chaos existing at the factory as a result of the constant disregard of his advice by the air force authorities. 6. The Majlis. The Majlis have recently passed several important and interesting measures. Among these is an act for the readjustment of house and shop rents. The intention of this law is to force down the exorbitant rents imposed by landlords and to protect tenants from being evicted in favour of anyone offering higher rent. During the past few years there has been a decided movement fronTthei 1039 ! rds n countryside to the cities where, owing to housing shortage, landl ^rc reaping a rich harvest by increasing rents annually. The Bill, wKicti has now' been passed into law, fixes rents for the next three years at the rent figure charged in Mehr 1315 (September-October 1936). Penalties include from three to twelve &lt;^*months correctional imprisonment and fines varying from 5 to 50,000 rials. I he general concensus of opinion appears to be that rents were already on the downward trend owing to the recent large building construction and that landlords have themselves backed this law so as to keep rents up at a peak period when there really was a housing shortage. In any case, it is thought that the landlords will manage to find a means of circumventing this law. Another important law is the proposed establishment of an office for the “ Enlightment of Public Opinion.” Briefly it is intended to set up a general council in the capital for this purpose. This will be composed of representatives from the university, schools, adult educational authorities, boy scouts and girl guides officials and the press bureau, &amp;c. Public opinion will be moulded by means of the press, school books, books of general interest, public meetings, theatres, cinemas, radio broadcasts, concerts and patriotic songs. Sub-committees responsible for the vigorous organisation and preparation of each of the above subjects are to be formed and will commence drawing up programmes. It is mentioned in the Act that when the Tehran Broadcasting Station is opened this year loud speakers will be erected in all important towns and villages throughout the country. The members of the general council and sub-committees have already been nominated, and the first meeting has taken place. 7. Treaties and A greements. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 11 of 1938, paragraph 12. Treaties of Friendship between Iran, the x\rgentine and Mexico respectively have been ratified. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 6 of 1938, paragraph 3. The Clearing Agreement between Iran and Switzerland has been cancelled. (iii) Iran has become a signatory to the International Convention on Submarine Warfare, dated the 6th November, 1936. 8. The Use of Latin Script. Continuing the energetic campaign for the complete suppression of all Latin i script, the Ministry of Education have circulated all schools and colleges forbidding the use of Latin script in algebra and physics. All letters or figures \ must be written in Persian. The circular goes on to say that all formulas used in chemistry written in Greek or Latin script will also gradually be replaced by Persian signs, &amp;c., which will be communicated later. In this connexion it may be mentioned that the British personnel employed ] at the aircraft factory are now experiencing considerable difficulty in finding any of the 20,000 spare parts required for the construction of “ Audax ” aircraft as the British wording and figures has recently been deleted from the index cards. Works orders also are now solely written in Persian. It is known that His' 1 Imperial Majesty the Shah is the main instigator of this campaign. 9. Adult Education. According to a press report, the number of persons attending adult education courses is 124,233. These classes are normally held in the evenings and are steadily growing in popularity. Amongst those attending are peasants, masons, labourers, bath attendants, butchers, chauffeurs, waiters, &amp;c. 10. Communications. (i) Railways .—-Reference Intelligence Summary No. 26 of 1938, para graph 9 (ii). Messrs. Consortium Kampsax have not succeeded in arranging a new contract for further railway construction. There is a well-founded rumour I now that the Iranian Government may themselves undertake construction assisted by Czechoslovakian engineers, whose services can be obtained cheaply. (ii) An interesting report states that one of the reasons for M. Ahi’s (late Minister of Roads and Communications) dismissal was his strong insistence on the new Tabriz-Tehran line being of the same gauge as the Tabriz-Julfa line inorder to assist trade and have direct through communication with Europe. The gauge of the Trans-Iranian Railway is European standard (4 feet 8^ inches), and the Tabriz-Julfa Railway is Russian standard (5 feet). (iii) Country Roads .—The Ministry of Roads and Communications have issued detailed orders for the urgent construction of village roads. The intention^, is that each village worthy of the name should be connected to the main roads or to the nearest market town by a road passable in all weathers. Grants-in-aid will be made to rural councils. 11. French Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 26 of 1938, paragraph 16. According to reliable French sources, the Iranian Minister in Paris saw M. Bonnet, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 13th December, but made no repre sentations or complaints. The sudden breaking off of diplomatic relations was thus decided upon with no previous warning or discussion. Following the official notification of the rupture of diplomatic relations, an extraordinary situation has arisen in Tehran. The French Minister, M. Albert Bodard, formerly at Addis Ababa and present during the Italo-Ethiopian campaign, has received no definite instructions to leave Iran. He himself is ill and unable to travel. All the members of the French Mission and, indeed, most of the French colony, are insistent that the legation leave Iran immediately as it is considered that the longer it remains the worse it will be for French interests. M. Bodard does not, however, agree with this view. It is possible that M. Bodard and the Quai d’Orsay may be attempting to find a channel through which French explanations may be brought to the Shah, as certainly none of the Cabinet Ministers will dare mention the matter again to their Royal master. News was received in Tehran on the 9th January that M. Anushirwan Sipahbudi (Military Attache's Personalities No. 282), Iranian Minister in Paris, together with his mission, had been recalled. It is an interesting fact that in the archives of the Iranian Foreign Office there is a report, dated 1867, from the Persian Minister in Paris to Nasir-ud-din- Shah complaining that the street urchins frequently made cat-calls after him in the street, and even outside the open windows of his official residence. Nasir-ud- din-Shah wrote in the margin of this despatch: “ I consider it beneath the dignity of my representative to take notice of such rudeness. I do not wish to hear anything further of this matter! ” Unfortunately, the present Shah can be infuriated by some article in even the most obscure publication of the foreign press, and this is naturally a source of anxiety as he may take his revenge in some unforeseen manner. 12. Mercantile Marine. The Ministry of Finance have asked for tenders for the construction of three modern cargo steamers each of 5,000 tons and fitted with Diesel oil-burning engines. These cargo steamers will have a number of passenger cabins and will also be fitted with refrigerating chambers. The ships are to be handed over in the Persian Gulf. Those interested are asked to apply to the financial secretary at the Iranian Legation in Berlin. This confirms a report that His Imperial Majesty wishes Iran to have its own mercantile marine. H. J.

(iv) M. Ali Akbar Bahman (Military Attache's Personalities, No. 56— Foreign Office Personalities, No. 44) former Iranian Ambassador at Kabul has been appointed ambassador at Cairo. p) Not printed. [ 530 U— 1 ]4. The Iranian Army. (i) It is reliably reported that certain divisions and independent brigades of the Iranian army will shortly be grouped into army corps. (ii) An independent mechanised brigade consisting of three regiments has been formed in Tehran. Repair workshops have already been constructed and the necessary machinery (supplied by a German firm) is being installed. - Brigade headquarters— General Officer Commanding, Sarhang (Colonel), acting Sartip (Brigadier) Ahdi. Chief of the General Staff, Sarhang (Colonel) Ibrahim Arfa. Attached, one section of motor cyclists. Troops— 1st Regiment (anti-aircraft) consisting of two battalions. 2nd Regiment (A.F.V.’s) consisting of two battalions of tanks and two companies of armoured cars. 3rd Regiment (machine-gun unit) consisting of two battalions with fifty cars each. (iii) His Imperial Majesty the Shah has ordered the following transfers of divisional commanders to take place forthwith :— (a) Sarlashgar (Major-General) Mohammad Mohtashimi, General Officer Commanding 4th (Eastern Azerbaijan) Division, to be General Officer Commanding 9th (Khorasan) Division. {h) Sarlashgar (Major-General) Said Ahmad Muini, General Officer Commanding 6th (Khuzistan) Division, to be General Officer Commanding 3rd (Western Azerbaijan) Division. (&lt;?) Sarlashgar (Major-General) Mohammad Shahbakhti, General Officer Commanding 3rd (Western Azerbaijan) Division, to be General Officer Commanding 6th (Khuzistan) Division. (d) Sarlashgar (Major-General) Iraj Khan Matbui, General Officer Commanding 9th (Khorasan)' Division, to be General Officer Commanding 4th (Eastern Azerbaijan) Division. (iv) It is reported, but as yet unconfirmed, that the Ministry of War have placed an order for an unknown number of motor cycles and side-cars with a Government factory in Belgium. It is understood that a machine gun with ammunition and tripod is carried on the side-car, while the machine gunner rides behind the driver on a pillon seat. (v) According to a consular report, three anti-aircraft guns have been issued to the 7th (Ears) Division as part of their normal equipment. 5. The Iranian A ir Force. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 5 (iii). Sarhang (Colonel) Shaibani has been selected to command the new air squadron to be stationed at Tabriz. An unconfirmed report states that this squadron will leave for Tabriz on the 22ncl February. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 5 (iv). As a result of Mr. Knight’s explanation of his refusal to renew his contract with the Iranian air force, active steps are being taken by the Ministry of War to enquire into the management of the aircraft factory. This is causing considerable anxiety among certain high ranking officers of the Iranian air force. 6. The French Military Mission. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 of 1938, paragraph 5. The French Military Mission have now left Iran. Colonel Henriet and Lieutenant-Colonel Pechaud Chalret du Rieu, on bidding farewell to the Minister of War, were both handed the Order of Humayun, 4th Class. 7. French Interests. On the 13th January Commandant R. Leleu, the French military attache, received telegraphic instructions from the French War Ministry ordering himi 3 to return to France forthwith without waiting for his relief. He was ordered to hand over his archives to the Chancery of the French Legation and to place the services of his adjutant (clerk) at the disposal of the French Minister. No reason was given for this sudden recall of the military attache, but it is thought possible that the French War Ministry regard the dismissal of the ^^military mission as an insult and have therefore recalled their representative. The French Minister and the remaining members of the French mission still linger in Tehran. It is now said that diplomatic relations will be resumed shortly, as His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and his suite still intend travelling to Egypt via Syria and Beirut. 8. Egyptian Interests. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 27 of 1938, paragraph 7. A communique of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, dated the 25th January, states that both the Egyptian Legation in Tehran and the Iranian Legation in Cairo have been raised to the status of embassies. (ii) The Iranian press continue to publish articles on Egypt; the majority of these are historical, accentuating, where possible, some parallel between Iranian and Egyptian development. Topical articles on Egyptian affairs are also featured. 9. Iranian Rubber Factory. Authentic information has been received that the Shah has given instruc tions for a budget to be prepared for the construction of a factory in the vicinity of Tehran for the manufacture of motor tyres and inner tubes and rubber goods generally. 10. The Baluchistan Frontier—Iranian Survey. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 9 of 1938, paragraph 7, and Intelligence Summary No. 11 of 1938, paragraph 15. The frontier survey has been resumed and the survey of the border between Kila Sufaid and Jozzak has already been completed. The head of the survey party is M. Mohsen Ansari. For the present, the town of Mirjawa is being used as the base. 11. Iranian Baluchistan. According to a consular report, the military authorities have already collected over 200 rifles from the defeated Ismailzais. The name of this tribe has been changed to C£ Shahbakhsh ” by order of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. The General Officer Commanding 8th (Mekran) Division, Sartip (Brigadier) Syed Mahmud Amini, has now called upon the Yarmondzais, Gamshadzais and other Baluch tribes to surrender all arms in their possession, and he has threatened to use force if his order is not complied with. 12. The A nglo-lranian Oil Company. The company have recently increased their air fleet by the purchase of four seven-seater De Havilland ££ Rapide ” aircraft. These have already been delivered at Abadan. 13. Communications. The construction of all-weather roads from Abadan to Ahwaz and thence to the oil-fields will shortly be undertaken by the local authorities in co-operation with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The roads will be of asphalt and of special design. 14. The Imperial Bank of Iran. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 27 of 1938, paragraph 6. The discussions between the representatives of the Imperial Bank of Iran, the Exchange Commission and the Ministry of Finance are reported to be progressing satisfactorily.4 A- 15. Public Welfare. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 of 1938, paragraph 12, and Intelligence Summary No. 27 of 1938, paragraph 11. A medical practitioner has written to the press stressing the difficulties that doctors will experience in making correct diagnosis. He appeals to the Ministry of Justice to take into consideration the severity of penalties to he inflicted on doctors who issm** incorrect certificates. 16. The Majlis. (i) The sum of £300,000 sterling has been voted from Government reserves towards the cost of railway construction (buildings and sidings) at Bandar Shahpur. (ii) A Bill for the creation of the Mortgage Bank of Iran with an initial capital of 200 million rials (£2£ million) is now under discussion. 17. Broadcasting.

Tehran, February 18, 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 3 for the Period ending February 11, 1939. 1. The Shah. At the Gulistan Palace on the 8th February (Id-i-Ghadir) His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, received the homage and congratulations of various officials and civil deputations. 2. The Crown Prince. His Royal Highness the Crown Prince visited the Tehran University Medical School on the 9th February, the anniversary of its foundation. The dean of the Faculty of Medicine received His Royal Highness and made a short speech of welcome, in which he pointed out that the modern study of medicine in Tehran had begun over eighty-nine years ago. His Royal Highness, in addressing the students, said : “ After the army, the nation requires doctors. Just as the army defends our country, doctors must also defend it against disease. Our two professions must therefore unite and combine to preserve the nation against plagues and dangers, both exterior and interior. I hope you will not just endeavour to obtain a degree of doctor of medicine. Having accomplished that, your hardest task is only just beginning. You must continue your never-ending studies by experiments, personal observation and investigation and the use of modern methods.” He concluded by saying : “ We will do our utmost to give you all possible assistance in your careers.” After inspecting the various lecture-halls and laboratories, His Royal Highness shook hands with the professors and students before leaving. It is interesting to note that medical students carry out a six-year course of study, combined with practical work in the Tehran civil hospitals, before obtaining their diplomas. The course of study in pharmacy lasts four years and dental surgery three years. The present numbers of students are reported to be as under :— Medical ... ... ... ... ... ... 456 Pharmacy ... ... ... 146 Dentistry ... ... ... ... ... 27 3. British Interests. The Government of India have notified the selection of Major C. G. Prior, C.I.E., Indian Political Service, as Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and consul-general at Bushire vice Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard C. W. Fowle. K.C.I.E., C.B.E., who vacates the appointment on the 1st September. 1939. [555 k—3] B2 Major Prior has already served in the Persian Gulf as political agent, Bahrein, 1929-32. the question of the necessity of a consul-general at Bushire may well be brought up by the Iranian Government when Major Prior’s agrement is presented. With this is bound up the question of the transfer of the Residency to Bahrein. 4. Iranian Officials. (i) M. Ali Soheili (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 283, Foreign Office Personalities No. 200), late Minister for Foreign Affairs, has been appointed Ustandar (Governor-General) of Kerman to fill an existing vacancy. (ii) M. Ali Ashgar Hikmat (Military Attache’s Personalities No. Ill, Foreign Office Personalities No. 99), late Minister of Education, has been appointed Ustandar (Governor-General) of Azerbaijan to fill an existing vacancy. This is as yet unconfirmed. (iii) M. Anushirwan Sipahbudi (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 282), Iranian Minister in Paris, who had been recalled after the rupture of Franco- Iranian diplomatic relations, arrived in Tehran during the period under review. He is reported to be under open arrest and is confined to his house. (iv) M. Ibrahim Alam (Foreign Office Personalities No. 195), Governor- General of Fars since September 1937, has been appointed Minister of Posts and Telegraphs vice M. Muhammad Hakimi. 5. The A nglo-Iranian Oil Company. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 24 of 1938, paragraph 11. (i) The scheme for the construction of the new Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s refinery on a site just north of Mashur in one of the inlets of the Khor Musa (see map 1 to the military report on the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s (South Iranian) Oilfields Area, 1936) is still under consideration in London. The estimated cost is said to be nearly £30 million. Several stiff engineering problems are involved, such as the construction of firm foundations for the refinery itself on ground which is low lying and liable to flooding, the piping of sweet water from reservoirs over 30 miles away and the deepening of channels for oil tankers to berth alongside. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 26 of 1938, paragraph 12. The company’s representatives are experiencing considerable difficulty in obtaining the whole of the Iranian coastline in their concession area. It is anticipated that this will have to be modified and other areas selected in lieu. 6. Broadcasting. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 17. The British company, Messrs. Standard Telephones and Cables, will erect the following equipment at Bisim (Qasr-i-Kajar), on the Tehran-Shimran road, during the next fourteen months :— (a) Central equipment. (5) One 20-kw. short-wave broadcasting, telephone and telegraph transmitter. {c) One 2-kw. idem. This 2-kw. transmitter is also to be used as a second bi oadcasting transmitter on medium waves, duplicating the equioment ordered from Telefunken in January 1938. (d) One 700-h.p. Brush Diesel, capable of supplying the total power required at the transmitting centre. (e) Eight-kw. loaded cable to connect transmitting centre to the central office (/) Studio equipment. (g) Privacy equipment to permit secret telephone communications with Europe and the United States. (h) Two mobile broadcasting transmitters. (i) Two portable outside broadcast equipments. (;) Recording equipment. The total value of the above contract is £45,000.Messrs.

Gurgan (Asterahad). Isfahan. Sanandaj (Senneh). Rezaieh. The work will be completed by February 1940. The total value of contract is 407,000 reichsmarks. Messrs. Telefunken have already begun the construction of a medium-wave broadcasting transmitter at Bisim. This was ordered in January 1938 and will be completed by September of this year. 7. Wireless Telegraphy and Telephones. Powerful short-wave telegraph and telephone equipment is being erected at Bisim. It is expected that this will be handed over after tests early in 1940 by Messrs. Telefunken. 8. Wireless News. The police have recently forbidden proprietors of hotels, restaurants and cafes in Tehran and the provinces to permit the broadcast news of foreign countries to be heard on their premises. 9. Internal Propaganda. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 6. Since the passing of the law providing for the establishment of an office for the enlighten ment of public opinion, a series of articles have appeared in the press emphasising the importance of the above measure. Various official meetings have been held and further sub-committees appointed. The professors of the Tehran University have also been detailed to give lectures on subjects in connexion with this propaganda. This law is clearly inspired by the German model, but it is doubtful whether it will have any real effect. The Iranian public as it is have no opportunity of expressing their feelings on matters of national concern. 10. German Interests. His Excellency Dr. Hans Smend,the German Minister, has returned to Tehran after a prolonged leave in Germany. 11. Polish Interests. His Excellency M. Jan Karszo-Siedlewsky has been appointed Minister for Poland in Iran. He is also accredited to Iraq and Afghanistan. 12. French Interests. (i) In spite of the fact that diplomatic relations between France and Iran are still broken off, the new French military attache, Chef de Bataillon Alessandri, arrived in Tehran on the 1st February. Whilst en route he received orders to halt at Bucharest pending further instructions. After ten days’ delay he was instructed by the French Ministry of War to continue his journey to Tehran. He was surprised to find that his predecessor, Commandant Leleu, had been recalled to France. (ii) M. Mathis, chief representative of Messrs. Schneiders, has been imprisoned. The late French military attache before his departure handed over to M. Mathis a quantity of wines, which the latter removed openly to his residence. Shortly afterwards he was arrested by the police and the liquor seized. M. Mathis maintains he was only keeping the wines for the new French military attache to whom they were to be handed over, and produced documentary evidence to this effect from Commandant Leleu. During a police search of M. Mathis’ residence firearms were found for which no permits had been granted or sought. [555 k—3] n 2 Resht. Kermanshah. ^ Babul. Meshed. Tabriz. Shiraz.I he trench Legation have intervened on M. Mathis’ behalf, but little can be done in the present difficult circumstances. At present no one is allowed to visit him in prison. The police authorities are said to be demanding a fantastic sum in francs for his release. (iii) The Iranian Legation in Paris has been closed. Iranian interests are. for the time being, looked after by the Egyptian Legation there. 13. U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) His Excellency M. Alexei Tchernikh, the Soviet Ambassador, is reported to have died a natural death in Russia whilst he was on leave. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 18. It is contirmed that, at the request of the Soviet Government, an Iranian Trade Delegation has proceeded to Moscow on the 5th January. The delegation is composed of the following :— M. Sadiq V assighi. Acting Minister of Commerce. M. Allah Yar Saleh, Un der-Secretary of Finance. M. Delpak, Director of the 2nd Political Bureau in the Ministrv for Foreign Affairs. 14. The Marriage Ceremonies. (i) Hon. Major-General the Earl of Athlone, K.G., P.C..

He will be accompanied by Her Royal Highness Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, G.B.E. (n) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 2 (ii). Arrangements are now in hand for the accommodation, feeding and entertainment or the British naval detachment. The Protocol Department of the Ministrv for roreign Anairs desire that the detachment be the guests of the Imperial Govern- ment at the Officers’ Club in Tehran. This honour may, however, have to be declined for good and sufficient reason. One of the Royal special trains has been offered and accepted for the S^eyance of the detachment from Bandar Shahpur to Tehran on or about the (iii) It is reliably reported that the Italian Government are detailing twe destroyers as naval escort from 18° latitude to the Straits of the Bab-el-Mandeb. (iy) Ihe merchants and shop-owners of Tehran are being compelled to assessed sums of money for the various expenses in connexion with the Crown Prince s wedding. In the provinces they are subscribing in the same manner towards wedding gifts, &amp;c. This is in accordance with Iranian custom. 15. The Iranian A ir Force. fi™ IV 5 eference ..

Two stations, one at Kurdan the other at langi Jmam (Degree Sheet No. 9 I—Square C 1). and 190 small bridges are to be constructed. Work is to be completed by February 1940. The contractors are an Iranian firm assisted by Czecho-Slovakian engineers. 17. The Iranian Army. (i) It is reliably reported that the Ecole militaire of Tehran is to be enlarged. All pupils of the 5th and 6th classes now attending military schools in the provinces will be drafted to the Tehran military school to complete their studies. The number of pupils now attending the school is just over 700. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 4 (iv). It is confirmed that an order has been placed with the Fabrique nationale beige for fifty motor cycles and side-cars. These combinations are of the same pattern as those used with much success in the 1938 manoeuvres of the Belgian army. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

Tehran, March 3, 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 4 for the Period ending February 25, 1939. 1. The Shah. (i) ON the evening of the 21st February His Imperial Majesty the Shah gave a banquet at the new and well-equipped officers’ club of Tehran to some 2,000 senior officers of the Imperial Iranian army, navy and air force. The majority of the officers present were of the Tehran garrison. The Turkish Military Attache was the only foreign attache to be invited. After the banquet, His Imperial Majesty made a short speech, which was relayed by loud speakers to the different dining-rooms. The Shah said he was proud of the progress achieved by his army and fully relied on their fidelity and zeal in the future. He concluded by proposing the toast of the “ Imperial Forces/’ The Acting Chief of the General Staff, Sarlashgar (Major-General) Azizullah Zarghami (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 308—Foreign Office Personalities No. 215), replied for “ The Armed Forces.’ Afterwards there was a firework display in the grounds of the club. (ii) On the afternoon of the 22nd February His Imperial Majesty, accompanied by the Crown Prince, reviewed the Tehran garrison and youth organisations at the Jalalieh race-course in commemoration of the eighteenth anniversary of the coup d’Etat. (A separate report has been submitted.) (iii) It is reliably stated that the Shah proposes carrying out a prolonged tour of inspection in Khuzistan and the south in the near future. (iv) Junior members of the Royal family have lately been taking an increasing share in public duties. TKeir Royal Highnesses Princess Shahdukdt Pahlavi (Shams-ul-Mulk) and Prince Shahpur Hamid Reza (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 206) have attended the distribution of prizes at the local schools, including the Zoroastrian School. 2. The Crown Prince. His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, accompanied by the suite referred to in Intelligence Summary No. 27 of 1938, paragraph* 2, left Tehran at 08-00 hours on Friday, the 24th February, for Egypt via Bagdad and Syria Members of the Cabinet and other Court officials were present at the Marble Palace and accompanied His Royal Highness to Kerej, 21 miles from the city. Students and over 600 boy scouts lined the avenues leading out of the citv. [555 u—1] B3. The Marriage Ceremonies. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 14 (ii). The strength of the naval detachment detailed for the wedding celebrations in Tehran is as follows :— The Commander-in-chief, East Indies Squadron. Officers (personal staff) ... ... ... ... ‘2 Officers ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 Chief petty officers ... ... ... ... ... 1 Ratings ... ... ... ... ... ... 58 Bandmaster ... ... ... ... ... 1 Others (bandsmen) ... ... ... ... ... 19 (ii) The Royal yacht on which their Royal Highnesses the Crown Prince and Princess of Iran will return to Iran is the steamship Mohamed Ali El Kebir, of the Pharaonic Line. (iii) The Imperial Iranian Government, acting on instructions from His Imperial Majesty the Shah, have insisted on all foreign detachments being their guests. The British detachment will therefore be accommodated as under:— The commander-in-chief and officers in the officers’ club. Naval ratings in the military college. 4. Travellers: British Officers. Lieutenant P. Parry-Evans, 3rd Battalion (Rattray’s Sikhs) 11th Regiment, arrived in Tehran from Bagdad on the 11th February and left for India via Meshed and Zahidan on the 16th February. He was delayed in Tehran owing to sickness. 5. Iranian Officials. His Excellency All Ashgar Hikmat (Military Attache s Personalities No. Ill—Foreign Office Personalities No. 99), late Minister of Education, has been appointed Minister of Interior, and not as stated in Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 9 (ii). 6. Language Officers: R A F. Squadron-Leader V. Harris, Royal Air Force, arrived in Tehran on the 8th February on four months’ language study. On obtaining his visa to enter Iran, he was informed that the Imperial Iranian Government insisted on his residing in the capital for his study, and not in the provinces. Increasing difficulties are being made for language students to study in the piovinces. Lieutenant P. G. B. McNalty, 2nd Royal Lancers, who has been in the country since October 1938, has not yet obtained his yermis de sejour. He has been ordered by the local police authorities at Shiraz to proceed to Tehran to obtain this. The matter is, however, under discussion with the competent authorities. r 7. Obituary. M. Ksaweiy Zalewsky, the Polish Charge d Affaires, died in Tehran on the morning of the 17th February. A memorial service was held on the 20th February prior to cremation. 8. Polish Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 11. His Imperial Majesty the Shah received in audience at the Gulistan Palace his Excellency M. Jan Karszo-Siedlewsky, the new minister for Poland, who presented his letters of credence. 9. French Interests. On the 21st February, following an exchange of telegrams between the French President, M. Albert Lebrun, and His Imperial Majestv the Shah, diplomatic relations between the two countries were once again restored. Theprecedent established in the settlement of this affair is considered most unfortunate. A translation of the Shah telegram which appeared in the press is given below :— I he receipt of your Excellency’s friendly telegram has given us an opportunity of expressing once again our lively satisfaction and sincere personal regard for your Excellency, whom we have always recognised as a true friend of Iran and of ourselves. “ We hasten to assure your Excellency that we feel no resentment towards yourself. We wish at the same time to take this opportunity of explaining the reasons which compelled us against our will to take our recent decision. “ Our action was not solely inspired by the publication of certain offensive articles in the press. For several years past we have had the impression that the French public were not fully aware of the changes which have taken place in our country and have made no effort to understand the new Iran. “ These sentiments, which the French press have echoed, compelled us to break off relations between our two countries and to postpone their re-establishment until France should show that she is ready to appreciate our country in its true light. “ However, in view of the respect which we feel for your Excellency, we are willing to let the past be forgotten and to re-establish diplomatic relation's. “ We expect your Excellency, whose good intentions are evident, to devote particular attention to the establishment of these relations on a sound basis of confidence and mutual understanding, in order that we may be spared the repetition of such regrettable incidents in the future.” (ii) It is rumoured that for some time past His Royal Highness the Crown Prince has been pressing his august father to arrange matters prior to his (the Crown Prince) journey to Egypt via Syria. (iii) His Excellency M. Bodard, the French Minister is still seriously ill and confined to his bed. 10. U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) A Soviet agricultural mission of three experts has arrived in Iran to study the question of the movement and destruction of locusts. (ii) It is reliably reported that a Soviet aeroplane, carrying three or four officers, escaped from U.S.S.R. territory on or about the 12th February and landed at Khananrud (presumably meant for Khanrud—degree sheet No. 8 B, square D 3) a village near Heriz in Azerbaijan. The occupants surrendered themselves to the Iranian authorities and are now in custody at Tabriz. 11. Italian Interests. The Italian naval attache states that his Government have asked the Iranian Government for permission to nominate a military attache to the Italian Legation in Tehran. This officer will hold the rank of colonel and will also be accredited to Angora. 12. The Iranian Army. (i) Troops of the 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions and Independent Mechanised Brigade took part in the annual review at the Jalalieh race-course on the 22nd February. (ii) 7,000 conscripts due for discharge in January were retained with the colours to take part in the review. (iii) A reliable report states that officers are to have a full dress uniform. The coat will be khaki with gold shoulder straps and rank insignia in gold braid on the sleeves. High collar with tabs showing arm of the service. Trousers (slacks) will be of plain khaki of the same material as the coat. (iv) His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz reports having heard Sarlashgar (Major-General) Muini inform a senior Iranian civil official that the Shah had approved in principle the 6th Khuzistan) Division being increased to four mixed [555 u—1] b 2brigades and the troops at Khorramabad were to be brought up to brigade strength immediately. The remaining three brigades were to be centred in Ahwaz (less detachments). The general went on to say that this policy could not be carried out until suitable barrack accommodation had been provided and this would take several years. (v) It is reported, but as yet unconfirmed, that the Iranian Government ar^ interested in the purchase of a number of “Hurricane” fighter aircraft. (vi) It is reported from Czecho-Slovakian sources that the Iranian Govern ment have placed an order for an unknown number of tanks and machine guns. 13. The Imperial Bank of Iran. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 27 of 1938, paragraph 6 and Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 14. The board of directors of the Imperial Bank of Iran have ordered the bank’s branches at Zahidan and Yezd to be closed forthwith. The closing of the branch at Bushire has been suspended for the time being. The closing down of the Yezd branch is regretted as with the opening up of the Anarak mining area, and the possible extension of the Trans-Iranian Railway to Yezd and Kerman, and possibly to India trade would increase in these centres. A number of the London staff of the bank have been axed, and it is probable that several of the older and pensionable European members of the bank in Iran may go earlier than anticipated. Negotiations with the Exchange Commission and the Ministry of Finance are now reported to be more hopeful. 14. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 6. (i) It is reliably reported that the company have commenced negotiations for the acquisition of 20 square miles of land in the vicinity of Bandar Mashur village (degree sheet No. 10 F. square A 2) of approximately 2.000 inhabitants, but excluding the village itself. (ii) The company’s geologists and surveyors are now testing for oil by the “shot” system in the vicinity of Bandar Abbas and Qishm Island. The tests are reported to be very promising, but it will be necessary to sink shafts within the next few months to ascertain the centre of the oil field. 15. The Trans-Iranian Railway. The following locomotives have been ordered from Germany for the Trans- Iranian Railway :— Hamschel and Shon of Cassel Krupp of Essen ... Tesslingen 32 24 9 16. Deutsche Lufthansa. It has been ascertained that the crews of the Deutsche Lufthansa Air Line are changed for each journey, none of the pilots or crew carry out the journey more than twice, further they are all members of the German military air force. The crew consists of :— Pilot. Relief pilot. Wireless operator. Engineer. 17. Refugees. Iranian deportees from the U.S.S.R. continue to arrive in small numbers. A consular report from Bandar Abbas states that approximately forty-five deportees have been placed on Qishm Island. This confirms the report contained in Intelligence Summary No. 27 of 1938, paragraph 10.5 18. Iranian Baluchistan. A press report states that the name of the Yarmohdzais of Mekran has been changed to “ Shahnawaz.” 19. Public Economy. P A serious attempt is now being made to reduce the very high cost of living in Iran, especially in the capital. The prices of bread and different meats have been compulsory reduced, and energetic action is being taken to ensure the proper working of the law for reduction of houses and shop rents referred to in Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 6.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 5 for the period ending the 11th March. 1939, prepared by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, March 16, 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 5 for the Period ending March 11, 1939. 1. The Shah. . . (i) On Monday, the 6th March, His Imperial Majesty the Shah left by Royal train for Khuzistan where he is making a prolonged tour of inspection of public works. ... . * i ™ -j (ii) A statue of His Majesty is being erected in the centre of the Maidan-i- Sipah (formerly Maidan-i-Topkhaneh). This is due to be unveiled on the 24th Esfand (15th March, 1939). the birthday of the Shah. The pedestal for the statue is of Khorassan granite, and twenty jets of water 7 metres high will play into two large basins on either side. This is the third statue of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to be erected in Tehran. 2. The Crown Prince. His Imperial Highness arrived in Cairo on the 4th March. The Iranian press publish long columns of his doings in Egypt from their special corres pondents. These messages contain nothing of human interest, but only give brief statements as in a court circular. All end up with the usual terms of respect and praise of their illustrious Crown Prince. A daily broadcast in Persian is o-iven from Cairo which is couched in similar terms. O 3. The Iranian Budget. The Minister of Finance, His Excellency Mahmud Bader (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 51—Foreign Office Personalities, No. 41), introduced the budget for the Iranian year 1318 (the 21st March, 1939-20th March. 1940) in the Majlis on the 26th February, 1939. During the course of a long explanatory speech, the Finance Minister stated that in accordance with previous legislation the revenue derived from the tea and sugar monopoly and the revenue from the road tax was used to finance roads and railways (construction and maintenance) and was kept as a special and separate account. During recent years, however, owing to the rapid extension of road and railway construction, this revenue did not cover the expenditure, and further substantial sums had had to be contributed annually from the State budget. The Government had therefore decided that the receipts from the tea and sugar monopoly and the road tax would in future be included in the general receipts of the country and road and railway expenditure met from this source. It was the intention of the Imperial Government to press on this year with the construction of the following railway lines :— (a) Semnan-Shahrud- Meshed. Million sheet No. 16, square B 1. Million sheet No. 15, square D 4. Million sheet No. 22, square D 4. [580 1—2]2 {b) Kazvin-Zinjan-Tabriz. Million sheet No. 8, square C 4. Million sheet No. 8, square A 4. Million sheet No. 1, square C 2. (c) Qum-Kashan-Yezd. Million sheet No. 9. square C 2. Million sheet No. 9, square D 3. Million sheet No. 17, square C 1. M. Bader added that the tea, sugar and road taxes would remain in force until such time as these essential railroads were completed, when they would be abolished. The 1318 budget is briefly as under :— Total expenditure ... 2,613,481,987 rials. £32,668,524 Total receipts 1.930,096,700 rials. £24,126,208 Excess of expenditure over receipts 683,385,287 rials. £8,542,316 It is interesting to note that this is the first occasion that a budget has been presented with an anticipated deficit. The Finance Minister explained that this deficit was due to extraordinary expenses in connexion with railway construction and other large schemes such as the construction of blast furnaces, a spinning mill in Tehran, a heavy repair workshop and a factory for the manufacture of electric batteries, &amp;c. The Finance Minister explained that after adjusting a large part of the deficit from trade profits, grants from State Reserve Funds and long-time credits, the actual possible deficit on the 1318 budget would be 383.385,285 rials (£4,792,316), which would be covered by unforeseen trade profits and/or by loans to be raised from internal banks. The Majlis, after a brief discussion on minor points, unanimously passed the budget. J F A comparison of items of military expenditure for the year 1317 and 1318 are as follows :— Minister of War ... Gendarmerie Conscription Forage account Corn account Pahlavi dockyard Year 1317. 323,729.980 rials £4,046,624 30,678,400 rials £383.480 1,150,500 rials £14,381 16.046.944 rials £200,586 17,246,132 rials £215,576 3,220.000 rials £40.250 Year 1318. 363,729,980 rials £4,546,624 35,678,400 rials £445,980 500,000 rials £6,250 16,000.000 rials £ 200,000 /Tc l o e o= t I :&gt; x ta i. mi ltary ex P endltur e&lt; therefore, amounts to 415,908,380 rials j wmg an mcrease over last year’s provision of 23,836,424 rials (£297,955) and representing 15 9 per cent, of the total budgeted expenditure. the usual extra £2 million has been voted for army requirements from the btate reserve funds to which all oil royalties pass. 4. The Iranian Air Force. (i) It is reliably reported that the Iranian air force authorities have ordered all aircraft m Tehran to be specially overhauled in preparation for the fly past on the 25th April. .r f ^ (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 15 M. The second batch of five “ Tiger-Moth ” machines have been delivered. The second batch of five Audax will be completed within six weeks, have already passed their tests. Two of the machines3 j» (in) (jood progress is being made with the manufacture of parts for the twenty ‘ Hind” aircraft which are to be constructed at the aircraft factory, but assemblage is being held up owing to a shortage of raw materials. (iv) Ft is reliably reported that ” Hurricane ” fighters will be produced next year after or simultaneously with the “ Hind ” machines. ^ (v) An unconfirmed report states that His Imperial Majesty the Shah desires a new aircraft factory to be constructed for the production of “ Blenheim ” bombers. ! he factory will not, it is understood, be in the vicinity of the present factory at Doshantappeh. (vi) I he Iranian air force high command are reported to be taking a great interest in A.R.P. 56 5. Iranian Officials. (i) It is reliably reported that once again all Government officials of grade III and upwards have been circularised as to their dealings and social intercourse with foreigners, both official and unofficial.

[E 2666/216/34] Copy No. 1 I o Mr. Seymour to Viscount Halifax .— (Received April 1:2.) (No. 92.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 6 for the period ending the 25th March, 1939, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, March 31, 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 6 for the Period ending March 25, 1939. 1. The Shah. (i) ON the 13th March His Imperial Majesty the Shah returned to the capital from his tour in Khuzistan. Whilst there he visited public works, railway and port administration buildings, &amp;c., both in Ahwaz and Bandar Shahpur. It is understood that the Shah took the opportunity of acquiring land on the right bank of the Karun River, near Ahwaz, for the erection of a palace. (ii) The 15th March, the 61st anniversary of the birthday of the Shah, was celebrated throughout Iran. According to the official press His Majesty was born on the 15th March, 1878, near Alasht (District of Sawad Kuh), of a noble family of warriors. In the evening a banquet, followed by a soiree, was given by his Excellency M. Mahmud Jam, the Prime Minister, and Mme. Jam at the Gulistan Palace in honour of the occasion. (iii) On the 22nd March (New Year’s Day) His Imperial Majesty received in audience at the Gulistan Palace from 8-00 hours till noon various official delegations and the Diplomatic Corps, who offered their congratulations and good wishes. The Diplomatic Corps were received in the Salle des Brilliants. The Turkish Ambassador, doyen of the corps, read a short speech of congratulation in Persian, to which the Shah replied in a voice scarcely audible. The Shah, accompanied by the Foreign Minister, walked round and listened to the heads of each mission tender their respective country’s congratulations. The Shah then shook hands with members of each mission. His Majesty appeared to be tired and bored with the whole proceedings, but was in good humour. 2. The Crown Prince. (i) The marriage contract between His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince and Her Royal Highness Princess Fouzieh of Egypt was signed at the Abdin Palace in Cairo on the 15th March. The ceremony, which is reported in the press as being very simple, was in accordance with Islamic Law. The only persons present besides His Majesty King Farouk of Egypt and the Crown Prince were Sheikh Mustafa-el-Moraghi, Rector of El Azhar University; their Excellencies Zulfakar Pasha; Morad Pasha: Dr. Matin Daftari (Iranian Minister of Justice) and Dr. Moadeh Nafisi (Grand Maitre de la Maison Civile of the Crown Prince). The contract of marriage was written and signed on specially-prepared durable parchment. A further marriage ceremony will take place in Tehran on the return of the Crown Prince and Princess. [580 m—'ll(ii) The press continue to publish long telegrams from hgypt, where the Royal hospitality is reported as having been lavish in the extreme. (iii) A consular report from Kermanshah states that the Crown Prince has caused a very unfavourable impression among the notables and townsfolk there by his arrogance, boorish indifference and lack of appreciation for the efforts and expense which all had been put to in decorating the town and preparing a warm welcome. 3. Iranian Officials. Among the New Year promotions are the following :— (i) Sarhang (Colonel) Khusrovani (M.A.’s Personalities No. 153), Chief ot the Iranian Air Force, to be Sartip (Brigadier). (ii) Sartip (Brigadier) Amir Khosrovi, president of the Banque-i-Mellie, to be Sar Lashgar (Major-General). 4. The Wedding Celebrations. (i) The construction of triumphal arches in the capital continues. It is rumoured that the Shah is displeased at the unnecessary expense and the elaborate arches being constructed by the Banque-i-Mellie (National Bank). (ii) A special issue of postage stamps commemorating the marriage is being printed and will be on sale to the public during the celebrations. 5. The Iranian Army. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), paragraph 12 (iii). Officers of the Iranian army appeared at Gulistan Palace on the 22nd March (New Year’s Day) wearing their new full dress uniform for the first time. The dress is as already described with the exception that gold epaulettes are worn instead of shoulder straps. The khaki is of a mustard shade in colour. The Crown Prince is wearing similar uniform in Egypt. (ii) It has been decided to absorb the gendarmerie (amnieh) in the army. As far as can be ascertained they will retain their status as amnieh, but will be attached to the various divisions of the army. It is said that the reasons for this step are the continued tranquillity existing amongst the tribes and the general improvement in public security and also as a measure of economy. The present blue uniform will be replaced bv khaki. The numbers affected are approximately 10 . 000 . (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 of 1938, paragraph 8 (iii). The two battalions of the 3rd (Bahadur) Infantry Regiment returned to Tehran in November 1938. 6. Egyptian Interests. His Excellency M. Yusuf Zulfakar Pasha, former president of the Mixed Courts of Appeal of Egypt, has been appointed Egyptian Ambassador in Iran in succession to his Excellency M. Abdel Latif Talaat Bey. 7. Afghan Interests. A press report states that his Excellency M. Mohammed Norouz Khan has been appointed Afghan Ambassador in Iran in succession to his Excellency Sardar Ahmad Ali Khan, who has been absent on leave since April 1938. 8. Italian Interests. The Italian Government have now decided to send, in addition to their official representative and suite, a naval detachment consisting of four officers and sixty ratings to attend the wedding celebrations. The detachment will be furnished by the Eritrea, which is scheduled to arrive at Bandar Shahpur on the 18th April. It will be recalled that this vessel visited Khorramshahr and Basra from the 2nd to the 7th March last year. 9. Civil A viation. \ On the 20th March the weekly Iranian air mail and passenger aeroplane for Bagdad crashed shortly after taking off. The machine was completely wrecked3 and was burnt out. The crew and passengers, among whom were Major the Lord Stratheden, Coldstream Guards, and Lady Stratheden, escaped with bruises and severe shock. This is the first serious accident to the Iranian air mail service since its inauguration at the end of November 1937. The pilot, Sarwan (Captain) Mustafavi, who received his training in Europe, had never before flown a fully- loaded D.H. ££ Rapide.” It appears that, shortly after taking off, the pilot attempted to climb too rapidly, with the result that the plane stalled and crashed. The crash occurred within a few yards of a Lufthansa machine, which was also ready to take off for Berlin. No mention of this accident has appeared in the press. 10. Communications. (i) Roads .—The bringing into operation of the transport arrangements between Trebizond and Tabriz has been suspended by the Turkish Government until the end of June. According to information obtained from a Turkish source, the road is impassable owing to heavy snow and landslides. It is learned from a reliable source that the Iranian Government do not now wish to continue the promotion of this trade route. (ii) Telegra'phic .—A telegraphic and wireless telegraphic agreement was signed in Kabul on the 7th January between representatives of Iran and Afghanistan. This agreement provides for the establishment of direct telegraphic communication between the two countries. Overland telegraph offices will be established at the under-mentioned places :— In Iran: Tayyebat (presumably Taiabad), million sheet No. 29. sq. N. In Afghanistan: Islam Kala, million sheet No. 29, sq. O. Radio telegraph offices already exist in the capitals of both countries. (iii) Railways .—Work on all'branch lines of the Trans-Iranian Railway is continuing at full pressure now that the weather is good. The station buildings, both at Qashan and Yezd, have been begun. 11. German Interests. On the 21st March the German Military Attache called on the British Military Attache officially. In the course of conversation he stated that all out standing Iranian contracts for armaments placed with Messrs. Skoda and Brno of Czecho-Slovakia would be fulfilled. He went on to say that these firms had been practically administered by Germany since October last, when the French interests were taken over by Messrs. Krupp. 12. The Imperial Bank of Iran. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), paragraph 13. Ihe closing- down of the branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran at Aezd appeals to have caused a poor impression among the merchants of that town, who were much in favour of it being kept open. The branch was suddenly closed down within the short period ot six weeks, and no reasons were given to its clients. As a result of the closing down of the branches also at Kerman and Zahidan the Imperial Bank of Iran has now completely severed its long connexion with South-East Iran. 13. Provinces. It is reliably reported from Yezd that over 283 silk weavers have been forcibly removed from their homes and sent under escort to work in the Shah’s silk factory in Mazanderan. 14. German Clearing A greement. After prolonged negotiations the German Clearing Agreement has been renewed for a further period of one year. Under the old agreement there resulted an adverse balance amounting to nearly 27 million reichsmarks in favour of Germany. In November 1938 the Shah decided to denounce the agreement unless the Germans accepted certain modifica tions, which included the payment in sterling of the adverse balance, the reichs mark to be calculated at 32 to the £ steiling.4 4 The Germans finally accepted the Shah’s proposals, and a supplement to the Iran-German Clearing Agreement was signed in January 1939. This supplement provides for only one clearing account at the German Clearing Office. The Banque-i-Mellie of Iran will deposit rials only. Payments will be effected chronologically as they were made or fall due. The rate of the clearing reichsmark will he fixed by both countries in consultation. Merchandise must not be transported through the U.S.S.R., but must either be sent via Trebizond, which is expensive, or by sea route to Bandar Shahpur. 15. British Broadcasts. At 20.50 hours on Saturday, the 18th March, a broadcast talk in Persian from London by Sir Dennison Ross and the Charge d'Affaires of Iran had been advertised in the press. Actually, listeners heard Sir Dennison Ross speak a few sentences in Arabic and then in Persian expressing his greetings and congratulations to Egypt and Iran on the wedding of their Royal Houses. This was followed by a talk in Arabic on Iran and Egypt by the regular Arabic announcer. The reception in Tehran (short wave 31-32 metres) was excellent, but as a Persian broadcast it was a distinct disappointment. On the other hand, on Thursday, the 16th March, at 22.15 hours, under the “ Food for Thought ' series, an accuiate, interesting and appreciated talk was given by Mr. S. Clegg, late of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, on Iran (its size, climate, peoples, progress, industries and its ruler). H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache. Tehran, March 25. 1939.I THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Persia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 3024/216/34] April 25, 1939. Section^. -i 4 ( ) Copy No. * Mr. Seymour to Viscount Halifax.—(Received April 25.) (No. 108.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 7 for the period ending the 8th April, 1939. compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, April 14, 1939. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 7 for the Period ending April 8, 1939. (Secret.) 1. The Crown Prince. AFTER a stay of nearly one month His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, accompanied by his wife, the Crown Princess Fouzieh, Her Majesty Queen Nazli, the Queen-mother, the Princesses Fateh. Faiqeh. Faezeh and a targe suite, embarked at Port Said on the 4th April for Bandar Shahpur via the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf on the steamship Mohamed Ali-el-Kehir of the Pharaonic Line. An Egyptian naval escort is accompanying the Mohamed Ali-el-Kehir as far as 18° of latitude, where the escort duty will be taken over by the Royal Italian navy, followed by the French, British and Iranian navies each in their respective waters. It is reliably reported that there is little enthusiasm in Egypt for this alliance of the ruling houses of Iran and Egypt. Official Egyptian circles deplore the waste of time and lavish expenditure which has been incurred in Egypt on the marriage ceremonies and entertainment of His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince of Iran, especially during a time of acute world tension and anxiety. It has been noted that in comparison the marriage celebrations in Iran are to last four days. 2. Marriage Celebrations. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 6 (current), paragraph 8. The Italian Government have unexpectedly cancelled their decision to send a naval detachment to attend the wedding celebrations. No reasons have been given. (ii) The French delegation will be composed of the following : — General Weygand. M. M. Pelisser. M. Becq de Eouqiueres. Rear-Admiral de Carpentier. Professor Massignon. Captain Gasser, A.D.C. A detachment of three officers and fifty naval ratings. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), paragraph 3. Vice- Admiral J. F. Somerville. C.B., D.S.O., Commander-in-chief, East Indies Squadron, will not now attend the wedding celebrations in Tehran as he has been invalided home. His place will be taken by Commodore A. Poland. D.S.O.. former Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. [580 bb—2]9 (iv) The Earl of Athlone, K.G., and Princess Alice Countess of Athlone and suite, accompanied by Commodore Poland and staff, will travel by air from Bagdad to Tehran via Kermanshah. Five Vickers “ Valentia machines are being used for this purpose. (v) An Egyptian military contingent consisting of 250 all ranks embarked at Suez on the 29th March for Bandar Shahpur via the Red Sea. 3. Iranian Officials. Dr. Abdul Qasim Bahraini has been appointed Director of the Public Health Department. 4. The Iranian A rmy. (i) In accordance with the new Iranian Conscription Law, conscripts of Class 1298 (1919) have been called up for military service. They will commence their training from the end of Farvardin (the 21st April). (ii) It is reported that the Soviet Government, through their charge d’affaires, have recently informed the Imperial Iranian Government that they will not look with favour upon the suggested employment of a German military mission in Iran. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 of 1938, paragraph 6 (v). It is learned from two reliable sources that the order for 200,000 rifles from Brno of Czecho-Slovakia has been cancelled by the Iranian Government and given to the Fabrique nationale beige. 5. Tribal Unrest. Since the middle of February Kurdish tribes in the Sardasht area (degree sheet No. 1 H, square B 4) have been in a disturbed state. The cause of the rising is said to be due to the refusal of Kurdish conscripts to report for military service, disarmament and the compulsory adoption of European clothes. Several Iranian frontier posts have been attacked and the garrison at Sardasht (consisting of one battalion) has been threatened. The tribes have been joined by a number of their kinsfolk from Iraq, notably the Pizhder area. Military operations have up till now been considerably hampered and delayed by snow and bad weather. The General Officer Commanding 4th (Rezaieh) Division has, however, reinforced by motor lorry the Sardasht garrison with troops from Rezaieh and Sauj Bulagh. Additional troops have also been drafted into the disturbed area from the 5th (Senneh) Divisional Area and Tabriz. One punitive column is reported to have burnt the Kurdish village of Kolkerash (degree sheet No. 1 H, square B 4), not, however, without casualties. It is possible that numbers of Kurdish tribesmen are waiting to see whether an initial success attends this rising before taking an active part in it. The Iranian authorities, who are extremely reticent about the whole affair, blame agitatois fiom Iraq for stirring up the tribes. The situation is now reported to be well in hand. 6. Dutch Interests. A Dutch company called the Algemeene Exploratie Maatschappii of The Hague has been gi anted a concession to explore for minerals, excludin 0- oil and red oxide. Two areas have been defined. The northern area is a rectangle drawn approximately between the following place names :— Duz Duzan : Million sheet No. 1, square D 3. Kuraim : Million sheet No. 8, square A 3. Nain : Million sheet No. 16, square B 4. Khumain : Million sheet No. 9, square C 3. The southern area is formed approximately by joining the following places:— * o Pashu : Million sheet No. 24, square C 3. Kuh-i-Basud : Million sheet No. 25. square C 2. Siri Island : Million sheet No. 18, square C 3. Bum : Million sheet No. 17. square C 3. this concession area includes all islands belonging to Iran within these limits. The ownership, however, of several of these islands is under dispute /iz., Tamb, Bumusa, &amp;c., which may raise difficulties3 I he exploration company has agreed to spend half a million florins (£55,000), spread over a period of three years, as under :— Florins. First year ... ... ... ... ... 100,000 Second year ... ... ... ... ... 200,000 Third year ... ... ... ... ... 200.000 These sums of money have to be deposited with the Banque-i-Mellie at the beginning of each year. The text of the concession has been carefully drawn up on the lines of the contract between the defunct Amiranian Oil Company and the Iranian Government. A rough sketch map of the concession areas is attached as an appendix^) to this summary for ready reference. 7. French Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 5 (current), paragraph 6. The French Government, through its minister in Iran, have strongly protested against the continued detention in prison without trial of M. Mathis, chief representative of Messrs. Schneiders, Creuzot, &amp;c., in Iran. 8. Italian Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), paragraph 11. Colonel Bolioni, the Italian Military Attache at Angora, has been accredited also to Tehran. He is expected to attend the forthcoming wedding celebrations in the capital. 9. Afghanistan Interests. A treaty was signed at Kabul on the 26th January between Afghanistan and Iran on the subject of their respective water rights on the Helmand River at the Kamal Khan barrage. According to the terms of the treaty, the two parties agree equally to divide the waters of the Helmand from the barrage area annually during the autumn. The cost of constructing sluices, additional canals, &amp;c., will be divided between the two countries. 10. Civil Aviation. (i) Polish Airlines (L.O.T.) are starting a new air bi-weekly service between London and Bagdad via Athens, Beirut and Lydda. Negotiations are reported to be taking place for its possible extension to Tehran. The aircraft to be used is the Lockhead type 14. The scheduled time for the flight is thirty hours. (ii) The type of aircraft used on the Berlin-Tehran-Kabul passenger air service is the Junkers Ju. 52/3M Transport Monoplane (three B.M.W. 132 engines). 11. The Majlis.

Foreign Office Personalities No. 73) was again re-elected president. Murteza Quli Bayat (Saham-es-Sultan) (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 65, Foreign Office Personalities No. 50) and Dr. Taheri were re-elected vice-presidents. 12. The Imperial Bank of Iran.

Tehran, A pril 29, 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary \o. 8 for the Period ending April 22, 1939. 1. The Crown Prince. REFERENCE Intelligence Summary No. 7 (current), paragraph 1. H.M.S. Norfolk took over escort duty from the French navy in the Bab-el-Mandeb and accompanied the steamship Mohamed Ali El Kehir, conveying their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Prince and Princess of Iran, their guests and suites, as far as the entrance to the Persian Gulf, where the Imperial Iranian Navy sloops Barr and Palang took over. During their voyage their Imperial Highnesses, together with Her Royal Highness Queen Nazfi of Egypt, boarded H.M.S. Norfolk and walked round ship. They appeared to be very interested in all they were shown. The Crown Prince showed himself to be particularly well informed on naval subjects. On the 14th April the steamship Mohamed Ali El Kehir arrived at Bandar Shahpur. Her Imperial Majesty the Queen, accompanied by the two Iranian Princesses and the General Officer Commanding 6th (Khuzistan) Division, immediately embarked and greeted the Royal party, after which all entrained for Tehran. On the 15th April at 15 hours the Royal train reached Tehran and was met at the station by His Imperial Majesty the Shah. A procession, consisting of a Sovereign's escort of cavalry furnished by the 1st Pahlavi Lancers followed by twenty-two open cars, was then formed. The procession drove slowly through the decorated streets to the Gulistan Palace. Although the day was not an official holiday the crowd which had assembled some hours beforehand were two to three deep. As the procession passed the crowd clapped loudly and appeared to be genuinely curious to see the Crown Prince and Princess. The unusual placing of the occupants of the first carriages was, however, somewhat confusing :— (1) His Imperial Majesty the Shah and Her Royal Highness Queen Nazli. (2) Her Imperial Majesty the Queen and Her Imperial Highness Princess Fowzieh. (3) His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince and Her Royal Highness Princess Faezeh. 2. The Marriage Celebrations. (i) On the 17th April, at the special invitation of the Minister of War, all foreign military attaches and Lieutenant-Commander F. R. W. Paris, R.N., w T ere shown the accommodation and arrangements at the Officers' Club and Ecole de Guerre for the officers and men of their respective detachments. It was evident that no pains or expense had been spared to make the foreign detachments comfortable during their stay in Tehran. [605 i—5](ii) On the 16th April a special Afghan mission, composed as under, arrived by train from Kabul, via Karachi and Bandar Shahpur :— His Excellency Ahmed Shah Khan, Minister of the Afghan Court. Divisional General Mustafa Khan, acting Chief of the General Staff. Brigadier Mohammad Yakub Khan, A.D.C. I (iii) The Earl of Athlone, K.G., and Her Royal Highness Princess Alice Countess of Athlone and suite, accompanied by Commodore Poland and staff, arrived at Doshan Tappeh military aerodrome on the 19th April. They had flown from Bagdad, via Kermanshah, in five Vickers “Valentia ' machines. On arrival they were officially welcomed by His Imperial Highness Prince Shahpur Ali Reza Pahlevi (Military Attache's Personalities, No. 206, page 3) and a guard of honour (with band), furnished by the 5th (Rezapur) Infantry Regiment. (iv) The Royal Naval detachment, under the command of Lieutenant-Com mander M. G. Goodenough, R.N., arrived in Tehran on the afternoon of the 20th April. Arrangements for the comfort of the officers and men during the train journey of thirty-one hours were excellent. The detachment was officially greeted by Colonel (Sarhang) Hasan Arfa (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 37), representing the Imperial Iranian army, and a guard of honour (with band), furnished by the 1st (Pahlavi) Guard Regiment. The Royal Naval detachment, headed by a Royal Marine band, marched from the station to the officers’ training college (1J miles) through crowded streets. An extraordinarily warm welcome was accorded them by the Persian crowds at the station and during the march. (v) On the 21st April a garden party was given by His Majesty’s Minister and Mrs. Seymour to the British colony, to have the honour to meet Major- General the Earl of Athlone, K.G., and Her Royal Highness Princess Alice Countess of Athlone in the grounds of the legation. The Iranian military authorities issued strict orders that no member of the British detachment was to enter the British Legation. It was only after the greatest difficulty that the order was cancelled. On the following day the military authorities apologised for the trouble caused, but no explanation was forthcoming. It is believed that the whole incident arose over a misinterpretation of a remark by the Shah that he wished all foreign detachments to be his guests. (vi) On the 22nd April heads of special missions and the Diplomatic Corps w^ere introduced to Her Majesty Queen Nazli at the Gulistan Palace and to view the presents. Her Imperial Highness the Crown Princess Fowzieh was prevented from attending through indisposition. (vii) No special mission has come from India to be present at the celebra tions. Since India is a neighbouring country, this has caused some surprise and comment. (viii) The following naval and military detachments have now arrived in Tehran :— France— Naval ratings : 50. From Beirut by road. England— Naval ratings : 59. | Fr ° m '. 'P Norfolk, East Indies Squadron, Royal Marine band : 22. j rai ^ rom Bandar Shahpur. U.S.S.R.— Naval ratings : 33. By road from Bandar Pahlavi. Turkey— Officers : 10. 5 Other ranks : 158. &gt; By road. Band : 48. ) Egypt— Officers : 11. I Guard cavalry and band : 84. f By rail from Bandar Shahpur. Soldiers : 106. )j ft 3 (ix) One hundred and twenty-three triumphal arches have been erected in Tehran along the processional route. The estimated cost of these and other decorations, which are most elaborate, is about £100,000. ( 3. Polish Interests. The President of the Polish Republic has presented an aeroplane to His imperial Highness the Crown Prince. This machine was flown from Poland, and is similar to the type R.W.D. 10 shown in Jane's all the World's Aircraft, p. 226 (c). 4. Japanese Interests. The Japanese special mission for the marriage celebrations, consisting of the following members, arrived at Doshan Tappeh military aerodrome on the 15th April by air :— Commander Hozumi Eguchi, Japanese navy. Mr. Takco, chief of the Foreign Air Communications Committee. Mr. Sahiro, general manager of the Japanese air line “Dai Nippo Kokukai.” The crew of the machine consisted of two pilots, two mechanics and one wireless operator. The aircraft used is named the “ Soyokazi,” a product of the Mitsubishi Company—twin-engined (vide Jane's all the World's Aircraft, 1938, p. 197 (c). The machine is reported to have been used previously in Japanese military operations in China and hit on two occasions. The journey from Japan was compeleted in seven days as follows :— April 9, Tokyo-Taihoku (Formosa) : 2,140 kilom. April 10, Taihoku-Canton : 930 kilom. April 11, Canton-Rangkok : 2,020 kilom. April 12, Bangkok-Calcutta : 1,680 kilom. April 13, Calcutta-Karachi: 2,445 kilom. April 14, Karachi-Basra : 2.150 kilom. April 15, Basra- Tehran (via Bagdad (five hours)) : 1,140 kilom This machine has flown over Tehran several times daily during its stay and has showered leaflets congratulating Iran on the wedding. 5. Egyptian Interests. On the 18th April His Imperial Majesty the Shah received in audience his Excellency Yussuf Zulfikar Pasha, the new Egyptian Ambassador, who presented his letters of credence. His Excellency is the father of the present Queen of Egypt and is therefore closely connected with Egyptian Court circles. 6. A fghan Interests. His Excellency Mohammad Nouroz Khan, the new Afghan Ambassador, presented his letters of credence on the 18th April. 7. Turkish Interests.

A report from Ahwaz states that considerable interest has been taken in the recent broadcasts in Persian from Cairo and London Many local Arab- speaking Persian notables listen to the daily news m Arabic, and have them selves suggested similar broadcasts in the Persian language. It is also reported from Shiraz and other sources that a free distribution of the German-Asia-Australian broadcasting programmes is made. I his programme is stated to be much better than the British Broadcasting Corpora tion s overseas press bulletin, being clearer, more businesslike and easier to understand. 13. The Iranian Air Force.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 9 for the period ending the 6th May, 1939, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, May 11, 1939. /o x Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 9 for the Period ending May 6, 1939. 1. The Shah. ON the 27th April His Imperial Majesty the Shah formally opened the Fifth Annual Exhibition of Iranian trade goods in Tehran. The Shah visited every stall and asked many questions about the exhibits. He exhorted exhibitors to still further better their wares with a view to possible exportation. On the 3rd May the Shah left by Royal train for a tour in Mazanderan Province. 2. The Crown Prince and Royal Family. (i) His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince and Her Imperial Highness the Crown Princess, accompanied by Her Royal Highness Queen Nazli and the young Egyptian Princesses, left Tehran on the 29th April by car for a holiday in Mazanderan and Gilan. They returned to Tehran on the 4th May. (ii) Prince Shahpur Ali Reza Pahlavi met with a serious motor accident in Tehran on the 5th May. 3. The Marriage Ceremonies. (i) Her Royal Highness Queen Nazli and the Egyptian Princesses left Tehran for Bandar Shahpur on the 6th May, where they will embark on the steamship Mohamed Ali-el-Kehir and return to Egypt by sea. (ii) All foreign naval and military detachments as well as most of the special delegations have now left Iran. (iii) The Earl of Athlone, K.G., and Her Royal Highness Princess Alice Countess of Athlone, after visiting the Caspian seaboard by motor car, proceeded to Persepolis by air (Valentia), landing at Isfahan en route. They returned to Tehran by road and left on the 6th May for Kermanshah, where they will be flown to Bagdad in Royal Air Force machines. (iv) Notes on the marriage celebrations are annexed as an appendix to this intelligence summary. 4. Iranian Officials. (i) Sarhang (Colonel) Rahsar Sarlari, formerly director of the Secret Police, has been appointed general manager of the Iranian State Railways. (ii) Husain Samiyi (Abid-us-Saltanehl (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 254, Foreign Office Personalities, No. 181), who was appointed Grand Master of Ceremonies at the Court in 1934, has been dismissed. (iii) Husein Quli Qaragozlu (Amir Nizam) (Foreign Office Personalities, No. 147), who was appointed Grand Master of Court Ceremonies (Foreign) in 1938, has been dismissed. [605 z—1] B5. The Iranian A rmy. It is reported from a reliable Czech source that the Iranian army authorities are carrying out trials with a new type of armoured vehicle called the R.y. huilt by the Czecho-Moravska Company. Details of this vehicle are lacking, but it is reported as having a cross-country speed of 70 kilom. per hour. Twenty of this type of car have been ordered and will be delivered within the next two or three months. 6. French Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 7 (current), paragraph 7. After three months’ imprisonment M. Mathis has been released. It is reported that General Weygand during his audience with His Imperial Majesty the Shah asked for his pardon. M. Mathis states that he was well treated in prison and has no complaint to make against the Iranian authorities. He expects to return to France shortly. 7. German Interests. Dr. Franz F. Schmidt-Dumont, German press attache, gave a luncheon party on the 27th April to representatives of the Iranian press and to foreign journalists and press photographers present in Tehran for the wedding celebrations. It is interesting to note that the German press was represented by five prominent newspapers and news agencies. 8. The Saculabad Pact. On the 28th and 29th April representatives of the four signatory Powers met in Tehran under the chairmanship of Mr. Alam, Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the third general meeting. A communique was issued after the meetings, which stated that, among other subjects, the present international situation had been fully examined and that there was unanimity of view among the delegations. The next meeting will take place at Kabul. The chief representatives were as follows : — Iran— Mr. Muzaffar Alam : Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Bagher Kazemi : Iranian Ambassador at Kabul. Dr. Javad Ameri : Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Turkey— M. Rana Tarhan : Minister of Customs and Monopolies. M. Enis Akaygan : Turkish Ambassador at Tehran. Afghanistan— Sirdar Ali Mohammad Khan : Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. Mohammad Noruz Khan : Afghan Ambassador at Tehran. Iraq— Rashid Khodja : Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. 9. Turkish Interests. The seven “ Vultee” aircraft of the Turkish air force which had participated at the Royal wedding celebrations met with disaster after leaving Tehran on the 28th April on their homeward journey. The return flight to Turkey had been delayed since the 26th April on account of adverse weather reports. Despite advice to the contrary, which the Iranian air force state they gave, the Turkish aircraft took off. In the vicinity of Tabriz they met a violent storm with thick mist. One of the machines managed to reach Diarbekr (Turkey). One made a forced landing at Namin (degree sheet No. 8 B, square B 3), and two other machines at Tabriz. One machine returned to Tehran and the remaining two crashed at Kangarlou and Meskhin (Khiav) (degree sheet No. 1 N, square C 3). The pilots of both these machines were killed, the remaining occupants being injured.3 There are no regular weather reports or meteorological stations or staffs in Iran. 10. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Within the past week the Iranian press have commenced a strong campaign against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, accusing them of a breach of contract by curtailing production to the detriment of national economy. They also insinuate that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were responsible by underhand means for the Amiranian Oil Company surrendering its rich concessions in East Iran. It is suggested that unless the company increase production at once a denunciation of the company’s contract should be made. The press campaign continues. There is no doubt that these articles are officially inspired. For some time past it had been known that foreign currency is most urgently required both on account of the Egyptian marriage, increased expenditure on armaments, railway extensions and other ambitious commercial enterprises. It is quite true that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have slowed down their expansion programme. The new pipe-line from Gach Saran to Abadan which was to have been completed in 1940 is now scheduled for 1942. On the other hand, the company are negotiating for a site near Bandar Mashur (degree sheet No. 10 F, square A 2), vide Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 5, for a new refinery, &amp;c. It is quite useless pointing out to the Iranians that output has to be curtailed temporarily owing to a decrease in world demand; the boom ! caused by many countries laying in large reserves of oil against a war having || apparently slackened. 11. British Officers. Lieutenant G. D. Phillips, 3rd Battalion the Baluch Regiment (Q.M.O.), arrived in Tehran on the 4th May from India. 12. Taking of Cinematograph Pictures and Photographs, &amp;c. Regulations concerning the taking of cinematograph pictures and photo graphs, painting and sketching are annexed as appendix Ilf 1 ) to this intelligence summary. * Tehran, May 6, 1939. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache. Appendix. Notes on the Marriage Celebrations. (Reference: Appendix “ A ” to Intelligence Summary No. 2 of 1939.) THE programme published in the above-quoted intelligence summary was carried out without change. No useful comment can be made on the dinners and soirees, except that owing to inexperience and incompetence in placing the guests the dinners were always late. Added to which was the painfully slow service (Iranians do not make good waiters). The result of these late starts was that guests invited to a soiree commencing at 10 p.m. had invariably to stand about from one and a half to one and three-quarter hours without music or entertain ment before the dinner guests arrived. When the Royal party entered the guest-chambers they passed in procession between rows of guests without a word of greeting or friendly gesture, with the possible exception of Queen Nazli and the Crown Princess Fowzieh. On the final night of the celebrations (25th April) the Crown Prince and Princess left the Gulistan Palace shortly after midnight and drove through the crowded streets in a floral decorated car to the Marble Palace, the gift of the Shah to the Royal couple. The streets were lined with the troops of the Tehran Garrison, who had also paraded for the Royal Review that afternoon, which alone lasted nearly eight hours. b 2 [605 z—1] ( J ) Not printed.General. 1. The procession of the Crown Prince and Princess from the station to the Gulistan Palace was remarkable for two things : firstly, that open cars were used and, secondly, that the streets were not lined with troops, only one policeman being posted every twenty yards on both sides of the route. The cavalry escort rode at the trot about 100 yards in front of the leading car (that ot the bhah). Thus there was no guard whatsoever for the Royal party, who were defenceless against a sudden attack. On the final evening of the celebrations the streets were lined by the whole of the Tehran Garrison. Owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding the order to close was given before the Shah’s car had actually passed, the result was that the crowd swarmed into the streets and the Royal car had considerable difficulty in getting through. The Shah himself, however, stood up in his car and gave orders in no uncertain voice. The situation was restored immediately. 2. It is reliably reported that Her Royal Highness Queen Nazli and the Egyptians are very dissatisfied with the arrangements made for their comfort and with Iran and the Iranians. Unfortunately, they have been too outspoken on this subject. It is rumoured that Queen Nazli and the young Princesses will shortly return to Egypt instead of remaining in Iran the whole summer as originally planned. 3. Her Royal Highness Princess Alice Countess of Athlone and the Earl of Athlone, K.G., and His Royal Highness the Due de Spoleto impressed all by their friendly, sympathetic and gracious attitude. General Weygand, too, was an outstanding figure, looking every inch a soldier in spite of his /2 years of age. The large German and Italian delegations were conspicuous by their variety of uniforms. It was noted that they fraternised considerably. Hitherto neither the German nor Italian missions in Tehran have ever displayed a great liking for one another. 4. The Iranian officers of the Officers’ Training College are loud in their praises of the discipline and friendliness of the Royal Naval and Royal Air Force detachments. The visit of the British detachment has undoubtedly created an excellent impression. 5. His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince wore the same type of uniform at all entertainments. His general air of aloofness, solemnity and dignity did not contribute much to his popularity. On the other hand, Her Imperial Highness the Crown Princess Fowzieh made an excellent impression by her charm and good looks. April 25, 1939 : The Royal Review. This special military review was held on the grounds of the Jalalieh Race- Course. The small diplomatic stand and enclosure was grossly overcrowded as no provision had been made for extra or reserved seats for the members of the special foreign delegations, many having to stand for over six hours. The three large public stands were filled with specially invited guests, but were not overcrowded. The general public was kept back by the police at a considerable distance on the edges of the area and consequently could see very little. His Imperial Majesty the Shah and His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince arrived late. Both mounted and rode round the front ranks of the foreign naval and military detachments and the Tehran Garrison. On their return to the Royal Pavilion a display of trick horsemanship was given by 100 men of the 3rd (Hamleh) Regiment of Cavalry. Then followed a drive at the canter by a Horse Artillery Regiment. The 2nd (Fateh) Regiment of Cavalry then advanced in mass and halted in front of the Royal Pavilion. The Regimental Commandant dismounted and carrying a new colour advanced to the Royal Pavilion, where he was signalled by the Shah to proceed to the Royal Ladies’ Tent to the left of the pavilion. There Her Imperial Highness Princess Fowzieh affixed her personal emblem to the colour and returned it to the regiment, which now bears her name. It was a great pity that this event was not carried out in full view of the general public or even the regiment itself. As a ceremony the whole affair was without interest. After this the Iranian air force flew past in the following order : The visiting Japanese and Italian aircraft headed by a “ Fury ” machine of the Iranian air force. Seven “ Vultee ” aircraft of the Turkish air force. Seventy-seven aero-5 r r y r r planes of the Iranian air force in flights of seven. To finish, a flight of “ Fury aircraft gave an exhibition of aerobatics, which mainly consisted of loops in line ahead and rolls. The march past of the foreign naval and military detachments then commenced in the following order : — Egyptians. French. British. Turks. Soviet. A detachment of the Egyptian Household Cavalry headed by their band on foot. The Egyptian infantry in thick khaki in column of route. Their drill was indifferent, although the men were a tall, soldierly-looking lot. The Turks, in grey uniform with French pattern steel helmets headed by their band, marched past in line with their rifles at the sling position. They appeared a sturdy, tough, compact body of men. The French naval detachment in fours. The British naval detachment in line headed by their Royal Marine band. The step was somewhat slow, but the drill and alignment perfect. Last was a small body of Soviet sailors dressed in white unform, carrying their rifles at the “ On Guard ” position. They were all young men of good physique. Next to the British detachment they were very smart indeed. After passing the saluting base the foreign detachments wheeled and remained standing, at ease, throughout the remainder of the afternoon (four and a half hours), facing the advancing troops of the Tehran Garrison. Originally it had been intended that the foreign detachments should form up again facing the Royal Pavilion and stand at “attention” during the march past of the Tehran Garrison. With one accord the officers commanding detachments refused to do this and insisted on returning to barracks after marching past. A com promise on the above lines was, however, arranged at the eleventh hour. The Tehran Garrison then marched past exactly as was done on the 22nd February, already reported. The lines and marching were even better than before. Altogether about 28,000 troops were on parade. Irania/n Officers' Club. Accommodation and meals for all naval and military officers of the foreign detachments were arranged at the Officers’ Club, with the exception of the Japanese, Italians and Germans, who were accommodated in their respective legations The Officers Glub is a magnificent modern building, four stories high situated in the centre of Tehran. It is fully furnished and is equipped with lifts and modern plumbing. There are several large dining-rooms, a large cocktail bar, a Royal suite reserved for the Shah and Crown Prince and suites of rooms for about thirty living-in officers. Outside there is a well-laid-out floral warden with four hard tennis-courts. Two villas to the light and left of the main entrance gate are in the course of construction as annexes. It is considered extremely doubtful whether Iranian officers will use this club tegulailv, if at all. No foreign military attaches have as yet been invited to become honorary 1116 The following British naval and air force officers were accommodated in the Commodore A. Poland, R.N. Paymaster-Commander A. W. Laybourne, R.N. Lieutenant-Commander F. R. W. Parish, R.N. Lieutenant-Commander M. G. Goodenough, R.N. Lieutenant D. F. Townsend, R.N. Surgeon-Lieutenant R. T. May. Wing Commander J. W. F. Merer, R.A.F. Squadron-Leader J. G. Elton, R.A.F. Pilot-Officer B. N. Wigginton, R.A.F. Pilot-Officer Garrard-Cole, R.A.F. Pilot-Office Barnard, R.A.F.7 The Crown Prince and Princess arrived forty-five minutes late in a Bugatti two-seater sports-model driven by the former. The Crown Prince was still attired in the same type of uniform that he has continuously worn since he left for Egypt. After inspecting the guard of honour, the Crown Prince sat down in the private gardens of the British Minister and talked mostly with Lord Athlone _ and the Duke of Spoleto for about an hour. This is the first occasion on which His Imperial Highness has ever visited the British Legation. It was noted that all Iranian Ministers and other officials invited also received the Crown Prince and Princess at the main entrance and escorted them into the garden, although they, too, were only guests.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Persia).

All the principal towns were visited. At Bandar Pahlavi their Imperial Highnesses embarked on the Royal yacht Shahsawar and cruised along the Caspian shore to the port of Nau Shahr (degree sheet No. 8 P, square C 2). where they disembarked and joined His Imperial Majesty the Shah. Meanwhile, the Queen and the Iranian princesses, forming a third and independent Royal party, were also touring in Gilan. Their Imperial Highnesses continued their tour into Mazanderan Province, visiting Amul, Shahi, Sari, Behshahr, &amp;c., returning to the capital via Firuzkuh road on the 16th May. A special visit was made to the hotel at Ab Ali (degree sheet No. 9 M, square D 1), which is noted for its mineral water springs. It is understood that this locality is to be developed. 3. The Majlis. The Minister of the Interior, Mr. Ali Ashgar Hikmat (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. Ill; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 99), has introduced a Bill into the Majlis amending and detailing the procedure to be adopted in the case of a new census. One of the articles lays down that on census day all persons will be compelled to remain in their houses for twenty-four hours. 4. The Trans-Iranian Railway. (i) Lot No. 1 of the Qum-Yezd branch line of the Trans-Iranian Railway has now been completed except for the bridge over the Qum Rud at Qum. The laying of the rails has already begun. (ii) Tenders have recently been invited for a further six locomotives. (iii) Nineteen foreign engineers, the majority of Swiss nationality, have recently been engaged by the Iranian Government for railway construction work. No Germans have been engaged. (iv) The bi-weekly passenger services on the northern and southern section of the Trans-Iranian Railway are entirely insufficient for the volume of traffic. The number of passenger trains is to be increased. [630 e—1]2 5. Aerodromes. (i) A consular report from Shiraz states that the Shiraz aerodrome has now been put into a serviceable condition. The surface is reported as being exce en , boundaries clearly marked and the air sleeve renewed. 1 he road leading tiom e town to the aerodrome has also been repaired. .. . , (ii) The emergency landing grounds at Qum and Dihjan have been repaired and re-marked. 6. Japanese Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 8 (current), paragraph 4. Mr. Sanjii Tsuroka, representative of the Japanese Foreign Office at the wedding celebiations of His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, visited Kabul by air, returning to Tehran on the 11th May. , , ™ p t The Japanese aeroplane Soyokazi left Tehran on the 14th May for Japan via Bagdad. The Japanese Foreign Office representative was the only passenger travelling besides the crew, the remainder of the delegation having departed for Europe. It is interesting to note that the Japanese delegation were about the tirst to arrive for the celebrations and the last to leave. There is a strong rumour that they have obtained certain flying concessions over Iranian territory. 7. The Anglo-Iranian OH Company. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 9 (current), paragraph 10. The press campaign against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has ceased as suddenly as it had begun. Negotiations for the proposed concessional area (vide Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 5) are for the time being at a standstill. Popular feeling in the country is against the company. 8. The Iranian Air Force. (i) It is reliably reported that the Iranian air force is to be reorganised into regiments of three squadrons each as follows :— 1st Regiment: Qila Murgha. 2nd Regiment: Tabriz. 3rd Regiment: Meshed. 4th Regiment: Ahwaz. 5th Regiment (cadre) : Doshantappeh. Flying school : Mehrabad. (ii) On the 17th May a “ Hind ” machine, landing indifferently, smashed its wings and undercarriage. The court of enquiry, which was presided over by the acting Minister of War, three generals, one test pilot and Mr. Knight, technical adviser, tried to blame the accident on the wrong assembling of a retaining bolt held by a split pin under the fuselage. Mr. Knight refused to agree and the court adjourned. 9. Turkish Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 9 (current), paragraph 9. Further details are now available of the unfortunate accident to the Turkish air squadron of “ Vultces ” returning to Turkey on the 28th April. The Turkish authorities admit that it was an error of judgment on the part of the officer commanding the squadron to have started from Tehran on the day in question. Meteorological reports from both Tabriz and Diarbekr stated that there was thick mist near Tabriz. In the two machines that crashed two mechanics were killed, the pilots and assistant pilots managing to jump clear, using their American-make parachutes. The mechanics were seated in the rear of the machines and presumably could not force open the side doors because of the air pressure. The interment of the two mechanics took place in the Turkish air force cemetery at Karakoshe, Turkey.3 10. Education. Six new primary schools are to be built in Tehran in the near future to cater for the needs of the growing population. 11. German Interests. Consular reports from Meshed and Zahidan state that several German nationals have visited Zahidan and Chahbar recently. They are also reported to have made enquiries about the North-Western Railway line and the number of British subjects in Zahidan, &amp;c. 12. Broadcasting.

At a recent meeting of the Broadcasting Sub-Committee of the General Council for the Enlightenment of Public Opinion, Mr. Bader, Minister of Finance (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 51, Foreign Office Personalities, No. 40) stated that three broadcasting stations were under construction in Tehran as under. (i) Medium-wave (335 metres) station, strength 2 kilowatts. This station would broadcast to Tehran and neighbourhood. (ii) Short-wave (48 and 62 metres) station, strength 2 kilowatts. This station would be used for broadcasting to the whole country. (iii) Short-wave (19-30 and 48 metres) station, strength 20 kilowatts. 1 his station was to be used for distant parts of Iran and foreign countries. In addition, there were under construction twelve medium-wave 100-kilowatt transmitters in specified towns throughout Iran. Although the two short-wave stations were sufficient for the country, the committee intended erecting anothei medium-wave station—strength 2 kilowatts—and 12 medium-wave transmitters m the provinces. p i rr i Programmes would be simultaneously broadcast from the three lehran stations.^ In the twelve towns with receiving stations the programmes would be rebroadcast on medium wave. Programmes will be carefully selected, and will in the main consist of news, music, talks on agriculture, hygiene, history and geography of Iran. The Tehran studio is nearing completion and is fully up to date. 13. Bulgarian Interests. The Bulgarian Government have opened a legation in Tehran. M.

Civil Aviation. A national flying club, with headquarters in Tehran, has been founded. Articles on this subject have been published in the press for some time past stating that His Imperial Majesty the Shah is very interested and wishes such clubs to be organised. The importance and necessity of flying clubs is stressed for building up a reserve of pilots and training the nation to become air-minded. The Iranian Ambassador to Turkey has recently been closely inspecting Turkish flying clubs. Gliding, parachute jumping and aerobatics have been demonstrated to him and a flight of aeroplanes piloted by Turkish women pilots under the command of Sabiban Gokcen, adopted daughter of the late Kemal Ataturk, also gave an exhibition of flying. A full report of this has appeared in the Iranian press. 5. The Majlis. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 10 (current), paragraph 3. The Census Amending Bill has passed its second reading.

There is no truth in a rumour which has been circulated in Tehran that orders have been issued for the mobilisation of the Iranian army. No special measures have been taken by the Iranian Government in this direction. A report that the retention with, or the return to, the colours of conscripts who have completed their recognised period of training is entirely lacking confirmation. 3. The Iranian Army. (i) A demonstration of anti-aircraft gunnery with live shell was given in the presence of His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Crown Prince during the afternoon of the 14th August in the vicinity of Tajrish (degree sheet No. 9 M, square 1 J).

Cholera Outbreak. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current), paragraph 13. A consular report states that the cholera epidemic appears to be under control and the isolation of the area by a military cordon to have succeeded in preventing its spread beyond Seistan. Approximately 350 deaths have taken place, but only three have been recorded in Zabul itself since the 15th July. Traffic throughout East Iran has been disorganised owing to the cholera scare and much unnecessary inconvenience has been caused to travellers. [705 n—2]2 6. Education. His Imperial Majesty the Shah has ordered the Acting Minister of Public Instruction to arrange for the immediate acquisition of all foreign-run educa tional establishments in Iran. As the result, however, of representations made^pr-^ by His Majesty’s Minister and the United States Charge d’Ahaires to the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the taking over of foreign schools has been prolongated until the 7th June, 1940. Colleges which are owned and partly staffed by foreigners include: — The Alborz College, Tehran (formerly the American College), which has approximately 600 pupils. The Stuart Memorial College (C.M.S.), Isfahan, which has approxi mately 400 pupils. The College Manoutchehri, Tehran (formerly the Joan of Arc College), which has approximately 1,000 pupils. Lycee Frangais, Tehran, which has approximately 200 pupils. All the above establishments conform to the curriculum laid down by the Ministry of Public Instruction. 7. The Anglo-Tmnian Oil Company. It is reported that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Tehran have been asked by the Ministry of Mines for the services of geologists for work in connexion with the further development of the coal-mines at Shamshak (million sheet No. 9, square D 1). 8. Credit Loan. It is reliably reported that negotiations are now in progress between the Iranian and British Governments for export credits amounting to £5 million. It is understood that part of this sum will be utilised for the purchase of war material, aircraft, &amp;c., and the remainder on railway material. 9. The Iranian Air Force. (i) On the 13th August a Hawker “ Fury ” aeroplane crashed at Dazasham a small village situated east of Tajrish (degree sheet No. 9 M, square 1 J). The sergeant pilot was killed and the machine totally wrecked. Just before the accident the pilot was seen doing aerobatics at a low altitude. His relatives reside at Tajrish. (ii) The amended distribution of He Havilland aircraft on the establishment of the Iranian air force on the 19th August was reported to be as under :— Mehrabad ... ... ... ... ... ... 51 Qila Murgha ... ... ... ... ... 13 Doshantappeh ... ... ... ... ... 11 Ahwaz ... ... ... ... ... ... 6 Tabriz ... ... ... ... ... ... 6 Meshed ... ... ... ... ... ... 6 The Order of Battle of the Iranian army, dated the 1st June, 1939, should be amended to read accordingly. 10. British Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 16 (current), paragraph 11. Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Underwood, military attache, left Tehran for India on the 20th August.

(ii) It is reported that the number of military posts on the Russian side of the frontier at Julfa have been increased from one in 6 to one in 3 kilom. 13. Yugoslav Interests. A press report states that M. Kozer, the new Yugoslav Charge d’Affaires, has arrived in Tehran. A. N. CUMBERBATCH, Commercial Secretary.7. German Interests. It is reported that all Germans of military age have received instructions from the German Legation to return to Germany for military service. They are to travel via the U.S.S.R. and Finland. Many Germans have openly declared that they have no intention of complying with the order. In view of the probable signing of the Soviet-Irano Clearing Agreement referred to in paragraph 3 of this summary, these instructions have been held in abeyance. From a reliable Iranian source it is estimated that the number of Germans resident in the capital is 3,000, a number of whom have recently arrived from Iraq. -uj'-rr (ii) It is reported by a M. Hansen (Norwegian), representative of the . African and Eastern Trading Company, Basra, at present in Tehran on business, \ that the German Government have offered to the Iranian Government five German merchant vessels interned in neutral Gulf ports. 8. The Kermanshah Petroleum Company. A report from Kermanshah states that increased precautions have been made for the patrolling of the refinery by police and military guards. No one is permitted to enter the refinery or bungalow area without a special pass. H. J. UNDERWOOD, L ieutenant-Colonel.

SINCE his return to the Imperial Palace in Tehran on the 10th September, His Imperial Majesty the Shah has had several important public engagements. On the 12th September (the anniversary of the Prophet) the Shah held his usual levee and took the opportunity to harangue the various delegations on their duties to preserve the neutrality and well-being of Iran during the war. On various dates, accompanied by His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, His Imperial Majesty formally opened the Tehran grain silos, the Tehran glass works and the Trans-Iranian Railway Hospital. From the 16th to the 19th September His Imperial Majesty, again accompanied by the Crown Prince, attended the annual manoeuvres of the 1st and 2nd Divisions at Kerej.

(iii) A Royal Air Force machine flying in formation to Karachi from Sharjah made a forced landing in Iranian territory at Gulag, 65 miles west of Chahbar. It appears that the aircraft had actually arrived at Karachi at an altitude of 10,000 feet, but lost its direction owing to heavy clouds. In spite of their rights as a neutral, the Imperial Iranian Government have not interned the crew, but gave instructions for them to leave Iran. The four members of the crew were taken off bv the B.I.S.N. Company’s steamer Barpeta for Muscat. [730 r—1]2 OQ (iv) Miss A. Lambton, daughter of the Hon. G. Lambton, has been appointed •press attache at His Majesty’s Legation. (v) Captain P. G. B.

(i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 16 (current), paragraph 9. The Egyptian mission headed by his Excellency Hassanein Pasha left for Egypt on the 11th September as secretly as it came. It is thought that the mission brought a friendly and personal letter to the Shah from King Farouk minimising the alleged Egyptian press attacks on Iran and inviting the Shah to make a State visit to Cairo. Conversations were also held on the subject of the Crown Princess’s dowry. (ii) His Excellency Yusaf Zulfikar Pasha, the Egyptian Ambassador and father of the Queen of Egypt, left Tehran for Cairo on the 23rd September. His departure has not been mentioned in the Iranian press. The ambassador stated that he had been recalled by King Farouk and that he himself would not return to Iran, for which he was profoundly thankful. The embassy will be in charge of a charge d’affaires. 5. U.S.S.R. Interests. (j) O n the 15th September a new Soviet Ambassador, his Excellency M. Filiminov, formerly Commissar of Railways, arrived in Tehran. He was accompanied by a staff, which included a first secretary, two second secretaries and two attaches.

Lanian students in Europe have been ordered to rendezvous in Switzer land, f rom whence they are to return to Iran via Istanbul. 8. The War. On the outbreak of war an official communique, signed by the Prime Minister was issued declaring the Imperial Iranian Government’s decision to remain neutral and to strictly guard its neutrality. This was closelv followed by a public notice issued by the Ministry of the Interior forbidding foreigners from conduct or speech prejudicial to Iran’s declared neutrality. Iianian subjects have been forbidden to discuss the war with foreigners The change in Russian policy has caused acute apprehension. Strenuous efforts are being made to renew the Irano-Soviet Trade Agreement and it is anticipated that some agreement between the two countries will be concluded shortly which may include Germany. The Irano-Soviet Caucasian frontier has been strongly reinforced by the 3rd and 4th Divisions and certain units from the 1st and 2nd Divisions' All Iraqi frontier posts have been reinforced. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s (South Iranian) oilfields area is being guarded by the Police Department against sabotage. 6 9. The Iranian A rmy. (i) I he annual manoeuvres of the 1st and 2nd Divisions (Tehran Garrison! was held at Kerej (million sheet No. 9, square Cl), about 40 kilom. west of Tehran from the 16th to the 19th September.

Lists of other subscribers appear daily, as well as the names and photographs of Iranian youths and ladies who desire to be trained as pilots. All officers of the Imperial army have been ordered to become members of the club. It is also reported that all school-children are being made to subscribe. Notices have appeared in the press calling for tenders for the supply of an unknown number of light aircraft fitted with dual control for the use of the club. The president of the Civil Aeronautical Society of Japan has telegraphed the good wishes of his society to the new flying club. 11. Cholera Outbreak. Reference Intelligence Summaries Nos. 14 and 15 (current), paragraphs 13 and 5 respectively. On the 24th August the Public Health Department published a communique stating that the Zabul area was completely free of cholera, there having been no cases between the 19th July and the 2nd August. Quarantine stations still exist at Zahidan and Tayiabad to deal with travellers entering Iran from India and Afghanistan respectively. The Mirjawa-Baluchistan route is, however, still closed to ordinary travellers entering Iran. The Health Department state that on the outbreak of cholera a cordon was immediately formed round the infected area and thirty qualified doctors and 200 medical students were drafted into the area, with very effective results. Compulsory inoculation was carried out in a very large area,' the vaccine being brought by car and aeroplane from Tehran. 12. The Trans-Iranian Railway.

Tehran. October 16, 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 20 [sic] for the Period ending October 7, 1939. 1. The Shah. ON the 25th September, 1939, His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, visited the officers’ school at Tehran for the “passing out” ceremony of the senior-term cadets. The Shah was received by the Commandant Sarlashgar (Major-General) N azdan Panah (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 301; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 212). In his report the commandant mentioned that although the school had no foreign military instructors the results were even better than in previous years. The Shah, before presenting the cadets with their commissions and prizes, gave a very brief address of congratulations and encouragement. 2. British Interests. Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Underwood, Military Attache, left Tehran for Bagdad on the 9th October to attend a special conference. 3. Broadcasting. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current), paragraph 8. It is reported that the date for the submission of tenders has been postponed and it is expected that, owing to the international situation, the quantities to be purchased will be much reduced. The transmitters under construction are to operate on one medium-wave length (335 • 2 metres) and on short waves principally on 30 • 99 and 48 • 47 metres, but thev will probably use various frequencies and not as previously stated. The medium-wave broadcast is intended to be used in connexion with the recently established Department for the Orientation of Public Opinion foi listeners within the country only, and the idea is to sell as many suitable small sets as possible in order to reach the maximum number of listeners. 4. Iranian Officials. On the 24th September, by order of the Shah, the two daughters of his Excellency Ibrahim Qawam (Qawan-ul-Mulk) (Military Attache s Personalities. No 231 •' Foreign Office Personalities, No. 167) were married respectively to Dr. Abul Qasim Nafisi, son of Dr. Moadeb (All Ashgar) Nafisi (Military Attache’s Personalities. No. 189; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 140), and to M. Assadullah Alam, son of Ibrahim Alam, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. 5. U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) On the 27th September his Excellency M. Filimenov, the new Soviet Ambassador, presented his letters of credence to His Imperial Majesty the Shah at the Gulistan Palace on the 27th September. [730 ee—1](ii) The Irano-Soviet Trade Agreement has not yet been signed.

(b) Claim of a “ special position ” in Azerbaijan and Gilan. (c) Withdrawal of Iranian troops being sent to the northern frontier. There is no doubt that the Iranian Government have for some time been very nervous of the future policy of the Soviet Government. (iii) There are strong rumours in Tehran of the concentration of Soviet troops on both the Irano-Caucasian frontier and the Irano-Soviet Turkistan border in the vicinity of Askabad. 6. German Interests. Reliable but unconfirmed reports state that the Lufthansa Airways will shortly recommence its air service to Tehran and Kabul via Russia. It is possible also that attempts may now be made to extend the service to the Far East. 7. Turkish Interests. The new Turkish Ambassador, his Excellency Suad Davaz, arrived in Tehran on the 4th October and presented his letters of credence to His Imperial Majesty the Shah at the Gulistan Palace on the 8th October. 8.

Tehran, November 1, 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 21 for the Period ending October 21, 1939. 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah remains in residence at the Imperial Palace. He is still as indefatigable as ever. 2. The Crown Prince. (i) Since his marriage to Her Imperial Highness Princess Fowzieh the Crown Prince appears to have somewhat lost the full confidence of his Imperial father. It is stated that the Shah does not take the same interest that he did in educating his eldest son in affairs of State. (ii) Except for two trips to the Caspian seaboard, neither of the Imperial couple have as yet toured in the provinces. Marriage has made no apparent difference to His Imperial Highness, who remains as aloof and indifferent as ever. 3. Iranian Officials. (i) His Excellency Baqir Kazemi (Muhazzib-ud-Dowleh) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 142, Foreign Office Personalities, No. 108), Iranian Ambassador at Kabul, has been transferred in the same capacity to Angora. (ii) His Excellency Ali Soheilly (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 283, Foreign Office Personalities, No. 200), Ustander of Kerman, has been appointed Iranian Ambassador at Kabul. 4. Dutch Interests. An unconfirmed, but reliable, report states that representatives of the K.L.M. Air Line are now in Tehran negotiating with the Imperial Government for an extension of the air line from Bagdad to Tehran. 5. British Interests. (i) Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Underwood, military attache, returned to Tehran from Bagdad on the 15th October. (ii) The British Indian merchants in Tehran now seriously intend to form a merchant’s association and club. This has been a long-felt want, but has never hitherto been agreed to because of the constant quarrelling among the Sikh merchants. 6. Turkish Interests. The Angora broadcasting station started broadcasts in the Persian language on the 9th October. These broadcasts are given twice a day, at 1430 hours and 2015 hours (Tehran time), on the 31-70 metre band. The material is mostly translations of Reuter’s and British French news. The Persian is correct and the reception excellent. [755 o—2]2 7. U.S.S.R. Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 20 (current), paragraph 5 (i) A few days after the new Soviet Ambassador, his Excellency Matvei Filimonov, had presented his credentials to His Imperial Majesty the Shah, the Soviet counsellor, Isaac Kartachov, disappeared. He is thought to have either been murdered or in hiding, so as to avoid returning to Russia. The incident, though sensational, is of no political importance. 8. Italian Interests. (i) Colonel Napoli, agent for Ali Litoria Air Lines, arrived in Tehran on the 14th October to negotiate for (i) an extension of the Ali Litoria Air Service to Tehran, and (ii) permission for the Ali Litoria Rangoon Far Eastern Service to use Task and Bushire airports. Colonel Napoli is doubtful whether the Imperial Government will agree to (i) above. (ii) The Italian Naval Attache has officially approached the Iranian Ministry of War offering to supply Italian service aircraft and other war material. The Italian Government are prepared to deliver the aircraft in Iran and, if necessary, place the services of a small number of aircraft specialists, &amp;c., at the disposal of the Iranian forces for a short period. Facilities for the training of Iranian personnel in Italy are also offered. It is reliably reported that the Italians have a large number of reconditioned aircraft for disposal in Abyssinia. 9. The Iranian Air Force. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 20 (current), paragraph 9. Mr. R. Rennell, the Hawker test pilot, flew the Hurricane single-seat fighter machine from Ahwaz to Tehran on the 18th October in one hour twelve minutes. The route taken was via Dizful. On the afternoon of the 19th October Mr. Rennell gave a demonstration of the machine at Qila Murgha aerodrome in the presence of His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince and Princess Fowzieh. High ranking Iranian air force officers present were enthusiastic, and expressed the hope that the remainder of the order (nineteen machines) would be delivered soon. (ii) An Iranian Air Force Mission, consisting of the following officers, will shortly leave Iran for the United States of America :— Lieutenant-Colonel Mahmud Khasrovani. Major Rahim Shaltshi. Captain Afkhami (crack pilot). 10. German Interests. (i) His Excellency Dr. Hans Smend, the German Minister, has been recalled to Berlin. His successor is stated to be Herr Fttel (or Ettler), a strong Nazi leader, at present in Rome. Herr Ettel has been in Iran before with Messrs. Junkers. It is possible that the Shah may refuse his agrement. (ii) The crews of the Hansa Line steamers are reported to be still at Bandar Shahpur. Difficulty is being experienced by Iraqi merchants in obtaining the release of their goods alleged to be on board the steamship Weisenfels. On the 21st October the Hansa Line agents issued a notice to the press stating that their steamship Uhenfels, on her return voyage from the Persian Gulf via India, has entered the neutral port of Lourenco Marques (Portuguese East Africa), where her voyage must be regarded as terminated. (iii) German firms are still very much puzzled over the export of their goods to Iran. The Turkish Government has forbidden German goods transit facilities via Trebizond, and, in any case, this route becomes impracticable for motor lorries between January and March. The transit of German goods via U.S.S.R. is still not definitely seltled, although some arrangement is expected shortly. The only remaining route is via Italian sea ports, which entail greater risk than the exporters are prepared to face. 11. Japanese Interests. A treaty of friendship was signed between Iran and Japan at Tehran on the 18th October by his Excellency Shoichi Nakayama, the Japanese Minister, and his Excellency Muzaffar Alam, the Iranian Foreign Minister. No details are known.12. Preventive Intelligence. (i) Certain suggestions have been forwarded to London for approval. These include an offer from the Polish Minister to place the results of his intelligence service in Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq at the disposal of the British authorities, this offer must, however, be confirmed by the Polish Government in France. (ii) Arrangements have been made to utilise the voluntary service of the British Indian community in Tehran for oral propaganda. Weekly meetings, as 'Vvell as the issue of a special news pamphlet, have been arranged. 13. The Iranian Army. A consular report states that Sartip (Brigadier) Syed Mahmoud Amini, General Officer Commanding 8th (Mekran) Division, has suddenly been removed from his command, and has been replaced by Sartip (Brigadier) Rafaat, late Chief Staff Officer 4th (Azerbaijan) Division. 14. Trans-Iranian Railway. (i) Good progress has been made on this line as far as Zinjan (million sheet No. 8, square A 4). Embankments and cuttings have been completed, and culverts, bridges and station buildings are now being constructed. The line between Kerej and Qazvin (million sheet No. 9, square C 4) is complete and ready for rail laying. (ii) The uncertainty as to whether the 30,000 tons of British-manufactured steel rails will be supplied according to contract signed in July is causing much anxiety. H. J.

Tehran, November 14, 1939. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 22 for the Period ending November 4, 1939. (Secret.) 1. The Shah. (i) ON the 24th October His Imperial Majesty the Shah witnessed a mobile anti-aircraft gun shoot at towed targets about 8 miles west of Tehran. Reliable observers state that the shooting was accurate and much improved. In the afternoon of the same day the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, visited Qila Murgha aerodrome to inspect the “Hurricane” fighter machine (see Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current), paragraph 1). His Imperial Majesty showed great interest and examined the machine thoroughly. After Mr. Rennell (Hawker’s test pilot) had given an exhibition flight of short duration, the Shah warmly congratulated him and suggested that he (Mr. Rennell) should take service with the Iranian air force. The Shah was obviously pleased with the machine, and expressed the hope that further “ Hurricane ” fighters could be purchased. (ii) On the 24th October His Imperial Majesty the Shah drove in State to open the 12th session of the Majlis. The Diplomatic Corps were accommodated in two boxes in the gallery of the Chamber, one being reserved for the Democratic Powers, the other for the Axis Powers, the neutrals being divided between both. The Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, entered the Chamber at 0945 hours, and in an almost inaudible voice delivered the Speech from the Throne, after which His Imperial Majesty left the Chamber and returned to the Imperial Palace. The Speech from the throne is given in Appendix “ A ” to this summary. (iii) On the 27th October the Shah inspected the progress of work on the new motor route to the Caspian via Ab-i-Ali-Ab-i-Garm (Larijan)-Amul (million sheet No. 15, square A 4). (iv) On the 2nd November His Imperial Majesty the Shah left for Gurgan (Asterabad) to attend the Turkoman autumn races. The Shah travelled by train to Semnan, and thence motored to Damghan-Shahrud and Gumbad-i-Kabus via the new Shahrud-Gurgan motor route. 2. The Crown Prince. (i) The 21st birthday of His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince was celebrated throughout the country on the 27th October. The, Crown Prince held a levee in the morning at the Abyaz Palace (an annex of the Gulistan Palace) [755 z— 1] b2 and received the congratulations of Cabinet Ministers, high Government officials and general officers of the navy, army and air force. Members of the Diplomatic Corps signed the Crown Prince’s visitors’ book at the Abyaz Palace in the afternoon in the presence of his Excellency Dr. Nafisi, Grand Master of the Crown Prince’s Household. The Protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign^ Affairs again carefully synchronised timings so that the Democratic Powers and the Axis would not clash. (ii) During the afternoon the Crown Prince and Princess attended the finals of the Olympic Games trials (see Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current), paragraph 17) at the Amjadieh Stadium. His Imperial Highness later presented cups and medals to the successful competitors. In honour of the day, girl guides and boy scouts held special parades in all large centres throughout Iran. (iii) At the Marble Palace on the 28th October the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires, his Excellency M. Shakir-el-Wadi, accompanied by Dr. Zaki Said, Iraqi Veterinary Service, formally presented to the Crown Prince four Arab thorough breds, a gift of the King of Iraq. The Crown Prince appeared to be very pleased, and asked the Iraqi representative to convey his grateful thanks and appreciation of this gift to the Regent and the Iraqi Government. 3. Iranian Officials. (i) As is customary before the inauguration of a new session of the Majlis, the Cabinet tendered its resignation to His Imperial Majesty the Shah. The Shah thereupon appointed his Excellency Dr. Matin Daftari as Prime Minister The new Cabinet is shown as Appendix “ B ” to this summary. The only important changes are that of the Prime Minister himself and the appointment of his Excellency Sarlashgar (Major-General) Amir Khosrovi, late Director of the Banque-i-Mellie (National Bank), to be Minister of Finance vice his Excellency Mahmoud Bader (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 51; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 41), relieved. Sarlashgar (Major-General) Amir Khosrovi is reported to be more friendly to the Imperial Bank of Iran than his predecessor, who was reported to be pro- German. The new Minister is likely to wage war against certain of the monopoly companies, but it remains to be seen whether he is a capable financier. (ii) His Excellency Mahmud Jam (Mudir-ul-Mulk (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 130; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 105), ex-Prime Minister, has been appointed Minister of the Court. This appointment has been vacant since the fall of Teymourtache in 1933. 4. The Saadahad Pact. An official statement has been published in Tehran that there is no truth in the rumours that a meeting of the signatories of the Saadabad Pact would be held to discuss the present world situation. 5. The Iranian A rmy. (i) No further Iranian troop movements have taken place. (ii) Various classes of reservists and conscripts whose training has been completed have been released from the colours. (iii) Military recruiting committees have begun their work in accordance with the normal procedure laid down in the Iranian Conscription Law of 1938. 6. Aerodromes. An aerodrome is being constructed 4 kilom. east of Khoi (million sheet No. 1, square A 2). 7. British Interests. (i) Sir Reader W. Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., Minister at Jedda, has been appointed His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Tehran vice Sir Horace Seymour, K.C.M.G., C.V.O., transferred to the Foreign Office as Assistant Under-Secretary of State. (ii) Mr. Walter St. C. H. Roberts, C.M.G., M.C., has been appointed counsellor, vice Mr. Nevile Butler, M.V.O., transferred to Washington. Mr. Roberts, accompanied by Mrs. Roberts, have arrived in Tehran.¥ 3 8. Japanese Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current), paragraph 11. It is reliably reported that the Irano-Japanese Treaty of Friendship contains only four articles providing for the friendship between the two nations concerned, ' 4^ diplomatic and consular relations. 9. U.S.S.R. Interests. The following is the latest reliable information on the subject of Soviet troop dispositions in the Caucasus and Turkistan :— Azerbaijan Frontier. Confirmed— Lenkoran area : 1 brigade of all arms. Nakhchevan area : 1 brigade of all arms. Gumru area (Turkish frontier) : About 20,000 troops of all artns and 50 aircraft. Unconfirmed— Baku : 1 Brigade of all arms and between 200-250 aircraft. Notes. (i) All frontier posts have been reinforced. (ii) It is confirmed that the Soviet military authorities have considerably strengthened the Baku aircraft defences. Soviet-Turkistan Frontier. It is confirmed that there are no troop concentrations, but all frontier posts have been reinforced. Soviet troops have recently been sent to Merv and Bokhara. 10. Italian Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No 21 (current), paragraph 8 (i). Colonel Napoli, agent for Ala Litoria, is still in Tehran. His secretary has been sent to Rome for further instructions. Ala Litoria propose to carry out a three- times weekly service between Tehran and Rome via Bagdad. The Iranian Government have put certain stiff proposals with regard to landing fees, rebate for Iranian officials, &amp;c., which the Italians are now investigating. If the negotiations are satisfactorily concluded the civil airport of Doshantappeh may well have to be enlarged for the reception of such aircraft. 11. The Aero Club of Iran. The press continue to publish long lists of subscribers to the Aero Club. It is reliably reported that the police and civil officials are exerting pressure on all classes to become adherents and subscribers to the club. The American Charge d’Affaires states on good authority that part of the money so collected will be used to purchase service aircraft in the United States. r ° e.

The scenery is magnificent, skirting as it does the slopes of Damavand, 18,600 feet. It is reliably stated that this route will be completed by next autumn. 13. Tehran. (i) The asphalting of the main Tehran-Gulhek—Shimran-Tajrish road (million sheet No. 9, square D 1) has been completed. (ii) The road between Tehran and Shah Abdul Azim (million sheet No. 9, square D 1) has been completely asphalted.

For “ (19 machines) ” read “ (29 machines).” Appendix “ A ” to Enclosure. Speech from the Throne. IT is a great pleasure for me to-day to inaugurate the 12th session of Parliament. The 11th session which has just come to an end was most successful and had good results. The reforms which it legislated have had an excellent effect on our economic and social affairs. With regard to Foreign Affairs our relations with all countries, and particularly with our neighbours are based on friendship and mutual respect. The lapse of our commercial agreement with the Soviet Government, and the delay in its renewal is causing a stoppage in the even flow of our commerce. I have hopes that by direct negotiations and mutual goodwill the situation will again become normal within the framework of the legal provisions of our country. The outbreak of war in Europe is very deplorable. The policy of our Govern ment is absolute neutrality,' but as the continuation of a war brings with it financial and economic difficulties for all nations, and is a menace to the civilised world, my fervent prayer is that peace will be re-established as quickly as possible.5 With regard to internal problems, the policy of our Government is the continuation of the reforms which have been already begun. I note with great joy that our people are beginning to appreciate and better understand this policy and are working for the realisation of reforms. The public also shows great keenness in everything concerning education, and above all the keenness of the young for sports and physical culture gives me particularly great pleasure. The duty of the Government, the representatives of the nation and all those interested in the welfare of our country must he a constant effort to progress in order to obtain the results which we await and to benefit all the population in the advantages of modern civilisation and progress. I pray to Almighty God to grant success to all loyal servants of our country Appendix “ B ” to Enclosure. New Cabinet of the Imperial Iranian Government.

(No. 373. Secret.) . . , HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 23 for the period ending the 18th November, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, November 29, 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 23 for the Period ending November 18, 1939. Note. —Where necessary paragraphs are lettered (A) Information regarded as definitely confirmed; (B) Information regarded as fairly reliable but requiring confirmation; and (C) Information regarded as doubtful and requiring confirmation. 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah left Gumbad-i-Kabus for Gurgan on the 5th November, visiting the model village of Ali Abad en route. At Gurgan the Shah inspected the local garrison in barracks, and later visited a newly constructed civil hospital and a hotel. On the 7th November the Shah carried out a thorough inspection of the port of Bandar Shah. In the afternoon he motored to Dashti Gurgan to witness the Turcoman Races. On arrival he was received by Cabinet Ministers, Deputies and local officials, who had arrived that morning by express train from Tehran. After the races the Shah returned to the Palace of Safiabad for the night. Continuing his tour from the 8th November to the 18th November, the Shah has visited the following towns and localities, where he inspected progress on public works, factories, housing, rural reconstruction, &amp;c. : Sari, Shahi, Amul via Babul, Shahsawar and Ramsar. As a result of the Shah’s frequent visits to Mazanderan and the pressing forward of modern improvements, &amp;c., the people of that province are extremely poverty stricken and discontented. 2. The Crown Prince and Princess. (i) His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince had his adenoids successfully removed on the 2nd November. Before being operated upon, the Crown Prince insisted on the surgeons removing their face masks. (ii) On the 16th November their Imperial Highnesses left Tehran for Ramsar via the Chalus Road, where they joined His Imperial Majesty the Shah. 3. The Iranian Army. (i) Sartip (Brigadier) Reza Quli Khan Rukni now commands the Isfahan Independent Brigade. (A) (ii) New barracks at Bandar Pahlevi and Nau Shahr (degree sheet No. 8 P, square C 2) will be completed within the next few months. A possible reorganisa tion of garrisons will then take place. (B) (iii) Conscripts are reporting in large numbers for training throughout the country. This is normal. (A) '[780 1—1] B2 IP (iv) A small number of tanks and armoured cars have been despatched temporarily to the garrisons at Meshed, Isfahan and Resht for collective laming purposes. (C) 4. The Imperial Iranian A ir Force. During the past six weeks a redistribution of aircraft has been ma throughout the air force. The present location and stiengt , as 18th November, 1939, is shown as Appendix A to this intelligence summaiy. statement cancels all previous lists of locations and strengths. (A) on Cue This 5. Danish Interests. A Danish company has signed a contract with the Imperial Iranian Govern ment for the construction of a fish canning plant in the Persian Gui . The buildings which have been completed are situated at in aibana (aegree sheet No. 25 A, square A 4), close to Bandar Abbas. The machinery is now awaited. This factory will have an estimated output of 5 tons per diem ot all sorts of canned fish, the European personnel are all Danes, who own two vessels (one trawler and one smaller fishing boat). 6. Internal Security. (i) About the 4th November a students’ strike took place at the Tehian University Medical School. The cause of the trouble was that 50 pei cent, ot the present graduating class had been ordered to enter the Army Medical Seivice. The 50 per cent, were to be selected by lot, which in practice would mean auction. As many of the students or their parents had spent considerable sums on preparing themselves for the medical profession, in which they hoped to earn a good living in private practice, there was a hostile demonstration on the appointed day for the drawing of lots. His Excellency M. Ibrahim Mer at, Minister of Education, and Sarlashgar (Major-General) Attabuy, Chief Medical Officer of the Army, were booed, and eventually armed police had to be summoned. Some twelve of the ringleaders were imprisoned. The strike continued for several days, but the students of all classes had to return to their studies as their parents were being subjected to strong pressure by the police authorities. (A) The method chosen of forcibly recruiting army doctors suggests that the attractions of private practice are sufficient to make it difficult for the army to get its quota and that the strikers had a strong vested interest at stake. (ii) Persistent rumours state that from seven to twelve officers of all arms, including cadets at the officers’ school, have been arrested for making illegal representations about army reforms, pay, &amp;c., and espionage on behalf of the IT.S.S.R. The whole affair is being kept very secret. (B) 7. The Gas Mask Factory. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 7 of 1938, paragraph 9 (i). It is reliably reported that the gas mask factory at Wanak (million sheet No. 9, square B 1) has closed down for want of raw materials and expert personnel. Seven German employees were recalled to the colours at the outbreak of the war and have not so far been replaced, although it is said that others are expected from Germany. Three German mechanics are still living on the premises. About 200-300 male and female workers are registered at the factory. Most of these have now been discharged temporarily. 8. Japanese Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 (current), paragraph 8. During the recent negotiations for the Irano-Japanese Treaty of Friendship talks were carried on at the same time with the view to arranging a trade clearing agreement between the two countries. The Japanese offered to supply cement, iron, clocks, &amp;c., and take in exchange red oxide (from the island of Hormuz), salt and cotton. They also asked for large quantities of opium, but this was, however, refused. This proposed trade agreement is in abeyance pending the outcome of the negotiations with U.S.S.R. for a renewal of their trade agreement.3 9. Czech Interests. Jheie are about 600 Czechs in Iran, most of whom are employed by firms such as bkoda-Iran, Czechko-Morayska, Iranian State Railways, &amp;c. ' With few exceptions, the majority are anti-Nazi. Three, however, are known to be spies of the Cestapo : Sedlhon, Mile. Krikgowa and Gayda, whose brother was once a Czech Chief of Staff. Skoda-Iran, whose managing director is M. Zanda. a patriot, are finding it increasingly difficult to work in Iran. They are unable to obtain materials from Germany, and. because of their nationality, orders placed in the United Kingdom and India are not being carried out. The managing director is considering the severing °f all connexion with the Prague office, which is managed by one of hieid-Marshal Goring’s brothers, and reorganising it as a purely Iranian company. 10. U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) Reliable reports state that from seven to ten Soviet officers have entered Iran and are touring in the Sauj Bulagh-Baneh area (Iranian Kurdistan). (A) 11 It is stated that negotiations for the renewal of the trading agreement between the Soviet and Iran have once again been reopened. (B) (iii) ISlotes on the Soviet air force in the Baku area are shown in Appendix B(') to this Intelligence Summary. (B) 11. German Interests. . (*) ®f ferer &gt; ce Intelligence Summary No. 12 (current), paragraph 9 (i). On the 17th November the newly appointed German Military Attache. Maior Joachim von Geldern-Crespandorf, of the German General Staff, aged 48, arrived in lehran. He is accompanied by his sister, Fraulein Erika von Geldern- Crespandorf. (ii) German oral propaganda is still increasing. During the past ten davs newsvendors have been shouting misleading statements such as “Rebellion in India against the English! ” “ 100,000 Indian soldiers killed! ” “ Eno-lish army surrounded! &amp;c. In cafes small groups have been listening to obviouslv prepared statements read out by one of their number ostensiblv from a news paper. Action to counter this has been taken. (iii) It is estimated that there are about 120 German officers and men still on board the five Hansa Line steamers at Bandar Shahpur (see Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current), paragraph 10 (ii)). I he Hansa Line steamer Uhenfels referred to in Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current), paragraph 10 (iii), apparently left Lourengo Marques, rounded the Gape and was eventually captured and taken to Freetown, Sierra Leone. (v) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current), paragraph 10 (i) The agrement for the new German Minister (Herr Ettel) has been granted. But it is possible that he may not now come, as His Imperial Majesty the Shah stated verbally that, although he would sanction the agrement, he did not particularly desire the individual concerned. 12. Minerals. non mine has been discovered 2 d miles south-west of Sirjan (Saidabad) (million sheet No. 17, square D 3) on the slopes of the Kuh-i-Ainulbagal. 13. The Trans-Iranian Railway. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current), paragraph 14 (ii). It is now known that 32,000 tons of British-manufactured steel rails will be delivered within the next six months, this news has had an extremely good effect. 14. Census. Ihe Ministry of the Interior is actively preparing for a census of the population of Tehran up to a radius of 6 kilom. from the city. The census will take place in the early spring. 15. The Press. No mention whatsoever has been made in the Iranian press of the attempt on Hitler at Munich, nor of the attempt on King Farouk of Egypt. This is in (*) Not printed. B 2 [780 1—1]■ T 4 accordance with local practice. It is interesting to note uiso that no films are ever passed by the censors which contain scenes of an assassination or plot against a crowned head. 16. Communications. C (i) The newly constructed railway bridge across the Qum River (degree sheetT No. 9 J, square D 2) about 2 kilom. south-west of the city of Qum is now open to traffic. This bridge joins the branch line Yezd-Qum to the main Trans-Iranian line. It has been built of reinforced concrete and has fourteen arches. (ii) An unconfirmed consular report states that a new road (passable by light cars) has been constructed between Sarbisheh (degree sheet No. 23 P, square D 2) and Durruh (degree sheet No. 29 D, square B 3), Iran-Afghan frontier.

Secret.) . tt- ™ • * &gt; HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 24 for the period ending the 2nd December, 1939, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, December 13, 1939. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary A'o. 24 for the Period ending December 2, 1939. (Secret.) 1. The Shah. CONTINUING his tour of the Caspian seaboard, His Imperial Majesty, accompanied by His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince and 1 rincess, entered the Province of Gilan on the 19th November, visiting Resht and Bandar Pahlavi. On the 20th November the Shah inspected progress on municipal improve ments and the harbour works. On the 22nd November the Imperial party returned to Tehran via the Chcilus i*o£tci On the 24th November the Shah received His Majesty’s Minister in a farewell audience at the Imperial Palace. Full report of this has been rendered separately. 2. British Interests. I ft, (i) His Excellency Sir Horace Seymour, K.C.M.G., M.V.O., accompanied by . jv .. Lady Seymour, Miss Seymour and Master Seymour, left Tehran for London via Bagdad on the 26th November. .... (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 (current), paragraph 3 (in). The Iranian Government have recovered the personal kit and equipment belonging to the crew of the Royal Air Force “ Blenheim ” bomber which crashed at Gulag. This has now been despatched by steamer to Karachi. The Government of India have expressed their gratitude to the Imperial Iranian Government for their action in repatriating the crew and salving their kit. (iii) A British subject, Mr. Adam Curie, aged 23, who has been sent by the Imperial Policy Group composed of certain members of Parliament to study the the Middle East situation from the political point of view, arrived in Tehran on the 24th November. Mr. Curie stated he had visited the War Office, who had given him points for which to look out. On first arrival in Tehran he proposed, in spite of obvious difficulties, to explore the Soviet-Khorassan frontier and, later, North-Western Afghanistan. Mr. Curie has now altered his itinerary and proposes visiting Azerbaijan, thereafter entering Turkey. He plans to travel to Erzerum and thence by train to Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Egypt. It is somewhat unfortunate that Mr. Curie should have arrived at this time in view of the proposed placing of a preventive intelligence representative. Mr. Curie’s movements are being closely watched by the secret police. [2—35]3. Iranian Officials. On the 22nd November His Excellency Khalil Fahimi (Eahim-ul-Mulk) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 82; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 76), Iranian Ambassador to Turkey since May 1936, returned to Tehran on relief. 4. The Iranian Army. 4 (i) Two hundred and twenty-five partially trained conscripts from the Kermanshah garrison have been despatched to the Pushtikuh area in Amnieh uniform. The reason for this is unknown, except that it might be to combat smuggling. Approximately 180 partially trained and unarmed conscripts were sent to Kermanshah from the Tehran garrison. Another 120 were sent to Shiraz. (ii) Sartip (Brigadier) Reza Quli Khan Govanlu, head of the Personal Services Branch at the Ministry of War, has been degraded and dismissed the service for accepting bribes in connexion with certain junior promotions. (iii) Sartip (Brigadier) Amini, late General Officer Commanding 8th (Mekran) Division, was dismissed from his appointment by order of the Shah for forwarding a joint petition from junior officers of the 8th (Mekran) Division asking for a special hot-weather allowance. Eight junior officers are now awaiting trial by court-martial at Khwash. (iv) Two trainloads of 105-mm. shells, amounting to about 126 tons, have recently arrived in Tehran. 5. The h 'anian Air Force. Setwan (Lieutenant) Nafez, of the Imperial Iranian air force, is shortly proceeding to London. 6. Iraqi Interests. A cavalry brigade of the Iraq army has now been permanently stationed in the neighbourhood of Khaniqin as follows :— Two regiments at Qaraghan (million sheet No. 2, square A 3). One regiment at Table Mountain (million sheet No. 2, square A 4). No counter-move by the Iranian army has so far taken place. 7. Roumanian Interests. His Excellency M. J. Conduraky has arrived in Tehran as Minister for Roumania. M. Michel Blenche, the charge d’affaires, has been recalled to Bucharest. 8. U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) Two cavalry brigades are stated to be in the immediate vicinity of Soviet Julfa on the 24th November. (ii) Notes from a traveller on the Soviet railways given as Appendix A to this summary. 9. Communications. A direct motor road has been completed between Langarud and Chamkhaleh (million sheet No. 8, square C 3). 10. The Trans-Iranian Railway. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 13. The Indian Government have made a token offer of 1,000 tons (enough for 8 miles) of steel rails, which it appears is all that can be supplied after normal requirements of the Indian Railways are fulfilled. A total of 100,000 tons of steel rails are required by Iran. 11. The National Flying Club. The press continues to publish lists of subscribers to the National Flying Club. Suitable boy scouts, aged 16 and upwards, are being obliged to ‘ c volunteer ” for the pilots’ course.12. Broadcasting. German broadcasts in Persian began on the 23rd November, 5 p.m. G.M. F., on the 19-7-metre band. This broadcast is timed to follow immediately after the Turkish broadcast in Persian. The Persian announcer at Berlin is reported to be Shahbahrami Shahrukh s/o Arbab Keikhusraw Shahrukh (Foreign Office \id^Personalities, No. 188). This individual has a German wife and was residing in Iraq prior to the outbreak of war. He is a bad character and disowned by his family. The Persian spoken is excellent. There is strong and growing criticism against the present Angora announcer. 13. Reprisals Order. The decision of His Majesty’s Government came as a severe shock to the Iranian Government. The Iranian press immediately published inspired articles and alleged letters from Iranian merchants emphasising that there was no justification for the British to stop German exports to Iran, since the goods had already been paid for in kind. The declared object of stopping foreign exchange from reaching Germany through trading with Iran does therefore not follow. Iran would suffer, but not Germany. Some mild criticism of German bad faith in deliberately holding up goods ordered by Iranian merchants has also been published. Energetic steps have been taken to furnish explanations of the recent Order in Council which has done something to diminish the first erroneous Iranian assumptions. German oral propaganda is alive in keeping this problem to the forefront. Very little mention, if any, is made of our French Allies in connexion with the Reprisals Order. 14. German Propaganda. It is reliably reported that the leading German firms in Iran, viz., Siemens, Krupp, A.E.G., Hochtiff, Undeutsch, Schliitter, Allianz Stuttgart, &amp;c., subscribe monthly sums to a fund under the supervision of the German Military Attache at the German Legation. This fund is used for propaganda purposes, both in the Iranian press and elsewhere. The German Press Attache, Herr Hans Aderholt (late of Frankfurter Zeitung), has held his present appointment for over two years. He is, in consequence, acquainted with Iranian press circles and actually administers this fund. There is no doubt that a number of editors receive certain allowances through the agents of Herr Aderholt. Since the war began, however, strict censorship and control has been exercised over the press, and it is now not so easy for the Germans to obtain publicity more than the Allies. German firms, too, support by regular subscriptions for advertisements. Recently newsvendors (see Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 11 (ii), have been shouting false news. When questioned, they stated that they had orders to do so. It has since been ascertained that certain newsvendors used to visit the firm of Schliitter. Five newsvendors have now been arrested. Within the past ten days head-lines have not been printed in any of the Iranian newspapers. Previously these head lines contained a pro-German bias, and were often quite misleading to the telegrams which followed. 15. Obituary. On the 24th November the death took place in Tehran of his Excellency Abdul Hussein Farman-Farmayan (Farman Farma), G.C.M.G. (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 84; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 77). Born in 1857 at Qajar, deceased was a great-grandson of Path Ali Shah.

Copy No. Mr. Roberts to Viscount Halifa,x.—(Received January 10, 1940.) (No. 402. Secret.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 25 for the period ending the 16th December, 1939, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, December 27. 1939. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 25 for the Period ending December 16, 1939. 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah has remained in residence at the Imperial Palace in Tehran during the period under review. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) On the 5th December Aghai Abul Hassan Pirnia (Muazid-us-Saltaneh) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 211—Foreign Office Personalities, No. 155) died. He had been suffering from heart attacks for some months and on the night of the 4th-5th December, when returning on foot across the river from the town to his house, appears to have had a fatal attack. A curious circumstance is that the servant who was accompanying him had a similar attack at the same time. It was not until the next morning that the two corpses were discovered in the river bed. Sartip (Brigadier) Amidi, General Officer Commanding 7th (Ears) Division, refused to invite His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz to attend the official funeral of the late Governor on the grounds that C£ he could have nothing to do with consuls.” This is further example of the lengths to which the boycott of foreigners is carried out in the provinces. (ii) M. Mohsin Medhat has been appointed Iranian Consul at Trieste. This is a new post. (iii) M. Ahmed Ram, former director of the Tobacco Monopoly, has been appointed Director-General of the Department of Agriculture vice Sarlashgar (Major-General) Tajbakhsh, dismissed. 3. The Iranian A rmy. (i) Reports have been received that the Service de 1’Intendance (Supply Department) have recently been largely increasing the reserves of grain, fodder and food-stuffs. (ii) A further order for 2,000 motor-cycle combinations without machine guns or mountings has been placed with the Eabrique nationale beige. These are to be delivered early next year. (iii) An order for 100,000 rifles (F.N.) with 12 million cartridges originally ordered for the Spanish Republican army (Reds) and which had not been delivered will be taken over by the Iranian military authorities. (iv) 2,135 tons of military stores and ammunition have recently been delivered in Tehran. This figure includes the tonnage mentioned in Intelligence Summary No. 24 (current), paragraph 4 (iv). (v) An Iranian Army Order issued on the 7th December states that all military officers in possession of private firearms must declare them immediately to the Ministry of War. [814 k—1](vi) Between 300-400 Amnieh (Road Guards) have been discharged from the Amnieh forces in Tehran and Qazvin districts. (vii) Reports from Azerbaijan state the units of the 3rd (Rezaieh) Division have now been withdrawn to their normal stations. 4. German Interests. (i) Quantities of tea and coffee made up into small packages containing about 100 grammes are being posted to Germany by individual Germans. (ii) It is reliably reported that the crews (less care and maintenance parties) of the five German Hansa Line steamers now lying at Bandar Shahpur are being repatriated to Germany via Russia. (iii) Germans recently arrived from the Fatherland use very violent language against England. They are, however, still certain of victory. They state there is an abundance of food in Germany except for butter. They do not believe the attempt on Hitler had its origin in England, but put it down to the “ same people whose traces you can see in Berlin after a black-out.' Complaints have been heard of the attitude of the Berlin people. o. U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) There is still little or no hope of a renewal of the trade agreement between Iran and the Soviet. (ii) An Iranian Mission consisting of two merchants and two officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, headed by M. Hamid Sayar, left for Moscow on the 12th December. It is said that they are a delegation to the Agricultural Exhibition in Moscow. (iii) There is considerable unrest in Soviet Turkestan. A general officer of the Red army endeavoured to escape into Khorasan recently but was recaptured near an Iranian post some distance over the frontier. (iv) The French report the departure from Tehran for Meshed or Afghanistan of several known Ogpu agents. (v) A report on the location of Soviet units in Turkestan is given as Appendix “ A” to this Intelligence Summary.^) (vi) A consular report from Zahidan states that a Russian named Kartashoff, speaking fluent English and French, is on his way from the interior of Iran to Zahidan, whence he intends to attempt to cross into India. The description given tallies with that of Issac Kartachov, charge d’affaires and counsellor of the Soviet Embassy, who mysteriously disappeared shortly after the arrival of the new Soviet Ambassador, vide Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current), para graph 7. Further details are awaited. (vii) The French report that there has been an increase of Soviet troops in the Astara area, which now total approximately two brigades. Abnormal numbers of officers and men of the Red army are seen travelling on the trains between Baku-Tiflis-Batum. 6. Internal Security. (i) The political secret police are still active. Among the civilians arrested are : — The headmaster of the Industrial School (“ Deutsche Gewerbeschule '), Amir Saham-ud-Din Ghaffari (Zuka-ed-Dowleh) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 97—Foreign Office Personalities, No. 89). This individual is reputed to be pro-German, but is also noted for his indiscreet criticisms of the present regime. M. Flacoob, owner of the Famish Printing Press, who were apparently engaged in printing German propaganda leaflets. M. A. Sepehr (Muvarakh-ed-Dowleh), an old man. M. Mohsin Qalhur, Deputy-Governor of Kermanshah, &amp;c. A number of military officers and military cadets have also been arrested, one of whom, Reserve Lieutenant (Sitwan) Yaja Sayadi, committed suicide in prison. High military and police circles fear plotting, backed by the Soviets, against the present regime. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 6 (i). Medical students have been offered 300 rials per mensem, plus the usual army pay of rank, if they will join the Army Medical Service. Few have accepted these conditions. p) Not printed.3 7. Broadcasting. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 24 (current), paragraph 12. The Germans’ broadcasts continue daily, and are composed of the usual propaganda and news. The reception was at first weak, but has improved recently. The name f Mohsin Jamarani of Tehran is quoted as joint announcer at Berlin. This individual is a student who refused to return to Iran at the outbreak of war. He comes from a well-known ecclesiastical family of Tehran. The general effect of German broadcasts in Persian is not yet apparent. (ii) The Delhi broadcast in Kabuli Persian is well received in Tehran. 8. Japanese Interests. r I he Japanese firm of Mitsui is negotiating for the sale of a number of dual control instructional aircraft for the Aero Club of Iran. 9. United States Interests. (i) Dr. Schmidt, of the Chicago University Expedition at Persepolis, is now closing down and has presented the aeroplane belonging to the expedition to the Aero Club of Iran. The machine is a four-seater “ Waco ' 1935 model, fitted with one 225 h.p. Jacobs engine. It has not been flown for some time. The Aero Club have accepted the gift with great satisfaction. (ii) The Iranian Government have tried unsuccessfully to raise loans in the United States for 15 million dollars. 10. Tribal Unrest. The Turkomans in general, whether on the Russian or Persian side of the border, are bitterly hostile to the Soviet regime. Many of those who fled to Iran have been treated little better than those remaining in Soviet Turkestan, and a number of them have as a result returned to their homes. It is considered that, if the Soviet were to attempt any aggression against Iran, Turkomans in Russia w T ould immediately revolt and endeavour to throw off the Bolshevik yoke. Their fellow tribesmen in Iran would only be too ready to help them. 11. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Consular reports from Ahwaz state that on receipt of the world-wide warning telegram of possible German sabotage of oil plants, the Abadan executive held a conference at which the conclusions arrived at were :— (i) The oil company had to rely on the Iranian authorities in Khuzistan and Kermanshah for surveillance and exclusion of potential agents, (ii) That precautions against the entry of agents into the refinery area were to be increased. (iii) That Amnieh (road guards) were to he asked to guard vulnerable points along the pipe-line and refinery. Two hundred extra Amnieh guards were accordingly applied for. A list of vulnerable points was also supplied to the authorities, and a request made that detectives should be stationed at Bandar Shahpur and along the railway and pipe line to prevent enemy agents approaching Abadan across country. At the outbreak of war it was reported, and later confirmed, that the military and police authorities in Khuzistan and Kermanshah had taken up immediate dispositions to guard the oil plant {vide military attach^, Tehran, telegrams Nos. 47 and 49, addressed to all concerned). It would, therefore, appear that the oil company executives had originally not worked out a scheme in collaboration with the civil authorities, or if there was a scheme it was unsatisfactory, or that the precautions had been relaxed. The Abadan manager of the oil company received news of this world-wide warning from four sources, viz., Senior Naval Officer—A.I.O.C.. head office Bagdad and military attach^, Tehran, through chief manager. 12. German Propaganda. Recently leaflets in English have been distributed by the German Consulate at Tabriz. These leaflets, printed in Germany, are as follows :— “ Hitler’s would-be assassin caught.” “Adolf Hitler’s speech in the Burgesbraukeller.” “British preparations for starving out Germany.”4 X 13. Dutch Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 18 (current), paragraph 6. This information is now unconfirmed. 14. Machine-Gun Factory. • ‘ Reference Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current), paragraph 9. Good progress has been made with the building of this factory, and part of the machinery has been delivered. No experts, either from the former Czecho slovakia or Germany, have arrived. 15. Credit Loan. Negotiations are still proceeding in London and Tehran for export credits to Iran amounting to £5 million sterling. 16. Preventive Intelligence. A copy of a letter addressed to the Director-General of the G.P.U. at Moscow, forwarded to one Comrade Petrovsky at Tehran, has been intercepted and photographed by the French. The letter contained news of Kashgar, and stated that progress was being made in organising a revolt in Afghanistan and in India, also that our counter-espionage at Kashgar had been very successful. The letter was signed by one Inglan, and is thought to have come from Kashgar or Kabul. In the letter Comrade Kamarov is mentioned as having unfortunately been recalled to Moscow. Comrade Joseph at Kashgar has recently been in touch with Chief Sher Mekhti Khan. A certain Ar .... is also mentioned as a Soviet agent in Afghanistan (Kabul or Kandahar). 17. Public Opinion. Pro-Ally Iranian circles continue to state that the major portion of Iranian current opinion is much in favour of Germany. They frankly say that the reason for this is the British diplomatic policy of indifference or laissez faire during the past years. “ Britain has made no effort to prevent the now considerable German penetration of Iran, nor has she encouraged Iran to take a firmer attitude with the Soviets. Lastly, she has not made any effort to maintain her own position.” As a result the prestige of Britain in Iran is, they state, at a low ebb. The attitude of the “ man in the street ” is that Britain was responsible for placing the present Shah on the throne, therefore Britain is to blame for the present economic distress and troubles in Iran. This last opinion is naturally fanned by Russian propaganda. 18. Shipping. On the 10th December at Bandar Pahlevi a dredger named Mazanderan was launched from the slipways of Messrs. Chikhao and Messrs. Julius Berger (a German firm). Details of the vessel are as follows :— Length : 76 metres. Beam: 13-40 metres. Length of dredging apparatus : 10 metres. Draught : 4 metres. Tonnage: 1,878. Speed : 9 miles per hour empty. Motors : 3,000 c.v., of which 1,150 c.v. is used by dredging machinery. Dredging capacity : 800 cubic metres of sand or mud per hour. At the launching ceremony reference was made to the necessity of dredgers in view of the inexplicable recedence of the Caspian Sea within recent years (see Intelligence Summary No. 25 of 1938, paragraph 17).

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the period ending the 30th December, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran. January 10. 1940. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the Period ending December 30, 1939. (Secret.) 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah remained in residence at the Imperial Palace in Tehran during the period under review. 2. The Crown Prince. On the 18th December His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince inspected progress on the machine-gun factory and also visited the aircraft factory at Doshantappeh. 3. Iranian Officials. (i) His Excellency Ali Ashgar Hikmat. Minister of the Interior, has returned to Tehran from sick leave in Europe. (ii) His Excellency Mohammed Shayesteh (Foreign Office Personalities, No. 196), Director-General at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, has been appointed Iranian Minister at Washington, United States. 4. British Interests. (i) On the 30th December his Excellency Sir Reader William Bullard. K.C.M.G., C.I.E., presented his letters of credence to His Imperial Majesty the Shah at the Gulistan Palace. His Imperial Majesty looked fit and was in an unusually genial mood. From his conversation it seemed that the Shah was satisfied that His Majesty's Govern ment was making efforts to meet his wishes over the question of credits, railway material and aircraft, &amp;c. The Shah, however, emphasised that he regarded German goods up to the value of the clearing balance (40 million reichsmarks) in Iran’s favour as already the property of Iran. He considered that delivery of these goods will only weaken Germany and, therefore, benefit the Allies as well as Iran. It would be incomprehensible should these goods be seized by the Allies. Moreover, further war material was required to increase the ability of Iran to maintain her neutrality. (ii) Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Underwood, British Military Attache, toured in Isfahan and Kashan districts from the 23rd December to the 26th December, inclusive. (iii) The secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society in Iran reports that 55.672 volumes of the Holy Scriptures were sold in Iran during the year 1939. This is by far the highest number sold in any one year. [2—36]2 5. United States Interests. It is stated that the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey are negotiating for the oil-prospecting rights in the areas previously explored by the Amiranian Company. 6. German Interests. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 4 (ii). Approximately 100 sailors employed by the Hansa Line have passed through Tehran en route to Germany via IJ.S.S.R. About seventy-five remain in Bandar Shahpur. (ii) German nationals have been forbidden by the police to remain ip the Province of Khuzistan (Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s area). (iii) Two Russian steamers have recently arrived at Bandar Pahlevi carrying 5,000 bales of cotton goods and 300 tons of cotton and woollen piece-goods. These are the first important arrivals of goods from Germany via Varna and Batoum. (iv) A letter addressed in error to the Ahwaz branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran by Messrs. Sorger and Timmermann of Bremen states that they are desirous of purchasing urgently quantities of fats, butter, oil seeds, rice, wax, peas, lentils, haricots, jute, spices, tea, dried fruits, &amp;c., and suggest that such goods be railed to Batoum for shipment or railed to Leningrad. They, however, request Persian dealers to arrange themselves for the necessary transit permits with the Soviet authorities. 7. U.S.S.R. Interests. Troops of Soviet Azerbaijan origin serving on the Azerbaijan-Iran frontier have been replaced by Soviet troops from elsewhere in Russia. 8. The Iranian Army. (i) In accordance with article 5 of the Iranian Conscription Law, all persons born during the years 1299 (1920-21), as well as persons previously exempted, have been ordered to report for military service on the 7th March, 1940. (ii) Conscripts of the Tehran garrison, who will complete their two years’ compulsory service in March 1940, are now carrying out field training. (iii) The General Officers Commanding the 3rd, 4th and 5th Divisions, together with the Minister of War and Chief of the General Staff, attended conferences at the Imperial Palace, Tehran, on the 20th. 21st and 22nd December. (iv) The Iranian General Staff have prepared a mobilisation scheme by which ten classes could be called up within three to four days. (y) The Fabrique Nationale beige have been asked for quotations for the following war materials :— S.A.A. : 20 million rounds. Browning machine guns : 200 (later to be increased to J.OOO). 9. Broadcasting. \ he Iranian Government have now made it clear that, in view of the growing number of broadcasts in the Persian language, there is no objection, from their point of view, to the B.B.C. broadcasting in Persian. 10. Census. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 (current), paragraph 14. All buildings in Tehran and environs have been renumbered in preparation for the coming census. 11. Enemy Propaganda. (i) Enemy oral propaganda has been active in stirring up trouble between Iraq and I rap. Reports have been circulated in Bagdad alleging that it was the intention of the Iranian Government to attack Iraq and that troops are being concentrated for this purpose. It was further stated that public demonstrations had been made against the Iraqi Legation in Tehran, and that Iraqi nationals in Iran had been arrested. These statements are entirely without foundation. The Iranian Government is taking active steps to tr-ace those responsible and very3 much resent these false rumours being circulated. Inspired articles have appeared in the press attacking the lying nature of German propaganda, with special reference to false reports regarding Iran. (ii) German propaganda leaflets in English continue to be distributed in Tabriz. The latest leaflets are entitled :— “ Britain robs France of her gold.” British Government s war guilt c confirmed by British Blue Book. 1 he Governor-General, on instructions from Tehran, has ordered the police to trace the source of these leaflets and to prevent any further distribution. Their effect in Tabriz is negligible as few people can read English. They have, however, an irritative value'. 12. The Iranian Press. An interesting editorial appeared in the official Ittilaat on the 23rd December. This stated that the decision of the Government to remain neutral had the approval of all classes, and that neutrality had been fully observed. The Government's reason for this decision was not a desire to avoid responsibility nor to have an easy time. The people were ready to sacrifice themselves for their country should the need arise. In the past they had always been ready to do so under a great leader, and now, as then, their patriotism made them ready to sacrifice themselves for the national well-being. Finally, the article hoped that this unity of thought would protect them from all evil intentions. The reasons for the above article are not clear, but it is suggested that pressure may be brought to bear on the Imperial Government by the Soviets, and the Iranian people are therefore being prepared for eventual armed resistance to Russian demands if necessary. The Finnish successes may well have encouraged the Government to think Russia is not so formidable after all. On the other- hand, it may be to sound the reaction of the people were they, in fact, asked to sacrifice themselves for their country by resisting possible Russian aggression. 13. Finnish-Russian War. Great interest is being taken in the Russian campaign in Finland, and hope is expressed that the Finnish resistance will deter the Russians from making any attack upon Turkey, which would inevitably involve Iran, or upon Iran itself. Opinion is, however, general that Finland will eventually be crushed by superior numbers when the weather conditions improve. It is interesting to note that German broadcasts in Persian realise that the instinctive sympathy of Persians will be for the Finns and, without committing themselves, leave the wishful thinking of the Persians to do the rest.

Tehran, January 23, 1940. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 1 for the Period ending January 13, 1940. (Secret.) 1. The Shah. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Imperial family remain in residence at the Imperial Palace in Tehran. 2. The Imperial Family. On the 8th January, the fifth anniversary of the emancipation of Iranian women, Her Imperial Highness the Crown Princess Fowzieh, accompanied by their Imperial Highnesses the Princess Shahdukht Shams Pahlevi and the Princess Ashraf Pahlevi, attended a soiree at the Tehran Ladies Club. They were received by the president, Mme. Daulat Abadi. During the course of the evening telegrams of congratulations and loyalty were despatched to their Imperial Majesties the Shah and the Empress. The newly-formed orchestra of the Tehran Conservatoire of Music, taught by M. Zoubek and other Czech musicians, played during the ceremony. The anniversary was also observed throughout the provinces. 3. Iranian Army. (i) It is reported that His Imperial Majesty the Shah has appointed His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince Inspector-General of the Army. Another report states that the Crown Prince has been appointed commander of the Army Corps of Defence. This will consist of the Tehran Garrison (1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions, cavalry division and the mechanised brigade). (ii) All retired and unemployed officers have been ordered to register at the Ministry of War, or if residing in the provinces at the local divisional head quarters. Several well-known officers on the unemployed list have been re-employed and promoted, viz. :— Sarhang (Colonel) All Khan Riazi, promoted to Sartip (Brigadier). Sarhang (Colonel) Saifullah Shehab, promoted to Sartip (Brigadier). Sarhang (Colonel) Ansari, promoted to Sartip (Brigadier). The above were educated at St. Cyr and the Ecole de Guerre. It is known that two well-known general officers residing in Europe have been asked to return to Iran. (iii) Following the conference held on the 20th-22nd December (see Intelligence Summary No. 26 (1939), paragraph 8 (iii)), progressive mobilisation has been ordered. The 3rd, 4th and 5th Divisions will now be brought up to [2—83]— *7 7' strength. Next in order will be the 9th and bth Divisions. The whole mobilisa tion 18 to be completed within three months. It is not known what difference in an^f 000 S ma ^ e total strengths, but possibly only between 3,000 ^ v ) Artillery brigades are to be formed in each division. This is considered impossible for lack of armament and horses. q , ( v ) ^ ar ^ as hg ar (Major-General) Amin, late General Officer Commanding, sth (Mekran) Division, has been appointed Inspector-General of Artillery. (vi) An official dementi was published on the 2nd January denying that con centration of Iranian troops had taken place on the northern frontier. • ( vn ) Referen ce Intelligence Summary No. 25 (1939), paragraph 6 (i). Six junior officers have been shot as a result of the finding of the recent court-martial. ( v m) ^ is reported that the military authorities are issuing rifles and ammunition to certain sections of the Shahsavan tribe located in the mountainous country between Ardebil and Tabriz. * , (/ x ) divisions are to be formed in the Ardebil-Resht area or both at Ardebil and Reslit, also at Kermanshah. The Gurgan Garrison is to be increased } one bi igade. This may be correct, as French sources state that provisions have been made m army estimates for 1940-41 for an increase in army strength by two divisions and one cavalry brigade. ° J (x) From the beginning of January the General Officer Resht (Independent) brigade, accompanied by civilian officials of the Department of Roads and Com munications, has been reconnoitring the roads north and north-west of Ardebil (million sheet No. 8, square A 2). 4. Air Raid Precautions. No arrangements for civil A R P. have yet been made in any of the cities or towns of Iran. J 5. Iranian State Railways. An official notice issued by the Railway Administration, states that the line 'iffinl' daniI'ar'y 11 ]?)4() KereJ W1 be ° Pei1 f ° r P assen S er and goods traffic from the 6. Polish Interests.

Swedish Interests. The fifty batteries (four guns each) of Bofors 75-mm. mountain guns ordered Sweden ranian Governraent a y ear a g° are now awaiting shipment to Iran from 8. Turkish Interests. On receipt of the news of the Anatolian earthquake immediate telegrams of sympathy were sent to the Turkish President by His Imperial Maiesty the Shah the Prime Minister, the President of the Majlis and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Imperial Majesty the Shah sent a donation of £10,000 (Turkish) through the Imperial Bank of Iran to the Turkish Government and a public subscription list has been opened by the Lion and Red Sun Society. 9. French Interests. On the 13th January his Excellency M. Jean Helleu, the new French Minister, presented his letters of credence to His Imperial Maiesty the Shah at the Gulistan Palace. M. Helleu was formerlly Minister at Tallinn. The Shah received the French Minister cordially, and again repeated his request that Iranian goods should be allowed shipment to Iran.3 10. German Interests. W ^ r e i i nai1 Military Attache, Major von Geldern Crespandorf, is not ° Cl f'\ ^ e 1 ( ^ 0 ^ nise( ^’ as is pointed out he is only an assistant military attache. (n) All German nationals, with the exception of the care and maintenance ^^parties on board the five Hansa Line steamers (approximately fifty-sixty), and o even Hungarians employed by Messrs. Kampsax have been removed from uzistan The Hungarians are reported to be fanaticallv pro-German and are a potential danger. 11. Japanese Interests. Military Attache, Colonel Takasina, returned to Tehran on Q e 'flu Jamuary after visiting Rome, Berne, Berlin, Stockholm and Moscow. At Stockholm Colonel Takasina endeavoured to obtain a visa to enter Finland, but was refused. During the course of a recent conversation the Japanese Military Attache stated that he was of the opinion that, if Russia did intend attacking Iran, it would be carried out by mechanised columns, supported by aircraft and parachutists, but in the early summer. The mechanised columns would advance simultaneously in Azerbaijan and Khorasan. 12. Italian Interests. (0 d riestino Shipping Line are to increase their sailings between Italy and the Persian Gulf. Strenuous efforts are being made to capture the trade carried formerly by the Hansa Line. (ii) Negotiations are still proceeding for the sale of forty to eighty bombers to the Iranian Government. I he Italian Government are, however, insisting on payment in cash and will not grant credits. (iii) As the Iranian Government has refused permission to the Ala Littoria Airline to extend its service to Tehran, it has now been proposed that a joint Irano-Italian Airline be formed to operate between Tehran and Rome. ’ The Ala Littoria Company have sent their Bagdad manager to Tehran to discuss this new suggestion. (iv) The Italian Minister, in conversation with the British Military Attache, said he had heard from German circles that, if Russia attacked Iran, it would be by means of mechanised columns. 13. United States Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 26 of 1939, paragraph 5. The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey have now been informed that the Iranian Govern ment do not intend granting any further concessions during the war. 14. Soviet Interests. (i) One motorised and one mechanised division have joined the Trans- Caucasian district.

An audience was therefore arranged at the Marble Palace for Thursday, the 18th January. The Crown Prince conversed with His Majesty’s Minister for about an hour on international affairs, in which he (the Crown Prince) takes a keen interest. His Imperial Highness’s attitude to the present war was roughly that it was a nuisance and ought not to have been allowed to happen. Only Danzig stood between the world and peace! 3. Iranian Cabinet and other Officials. A list of members of the Imperial Iranian Cabinet and other officials is given as Appendix C£ A ” to this summary. 4. The Iranian Army. (i) The Ministry of War have moved into a newly built Ministry. (ii) The Remount Department have failed in their effort to purchase a further number of Hungarian horses.

It is 44 kilom. in length. Two hundred bridges had to be constructed on this section, the most important being the bridge at Kan and also one which spans the Kerej River, which is 180 metres long and has seven arches, each of 20 metres. The scheduled time for the journey from Tehran to Kerej is one hour. 7. French Interests. (i) The French Military Attache, le Commandant Alessandri, left Tehran by car for Kabul on the 14th January, travelling via Meshed and Zahidan. (ii) The new French Minister, his Excellency M. Jean Helleu. paid an official call on the Soviet Ambassador on the 20th January. To make the conversation as little inflammatory as possible, the French Minister talked about domestic troubles and, in particular, about the difficulty of keeping the French Legation warm. He said he proposed to have central heating installed and hoped that tho work would be completed before next winter. At this the Soviet Ambassador smiled and said in Russian, which the French Minister understands: “Let’s wait and see.’' M. Helleu is confident that the smile was more sly than a mere dig at Persian procrastination would have warranted. 8. Italian Interests. (i) The Italian Naval and Air Attache, Capitano di Fregata Mola, returned to Tehran from Rome on the 23rd January. In Rome Commander Mola was received by Signor Mussolini and discussed the sale of Italian aircraft to Iran.

The Italian Naval Attache admits that the Shah is not enthusiastic about the proposed deal. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 12 (ii). Negotiations between representatives of the Ala Littoria Airlines and the Iranian Government are reported to be progressing favourably. A three-times weekly service may well commence in the late spring.

Indian-Iranian Commercial Relations. • If the anticipated expansion of trade between India and Iran justifies the expense, negotiations may take place with a view to the reconditioning of the Nok Kundi-Mirjawa section of the Nok Kundi-Zahidan Railway. A motor road may also be constructed between Nok Kundi and Mir j awa.11. Consular Diaries. Consular diaries have been restarted.

ON the 28th January (Id-i-Ghadir) at the Gulistan Palace, His Imperial Majesty the Shah attended by His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, received the homage and congratulations of Cabinet Ministers, Government officials and civilian deputations. Two of the younger princes (Shahpur Ghulam Reza and Shahpur Abdul Reza Pahlevi), have been taking part in winter sports, ski-ing, luge-ing, &amp;c. Both were awarded prizes in open competitions. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) His Excellency Mohammad Ali Muqaddam (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 182; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 127), has been appointed Iranian Minister at the Court of St. James and has already left for England. (ii) His Excellency Abdullah Bahrami (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 57; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 45), Iranian Minister in Brussels has been recalled to Tehran. 3. The Iranian Army. (i) On the 2nd February, 1940, an Imperial decree was published calling up live classes of reservists for one month’s training. The classes affected are as follows :— 1285 (1907). 1288 (1910). 1290 (1912). 1292 (1914). 1294 (1916). The numbers affected are estimated to be between 20,000 and 30,000. The normal procedure at this time of the year is to call up one class of reservists for training. The calling up of five classes has caused much comment. In Iranian official circles it is openly admitted that these reservists will not be released after one month’s training.2 (ii) It is now stated that the Iranian Army will be expanded as under :— New infantry divisions— Gurgan : 10th division. Gilan : 11th division. Kermanshah : 12th division. Isfahan : 13th division. Kerman : 14th division. Bujnurd : 15th division. New cavalry divisions— Kuchan : 2nd cavalry division. Khoi : 3rd cavalry division. (iii) Sixteen cadet officers of the senior officers’ class of the officers’ school have been commissioned and posted to engineer units. This would normally not have taken place until June. (iv) Forty students of the Tehran Commercial College have been granted commissions as reserve officers. (v) A staff exercise will be held at Ardebil for the senior students of the Staff College after the review on the 23rd February. ^ (vi) The new commander designate of the 8th (Mekran) Division is stated to be Sartip Mahmud Khan Memana, who formerly commanded the Isfahan Garrison and is now commanding the artillery of the 1st Division. (vii) According to a consular report from Tabriz, about 3,000 men, both cavalry and infantry, left Rezaieh for the Soviet frontier in the neighbourhood of Maku. (yiii) It is persistently rumoured that a meeting of the General Officers Com manding the Rezaieh and Tabriz Divisions, with certain high Turkish Staff Officers, took place on the 30th January somewhere on the Irano-Turkish frontier. 4. The Iranian Air Force. (\) On the 7th February the “ Hurricane ” fighter machine returning from a practice flight landed badly (on one wheel of under-carriage), resulting in the wings being damaged and the air screw bent. The machine was hurriedly taken to a hangar where the damaged parts were removed by two Rolls-Royce engineers (Messrs. Wall and Maine) and despatched to the Doshantappeh Aircraft Factory, where mechanics are making frantic efforts to get the machine airworthy in time for the Imperial Military Review, which takes place on the 23rd February, 1940. Iranian Air Force officers concerned are reported to be terrified lest the Shah should hear of the accident. It is stated that the air screw has been straightened and will shortly undergo the necessary tests. (ii) The Iranian Air Force authorities are still anxiously waiting news as to whether British bombing and fighting aircraft will be released on purchase. According to the British mechanics employed with the Iranian Air Force, fifteen of the Hurricane type of aircraft have been released by the Air Ministry and will be delivered in Iran by the end of May. Further, the two Rolls-Royce engineers, whose contracts have already expired, have been asked by the Iranian Government to remain on their own terms until after the machines have arrived This they have agreed to do. The Italian offer to supply certain types of aircraft is in abeyance. The Italians are frankly puzzled, as they were under the impression that their deal had practically been settled. They had no idea that the British would be still in a position to supply aircraft to neutral countries. 5. The S.S. Aramestan. S.S. Aramestan belonging to Messrs. Strick Lines and chartered by a Belgian concern, was sunk by a German U-boat off the coast of Portugal. The caro-o, which included 4,700 tons of steel rails and 2,000 tons of sugar, was consigned from Belgium to Iran. Fhe first news of the sinking of this vessel was received at His Majesty’s Legation from Iranian official sources. On the 11th February the Iranian press published a D.N.B. (German news agency) telegram describing the torpedoing of the armed British merchantman the s.s.' Aramestan, carrying war material to Turkey. ’ J &amp;3 After representations had been made about this gross partiality in favour of Germany, the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs admitted it was by the Shah’s orders that the item of news about the sinking of rails and sugar destined for Iran was not published. On the 16th February the full facts were published in the press. 6. German Interests. (i) The German Government recently offered to send to Iran expert German hospital nurses in order to train Iranian nurses, but the offer was refused. The German Government then invited the Iranian medical authorities to send -Iranian doctors to Germany to study hospital organisation, &amp;c.; this invitation has been accepted. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 9 (ii). During the period under review Herbert Dittmann, accompanied by a Herr Muller have arrived in Tehran as counsellor and secretary respectively of the German Legation. Herr Dittmann was formerly a consul in Jerusalem. Explaining his rapid promotion in the German diplomatic service, Herr Dittmann told an American colleague that for the past two years he had been employed with the Personnel Branch of the German Foreign Office. To the same individual he expressed the view that the Allied concentration of troops in Syria and Egypt was a threat to Russia and the Baku oilfields. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 9 (iv). The export of tea, coffee, soap, &amp;c., to all foreign countries by means of the parcels post has now been forbidden by the Imperial Iranian Government. (iv) The number of German businessmen and others concentrated in Tabriz is stated to be about fifty. This may be in connexion with the arrangements for the export of Iranian goods, via Julfa, Tiflis and Batum. (v) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 10 (ii) Sixty-five German sailors remain at Bandar Shahpur with the Hansa Line ships Each British ship entering this port is carefully photographed by the Germans. 7. British Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 of 1939, paragraph 3 (ii) “ Sardar Sahib ” Sahib Singh a prominent Sikh merchant of Tehran has donated a sum of 6,000 rupees to the British Red Cross Society. 8. Air Raid Precautions. The Iranian press have lately published several articles on the duties of civilians during air raids. The articles treat the subject very generallv It is reliably stated that municipalities have been warned to include estimates for the construction of A.R.P. shelters, &amp;c., in their budgets for the coming year. 9. The A ero Club. Tenders have been invited for the construction of an up-to-date aerodrome 10 kilometres west of Tehran and south of the Tehran—Kerej railway line The site is on the whole a good one, but will necessitate the piping of two laro- e kanats ’ and the diverting of the Kand river. ^ H. J. UNDLRWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache. Tehran, February 10, 1940. Enclosure 2. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 4 for the 'period ending February 24, 1940. 1. The Shah. ON the morning of the 22nd February, His Imperial Majesty the Shah accompanied by His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, dined at the Officer’s Club with general officers of the navy, army and air force, as well as the officers of [3-122] B 2the Tehran Garrison. The Turkish Military Attache was the only foreign military attache to be invited. On arrival, the Shah visited all the different dining rooms and then proceeded to the Crown Prince’s private suite. Dinner ^as served to the Shah in the senior officers' dining room. After dinner the Shah made a short speech, which was relayed by loud speakers to the various dining rooms. The Shah praised the progress, zeal and loyalty of his armed forces as a whole. He concluded his remarks by proposing the toast of the Imperial Forces. Sarlashgar (Major-General) Muhammad Nakhchevan (Amir Muwassaq) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 194—Foreign Office Personalities, No. 144) replied for Sarlashgar (Major-General) Azizullah Zarghami, Acting Chief of the General Staff, absent through indisposition. Among those present was Sarlashgar (Major-General) Jehanbani (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 132—Foreign Office Personalities, No. 103), only recently released from prison who appeared to be in a very weak state of health. (ii) On the afternoon of the 23rd February, the nineteenth anniversary of the coup d’Etat, the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, and the Princes were present at a review of the Tehran Garrison and youth organisations on the Jalalieh Race-Course. (iii) It is reliably stated that the Shah proposes visiting Khuzistan in the near future. 2. The Iranian Army. (i) Troops of the 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions, 1st Cavalry Division and the Mechanised Brigade took part in the usual Annual Military Review at the Jalalieh Race-Course on the 23rd February, 1940. (ii) A new division is to be formed at Khurramabad. (iii) A consular report from Meshed confirms two cavalry regiments moving to Kuchan, and two infantry regiments to Bujnurd (see Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 3 (ii)). 3. British Interests. (i) Mr. F. Knight, the service representative of Messrs. Hawkers Aircraft, has returned to Tehran from leave in the United Kingdom. According to Mr. Knight it is possible that a certain number of ‘ ‘ Blenheim ’ ’ bombing aircraft will be released for sale to the Iranian Government in the near future. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 4 (ii). Mr. Knight states that the delivery of the fifteen “ Hurricane ” fighters is to be expedited, but it is very doubtful whether they will arrive before the end of May. (iii) The British Government have signed an agreement to grant £5 million exports credit to Iran. 4. Italian Interests. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 4 (ii). The Italian Naval and Air Attache has officially informed the Iranian Minister of War that the offer of Italian military aircraft to the Iranian Government must now be considered as lapsed. If the Imperial Iranian Government wish to reopen the matter at any time, then the negotiations will have to begin on some other basis. In this connexion a vague suggestion was recently made to the Tehran manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company that perhaps the Iranian Government might acquire Italian aircraft in exchange for oil. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 8 (ii). Negotiations between the Iranian Government and the representatives of the Ala Littoria Airlines are stated to be still progressing favourably. 5. German Interests. On the 19th February the new German Minister, his Excellency Herr von Stantz Ettel, together with Frau Ettel, arrived in Tehran from Berlin. Within two days of his arrival the German Minister addressed a large gathering of the “ Arbeitsfront ” in the “ Brown House,” and warned his audience to read only the German official news and listen only to the German official wireless.Any who did otherwise were traitors to their country. He also told his audience to avoid neutrals! 6. Broadcasting. (i) Within recent weeks the daily broadcast in Persian from Angora has been seriously jammed by some unknown station. The Berlin broadcasts in Persian, as well as the Soviet (27 metre band—7 15 p.m. local time) are clearly heard. (ii) The Iranian broadcasting station which is expected to be ready within a few weeks is now carrying out tests to find a “ Golden Voice ” in modern Persian, and also announcers, either male or female, in the French, English, German, Russian and Arabic languages. 7. The Iranian State Railways. It is shortly expected that the line will be officially opened for traffic between Kerej and Qazvin. 8. Polish Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 6. On the 21st February, at Khorramshahr, his Excellency M. Jan Karszo Siedlewski, the Polish Minister who is accredited to Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, arrived from India. 9. Soviet-Iran Relations. The Soviet Ambassador and his military attache recently enquired from the Japanese and Italian Ministers and the Turkish Military Attache about military preparations in Iran. The German Charge d’Affaires also made similar enquiries from the Japanese Minister. The enquiries related to the possibility of Iran putting up any effective resistance if she were invaded by the Soviet, the object of recent military precau tions taken in Iran, the possible sources of supply of arms and ammunition to Iran, the quality of the Iranian army, the present relationship between the signatories of the Saadabad Pact (and particularly between Turkey and Iran) the numbers of British troops and aircraft in Iraq, and the reasons for General Weygand’s frequent visits to Turkey. ' In the course of his conversation with the Italian Minister, the Soviet Ambassador said : ‘ ‘ The people here are for us, but the Government is against us. Since the substance of these enquiries was bound to be repeated to this legation, it seems safe to assume that their object was merely that of alarming Iran and the Allies. H. J.

When these landing grounds have been completed aircraft are to be stationed there. 5. The Iranian State Railways. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), paragraph 8 . On the 8 th March the railway line between Tehran and Kazvin was officially declared open by his Excellency Dr. Matin Daftari, the Prime Minister, at the request of his Excellency Dr. Sajadi, Minister of Roads and Communications. The total distance between Tehran and Kazvin is 144 kilom. The journey takes four hours. The stations en route with kilometrage are as follows :— Tehran. Shahabad Kerej Gurdan Ashjard Ab-i-Ek Kavendeh Kazvin Kilom. 23 40 57 73 91 125 144 The line will not be available for public traffic for some weeks. 6 . Bulk Benzine Storage Tanks (A.I.O.C.). A list of certain of the main depots for the storage of benzine in bulk, with their capacity in gallons on several of the main strategic routes in Iran, are given in Appendix' A to this Intelligence Summary. ( x )3 The list is incomplete owing to the refusal of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to furnish any information of this nature. The list is otherwise correct. 7. Hungarian Interests. &lt; It is reliably reported that Count Laszlo Almasy, a Hungarian subject, explorer and airman, wishes to come to Iran to open a private flying school. 8 . German Interests. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), paragraph 5. On the 27th February, 1940. his Excellency Herr von Stantz Ettel, the new German Minister, was received in audience by His Imperial Majesty the Shah at the Gulistan Palace and presented his letters of credence. (ii) Berlin broadcasts in Persian are getting moi^e violent. The publication in the Iranian press of the true facts about the sinking of the steamship Aramestan (vide Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 5) caused a flood of abuse in the broadcast of the 4th March. (iii) Large quantities of goods, including cotton, wool, dried fruits and lambskins, are being sent to Germany via Batum and the Black Sea. Meat on hoof, fats and butter are also being collected in Khorasan, &amp;c., and taken over the Soviet frontier for despatch to Germany. (iv) German business-men continue to tender for all contracts. The latest tender is for the construction of ten factories, depots and refineries for the Ministry of Mines which is stated to be in the neighbourhood of 10 million reichsmarks. (v) About eighty D.Cav. motor cars have been imported from Germany. Twenty-eight of these have already been delivered at Bandar Pahlavi. One of these cars has been presented to His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince. The cars have been delivered without tyres. (vi) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), paragraph 5 . The German Minister continues to harangue his compatriots about their duty to the Fiihrer, &amp;c. He has forbidden all Aryan Germans to have anything to do with the numbers of German Jew refugees in Iran. Herr Alhardt, first secretary, and Major von Geldern Crespandorff. military attache, recently visited their nationals in Isfahan and Shiraz. 9. Italian Interests. (i) Radio Roma is to broadcast a weekly talk in modern Persian everv Monday evening commencing at 1905 hours (Tehran time) on the 19-4 metre band. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), paragraph 4 (ii). Ala Littoria Airways negotiations still continue. (iii) As a result of the arrival of Herr Ettel, the German Minister, Italian diplomats are being more careful to show at least outwardly their Axis friendship. 10. Trans-Caucasian Military A rea. Unconfirmed, but persistent, reports state that German air force personnel, anti-aircraft artillery gunners and other specialists have arrived in Baku and other localities in the Trans-Caucasian military area. The British Broadcasting Corporation also recently announced as uncon firmed news the arrival of two German divisions in this area. This, coming as it did from London, has caused increased anxiety amongst foreigners and Persians alike. 11. The Gas Mask Factory. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 23 of 1939, paragraph 7. Three German experts have recently arrived from Germany for employment at the gas mask factory at Wernak. 12. The Iranian Press. Once again the Iranian press is showing gross partiality by the increased publication of German news telegrams (Deutsches Nachrichten-Biiro). Havas and Reuters telegrams, too, are often mutilated and cut before publication.4 4 V 14. Census. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 13. On the 1st March a census of the population of Tehran and environs up to a radius of 6 kilom. was carried out. From 0500 hours to 2100 hours no one was permitted to leave their residence with the exception of’certain doctors and mid-wives. a result Tehran was like a city of the dead. Only an odd policeman or plain clothes detective could be observed in the deserted streets. The loss to shop keepers, cafe owners, &amp;c., is reported to have been very considerable. A week before the census day the authorities concerned carried out house- to-house visits and a detailed questionnaire was filled in and compared with passports, 'permis de sejour and identity documents. During census day His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by Dr. Matin Daftari, the Prime Minister, and the head of the Tehran Municipality. &amp;c., visited many different parts of the city to inspect municipal projects and improvements. The result of the first count of the census return shows that Tehran has a population of 531,246. It is said that many ex-Russian subjects, as well as Persians, were found without identity papers. * 15. The Iranian National Bank. The bank note circulation is to be increased by 1.500,000,000 rials. This amount is to be covered by part of the Crown jewels, which have now been deposited in the strong vaults of the Banque-i-Mellie (National Bank). An unconfirmed report states that all gold and silver reserves of the National Bank have been removed to places of security in South Iran. 16. The Aero Club of Iran. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 17. Negotiations for the purchase of Miles Magister dual control aircraft have broken down over the question of payment. The Aero Club desires to pay in local currency or barter exchange of Persian products. (ii) The first Persian girl to qualify for a pilot’s certificate is Mile. Ina Arshed. 17. Internal Security. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 of 1939. paragraph 6 . Several reports state that about the 6 th March judgment was given in the military court concerned with the trial of those arrested for alleged conspiracy. A number were sentenced to death by shooting, whilst in other cases sentences up to fifteen years’ imprisonment were inflicted. Six persons were acquitted, including both Amir Saham-ud-din Ghaffari (Zuka-ud-Dowleh) and M. A. Sepehr (Muvarakh- ed-Dowleh). 18. Iraqi Interests. For some considerable time the Iraqi Government have been trying to secure reciprocity from the Iranian Government in air mail service matters. The Iranian Government have tried to put them off with the excuse that a grant of such facilities would cause the Soviet Government to demand air facilities in Iran. This, however, is not clear since an Iranian air mail service does not go to Russia. The Iraqi Government have now come to an end of their patience and have informed the Iranian Government that unless reciprocal facilities are granted in Tehran the Iranian air mail service to Bagdad will have to be discontinued. The Iranian air mail service is run by the Iranian air force whilst an Iraqi service would be undertaken by a civil air-line. H. J UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

Tehran, March 27, 1940. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 6 for the Period ending March 23, 1940. 1 . The Imperial Family. (i) ON the 15th March the sixty-third anniversary of the birthday of His Imperial Majesty the Shah was celebrated throughout Iran. In Tehran a banquet, followed by a soiree, was given at the Gulistan Palace on the invitation of his Excellency M. Matin Daftari, the Prime Minister, and Mme Dattari, at which their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Prince and Princess Fowzieh, the Princess Shah Dakht Pahlavi and three of the younger Princes were present. All foreign military attaches were invited to the banquet ™ u ^ 1 w (ii) On the 20th March the Queen and Her Imperial Highness Shah Dukht Pahlavi left Tehran by special train for Qum, whence they proceeded by car on tour to Isfahan and Shiraz. , ^ ^ -d i (Hi) On the 21st March (Iranian New Year s Day) at the Gulistan Palace from 0800 hours till 1200 hours, His Imperial Majesty the Shah accompanied bv the Crown Prince, received the congratulations and good wishes of othcial delegations, both civil and military, and also those of the Diplomatic Corps. The doven of the corps, his Excellency Mohammed Nowruz Khan, the Afghan Ambassador, read a short address of good wishes for the New Year (1319) to which the Shah replied in a voice scarcely above a whisper. The fehah then walked round and shook hands with all members of the Diplomatic Corps. The Crown Prince followed behind his august father, but neither smiled nor shook hands nor spoke to anyone. The proceedings lasted only a few minutes. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 26 of 1939, paragraph 3 ( 1 ) His Excellency All Ashgar Hikmatt. Minister of the Interior (Military Attache s Personalities No. Ill—Foreign Office Personalities, No. 99), has resigned owing to continued ill-health. His resignation is a loss to the Imperial Government, as he was reputed to be an energetic and capable Minister. ■ (li) M Reza Hikmatt (Military Attache’s Personalities No. llz—Foieign Office Personalities, No. 100) has been appointed Governor of Kerman to fill an existing vacancy. He was formerly Governor of \ezd from 1935 to 1936. 3. The Iranian Budget. On the 3rd March the Minister of Finance, his Excellency Sarlashgar (Major-General) Amir Khosrovi, introduced his first budget for the Iranian year 1319 (the 21st March, 1940-20th March, 1941). This the Majlis have now passed. [4—78] TiThe budget (1939) is briefly as follows : — Rials. Total expenditure Total receipts Excess of expenditure over receipts 3,210,973,027 (£47.924,970) 3,094,393,377 (£46,184,984) 116,579,050 (£1.739,985) A comparison of items of military expenditure for the years 1318 and 1319 are as follows. No separate details of air force expenditure or naval are given :— Year 1318. Year 1319. Rials. Rials. Ministry of War 363,729,980 463,729.980 (£4,546,624) (£6,921,304) Gendarmerie 35,678,400 35,678,400 (£445,980) (£532,513) Conscription expenses 500,000 500,000 (£6,250) (£7,462) Purchase of cereals and forage for the army 16,000,000 21 , 000,000 (£ 200 , 000 ) (£313,432) Bandar Pahlavi, in which are included certain naval expenses 3,220,000 15,045,000 (£40,250) (£224,552) In addition, the Minister of Finance is authorised to spend an additional sum of £2 million out of reserves for military expenditure. The estimates for the Ministry of Industry and Mines reach the fantastic figures of 724,620,000 rials (£10,815,223), an increase of 296,190,000 rials (£4,420,761) over the figures for 1939-40 (Iranian year 1318-19i. The main items are as follows :— Spinning-mill and school for weaving ... Glycerine factory and soap factory Sugar factories Blast furnace and copper refinery and admini stration of mines Cement factories ... Caustic soda factory Nitric soda factory Rials. 42,000,000 (£626,8641 39,000,000 (£582,089) 147,000,000 (£2,194,029) 275,000,000 (£4,104,477) 46,000,000 (£686,567) 46,000,000 (£686,567) 23,000,000 (£343,284) To meet the deficit, the Ministry of Finance is authorised to make use of unforeseen receipts, surplus revenue from commercial enterprises of the State and by borrowing from banks in the country. It is undoubtedly a very optimistic budget prepared in a hurry by the Minister of Finance and a number of new officials whom he has brought into the Ministry, with the result that estimates both for receipts and expenditure have been carelessly compiled. Grave disappointment at the results are to be expected at the end of the year. Note. —Rates of conversion :— 1939- 40 : £1 = 80 rials. 1940- 41 : £1 = 67 rials.4. The Iranian Army. (i) Twelve new infantry regiments are being formed. The regimental commanders have been nominated, and each has been given a standard. Inis number, plus the original 39 infantry regiments, makes a total ot ol mtantry ^^regiments, which equals 17 divisions at the normal establishment of 3 regiments ^ per division. , . , (ii) Divisional headquarters of all new divisions are located m the towns from which they take their names. The Gilan Divisional Headquarters, however, is at Resht, the provincial capital. It is reported that one of the Kermanshah brigades will be stationed at Hamadan. . (iii) Earthworks (strong points, sangars with barbed-wire obstacles) have been constructed at the following points :— Mughanni : North of Miskin Shahr (Khiav) (million sheet No. 1, square D 2). Alamdar : 8 kilom. south of Julfa (million sheet No. 1, square B 2 ). Kara Tappeh (million sheet No. 1, square A 1). Arablar (million sheet No. 1, square B 1). (iv) The Turkish Military Attache has been requested by the Shah to submit his criticisms of the Tehran garrison manoeuvres held in September last year. (v) Infantry Regiment No. 33 (Zabuli) has not been transferred to Bujnurd. (vi) On the 18th March a number of medical students and other specialists were released from army service to continue their studies. (vii) At the news of the conclusion of the Irano-Soviet Commercial Agree ment there were strong rumours that certain classes of reservists would i&gt;e demobilised. There is, however, no confirmation of this. (viii) Equipment and small arms continue to be sent to all new divisions. 5. The Iranian Air Force. (i) An unconfirmed report states that aerodromes are to be constructed at the following places, and that the Soviet air force may have the use of these aerodromes if and when required :— 1 . Safiddava : Near Kuh-i-Malik Siah (million sheet No. 30, square A 2). 2. Khwash (million sheet No. 30, square B 4). 3. Jandak (million sheet No. 16, square C 2). 4. Resht (million sheet No. 8 , square B 3). 5. Gurgan (million sheet No. 15, square C 4). 6 . Bandar Rig (million sheet No. 10, square C 3). 7. Ahwaz (million sheet No. 10, square A 1). (ii) The latest information on certain aerodromes and landing grounds in Tehran and the provinces are given as an appendix to this Intelligence Summary. 6 . Iranian Commercial Interests. It is reported that the honorary commercial attaches at London, Berlin and New York are shortly to be replaced by permanent diplomatic commercial repre sentatives as follows :— London : M. Hajir. Berlin : M. Nasr. New York : Maqbil. 7. British Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 7. The state ment that “ Sardar Sahib ” Sahib Singh had given a donation of 6,000 rupees to the British Red Cross Society, although quoted in the British official news, has been found to be premature and incorrect. 8 . French Interests. Professor Dr. Oberling has been appointed Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in the Tehran University. Professor Oberling has requested wide powers, and in particular a free hand with the administration of Government civil hospitals. It is stated that His Imperial Majesty the Shah has approved his requests which [4—78] ' ' b 24 * will do much to improve the efficiency ol the hospitals and inciease iiench influence. The Iranian press of the 20th March stated that Government civil hospitals were to be handed over by the Department of Public Health to the Ministry of Education. Polish (i) His Excellency M. Jan Karszo-Siedlewski, the Polish Minister returned to Tehran from India via Bombay and Khorramshahr on the 14th March, (ii) Difficulty was experienced in obtaining an official invitation tor tne Polish representative to the banquet held in the Gulistan Palace on the bhah s birthday (15th March). It appears that the Turkish Ambassador who is good natured and easy going, was persuaded to deliver a message to the 1 olish Oharge d’Affaires that to invite a Polish representative would be most embarrassing tor the Iranian Government. As a result the Irench, British, Belgian, Iraqi, Egyptian and American representatives declared their intention of declining to attend the banquet should a Polish representative not be present. The Turkish Ambassador, too, changed his views and acted energetically as a go between. This united front shook the Iranian Government to such an extent that orders were issued to cancel the dinner. Before, however, written notices to this effect could be sent out it was decided to hold the dinner and to invite Polish representatives. . Had the Turkish Ambassador acted with energy and common sense in the first place by reminding the Iranian Government of their obligations under inter national law, and also that Iran was a member of the Council of the League of Nations such a situation ought never to have arisen. (ii) M. Leon Malinowski, a Polish engineer in the employ of the Afghan Government at Herat, is now visiting I ehran. (iii) M. Swiatkowski, a Polish reserve engineer officer formerly in the employ of the Afghan Government, recently passed through Tehran to join the Polish brigade now being formed in Syria. 10. Egyptian Interests. (i) It is stated in Egyptian circles that his Excellency M. Yussuf Zulficar Pasha, the Egyptian Ambassador, is expected to return shortly to his post. (ii) There are rumours that their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Prince and Princess Fowzieh will proceed on a visit to Egypt this summer. 11. Italian Interests. (i) The Italian Minister, Signor Petrucci, accompanied by his daughter and Mme. Mola, English wife of the Italian Naval and Air Attache, visited Isfahan, Shiraz and Bushire during the period under review. At Shiraz they encountered the German Military Attache’s party, and hurriedly declined an invitation to stay at His Majesty’s Consulate. It has been noticed for some time past that the Italians are particularly careful to be pro-Axis. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 5 (current), paragraph 9. The first Italian broadcast in Persian is stated by the Italian Naval and Air Attache not to have been successful as the Persian spoken by the announcer was that spoken in India and Afghanistan. An urgent telegram has been despatched to Rome in this connexion. 12. German Interests. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 5 (current), paragraph 8 (vi). While in Shiraz Major von Geldern Crespandorff and Dr. Alhardt, first secretary, endeavoured to obtain the release of Herr Robert Renner, who has been in strict confinement since November last. In this, however, they were unsuccessful as the police had removed Herr Renner in custody to Tehran. (ii) The German Military Attache left Tehran on the 22nd March, 1940, for a tour of the Caspian provinces as well as Azerbaijan. (iii) During the Imperial Birthday and New Year celebrations the German Legation was flood-lit. (iv) There are very strong rumours that the German Minister, in a recent audience with His Imperial Majesty the Shah, offered to guarantee Iran’s immunity from attack by Russia, and asked that in return the Shah should show5 some preference for Germany—of what nature is not stated. The Shah is said to have given a very guarded reply, declaring his intention to maintain neutrality. (v) It is stated on reliable authority that an organisation under the auspices of the German Foreign Office exists in Afghanistan of representatives of Moslem ^tricts in Russia, who are engaged in working out schemes for creating internal tTouble in the Soviet Union. Bokhara, Khiva, Samarkand and Erghana are said to be disaffected and ripe for revolt. 13. Hungarian Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 5 (current), paragraph 7. It appears that Count Almasy wishes to enlist the personal influence of King Farouk of Egypt with the Shah for his scheme for a flying school in Iran. It is understood that the scheme would be discouraged both by His Majesty’s Legation at Bucharest and His Majesty’s Embassy at Cairo, and in any case it is unlikely that it would be approved by the Shah. So far nothing has been heard of the scheme in Iran. 14. Soviet Interests. (i) On the 14th March it was officially announced in the Iranian press that a commercial treaty had been concluded and initialled at Moscow by representa tives of Iran and the Soviet Union. The signing of the treaty will take place shortly in Tehran. Iranian official circles express considerable pleasure at the news and the Foreign Minister, his Excellency M. Muzaffar ATam has openly boasted that, since his taking over of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, negotiations have proceeded smoothly and been brought to a successful conclusion. He has also stated that he was pleased, firstly, because it was a pact with Russia, and also that it would be the second Russian pact that he personally would sign. (He had signed one as Minister of Trade.) The Shah has decorated the Foreign Minister with the First-Class Order of the Humayun. . . . . (ii) All ex-Russian subjects in Iran are to be issued at once with identity papers and will not be obliged to report to the police as heretofore. (iii) As a result of the Soviet-Iran Commercial Treaty many goods have been lowered in price in the bazaars, viz., tea. lamp glass, cotton piece-goods. &amp;c. 15. The Steamship Aramistan. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 5. The reason for not publishing at once the news of the torpedoing of the steamship Aramistan was that no one dared to tell the Shah that it carried sugar and rails for Iran. When His Majesty’s Minister’s letter was received at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the “ fat was in the fire ” and the Shah had to be informed. It is said that when unpleasant news has to be told to the Shah, it is left to Haji Reza Rafi (Maqan-ul-Mulk), who is in effect the Court Jester! 16. The Iranian Press. Fditorials have recently appeared in the official Ittela’at, entitled “The Solidarity of Oriental Peoples,” “The Unity of the Orient.” These articles are probably intended to reassure Iranians reading of the Irano-Soviet pact that Trail has not thereby entered the Russian orbit and abandoned the Saadabad policy. A further editorial, dated the 21st March, was entitled “ Hypocritical Compli ments ” This may refer to the fulsome and nauseating praise and flattery of His Imperial Majesty the Shah and Iran from the Berlin broadcasts in Persian during the Imperial'Birthday and New Year celebrations. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache. Tehran, March 23. 1940.(No. 107. Secret.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 7 for the period ending the 6 th April, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, April 9, 1940. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 7 for the period ending April 6 , 1940. 1. The Shah. ON the 26th March, His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by a small suite, which included three General Staff Officers, left the capital by special train for Ahwaz. At all the larger stations where the Imperial train was scheduled to halt all local Government officials had to be present, whether by night or day, in case they were required. At Ahwaz the Shah was received by the Ustandar and Sarlashgar (Major-General) Shahbakhti, General Officer Commanding 6 th (Khuzistan) Division. Large crowds gathered at the railway station and the streets to greet His Majesty. On the 28th and the 29th March, the Shah carried out on foot a very thorough, but fatiguing inspection of all public works, &amp;c., in Ahwaz. Further orders for the progressive and constructional development of the city were given, especially in the area on the left bank of the Karun river, and between the two bridges. There is no doubt that as a result of the railway and this reconstruction the importance of Ahwaz is growing rapidly. Land values are already soaring in price. On the 30th March His Imperial Majesty the Shah left by road for Marou (18 kilom. from Khorramshahr), where he embarked on the Imperial Iranian naval ship Simorgh, and continued his journey to Khorramshahr. At Khorramshahr he was received by the senior naval authorities and took up residence at the Naval Officers’ Club. In the afternoon the Shah inspected the naval barracks and depots, and embarked on the Homay to visit the naval college. In the evening His Majesty walked about Khorramshahr for about two hours. On the 31st March His Imperial Majesty visited Abadan, where he inspected the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s refineries and other buildings. He was received by the general manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and other senior officials. This is only the second occasion in his reign that the Shah has visited the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s plant. Later His Majesty inspected the garrison who marched past. On the 1st April His Imperial Majesty the Shah left Khorramshahr on the Iranian sloop Babr for Bandar Shahpur. On entering that port the sloops Palang and Shahbaz fired a salute of twenty-one guns. The Shah disembarked and then carried out a thorough inspection of the port. It is gratifying to note that the first shipment of steel rails from England was being unloaded from the steamship Bandar Shahpur at the time of the Imperial visit. On the 2 nd April the Shah left by the Imperial train for Tehran, which was reached on the morning of the 3rd April. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Minister that the Shah while at Ahwaz had given orders for the construction of a broad railway line from Ahwaz to Khorramshahr, on the ground that since an embankment was essential to protect the road from floods it might as well carry a railway. [4—153]9 ( x ) Not printed. 2. The Imperial Family. On the 20th March, Her Imperial Majesty the Queen, accompanied by Princess Shah Dukht Shams Pahlavi, arrived at the Bagh-i-Delgusha in Shiraz, former seat of the Qavam-ul-Mulk. For some weeks past electricians and plumbers had been busy installing electric light, baths and modern conveniences into this building in preparation for the Imperial guests. The Shiraz ladies, including the Qavam-ul-Mulk’s sister, were waiting at the main gate of the Bagh-i-Delgusha to welcome the Queen, but the Imperial cars swept past the lot without the slightest notice or acknowledgment. The Imperial visit was as usual nothing but a series of unkept appointments and bad manners. On “ Non Ruz ' (Iranian New Year’s Day), officers of the Shiraz garrison and officials in full dress uniform were kept waiting for over two hours at the tomb of Hafiz all to no purpose. The Queen’s visit to the Shiraz museum also was six hours late. On the journey to Shiraz the school children of Isfahan dressed in new clothes, which their parents had had to provide, stood for hours in the streets and were rewarded by seeing a closed car flash swiftly by. The main roads, too, were closed to all traffic from the afternoon of the day previous to the Royal passage. Thus does the Pahlavi dynasty endear itself to the hearts of its loyal peoples. On the 30th March Her Imperial Majesty the Queen and Princess Shah Dukht returned to Isfahan, where they spent two days visiting some of the more interesting and historic buildings, finally returning to Tehran on the 1st April. 3. Iranian Officials. Haji Reza Rafi (Maqam-ul-Mulk) who is in effect the Court jester, is no longer persona grata, and was dismissed from the Court on the 3rd April. In this connexion, see Intelligence Summary No. 6 (current), paragraph 13. 4. I'he Iranian A rmy. (i) In accordance with the Conscription Law. Conscription Committees throughout the country commenced their formal examination of conscripts due to be called up for training next year. (ii) Negotiations for the purchase of forty-eight guns (75-mm. mountain), Schneider or Bofors under licence, have begun with Messrs. Cockerill, of Belgium. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 6 (current), paragraph 4 (ii). It is now considered that the locality Muganni is probably the Moghan Steppe (million sheet No. 1 , square D 1 ), and not as indicated. (iv) Since the signing of the Irano-Soviet Commercial Treaty and the “ Nou Ruz '’ holidays, there has been a considerable slackening in military activity and preparations. (v) As no reserve supplies of boots exist in the country, a project is on foot for the immediate construction of two army boot factories capable of producing 400,000 pairs of boots a year. 5. The Iranian Air Force. ' (i) Negotiations are reliably reported to be proceeding favourably in the United States for purchase of twenty fighter aircraft. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 6 (current), paragraph 5 (ii). Further information on certain landing grounds in the provinces is given as an appendix^) to this summary. 6 . The Iranian Navy. Five Italian specialists are still under contract with the Iranian naval forces of the south based on Khorramshahr, viz., one wireless expert, three engineers and one deep-sea diver. 7. French Interests^ 2k. M. Jerome Thdraud, novelist and academician, has recently been visiting Tehran. He is connected with the Paris Soir.3 (*) Not printed. 8 . United States Interests. Structural steel of all sorts has been ordered for Iran from the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, of America. The price is stated to be just under $1 million. Soviet Interests. Soon after the signing of the Irano-Soviet Commercial Treaty, twenty persons imprisoned on charges of communism, &amp;c., were released and ninety-two others connected with Russia have had their sentences substantially reduced. The press, however, did not indicate any connexion between the treaty and this act of clemency, nor did it mention the nature of the offences of which the prisoners had been found guilty. 10. Polish Interests. For reasons of economy the Polish Consulates at Bagdad and Kabul are being closed down. The Polish Legation at Tehran is, however, being retained. 11. Italian Interests. An Italian journalist, David Massimo, special correspondent of the news paper Gazette del Pofulo, of Turin, recently arrived in Tehran. During the Spanish war he was attached to General Franco’s staff as a war correspondent. Massimo is despatching telegrams in Italian to his news editor attacking Allied policy in Iraq and Iran. Much of what he sends is quoted by the Berlin broadcast in Persian. He is frequently in the company of Renato Giardini, first secretary of the Italian Legation, and an Italian suspect named Gabella, a tennis professional. Whilst in Iraq, Massimo was detained by the police for enquiry. In one of his telegrams Massimo accuses the censorship authorities at Haifa of writing facetious notes in letters opened in the course of their duty and quotes two cases, one an Italian woman’s letter and one Dutch. Massimo intends visiting /^Afghanistan in the near future. His Italian passport number is 618008, issued at Rome on the 29th January, 1940. 12. German Interests. (i) Extracts from the German White Paper No. 2 on the causes leading up to the war, pp. 162-163, proof No. 245, are given as an appendix to this summary^ 1 ) (ii) According to a reliable report from the German Legation itself, there are 1,700 Germans resident in Iran. A number of Czechs and about sixty-five Austrians living in Iran have refused to register at the German Legation. Threats are being used to compel them to register. (iii) German travellers complain greatly of the inexplicable delays caused to them in Russia. It now takes an average of six days to reach Baku from Germany. A party of seventy Iranian students destined for Germany have been held up in Bandar Pahlavi for days awaiting accommodation on the Russian railways. These students on return are to be employed in the Kerej blast-furnaces. (iv) An official from the German Ministry of Industry, Herr Waltei; Jack Graewer, has recently arrived on a special mission. It is said that he intends visiting Kabul. (v) Two agricultural experts have recently arrived in Tehran at the instance of the German Minister to discuss the possibility of cultivating the castor-oil plant in Iran. The German Government is stated to have opened substantial credits for this purpose. Given a favourable climate and weather, it is considered possible that the first harvest of castor oil could be made in six to eight months' time. (vi) Negotiations are in progress for the exchange of 20,000 tons of rice for guns and ammunition from Germany. (vii) Major Graf von Spee, from General Headquarters in Germany, recently visited Tehran on a special mission. He has returned to Berlin via Russia.14 Tehran Census. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 5 (current), paragraph 14. The second scrutiny of census returns reveals that the population of Tehran is 540,047 persons. According to the Bureau of National Statistics, a census was held in Tehran in 1884, when the figures were 106,482. A second census took place in 1892, when' an increase was recorded, the total being 160,000. A third census carried out in 1923 showed 210,000 and a fourth in 1932 showed a further increase to 310,139. H. J. UNDERWOOD, L ieutenant-Colonel.

Intelligence Summary No. 8 for the Period ending Ayril 20, 1940. (Secret.) 1 . The Shah and the Imperial Family. HIS Imperial Majesty and the Imperial family remained in residence at the Imperial Palace in Tehran during the period under review. The Shah on two occasions personally inspected on foot the progress of building and other city improvements in the neighbourhood of the palaces. On the 18th April a son was born to Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, wife of Ali Muhammad Qawam. Their marriage took place in March 1937. This is the Shah’s first Imperial grandchild. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) His Excellency M. Hamid Sayyah (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 259; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 183) has been appointed Director- General at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 6 (current), paragraph 2 (ii). An unconfirmed report states that his Excellency Ali Asghar Hikmat, late Minister of the Interior, may be appointed Minister at Berlin. It is now said that the real reason for Hikmat’s recent resignation was a difference of opinion about the handing over of hospitals from the Ministry of the Interior (Department of Public Health) to the Ministry of Education (Intelligence Summary No. 6 (current), paragraph 8 , refers). 3. Iranian Army. (i) Reports from Khuzistan state that His Imperial Majesty the Shah spent a considerable time with the military authorities. He was not apparently satisfied with the work of the General Officer Commanding, 6 th (Khuzistan) Division, Sarlashgar (Major-General) Shahbakhti, finding fault in particular with {a) the quality of the rations issued to the troops; ( 6 ) the dirty and ragged turn-out of the air force personnel; (c) and the fact that no attempts had been made to construct protective bunds at the Ahwaz military aerodrome, with the result that the aerodrome was flooded and the available area reduced to a strip 400 yards long by 100 yards broad. The Air Officer Commanding, No. 4 Regiment, Sarhang-i-ekum (Lieutenant-Colonel) Zanyaneh was degraded on the spot and sent to Tehran. Sargord (Major) Gilanshahi is now officiating air officer commanding. (ii) A consular report from Tabriz states that a division is being formed at Khoi, but all available reports refute the suggestion that this division will consist only of cavalry. The Maku garrison will form part of this division. On the other hand, a well-known cavalry officer, Sarhang (Colonel) Mekelzade, and several other cavalry officers were sent to Khoi over six weeks ago to organise this division. [5—56] RECOv POL. DEPtv SUlAY 940 INDIA OFFICE2 Since the signing of the Irano-Soviet Commercial Agreement work on the expansion of the Iranian army has been very much slowed down, if it is not altogether stopped. (iv) It is stated that the German Legation has arranged for the sale ol 200,000 Polish rifles to the Imperial Government. . . , ^ . (v) The Iranian military authorities have been making enquiries from the Japanese as to whether guns, small arms and ammunition of all sorts can be purchased in Japan. (vi) Sartip (Brigadier) Reza Quli Khan Rukni, General Officer Commanding Isfahan Division, has been relieved of his command. 4. The Iranian Air Force. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 6 , paragraph 5, (i). The unconfirmed and doubtful report that the Iranian Government had agreed in case of war to allow the Soviet air force the use of certain aerodromes in Iran remains still unconfirmed, although both the Italian Naval Attache and the French Military Attache are of the opinion that a secret protocol was signed between Iran and the U.S.S.R. at the time of the signature of the Irano-Soviet Commercial Agreement containing something to this effect. Three of the aero dromes mentioned in Intelligence Summary No. 6 , viz., Nos. 2, 4, 5, Khwash, (Resht) Bandar Pahlavi, and Gurgan, are now undergoing reconstruction. Efforts are still being continued to discover the facts. (ii) Two hundred to 250 workmen under the supervision of Iranian air force personnel are engaged in extending and levelling the Bandar Pahlavi (Kazian) landing ground. (iii) The boundaries of the Shiraz aerodrome have recently been marked with petrol tins placed at 15-yard intervals, and riding or walking across the ground is no longer permitted. (iv) The Persepolis emergency landing ground has been ploughed up. (v) A Tabriz consular report states that landing grounds exist at the following places, but no details are available : Ardebil, Zinjan, Julfa, Khoi, Maku, Rezaieh. (vi) A consular report states that a new landing ground with a large hangar is to be constructed at Khwash. (vii) The present state of the Isfahan landing ground is as follows : — The surface is firm and in good order except for the south-east corner which has been badly rutted by flood water. The boundaries are inconspicuously marked by petrol tins placed at irregular- intervals of 100 yards to 150 yards, except on the east side where the tins have disappeared. The white circle in the middle of the ground has become discoloured and the word “ Isfahan ” in Roman letters formed by whitewashed bricks inside the circle has been erased and replaced by “Isfahan” in Persian characters scrawled in chalk. A wind-sleeve flies at the north-west corner of the ground. 5. Iranian Navy. (i) Sarhang Ghulam AH Bayendor (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 66 ; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 5) was promoted to Daryadar (rear-admiral) at the New Year. (ii) During his recent visit to Khurramshahr His Imperial Majesty the Shah, while inspecting the naval hospital, dismissed and sent to jail Sargord (Major) Rokini, the naval doctor, for his lack of interest and ill-treatment of naval patients. (iii) The harbour at Nou Shahr (map, degree sheet 8 P, C 2) is ready for handing over to the Iranian Government. 6 . Iranian State Railways. (i) The railw'ay college at Tehran now has 64 students, 33 in the technical branch, 22 in the Stores and Supply Department, and 9 in the Survey Depart ment. The course at this college normally lasts two years. It is under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Communications and has several foreign instructors. (ii) The railway has been officially opened as far as Takistan (Siahdahan) 35 kilom. west of Qazvin (map, degree sheet 8 H, C 4). This village is surrounded by rich fertile land and is the property of His Imperial Majesty the Shah.3 ^33) 7. Iraqi Interests. The Iraqi Government are negotiating with the Imperial Government for the use of the road from Mosul and Rowanduz to Tabriz by an Iraqi motor transport concern. The point at issue is the question of whether Iraqi drivers should he allowed to enter Iran with their cars and vice versa. ^ M. Luigi Pennachio, second secretary of the Italian Legation, has asked the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires whether the rumour of a transport route between these towns was correct, as it would seriously compete with the Italian sea route from Trieste to Bandar Shahpur! It seems most probable that the Italians were seeking military information for the Germans, who would naturally wish to know whether a road was to be brought into use by which Allied troops could reach Tabriz quickly. M. Pennachio has been for many years in the Middle East and once was at &lt; the Italian Legation in Kabul. 8 German Interests. (i) The German Minister has lately been visiting in alphabetical order all German business houses and offices in Tehran. He has issued orders that all German nationals in Iran must be properly organised into groups of ten under a leader : ten groups to be under the orders of a chief, and the whole to be under the command of the “ Gauleiter,” Herr Krauter, an attache at the German Legation. The German Legation has, it is said, rented a large park at Shimran with two swimming pools. Germans will be detailed to take part in physical training, &amp;c., twice weekly in this park. Their group leaders are to be responsible for their regular attendance. A number of Germans have been obliged to take riding lessons at the former Lessman riding school. (ii) The Germans are meeting with obstruction and difficulties from the Russians in their exportation from Iran of cotton and wool. Soviet ships are still returning in ballast to Baku. The Russians are pretending that there is serious congestion at the ports of Batum and Baku. The same thing is happening on the Julf-Tiflis-Batum route. (iii) A pro-Ally Belgian subject M. Embrechts, wireless expert and chief representative of Messrs. Standard Telephone Company, Antwerp, reports that the chief German wireless operator at the German Legation, Herr Heuss, recently asked him for information as to how daily weather reports could be procured for Iran and Iraq. Apparently the German Legation has been ordered to supply such reports without fail. The German operators can easily obtain the weather reports signalled to British, &amp;c., aircraft flying to India but are in difficulties about Iraq and Iran. Iraqi weather reports are usually received three days late, presumably obtained from the Italians. The Italian Naval and Air Attache recently also enquired from the British Military Attache whether there was any Iranian meteorological service. (iv) Many Iranian police officials are reputed to be in the pay of the Germans as well as influential officials in the Censorship Bureau. (v) The following changes have taken place recently among the German instructors at the Iranian technical schools in the provinces. Herr Wulfi, head of the technical school at Isfahan, to Tabriz. Herr Kraemer from Tabriz to Shiraz and Herr Ettel Gnadt, an ex-German air force officer, to Isfahan. 9 . Turkish Interests. The accountant-general of the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, M. Abdul Kadir, has lately visited Tehran in connexion with the formal taking over of the new Turkish Embassy buildings. He has openly stated that he personally has formed a bad impression of the present attitude of Iran towards Turkey, especially since the conclusion of the Irano-Soviet Commercial Treaty. M. Abdul Kadir stated also that in his opinion Iran had by this done an act of cowardice behind Turkey’s back and should not now be considered well disposed to the Allies. It is interesting to note that on the 15th April an effusive article appeared in the official IttUaat newspaper praising the eternal union and brotherhood of the Imperial Government and that of Turkey, and asserting that these two countries would aid each other in the face of every eventuality.4 10. Italian Interests. (i) The Italian journalist, David Massimo, has returned to Italy via Ahwaz and Basra, where he boarded an Ala Littoria aircraft. According to the Italian Naval and Air Attache, Commander Mola, Massimo was searched by the British authorities on landing at Haifa, and a letter addressed to Commander Mola’s father, Admiral (retired) Mola, was seized. . (ii) Negotiations between the Iranian Government and Ala Littoria Airlines have ceased. After the signing of the Irano-Soviet Commercial Agreement the Imperial Government told the Italians they were no longer interested. 11. Dutch Interests. His Excellency Baron Frangois Van Aerssen Beyeren, the new Dutch Minister, presented his letters of credence to His Imperial Majesty the Shah at a special audience granted in the Gulistan Palace on the 9th April. Baron Beyeren has been Dutch Consul-General at Hamburg for the past ten years. 12. Soviet Interests. (i) No Soviet merchandise has been imported from Russia since the signing of the commercial agreement. This has caused rumours in the bazaars, stating that the Russians are waiting until the Imperial Government fulfils its secret obligations before despatching goods to Iran. (ii) Unconfirmed reports state that the former Russian hospital in Tehran is to be reopened, as well as hospitals in Isfahan and Tabriz. (iii) The school for Russian-speaking children in Tehran has been reopened. 13 Aero Club. (i) Seventeen pupil pilots are being trained to fly at the Meshed aerodrome by military pilots who are members also of the Aero Club of Iran. (ii) According to the press a new aerodrome is being prepared by members of the Aero Club at Sakiz (million sheet 1 , C 4). 14. Changes in Place Names. A list of place names in Iran whose names have been changed is given as an Appendix( x ) to this Summary. 15. Foreigners. The Iranian Foreign Minister, M. Mumtaz (assistant head of the Protocol Department) and General Mukhtar (chief of police) have all admitted that there is at police headquarters a list of nearly 15,000 foreigners resident in Iran who can be ordered to leave the country at a moment’s notice. Recently several German Jew refugee families have been forced to leave Iran. 16. Broadcasting. (i) The Soviet Military Attache (Colonel Alexandrov) has confirmed in writing that there are no Soviet broadcasts in Persian. The Erivan and Baku stations, however, relay programmes from Moscow in Armenian and Turki respectively. (ii) The official opening of the Tehran broadcasting station will take place on the 24th April. The wave-lengths are: medium 335-2, and short 19-87 or 30-99. (iii) The German Persian broadcast continues to do harm to the Allies’ cause as it is without effective opposition. 17. Anglo-lranian Oil Company. During his visit to the refinery at Abadan His Imperial Majesty the Shah took the greatest interest in (a) the training, especially manual, given in the Anglo-lranian Oil Company technical school; (5) the facilities given them for recreation; {c) the wages paid to apprentices together with deductions for board. &amp;c.; (d) the number of Iranian nationals employed in responsible positions in the company. It was apparent that the Shah was pleased with the degree of Iranisation attained by the company and with the training given. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache.

Tehran, May 8 , 1940. iti»&amp;' i Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 9 for the Period ending May 4, 1940. 1 . The Shah and, the Imperial Family. ON the 28th April His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, formally opened the Sixth Annual Exhibition of National Products. The Shah spent over two hours closely examining the exhibits. On the 30th April His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by their Imperial Highnesses the Princes Ali Reza. Ghulam Reza and Abdul Reza Pahlavi, left by train for Mazanderan. 2. Iranian Officials. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 8 (current), paragraph 2 (ii). His Excellency Ali Asghar Hikmat has been reinstated as Minister of the Interior. 3. Iranian Army. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 3 (ii). Reserve Class 1294 (1916) has completed its training and has been discharged. Reserve Class 1292 (1914) is now undergoing training. The remaining three classes have been called up successively for one month’s training each. (ii) It is now reported as extremely doubtful whether the 2nd Cavalry Division at Kuchan and the 3rd Cavalry Division at Khoi will ever be concen trated and formed as cavalry divisions. (iii) New cavalry barracks are being built at Gumbad-i-Kabus (million sheet 15 D 3). Eventually a cavalry regiment will be stationed there. 4. 7/ ‘anian Air Force. (i) The service aerodromes at Mehrabad and Qila Murgha (Tehran area) are both being rapidly extended and improved. Doshanteppeh, the civil airport, is also being enlarged and is to be equipped with a control tower, waiting rooms and a restaurant. (ii) The first of the new hangars at Ahwaz aerodrome is to be completed within the next month. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are responsible for the construction of these hangars. (iii) The news that after all three (Mk. I) Blenheim bombers are to be delivered to Iran forthwith, and possibly a further nine after the next two months, has greatly heartened the Iranian air force authorities, as well as General Nakhchevan, the Acting Minister of War. RECik POL, DEPt, \ ZJUN 940 INDIA OFFICE'2 (iv) The American Charge d’Affaires has been approached by the Iranian Government with an enquiry as to whether American personnel could be engaged to replace the British at present employed on aircraft construction in Tehran. It is suspected that this enquiry has been made in response to Soviet pressure. 5. Iranian Nary. (i) Daryadar (Rear-Admiral) Ali Bayendor is drawing up a plan based on the Basra Port Regulations to levy port dues at Bandar Shahpur. If this comes into force, it will be awkward for the German shipping now anchored there, but it is also presumed that it is in preparation for the large numbers of ships which may ultimately use the proposed Anglo-Iranian Oil Company port at Bandar Mashur. (ii) Sargard (Major) Ghulam Hussein Bayendor has been promoted to the rank of Sarhang (Naval Captain) and is to be transferred to Tehran. (iii) According to a consular report, a large quantity of military equipment, including guns from Germany, was recently unloaded from the Italian ship Casaregis. The ship’s papers had been passed by the British Contraband Control. 6 . British Interests. British firms have been active in tendering for various Government contracts in Iran, such as woollen machinery (Messrs. Platts), generating plant (Metropolitan-Vickers), wireless sets and sugar-making machinery. Messrs. Bayer Peacock of Manchester have been given a contract for twenty-four Santa Fe type locomotives. The United Steel Company, who have a contract for the supply of 72,000 tons of steel rails, worth £850,000, have been asked to supply 128,000 tons more, worth £1,600,000, at the special request of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. It is doubtful whether this additional quantity can be released. A contract for 25,000 tons of cement has also been placed in the United Kingdom, and 25,000 tons in India. 7. United States Interests. On the 29th April Colonel Henry C. MacLean, United States Army, passed through Tehran on his way to the United States via Iraq, Syria and Egypt. Colonel MacLean has been appointed Chief of Staff of the Vth United States ‘’i Army Corps on completion of his tenure of appointment in the Philippines. He ■] toured Burma, India (North-West Frontier Province) and Afghanistan before reaching Tehran. Colonel MacLean was loud in his praises of the army in India. 8 . Tehran Broadcasting Station. The inauguration ceremony of the Tehran broadcasting station took place on the evening of the 24th April in the presence of His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince. The following are some details of this station :— Transmitters. ( 1 ) A medium-wave transmitter E.Q.A. of 2 kilowatts’ power, adaptable over a range of 250-350 metres, operating on a frequency of 335-2 metres, or 895 kilocycles for the Tehran district. (2) A short-wave transmitter of 14 kilowatts’ power adaptable over a range of 14 to 80 metres for abroad and the provinces; operating on the following frequencies :— E.Q.B. : 19 -87 metres or 15,100 megacycles. E.Q.C. : 30-99 metres or 9,680 megacycles. The hours of broadcasting are :— 11.30-14.00 local time (08.00-10.30 G.M.T.). 17.15-23.30 local time (17.15-20.00 G.M.T.). The short-wave transmitter can also be used for wireless telegraphy and telephony. Power for telegraphic purposes is 34 kilowatts. The apparatus is supplied by Telefunken. Two further short-wave transmitters are being erected by Messrs. Standard Telephones and Cables (Limited), whose chief engineer is M. Embrechts, a Belgian subject. Twelve subsidiary medium wave transmitters are also being erected in the provinces for regional purposes.N 3 News is given in Persian, Arabic, Turkish, French, Russian, English and German. The Turkish, French and German announcers are women. Loud-speakers have been erected in several of the squares in Tehran, which attract large audiences. The Tehran radio does not stick strictly to its published time-table. A news '^bulletin may begin before the advertised time if the preceding item has been short. The order of items are altered too without announcement. The English and French bulletins consist entirely of Havas and Reuters news items with an occasional neutral one. The German bulletin consists equally entirely of D.N.B. telegrams. Steps are being taken to have this station’s programmes regularly monitored. 9. German Interests. (i) The German military attache, Major von Geldern Crespandorff, carried out a reconnaissance in the Kermanshah area on the 23rd and 24th April. He visited the Kermanshah aerodrome and was later seen near the Qara Su bridge close to the Kermanshah Petroleum Company’s refinery, where he spent some minutes gazing at the plant. (ii) A Dr. Erwin Gauba, employed at the agricultural farm at Karej, has openly stated that he is resigning in the autumn to take up a post as an agricultural expert in one of the German colonies Avhich will have been restored to Germany by that time. (iii) Considerable numbers of Germans are now in Tehran. In spite of the assurance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it is extremely difficult to obtain visas, it is apparent that in practice the police grant visas freely to Germans. (iv) Several Iranian motor firms have been importing cars of German make. These are 30 “ Wanderer,” 10 D.K.W. (two-stroke, front wheel drive), and 30 Mercedes-Benz. 10. Irano-Soviet Commercial Agreement. It is reliably reported that there are 14 million marks’ worth of German goods for Iran held up at Batum. The Soviet authorities state that they have no transport available. It is also said that 20 million marks’ worth of goods are ready at factories in Germany, but no transport can be arranged. The Iranians are not exporting anything to Russia, except against imports. Recently editorials have been published in the official press, complaining that goods are not being delivered, and stating that if a country under one pretext or another could not furnish Iran with the goods she needed according to agree ments made, that country could not expect Iran to turn to it for such goods as she required. It is considered that these press attacks are directed in the main against Russia. It has been asserted that the commercial treaty was accompanied by an agree ment placing Iranian landing-grounds at the disposal of Soviet Russia in certain circumstances. Such an agreement would be no new thing, since it would only be a particular application of the right accorded to Russia under article 6 of the Russo-Persian Treaty of the 26th February, 1921, to send forces into Persia if a third Power should introduce forces into Iran to make it a base of operations against Russia. At the time of the signature of the commercial treaty, both Russia and Germany were very anxious about the possibility of the Baku oil fields being bombed. Within the past ten days there are strong rumours that the Soviet have been pressing the Imperial Government (1) to reduce the Iranian army to a strength sufficient to maintain internal security only; ( 2 ) to stop the further purchase of armaments abroad; (3) to provide in writing for the use of aerodromes; (4) to give up their friendship with the Turks. It is said that the Shah left suddenly for Mazanderan to avoid having to reply to these demands. 11 . Safjbdabad Pact. On the occasion of the birthday of the young King of Iraq, the Tehran press published very friendly articles, with references to the Saadabad Pact. This was something new, as for a long while the Iranian Government had been afraid to mention it, and when M. Sarajoglou went to Moscow they even wired to theirrepresentative to urge him to say as little about it as possible. The press has also had articles about union between eastern peoples, with special references to Turkey. 12. Norwegian and Danish Interests. A number of Norwegian and Danish engineers and architects, who ar€^ h employed by Messrs. Kampsax and the Danish sardine factory at Bandar Shahpur, have volunteered for service with the British or Norwegian armies. They are prepared to give up everything in order to do so. The recent Allied withdrawal from Norway has caused them considerable dismay and doubt. 13. Iraqi Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 5 (current), paragraph 18. The Imperial Government have agreed in principle to the formation of a joint Iraqi- Irano Air Service Company to fly passengers and air mail between Tehran and Bagdad. 14. Communications. Additional notes on Routes No. VII Kazvin-Resht, Astara-Ardebil (route 42), and Pahlavi-Astara are given as Appendix A(') to this summary. 15. Commercial Traffic. Strict orders have now been issued that motor lorries arriving with goods from the Fars and Isfahan provinces must not proceed any further than Qum, from whence their loads must be .sent by goods train to Tehran. Goods from Khorasan and East Persia have similarly to be railed to the capital from Semnan. Eventually also all goods arriving by sea will be imported into Iran via Bandar Shahpur. H. J.

ON the afternoon of the 14th May, His Imperial Majesty the Shah, attended by their Imperial Highnesses the Princes Shahpur Pahlavi, returned to the capital from a prolonged tour in Mazanderan and Gilan. The Imperial tour followed much the same itinerary as on previous occasions. The first place visited was Gurgan, where the new hotel and boys’ school (Lycee “ Iranshahr ”) were inspected. On the orders of their father the three princes visited each class in turn, and later reported to the Shah what they had observed. From Gurgan the Imperial party proceeded to Behshahr where the local hospital and cotton-printing factory were inspected. The towns of Sari and Shahi were next. At the latter place His Imperial Majesty and the princes saw the sack making factory and spinning and weaving factory, where the Shah made special enquiries as to the factory workers’ welfare organisations. At Babul the Imperial party were joined by their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Prince and Princess, who remained there for two days before returning to Tehran by rail. A day’s excursion was made to Amul. where the Shah inspected work on the new route Amul-Lar-Tehran. En route to the palace at No Shahr the Shah inspected the Grand Hotel at Babulsar from top to bottom. At No Shahr the newly completed harbour was carefully inspected as was also the silk factory. Shahsavar, Ramsar (Gilan Province), Rudsar, Lahijan (tea-growing centre), Resht, and Bandar Pahlavi were the next towns to be visited. The return journey from Bandar Pahlavi was made via Resht and the Chalus road. This is the first occasion on which the Shah has taken three of his younger sons with him on an official tour. They were Shahpur Ali Reza Pahlavi (aged fs), Shahpur Ghulam Reza Pahlavi (aged 17) and Shahpur Abdul Reza Pahlavi (aged 16). 2. Iranian Officials. M. Ghulam Reza Nurzad (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 204; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 148) has been appointed director of the Third Political Section at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

(i) One thousand Brno heavy machine-guns have been delivered in They are said to have been part of the cargo of the Italian ship Caiso, w ic arrived from Trieste at Bandar Shahpur on the 26th April. j t&gt; v,* (ii) On a recent tour no troops were observed between San and Kesnt on the Caspian Littoral. One battalion is in camp on the Tehran-Kerej-Chains road in the Muzzanabad-Baude area (degree sheet 8 P B3). (iii) Sarhang (Colonel) Irawani is acting General Officer Commanding, loth (Khurramabad) Division. (iv) A new section of the General Staff, which deals with military publications, has been formed. (v) The location of the (Amnieh) gendarmerie eight regiments and sixteen independent battalions is given in Appendix A to this summary.^) (vi) Enquiries have been made recently through the Ministry of Finance for the purchase of 30,000 gas masks complete. (vii) The General Staff have issued orders to all commands that troops must be alert and ready. Arrangements must be practised at once for the quick issue of arms, ammunition and bombs. (viii) An Iranian Order of Battle, given to the French Military Attache by the Minister of War, is given as Appendix B to this summary.O 5. Italian Interests. Thirty-nine Italians of military age have been concentrated in Tehran ready to leave for Italy via U.S.S.R. should Italy enter the war. 6 . German Interests. (i) The Deutsche Arbeitsfront Ortsgruppe of Tehran have rented a large garden at Gulhek adjacent to the property of his Excellency the Kavam-ul-Mulk. Physical training, &amp;c., is regularly carried out there, as well as week-end walking- tours in the mountains. (ii) Since the outbreak of war the staff of the German Legation has increased from about eight to thirty-four. A number of them are ex-officers or reserve officers. German business houses in Tehran have also increased abnormally : A.E.G., which usually has a staff of about thirty, is now seventy-three, and Messrs. Schluter’s staff has grown from six to eighteen. Many of these men have very little or nothing to do, so it is to be assumed that they form part of the German Fifth Column in Iran. (iii) It has been noticed recently that the Germans are cultivating the friend ship of Iranians with whom they have contacts or business relations. Attempts have also been made to get into touch with Iranians known to be against the present regime. The German Military Attache unsuccessfully tried to get into touch with one of the leading Bakhtiari Khans who compulsorily lives in Tehran. (iv) On the 15th May forty-seven students of the school of art and handi crafts left for Germany via U.S.S.R. These students will on return be employed at the Kerej blast furnaces. In spite of protestations on the part of their parents, these youths were compelled to go. (v) Urgent despatches for the German Foreign Office are conveyed in a special bag or bags within the diplomatic bags of the Italian Legation in Tehran. The Italian courier car normally leaves Tehran fortnightly for Bagdad, where the bags are handed over to the Ala Littoria Airways for conveyance to Rome. One of the Italian courier car drivers is Italian, the other Syrian; they have orders not to stop anywhere en route. (vi) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 9 (current), paragraph 9 (i). Major von Geldern-Crespendorff paid brief visits to Senneh (Kurdistan) before visiting Kermanshah, and after leaving the latter place he proceeded on reconnaissance to Sultanabad (Arak). (*) Not printed.3 (vii) The Germans in Bandar Pahlavi now number about fifty, they are well-organised and have as their leader one De Haas, an S.S. officer, this individual has otherwise no legitimate business in this port. (viii) The German Legation has five wireless experts at its disposal, including the two ordinary operators. One of these experts is reported as building small ^®^portable transmitting sets from surplus materials which were imported by Messrs. Telefunken for their wireless constructional work in Iran. 7. U.S.S.R. Interests. From a reliable police source it is stated that there are 5,000 Persians who returned nominally as refugees from Russia last year, and who are now located in the neighbourhood of Tehran. The majority of 60,000 Russian refugees who entered Iran last year via Bajgiran (Khorasan Province), Julfa and Bandar Pahlavi live in Tehran. Con trary to reports, they are nearly all people of the petty-trader or shopkeeper class. A number of them have been transferred to the provincial towns, as they were alleged to have been spreading Communist propaganda. 8 . United States Interests. (i) Acting on instructions from his Government, the American Charge d’Affaires informed the Prime Minister that import and export credits scheme could not be used for the purchase of military aircraft in the United States. If the Iranian Government wished to buy American military aircraft on credit, they must make their own arrangements with the banks. Dr. Matin Daftary seemed disappointed at this statement, and it is now possible that the Iranian authorities will purchase aircraft from elsewhere. (ii) The Iranian Government have been making enquiries in the United States about the purchase of contact mines. The quantity is not known, nor whether actually any have so far been bought. It is considered that these mines might be laid in the Caspian Sea, but it is doubtful whether the Iranians would have the courage to do so. Had mine-laying been intended in the Persian Gulf, it is presumed that the Soviet and the Germans would have provided the mines either gratis or very cheaply. 9. Communications. According to the press the new route between Isfahan and Azna railway station will shortly be opened to traffic. This route is 225 kilom. long and passes through the following villages: — Najafabad, million sheet 9 , D 4. Dunbeni (Denbaneh), million sheet 9, C 3. Chaman-i-Sultan, million sheet 9, B 3. Ali Gudar, million sheet 9, B 3. Azna, million sheet 9, B 3. At Azna there are oil storage tanks, and it will be from this place that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company will distribute their oil supplies to the provinces of Isfahan, Yezd, Kerman and Pars. 10. Iranian Landing Grounds. The Minister for Foreign Affairs strongly denied to His Majesty’s Minister that there was any truth in the reports that Iranian landing grounds were to be placed at the disposal of the Soviet in certain circumstances. ^ 1 The Foreign Minister also stated that, while article 6 of the treaty ot IJgl was still in force, the Imperial Government considered it entirely unsuitable to present conditions and not in conformity with the Iranian policy of neutrality. He further stated that during the negotiations for the trade agreement no mention was ever made of the 1921 treaty. tt- at • ’ tv/t- • f After takin 0, orders from the Shah, M. Alaam gave His Majesty s Minister a flat denial of the report that the British aircraft personnel m Tehran were to be replaced by other persons.4 11 . Internal Situation. Dissatisfaction with the present regime is becoming more and more marked. This is important for the following reasons : As stated in previous reports, the Shah is generally regarded as having won his position by means of British support. It is inevitable, therefore, that dissatisfaction with the regime is accom-,-^, panied by strong anti-British feeling. Further, nearly all sections of the com- * munity are imbued with pro-German sentiment. It is probable that as much as 70 per cent, of the middle and upper classes in Northern Iran are pro-German. They have been subject to intense propaganda on the part of the large number of Germans now in the country, who are estimated at between 1,700 and 2 , 000 . Many of these have entered Iran since the outbreak of war, and of these latter few are bona-fide merchants. In the event of the stability of the regime being endangered, it is not impossible that some of them would be used to instigate a couf d’Etat, should the German Government decide that the interests of the Reich required the removal from power of the present Shah. Allied military successes more than anything else are needed if the increase of German influence is to be checked. But, in view of the fact that the present regime is associated in the public mind with the Union Jack, Great Britain could hardly recover the position which she formerly held in Iran unless such successes are accompanied by an improvement in the general condition, both economic and political, of the masses.

Tehran, June 5, 1940. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 11 for the Period ending June 1 , 1940. 1 . The Shah and the Imperial Family. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Imperial family remain in residence at the Imperial Palace in Tehran. On Friday, the 24th May, their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Prince and Princess, accompanied by Prince Abdur Reza Pahlavi, attended the final day of the Spring Races at Jalalieh Race Course. 2 . Iranian Officials. His Excellency M. Nadir Arasteh. Iranian Minister in Berlin, who had been recently recalled, has now arrived in Tehran. It is said that the reason for M. Arasteh's recall was that he had gone too far in the participation of the exaggerated German junketings for the Shah’s birthday. The Shah did not like fulsome compliments to himself being sandwiched with ravings about the “ Yids,” and talks about the demoralisation of countries by England by means of opium, bribery and V.D. Another reason for his recall may have been the discovery of the selling of passports by certain members of the legation staff. 3. Iranian A rmy. (i) 15-cm. field-guns recently delivered from Skodas via Trieste are reported to have many parts missing, and, in consequence, are unserviceable. (ii) Equipment and small arms continue to be forwarded by small motor-lorry convoys under a guard to the provincial divisions. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 9, paragraph 3 (i). Reserve Class 1292 (1914), having completed its one month’s refresher training, has been discharged. Reserve Class 1290 (1912) is now under training. (iv) It is stated that the decision to abandon the formation of the cavalry divisions at Khoi and Kuchan and the infantry division at Bujnurd was due to Soviet pressure. (v) Two different but reliable officer sources consider it unlikely that the Iranian army will oppose any invasion by Soviet troops. Army circles are being profoundly stirred by the German successes in the Low Countries and Northern France.2 4. Iranian Air Force. A consular report from Meshed states that on the 1 st May two military aircraft collided in mid-air and crashed. All four occupants were killed and the machines completely wrecked. This is said to be the first fatal flying accident to have occurred in Meshed. No mention of this accident has been made in the press. The type of aircraft involved is as yet unknown. 5. Iranian Navy. The port authorities at Bandar Shahpur are enforcing a regulation which prohibits vessels carrying explosives for ports other than Bandar Shahpur from berthing alongside the jetty with explosives on board. The Iranian naval authorities insist on ships carrying explosives discharging the same into barges before proceeding alongside and reloading after completing discharge. Ihis regulation is causing extreme inconvenience to shipowners, and. moreover, the discharge of explosives into barges with unskilled labour is a most dangerous proceeding at any time. Negotiations are now proceeding for the reversal of this order. 6 . Norwegian Interests. Several Norwegian volunteers are shortly leaving Iran for Norway and Sweden via U.S.S.R. Lieutenant Forde Halle, of the 11 th Norwegian Infantry (Andalsnes), who applied to return to duty via England in April last, has not yet left this country, as, it is stated, he is dissatisfied with the Allies for with drawing from Norway. The Norwegian Consul-General hopes to persuade him to return via U.S.S.R. 7. Polish Interests. His Excellency Jan Karszo-Siedlewski, the Polish Minister, proceeded on duty to Angers, France, via Beirut on the 20 th May. 8 . Danish Interests. The Danish fishing vessel Grette Knoy'per, on a voyage to Bandar Abbas to join the ships of the recently opened Iranian sardine factory, has been declared a prize and detained in Port Said. The vessel may later on be sold to the Iranian Government. The ship’s papers did not show whether the purchase money had been paid by the Imperial Government or not. 9. Japanese Interests. Mr. Kichi Koasaki. an attache of the Japanese Legation, has formally announced in the local press his conversion to Islam. He now bears the name Abdullah. Mr. Koasaki speaks fluent Persian and Hindustani. 10. Soviet Interests. (i) Several secret meetings have recently been held between the Shah, his Ministers and the Soviet Ambassador. It is impossible to ascertain for certain what is going on, but the subjects under discussion seem to be still connected with ( 1 ) the use of landing-grounds in Iran; (2) Iranian oil and possible expropriation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company properties in South Iran by the Imperial Government with a view to their being handed over for exploitation later on to the Soviets; (3) regulation of the right of entry into Iran of Soviet troops. There are other demands, but these cannot be discovered for certain. Lately it has been reported that the Soviet Ambassador has adopted an insistent, if not threatening, attitude. If this is so, then it is considered most probable that the Shah will in the end be forced to capitulate to all the Russian demands. (ii) The first consignment of goods from Soviet Russia since the conclusion of the commercial agreement has now reached Bandar Pahlavi. The consignment includes iron sheets and girders. (iii) According to a consular report from Tabriz, numerous troop trains have been observed recently passing through Tiflis in the direction of Baku and the south. Another report states that the Russian troops on the Caucasian frontier have increased.11. German Interests. (i) Two of the local cinemas now regularly exhibit U.F.A. newsreel films with running commentary in Persian. (ii) Recently in the Maidan-i-Sepah, in the centre of Tehran, the crowd listening to the loud-speaker affixed to the Iranian telegraphs building clapped and cheered on hearing news of the continued German successes in the Low Countries. The police intervened and over forty persons were arrested. They were released after a few hours' detention. It is stated on good authority that German agents paid 5 rials each to many of those listening to take part in this demonstration. The loud-speakers are now only switched on for music and local i news in Persian. (iii) Certain German agents are endeavouring to spread propaganda amongst the British Indian community in Tehran. The majority of British Indians in fhe capital are engaged in the selling of motor-car spare parts, tyres, tea, &amp;c. They are for the most part Khatri Sikhs from the Chakwal Tehsil of Jhelum District and are strong sympathisers with the Indian National Congress. (iv) Consular reports from South Iran indicate unusual and suspicious activities on board the five German Hansa Line steamers now lying at Bandar Shahpur, especially on board the steamships Hohenfels and Weissenfels. The wireless sets of these two ships, which had been sealed up by the Iranian naval authorities, have been recently used. The Iranian naval authorities have now resealed the transmitters, but took no other action, not even reporting this gross breach of neutrality to Tehran. Thirty to forty heavy cases were recently transferred from an Italian steamer unloading at Bandar Shahpur to the steamship Weissenfels. The contents are unknown, but may have been stores for the crews. It is considered quite possible that one or two of these ships may slip out to sea and attempt to scuttle themselves in the “ Rooka ” channel of the Shatt- el-Arab, which is only a short distance away, or may land armed parties in the oil area. Strong representations have been made by His Majesty’s Minister to the Imperial Government about the possible danger to the oil-fields, and regarding the risk if a sudden attempt to upset the Government by concerted efforts of Germans on lines similar to those adopted in other countries. This warning has reached the Shah, but so far he seems to be unwilling to take any effective counter-measures. The situation is complicated by reliable reports that the police, as a result of bribery, are favourable to German interests. (v) The number of German seamen now on board the five Hansa Line steamers is estimated at between forty-five and fifty. A rest-house has been rented for them for the summer in Tehran, and the first leave party is expected shortly. 12 . Communications. Route V, section (B). Shiraz to Isfahan via Abadeh, mile 213. Pul-i-Khan. A new stone bridge is being constructed on the River Kur (Bande Amir) further downstream. This bridge will be 60 metres long, with one arch of 35 metres. The old Pul-i-Khan Bridge is now incapable of carrying the heavy motor traffic between Shiraz and the sugar factory at Marv Dasht (mile 214). H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel. Military Attache.

HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Imperial Family are now in residence at the summer palaces at Saadabad. The Shah has recently purchased large tracts of very fertile land in the Langarud area (Gilan Province), degree sheet 8 , K.A. 4. B His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince has been spending much of his time with different units of the Tehran Garrison, and taking part in tactical exercises without troops. 2. Iranian Officials. The death of Abbas Quli Gharib (Mutajim-ul-Mamaluk) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 100 , and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 92) took place on the 2nd June. 3. Iranian Air Force. (i) Several of the British personnel (thirteen), employed under contract at the Doshantappeh Aircraft Factory, are becoming restless, feeling that they ought to be working on aircraft production in the Tnited Kingdom, where their specialised skill would be invaluable at this time. (ii) An attempt is being made by a German expert, recently introduced into the Doshantappeh Aircraft Factory, to put in order two discarded and obsolete Junker machines. (iii) Three Aii speed Oxford machines, twin-engine advanced training monoplanes, have arrived from the United Kingdom and are rapidly being assembled at Ahwaz. One has already been flown to Tehran. (iv) The Iranian staff at the Doshantappeh Aircraft Factory are over 200 workers short. Many of the men absent themselves from work, the reason being that to supplement their miserable pay the workers club together to keep shops or run small businesses. They then stay away in turn to look after them. 4. Turkish Interests. i ^ S 1 ! the Staff Captain Kemal Sanjak, Turkish Military Attache left Tehran for Turkey on relief by Staff Captain Osman Nuri Canberk. 5. Egyptian Interests. His Excellency Yussef Zulfikar Pasha, the Egyptian Ambassador, has returned to Tehran. [7-53] B2 6 . United States Interests. Dr. S. M. Jordan, headmaster of the Alborz College of Tehran, was awarded a gold medal by the Ministry of Education for his outstanding services to Iranian education. Dr. Jordan has been in Iran forty-two years and is shortly retiring.^ 7. German Interests. (i) Certain details of the Nazi organisation in Tehran are given as an appendix to this summary. (ii) Fifteen German experts under a Herr Saif are employed at the arsenal near the Maidan-i-Sepah. Sixteen others are employed at the arsenal and powder factory at Saltanatabad, near Tehran. (iii) There is some evidence that the strong representations by the British and Allied representatives concerning the German menace have not been without their effect on the Iranian authorities, but, although certain measures to counteract the danger have been taken, fear of Germany causes the measures taken to be circuitous and feeble. 8 . Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Depots. A complete list of benzine storage depots with tank capacity is given as an appendix to this summary. 9. Landing Grounds. (i) According to the Iranian press, the Bandar Pahlavi (Kazian) aerodrome is being considerably enlarged. The name tc Ghazian ” has been marked out in concrete letters in the middle (40 metres square) of the aerodrome. A trellis-work fence surrounds the aerodrome, marked by pillars at 50-metre intervals. No information as to who will eventually use this aerodrome can be obtained either from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of War. (ii) Work on the Gurgan landing ground near Gumbad-i-Kabus, and on another at Gumish Tappeh, is stated to be progressing. 10 . Communications. M.T. Route No. 41, Tabriz to Ardebil via Ah&amp;r and Mishin Shahr.—This road has been reconnoitred recently and found to be practically impassable except for animal transport. Very little work is being done to improve the route. Bandar Pahlavi-A star a. —At present only passable by light motor vehicles. Many bridges are still under construction. After Karganrud the road is a mere track. At mile 51 from Bandar Pahlavi there are marshy and muddy flats which are difficult to cross. 11 . Internal Situation. There have been some signs of a shortage of bread at certain bakeries in Tehran. It is alleged that plenty of flour is distributed, and that these shortages may be due to sabotage, but a high Government official admits that wheat is being brought in rapidly from the south to meet any shortage. Crop reports, particularly from Veramin, are not good. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache. Tehran, June 15, 1940.3 Appendix A to Enclosure. The Nazi Organisation in Iran. THE aims of the Nazi organisation in Iran are (1) the unification of the Germans; (2) their organisation into groups called “ Blocks ; ( 3 ) their military training camouflaged as sports of various kinds; (4) their supervision to see that all remain good members of the party.

Notes. 1 . Blockwarts supervise all party members in their blocks. They must know their contacts, their resources, &amp;c. 2. On the 16th May a practice assembly took place m Tehran. No previous warning had been given. 600 Germans assembled at various points within three hours. This apparently was considered inefficient, and further practices are to take place. [7—53] B 2II .—Organisation of Nazi Leaders and “ Politische Loiter.’ On the birthday of the Fiihrer twenty-five Politische Lei ter took oath. I hey are as follows :— 1.

The Von Cammen Stables (ex Lessmann). Courses in equitation under the direction of Wurthmann, an employee of the German Legation (since the 1 st May, 1940). Germans are being encouraged to buy horses for personal use. 3. K.D.F. (“ Strength through Joy ”). Every Thursday and Friday this section carries out strenuous excursions into the countryside and Elburz mountains. All members are dressed alike in shorts and shirts, and carry “ rucksacks.” Map-reading is also taught on the 1/25,000 sheet. On a recent excursion instruction took place in map enlarging in the Lashkarak area north of Tehran. 4. Brown House. Meetings are held almost daily. All Germans have to attend at least two meetings per week to listen to the “ good news,” receive instructions, and make contact with the various group leaders. 5. German Official News.

Tehran, July 2, 1940. (Secret.) Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 13 for the Period ending June 29, 1940. 1. The Shah and the Imperial Family. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Imperial family continue in residence at the summer palaces of Saadabad. On the morning of the 28th June His Imperial Majesty the Shah addressed members of the Government, Deputies of the Majlis and press directors at the Saadabad Palace. The Shah’s decision to address the Majlis direct is considered to be of unusual importance. His Imperial Majesty has made no such recorded statement of policy direct to the Deputies for at least six years past, apart from his more or less formal speeches at the opening of each session. It is reliably reported that the Shah also informed the Deputies that the country was in danger and that it was their duty to form a new policy without delay. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) An imperial decree was issued on the 26th June appointing his Excellency Ali Mansur, C.B.E., Minister of Industry and Mines (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 164, and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 122), Prime Minister, in addition to his present portfolio. (ii) By order of His Imperial Majesty the Shah, Dr. Matin Daftary, the Prime Minister, and M. Ali Asghar Hikmat, the Minister of the Interior, have been relieved of their duties. The official reason published was “ for rest ” and ‘ ‘ health ’ ’ reasons respectively. (iii) From reliable sources, not yet confirmed, it is stated that Musa Noury Isfandiary (Movaffaq-us-Sultaneh), Iranian Minister at Bagdad (Foreign Office Personalities, No. 75), is to be transferred to Berlin in the same capacity. (iv) His Excellency Ali Soheili (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 283, and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 200), Ambassador at Kabul, has been appointed Minister of the Interior. (v) The full list of the new Cabinet is given as an appendix to this summary. 3. Iranian Army. (i) Reports are current that certain units of the Tehran garrison have been sent to Khuzistan. This is not confirmed. (ii) Eighty Telefunken portable wireless sets have been delivered. [ 8 —34]2 (iii) A report states that four classes of reservists are to be called up immediately. (iv) The Tehran garrison are now in summer training camps in the Elburz foothills north of Tehran. 4. Iranian Air Force. (i) The three Airspeed Oxford machines have been flown to Doshanteppeh Aerodrome, Tehran. Mr. B. C. Field, the Airspeed test pilot mechanic, is now engaged in instructing Iranian air force pilots in their use and maintenance. (ii) British air mechanics at Doshanteppeh are now subjected to an arms search before enterng the factory. This is because two weeks ago one of their number jokingly pointed a small unloaded automatic at the assistant stores officer. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 8 , current. Hamadan landing- ground. Remarks add : The hut is connected by telephone to Hamadan. 5. British Interests. The following communique was issued to the press by the Ministry of Finance on the 18th June (translation from the Persian text) :— “ As some time ago it was reported in certain foreign newspapers that a loan agreement had been concluded between the Imperial Government and the British Government, the Ministry of Finance thinks it necessary to give the following explanation :— “ On the 17th Khurdad, 1319 (the 8 th June, 1939), namely, before the outbreak of the European war, at the time when the general manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company came to Tehran to inspect the work of the company, in the course of conversations which he had with the appropriate authorities, in order to express his good intention, he proposed that, if the Imperial Government wished to make purchases for their requirements, the company would be able to place some credits at the Imperial Government’s disposal, which could be refunded later by degrees out of the Government’s royalty relating to the oil company. The proposal in question was considered by the Imperial Government’s officials, and an agreement of views was reached whereby the purchases and transactions which the Imperial Govern ment proposed to make in England, to meet a portion of their requirements (up to a limit of £5 million), should be met from the above-mentioned credits, and that the amount thereof should be repaid gradually out of the Govern ment’s royalty from the oil company. Written agreements were then exchanged in the above sense. As the transactions in question were not carried out by the other party, and the orders were not fulfilled, but set aside and held in abeyance for some time, the agreement in question was abolished and annulled yesterday, Mondav, the 27th Khurdad. 1319 (the 17th June, 1940).” The above communique refers to a credits agreement which was made earlier in the year not with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but with His Majesty’s Government. Its existence had been kept secret mainly at the instance of the Iranian Government, and the method of denunciation is a gross breach of good manners, against which His Majesty’s Government are protesting. While, from the point of view of the need for conserving our financial resources, His Majesty’s Government gain by release from the liabilities assumed under the agreement, its cancellation, coupled with the publication of the fact in the Iranian press, is a dangerous symptom. Among the considerations which have prompted cancellation the following are probably the most important: (a) the Shah’s anger at finding that scarcely anything he wanted could be purchased under the agreement; (b) annoyance at the reduction in exports of Iranian oil and a desire to be able to deal with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company untrammelled by the agreement; (c) resentment at the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to grant a privileged rate for the transfer of sterling to the Jlnited States; (d) his belief that the German successes mean that Great Britain will be useless as a source of supply; and (e) the growth of pro-German feeling in the Iranian Government as a result of those successes and of the signs that Russia is becoming nervous about Germany.3 6 . German Interests. (i) German activities in Iran have been much quieter recently. This may be due to police activities or the expectation of a quick victory over Great Britain. The Soviet, too, are believed to be watching German activities with unfriendly gyes. Germans, too, may very well believe that, as a result of the collapse of France, the Imperial Government will adopt a policy friendlier to Germany. The recent changes in the Cabinet, however, have not borne this out. The new Prime Minister, although a man of no character and unlikely to influence the course of events, is reputed to be friendly to the Allies. The new Minister of the Interior, M. Soheili, was a former Minister in London. Reports from Kabul, however, state he was on very friendly terms with the German Legation there. The Persian broadcasts from Berlin become increasingly critical and are causing the Shah irritation. In reply, Radio Tehran on the 26th June made a short announcement to the effect that the Imperial Government did not know whether the statements of the Berlin radio in its Persian transmission represented the Reich Government’s views or only those of the announcer. In any case, they were inacceptable, and the Iranian Government had an answer and would reply in its own good time.” (ii) For some time lately the German Legation has been drawing up lists of prominent and wealthy Jews in Iran as well as the more wealthy Armenians. The exact reason for this is not known, but it is suspected that these individuals would be offered to the mob as bait should trouble break out in Iran. The Berlin Persian broadcast always makes bitter comment on the Jews. (iii) A German petroleum expert has recently arrived in Tehran. The German Legation is reported to have offered the services of a large number of other oil experts. 7. Czech Interests. As a result of the French collapse, the Czechs in Iran, who number about 200—250, are now very anxious as to their position. In view of General Mittelhauser’s statement that he will no longer take part in the war, many of them wish to come under British protection. Several are desirous of joining the British army, but the majority wish to know if any arrangements can be made for their safety, departure, ultimate residence, &amp;c., in case of trouble. 8 . French Interests. At the news of the Marshal Petain Government s desire for an armistice, the French Legation and colony were incredulous and stunned. On hearing of the acceptance of the armistice terms, this turned to indignation and a firm determination to carry on with the war. The French Military Attache, Commandant Alessandri, telegraphed to General Mittelhauser offering his personal services and those of his staff. In reply he has received orders from Beirut to remain at his post. The two assistant French Military Attaches, who are reserve officers, fear that they may be demobilised by the military authorities in France. Both wish to offer their services to the British. 9 . United States Interests. Eight American citizens and one British subject (Canadian) travelling m L.M. aeroplane chartered for the journey from Bombay to Bahrein via Jask a K L.M. aeroplane cnarterea ior uie juumcy num ^ ’A were detained at Jask, as their passports bore visas for Bahrein issued by the British authorities in India. On urgent representations by the United states Charge d’Affaires in Tehran, the Imperial Government have promised to permit these^passengers to leave Jask by the next aeroplane on the 29th June The Ministry for Foreign Affairs denied with embarrassment that there had been difficulty with visas, and stated (untruthfully) ^that the cause^ of delay was a change in the marking of the K.L.M. aircraft. The aircraft concerned had been allowed to leave. 10. The National Iranian Aero Club. /;\ mpp Aero Club have concluded a contract with an Armenian, M Tufenkdiian agent for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation of the United States ol’America for’thf purchase of twenty-five Rearwin training aircraft, delivery to be within a period of four months.4 r\ (ii) An extraordinary general meeting of the Aero Club was held on the 22nd June with his Excellency Ibrahim Qawam (Qawam-ul-Mulk) in the chair. The secretary-treasurer in his report stated that (a) the sum collected for the Aero Club amounted to 2,436,984 • 20 rials (£40,616); (b) there are 248,000 club members and 3.308 volunteers for instruction in flying; (c) an aerodrome being constructed about 12 to 13 kilom. west of Tehran along the Tehran—Tabrir^y railway line (vide Intelligence Summary No. 3, current). This aerodrome will x be 1 million square metres in extent. Branch flying schools have already been established at Meshed, Ahwaz and Tabriz. 11. Iranian State Railways. (i) Tabriz Branch. —This line has been completed as far as Khurram Darreh (map 8 H.A. 4), 87 kilom. from Zinjan, and 227 kilom. 270 m. from Tehran. Work is in active progress as far as Mianeh and beyond. (ii) Qum-Yezd Branch. —No rails have yet been laid, but the earthworks have been completed as far as Ardakan (million sheet 16 B 4). 12. Civil Hospitals. (i) A civil hospital of 100 beds is being constructed in the Avenue Shahpur, Isfahan. , • i p i j (ii) The Hamadan Municipality are building a hospital of fifty beds. (iii) It is claimed that sixty-foiir hospitals were constructed during 1939-40 in different parts of the country. 13. Press. On the 23rd June the local press published a Deutsches Nachrichten-Biiro telegram from Angora stating that His Imperial Majesty the Shah had congratulated the Turkish Government on its intention to remain outside the European conflict. It can be assumed that, as this passed the Iranian censor, it is correct. It is reported that one of the main reasons for Dr. Matin Daftary s dismissal in disgrace is that he communicated to the German Legation the contents of this secret telegram. 14.

Tehran, July 17, 1940. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 14 for the Period ending Jidy 13, 1940. 1 . The Shah and the Imperial Family. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Imperial family are in residence at Saadabad. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) On the 3 rd- 4 th July M. Kai Khosrow Shahrokh, the Deputy for the Zoroastrians of Iran, was found lying dead in a Tehran street. M. Shahrokh was an ardent patriot, and had been president of the Zoroastrian Society for over thirty years. Amongst other things, he was chief director of the telephone company and was instrumental in starting the Majlis press. One of his sons, Shahbahram Shahrokh, is the infamous Persian announcer of the Berlin radio. Many attribute the death of Kai Khosrow Shahrokh to foul play, and connect it with the personal attacks on the Shah which Radio Berlin had made in Persian on the two preceding nights. German propagandists immediately stated that it was an act of revenge by the English. (ii) His Imperial Majesty the Shah has appointed M. Majid Ahi (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 6 ; Foreign Office Personalities, No. 9), a former Minister of Communications, to be Minister of Justice. (iii) The appointment of Musa Noury Isfandiary, mentioned in Intelligence Summary No. 13 (current), paragraph 2 (iii), is confirmed. 3. Iranian Army. (i) Intelligence Summary No. 10 (current), paragraph 4 (v), and Appendix A to that summary, and all references to gendarmerie in the Order of Battle, 1940, are cancelled and the following substituted :— Gendarmerie .—The Iranian gendarmerie is organised (1) into regiments whose duties are the policing of the roads and country districts; ( 2 ) independent battalions whose duty is the guarding of the frontiers. Each regiment or independent battalion has a special “ bureau ” for police work, such as courts of investigation, &amp;c. A regiment of gendarmerie is not divided into battalions, but is composed of 6 to 9 companies, each of which has nominally 1 company officer, 3 platoon commanders, and 150 n.c.o.s and armed policemen, consisting of 1 platoon of infantry and 2 platoons of cavalry. An independent battalion is composed of 4 to 6 companies. The gendarmerie is armed solely with old pattern rifles of various makes: Russian, French and even some English carbines, &amp;c. They have not so far been issued with automatic weapons of any sort. For discipline and administration the force is under the supervision of the G.O.C. of the division in whose area [8-75] Bthey are stationed. For police administration work, they come under the local civil authorities. &lt; , The gendarmerie force consists of ten regiments and fifteen independent battalions. A location statement of these units is given as Appendix C ( ) to this summary. (ii) According to a consular report from Khorramshahr, a detachment of 50 men with 2 tanks, 4 anti-aircraft guns, 2 field guns and 6 machine guns arrived at Abadan for the protection of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. It may be presumed that these reinforcements were supplied by the 6 th (Khuzistan) Division. (iii) All units of the 1st and 2nd Divisions are now in summer training camps to the north of Tehran. Two infantry regiments have been warned to stand by for entrainment to Gurgan at twenty-four hours notice. (iv) Tanks are being overhauled and put into condition for active service. Stocks of p.o.l. and ammunition have been replenished and checked. 4. British Interests. On the 7th July in the Majlis, the Minister for Finance (General Amir Khosrovi) repeated once again to a crowded house the Iranian Government’s well- known grievances against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and accused the company of failure to fulfil certain articles of the concession. He said that, according to the promises of the company, production ought to have risen to 14 million tons per annum instead of diminishing. The Imperial Government would do all they could to rectify this state of affairs. Three Deputies, MM. Sadr, Tabatai and Lighvani, followed and spoke more violently. M. Tabatai, editor of the Itila'at, quoted Bahrein (which he described as Iranian property) as totally disproving the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s argument that production is limited by markets. The only concrete proposal was that the Government should demand either increased royalties at a fixed rate regardless of output, or else the abandonment by the company of those fields, especially Gach Saran and Pazanan, which they cannot exploit to the full. The Prime Minister (his Excellency M. Ali Mansur) wound up the debate with a further assurance of Government action, and a promise to keep the Majlis fully informed. It is interesting to note that no reference was made throughout the debate to the arbitration clause of the concession. On the other hand, the Prime Minister told His Majesty’s Minister a few days before the debate that the Iranian Government did not intend to cancel the concession and wished to work with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. It is, in fact, a question of blackmail. If the threat to cancel the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company concession faded away, it was probably thanks to the Shah’s anger against the Germans for their broadcasts in Persian. Almost at once, however, Great Britain again became unpopular owing to the references in the latest German white book to the possible bombing of Baku by the Allies and to the participation of Iran, at British instigation, in land operations against Russia. The Russian wireless and press began to threaten Iran for complicity in the Allied scheme against Russia, and in order to conciliate her powerful neighbour Iran made attacks on Great Britain in the controlled press, referring to deprivation of rights (i.e., in regard to oil), to Great Britain’s alleged lack of sympathy for Iran, and to the impropriety of engaging in diplomatic talks involving Iran without Iran’s knowledge. His Majesty’s Government have sent a final reply to a request from the Iranian Government for permission to transfer sterling to the United States, up to £3 million sterling a year, at the Government rate, to cover purchases in America. The reply concedes all the essential part of the request, but points out that this is exceptional treatment. 5. French Interests. The French Military Attache, Commandant Alessandri, deplores the Oran and Richelieu incidents, and states that this will undoubtedly affect Anglo-French relations and recruiting for General de Gaulle’s Legion. He and his colleagues, however, remain the same friendly collaborators as before. Commandant Alessandri intends to visit Beirut in the near future for'instructions as to whether his post is to be retained or not. P) Not printed.3 &lt; 7M) 6 . German Interests. (i) The Germans made the great mistake of allowing violent attacks on the Shah in person to be made in their Persian broadcasts. The one thing the Shah cannot bear is any attack on his person or his dynasty. The Tehran press published complaints against these broadcasts, and, although they characteristically refrained from mentioning the main ground of objection, tmry seem to have been effective. Germany alleged that the announcer was personally responsible, and his voice has not been heard since. This explanation, however, has not prevented the authorities from contemplating action against the Gei mans. A number are under orders to leave Iran, and it is believed that all contracts concluded with German firms are being scrutinised. (ii) Large notices are featured in the press advertising the Leipzig Autumn Fair at the end of August. Sixty per cent, reduction in rail fares and cheap accommodation are offered to intending travellers in the Reich territory. 7. Soviet Interests. On the 10th July his Excellency the Soviet Ambassador invited the whole of the Diplomatic Corps and high Iranian officials to view, at one of the local cinemas, the Russian film “ Peter the Great.' . . Before the main film was shown, a thirty-five-minute reel depicting the 1J30 march-past of the Red army in Moscow on the 1 st May was shown. It is generallv agreed that this was purposely exhibited to impress the Iranian officials with Russia’s might. , , c • i Fears of Russia have been revived by the attacks on Iran by the Soviet wireless and press on account of passages in the new German white book (see paragraph 4). The Iranian Government assert their loyalty to their engagements towards the Soviet Union and their firm intention to maintain their neutrality. 8 . Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. (i) On the 2nd July a serious accident occurred at the valve station at Rahdar, where the pipe-lines from Masjid-i-Suleiman to Abadan converge. Two English engineers, with a party of Iranian fitters, were occupied m drawing the pipes and reversing the valves along the whole line so that surplus oil might be pumped back from Abadan into the wells. The two Englishmen had opened the valves at Rahdar and had just left the valve-house, leaving the Iranian fitters to complete the work, when an explosion occurred. The four Iranians died of burns, while the Englishmen escaped. The fire is still burning. The cause ot the explosion is unknown. No such accident has occurred before. Negligence is unlikelv seeing that the engineer in charge ana head fitters were men of many years’ experience. At the same time there is nothing to indicate that it was due sab ^ n ^ 0 _i ran i an Oil Company are constructing the following benzine filling stations or depots, which will be completed during 1940 (reference, M.

Iranian A ir Force. , (i) It is stated that a new aerodrome with underground hangars is to be constructed near the present Doshanteppeh civil aerodrome, 3 kilom. east of Tehran. (ii) Aerodromes are to be constructed at Sufian, 36 kilom. from Tabriz (million sheet 1 , B 2), and at Rezaieh, 2^ kilom. east of the town. (iii) The construction of an aerodrome at Gumish Tappeh (million sheet 15, C 3), 1 ^ kilom. east of sea-shore, has been completed. 10 . Agriculture. (i) As a result of the recommendation of Mr. F. S. Harris, the Department of Agriculture are holding a special course of instruction for forest officers and another for forest wardens. These courses will last one year. A note on the northern forests of Iran is given as Appendix B(') to this summary. (ii) The cultivation of indigo is to be increased. The main area in which this plant is grown is at Dizful, in Khuzistan. 11 . Iranian State Railway. (i) Tehran-Kazvin. —This line is now open to traffic. Passenger trains leave on Mondays and Thursdays for Kazvin, returning the same day. The duration of the journey is three hours twenty-two minutes. (ii) Tehran-Tabriz .—The alignment of the railway after reaching Mianeh (kilometre 439), degree sheet 10, C 3, will cross and recross the course of the River Karangu Chai, and then turns south-west to Miandoab, whence a branch will be built up to Tabriz. This sector, which comprises “Lots” 10 , 11 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. requires much bridging and tunnelling work, and is not expected to be completed until after January 1943. It is interesting to note that contracts for these new and difficult ‘ 4 Lots ’ ’ have been awarded to German firms, amongst whom Messrs. Hochtief, Mon berg and Thorsen are prominent. Stations between Mianeh and the length of the Karangu Chai River have been fixed at the following points :— Mianeh (kilometre 439), at E of Garmeh, degree sheet 10, C 3 , then crossing the Tava Rud (Aqduchmish on map) to— Yenglabad (kilometre 4431?) Abak (kilometre 455^) ^ Galajak (kilometre 470^) Bizini (kilometre 484^) } not on map. Dommeh (kilometre 495^) Khorassanla (kilometre 506) J Ak Dagh (kilometre 513), degree sheet 10, A 3 . Rail-laying on this branch is in progress as far as Zinjan. (iii) Tehran—Meshed. Rails will be laid as far as Damghan this year Work is in progress as far as kilometre 560 from Tehran, midway between Maimeh and Sabzewar. (iv) Qum-Yezd.—Lme is ready for rail-laying between Qum and Kashan Work is m progress beyond Ardakan, kilometre 410 from Qum. It is expected to complete this branch as far as Yezd by the end of 1942, provided rails are obtainable. 12. Machine-Gun Factory. The machine-gun factory is situated 1 kilometre east of Tehran between the Central Electric Power Station and the aerodrome at Doshanteppeh. The factory is not yet completed. The major part of the machinery has been installed, and further consignments are expected in the course of the next few weeks. Several Czechs occupy key positions in this factory. The annual output aimed at when the factory is working at eiMit hours per diem is expected to be as follows :— 400 heavy machine guns. 1,200 light automatics. (ONot printed.5 The machinery being installed is of the latest and most modern pattern. Raw material, iron bars, &amp;c., has been previously ordered for the next five years from the Poldi Works in Czecho-Slovakia. 13. Education.

Iranian Press. The Shah’s adjuration to the press to write articles to guide the people has been followed by the publication of articles referring to foreign policy in which the Germans and the British and even the Russians nave been scolded or at least reasoned with. It is hardly necessary to say that all these articles will have been concocted under the direction of the highest authority. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache.

Tehran, July 30, 1940. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 15 for the Period ending July '27, 1940. (Secret.) 1 . The Shah and the Imperial Family. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Imperial Family remain in residence in the summer palaces at Saadabad. The Shah and His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince continue to visit army and air force units of the Tehran Garrison. 2. Iranian Officials. M. Mehdi Farrokh (Mutasim-us-Saltaneh) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 85. and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 79) has been appointed Governor- General of the VHth Department (Fars), with headquarters at Shiraz, to fill an existing vacancy. 3. Iranian Army. (i) Consular reports from Meshed state that the garrisons of Kuchan (million sheet 22 , C 3) and Sarrakhs (million sheet 28, B 4) have been reinforced. (ii) The Tehran Garrison continues its routine duties. New conscripts are arriving in batches for their military training, whilst those who have completed their training are being discharged normally. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 9, paragraph 3 (i). Reserve Class 1288 (1910), having completed its one' month’s refresher training, has been discharged. Reserve Class 1285 (1907) is now undergoing training. (iv) In Iranian army circles it is rumoured that the British are supplying rifles and ammunition to the Bakhtiari and Lur tribesmen, as several military patrols have recently been attacked in these tribal areas. (v) Colonel Atapur, O.B.E., has been appointed Chief of Staff to the 12th (Kermanshah) Division. Colonel Atapur is an efficient and capable officer, but extremely pro-German. 4. Iranian Air Force.

The 25 “ Rearwin ” training planes are monoplanes, dual control, two-seaters with Ken-Royce engines (formerly Le Blond) of 140 h.p. each. The price per machine is $5,400. (ii) On the 14th July flying instruction began at the Tabriz aerodrome for members of the local branch of the Aero Club. There are seventeen students, including one girl. Flying is carried out on Mondays and Thursdays. 7. British Interests. The fact that the Imperial Government chose this moment to raise the oil question in the way they did strengthened the common belief that the power of Great Britain is on the wane. Articles in the Government-controlled press exhorting the Imperial Government to take steps in the matter, the absence ot any sign that the British Government (which is scarcely distinguished in local eyes from the company) was prepared to take a strong line, and the German victories in Europe all encouraged the belief, and one might even say the general hope, that Great Britain is virtually a beaten country. The general reaction to the present negotiations between Ihe Imperial Government and the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company is that the Imperial Government is merely blackmailing the company. That ii appears able to do so convinces the Iranians not of British reasonableness, but of British weakness. Some reports still insist that it is Soviet Russia who has instigated the Imperial Government to take this action against the oil company, as the Soviet wish to see British influence entirely removed from Iran or at least considerably lessened. On the 16th July the Ministry of Finance presented the Imperial Govern ment’s demands in writing to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. These are as follows: (1) That the company should pay royalties on maximum possible exploitation and surrender the unexploited areas; ( 2 ) that the company should pay compensation for the loss suffered by the Imperial Government through the method of payment of royalties. At the time of writing, the Imperial Government seem to have become more reasonable. They still demand money, but talk more about c ‘ help ’ ’ and less about failure to fulfil the terms of the concession. The sudden change is probably attributable mainly to the impression created by Great Britain’s firm attitude towards Germany, though the new British exchange control regulations, which have for the moment paralysed the Iranian market, may have had something to do with it. 8 . U.S.S.R. Interests. On the 24th July two official Iranian missions left for Russia. The first of these missions is charged with negotiations in accordance with a letter annexed to the recently signed Irano-Soviet Commercial Treaty, and which for the first time is publicly mentioned, for the improvement and regulation of transport and transit facilities between Iran and Russia, both by sea and rail. The mission is composed of the following officials :— Leader: M. Hamid Sayyah, Director-Geheral of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 258, and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 183). M. Hussein Naficy, of the Ministry of Finance. M. Khosrow Hedayet, manager of the Azerbaijan Railways and representing the Ministry of Communications.3 The second mission, also headed by M. Hamid Sayyah, will visit the All-Soviets Agricultural Exhibition, and is composed of MM. Mohamad Amini, Director of Cotton Purchasing Concerns, and Mohamad Bayat, of the Depart ment of Agriculture. The Soviet Ambassador gave a tea-party at the embassy in honour of the members of the two missions on the afternoon of the 23rd July. 9. German Interests. (i) About the middle of April the German Legation started testing a secret portable wireless transmitter-receiver. This instrument had been supplied by Messrs. Lorenz of Germany, and is a portable petrol electric ^ A.C., 110 -yolt apparatus. The instrument is used in conjunction with a “ Hell transmission. It was assembled by a Herr Mans, a Telefunken specialist in portable wireless military equipment, who was sent to Iran in connexion with the erection of broadcasting apparatus in Tehran supplied by his firm. Herr Maus also built a number of small portable sets from parts which had been smuggled in with the big broadcasting equipment and also by means of the German and Italian diplomatic bags. The German Legation portable wireless apparatus transmits on several frequencies—12-18 megacycles—at uncertain times during the day. (ii) The Tehran Chamber of Commerce have delegated M. Hassan Pirayesh as their official representative at the Leipzig Autumn Fair which opens at the end of August. 10. Italian Interests. (i) Steamship Hilda, of Lloyd-Triestino Line, which took refuge in Bandar Abbas on the outbreak of war with Italy, carried a large consignment of loaf sugar and military stores for Iran. Considerable difficulty was experienced in unloading the heavier military stores, as there are no cranes or other facilities at Bandar Abbas. Over twenty military lorries, as well as commandeered civilian transport, were sent to Bandar Abbas to carry these stores to the capital, where they have since been delivered. (ii) Several British firms in India and Iran have been approached for assistance in shipping arms and ammunition from the Italian steamship Arabia, at present at Assab, to an Iranian port. As these firms have declined to help, the Iranian Government are now trying to obtain the services of a Japanese vessel. 11. Egyptian Interests. During the period under review two articles on the present position of Egypt were published in the Tehran press which were hostile to Great Britain. In the first Egypt was described as a country whose interests were not engaged in the present war, but which had suffered from the present hostilities. It expressed the hope that the King of Egypt would find some means of putting an end to this unfortunate state of affairs and of rescuing his country from the disastrous storm. In a further article another newspaper stated that, up to the declaration of war by Italy, Egypt has maintained her neutrality, but that it became more and more difficult for her on account of the presence of the troops of her ally to maintain this position, and that she was being consumed in a war from which she drew no advantage. The writer added that every Iranian regretted that distance made it impossible for him to soften the trials and sufferings with which Egypt is afflicted—especially on the part of her ally. This article, which was probably written under the direction of the Shah, seems to have taken the Egyptian Ambassador completely by surprise. He has informed His Majesty’s Minister that in his view the article will greatly embarrass the King and Government of Egypt, to whom he is reporting the matter, and that he proposes to speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject. 12. Czechoslovak Interests. The news of the recognition of a Czecho-Slovak Government in London has caused general satisfaction in Czech circles, who hope that His Majesty’s Govern ment will permit their consular officers to look after Czech interests in Iran.4 13. Danish Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 11 (current), paragraph 8 . The Danish fishing trawler Crete Knopper arrived in Bandar Abbas on the 24th June and sailed for Khorramshahr on the 30th June to be laid up for the summer. 14. Trans-Iranian Railways. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company supply all the locomotive oil fuel for the v State Railways. This is delivered at Ahwaz and the distribution undertaken by the State Railway authorities. 15. Public Health. The Department of Public Health have a large construction programme of hospitals throughout Iran for the year 1940-41. The principal items of this are the construction of a hospital of 500 beds at Tehran, this building is situated 500 yards west of the Jelalieh race course and faces south-west. It is already in an advanced state of construction. A hospital of 100 beds in Isfahan, and one of similar capacity in Shiraz, and twenty-six other hospitals are also under construction throughout the provinces. 16. Enemy Propaganda German oral propaganda continues active throughout Iran and an anti- British feeling is being fomented by a well-trained body of German agents. The latter are, it would appear, striving to encourage discontented Iranians who form so large a percentage of the population to believe that most of the evils, economic, administrative, Ac., from which Iran is now suffering are directly attributable to the baleful influence exercised over the Shah, his Ministers and other officials by the British. The British, too, are alleged to be responsible for Reza Shah’s accession to power and to have encouraged him in his profligate and wasteful expenditures of the country’s resources during the past fifteen years; the misery, ruin, economic difficulties, high taxation, and increased cost of living are there fore directly the result of British evil influence. There is reason to believe that an increasingly large number of Iranians are ready to believe this. The local press is on the whole hostile. German and Italian news items are in most cases greatly in excess of British. Such articles as are writteU oh the world situation tend to exert an anti-British influence on local readers. German newspapers, and a well-produced propaganda picture paper called Signal, are on sale from newsagents. The latter paper is becoming increasingly popular. # « Persian broadcasts from Berlin continue to exercise a powerful influence over Iran and are largely instrumental in convincing the people of British weakness and the certainty of an eventual German victory. 17.

Tehran, August 13, 1940. C 1 /C 44 . £)0 l^l l o Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 16 for the Period ending August 10, 1940. 1 . The Shah and the Imperial Family. ON the 5 th August, at the Saadabad Palace, His Imperial Majesty the Shah received in audience Cabinet Ministers and twelve Deputies representing the Majlis. His Excellency M. Hassan Esfandiary (Mohtasham-us-Saltaneh), President of the Chamber, read a loyal address to the Shah on the occasion of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the granting of a Constitution in Iran. On the 6 th August His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Prince and Princess and the Princes Ali Reza, Ghulam Reza and Abdul Reza, left Tehran by car for the Imperial Rest House at Kalar Dasht in Mazanderan Province (Degree Sheet 8 P.B. 2). The Imperial party returned to the capital on the 9th August. Whilst at Kalar Dasht His Imperial Majesty the Shah visited the Chains silk factory. 2. Iranian Officials. On the 28th July his Excellency M. Ali Soheili, the newly appointed Minister of the Interior, arrived in Tehran from Kabul, where he had been ambassador. 3. Iranian Air Force. (i) On the 30th July two Hind aircraft from Qila Murgha Aerodrome collided whilst flying in formation. One of the aircraft crashed in the Tehran railway station goods yards, killing two civilians. The pilot had, however, baled out safely. The other aircraft managed to return to its aerodrome. (ii) It is reported that reserve military landing-grounds are being prepared at Sharifabad, about 67 kilom. along the Tehran-Veramin-Semnan road, and another within the Kerej area. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current), paragraph 4 (i). Mr. C. B. Field, the Airspeed (Limited) test-pilot, finally left Tehran for England on the 29th July, but not without considerable obstruction from the Iranian Air Force staff. (iv) The Imperial Government have asked the United States Charge d’Affaires whether the United States Government can facilitate the purchase of military aircraft in the United States, viz., thirty pursuit planes and fifty tosixty heavy bombers. They are now prepared to pay cash. They have also talked vaguely about the erection of an aircraft factory in Iran for the manu facture of American machines, but this scheme is apparently dependent on ine purchase of the American aircraft specified. 4. British Interests. (i) It is hoped that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company crisis will soon be settled. The company proposed that they should make advances to the Imperial Government for a period of three years, such as to bring the royalties up to a specified figure, repayment to begin when the royalties calculated according to the terms of the concession actually reached that figure, and to be effective out of the excess over that figure. This was not satisfactory to the Imperial Govern ment, who feel that the falling off of royalties is due to the policy of His Majesty’s Government, and the agreement will probably provide for the payment of such sums calculated in the manner explained above, but not recoverable. The Imperial Government have no objection to the formulation of any reserves the company think necessary in order to preserve their concessional rights. (ii) Six British Indian locomotive drivers, working under contract for the Iranian State Railways and employed on the southern section, have received notices from the railway administration informing them that, unless they adopt Iranian nationality, they will be replaced by Iranians. No such notice has been served on other foreigners employed in the same section of the Trans-Iranian Railway. Enquiries are being made into this apparent case of discrimination. 5. Anglo-Iranian OH Company. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 14 (current), paragraph 8 . The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but it is now almost certain that it was due to an electric spark. Welding was going on 15 miles down the line, and it has been proved that a faulty connexion in the process of welding will cause a spark to jump in a coupling at least 3 miles away. It is also possible that the pipe-line had become charged with static electricity by the friction of the oil and of impurities in the form of grit passing through it. 6 . French Interests. Acting on instructions from the Ministry of War at Vichy, the French Military Attache has demobilised the two French Reserve officers attached to his staff, and the extra clerical assistance engaged on the outbreak of the war. The French Military Attache now has only one clerk and a typist in his office. He has been ordered to render his reports as in peace time direct to the French General Staff. He is apparently not in touch with the French military authorities in Beirut. 7. German Interests. For the past month German activity in Iran has been very much under the surface. There is no longer talk of the German “ Fifth Column ” in Iran and it seems that the German colony has received strict orders to show that they are really interested in commercial activity in Iran. This commercial drive is very strong. The German Legation has officially asked the Iranian authorities, as well as firms of neutral countries under their protection, to send enquiries to them for all kinds of goods they may require, and promise to supply these quickly and at moderate rates. Since Molotov’s speech, however, German political activity is reported again to be rising. 8 . Soviet Interests. (i) Consternation was caused in Iranian official circles by the reference in M. Molotov’s speech to the alleged flight over Baku of two foreign aeroplanes coming from the direction of Iran, towards the end of March. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told His Majesty’s Minister that this accusation had been made3 at the time and the Imperial Government had given the Soviet Government a denial and had thought that the matter was closed. What particularly annoyed the Imperial Government was that M. Molotov said that the Imperial Government “ Had thought it necessary to deny the report ”—a form of words which appeared to cast doubt upon the genuineness of the Imperial Government s dementi. An article to this effect appeared in a Tehran newspaper, and it is nmown that the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to the Soviet Ambassador in similar terms. (ii) A list of civil and military aerodromes in the Caucasus area, dated April 1940, is given as an appendix to this summary^ 1 ) 9. Egyptian Interests. No more articles about Egypt have appeared. His Majesty’s Minister spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about articles hostile to Great Britain w r hich had appeared in the press, and mentioned in particular the two about Egypt. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a feeble attempt to assert that the press enjoyed “ a certain freedom,” but otherwise made no defence. This was not surprising as the articles had obviously been inspired by the Shah’s family feeling. 10. Czecho-Slovakian Interests. Notes, furnished by Czechs newly arrived in Iran, on present conditions in the Reich protectorates are given as an appendix to this summary.Q 11 . Iranian State Railways. The railway station buildings of Shahrud are already in an advanced state of construction. A special road, 4 kilom. long, is being made between the railway- station and the town of Shahrud itself (Map 15.D.4). 12. Aero Club. (i) On the 30th July the local press reported in large head-lines that further large donations from all the members of the Imperial Family had been sent to the funds of the Aero Club. The total sum donated amounted to 245,000 rials (£4,099 at the rate of 60 rials per £). (ii) Enquiries are being made from Japanese aircraft firms for the supply of 20-25 machines for the use of the aero club. • 13. Census. An Imperial decree orders the Minister of the Interior to arrange for the early taking of the census of the population of Meshed and Tabriz. 14. Movements of Members of Foreign Missions. Recently the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent a circular to all foreign embassies and legations stating that, since it is strictly forbidden for anyone to proceed to the frontiers of Iran without obtaining permission in advance, members of foreign missions are also requested not to proceed to the vicinity of the frontiers of Imperial territory unless special permission has been obtained in writing. The Soviet Ambassador is believed to have protested against this order and asked for reasons. According to the Soviet Military Attache, the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that it was because the French had been active in taking photographs of the Azerbaijan and Khorassan frontiers. 15. Youth Organisations. The usual instructional camps for Boy Scout masters and Girl Guide Com missioners have been in progress throughout the summer at Manzarieh near Tehran. Swimming and diving classes have also been held at the above place during the summer and stress had been laid on this sport in the local newspapers. Within the past two years several new and well-equipped public and private swimming- baths have been constructed both in Tehran and in several of the larger towns of the provinces.

Tehran. August 24, 1940. (Secret.) Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 17 for the Period ending August 24. 1940. 1 . The Shah and the Imperial Family. His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence in the summer palaces at Saadabad. The Shah has been seen on several occasions in the city, accompanied by his usual guard of three police officer motor cyclists. It is said that one of the Deputies (Syed Yakub) who waited on His Imperial Majesty the Shah at the Saadabad Palace on the 5th August (vide Intelligence Summary No. 16, current, paragraph 1 ) remarked to the Shah during an informal conversation after the ceremony that the industrial progress of Iran was being held up as no machinery was being delivered from Europe, and that His Imperial Majesty replied that it was all the fault of the British; Hitler, although he had been victorious, had generously offered to make peace, but the British Government, such was their greed and avidity, had rejected this peace and would go on fighting. On the 23rd August His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince attended the finals of the All-Iran Open Swimming Sports at the Manzarieh Swimming Pool. 2 . Iranian Officials. It is stated that Sarhang (Colonel) Salar, now director of the powder factory at Parchin, will be appointed to the Berne Purchasing Committee. 3. Iranian Army. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), paragraph 3 (v). This report is incorrect. (ii) Collective training preparatory to manoeuvres is being carried out by the Tehran garrison from their summer training camps. On the 12th August His Imperial Majesty the Shah himself watched several units on field training. It is said that the Shah was accompanied by the German Military Attache, but confirmation of this is still awaited. (iii) A certain number (said to be about 100) of the elderly and senior officers are to be transferred to pension. (iv) On the 5th August the British manager of the Imperial Bank at Meshed saw near Shahrud proceeding along the Meshed road the following column of artillery :— 3 batteries 75-mm. mountain. 3 guns 105-mm. short. 4 anti-aircraft guns. 27 lorries of ammunition.2 The artillery looked new. No report of their arrival in Meshed has yet been received, but it is possible that these reinforcements may have gone direct to the frontier garrisons in Northern Khorasan. (v) Divisions in the provinces are being steadily equipped with clothing, armament, munitions, &amp;c., from the Tehran arsenals. A large consignment of light and heavy machine guns has recently been sent to the 14th (Kerman) Division. (vi) A special commission is now in session at the Ministry of War for the purpose of weeding out over-age and inefficient officers from the army. (vii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 9 (1939), paragraph 6 . Czech sources report that over eight months ago the Iranian military authorities placed an order with the German Government for the supply of seventy R.V. six-wheeled service armoured motor vehicles built by Czecho-Moravska. The delivery of these vehicles is considerably delayed. 4. Iranian Air Force. (i) Four Hawker Hind aircraft were recently sent to Ahwaz to reinforce the 4th Air Regiment. The total aircraft now in Ahwaz is twenty. (ii) On the 11 th July an Audax aircraft from Mehrabad military aerodrome, flying low in the foothills of the Elburz Mountains north of Tehran, crashed. The pilot was killed and the machine completely wrecked. (iii) A landing-ground is being prepared near Madar-i-Shah (million sheet 9, D. 3) on the Isfahan-Qum road. At Madar-i-Shah there is a very large and old Sarai, which is now occupied by troops. The place has recently been declared a military area. Various other new landing-grounds in Azerbaijan and Khorasan are reported to have been prepared for aircraft, but confirmation is still awaited. 5. British Interests. (i) The secret police have recently redoubled their watch on His Majesty’s Legation. (ii) It is hoped that the controversy between the Iranian Government and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company will be settled in a few days by an agreement providing for increased payments to the Iranian Government in respect of the years 1938 to 1941. (iii) The medium-wave broadcast in Persian from Delhi having proved ineffective, a short-wave service giving a daily bulletin in Persian was inaugurated on the 16th August. 6 . Ancjlo-Iranian Oil Company. The new pipe-line from Gach Saran (Million Sheet 10 , D. 2 ) is now working. 400,000 gallons per day are being delivered from this field. This is only one-fifth of the present pipe-line’s capacity, and all further pipe-line construction has therefore been temporarily suspended. 7. Soviet Interests. (i) It is reported that a branch line has been constructed between Tejend (Million Sheet 28, B.3) on the Trans-Caspian Railway to Sarrakhs (Soviet) (Million Sheet 28, B.4). (ii) A certain Mme. Lilian, imprisoned six years ago on charges of espionage on behalf of Soviet Russia, has recently been released from prison. Mme. Lilian used to own a photographic studio in the centre of Tehran. (iii) Reports from Moscow state that the Iranian Missions there have not met with the reception they anticipated or desired. It is learnt that two of the Transport Commission members were warned to proceed to Moscow as members of a commission only a few days before the commissions actually left Iran, and that no preliminary discussions or meetings took place in Iran. 8 . Turkish Interests. The Turkish Ambassador finds, after nearly a year in Iran, that he can get nothing done because of the obstructiveness of the Iranian authorities. He is particularly annoyed by the failure of the Iranian Government to implement3 the provisions of the Frontier Convention of 1937 : the periodical meetings between frontier officials never take place because the Iranians will not come, and no attempt has been made by the Iranian Government to remove undesirables from areas near the frontier. 9. Iraqi Interests. According to the Iraqi Charge d'Affaires, no progress whatever has been made with the delimitation of the land frontier between Iraq and Iran. He says that the Iranian representative is an aged man, who never agrees to go to the points wffiere boundary pillars ought to be erected. He believes that the Iranian Government are deliberately delaying the work because they wish to secure their gains in the Shatt-el-Arab region, and that if the river portion of the frontier were delimited first the Iranian Government would never take any interest in the land frontier. The head of the Iraqi half of the Iraqi-Iran Delimitation Commission has come to Tehran to try to smooth out the difficulties. 10. Italian Interests. The Italian Minister has complained in public that his efforts on behalf of Italian trade are constantly baffled by the German Minister, and that if this continues he will complain to his Government. Personal relations between the two ministers are difficult, because the Italian is a Roman Catholic and the German indulges in vulgar anti-religious abuse. 11. German Interests. (1) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 12 (current), Appendix A. The following additions, amendments, and errata are notified :— Block Hochtieff (Construction Company)— Block wart J. Wiedermann. Block Varnak (gas mask factory)— Blockwart Vollbrecht. Organisation of Nazi leaders— No. 9. For Widemann, J., read Wiedermann, J. (ii) A Herr Goeritz, specialist in locomotives and lately discharged from the German Tank Corps, in which he was a sergeant, states that the German tanks carry a limited quantity of special armour-piercing ammunition marked with a red ring for use on pill-boxes, &amp;c. (iii) German literature and pictorial propaganda papers continue to arrive quickly and regularly in considerable quantities in Iran. These consist in part of the following publications, all extremely well produced :—■ a) i ran-i-Nou, in Persian, edited by Shahrukh. (2) Signal. War pictorial in all European languages. (3) Rien que la Verite, in French. (4) Weltluftmacht Deutschland, in German, French and English. As no newspaper mails have been received in Iran from England for the past eight weeks, no counter-propaganda is possible at present. 12. Obituary. His Excellency Ali Quli Ansari, Mushavir-ul-Mamalik ((Military Attache’s Personalities No. 30 and Foreign Office Personalities No. 23), died at Tehran on the 13th August. His eldest son, Abdul Hussein Massoud Ansari, is Iranian Consul-General at New Delhi. 13. Movements of Members of Foreign Missions. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 16, paragraph 14. As certain foreign legations have requested an explanation of this restriction, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs now states that the order applies only to the frontiers of Azerbaijan and Gurgan.4 14. Communications. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 10, paragraph 9. Isfahan^Azna Route .—A consular report from Isfahan states that the new Isfahan-Azna route will not be completed until the middle of next year, despite press reports and .A- assurances to the contrary given to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Sections this road as far as Dumbineh (Million Sheet 9, C.3) have been completed, buC' from thence to Azna the road is a mere mule-track. The alignment avoids Khunsar, turning west at Dumbineh. During the winter the road will be liable to snow blocks, as it is high and exposed in some stretches. An interesting feature is that the road is being constructed like a permanent-way, which seems to indicate that a branch line may eventually be constructed between Azna and Isfahan. (ii) Quetta-Nushki-Nokkundi-Zahidan Railway .—Oral enquiries have been made by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as to whether the Government of India are prepared to recommission the line between Nokkundi and Qila Safed (Mirjawa). If this is so, the Imperial Government will recommission the line on their side of the frontier from Mirjawa to Zahidan. 15. Iranian State Railways. Tabriz Branch .—On the 13th August this line was formally opened to traffic as far as Sultanieh (Million Sheet 8 , A.4), 39 kilom. from Zinjan. Iff. The Boui 'se. The construction of an immense Stock Exchange has begun in Tehran. The site chosen for this building consists of an area of more than 350,000 square metres in the centre of Tehran. Commercial firms are expected to construct new premises in close proximity. A special exhibition hall will also be built which will permanently house an exhibition of Iranian products. 17. Foreign Fjducational Establishments. In accordance with the orders given by H.I.M. the Shah in September of last year (vide Intelligence Summary No. 17, 1939, paragraph 6 ) that all foreign- run educational establishments should be handed over to the Ministry of Education, the well-known American college at Tehran, now known as the Lycee Elburz, and other American schools at Hamadan, Resht and Tabriz have now been formally handed over. The Imperial Government has agreed to pay the sum of $1,200,000 in four equal instalments to the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America as compensation. 18. Landing-Grounds in South and Central Iran. A list of landing-grounds in South and Central Iran is given as an appendix to this Summary. The maps contained in the Military Report on the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company Oilfield Area, 1938, should be consulted for the location of several of these landing-grounds. H. J.

Tehran, September 7, 1940. ^ ^ /z^&gt; • 2 //&amp;(S'a/Ztsm Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 18, for the Period ending September 7, 1940. ( 1 ) The Shah and the Imperial Family. H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence in the summer palaces at Saadabad. On the 1st September (the anniversary of the prophet) the Shah, attended by H.I.H. the Crown Prince, held his usual levee at the Gulistan Palace. (2) Iranian Army. (i) On the 21st August the Tehran garrison returned to barracks from the respective training camps preparatory to proceeding on manoeuvres. Reports state that the troops were not properly fed during this year’s training camps. (ii) On the 26th, 27th and 28th August the major portion of the Tehran garrison proceeded by route march to the manoeuvre concentration area near Qazvin, 90 miles from Tehran. All marching is being carried out at night. The Turkish Military Attache (Captain Osman Canberk) has received an invitation to attend the manoeuvres on a date to be specified later and at twenty- four hours’ notice. As usual, the remainder of foreign military attaches have been completely ignored. Manoeuvres are to be carried out in the area between Qazvin and Hamadan, near Jafarabad (M.S. 9.B.I.) and are to last for about a fortnight. Aircraft are to be based on both these towns respectively. It is stated that the main object of the manoeuvres this year is to test out the system of supply in the field. (iii) A further number of senior officers of the rank of Sarhang (colonel) have been transferred to pension on the recommendation of the special commission (vide Intelligence Summary No. 17, current, paragraph 3 (vi)). (iv) Reserve class 1285 (1907), having completed one month’s refresher training, has been discharged (Intelligence Summary No. 15, paragraph 3 (iii)). (3) Iranian Air Force. The majority of the Audax and Tiger Moth machines based on Mehrabad Flying School are now over six years old and are becoming unserviceable and dangerous for further use. [12—25] *2 (4) British Interests. The controversy between the Iranian Government and the Anglo-Iranian OT Company has been settled by an agreement reached on the 21 st August. By it the company has agreed that in order to mitigate the effects of circumstances outside the company’s control as a result of which the revenues from oil fallen, it will pay to the Imperial Government on the 31st August, 1940, £1,500,000 sterling, and will make up the sums due on account of royalty tonnage, dividend participation, taxation and gold premium, to £4 million sterling m total in respect of each of the years 1940 and 1941. With regard to the period after 1941 it is agreed that the differences between the parties in respect of the Imperial Government’s claims will be examined at that time with a view to reaching an arrangement acceptable to both parties. The immediate object of His Majesty’s Government in dealing with this question was to gain time. This has been achieved by a gift of money and without sacrificing any part of the company’s concession. In view of this and of the fact that differences in regard to foreign exchange, which it is important to resolve by direct negotiations between the two Governments, are not mentioned in the agreement, the latter 1 may be regarded as satisfactory. Nevertheless, by the unscrupulous, and even offensive, manner in which the Shah has pressed his claims, he has entirely alienated the sympathy of His Majesty's Legation and of the company's local representative. It is also satisfactory that no new commitments have been assumed in regard to any time subsequent to the end of 1941. What happens after 1941 will depend mainly on the strength of the British Empire in the Middle East at that time. ( 5 ) French Interests. (i) The French Military Attache is in close touch both with Beyrouth and France by means of a receiving set installed in his private residence. He employs a French wireless operator. He openly declares that the only news which he accepts and is prepared to listen to is that emanating officially from the Vichy Government. (ii) The French Military Attache has recently received a sum in dollars for expenditure on Second Bureau work. He is again reorganising his agents, &amp;c., with little regard to cost. (iii) Since the signing of the armistice members of the French Legation, including the French Military Attache, remain friendly and have endeavoured to show outwardly that this has not affected their relations with the British. At the same time they definitely take their orders from the Vichy Government, and in some cases have expressed criticism of British action ringed with hostility and bitterness. Recently several booklets, viz., La Verite sur VArmistice, La Verite sur I’Oran, &amp;c., were passed to members of the French colony, which apparently caused the French Legation displeasure. To counter its effect the French Legation distributed a typewritten sheet containing an article on “ Measures militaires ” culled from the Journal de Geneve, dated the 12th July. Three members of the French Mission have recently received intimation from Vichy that they have been advanced in grade. ( 6 ) Italian Interests. His Excellency the Italian Minister, dissatisfied with his sources of intelligence, has recently organised a special intelligence service for the Italian Legation. Amongst those employed as agents are Cabella, a tennis professional, and Ciampi, a chauffeur. Their special duty is to watch and report on the activities of both the French and British Legations. Both of these men have been domiciled in Iran for a long time and are well-known characters. (7) German Interests. (i) Herr Dittman, counsellor of the German Legation and a devout Roman Catholic, is said to be much exasperated by the sneering anti-religious views expressed by the German Minister (Herr Ettel), but dare not protest openly. (ii) German engineers of the Telefunken Company, who some months ago installed the radio apparatus of the Tehran Broadcasting Station, have3 consistently refused so far formally to hand over the equipment to the Mmisti\ of Posts and Telegraphs, always claiming that the apparatus was unsatisfactory j and required still further testing and adjustment, &amp;c. Two engineers have now j been given permission to reside within the broadcasting station itselt undei the j pretext that they can more easily adjust the apparatus at night after thej ^ termination of the broadcasting programme. ( 8 ) U.S.S.R. Interests. According to several reports, the official Iranian Mission at Moscow have made no progress in their negotiations over transport and transit facilities between Iran and Russia. They complain that the Soviet Government aie indifferent to their presence and continually postpone meetings. (9) Danish Interests. M. A. C. Fensmark, the Danish Charge d Affaires, who at first disregarded instructions received from Copenhagen to maintain relations with the Geiman Legation, has been unable to maintain this position. His attitude has been governed by his desire to help the Danish community in Iran, many of whom have offered help in one form or other to the Allied cause, but also by the fear that, if he continued to hold out, he would very likely be remo\ed and leplaced by a pro-German official. When, therefore, the demand that he should co-opeiate with the German Legation was recently withdrawn and he was instructed only to adopt a neutral attitude to all countries, including Germany, he decided to comply. ( 10 ) Iranian Officials. (i) His Excellency M. Hussain Samiyi, Abid-us-Saltaneh (M.A.'s Personali ties No. 254. and F.O’. Personalities No. 181) has been appointed ambassador at Kabul. „ , „ . , (ii) M. Mohd Ghaffari (Kamal-ul-Mulk), the well-known Iranian painter, recently died at the age of 95 at Nishapur. (11) Ship-repairing Facilities in the Caspian. On the 18th August the contractors, Messrs. Julius Berger (a German firm), formally made over to the Imperial Government the ship-repairing yard which they have constructed at Bandar Pahlevi. I he contract price was for 12 million rials (£200,000 approximately). The shipway is capable of lifting out of the water ships up to 1,500 tons. The length of the slipway is stated to be 182 metres and breadth 13 metres. (12) Delhi Short- Wave Broadcast. The reception in Tehran of the new Delhi broadcasts in Persian on the 49 -metre band on alternate days is moderate and still somewhat affected by atmospherics. The Persian of the announcer is strictly correct and suitable. (13) Minerals. (i) Active exploitation of a copper mine at Baghcheh Bagh, between Zinjan and Mianeh (Map M.S. 1 and 8 ), has begun. The ore, which is stated to contain 6 per cent, copper, is despatched to the refinery at Ghain Abad, near Tehran. (ii) According to the press, a rich rock crystal mine has been discovered at Azandarvan, near Malayir (M.S. 9.A.2). (14) Press. Since the visit of H.I.M. the Crown Prince and members of the Imperial Family to the All-Iran Open Swimming Sports held under the auspices of the Iranian boy scout organisation at Manzarieh, near Tehran, there has been a delude of articles and photographs in the press on such subjects as “ Our Louth, “Our Girls,” “Swimming in Iran,” “Our Prowess at Swimming, - Boy Scouting,' &amp;c. (15) United States Interests. Mr Cornelius van H. Engert, counsellor and charge d’affaires ad interim of the United States Legation, has been appointed consul-general at Beyrouth. He will take up his new anpointment in November.(16) Japanese Interests. (i) His Excellency Mr. Shoichi Nakayama, the Japanese Minister in Tehran, has been recalled to Japan. He is among the forty-odd Japanese diplomats who are now being replaced throughout the world. (ii) Lieutenant-Colonel Tomo Takasina, the Japanese Military and Air Attach^, expects to be relieved shortly. (17) Finance. The recent calling in of English banknotes revealed that large sums were held by the German colony, as well as individual Iranians. The Imperial Bank alone took in over £5,000. The total for Iran is stated to be about £37,000. H. J. UNDERWOOD. Lieutenant-Colonel. Military Attache. Tehran, September 7, 1940.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL.

' -7 Tehran, September 21, 1940. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 19 for the Period ending September 21, 1940. (Secret.) 1. 'The Shah and the Imperial Family. (i) On the 8 th September H.I.M. the Shah, accompanied by H.I.H. the Crown Prince, left Tehran by the Imperial train for Takestan (Siahdahan) via Qazvin. On arrival the Imperial party left immediately by motor-car for Ab-i-Garm Kharagha. H.I.M. the Shah returned to the capital by train on the 11 th September, when he was met at the station by the Imperial Princes. Cabinet Ministers and other high officials. (ii) During the absence of H.I.M. the Shah and H.I.H. the Crown Prince, their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Princess Fowzieh and Princess Shahdukht Pahlevi dined incognito at a small foreign restaurant in Tehran. The Crown Princess announced to the proprietrix her intention of continuing her patronage and asked that her incognito should always be strictly observed. 2 . Iranian Officials. M. Ali Asghar Forouzan has been appointed acting Head of the Tehran Municipality vice M. Ghulam Hussein Ibtehaj (Military Attache’s Personalities. No. 117), relieved. 3. Iranian Army. (i) The following troops of the Tehran Central Garrison carried out their annual manoeuvres from the 8 th September to the 10 th September inclusive in the vicinity of Jafarabad (Degree Sheet 9.E.A.1). approximately 140 miles by road from Tehran :— 1st Infantry Division. Hnd Infantry Division. 1st Cavalry Division. Mechanised Brigade. The scheme consisted of an approach march and an attack by (red) one infantry division and one mechanised brigade from the direction of Qazvin against (blue) two infantry divisions, one cavalry division, and one motorised battalion, who were holding two defensive lines as under : first defensive line astride the main Qazvin-Hamadan road at Sadiqabad (Degree Sheet 9.E.B.1). second defensive, line astride the road near Hisar. Red captured the first position, but were later counter-attacked by blue’s superior forces and driven back towards Nahavand. Blue cavalry, supported by its motorised battalion, carried out a wide flanking movement around red’s left flank via Yanki Kaleh and Jehanabad (Degree Sheet 9.E.B.1 and 9.E.C.1). [11—12] PCCo.

I he spectators, who included all provincial general officers commanding, viewed the operations from several convenient hillocks close to the main road and did not require to he mounted. His Imperial Majesty reviewed the troops before leaving and appeared satisfied with what he had seen. It was noted that no blank ammunition was used and no bayonets carried. Both sides were allotted a squadron of aircraft each, but little notice was taken Jp by either side of aircraft. A (red) tank attack was supported by bombing aircraft. I lie taking of aerial photographs and message-dropping was also practised. The supply organisation appeared to work well, but as there was not much movement it cannot be said that much experience was gained. The manoeuvres terminated rather earlier than anticipated, which naturally ga\e rise to many rumours. One is that the Soviet Ambassador, acting on instructions from Moscow, asked for an explanation of why this year the manoeuvres were held so unusually distant from Tehran and why the scheme consisted mainly of the defensive against an enemy coming from the north. It is hoped to give further details in the next summary. (ii) Gurgan district has been declared a military area. It is now extremely difficult for Europeans and also Iranians to obtain permits to enter this zone. (ni) A new regiment of artillery (number at present unknown) has been formed of the sixteen 150-mm. (5-9-in.) guns recently delivered from Germany. 4. German Interests. (i) The German seamen of all the five interned Hansa Line steamers have now returned from their rest camps near Tehran. (ii) Two different sources report that a Qaiar Prince, said to be Mohammed Hassan Mirza (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 224, and Foreign Office Personalities, iSo. 164). is in Berlin, where he is gathering followers. (hi) On the 7th September the German Military Attache, Major von Geldern Crespendqrff, left for Berlin to attend a conference of military attaches. He was accompanied by his sister. Fraulein Frika von Geldern Crespendorff. who may not return as she has resigned all her appointments in the Brown House. ( 1V ) It 18 reported in German circles that the former German Minister in lehran, Dr. Smend, is now in a German concentration camp Dr Grobba the former German Minister in Bagdad, is also in disgrace. 5. Italian Interests. Italian seamen have now' all returned to their ships from Tehran. The Iranian naval director at Bandar Shahpur is not impressed with the movement of strength through Joy ” as he is in constant and daily attendance on all who have returned. Several Somali seamen are causing trouble and strenuous efforts are being made to repatriate them. The master of steamship Bronte, who is an ex-nayal officer, has been given telegraphic instructions to take on board as much oil as he could obtain. The steamship Bronte is a tanker navy grey m colour. Lnusual quantities of water have recently been pumped on board and about 80 tons of oil. ^ r r 6 . Czechoslovak Interests. A note on the Czechs in Iran is given as appendix (A)(') to this summary. 7. Danish Interests. M. O. Konstantin-Hansen of the Fish Canning Factory, Band left Denmark at the end of July, has been interviewed by His Ma Kerman. As several of M. Hansen’s statements are interesting t m appendix (B)(’) to this summary. 8 . Soviet Interests. (i) It is stated on reliable authority that the Soviet insist on the Germans paying railway fares and freight charges in United States dollars. (n) 1 he Turkish military attache believes that the Soviet are once again concentrating troops in the Caucasus. &amp; (iii) Iranian employees of the Iran-Soviet Caspian Sea Fisheries Board are gradually being replaced by Soviet nationals. ar Abbas, who jesty’s Consul, hey are shown3 (g5 9. Bulgarian Interests. A Bulgarian resident in Iran proposed to the Bulgarian Charge d'Affaires that tin, rubber, tea and spices should be imported into Bulgaria from the Netherlands East Indies through Iran, and this suggestion was passed on to the ^^Netherlands Minister, who consulted His Majesty’s Minister. Owing to the risk that such goods might reach enemy territory His Majesty's Minister informed the Foreign Office. It is understood that any applications for such trade will be considered in London. According to the Bulgarian Charge d’Affaires, the route would he through Turkey to Trebizond, not through Soviet Russia. 10 . Commerce. (i) It is stated that H.I.M. the Shah has given strict orders to the Ministry of Finance, &amp;c., that regardless of cost they must buy in Germany so as to reduce the adverse balance on clearing of 30-40 million Reichsmarks. Recently the order for a special make of crane for the port of Bandar Shah was deliberately placed with Germany in spite of their tender being the highest of all. (ii) Five thousand tons of cotton are being bought by Hungary, and 1,000 tons by Italy. Shipments have begun to be made by the Tabriz—Trebizond route. 12,000 bales of cotton are now lying in the open at Babulsar and Bandar Pahlevi awaiting shipment to Germany. The Soviet have so far refused all transit facilities—the pretext being that it contained boll-worm and also that there was a shortage of rolling-stock. (iii) H.I.M. the Shah has given orders that two rice depots of 20.000 tons each must be constructed with the least possible delay at Gurgan and Bandar Gaz. (iv) Messrs. Ferrostahl, contractors for the Kerej Blast Furnaces, expect delivery of the machinery required at the port of Nou Shahr within the next six weeks. From Nou Shahr it will be brought to Kerej by the Chains road. 11 . Communications. According to the press the Meshed-Sarrakhs (Iranian) road has been realigned and repaired, especially where it crosses the Mazdaran Pass (Degree Sheet 28.D.C.4). The road has been widened at this point to 6 metres and all bridges are now built of stone masonry or concrete. The road is now suitable for all classes of motor transport. 12. The Press. The Iranian press has been roused to fury over the report that a Swedish and an American newspaper have been permitted to publish articles on Iran containing incorrect and vulgar remarks about their august and well-beloved sovereign. The press state that they await the arrival of these low, base and ignoble articles before returning to the attack. Lengthy articles on current sporting events, such as the All-Iran Athletic Championship and Cyclist Races, continue to fill columns in the newspapers. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Tehran, September 21, 1940.

Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received November 30.) (No. 210. Secret.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 20 for the period ending the 5th October, 1940, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, October 4, 1940. Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 20 for the Period ending October 5, 1940. (1) The Shah and the Imperial Family. ON the 20th September H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family returned to the Imperial Palaces in Tehran from Saadabad. On the 23rd September H.I.M. the Shah, accompanied by H.I.H. the Crown Prince, visited the Staff College (Ecole superieure de Guerre). The Imperial party were received by the Chief of the General Staff, Sarlashgar (Major-General) Zarghami. On the 24th September H.I.M. the Shah, accompanied by H.I.H. the Crown Prince, were present at the Officers' School (Fcole superieure des Officiers) for the annual &lt;£ passing-out ” ceremony and prize-giving. It is rumoured that during the night of the 25th-26th September three armed men were discovered by a sentry hiding in one of the new palaces now under construction within the grounds of the Imperial Palace. A search was immediately carried out and the whole Palace area was surrounded by a cordon of police and armed detectives. (2) Iranian Officials. (i) M. Amanullah Ardalan (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 33, and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 27) has been appointed Ustandar Governor- General) of the VI Department (Khuzistan). (ii) M. Jawad Sinaki (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 280, and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 199), Governor of Tehran, has been relieved of his appointment. It is rumoured that he is to return to the diplomatic service. (iii) M. Abbas Quli Ardalan has been appointed head of the Exchange Commission. (iv) His Excellency M. Baqir Kazemi (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 142, and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 108), the Iranian Ambassador at Angora, has been recalled. Rumour connects this with the desire the Shah is believed to feel to draw closer to Turkey, and in consequence to have a more ! t capable representative at Angora. (3) Iranian A rmy. (i) Messrs. Krupp have offered, through Messrs. Ferrostahl, twenty batteries of modern 75-mm. guns complete with motorised transport. The offer specifies that the guns will be delivered with pneumatic tyres, but not the transport vehicles. This material may originally have been Polish. [12-3]2 (ii) At the recent manoeuvres seventy-eight tanks, both medium and light, were employed. An unfortunate accident occurred at Takistan during the unloading of a light tank from a motor lorry. A colonel G.S.O., instructor of the Ecole superieure de Guerre (Stafi College) v^as run over, sustaining a compound fracture of the leg. A subaltern of the Tank Battalion (Lieutenant Ali Zulqadem) who went to his assistance smashed his right hand. Helio' signalling was carried out by both sides. Little effort, however, was made to conceal the signal stations. As the manoeuvres had been rumoured to last for ten days, there was surprise when they were brought to an abrupt conclusion by order of H.I.M. the Shah after only two and a half days. (iii) The following general officers were in command during the manoeuvres : — Sarlashgar (Major-General) Hidayat, Director. Sartip (Brigadier) Isfandiari. G.O.C. Red Force. Sartip (Brigadier) Jahanshahi, G.O.C. Blue Force. (iv) Twenty-five new Demag Diesel-engined troop-carrying vehicles were observed at the manoeuvres. (v) Enquiries are being made in Japan for the purchase of land mines and tanks, as well as a large quantity of dynamite. (vi) On the 23rd September H.I.M. the Shah, accompanied by H.I.H. the Crown Prince, were present at the Staff College (Ecole superieure de Guerre) for the annual prize-giving ceremony. The Imperial party were received by Sarlashgar (Major-General) Zarghami, C.G.S., who proceeded to read the annual report of the college’s activities. The Shah then briefly addressed the graduates and presented diplomas. (vii) On the 24th September H.I.M. the Shah, accompanied by H.I.H. the Crown Prince, attended the annual “promotion” or “passing-out” ceremony of the senior term cadets at the Officers’ College. Sarlashgar (Major-General) Yazdan Panah (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 301, and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 212), Commandant of the College, read the annual report, after which the Shah addressed the newly-commissioned officers and presented special prizes. The number of cadets who were granted commissions is as follows : — Commissioned second-lieutenants— Infantry ... 123 Cavalry ... 68 Artillery ... 52 Engineers 15 Mechanised forces 6 Commissioned as third-lieutenants— 264 Infantry ... 35 Cavalry ... 25 Artillery 25 Engineers 15 Commissioned as third-lieutenants (reserve)— 100 Infantry ... 163 Cavalry ... 100 Artillery ... 60 Engineers 40 363 After the ceremony the Shah closely inspected the new buildings of the college and left after a visit of three and a half hours for the Imperial Palace. A soiree was given later in the evening at the Officers’ School, at which a comedy was played by the Cadet Officers’ Dramatic Society.3 b 2 [12-3] (*)Not printed. (viii) The British Military Attache, on behalf of the foreign military attaches in Tehran, applied in writing to the Minister of War for permission for them to be present otiicially at the promotion ceremony of the Officers’ College in the presence of H.I.M. the Shah. Permission was refused, as, it was stated, the ceremony was one entirely connected with the internal affairs of the country. (ix) Sarlashgar (Major-General) Ahmed Muini, G.O.C. IV Division (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 174, and Foreign Office Personalities, No. 128), has been sent on a special mission to Berlin. (4) Iranian Air Force. (i) On the 23rd September one of the three Air Speed Oxford machines crashed on landing at the Doshantappeh aerodrome. H.I.M. the Shah has given orders that it must be repaired within three months. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (current), paragraph 4. On the 3rd October the fifth “ Hind ” machine to be erected at the Shahbaz Aircraft Factory at Doshantappeh successfully completed its test flight. It is now confidently expected that the remaining fifteen machines will be delivered before March 1941. (iii) Fifty young aircraft apprentices from the Apprentices School have now been introduced into the aircraft factory and a similar number of trained mechanics discharged. As the factory is already short Ox 246 mechanics, this will still further slow up construction work. (iv) Since the beginning of September, Sarhang (Colonel) Mohanna, the officer commanding the aircraft factory, personally visits the factory daily and frequently orders workers to be publicly flogged. (v) Buildings for personnel, stores. Ac., of the Bomber Command, now being erected on the north side of the Doshantappeh aerodrome and close to the Tehran- Meshed road, are now nearing completion. The hangars have not yet been begun, as material, &amp;c., is awaited from Messrs. Boulton Paul and Co. (Limited), of England. (5) Iranian State Railways. Tehrarv-Tabriz-Turkish Frontier Branch. —On the 4th October this branch was formally opened for traffic as far as Zinjan (million sheet 8.A.4). The total distance from Tehran is 315 kilom. (6) British Interests. (i) For some time negotiations have been in progress with His Majesty’s Government for the conversion into gold in Ottawa of sterling funds held by the Imperial Government in London. His Majesty’s Government have made a generous offer, but discussion of the details has been delayed and confused by the dilatory methods of the Iranian Minister in London and by the tendency of the Ministry of Finance to work through several different channels besides the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, e.g., the Midland Bank in London, and even the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. On Wednesday, the 26th September, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent in an ultimatum saying that, unless certain demands, neither of which had been made through the diplomatic channel, were complied with within a week, the Imperial Government would conclude that its aims could not be achieved and that this might upset the recent arrangement concluded with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. (ii) The press attache of His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran (Miss A. K. Lambton), recently travelled to Bagdad by hired motor car, in which a senior Iranian military officer was also travelling as far as Kermanshah. A summary of his conversation is given as Appendix “ B ’’O to this summary. (7) German Interests. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 (current), paragraph 4 (iii). It appears that relations between Major von Geldern Crespondorff, the German Military Attache, and the German Minister, Herr Ettel, have not been harmonious. Members of the German Legation state that the military attache4 P) Not printed. was recalled to Germany because of complaints made by the Imperial Government of his photographic activities. As a matter of fact, however, the telegram ordering him to Berlin was received some time before the Iranian complaint was even prepared. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 (current), paragraph 4 (iv). It is said Dr. Smend is accused of embezzlement of the German Legation lunds for 36,000 reichsmarks. Dr. Grobba is reported to have been a high-ranking freemason. (iii) Germans arriving from the Reich are astonished that no one here speaks of United States intervention in the war. They state that in Germany the United States is considered as already at war with them on the side of the Allies. (iv) M. Waheb Zadeh, a senior partner of the important Iranian commercial house of that name in Hamburg, has recently returned to Tehran. A brief report of conditions in Hamburg is given as Appendix “ A ’(’) to this summary. (8) Italian Interests. Signor Alfonso Balocca, a prominent Italian contractor, has recently died in Tehran. M. Balocca was responsible for the construction of several silos, as well as part of the Trans-Iranian Railway. (9) Iraqi Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 17 (current), paragraph 9. Colonel Hamid, the Iraqi representative on the joint frontier commission, returned to Bagdad on the 27th September. The Imperial Government have agreed in writing that in cases of dispute about the frontier alignment which cannot be settled by the frontier commission themselves, appeal shall be made to a neutral arbitrator, who will be most probably a Turk. (10) United States Interests. Negotiations for the purchase of 128,000 tons of steel rails are still being carried on. (n) Census. A recent census carried out at Tabriz and environs up to a radius of 6 kilom. on the 27th September has resulted as follows : — Total population 213,542, of which 109,629 are male and 103,913 female. (12) Seismic Disturbance. At 23-10 hours on the 25th September a more than usually severe earth tremor was felt in the Tehran region. (13) Press. (i) On the 21st September the Iran and Ittilaat published articles expressing the profound sympathy of Iran with Egypt in the present situation. On this occasion, however, no accusations were made against His Majesty’s Government. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 19 (current), paragraph 12. No more has been written in the Iranian press on the subject of articles on Iran in the Swedish or American press, but the journalists of Tehran have not been slow to discover further cause of complaint in the newspapers of other foreign countries. On the 25th September a further article appeared in the Ittilaat. This time it was the turn of Switzerland, whose journalists were accused in forcible terms of being in the pay of belligerent Powers and of having published attacks on Iran and other neutral countries. The Swiss representative has on enquiry been referred to two articles published in the Neue Zuricher Zeitung, and he learns from his Government that one contained a friendly account by a Swiss correspondent of his recent journey in North Iran, while the other was a translation of an article on Field-Marshal Ironside by Mr. Harold Nicolson published in the July number of Foreign Affairs, from which a passing and unflattering reference to the present Shah had been omitted.On the 2nd October the Italian newspapers Popolo di Roma and Lazione Coloniale were attacked because of their repetition of the story of an intended Allied attack on the Caucasus. (14) Commerce. (i) There are 60,000 tons of mixed merchandise, including military stores, awaiting shipment in Trieste for Iran. An agreement was concluded with Lloyd Triestino for re-routing all of these goods via the Danube. As Iran has no clearing agreement with Italy, payment was to be made through the Germano- Italian Clearing Agreement, the former receiving the corresponding amount in Iranian currency through the Germano-Iranian Agreement. So far, the Imperial Government have not paid over the sum required, and the goods remain in Trieste. (ii) German commercial houses in Iran have received orders to continue to show interest in the various tenders advertised in the press so as to give the impression that the Reich can always deliver goods. Actual orders will be put off in every possible way. (iii) Exports for the past nine months from Iran to Germany total about 53,000 tons; there are still 15,000 tons awaiting transport. Imports. —Forty-five thousand tons have arrived at Bandar Pahlevi, of which 19,000 tons were paper and 1,500 tons medical goods. An agreement with Russia for the transit of German goods to Iran is said to have been signed and is a monopoly for the firm of Schenker, represented in Iran by Nouvel Express. Each month Germany can send 10,000 tons, as follows : 4,000 tons via Batum. 4,000 tons via Leningrad. 2 000 tons via Bigossovo (Lithuania). All merchandise for Iran must be declared to a central bureau in Berlin, which fixes the date shipment and the route. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache. Tehran, October 5, 1940.A? H B W . j 6/7o ; 1 1940 j Su'n'iery of e eonver»«tlon between MIbb A.K. Lambton ! (reee Attached and Sarhang ( olonel) Hayyirl, romanndant of the eeondrx^y llttrry School at Kerman shah, during e ^^cumey to Fernanahah, The natter repreeentB, no dcubt, the ^erecnrl opinion of the epeaker, but in view of the rarity of any contact between a British eubject and en Iranian *r?ny officer hie viewe are net without intereBt. olonel Hayyiri, whe is an r nfantry Officer, fought in the camnaigna in TTorthem ereia and subsequently se rved on the Russo-Tranian frontier commlaalon cf 1926. He is a man of sound ^ common sense and reasonable outlook, though not cf brilliant intelligence. ' J e is relatively well-infermed (for a erslan; and appeared to ettempt tc ^udge matters from an impartial point of view —- a rare quality among Persians. 1. In Colonel Hnyyiri** view, the future welfare of Tran demanded a British victory in the present struggle. He had nc wish that either Britain, Germany, or Russia should attain to overwhelnin* predominance In ; urope on account cf the possible repercueaiona such a develcpmtnt might hi ve in the policy of such a dominant power in the last. Ht saw the interest of Iren tc be in trie continuance in . uropt of great and small powers balancing one another, with Great Britain holding, on the whole, the dominant poetlion. Great Britain, he considered, would not wish to interfere in Tran or to see any other country do ec. l ie personal gymoathies also were with liberalism rather than tctali tarianism. 2. He considered British policy in recent years had been dieaetr/us. vhile giving full credit to Chamberlain far l sincerity at uni oh, he th the tumiell P$li y was e mistake and that a stand, and if necessary war, should have been made at the time of the ( zechoelovak crisis. At present, in his view. Great Britain had arrived at a dead end. An opportunity to make peace, he thought, was missed at the time of the defeat of Belgium when it could, so he thought, have been made without complete loss cf prestige. How there was nothing for it but to continue the war to the bitter end, and the devastation likely tc be caueed would be such that it would tend to make an \iltimate victory barren and useleee. S. Hie attitude to the Shah was mixed. He condemned much that is going on at the present day but attributed it rather to the material the Shah had to deal with than to the Shah, for whom he had a genuine admiration ©e an outstanding figure. He said the progress of the country was the work of one men rlone, and suggested that hictory was merely repeating itself, 1.e., that ©cvemt-nts in Tran always tended tc be the work ol some outstanding loader and net to spring from the neoplt, whom, on the contrary, that leader had to drag along with him. 4. He admitted and deplored the moral degeneration cf the people, which he attributed to the effects of Csjar rule rather than to Pah lev! rule. His severe condemnation of the Cejari; mey have been due to personal reasons, but it is not without interest in view of the recent tendency which can be observed, even if only faintly, tc compare the ahlavi regi e unfavourably with the Cajer. corruption, however, he said was worst than it hed been twenty years rgo, and wgb still increasing. Gfliciele, i e said, /wereforced to t«ke money; they and their %iveB had to keep up certain outward standard and their pay wee quite insufficient ;r thie. There had btcn no increase in wages commensurate with the ^reat increase in the cost of living. ^ 5. As regards the army, he said, conditions were far from what^'^ey should he, The materiel welfare of the men was neglected, yet they were expected to perform heavy duties. If put to the test he did not think they would fight. Tn the younger offiere he had no confidence and he feared that they would readily sell their country. He reiterated his distrust Of the younger officers. 6. The dominating feeling in Tran at the present time, he said, was hatred of the British, arising as the direct result of Iranian discontent with the present regime. This hatred led naturally to a desire for a German victory, which was fervently honed for by many. Tt was not uncommon, he taid, for oeople to make a vow dependent upon a German victory. (This is no doubt on the part of those who make the vow rather a manner of speaking but it is nevertheless an indication of the prevailing fteling.) The responsibility of the British for the real and supposed ills of the people under the present regime is so widely accented he said that any unfortunate occurrence is at once said to be the fault of the British (this again is a manner of sneaking but also an indication). He said that the discontent of the people i ad become so great that they were prepared to suffer personal loss in order to heve the satisfaction of seeing harm come to those who were, in their view, responsible for their present condition, i.e. the British. Their present attitude was, he said typified by the ersinn expression, All, drown bin, even if we are drowned on the top of him. 1 )INDEXED Fi I F rnp y^^- ^' THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF llIS BRITA1 NIC MjiK^EBTY S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 21 for the Period, ending October 19, 1940. (1) The Shah and the Imperial Family. H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence at the Imperial Palaces in Tehran. On the 11th October T.I.H. the Crown Prince and Princess attended the Third Autumn Race Meeting at Jalalieh Race-Course. The Shah has acquired for a nominal sum a large area of private house property in Tajrish (suburb of Tehran), where he intends constructing modern villas. (^) Iranian Officials. (i) M. Nayereddine Pirzadeh has been appointed Director-General of the Ministry of the Interior. (ii) M. Hassan Farzaneh (Foreign Office Personalities, No. 80), ex-Governor of Bushire, has been appointed Ustandar (Governor) of Mazanderan. (3) Iranian Air Force. (i) On the 9th October a Hawker “ Hind aircraft crashed in front of H.I.M. the Shah at the Qila Murgha aerodrome. Both occupants (Captains Mashayekhi and Jehan) were killed. (ii) The two hangars under construction by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have now been completed. A third has also been erected, this making four in all. (4) British Interests. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 20 (current), paragraph 6 (i). Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Imperial Government for the immediate conversion of £1 million into gold has been reached. The Imperial Government, while denying that delay had been due to inaction on their part, have expressed their gratitude that their requirements in this matter have been met. Although the agreement was only reached after the expiry of the Imperial Government’s ultimatum, nothing further was heard of upsetting the recently concluded agreement with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. . . (ii) Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. UndeiSvood, British Military Attache, visited Bagdad (Iraq) on liaison duty from the 8th to 16th October. (5) German Interests. (i) Herr Ettel, the German Minister, visited Tabriz from the 12th to 16th September He addressed the local German community on two occasions, first in the Azerbaijan Club, which had been hired for the occasion, and later at [ 12 — 31 ] I ££Cb. pcl r:p r . i 16 DEC 7940 'INDIA Orancl2 Sherif Khaneh in the home of the German manager of the transport services on Lake Rezaieh. On the former occasion a him was shown, and the Minister spoke oi the value of the cinema for propaganda purposes. Iranian police officials were present. At Sherif Khaneh no Iranians were present, and the Minister harangued his audience on the subject of the war and mentioned how each one of them was to carry out the job allotted to him. It is said that one of the reasons for the German Minister's visit to Tabriz was to enquire whether the results obtained by German propaganda in Azerbaijan were commensurate with the (considerable) sums expended. Turkish sources report that the German organisation works smoothly and that key men in the Administration, military and civil, are under German influence. (ii) Recently the German Legation has refused re-entry visas to German subjects. The explanation given is that the German Government cannot allow entry to anyone who could contradict the lies put out by the Propaganda Bureau about conditions in England and the German successes. (iii) Germans and other foreigners employed in the provinces are being given entirely false news items. A Sudeten German railway constructional engineer, returning to Tehran from Shahrud, was astounded to hear that Gibraltar had not yet been taken, that Spain was not yet in the war, and the Suez Canal was not yet in the hands of the Italians—all of which he had heard from Germans coming from Tehran. (iv) The German Minister (Herr Ettel) has sent over 1,000 parcels to the 1 soldiers of the occupying armies. At the last moment he decided to have enclosed in each parcel a friendly letter of encouragement and congratulation from one of the German colony. The aim of the letter is to establish personal contact for sending further parcels, and the exchange of propaganda. (v) “ Party ” activity is being manifested in new forms and is being intensified. Courses in foreign languages (French, English, Iranian) have been arranged, as also have courses in fencing, riding, driving and gymnastics. (vi) It is noted that the Deutsche Allemagne Zeitung has begun the “ Germanisation ” of the names of towns occupied; for instance, Nancy is Nantizig; Verdun, Verden; Cambrai, Kambryx. (vii) German Legation circles are fully confident of ultimate victory. They maintain that the invasion of Britain is not now necessary, as the constant and heavy aerial bombing of London and the cities of the Midlands is beginning to have effect and will cause the British people to collapse. To hasten the end, they / state that the Fiihrer is determined to use a secret and powerful gas to accomplish his ends. (6) Soviet Interests. (i) Eight White Russians, who had become Iranian nationals, have recently been much persecuted by the Iranian police and ordered to leave the country. They managed to prolong their stay several times by bribing certain senior police officials. In the end, they got so exasperated that they went in a body to the Soviet Consulate and told the consul their story, asking him to do what he liked with them, even to returning them to the U.S.S.R. The consul was very sympathetic and issued them with Soviet passports within twenty-four hours, telling them to go to the Iranian police once more to demand permission to stay If the police did not issue them with these documents, they were to throw “ these worthless bits of paper ” (Iranian passports) in their faces. The band of White Russians accordingly again visited police headquarters and asked for permission to stay on in Iran. This was immediately refused. They then threw down their Iranian pasports and drew from their pockets the Soviet documents. “ Permis de Sejour ” was immediately granted. (ii) About the middle of September two members of the Soviet Embassy in Tehran inspected the former Russian Consulate buildings in Isfahan and Bushire. (7) United States Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 20. paragraph 10. A contract has been signed between the United States of America and Iran for the supply of 130 000 tons of rails. The American terms were more favourable than those offered by India.3 (8) Bread Situation. The bread situation has recently been serious in Tabriz. Flour was rationed and there was a shortage of bread, which was of poor quality. Bread queues were the general rule and the people were in an angry mood; in fact, so much so that the Chief of Police is said to have informed the Ustandar (Governor) that ~Te could no longer be responsible for law and order unless sufficient Hour was released. At the beginning of the month the Ustandar and the head of the municipality were summoned to Tehran. The day after their departure the bread supplies were sufficient (though flour was still rationed) and the quality good. The Ustandar, Mustawfi, has been dismissed and his successor, M. Ardalan, reached Tabriz on the 8th October. Whereas the bread shortage in Tabriz in the spring of the year was caused by Azerbaijan being denuded of flour for the benefit of Tehran and elsewhere, it seems that the recent shortage was due to local Iranian officials’ cornering of supplies. (9) Trade. Iranian cotton in considerable quantities is being transported from the interior of Iran to Bazargan (degree sheet 1.A.C.3) for transport via Trebizond to Germany or Italy. Large quantities have been held up in Bazargan for some months, and it is now hoped to move these. There is, however, a shortage of transport on the Turkish side, and a reluctance on the part of the Germans to send the cotton by the alternative route via Russia, who demand the fumigation of the cotton before transportation. German dye-stufls, paper-ware and medicines have reached Iran via Julfa. Russian woollen piece-goods in small quantities have come into Iran via Julfa. H. J.

It appears that a demonstration of bombing, machine-gunning and aerial combat was being carried out near Qila Murgha aerodrome in the presence of H.I.M. the Shah, H.I.H the Crown Prince and senior officers of the army and air force. Fury machines attacked a flight of Hind aircraft, of which the machine piloted by Captain Jehan was to go into a spin as if shot down. All went according to plan, but Captain Jehan failed to pull his machine out of the spin and crashed from about 2,000 feet, bursting into flames. The occupants were instantaneously killed. No ambulance or fire engine was ready for duty. The rest of the programme was carried out as arranged. H.I.M. the Shah has sent the families of the deceased officers the sum of 14,000 rials each from the Privy Purse and ordered special pensions. (ii) On the 20th October at Doshan Tappeh aerodrome a second Air Speed Oxford machine crashed whilst taking off. The machine can, however, be again made serviceable by borrowing parts from the machine which crashed on the 23rd September.

As a result of his report to the Shah, Sartip (Brigadier) Khosrovani, commanding the Imperial Iranian Air Force, was imprisoned for ten days for making false reports as to the damage done to’ these aircraft.

(ii) Certain members of the French Legation, headed by the consul, M. Bleuzet, have been making secret enquiries about the attitude of private individuals of the French colony. They have stated that this is being done in accordance with orders received from Vichy, and that, if any members of the colony are found lacking in sympathy for the present Government, they will be reported to Vichy, where adequate steps will be taken against their families and property. 8. Belgian Interests. M. Harry Graeffe, son of his Excellency the Belgian Minister at Tehran, has been accepted as a candidate for a commission in the Indian army for the duration of the war. M. Graeffe left for India via Zahidan and Quetta on the 21st October. 9. Japanese Interests. Lieutenant-Colonel Tomo Takasina, Japanese Military Attache, has been relieved by Lieutenant-Colonel K.

Iranian State Railways. Tehran-Meshed Branch .—This branch line is now open to traffic as far as Damghan (M.S.15.C.4).4 (!) Not printed 14. Bahrein Islands. (i) The persistence of the Imperial Government in the claim to Bahrein took form in an objection to the procedure adopted by the Bahrein postal authorities regarding mails for Persian Gulf ports and, eventually, to a refusal to^accept such mails. In order to allay this “ storm in a tea-cup, the Government of Indi ^ have accepted a suggestion made by the Imperial Government that a return should be made to the procedure in force before May 1939. (ii) At 03-45 a.m. on the morning of the 19th October the oil refinery at Bahrein was bombed by enemy machines of unidentified type from a height of about 3,000 feet. Some fifty bombs and parachute flares were dropped without causing damage or casualties. „ The official Italian communiques which had stated that the islands ot. Bahrein were a British possession were corrected on this point in the Iranian press by a footnote pointing out that the islands of Bahrein were now illegally in the possession of others, but the Imperial Government considered them as part of Iran and reserved all the rights of possession. On the 28th October the Iranian official press published an article entitled : “ Astounding Fiction.” This stated that the foreign press, commenting on the Italian bombing of Bahrein, had suggested that, as the Royal Navy used Iranian petrol it was possible that Abadan would also be attacked by the Italian air force. ’ The Iranian press points out that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are only concessionaires for the exploitation of the oil, but all the buildings, plant, &amp;c., belong to Iran. Any act of hostility would be resisted to the utmost by the armed forces of Iran. A similar statement was made from the Tehran broadcasting station. ^ , . . ....... t The Italian Minister was also given an official warning by the Minister tor Foreign Affairs. . . , i j u ^ Reinforcements of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns ha\e already been despatched to Khuzistan. 15.

On the 2nd November the Imperial party proceeded to Gumbad-i-Kjabus by the new Shahrud-Naudeh-Shahpasand road. The following day H.I.M. the Shah arrived at the Palace of Ali Abad, near Gurgan. Whilst in Gurgan (from the 4th-6th November) the Shah inspected the garrison in barracks and many of the newly constructed public buildings of Gurgan.

(i) The German engineer (Herr Willig), formerly of Junkers Air Mail Service in Iran and a resident for many years in Iran, is still engaged in recon ditioning the two old Junkers machines at Doshantappeh. They are shortly to be given test flights.

Gas Oil. —90,000 litres a month (1,050 l. = l ton). Grease. —Small quantities. ^ It is significant that in the four months July to October of this year 4, 5, 6 and 7 million litres of fuel oil have been supplied in that order. It is thought that this increase may be seasonal, but on the other hand it may not. Fifty metric tons of lubricating oil have recently been asked for. 6. British Interests. Syed Alif Shah, a British Indian subject and a resident in Tehran for the past fifteen years, was summoned to the Passport Section of the Imperial Police Department on the 4th November and ordered to leave the country within ten days, otherwise he would be arrested and compulsorily expelled. No reason was given for this action, but it is considered most likely'that Sahib Singh, the rich Sikh merchant of Tehran, who is not on good terms with Syed Alif Shah is the root cause of this expulsion order. At the beginning of the war Syed Alif Shah had loyally offered his services m any capacity to His Majesty’s'Legation and had been given casual employment as a translator. He also came regularly to the legation to collect English newspapers, &amp;c., as material by which to counteract any anti-British propaganda with which he might meet. It is believed that the police whose close watch on the legation is singularly unfruitful, made enquiries about byed AM Shah m the Indian community and easily found Sikhs to sav that q Spy - The le ' ation have secured five da 7 s ’ grace, during which byed AM bhah is to present a petition to the Ministry of the Interior. 7. French Interests. Vir&gt;hI he h FrenC K Consulate BI euzet), presumably acting on instructions from haVG ,^ n warnm g tj 16 French colony against listening-in to the tendancieux British news broadcast in French. On the other hand, the military attache, who was completely Vichy-minded for the first two or three months after the armistice, seems to be becoming much better disposed toward the Bi itish and openly hopeful of a British victory. 8. Soviet Interests. Berli^ Extreme uneasiness prevails throughout Iran over Molotov’s visit to Sovi e ( tTur“n med reP ° rtS S ° Vlet t, '° 0pS are ^ concentrated in 9. German Interests. (i) The German Minister (Herr Ettel), accompanied by some of his staff was present at the official taking-over ceremony of the dredger Mazanderan ’(vide 30th OcftoberHe,T ry i'tVl 22 .

Two recent arrivals are Austrian officers who are known to have been on active service in Poland and &gt;&amp;&amp;. sssataJLitt:—^ £= » G.™Z 0 oTC/rS «*' chiM ' l “™ ^ — M. (in) The Nazi party have intensified their activities among the colonv According to the winter programme, compulsory physical training classes are held in a special building in Tehran every Wednesday and Friday g Eauftation h,nd - -A. SK5;•A 5 Sc At the special fetes arranged in the Brown House, a collection is always taken up for the Winter Help Fund. This is in addition to the 10 per cent, of salary which all Germans are ordered to pay. Members of the Nazi party wear the party uniform when attending such functions. (iv) On the 6th November German business men were summoned to the legation and were given orders to deal no more in dollars and to endeavour to stop any movement of currency to the United States as the blocking of all German and occupied territories credits in the United States was anticipated. (v) The broadcast in German from London at 11-30 p.m. Tehran time (20-00 hours G.M.T.) on Saturday evenings is most popular with Germans of all classes who are not at heart members of the Nazi party. The imitation of a harangue by the Fiihrer is especially appreciated. (yi) As a result of recent deliveries, and of the expected arrival of the heavy machinery, &amp;c., for the Kerej Blast Furnaces, the German debt of 40 million reichsmarks to Iran is regarded as having been almost completely wiped out The freight, however, on the heavy machinery, is enormous, and it has vet to be proved whether the heavier pieces can be transported at all via Russia and the Caspian. (yii) Messrs. Siemens’ representative in Tehran has stated that no more electrical material can be sent to Iran by his firm, and it is believed that this is a result of the bombing of the Siemens Factories by the R.A.F. (viii) Sarlashgar Ahmed Muini has been joined in Germany by two more oflicers. It is reported that they are engaged in purchasing war material, more especially anti-aircraft artillery, aircraft and munitions. 10. United States Interests. The first instalment of the payment for the American schools recently transferred to the Iranian authorities was not made on the due date. The United States Charge d’Affaires pounced heavily on a hint that the cause of the delay was the refusal of the British Government to provide the Iranian Government with dollars. 11. Czech Interests. The community is not united. While some of the Czechs are in touch with His Majesty s Legation, some continue to apply to the Irench. Some were unwise enough to ask the French Legation to send their passports to Beirut for renewal, and a group of Czechs have asked the French Military Attache to remit to the Czech Provisional Government in England a sum of monev which they have collected. 12. Netherlands Interests. A Yugoslav steamer, the Timok, brought to Bandar Shahpur a caro-o of sugar from the Netherlands Last Indies which had been bound for the Mediterranean when Italy entered the war, and the sugar was sold to the Iranian Government. The Government wished to charter the ship to fetch from Assab some goods which had been on their way to Iran in an Italian steamer when Italy entered the war, but on making application to the brokers in London they found that she had been chartered by someone else. Annoyed at this, and alle°-in«' that the captain (who had no powers in the matter) had promised that the Tvmok would make the voyage to Assab, the Shah has ordered that the sugar shall not be paid for until the goods have been lifted from Assab. An American steamer chartered, it is believed, at a cost of over $180,000, is on her way to Assab and the Netherlands Legation are wondering what is to happen if the goods, about which there is no news, are found to have been destroyed or damaged in RAF raids. 13. Roumanian Interests. The Roumanian Legation at Tehran has been closed down. 14. Japanese Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 (current), paragraph 9. Lieutenant- Uolonel lomo Takasima left Tehran on the 10th November for Japan via Baedad and Colombo.6 15. Polish Interests. A note on certain wireless apparatus handed over by the Poles to the French Military Attache in Tehran in October 1939 is given as an appendix(') to this summary. 16. Danish Interests. A contract was signed in August 1939 between the Imperial Government and the Danish firm S.A. Altas Maskinfabrik (agent in Iran, M. Storch Nielsen) for the supply of machinery and installation of a meat and vegetable canning plant at Shahi (total value = 1 million kroner). The Imperial Government undertook to build the factory, which is now completed. The machinery has arrived and the factory is expected to be in production in January 1941. The maximum output aimed at is about 8 tons per diem. Several Danish experts have been engaged on contract for a period of three years. 17. Census. The result of the census of Meshed up to a radius of 6 kilom. carried out 83,995 } Total 176 ’ 471 42,284 18. Commerce. According to the Iranian press, large quantities of sugar, both granulated and lump, have been imported to ensure that there is no shortage of this commodity in Iran for the next two years. The figures given are as follows :— Tons. March 1938-March 1939 92,895 March 1939-September 1939 ... ... ... ... 54,564 September 1939-March 1940 ... ... ... ... 41,843 March 1940-September 1940 (cleared) ... ... 41,621 In customs storehouses September 22, 1940 ... ... 40,742 19. Coal Mining Develo'pment. The coal-producing areas nearest to Tehran lie about 35 kilometres due north in the valleys of the Elburz Mountains, roughly extending from Mount Damavend (16 A.A. 1) through the villages of Lar-Abnak (8 P.C. 4)- Zaigun (9 N.C. 1)-Lalun (9 M.C. 1)-Shimshak-Nisa (8 P.B. 4) to the Chalus Road. The German firm of Ferrostahl have, in spite of high tenders, been awarded the exclusive contract for the development of this area, which is of urgent necessity in view of the construction of the blast furnaces at Kerej, and the increased industrialisation of the Tehran area. A cable aerial railway is to be constructed linking the coal areas with Tehran. The main power station will be at Fasham. The three branches of the cable aerial railway will be as follows :— (1) Zaigun to Ear. (2) Zaigun to Fitchal-Shimshak. (3) Zaigun-Fasham-Tehran (village of Jawadieh) near the Tehran-Firuzkuh main road. Later on Shimshak will be linked with the Chalus Road via Nisa. Roads and bridges in the area are now being rapidly constructed in readiness for the arrival of vast quantities of electric and transporter plant. The cable railway is to be two-way and of the latest construction. 20. Lighthouses in the Persian Gulf. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 (current), paragraph 4. The inauguration ceremony of the lighthouse at the west end of the Bushire aerodrome on the 1st November is as follows :— Men Women Families ... ... (') Not printed.7 took place on the 26th October. The following are brief descriptions of the lights as given by the headquarters of the Iranian naval forces of the south :— Bus hire — Locution. Latitude 28° 56' 32-5' North. Longitude 50° 48' 45' East. Light .—Revolving with six-second flashes. Visibility .—16 miles. Qais Island — Location.—L&amp;titxxdiQ 26° 30' 50' North. Longitude 53° 58' 48' East. Revolving with five-second flashes. Visibility .—16 miles. ote.— -Consular reports state that these lights are already giving trouble owiifg to overheating. (ii) According to the press, the naval forces of the south intend to erect permanent lights at the entrance to the bay of Khur Tiyab (M.S.25.A.L). 21. Shipping (Caspian Sea). Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (1939), paragraph 18. On the 28th October the dredger Mazanderan was commissioned for service at Bandar Pahlevi. Amended details are given of this vessel :— Length : 74 -60 metres. Beam: 12-40 metres. Height: 5-30 metres. Draught: 4-25 metres. Dredging capacity : 1,000 metres per hour. Maximum dredging depth : 10 metres. Speed : 13 kilom. per hour. Crew : Thirty-one. 22. Tribal. Unconfirmed reports of slight unrest in Luristan and Bakhtiari country have recently been noted. This may be due either to German propaganda among the tribes or to economic distress. The latter is considered a likely reason, as during the construction of the Trans-Iranian many Lur tribesmen were employed as labourers for as much as 8 rials per day, and so became accustomed to a higher standard of living. This, with the completion of the railway, has now ceased. 23. Press. The Swiss newspaper Neue Ziiricher Zeitung is now in trouble for its publication of an article about the possible invasion of Iran should the war extend to Asia Minor. The official Iranian press points out that such hypotheses are ridiculous. Even were the war to include Asia Minor, Iran would certainly not be affected. In any case, if any Power wished to attack Iran, did the Swiss newspaper imagine that the aggressor would not be opposed by the entire might of Iran’s military forces ? The publication of this offensive article against Iran is being dealt with through diplomatic channels. 24. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The employees of the A.I.O.C. have contributed over £10,000 to His Majesty’s Government for aircraft construction. This sum has been gratefully acknowledged by the Prime Minister. For political reasons no public acknowledgment was considered advisable. Employees of the Imperial Bank of Iran are collecting funds among themselves for a “ Spitfire ” fund. H. J.

This officer is reported t° .have recently served in Mongolia and Manchukuo. He is extremely anti- |British. On the voyage from Japan to Iran per steamship Chile Maru, Colonel murasawa took great interest in all allied shipping seen, especially the Queen Mary at Singapore. He was continually sending messages to Japan by wireless. He openly stated that Japan would shortly occupy Indo-China and the Dutch hast Indies and that an agreement with the Soviet over the China question was about to be concluded. With regard to Iran he has instructions to negotiate the sale of Japanese military aircraft up to 5 million yen. and, if successful, to endeavour to obtain the r ight to start an aircraft factory in the Shiraz area. 10.

Tehran, December 14. 1940. ' Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 25 for the Period ending December 14. 1940. ^6 #3 1. The Shah and the Imperial Family. (i) H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence at the Imperial Palaces in Tehran. (ii) On the 7th December H.I.M. the Queen returned to Tehran after three weeks’ holiday in Mazanderan. Her Imperial Majesty was attended by Mme. Qavam, wife of his Excellency Ibrahim Qavam (Qavam-ul-Mulk) (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 231, Foreign Office No. 169). (iii) According to the press, H.I.H. the Crown Princess Fowzieh has personally ordered the formation of a Child Welfare Association. An influential committee has been formed, which includes the Ministers of the Interior, War, and the chief of police. It is feared that large “ voluntary ” subscriptions will shortly be called for, as in the case of the Aero Club. 2. Iranian Army. (i) On the 4th December an Imperial decree was published calling up in succession the following classes of reservists for one month’s training, commencing after the New Year of 1320 (the 21st March. 1941) : — Class 1295 (1917), first half of class. „ 1286 (1908). „ 1289 (1911). „ 1291 (1913). „ 1293 (1915). This reserve training is normal, but the warning order has been published two months before the usual time. The numbers affected will be about 20,000-25,000. (ii) Individual training continues throughout all units. (iii) A certain number of reservists of all classes who have been hitherto exempt are now undergoing training for three months or more. The numbers affected are negligible. 3. Iranian Air Force. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 (current), paragraph 5 (ii). The second Air Speed Oxford machine has been repaired and passed air-worthy. (ii) Owing to inclement weather, very little flying has taken place in the military aerodromes near Tehran.2 (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 (current), paragraph 5 (iv). On the 10th December the fifteenth “ Hind machine out of twenty erected at the Shahbaz Aircraft Factory at Doshantappeh successfully completed its test flight. . rrl (iv) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 (current), paragraph 5 (v). ne six newly completed “ Hind machines (Bristol engines) were apparently sent to Ahwaz to replace six “ Hind ” aircraft (Hornet engines) which have become unserviceable. The unserviceable machines are locked up in Ahwaz. (v) The Acting Minister of War (Sarlashgar Ahmed Nakhchevan) has been informed from London that material and engines for the construction of sixty Hurricane machines in Iran will be released early next year. (vi) Ten Curtiss Fighters have been purchased in the United States and will be delivered in the spring. . . (vii) The Iranian air force authorities have been making enquiries as to whether the British aircraft personnel could construct Curtiss aircraft at the same time as the Hurricane machines are being built. Apparently the Curtiss Aircraft Company refuse to send their engineers to Iran, on the ground that they are too busy. . . (viii) Sartip (Brigadier) Khosrovani, head of the Iranian air force, has recently been severely reprimanded by His Imperial Majesty. It is rumoured that he may be relieved of his present appointment. Sarhand (Colonel) Marjan, Air Officer'Commanding at Qila Murgha, may be appointed in his place. (ix) Sarhang (Colonel) Mohanna, Air Officer Commanding the Aircraft Factory, has been granted indefinite leave. (x) H.I.M. the Shah inspected the aircraft factory on the 26th November. On arrival the Shah was in a peevish mood, shouting and abusing nearly everyone. In the anxious clean-up before his arrival someone had unfortunately left a pile of dust in one of the workshops. A moment before the Shah arrived a compressed air pipe got adrift and sent all this dust into the atmosphere, which was full of it, and in bright light, just as His Imperial Majesty entered. The Shah nearly blew up. (xi) All Iranian aircraft are shortly to be camouflaged. (xii) Officers and other ranks of the Imperial Air Force have recently been shown a Luftwaffe propaganda film. Apparently this film has caused a deep impression of Germany’s air might. 4. British Interests. (i) The Ministry of Finance are now pretending that they would never have concluded the recent agreement with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company if they had not been satisfied that His Majesty’s Government would convert into gold £3 million in 1940 and £3 million in 1941 out of the revenue derived by the Imperial Government from oil. His Majesty’s Government are converting £li million in 1940, and have made a handsome concession in agreeing to convert £750,000 at the beginning of each quarter instead of million a month, but the Imperial Government demand another £1^ million this year, and have informed the Tehran representative of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, for the information of His Majesty’s Legation, that, if they do not get it, the relations between the company and the Imperial Government will suffer. It is not certain that the Imperial Government need to convert so much, unless they have in mind the conversion into gold of some or all of a loan of £1 million which they hope to get from the company. (ii) The Government of India have now decided to include in the list of articles liable to duty on importation into British India across the Irano-Indian frontier not only motor vehicles and accessories thereof, but rubber tyres and tubes also. ... Motor vehicles registered in Iran may apply for a British Customs Pass which is valid for visits to British territory for certain specified periods. 5. Belgian Interests. (i) The Belgian Legation in Tehran have done little or nothing to call up Belgian reservists for military service in England, in accordance with the instructions lately sent to them' by the Belgian Government in London.✓ ■ 3 (ii) M. Embrechts, chief representative of Standard Telephone Company in Iran, has been informed by the German authorities in Belgium that, because ot his absence, they are confiscating all property found in his private safe deposit in the Banque d’Anvers. M. Embrechts values this at over £6,000. Besides this, ‘the Belgian authorities have given him notice that, unless he pays property tax for 1939 and 1940, his property will be compulsorily sold. 6. German Interests. (i) The local press printed an important-looking telegram from Berlin announcing the signature of a commercial agreement about quotas between Germany and Iran at Berlin on Friday, the 6th December, by M. Hamid Sayyah, Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign x^ffairs, for Iran, and Herr Clodius for the Reich. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs state in confidence that this agreement, which is a matter of annual routine, could have been concluded between a secretary from the German Legation in Tehran and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but the German Government insisted that an Iranian official should visit Berlin for the purpose, and advertised the signature of the agreement as though it was something of great importance. (ii) There is some evidence of a scheme based on Tehran to try to restore diplomatic relations between Germany and Iraq and to injure British interests in Iraq in general. The intermediaries have not been chosen from among the large number of Germans already present in Iran, but have been sent out specially for the purpose. (iii) It is said that the clearing balance in favour of Iran which existed at the beginning of the war has been cleared off by means of items approximately as follows :— Marks. Material for Kerej blast furnaces 1,600,000 Freight, &amp;c., on this material ... ... ... 1,000,000 Miscellaneous orders ... ... ... ... 600,000 3,200,000 (iv) There are already fifty Germans at the Kerej blast furnaces, and it is calculated that by next spring there will be 500. (v) General Koestrin, the German Military Attache at Moscow, is expected to visit Tehran shortly. 7. Greek Interests. There are some 200 Greek foremen and labourers in Iran, mostly employed on the Iranian State Railways. Of the above, several have applied to His Majesty’s Legation for repatriation with a view to joining the Greek forces. The Turkish Embassy, who look after Greek interests in Iran, have as yet received no instructions. The Royal Greek Consulate at Bagdad have published a notice in the Bagdad Times calling up Greek subjects for registration in Iraq. 8. U.S.S.R. Interests. The Soviet trade representatives in Iran were very much annoyed when, on their recent buying tour in Iran, they found that the Germans had bought up all the available raw materials. There is no doubt the Russians will do all they can to obstruct the transit of these materials via Russia. 9. Internal Conditions. Bread shortage is acute in Isfahan and I abriz and public feeling is rising. It is openly stated that the country’s wheat is being exported to Germany. 10. Communications. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 17 (current), paragraph 14 (ii). The enquiry from the Imperial Government about the repair of the Indian section of the Quetta-Zahidan Railway elicited a rather discouraging reply from the Government of India, who remember too well what difficulties the Imperial Government used to create at Mirjawa, the only place where there is a sufficiency4 of water. The Imperial Government thereupon pretended that they had only raised the matter because they had heard that the Government of India were themselves proposing to embark upon the repair of their section of the line, and affected indifference. (ii) The Dasht area (M.S.22.A.3.) which has recently been acquired by the^^- Shah is undergoing intensive development. Next year it is proposed to import Hazaras in large numbers to populate the fertile lands around Dasht. It is also proposed to construct a motor road to connect Bujnurd with Gurgan via Dasht. (iii) Kazerun-Bebehan. There is no motor road between these two places. The Ministry of Communications has just asked for tenders for the survey of a motor road, together with estimates for bridges, embankments, &amp;c. 11. Census. (i) The result of the census of Ardebil, in East Azerbaijan, up to a radius of 6 idiom., carried out on the 8th December is as follows :— Men Women ... Families ... 12,738 (ii) Active preparations for the census of the following cities are under way : Isfahan. Hamadan, Resht, Bandar Pahlevi, Kermanshah, Yezd, Kerman and Shiraz. 12. Minerals. M. Weis, director of the Dutch Exploration Company, states that his geologists have found iron-ore deposits, 62 per cent., on Larak Island (south of Bandar Abbas) and also on Farur Island (south-west of Lingeh). 13. Finance. The Iranian Treasury is short of cash. Railways and road contractors are not being paid (Intelligence Summary No. 26 (current), paragraph 11, refers), and salaries of officials are also in arrears. This shortage is due chiefly to the fact that the Imperial Government has had to finance the clearing agreement with Russia. It is feared that the Imperial Government may increase the note circulation up to \\ million rials without increasing the cover, which is already depleted by the Shah’s removal, recently, of the Crown jewels which are supposed to remain at the Banque-i-Mellie as part cover for the note issue. 14. Climatic Conditions. Heavy snowfalls are reported from Arak (Sultanabad), Senneh (Kurdistan), and even on the mountains in the vicinity of Yezd. This is unusually early for Iran. H. J.

(No. 282. Secret.) HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit , herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the period ending the 28th December, 1940, compiled by the military attache to this legation. b 1 A- 3 Tehran, December 28, 1940. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the Period ending December 28, 1940. (Secret.) 1. The Shah and the Imperial Family. (i) H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence at the Imperial Palaces in Tehran. (ii) On the 23rd December Her Imperial Majesty the Queen, accompanied by the Crown Princess Fowzieh and the Princesses Pahlevi, visited the Tehran Municipal Dispensary. It is not usual for the Queen to take part in such functions. 2. Iranian Officials. H.I.M. the Shah has appointed M. Abulfazl Towliyatt, a member of the Majlis, as director of the Waqf of the Holy Shrine of Hazrat Fatima at Qum in succession to his father, deceased. 3. Iranian Army. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 22 (current), paragraph 3 (i). The new Artillery Regiment of 150-mm. (5 • 9-in.) guns is now stated to consist of— 3 batteries, long, of 2 guns per battery. 3 batteries, short, of 4 guns per battery. Various parts of the guns have not as yet been delivered. Both for the short and long 2,500 shells (explosive) are held in arsenal. (ii) A nominal roll of the Sipahbud (General) and the Sarlashgars (Major- Generals) of the Imperial Iranian army, not in order of seniority, are shown in an Appendix to this Summary. 4. Iranian Air Force. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 3 (xi). The scheme for camouflage is tops light and dark earth colour; undersides silver. (ii) Practice in night flying recommenced on the 15th December after a long period of neglect. On the 16th December, General Khosrovani, the A.O.C., and his staff proceeded to Doshantappeh aerodrome to witness the night flying. Captain Sipahpur, an airmail pilot, took off from the north end of the flare path in a Tiger Moth. At the south end of the aerodrome an ambulance was stationed. General Khosrovani, feeling the cold, ordered the ambulance to come to the north . Y end and sat therein until Captain Sipahpur prepared to land. The pilot, \ unfortunately, was unaware of the change of the ambulance’s position and, in ' &gt;*&gt; 9 * \ spite of there being a full moon, collided on landing. The machine is 40 per cent. ‘ damaged. The aircraft was not fitted with landing lights. No further night ~ * flying has since taken place, but landing lights are now being fixed to several machines. (iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 3 (iv). The unserviceable “ Hind ” (Hornet engines) aircraft are now being put in order as rapidlv as possible. [15-9]2 (iv) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 3 (y). Cancel this paragraph. No material for the construction of “ Hurricane air craft has been released by His Majesty’s Government. The Imperial Government and the Iranian Air Force authorities are, however, very anxious for the release of raw material and certain finished parts in order to keep the Doshantappeh Aircraft Factory going. “Hurricane” construction plans, &amp;c., have already been received. « (v) Spare parts and material for ‘ ‘ Hind ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ Audax '' aircraft have not as yet been released by His Majesty’s Government. This is causing concern, as these aircraft badly require overhaul, but the fault lies with the Iranian autho rities, w T ho mislaid for a considerable time the draft order prepared by the British manager for Messrs. Hawker in Tehran. (vi) The American Curtiss Company have informed the Imperial Govern ment that they cannot provide engineers to build their aircraft in Iran. The Minister for War is examining the possibility of getting Curtiss planes built by the British personnel in addition to their other duties. (vii) The Minister for War shows appreciation of the work of the British staff in the aircraft factory, and is renewing the contracts as they expire, at a higher salary. 5. British Interests. (i) Mr. Churchill’s speech made a good impression here, but rather because the Iranians hate and despise the Italians than because of its intrinsic merits. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 4 (i) His Majesty’s Government have informed the Iranian Minister in London that they cannot convert into gold yet another £1^ million in respect of the year 1940. His Majesty’s Government reckon the arrangement as counting from the 1st July, 1940, whereas the Imperial Government ask that it should take effect from the 1st January. 6. United States Interests. (i) On the 18th December his Excellency Mr. Louis Goethe Dreyfus, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America, presented his letters of credence to H.I.M. the Shah at the Gulistan Palace. (ii) Mr. C. van H. Engert left Tehran on the 19th December, having been United States Charge d’Affaires for three years. When he arrived (it was his third term of service in Iran) there was no Iranian diplomatic or consular repre sentation in the United States, the Shah having withdrawn them all out of pique at the arrest of his Minister in Washington for exceeding the speed limit. The position which Mr. Engert won for himself may be judged from the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked him to postpone his departure for several days so that he might take leave of the Shah in person. Mr. Engert has been transferred to Beirut as United States Consul-General. He has been an excellent colleague and will be widely missed. (iii) The Standard Oil representative, Mr. L. A. Anderson, returned to Iran and suggested that he should be allowed to prospect for oil without any obligation on either side. The Imperial Government rejected the offer on the ground that foreign complications might arise, and he has now left the country. 7. German Interests. (i) Dr. Siems, a former xNazi party leader in Tehran, died suddenly on the 14th December. (ii) His Excellency the German Minister, addressing all Blockwarts on the 13th December, ordered them not to discuss the Italian situation. But if the subject were forced on them to emphasise two points : (1) that Germany would never let her partner down; (2) that the successful British and Greek attacks really make no difference to the final result of the war. Later, another legation official, Herr Tumler, advised Germans to avoid Italians in case of incidents, and told them that, owing to the Italian defeats, the war would be prolonged at least two years. This news was received with consternation! 8. U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) ^ here are between 300 and 400 families of Soviet nationality now residing in the Province of Gilan. These Russians have arrived within the past year and are not refugees.I 3 (ii) All executive posts in the Irano-Soviet Caspian Sea Fisheries Combine have been taken over by Soviet citizens. (iii) An agent who claims and is believed to be acting for the Soviet Trade Delegation in Iran has proposed that Russia should import rubber, pepper, tin and coffee from the Netherlands East Indies through Iran, and should supply in return plywood and cotton piece-goods. It is of interest that the agent, who is of /'““^dgarian nationality, tried to arrange a few months ago for the export of Netherlands East Indies produce through Iran to Bulgaria. 9. National Child Welfare Association. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (current), paragraph 1 (iii). The Imperial Family have subscribed the sum of rials 90,000 (£500) to the Child Welfare Association under the patronage of H.I.H. the Crown Princess Fowzieh. Lists of donations from Cabinet Ministers and others are now daily featured in the press. 10. F 'inance Ministry. An immense Palais des Finances is to be erected in the centre of Tehran. The ground has already been cleared for this. This “ palace ” will cover 50,000 square metres, and will consist of 1,200 offices, with lifts, central heating, electric lighting and modern conveniences complete. Its construction will cost 1 million rials. It is interesting to note that the Iranian building firm awarded the contract has four Cabinet Ministers and ex-Ministers on the board. 11. Tribal. On the 11th December a number of Bakhtiaris, including at least nine or ten notables, were arrested in Isfahan. The reasons for this action are not yet known, but rumours of German intrigues among the Bakhtiaris have been current for several months past. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieut.-Colonel, Military Attache.

January, 1941, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, January 10, 1941. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 1 for the Period ending January 11. 1941 (Secret.) dJ* 5 1. The Shah and the Imperial Family. (i) H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence at the Imperial Palaces in Tehran. (ii) On the 7th January Her Imperial Highness the Crown Princess Fowzieh, accompanied by their Imperial Highnesses the Princesses Shams and Ashraf Pahlevi, attended an evening reception at the Tehran Ladies’ Club in celebration of the sixth anniversary of the emancipation of Iranian women. Congratulatory telegrams were sent to H.LM. the Shah and the Queen. The anniversary was observed as usual throughout the provinces. 2. Iranian Officials. (i) Abul Qasin Najm (Najm-ul-Mulk) (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 192; Foreign Office, No. 144) has been appointed Minister at Tokyo to fill an existing vacancy. (ii) Hamid Sayah (Military Attache’s Personalities, No. 258; Foreign Office, No. 188), leader of the special Iranian Mission to Moscow and Berlin, returned to Tehran on the 3rd January. 3. Iranian Army. (i) A new cavalry regiment is being formed at Gumbad-i-Kabus in the Xth (Gurgan) divisional area. (ii) The battalion of the 5th (Rezapour) Infantry Regiment recently despatched to Khuzistan (vide Intelligence Summary No. 23, 1940, para graph 3 (v)) has since returned to Tehran. (iii) No special activity is taking place in the Iranian army. The training of conscripts is following its normal course. The new provincial divisions are being slowly equipped with artillery to complete up to at least one regiment of artillery per division. The following guns are reported to have been issued :— 14th (Kerman) Division : Two batteries 75-mm. (Bofors) mountain. One battery 105-mm. short. 13th (Isfahan) Division : One battery 75-mm. (Bofors) mountain. One battery 105-mm. short. 15th (Ardebil) Division: One battery 75-mm. (Bofors) mountain. One battery 105-mm. short. [15—10] B2 11th (Gilan) Division : One battery 105-mm. short, 10th (Gurgan) Division : One battery 105-mm. short. 4th (North-West) Division : Three batteries 105-mm. short. 3rd (North-East) Division : Three batteries 105-mm. short. Note. —Each battery consists of four guns. ^ The new divisions are still very much under strength. 4. Iranian A ij‘ Force. (i) The Tabriz military aerodrome is being enlarged and will extend to the left side of the Tabriz-Julfa road, which is to be diverted to the south-west. (ii) The construction of a landing ground at Sauj Bulagh (Mahabad) is being carried out. (iii) Two hundred and forty Browning pattern machine guns for aircraft have recently been delivered in Tehran. These form part of an order given to the Fabrique nationale beige which was completed just as the Germans seized Belgium. At the request of the Iranian Government, the Reich Government specially released these arms, which were despatched via Russia. (iv) Two new air regiments are to be formed after the anticipated delivery of aircraft from the United States, &amp;c. (v) There are rumours that negotiations are being carried on with the German Government for the supply of captured Polish aircraft. 5. Iranian State Railways. (i) Tehran^!abriz-Turkish Frontier. —Work is proceeding at hard pressure on Lots 11, 12, 13 and 14 (Zinjan-Mianeh-Miandoab sections). Tunnel No. 13 in Lot 11, 550 metres long, and Tunnel No. 7 in Lot 12, 600 metres long (just after Mianeh station), have been completed as well as a number of smaller tunnels. Two tunnels in Lot 14, 1,550 metres and 1.700 metres in length respectively, will be completed shortly. (ii) Qum-Yezd-Kerman^Zahidan. —H.I.M. the Shah is definitely interested in the linking-up of the Iranian State railways with the Indian railway network. In November M. Hacklin, a Swedish railway constructional engineer of the Ministry of Communications, accompanied by assistant engineers, visited Zahidan and Mirjawa. A survey of the Kerman-Zahidan portion is to be carried out shortly. It is said that the Shah has spoken about a branch line from Chahbar-Sardaz-Iranshahr-Bandar Regan, linking with the main Kirman- Zahidan line at Bam. 6. British Interests. (i) Acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government, whose informa tion is undeniably genuine, His Majesty’s Minister informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and later the Prime Minister, that the Italians are seriously considering an air attack on Abadan, and perhaps on the oil-fields also. The Imperial Government gave orders for their air raid precautions in the oil area to be tightened up, but preferred not to speak to the Italian and German repre sentatives on the subject at present, alleging that such a move might arouse a question that is dormant, and that the warnings they issued on this point, both in the press and to the Axis representatives in Tehran, just after the bombing of Bahrein, had made their position sufficiently clear. (ii) The attention of the Imperial Government has been once more drawn by His Majesty’s Minister to the existence of unnecessarily large numbers of Germans in Iran, some of whom are believed to be officers and to have no real connexion with the firms by which they are nominally employed. The Iranian authorities, however, are complacent, and declare that the measures which they have taken to keep all Germans under surveillance, to send away some who aroused suspicion, and to limit closely those allowed to enter the country, are sufficient to prevent any untoward incident. Unfortunately, there is much machinery of German origin to be installed, and for that the suppliers are allowed to send in the engineers and workmen; and as much of this belongs to the Shah and all forms part of his scheme of rapid economic development, and as, moreover, we are obliged, as a rule, to confine ourselves to generalities in our representa tions, there is little hope of persuading the Imperial Government to do more than they are doing already to prevent illegal activities on the part of the Germans.(iii) During the latter half of December a contract for the delivery of 30,000 tons of wheat was signed by the Government of India with the Imperial Government. 7,400 tons have already been delivered at Bandar Shahpur. This will do much to relieve the present bread shortage throughout the country. (iv) Following the discussions which have lasted seven years, (!), H.I.M. the Shah has now agreed to sell 500 tons of boxwood to Messrs. Gardner and Sons (Limited) of Liverpool at £31 per ton f.o.b. (v) The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have made a good beginning by purchasing 60 tons of silk cocoons which the Germans much wanted to secure. They are making enquiries about a number of other products. 7. French Interests. The French Legation at Kabul have been making enquiries in Feh ran about engaging a W/T operator. They have approached one A. Bethlehem, a pensioner of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 8. German Interests. (i) Officials of the German Legation have recently been busying themselves repairing the gravestones and graves of Germans buried in Iran. The remains of a former Prussian Minister Resident in Iran, Freiherr von Minutoli (born 1805, died 1860), were exhumed in Shiraz and reburied in Tehran Protestant Cemetery at Akbarabad on the 23rd December, 1940, in the presence of the German Minister. (ii) There is evidence that the Germans are taking an increasing interest m the Semnan-Meshed-Gurgan-Turkestan area. (iii) General-Lieutenant Koestring, military attache at Moscow, arrived in Tehran during the latter part of December. He visited Isfahan and left Tehran for Moscow on the 7th January. (iv) At a New Year reception at the “ Brown House.' the German Minister ordered his compatriots to avoid contact with Italians. This may be possibly in order to maintain German influence here and show that they are not co-operating with the Italians in their rash schemes. 9. Italian Interests. (i) It is reported that a quantity of large cases have recently been transported from Bandar Pahlevi to Bandar Shahpur for the Italian steamers interned in that port (steamship Bronter, a tanker, steamship Barbara, steamship Caboto). Coal and paint have also been sent to Bandar Shahpur. (ii) His Majesty’s Government have authorised the Panamanian steamship Eureka to proceed to Assab (Eritrea) via Aden to collect the Iranian cargo from steamship A rabia (Lloyd Triestino), which had taken refuge there at the declara tion of war by Italy. The Iranian Government have sent a minor official (M. Amir Arsalan Kamyab), of the Ministry of Finance, to take delivery on behalf of the Iranian Government and to check the cargo, as confidential infor mation has been received that some of this has been damaged by British air raids on the port, and also that the Italians themselves have requisitioned all the sugar therein. The Shah is personally interested in the cargo at Assab, as it is said to contain expensive war material, as well as goods belonging to himself and H.I.H. the Crown Prince. The Iranian Government are paying over £40,000 to charter the Eureka. (iii) Propaganda literature, Giornale d’Oriente, published in Cairo, and the pamphlet A/ii Servo Italia, have recently been successfully distributed among Italians throughout Iran. Some was introduced into the Casa d’ltalia in Tehran, where an acrimonious discussion of the contents took place before the Fascist officials were able to seize the papers. 10. U.S.S.R. Interests. Work on the Baku-Julfa Railway along the left bank of the Aras River is proceeding slowly. The point reached is about 33 miles north-east of Ordubad near Mejevan (M.S. l.C.l), where much tunnelling and bridging work is required. Ballast is being placed on the Julfa-Ordubad section, but the rails are still awaited. [15—10] b 24 11. Census. The result of the census of Isfahan up to a radius of 6 kilom., carried out on the 27th December, 1940, is as follows : — Men ... 104,505 Women 100,093 lry% Families 47,230 Total 204,598 12. Hospitals. The following hospitals have either construction in the provinces :— been completed or are in course of Beds. Zinjan 32 Kazerun 20 Isfahan 100 (Khiaban, Darvazeh, Tehran). 13. National Aero Club. Flying instruction continues regularly in Tehran, Meshed, Ahwaz and Tabriz. There are already ten Iranian ladies who have qualified as pilots. 14. National Child Welfare Association. On the 2nd January the press featured in thick type the fact that his Excellency the German Minister and Frau Ettel had donated 5,000 rials to this association. Other members of the Diplomatic Corps are subscribing, but less publicly. 15. Communications. (i) The bridge at Mianduab has been completed. It is built of reinforced concrete, has twenty-one arches, and is about 350 metres long. (ii) The road between Jokar and Tusar Khan (Degree Sheet 9 B.C. 3) has been completely reinforced and repaired. 16. Industry. The Ministry of Industry is now engaged in planning a factory for the manu facture of spare parts of all sorts, and motor accessories. It is to be constructed during 1941 at Dowlatabad, 7 kilom. from Tehran. The factory is to cover an area of 200,000 metres and will consist of seventeen principal buildings and twelve annexes. 17. A griculture. The Agricultural and Industrial Bank are financing the construction of a barrage and reservoir at Sadabad (Degree Sheet 10.0.A.3) on the Bud Shirin River. When completed, it is hoped that this water will be sufficient to irrigate 80,000 hectares of the now dry Shabankareh area. The cost is in the neighbour hood of 3 million rials. 18. The Press. An article recently appeared in the official Ittelaat admonishing foreigners on the subject of taking photographs in Iran. The press cannot understand why foreigners visiting Iran, and also those living in Iran, will insist on taking photographs of camels and peasants mounted on donkeys when there is so much that is modern to take in Iran. Travellers are therefore ordered to do justice to modern Iran and not take or exhibit such childish pictures as representing present-day life in Iran ! 19. Public Opinion. There has been a noticeable improvement in the situation as regards public opinion. This may be ascribed partly to the brilliant military successes in Libya, but also to the increased publicity which our cause is obtaining. The Persian broadcast by the B.B.C. is widely welcomed and praised on all sides. The onlyI 5 * criticism is that it is not daily. The illustrated magazine produced by Miniform, A 'ine-ye Jang, which has recently begun to reach this country, is excellent publicity and is doing much to correct the common belief that the Germans hold overwhelming preponderance in air and military strength. The fact that the B.B.C. Persian broadcast has had a much greater effect | the Delhi Persian broadcast is due principally to the psychological factor. Tne Persian was slighted when his Arab and Turkish neighbours were addressed nightly from London and he was only addressed from Delhi. He felt that the importance of Iran was not duly appreciated, that he was accorded the status merely of an oriental, and this was painful to his vanity. It must be admittted, however, also that the B.B.C. transmission is an improvement on the Delhi trans- ! mission. The reception of the transmission, the delivery of the announcer, and the language used are excellent. The Delhi broadcast has improved, but it cannot ; touch the London one as regards language and delivery. 20. Errata. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 26 (1940), paragraph 7 (ii).

OTT. h-e-ui. Tehran, January 24, 1941. Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 2 jor the period ending January 25, 1941. (Secret.) 1. The Shah and the Imperial Family. (i) H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence at the Imperial Palaces in Tehran. (ii) On the 17th January (Id-i-Ghadir) at the Gulistan Palace, His Imperial Majesty the Shah, attended by His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, received the congratulations of Cabinet Ministers, Government officials, general officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and police, and certain deputations. The Shah looked fit and well and spoke affably to the leading members of deputations. 2. Iranian Officials. M. Abdul Hussein Ansari (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 29, Foreign Office No. 22), Iranian Consul-General at Delhi, will be transferred to Stockholm shortly as Minister. 3. Iranian Army. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 20 (1940), paragraph 3 (ix). Sarlashgar (Major-General) Mumi, General Officer Commanding, West Azerbaijan Division, returned to Iran on the 12th January from Berlin. (ii) The Shah has ordered all reserve officers of the Imperial Army in the Tehran district to be present at the annual military review to be held on the 22nd February, 1941. Formerly the attendance of such officers was not considered compulsory. (iii) An increase in pay for all officers up to the rank of Sarhang (colonel) as from the New Year (21st March) is announced in army circles. Owing to the heavy increase in cost of living this concession is long overdue. 4. Iranian Air Force. (i) The twenty “ Hind ” aircraft assembled and partly constructed at the Doshantappeh aircraft factory have now all been delivered. This is undoubtedly a triumph for the British aircraft mechanics, eleven in number, who have had to work under extraordinarily difficult conditions. (ii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 25 (1940), paragraph 3 (ix). Sarhang (Colonel) Mohanna, Air Officer Commanding the aircraft factory, returned from leave on the 10th January.(iii) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 15 (1940), paragraph 6 (i). l^ight “ Rearwin,” United States training machines, have been delivered in cases at Doshantappeh. Seventeen others are on shipboard for Iran. 1 wo American pilot- mechanics are expected shortly to put these aircraft in working order. It is believed also that the “ Rearwin ’ manufacturers were approached by the Iranian authorities with a suggestion that their aircraft be built in Iran. They are not interested. i 5. British Interests. (i) On the 20th January Mr. Knight, chief representative of Messrs. Hawkers at the Doshantappeh aircraft factory, was informed in writing that the services of the British aircraft mechanics would lie no longer required if raw materials, &amp;c., were not forthcoming immediately for the construction of Hurricane aircraft. The notice is believed to have come direct from the Shah himself. The majority of the British aircraft mechanics do not wish to continue working in Iran and would prefer to be employed in the new aircraft factory in India or else return home. (ii) His Majesty’s Legation suggested to His Majesty’s Government that food parcels should be sent from here to British prisoners of war in Germany, to relieve the strain on food supplies and transport at home. This has been approved in principle. 6. U.S.S.R. Interests. Cases said to contain arms and munitions made in Russia or Germany have been passing through Iran in transit for another country, possibly China. They arrive at Bandar Shah and are taken by the Trans-Iranian railway to the south. 7. German Interests. (i) Further notes on the Nazi organisation in Iran are given in Appendix A( ) to this summary. (ii) Notes on suspected German agents in Iran are given as Appendix B(‘) to this Summary. (iii) The Germans have placed a large order, said to be worth 1 million rials, for cloth and blankets with the woollen mills at Isfahan. This order must, however, be sanctioned by the Imperial Government. (iv) General-Lieutenant Koestring, senior military attache at Moscow, arrived in Tehran about the 17th December. He lodged at a pension kept by a Fraulein Joch, employee of the German Legation. General Koestring visited Isfahan, which is reputed to be a centre of German activity. He is also known to have contacted with the Fifth Column leaders in Tehran. He intended visiting Afghanistan, but was dissuaded because of the lateness of the season. General Koestring left Tehran for Moscow on the 7th January. (v) The Nazi party is very busy organising everything and everybody, going so far into details as to nominate a “ Verbindungsfrau zum Film ' (female liaison officer for the pictures)! (vi) Trade relations between Iran and Germany have practically come to a standstill. The Minister of Commerce, who has the right to grant import licences for German goods, is refusing to do so. German commercial circles are, however, optimistic that the present difficulties will be settled shortly and trade between Iran and Germany will recommence on a large scale. The Sayah Commission is said to have arranged for barter sales and purchases with 40 million reichsmarks on each side. The Soviet, too, are again making difficulties over transit facilities for German goods from Iran. (vii) Recently the Iranian military authorities tried to purchase further arms and ammunition in Germany. It is said that they were refused, one of the reasons being that these arms might fall into the hands of the British. 8. Italian Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 9 (ii). The Italian military authorities have now cancelled the permission for the Panamanian steamship Eureka to proceed to Assab, Eritrea, to collect the Iranian C 1 ) Not printed.3 cargo from steamship Arabia (Lloyd Triestino Steam Navigation Company). This has caused a long protest against Italy to be published in the official press. There was, of course, no acknowledgment of concessions made by His Majesty’s Government. 9. Czechoslovak Interests. ^ Dissension in the Czech community has been ended by the formation of an unofficial committee of the three leading Czechs in Tehran, who are to assist His Majesty’s Legation on Czech questions, especially about political reliability, and professional qualifications. The committee consists of the following members :— M. Josef Zanda : Director Skodas (Iran). Dr. Josef Skvaril : Czech surgeon employed in one of the Government hospitals in Tehran. M. Josef Vrba : Formerly archivist of the Czech Legation in Tehran. The fact that Josef Vrba has been joined by the other two Czechs disposes of suspicions which had been unjustly directed against him. 10. Iraqi Interests. A consular report from Kermanshah states that on the 3rd and 5th January two affrays took place near Mehran, close to the Iraqi frontier, between Iraqi tribesmen and Iranian frontier guards. Both sides sustained casualties and took prisoners. The General Officer Commanding (Kermanshah) Division (Sartip (Brigadier) Assa), accompanied by the General Officer Commanding 5th (Senneh) Division (Sarlashgar Moqaddam) and Sarhangs (Colonels) Dombali, Military Governor of Shahabad area, and Tabatabai, Military Governor of Qasr-i-Shirin, left Kermanshah on the 12th January for Mehran (Pusht-i-Kuh) to investigate the matter. 11. Communications. Ab Ali-Amul Road. —Length, 139 kilom. According to the press, good I progress is reported on this route. Lot 1 (54 kilom.) has been completed, whilst Lots 2 and 3 will be open for traffic early in the Iranian New Year. The road will be 8 metres broad and will allow of the passage of heavy motor vehicles up to 20 tons. Sixteen large bridges have had to be constructed, six in Lot 1, nine in Lot 2 and one in Lot 3. The largest is over 45 metres long. Fourteen tunnels, of which one is 1,520 metres long, have been built. This route is the shortest between the central plateau and Mazanderan Province, and follows the ancient caravan route. Passing close by Mount Demavand (18.549 feet), the scenery is magnificent. 12. Air Raid Precautions. (i) A booklet entitled “ Dangers from the Air ” has been issued recently to Government officials and property owners. The matter is written in simple form with rather crude illustrations and contains advice on what not to do and what to do in an air raid. As no air-raid shelters have as yet been constructed, the advice given is not of much value. (ii) A.R.P. is being taken more seriously in the Abadan-Khurramshahr area, where a black-out is carried out nightly. This, however, is of little value as Basra is brightly illuminated and raiders could not miss the refinery during moonlight nights. (iii) M. Hamid Sayah, Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and his wife, who recently returned from four months of commercial negotiations in Moscow and Berlin, state (the latter in public) that, if only the Royal Air Force would bomb Berlin as hard as the Luftwaffe bomb London, the nerve of the German population would give way. This opinion has also been expressed in other Iranian circles as well. H. J. UNDERWOOD. Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

'/M)'/* ^ h- Enclosure. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 3 /or the Period ending February 8, 1941. *' * 1. The Shah and the Imperial Family. (i) H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence at the Imperial Palaces in Tehran. (ii) On Thursday, the 30th January, their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Princess and the Princess Ashraf Pahlevi attended incognito a masked ball at the Tehran Club. This is the first occasion on which any of the Imperial Family have visited this international club, the majority of whose members are British. No political significance is attached to this visit. 2. Iranian Army. (i) A supplement to this summary gives the names of brigadiers and other senior staff officers, with brief facts about their records of service. The majority of the names may also be found in “ Personalities in Iran.” (ii) A consular report from Tabriz states : Arrangements are being made to have a cavalry regiment stationed at Ahar (M.S.1.D.2), an infantry regiment at Marand (M.S.1.B.2) and a volunteer cavalry unit at Tabriz. (iii) The division in the course of formation at Khoi (M.S.1.A.2) will have no cavalry as the Russians are said to have objected to cavalry concentrations in the north-west. (iv) The General Officer Commanding 15th (Ardebil) Division is anxious to move his headquarters to Sarab (M.S.1.D.3), and to leave only one regiment at Ardebil (M.S.8.A.2), which he considers too close to the Soviet frontier. (v) On the 16th January a consignment (forty-four cases) of searchlights and sound-locator equipment, also twenty-six troop-carrying automobiles, has been received from the United States. (vi) An unknown quantity of 75-mm. (mountain) guns for Iran now lying at Trebizond are being sent to Samsun for onward despatch via rail to Khaniquin (Iraq). (vii) The Shah has ordered the Military Budget for the coming year to be increased by 1 milliard rials (£14,700,000 at the official rate) to meet the urgent needs of Iran’s defence. 3. British Interests. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 6 (iii). Some of the wheat purchased in India (30,000 tons) is reliably reported to be affected with the pest “ Calendra Oryza,” necessitating treatment with ethylene oxide before it can be issued to the bakers. This is unfortunate, and may be the cause of the rumours that the British deliberately supplied infected wheat. [16—13] b Ire z* fOL.r.rrTj 1 &gt;5 APR 941 INDIA OFFICE2 (ii) It has been established that some Iranian wheat is being exported to Russia from Caspian ports. This is not contrary to the assurance given to the Government of India by the Iranian Consul-General in India, that the Indian wheat which the Imperial Government wished to buy was required for internal consumption and would not be re-exported, but it is contrary to statements made to His Majesty’s Legation by more than one highly-placed Iranian official that no wheat is being exported. 4. Belgian Interests. M. Peers, a non-ferrous metal expert of the well-known Belgian Societe Metallurgique de Hoboken, who left Belgium about two months ago, has recently arrived in Tehran with his family to take up an appointment under the Ministry of Mines. Appendix “ A ' to this summary contains items of interest about Belgium and (%many gleaned from M. Peer's. 5. Iraqi Interests. (i) As the I rebizond—1 abriz route is now closed by snow, large consignments of German machinery, arms and munitions for Iran are apparently to pass thiough luikey and Iraq in transit, ihe first consignment of 511 tons is now being foiwarded via Samsun—Meydan (?)—Ekbese (?)—Bagdad—Khaniquin Further large consignments are expected. Both the Turkish and Iraqi Govern ments are reported to have given the necessary permission, and it is said the latter have also waived transit dues. (n) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 10. A lurther consular report states that the incidents have now been amicably settled. The prisoners have been exchanged, and it only remains now to settle the dispute about 1,600 heaR of sheep which it is alleged Iraqi tribesmen seized in Iranian territory. Owing to the bad feeling and suspicion which, however, exists between Iraqis and Iranians nowadays, the occurrence of similar incidents must be expected. 6. Czechoslovak and Polish Interests. (i) Czech and Polish subjects of military age, non-Jews, desirous of pro ceeding to Palestine to join the Czech forces there, have been considerably inconvenienced by the delay m obtaining Iraqi transit visas. It is now authority neceSSary to refer eacJl individual’s case to Bagdad for their (ii) The Czech community in Tehran are anxious about their future. Many of them are employed m the Skoda concern, which is directly under German bemfsent oiit V° od reason to believe that Germans are ng sent out to Han to take over the management from the Czechs who are not considered reliable. An effort will then be made to return these Czechs to the protectorate, where they can be dealt with more easily.

W '' ms “ tl &gt;'“ k™ Legation Tn 6 Iran m-T lat? “ Chancelier ” of the Czechoslovak AfS!’ T ! to 1936 ). has given a vast amount of trouble His Majesty s Legation have learned from two or three sources—His Maiestv’s Government and the High Commissioner for Palestin^that Vrba is regarded with suspicion, but it is believed that the adverse reports all came from Czechs who at present are sitting with Vrba on on unofficial committee to advise His Majesty s Legation as to the character and qualifications of Czechs who wish to join the Czech forces, to go to India for munitions work, &amp;c. M Vrba in order to escape from the protectorate, joined the German Secret Service, and’ was sent to Iran, whereupon he reported himself to the French Legation and continued to work loyally under their direction until the armistice. He then offered his services to His Majesty’s Legation at the instance of the French Military Attache and in response to a broadcast of Dr. Benes. M. Vrba has since then worked hard and loyally, without remuneration, and in his spare time from his business (Irano-Gzech Company), as an unofficial go-between for the Czechs and His Majesty s Legation in connexion with passports, enlistment, &amp;c. He has never been used as an informer. His Majesty’s Legation, in their dealings with Vrba,3 t*- have had no reason to suspect that he is anything but a good patriotic Czech. Their present concern is to endeavour to ensure that everyone concerned knows the facts and that no one is acting on old stories under the impression that they are new ones, and that Vrba will not in the future be debarred from co-operation with the Czechoslovak authorities in Palestine or elsewhere. 7. Italian Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 8. The Italian military authorities still refuse permission for the Panamanian steamship Eureka to proceed to Assab (Eritrea), and have had the impertinence to state that they would allow one of the Italian steamers now lying in Bandar Shahpur to proceed there provided that it brought lorries and petrol required for the transport of cargo and that the R.A.F. refrain from bombing the port of Assab in the meantime. O 8. German Interests. Iranian subjects returning from Berlin speak of the tremendous effect of the R.A.F. bombings on the morale of the citizens. If these bombings were continued without cessation, they would undoubtedly have far-reaching effects. 9. United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 6 (v). A further 100 tons of good quality silk cocoons have been secured with the assistance of M. Jouvel (Captain of Reserve), late Assistant French Military Attache, who is a sericulture expert in civil life. Arrangements are being made to have this silk reeled in Kashmir. 10. Iranian State Railways. (i) Reference Intelligence Summary No. 1 (current), paragraph 5 (ii). M. Hacklin, the Swedish railway constructional engineer of the Ministry of Communications, has recommended the reconstruction of the Zahidan-Nok-kundi Railway, but, in order to avoid the building of many bridges, he has suggestevi that the line should be diverted on both sides of the frontier to meet at a point north of the present alignment, and that the stations of Mirjawa (Iran) and Taftan (Baluchistan) should be rebuilt on either side of the frontier post. The Shah has approved of the above scheme, but the reconstruction of this section is to wait until the Government of India reopen the question. (ii) The Government of India have now decided to remove the disused permanent way from Nok-kundi to the Iranian frontier for emergency work in the Middle East. Thus for the present Iran will not be linked with the Indian railway system. 11. Census. The result of the census of Shiraz up to a radius of 6 the 31st January, 1941, is as follows :— Men Women Families Total 129,023 12. Tehran Hospitals. The following are the Government (civilian) hospitals in Tehran :— Number of beds. Razi ... ... ... ... ... ... 195 Sina (former Daulati) ... ... ... ... 170 Vaziri (women’s) ... ... ... ... 90 Niswan (women’s) 60 Goharshad (women’s) ... ... 50 Fowzibeh ... ... ... ... ... 60 Farabi (former municipal hospital) ... ... 80 [16—13] * b 2 kilom., carried out on 70,007 59,016 28,3274 13. Tehran University. Professor Oberling (a French subject) is doyen of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Tehran. Since his arrival over a year ago he has accom plished two difficult tasks : (i) to secure the transfer of the civil hospitals from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Education; and (ii) to get rid of very well-connected, but useless, men who were opposed to any reform. The second task was difficult, as these individuals had friends everywhere, and it could not have been accomplished without the backing of H.I.H. the Crown Prince, who is very keen on public health and backs up Professor Oberling whenever this is required. While the hospitals were under the Ministry of the Interior the training of medical students was much neglected and was largely theoretical; dissection had begun to be taught to some extent, notably by Dr. Blair, of the American Mission, but the teaching was mostly by lectures. Students learned dermatology from text-booldjhid had rarely seen a post-mortem carried out. The state of neglect that existed is illustrated by the fact that masses of splendid German instruments and apparatus which arrived years ago had never even been taken out of the cases in which they arrived. This has now been changed; students receive practical instruction in the hospitals from surgeons and doctors. Since the transfer, too, the number of operations has doubled and patients trebled. A proper civilian clinic for trachoma has been set up which deals with 100 to 150 cases a day. The medical students are very keen, and to teach them men have been found who have been trained in Europe. Foreign professors have also been engaged. There is still a serious shortage of nurses and a complete lack of persons to run the administrative side of hospitals, almoners, &amp;e. 14. A .R.P. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 2 (current), paragraph 12 (ii). The port area in Basra is now fully blacked out and the possibility of extending black-out precautions to Ashar and the city of Basra are under consideration. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache. Tehran, February 8, 1941. Appendix “ A.” (A) Belgium. 1. Before the German invasion 95 per cent, of Belgians did not wish to go to war with Germany even if they invaded their country. In consequence, the Belgian Army did not resist as much as they could have. 2. Belgians are now solidly behind their King, on whose case a great deal of propaganda has been issued. 3. The German Army of Occupation have conducted themselves with correctness and even politeness, to which the Belgians reciprocated at first. All this has now completely changed; the majority of Belgians are pro-British. There is, however, much bitterness against the French. 4. The Port of Antwerp and the docks have suffered much from the R.A.F'. bombings. M. Peers himself saw this. 5. The Germans have been experimenting with the canal barges by installing Diesel engines and even hydroplane engines. A good many barges turned turtle and German soldiers were drowned and equipment lost! Many Belgian barges and ships were fitted up for the invasion of England. The bottoms of the ships were filled with concrete to support tanks, artillery, &amp;c., and great doors fitted in the sides to allow them to be disembarked without delay. 6. The plant of the Societe Metallurgique at Hoboken, on the banks of the River Schelde, of which M. Peers is an employee, is now working at full pressure. Copper, brass, lead refining process, &amp;c., is being carried out, but raw materials will last only until February or March 1941. Raw material has come from France, after which the Germans will remove the machinery, &amp;c. Another large plant at Oolen, west of and near Herenthals, belonging’ to the same concern, is in production. The Germans re-engaged the whole of the Belgian staff of these plants. Neither of these plants has been bombed. Before the invasion thec company had sent away its stocks to places then thought to be quite safe. Its gold, silver and selenium were sent as far as Bordeaux. All these stocks when captured by the Germans were considered prize of war. 7. The Gestapo are everywhere. In spite of this, Belgians listen in to the B.B.C. and especially the Flemish broadcast. They wish it were possible to ave more. 8. Much damage was caused to communications by the fighting in Belgium and many bridges are still unrepaired owing to lack of material with which to repair them. In consequence many canals are blocked and barges cannot be got through. 9. On the 3rd December, M. Peers, with his family, travelled direct from Brussels to Berlin (Friedrichstrasse) in 17 hours by express. This is about the same time as in peace. 10. The Germans have seized everything they can in Belgium; all stores of food, raw materials, oil, &amp;c. Immediately after the occupation long lines of twelve-wheel motor transport came in to carry off grain and other stocks. The wheat and flour in Belgium will be exhausted by April, and the new harvest will not be in until September. How the population are to feed themselves—and the army of occupation—in the interval, is not known. I hirtv-five grammes of radium were discovered at Louvain and confiscated. 11. The electric train service between Brussels and Antwerp is running again, but passengers have to alight at Malines to cross the River Rupel where the bridge had been blown up. 12. German soldiers in occupied territory are not allowed to move about to other places except with special permission. Soldiers in the suburbs of Antwerp, for instance, are not allowed into the city or port area. 13. It is strictly forbidden to read propaganda leaflets. Nevertheless, many Belgians do so and pass them round their friends. (B) Berlin. 1. Little damage was seen of the R.A.F. bombings. 2. After an aerial bombardment, large gangs of workmen, glaziers, plumbers, &amp;c., set to and repair all damage caused. If this cannot be done, then the area is roped off and repairs are carried on. No expense is spared to keep up the public morale. 3. The Black Bourse, both in Belgium and Berlin, is flourishing. Germans, including high Nazi officials, try to buy United States dollars from travellers, paying at least 20 reichsmarks per dollar willingly. M. Peers himself was approached and was also asked to sell his clothes and typewriter. 4. The Iranian Mission in Berlin is very busy doing business in everything they can and apparently making huge profits! 5. White bread can be obtained in Berlin and the meat ration is double that issued in Belgium. (C) Miscellaneous. 1. Two British airmen landed by parachute in a crowded market place near Brussels. Their clothes were immediately torn off them and they were hurriedly dressed in odds and ends of clothing given by the marketers, who also kept the German police at a distance (not without casualties) until the airmen had been hidden away. 2. Much amusement and ridicule was caused when British airmen dropped some old bathing costumes with a note attached : “ For use when you decide to cross the Channel.” Supplement to Intelligence Summary No. 3.

(i) On the evening of the 21st February His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, dined at the Officers Club with the general officers of the Imperial navy, army and air force, as well as \ the officers of the Tehran garrisons. The Turkish Military Attache was again I the only foreign military attache to be invited. t u i As is usual, the Shah made a short speech, which was relayed by loud speakers to the various dining-rooms. The Shah praised the progress, zeal and lovalty of his armed forces as a whole, and mentioned the recent expansion of the army. Sarlashgar (Major-General) Ahmed Nakhchevan, acting Minister of War, ^^(H) On the afternoon of the 22nd February, the twentieth anniversary of the coup d’Etat, the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince and Princess and the voun o er princes, was present at the military review of the Tehran gaii isons and youth organisations on the Jalalieh Racecourse. A report of the review is given as Appendix “ A ”(‘) to this summary. . , , „ T . , (lii) Her Imperial Majesty the Queen, accompanied by Her Imperial Highness the Princess Shams Pahlevi. returned to Tehran on the 20th February. 2. Iranian Army. (if A consular report from Kermanshah states that Sarlashgar (Major- General) Muqaddam, General Officer Commanding 5th (Kurdistan) Division, is to be promoted sepahbod (general) at the New Year (the 21st March). (ii) The 5th (Kurdistan) Division and the 12th (Kermanshah) Division, plus the Amnieh battalions of the Pusht-i-Kuh, Kermanshah and Sannandaj districts, are to be formed into an army corps under the command of Sarlashgar (Major- General) Muqaddam, who has already fixed his headquarters at Kermanshah. (iiit Sartip (Brigadier) Assa, commanding the 12th (Kermanshah) Division, will be appointed General Officer Commanding the 5th (Kurdistan) Division. fiv) A new infantrv and cavalry regiment are being formed in the Ibth (Gilan) Divisional Area (see Intelligence Summary No. 4 (current), para- , graP ( h v ) 2 ills expected that by August 1941 a total of 500 regular officers and 1 500 reserve officers will have passed through the Officers Cadet College. (vif Four cement gun platforms were being built on the Propriete Zamani at Bandar Pahlevi directly behind the cemetery at the north-west end of the town, but work has since been stopped owing, it is said, to strong Soviet protests. These emplacements may have been for 150-mm. coast defence guns. O) Not nrinted. RECd. POL. DEPt. 23JUN 941 INDIA OFFICE [18-6]2 (vii) The aerodrome at Isfahan was used for the first time for the annual military parade on the 22nd February. Formerly the parade was always held on the ground east of the barracks. (viii) An army order has recently been circulated that no officer will use his batman as a chauffeur. So far little difference has been noticed. 3. Iranian A ir Force. (i) A large quantity of building material for the hangars of the new air bombing regiment at Doshantappeh has recently been delivered from England. . The contractors are Messrs. Boulton and Paul. (ii) It is reported that one Iranian air force warrant officer, named Naimzadeh, escaped to Russia (Askhabad) in a new Hind aircraft (Mercury engine) on the day of the review (the 22 nd February) prior to the fly-past. The pilot in question has a Russian mother. Arrangements are being made for the aircraft to be handed back. 4. British Interests. (i) Three of the British aircraft personnel of the Doshantappeh aircraft factory have received one month’s notice of termination of employment—a draughtsman, an inspector and a toolmaker. The contracts under which they are serving are not with the individuals, but with the British companies concerned, and, moreover, they contain no provision for termination except for misconduct. The three men are therefore refusing to accept the notice. (ii) The reports about the export of wheat are very confusing. One good source says that none has gone out for six months, and the Iranian Consul- General in India stated orally that wheat was being exported until seven months ago, whereas the Ministry for Foreign Affairs maintain that none has gone out for three years, and produce decisions and orders calculated to show that the export of wheat has been prohibited throughout that period. On the whole the evidence goes to show that any quantities which were going out recently were not large. His Majesty’s Minister has recommended that the balance of the first 30,000 tons should be released on grounds of general policy, and that future applications from the Imperial Government should be considered in conjunction with our desire to buy from the Imperial Government wool, &amp;c., which we want to deny to the enemy. 5. U.S.S.R. Interests. On the 23rd February the Soviet Military Attache invited all the foreign military attaches and officers, and their wives, of the Imperial Iranian army and air force to a tea-party in the Soviet Embassy in commemoration of the anniversary of the Red army. This is the first time that this has been celebrated. Many Iranian officers were present. Neither the British nor the French Military Attache was present. 6 . Communications. Yezd-Shiraz .—According to the press, a new and shorter road is being constructed between Yezd and Shiraz, shortening the distance by about 81 kilom. The new road branches off the present road at Deh-i-Shir (degree sheet 17.E.B.3), and passes through Dehrishk (degree sheet 17.E.D.2), Damak-Aliabad-Faizabad- Taft to Yezd. The new road passes close to the Dehbala district, the hill station of Yezd. 7. Census. (i) The result of the census of Kerman, up to a radius of 6 kilom., carried out on the 20th February, is as follows : — Men ... Women Families llfm } Total 50 ' 048 12^000 ' (ii) The result of the census of Yezd, up to a radius of 6 kilom., carried out on the 28th February, is as follows :— Men ... Women Families 28 822 } Total 60 ’ 066 14,5183 8 . Seismic Disturbance. A severe earthquake took place on the night of the I7th-18th February at Mohammedabad Kain (million sheet 23.C.3). Over 600 persons are reported to ^^have been killed or injured, but this number is thought to be much exaggerated. 9. Minerals. Brief information about the mineral resources of Iran is given in Appendix “ B ’C) to this summary. 10 . Climate. This winter in Iran has been an exceptionally mild one. There has been a general lack of rain and snow throughout the country. Good falls have, however, recently occurred, but the harvest is behindhand, and there may be a danger of water shortage in the summer. Fruit and nut trees are already in full blossom, over a month before the usual time. A frost now will be disastrous. H. J. UNDERWOOD. L ieutenant-C olonel, Military A ttache. Tehran, March 8 , 1941.

Hawkers Aircraft Company and the Iranian Air Attache in London that, if raw materials could not be supplied for the manufacture of “ Hurricane ” machines at Doshantappeh Aircraft Factory, then the Iranian air authorities would regretfully have to reduce the British personnel. If there was any hope of delivery of raw material to keep the factory in production, then there would be no question of any British mechanics being discharged. 6 . U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) On the 10th March, at the Cinema Tehran, and for the second time within twelve months, his Excellency the Soviet Ambassador invited the Diplomatic Corps and high Iranian Government oificials to see Soviet films.

(iv) It is reported that— ( 1 ) The frontier road running from Julfa (M.S.1.B.2) to Lenkoran (M.S.8.A.2) is being remetalled and put into a good state of repair.

Reference Intelligence Summary No. 3 (current), paragraph 7. The Iranian press again complains about the attitude of the Italian Government in refusing to allow the neutral ship Eureka to proceed from Aden to the port of Assab to take over the cargo of steamship Arabia (Lloyd Triestino). The press states that compensation will be claimed from the Italian Government. As Assab has been subjected to frequent bombing raids by the R.A.F., it is possible that the goods have been damaged.4 9. Danish Interests. A note on aerodromes in Denmark under German occupation is given in Appendix (A)( 1 ) to this Summary. 10. German Interests.

J. Underwood), carried out a reconnaissance of the ports of Bandar Pahlevi, Nau Shahr and Babulsar. (ii) The Ministry of Finance ask whether it would be permitted to use the Italian steamship Hilda, now lying at Bandar Abbas with an Iranian crew, to fetch wheat from India. . (iii) A suggestion has been made to His Majesty’s Legation (possibly from German sources) that the Germans might be willing to sell four of the ships at present interned at Bandar Shahpur for 3 million reichsmarks each, payable in marks or dollars. No encouragement was given to the enquirer. 5. Hungarian Interests. The new Hungarian Minister, Dr. Bela de Szent-Istvany, presented his letters of credence to H.I.M. the Shah on the 21st March. He did not send the usual notification to the Polish, Belgian and Netherlands Ministers, as he did to other colleagues, but some days later he wrote to the Belgian and the Netherlands Ministers expressing his hope of entering into 'personal relations.

Besides the Axis partners, Czechs, Bulgars, Roumanians, Yugoslavs were invited to see the film, but few of these nationals attended. The total number of Germans of military age who were present was about 600.

The Shah spent over two hours closely examining the exhibits. ‘ (ii) On the 30th April H.I.M. the Shah, accompanied by his Excellency Ibrahim Qavm (Qavm-ul-Mulk) and Sarlashgar (Major-General) Naqdi, left by train for a short tour in Mazandaran. 2 . Iranian Officials. (i) Mr. Abdul Samad Aliabadi, “ chef de cabinet ” of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, has been appointed Iranian Consul-General at Delhi to fill an existing vacancy. Mr. Aliabadi was formerly Iranian Consul at Bombay, where he was involved in friction with the authorities about a lawsuit. He has been warned that, if he gets into trouble again, he will be withdrawn at once. (ii) Dr. Hussain Qadimi, head of the League of Nations Department at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, has been appointed charge d’affaires at Berne. 3. Iranian Army.

(i) The single “ Hurricane ” fighter in possession of the is completely unserviceable. (ii) Night-flying practice on a small scale is still being Qila Murgha aerodrome. [19—53] RECd. POL. DEPt. i ?3 jUL 941 INDIA OFFICE Iranian air carried out force from p2 5. National Aero Club. Reference Intelligence Summary INo. 6 (current), paragraph 3 (ii). (i) This information has not been confirmed. Rearwin Airways (Incorpo rated) now refuse to send mechanics to Iran, although this was in the original eontract. The Aero Club threaten to take up the matter in the United States courts. It appears that Rearwin Airways (Incorporated) cannot spare any experts at the present time as they have their hands full with urgent United States Government contracts. (ii) The total number of twenty-five Rearwin training aircraft have now been delivered in Tehran. 6 . Iranian State Railways. (i) Tehran-Tabriz-Turkish frontier line construction programmes have been seriously delayed owing to the lack of cement and blasting powder. From Tabriz this line will be continued via Marand to Khoi and Kotur, and not via Rezaieh. (ii) According to the press, the Tehran-Meshed line will eventually be extended to the Afghan frontier (Herat) and a branch line constructed to Zahidan via Zabul. The Qum-Yezd-Kerman branch will be prolonged to Charbar. (iii) Urgent orders have recently been given for the immediate construction of ramps at all sidings of stations on the Tehran-Tabriz line. 7. British Interests. Little public interest and no official reactions to the entry of British troops into Iraq are yet apparent. The Iranian Chief of General Staff, Sarlashgar (Major-General) Zarghami, was, however, sent secretly to Khuzistan. One of his objects may well have been to find out about the British forces which had passed up the river, but the Ministry for Foreign Affairs state he was sent to inspect troop dispositions in the oil-fields area. 8 . German Interests. (i) On learning of the arrival of British troops in Iraq, the German Military Attache (Major von Goldern-Crespandorf) at once proceeded to Bandar Shahpur and Khorramshahr. (ii) German business firms here received orders from the German Legation to forward all their mail by means of the diplomatic bag. (iii) Messrs. Siemens (Iran) have obtained the contract for the planning of the hydro-electric scheme and damming of the Kerej River. 9. Italian Interests. His Excellency the Italian Minister (Signor L. Petrucci) has been visiting the Italian ships lying at Bandar Shahpur. He also travelled via Shiraz to Kerman, where he met the master of the motor vessel Hilda, lying off Bandar Abbas. 10. U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) On the 14th April the Soviet-lran frontier in Azerbaijan and the Bandar Pahlevi-Baku route were suddenly closed for unknown reasons. At the time there were strong rumours of Soviet troop movements towards the Western European frontiers and manoeuvres in the Caucasus. The frontier appears to have now been reopened for travellers in possession of diplomatic visas and ordinary travellers are being allowed to travel that way with effect from the 1 st May. The Soviet Embassy have advanced various reasons for the closing of the route : Overhaul of steamers, manoeuvres, and congestion on the railways because of the flood of passengers to Moscow for the parade on the 1 st May. This route was closed for a few days at the same time of year in 1940. (ii) General anxiety as to Russia's intentions is again apparent among the public. It is considered that, if Germany occupies Turkey, Russia will defend her interests by occupying at least part of Iran.3 11 . United States Interests. \r^ S Excellenc y American Minister (Mr. L. G. Dreyfus, Jr.), accompanied by Mrs. Dreyfus and Mr. H. B. Minor, first secretary, intends making his first visit to Kabul, Afghanistan, early in May in order to present his letters of credence. 12 . Japanese Interests. The new minister is extremely pro-Axis and aggressive. At his first call on the Turkish Ambassador he asked why Turkey was not on the side of Germany. To the American Minister he was even more impertinent, saying that Mr. Roosevelt ought to realise that Japan must expand, that the trouble between the United States and Japan was due to false reports made by American missionaries and that the democratic Powers had better retreat to Iceland. 13. The Press. The Japanese newspaper Assahi was severely reprimanded by the Iranian senior official newspaper Ittilaat for the publication of false news about Iran. According to this Iranian newspaper, it was reported that Iranian troops were concentrated in Azerbaijan, that the Baku—Tehran airline had been stopped and that the Soviet-Iran frontier was recently closed. In its reply, it points out that there has never been a Baku—Tehran airline in existence and that the other stories, too, are false* It is, however, interesting to note that the Soviet- Iran frontier has, however, been closed since the 14th April. The Times correspondent in Tokyo was also taken to task for telegraphing news to London of Soviet troop movements in the Caucasus. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attdche.

(i) On the 14th May H.I.M. the Shah returned from his tour in Mazanderan and Gilan. (ii) On the 9 th May T.I.H. the Crown Prince and Princess, accompanied by H.I.H. the Princess Ashraf Pahlevi, left for a tour along the Caspian littoral. (iii) On the 6 th May the fifth statue of the Shah to be erected in Tehran alone was unveiled by the Prime Minister, his Excellency Ali Mansur, at the west end of the Khiaban Shah Reza, close to Tehran University. 2. Iranian Officials. M. Ghulam Reza Nurzad (Military Attache's Personalities No. 204, and Foreign Office No. 149) is to be transferred to Istanbul as Iranian Consul-General. 3. Iranian Army. (i) Two new divisions are being formed : one, No. 17, at Khoi. and the other, No. 18, at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. At present the local garrisons form the nucleus of these divisions. (ii) Some disaffection is reported in the Iranian Tank Regiment and Iranian Air Force. The junior officers have been heard to speak openly against the present regime in front of private soldiers. Three cases of sabotage of tanks have occurred in the II Division. (iii) Iranian troops of provincial divisions have been sent to reinforce all Iraqo-Iran frontier posts as a precautionary measure. 4. Iranian Air Force. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 5 (current), paragraph 3 (ii). On Friday, the 10th May, at Sarrakhs, the Soviet authorities handed back the Hind aircraft which had been flown to Askabad by an Iranian Air Force deserter. The machine has since been flown back to Tehran. 5. British Interests. The British aircraft personnel are gradually falling in numbers, and it is possible that in a few weeks only a few will be left, one of them the technical adviser. 6 . Czech Interests. (i) It is reported that the Germans are manoeuvring through friendly parties for an approach to the Government of India to allow some of the Skoda establish ments in India to reopen. These establishments would be entirely Czech with “ very friendly ” Czechs in charge. [19—54] RECd. POL. DEPt. 1 M 941 INDIA OFFICE2 x (ii) Seventeen Czechs have succumbed to pressure and taken out German papers. The fact that only one Czech has been accepted so far for armaments work in India is said to have discouraged the Czechs, but, on the other hand, the Czechs have been very dilatory in producing their record of service and qualifications for transmission to India. 7. U.S.S.R. Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 6 (current), paragraph 6 (iv), ( 2 ) and (3). (i) The Baku-Ordubad-Julfa railway line is not yet open for traffic. About 30 kilom. of rails have still to be laid. (ii) The new branch line Aji Kabul-Lenkoran-Astara is stated to have been begun. The following are the stations :— Aji Kabul. Zubishi (Bishli Bigli ?). Bichoff ? Perishoff ? Hasanli ? Yeddibimakh. Nikolayevka. Bura Digya. Lenkoran. Shah Agach. Archevan. Astara. (iii) The Soviet Ambassador, M. Filimonov, is being replaced very shortly by M. Smirnoff, formerly counsellor to the Soviet Embassy at Berlin. It was stated that he would “ enter into negotiations,” and it is thought that these negotiations may have something to do with Russian fears of Germany. 8 . Iraqi Interests. (i) Saiyid Shakir-al-Wadi, Iraqi Charge d ! Affaires, has been recalled to Bagdad. He left on the 13th May. Papers requesting the Iranian Government to recognise Talib-al-Mushtaq as his successor are on the way. Mushtaq was Iraqi Consul in Jerusalem until recently, when his openly anti-British attitude compelled the High Commissioner to ask for his recall. (ii) Hikmat Sulaiman, who became Prime Minister of Iraq after the coup cTEtat of Bekir Sidqi three years ago, and was afterwards exiled, recently received permission from the Iraqi Government to come to Iran. He is living- in Tehran. (iii) Two anti-Rashid Ali refugees have reached Tehran—Saiyid Baqir, of the Regent’s entourage, and Salih Jabar, who was arrested by the Rashid Ali Government because of his inactivity when the Regent fled to Basra. 9. Polish Interests. A party of twenty-eight Poles (Jews) of military age who arrived from Russia have been held up in Iran for Iraqi transit visas. The police have now transferred them to Meshed, and are endeavouring to expel them from Iran. The Government of India have refused them the right of transit through India. Further numbers of Poles and Czechs are expected here now that the Balkan, and possibly the Turkish, route is closed. It is reported that General Headquarters, Middle East, advised all British Missions in the Middle East that Poles were urgently required for military service and that every endeavour should be made to help them along. 10. German Interests. The German Legation here is very active in organising help for Rashid Ali's Government in Iraq. Several parties of Germans have left for Northern Iraq and Kurdistan. An application for a transit visa for Herr Grobba, the late German Minister in Bagdad, to return to his post is stated to have been presented to the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but was refused. It is reported that Dr. Grobba has since arrived in Bagdad via Turkey. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache.

DEPt. 1 ? AUG , 941 INDIA OFFICE2 4. British Interests. (i) The Government of India have signed a contract with the Imperial Iranian Government for the purchase of all salt available on the island of Hormuz. This measure has forestalled Japanese plans for the exploitation of this island. ^ (ii) The Acting Minister of Finance has informed the commercial secretary to His Majesty’s Legation that the Imperial Government would like to purchase many things in India, including guns, machine guns and ammunition. It is known that some of the articles specified cannot be spared, and one or two, e.g., raw hides, cannot be supplied without benefiting Germany, but consideration of the proposals can do no harm. His Majesty’s Legation have therefore suggested to India that the business man whom it is proposed to send to Tehran to investi gate the possibilities of trade between India and Iran should be sent soon. 5. German Interests. (i) The Polish Minister recently learned from a source who claimed to have obtained the information from General Nakhchevan, Acting Minister of War, that German agents had recently been taking photographs and obtaining other details of air-fields of Iran, particularly in South Iran and Khuzistan. (ii) The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs declares ( 1 ) that the enemy vessels at Bandar Shahpur are not sending out wireless messages : the wireless sets on board are still sealed, and careful listening has detected no transmission; ( 2 ) that an open and careful search has discovered no explosives or other preparations for sabotage. 6 . Norwegian Interests. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 11, paragraph 6 (i) and (ii). All the Norwegian volunteers have now been despatched by returning transports to Bombay. 7. Iraqi Interests. On the 3rd June a large number of Iraqi refugees, including Rashid Ali, the “ Golden Four,’' the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem and other notables—the names of some of whom are given below—arrived by car in Tehran. Most of the cars were without numbers and were brand new. The refugees took up residence in various hotels of the city pending arrangements for other accommodation. Rashid Ali got into touch with the German and Italian Legations. After a few days the Imperial Government informed the leaders that they must live in houses, not in hotels, and must refrain from political activities. The following are some of the notables who have arrived recently :— Amin Zakki, Commander-in-chief. Baud Saadi, Minister of Justice. Yunus Sabbawi. Hussein-ed-din, Major. Hussein, Lieutenant of S.S. Police. Abdul Jubbar, Lieutenant. Salahuddin, General. 8 . U.S.S.R. Interests. On the 8 th June his Excellency the Soviet Ambassador.

(i) H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence at the Palace of Saadabad. (ii) On the 18th June the Iranian press published laudatory articles with a photograph of H.I.H. Prince Mahmoud Reza Pahlevi. This scion of the house of Pahlevi is reported to have obtained the highest marks in the final examination of the IHrd Class (Secondary School) of the year 1320. The subservience of Iranian examiners towards the sons of influential men is well known. 2. Iranian Army. (i) On learning of the fall of Assab, the Iranian War Minister immediately made enquiries as to the possibility of shipping the Iranian military stores, ex steamship Arabia (Lloyd Triestino), which have been lying there since the entry of Italy into the war. H.I.M. the Shah is particularly interested in obtaining this cargo. k^- 7 (ii) No. 7 Artillery Regiment is stationed at Gurgan and not at Meshed.

They are proceeding to Canada and England for training in the Royal Air Force and Dutch navy. Most of them are deserters from German and Dutch ships. 5. Soviet Interests. (i) The direct railway line between Julfa-Ordubad to Baku has recently been completed. This line is known as the “ new military line ” and will not be used for ordinary goods and passenger traffic in the meantime. [20—56] | RECd. POL. DEPt. j 2.8AUG 941 | INDIA OFFICE2 x (ii) It is reported that a narrow-gauge railway already exists between Azi Kabul-Lenkoran. This is being extended to Astara, and may later be converted into ordinary Russian gauge. (iii) Iranians generally are delighted at the German attack on Russia, but they do not seem to look beyond the present and to speculate on what will happen to them if the Germans come down to the borders of Iran. (iv) It is reported that the Soviet military authorities have already given orders for the sabotage of the oil-fields, pipe-line and oil port at Batum and Baku should the Germans attack the Caucasus. (v) The Soviet authorities are interested in engaging Czechoslovak and other foreigners as specialists for coal-mines, glass-works, textiles and armament works. 6 . Iraqi Interests. (i) The Iraqi refugees still remain in Tehran. The ex-Mufti of Jerusalem is said to be constantly quarrelling with Rashid Ali owing to their differing opinions as to how, and particularly when, the rising in Iraq should have taken place. The ex-Mufti is of the opinion that the outbreak should not have taken place until German help was at hand, but Rashid Ali rushed things. The ex-Mufti’s special friend is Musa Shahbanda’s (the ex-Foreign Minister) brother. (ii) A new Iraqi Minister, Daud-al-Haidari, has recently arrived in Tehran. 7. German Interests.

(i) The French Military Attache, Chef de Bataillon Alessandri. has recently received a reprimand from the Ministry of War at Vichy for his indiscretion at being seen about too often in public with the British Military Attache. He has been warned that, if further complaints are received from the Joint Franco-German Armistice Commission, he will be relieved immediately. (ii) Professor Girshman of the Louvre Museum Archseological Mission in Iran has been ordered to proceed to Afghanistan to take over the French ^archaeological work in that country.

(ii) On the 25th June the Iranian press contained a strong rebuke on the Italian radio station of Bari for its broadcast of the 24th June, which apparently stated that Iran was about to attack Russia to regain her former provinces in the Caucasus. 10. Roumanian Interests. The Roumanian Government, after closing down the Roumanian Legation in Tehran in November 1940, have again sent diplomatic representatives. The new Roumanian Minister is M.

H I M. the Shah and the Imperial family continue in residence at the summer palace of Saadabad. 2 . Iranian Army. (i) A large number of motor lorries were commandeered recently in Tehran for the transport of war material and stores to garrisons in North-West Iran. (ii) Five Iranian divisions are being brought up to strength : two are ear marked for Abadan, one for Rawanduz area, one for Kermanshah and one for Julfa. (iii) The Iranian authorities have been so importunate about their goods at Assab that His Majesty’s Minister asked the Prime Minister whether he could not imagine the situation of General Headquarters, Cairo, with several campaigns on their hands at once, and of the Governor of Assab clearing away the wreckage of war, dealing with prisoners of war, enemy deserters and spies; trying to get trade started again and depleted food stores augmented; endeavouring to set the civil administration going again with half the officials gone, and so on. The Prime Minister seemed to understand, but that is not sufficient: he has to awaken comprehension in the mind of his arbitrary Sovereign. 3. Iranian Air Force. (i) A British Royal Air Force n.c.o. has arrived in Tehran on arrangements made by the Air Ministry for the installation of a Link Trainer at Doshantappeh Airport. (ii) The first consignment of Hurricane material is on the point of leaving the United Kingdom. 4. National Aero Club. The Rearwin training machines are now being assembled at Doshantappeh. Four have already been flown and passed as satisfactory. 5. Iranian State Railways. (i) Tehran—Tabriz—Kotur (Turkish frontier) Line. Mianeh—Miandoab Section. —This section is being carried on very slowly owing to lack of cement. [ 21 — 12 ] RECd. POL. DEPt. 240CT ;941 I INDIA OFFICEdynamite and money for the contractors. The programme is now very much behindhand. (ii) Qum-Kashan-Yezd .—This branch line is complete except for the laying of rails, which are en route from the United States. 6 . French Interests. (i) On the 9th July his Excellency M. Jean Helleu, the French Minister, left for Angora, where he has been appointed ambassador. M. Jacques Coiffard is acting as charge d’affaires. (ii) Two young French officers, MM. R. Flottes and Gilbert Bachelet, have arrived in Tehran, via Moscow, having escaped from a German prison camp between Hamburg and Liibeck. They are at present remaining in Tehran recovering from their experiences. 7. German Interests. There are indications that during the first days of the Russo-German war the Germans in Iran made preparations to leave, probably because they feared that the Russians and the British would take some action against them. It is said that about the 2nd July they received the order to stand fast. 8 . U.S.S.R. Interests. (i) On the 5th July M. Andre Smirnoff, the new Soviet Ambassador, was received in audience by His Imperial Majesty the Shah at the Gulistan Palace and presented his letters of credence. Unlike his predecessor, who was obviously a figure-head, M. Smirnoff is clearly an executive official. He has had diplomatic experience in Germany and elsewhere, and speaks very good German. He appears to want to co-operate with His Majesty’s Legation. (ii) Colonel Vasili Alexandrov, Red Army Tank Corps and military attache at Tehran, left Tehran on the 2nd July for active service. (iii) Colonel Mastoff, the new Soviet Military Attache, arrived in Tehran on the 9th July, and immediately established contact with the British Military Attache. (iv) His Majesty’s Government are examining the possibility of transit trade with the U.S.S.R. via Iran. 9. Hungarian Interests. On the 30th June the Hungarian Minister, his Excellency Bela de Szent Istvany, died suddenly from heart failure. 10. Iraqi Interests. , T . W ^h July his Excellency Baud Pasha al Haidari, the new Iraqi .Minister, was received in audience by the Shah at the Gulistan Palace, and presented his letters of credence. (ii) Rashid Ali, the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem, and the other Iraqi refugees continue to reside in lehran. Ihey are frequently seen in public. 11. Iranian Press. On the 9th July the Iranian press published an article Technicians employed in Iran’s Industry and Commerce” the following numbers and nationalities employed •— entitled ” Foreign This article shows “ English ” Russians . Germans . Italians Czechs Swiss Greeks Yugoslavs 2.590 390 690 310 180 70 260 140 The Prime Minister informed His Majesty’s Minister that the object t he Imperial Go\eminent in publishing these figures was to correct exaggerate reports in the foreign press that there were 5,000 or 10,000, or 25,000, Germai m I ran - Put there is no doubt that the Imperial Government also wished 1convince the reader that the “ German menace ” is a myth since there are far more “ English ” and Russian subjects than German in Iran. According to the Soviet Embassy, the figures of Soviet subjects include a large number of people who are only in Iran in order to take delivery of goods which have been bought. ^-As to the “ English,” there are several points calling for comment — ( 1 ) Three fifths of the alleged “ English ” are Indians. (2) With a few exceptions all the British are in the oil area, whereas the Germans are scattered about, often in key positions, in railways, arsenals, the broadcasting station, &amp;c. (3) The maintenance of the supply of oil from Iran is a major British interest,^in that His Majesty’s Government are interested in the independence and integrity of Iran, whereas Germany has shown that she is interested in the disintegration of small nations as a preliminary to occupation or domination, and that her subjects abroad are all enrolled for Fifth Column work.

Tehran, July 26, 1941. (Secret.) Intelligence Summary No. 15 for the period ending July 26, 1941. 1 . The Shah and the Imperial Family. H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial Family continue in residence at the summer palace of Saadabad. 2. Persian A rmy. A consular report from Kermanshah states : — (a) During the first week of July the military garrison at Sanandaj received from Tehran eighteen anti-aircraft guns (type unknown). The Kermanshah Division has also received twelve A.A. guns (type unknown), of which five have been retained at Kermanshah and seven have been sent to military posts near the Iraq frontier, viz : Qasr-i-Shirin, Naft-i-Shah. and Soumar (in the Pusht-i-Kuh district). (h) The Kermanshah divisional budget has been credited with 7 million rials, which is to be used for the construction of three large barracks at Qasr-i-Shirin, Naft-i-Shah, and at Soumar. The construction of these barracks has been commenced. It has been decided to maintain permanently at Qasr-i-Shirin, when the new barracks are completed, a garrison of one “ hang,” i.e., about 1,200 infantry and a small detachment of artillery. (c) The military forces of the Kermanshah district have recently started carrying out manoeuvres by night; these night operations have been staged in the neighbourhood of Ruwansar (about 30 miles north of Kermanshah). (d) It is reported that many conscripts (especially those who have a little money of their own), when called up to do their “refresher ” course of one month’s service, have recently been threatened with severe disciplinary measures and harsh treatment if they do not pay five hundred rials to the Officer Commanding their unit. Discipline among the troops continues to be poor, and many soldiers are without clothing and equipment, the latter having been sold by officers to raise funds to supplement their small salaries. (e) Sarhang Sharif-Zadeh, Officer Commanding the 39th Regiment at Kermanshah, almost daily shows himself to be very pro-German and is reliably reported to have harangued his troops on numerous occasions recently in terms such as the following :— “ I want you to be like the German soldiers, each of whom is able to capture hundreds of British soldiers. Don’t you know that as soon as a German soldier shows himself to a large number of British soldiers all the latter run away without resisting. This is the spirit which all of you should show.”2 3. Persian Air Force. (i) On the 14th July a Hawker Audax machine (Hornet engine) belonging to No. 4 Air Regiment at Ahwaz crashed in flames. The pilot was burnt to death. (ii) When unloading by crane one of the new “ Tomahawk ” fighters at Ahwaz, the case slipped from the crane and the machine was badly damaged. | 4. National Aero Club. Sixteen Rearwin training machines have now been passed as airworthy. One has already been badly damaged owing to a collision in taxiing to the hangars. 5. German interests. (i) The German Minister is very optimistic and believes firmly that the Shah will fight against the entry of Soviet and English troops into Persia. (ii) The German Legation have in their possession a special broadcasting set which can be heard throughout Persia. A propaganda service will be instituted as soon as trouble breaks out in Persia. 6 . A rmenians in Persia. A note on Armenian organisation in Persia is given as an Appendix to this Summary. 7. Topographical Notes. (i) Degree Sheet ION, D.3. Add Height of Ardekan : 7,500 feet. Height of Ardekan Pass (motor road), 9,600 feet (the highest point is about at the letter A of the capital letters BARMO). Name of the peak marked 12160 : Runj-i-Gambul. This name appears on Sheet 17B, but would also apply here. (ii) Degree Sheet 17C. For ‘‘ Kuh-i-Darak ” read “ Kuh-i-Barfi ” (c. 9,000 feet). For ‘ Kuh-i-Barfi ” read “ Kuh-i-Kalat,” which name applies to the whole mountain between Kalat and Paskuhak. The village Paskuhak (not marked) lies approximately on the letter S of the big capitals SHIRAZ, i.e., 52° 18'F., 29° 45'N. The river running thence to Shiraz should not be marked in blue, as it dries up in summer. (iii) Reference M.T. Routes in Persia, 1939, vol. II, p. 583, Route 115. This route only exists from Shiraz to Firuzabad, the construction of the rest being abandoned for the time being. Bifurcations for motor transport along this road occur at 19 kilom., 30 kilom. and 95 kilom. from Shiraz respectively, the first running to Sarvistan! the second to Jahrum from the Gardaneh Babi Haji, the third leaving the Tang-Ab gorge and running towards Maimand. Bridges : Kavar new bridge, 59 kilom. from Shiraz. Also a single-arch, equally solid, new bridge over a water-course at 92 kilom. from Shiraz, just before entry of Tang-Ab gorge. (iv) Degree Sheet 17F. Only the road from Deh Bid to Abadeh over the Quli Kush pass is possible for motor transport; the other northward route from Deh Bid should therefore not be equally marked on the map. 8 . Allied Policy towards Persia. Both His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are becoming increasingly perturbed at the presence of numerous Germans in Persia and the potential danger which they constitute to British Imperial interests. Now that Britain is in alliance with Soviet Russia, our interests no longer clash in the same way as during the past years, and the Soviet Government have shown their willingness to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government in trying to eliminate this common danger. His Majesty’s Minister and the Soviet Ambassador have accordingly, on instructions from their respective Governments, made parallel representations to the Imperial Government in order to try to secure at least a reduction in the number of Germans in Persia. There are indications that the Imperial Government are beginning to realise that a German victory over Russia50 3 might well expose Persia to unpleasant consequences, and it is thought probable that, while they will hesitate to go to any great lengths in expelling Germans from the country, they will take steps to remove some at least of the most notorious Fifth Columnists. It is thought that, if some of the ringleaders are y-^thus removed, others with guilty consciences will also leave of their own accord. Pending the result of these representations becoming known, His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are considering ways in which they can bring economic pressure to bear on Persia with a view to obtaining their desiderata. At the same time investigations are being carried out to see how the transport system of Persia can be exploited, and if necessary improved, to act as a channel of supply to Russia. In all these matters His Majesty’s Minister is ostentatiously maintaining cordial relations with the Soviet Ambassador, and it is thought that this is having quite a considerable effect on opinion here. 10.

In Persia there is considerable dissension among the various scattered Armenian communities living in that country with Persian nationality. In Tehran the majority perhaps are pro-German and carry on organised propaganda amongst themselves. The labouring communities living at Julfa, near Isfahan, and in the villages to the south-west, many of whom were formerly employed by the A.I.O.C., are very divided and constantly quarrelling. Perhaps 50 per cent, of them are Dashnaks, and, of these, many are pro-Russian. Few of them are pro-British, though many of their children have been sent to Calcutta for education. Practically all the Armenian communities in Persia are oppressed by the Shah’s policy directed toward their non-employment, and many of them would undoubtedly be a force to be seriously reckoned with in case of revolution. There are, of course, elements employed by the A.I.O.C. upon whom that company could probably count in case of emergency, especially those employed for, say, over twenty years. 2. German Propaganda among Armenians. The alleged new and intensive German propaganda with the object of organising a body against the Soviet Government in the Caucasus, though it includes doubtless any Armenians available, is also directed toward Russians, either White, Pink or otherwise disaffected, but chiefly probably toward the Azerbaijanis both in Persia and in the Caucasus. The object is the organisation of a strong body near Baku, Batum and other points where the “ Scorched Earth ” policy of Stalin would have the maximum effect against one of the main German objectives of the war against Russia, viz., the oil resources of the Caucasus. Many Azerbaijanis left the Caucasus after the revolution and, with those living in Persia itself, form a large and formidable element, containing amongst them numbers who hold important positions, and who are now promised by the Germans restitution,of the estates, positions, and their establishment in a' new Government of the country under the Axis. No doubt the natural leaning of the Azerbaijanis towards the Turks is also being exploited to the full, and there is evidence that Berlin is now very busy in assuming the championship of the Caucasian Federation elements both in Germany, Turkey and Persia.[22—36] THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF H|S^BJ^T/iNNIC !

(i) H.I.M. the Shah and the Imperial family continue in residence at the summer palace of Saadabad. (ii) On the 21st August (Mabass) H.I.M. the Shah, attended by H.I.H. the Crown Prince, held his usual levee at the Gulistan Palace. 2. The Persian Army. (i) Five classes of reservists have been called up for emergency service. (ii) Units, munitions and supplies continue to be sent to Khuzistan, Kermanshah and Azerbaijan Provinces. (iii) On the 19th August, at the summer collective training camp of the Officers’ Cadet College, H.I.M. the Shah, accompanied by H.I.H. the Crown Prince, presented commissions to 964 cadet officers, included among whom was H.I.H. Prince Ali Reza Pahlevi. Sarlashgar (Major-General) Yazdan Panah (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 301, and Foreign Office No. 212 ), commandant of the Officers’ Cadet College, read the annual report, after which H.I.M. the Shah addressed the newly commissioned officers in the following words :— “ At this moment, when you students of the Officers’ Cadet College have just completed your studies and are about to receive your commissions, we congratulate you. We hope that in the future, as a result of your good services and devotion to duty, you will gain high rank and important appointments. “ Perhaps certain among you regret that this year you have had to forgo your annual leave, but you will understand the reasons for this later, and we think that these reasons will serve only to increase your zeal and sacrifice. There is no necessity for us to draw your attejition to your duty and the critical situation here. We merely content ourselves to say simply that it is necessary that the army and its officers interest themselves greatly in this critical hour and, in case of need, be ready to make all sacrifices.” The “ passing-out ” ceremony of the Officers' Cadet College usually takes place in September, but this year, owing to the international situation, the ceremony was advanced by one month. The newly commissioned officers left to join their respective units on the night of the 19th-20th August. Forty-two senior officers, who had attended the annual course at the Eoffe superieure de Guerre, were also awarded diplomas.2 (iv) According to the Soviet Military Attache, five pew cavalry regiments are being formed as follows :— 26th Cavalry Regiment at Tabriz : III Division. 27th Cavalry Regiment at Senneh : IV Division. 28th Cavalry Regiment at Ahwaz : VI Division. 29th Cavalry Regiment at Gurgan : X Division. 30th Cavalry Regiment at Resht: XI Division. 3. British Interests. (i) On Saturday, the 16th August, the Soviet Ambassador and the British Minister in Tehran made parallel representations to the Imperial Government about the desirability of eliminating most of the Germans in Persia. The repre sentations, which were reinforced by memoranda, were detailed, and requested that the Imperial Government should furnish details of their programme of reduction and lists of Germans already gone or to go in the future. It was proposed that a minimum number of Germans might be retained if really necessary for the industry of the country, provided they should not be employed in communications or other positions dangerous to the Imperial Government and that they should not be personally suspect. On the 19th August the Imperial Government replied putting up a much more limited scheme and refusing to supply written details. The matter is now being considered by the British and Soviet Governments. (ii) Mr. M. H. Ismail, a trade representative from the Government of India, arrived in Tehran on the 19th August. 4. United States Interests. Colonel Francis P. Tomkins, United States Cavalry, has arrived in Tehran to take up the appointment of military attache. 5. Italian Interests. There are four Italian subjects still in the employ of the Persian naval forces of the south, as follows :— Three engineers : Gina, Zakola, Traldi. One deep-sea diver : Bonero. 6 . German Interests.

(iii) Railway construction progress report up to end of July 1941 :— (a) Mianeh-Maraqheh-Tabriz-Kotur. —From Mianeh up to the end of Lot 14 (about 80 kilom. from Mianeh) 20-30 per cent, completed. From Lot 15 to Tabriz 5-15 per cent, of earthwork completed. All lots up to Tabriz have been constructed and work is going on slowly. Cement is urgently required. Contractors have not been given regular advances, therefore work may be closed down indefinitely soon. Tabriz-Kotur, only survey work is going on.

(M.S.15.C.4) and Bandar Gaz (M.S.15.D.4) are gradually being silted up by the subsidence of the Caspian Sea itself and lack of dredging facilities. (ii) H.I.M. the Shah has ordered the Persian Railway Administration to carry out a survey of a new branch line between Shahi and the new port at Nau Shahr via Babul and Babulsar, the seaside resort where H.I.M. himself owns a large hotel. A commission, composed of members of the Railway Administration, the Ministry of Roads, and contractors, have been in Mazanderan Province on a reconnaissance of the proposed new line. It is reported that this railway could be constructed within four months. The most serious problems are the building of bridges, of which more than 26 would be required. Provisional bridges would have to be built at first, gradually replacing them later with permanent constructions. In view of the possible supply to Russia of war material and goods through Persia this branch line may have to be constructed in the immediate future. 9. National Aero Club. H.I.M. the Shah and all the members of the Imperial Family have given further donations to the funds of the Aero Club. Since its foundation the total sum subscribed by the house of Pahlevi has been 1,005,000 rials (£5,853 at 170 rials per £). H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache.

U^-4-OLTLfi. The Shah and the Imperial Family. SHAH Reza abdicated on the 16th September and went to Isfahan, where the Queen already was, with his younger sons. A few days later he went to Kerman. , 2 . The Crown Prince was proclaimed Shah and took the oath of fidelity to the Constitution on the 17th September. He has, according to a statement in the local press, presented all his father’s property to the State. 3. The new Shah has sent numerous messages to His Majesty’s Minister, assuring him of his loyal and whole-hearted co-operation. He has, however, enquired indirectly whether it is our desire to administer the country ourselves jointly with the Russians or to allow a Persian Government to govern. If the latter, then he asks how any Government can have authority while the capital is surrounded by foreign troops. 4. The abdication of Reza Shah was greeted with almost universal relief throughout the country, considerably damped as regards the capital by the news of the approach of British and Russian troops. 5 . The young Shah received a fairly spontaneous welcome on his first public appearance, possibly due rather to relief at the disappearance of his father than to public affection for himself. 6 . Estimates of the young Shah’s character vary considerably. He apparently maintained close relations with the German Legation, but this may have been politic. He is not credited with much strength of character, which, if true, may suit present circumstances. It would be unwise to assume that he will inevitably be a bad Sovereign. In any case, no alternative presented itself, nor could any have been without considerable delay and a welter of intrigue. The present Shah, if unsuitable, can be got rid of later. In the meantime, it should be possible U) prevent him from doing much harm. 7 On the 23rd September it was officially announced in Parliament that the new Shah had made munificent gifts to the nation. These are shown in Appendix B to this summary. Persian Officials. 8 Sarhang (Colonel) Radsar (Adib-as-Saltaneh) has been appointed officiating Chief of the Imperial Persian Police Force vice Sarlashgar (Major- General) ^Rukhn-ud-din Mukhtar, relieved ™ ^ 9 . M. Khalil Fahimi (Military Attache Personalities No. 82, loreign Office No 65) has been appointed Ustandar (Governor-General) of Ustan III, West Azerbaijan, vice M. Muzaffar Alam (Military Attache Personalities No. 12, Foreign Office No. 9). [23—25] R6$». l»OL v »ffPT, ) 9NQV1941 INDIA OFFICE10. M. Amanullah Ardalan (Military Attache Personalities No. 33, Foreign Office No. 27) has been reappointed Ustandar (Governor-General) of Ustan IV, East Azerbaijan. M. Ardalan deserted his post on hearing of the Soviet advance into Azerbaijan. 11. A nominal roll of the new Persian Government who were introduced to the Majlis on the 21 st September is given as an appendix to this summary. Persian Affairs. Political. 12. The Government in being, when the invasion began, resigned—it was, in fact, dismissed by the Shah—almost immediately and was replaced by a Government under the premiership of M. Mohammed Ali Foroughi. The latter is a man who commands almost universal respect. Some changes have since been made. The present constitution of the Cabinet is given in Appendix A. 13. The Premier has, on the whole, handled very well an extremely difficult situation. The highly-centralised administration, where all real authority was retained by the Shah, was thrown out of gear, firstly, by the invasion and, secondly, by the abdication of the Shah. There is now on the part of the Premier and of others a genuine desire to co-operate with us. 14. The chief sentiments prevailing among the Persian people at present may be said to be : resentment at the Allied military occupation and, in a lesser degree, at the Shah’s policy that brought it about; relief at the departure of Reza Shah; a deep-seated fear and distrust of the Russians; and a strong sense of humiliation. There is at the same time among a number of Persians a realisa tion that facts must be faced and that the way to make the best of a bad job is to co-operate with us. If this is what we want, then humiliation should not go further. Internal Security. 15. The complete collapse of such prestige as the Persian army may have had and the confusion caused in the Central Administration by the removal of Reza Shah’s strong hand have inevitably encouraged lawlessness in the provinces. This has been aggravated in certain areas by the number of arms sold or thrown away by deserters from the Persian army. Deserters themselves and the large number of unpaid labourers thrown out of work by the closing dowm of railway and road construction in the occupied areas are a further potential source of disorder. ... 16. In Pars and Isfahan provinces the Qashqai and Bakhtiari tribes are restless; robberies have already occurred on the roads. The tribes are, however, as a result of the policy of Reza Shah, without cohesion and without leaders of influence. This, while it renders any serious tribal movement unlikely, tends to encourage irresponsible disorder. 17. In Kurdistan, which lies between the areas occupied by British and Russian forces, serious disorder prevails and Kurdish tribesmen are reported to have seized the towns of Saqqiz and Baneh. 18. In Azerbaijan there is considerable unrest. The Persian administra tion broke down completely and is slow in being re-established. The Russians do not greatly concern themselves to prevent robbery by Persian subject of Persian subject. Among the people, who are mostly of Armenian or Turkish race, there is bitter resentment against the Persian Government. The secessionist movement grows in strength and appears to be encouraged by the Russians. Economic. 19. There is a shortage of tea, sugar and wheat throughout the country, aggravated probably by hoarding and by the cessation, or at least serious curtail ment, of supplies from the Russian-occupied areas. This is felt particularly in the capital, which depends largely on the northern provinces for rice, meat and charcoal. Persian Army. 20. The resistance put up by the Persian army to British and Russian troops was even less effective than was anticipated by its severest critics. This was due in main part to its own lack of morale. But there was also an almost entire lack of serious preparation for resistance; there were no fortifications nor even entrenched positions worthy of the name. So much so that it appeared that there3 '3\°c never had been any serious intention of resisting. It is generally believed that up to the last moment the Shah was confident that Great Britain and Russia would not go to extreme lengths, and this optimism reflected itself in the faulty dispositions of the army. Moreover, no A.R.P. measures had been taken in the towns, with the result that the first hint of aerial bombardment created panic, whioifcpread rapidly to the headquarters of military formations. These with drew with speed and their troops disintegrated. 21 . The causes of the poor morale of the Persian troops are not hard to find : the rank and file underfed and underpaid; senior officers corrupt; lack of training for modern warfare and in the use of the very good weapons they possessed; and an almost complete absence of supply arrangements. To these may be added the conviction prevailing among certain officers that war against Great Britain and Russia was a madness of the Shah. 22. Demoralisation quickly spread through the Persian army. The 5 th and 12th Divisions, which had been on the front of the 10 th Indian Division, and the 3rd, 4th, 11 th and 15th Divisions on the Russian front in North-West Persia disintegrated. The 9th and 10th Divisions in Khorassan are reported to be considerably disorganised, but the 6 th and 16th, which were engaged with the 8 th Indian Division in Khuzestan, are reported still to have units with some cohesion. 23. The demoralisation spread to troops who had not been engaged in operations. ^ Desertions were reported from the forces in Ears and Isfahan provinces. The 1 st and 2nd Divisions in Tehran were little affected until the arrival of Russian troops at Tehran. The latter occupied most of the Persian barracks, evicting the Persian troops. Desertions then began on a large scale, running to hundreds a night. Steps have been taken to round up these deserters in unoccupied areas and areas occupied by British troops, but the Russian troops will allow no armed Persians in their area, consequently no steps are there possible. 24. If internal security is to be restored and maintained an immediate reorganisation of the Persian forces and restoration of morale is necessary. A smaller and less pretentious army will suit present needs. It is unlikely that any effective steps towards reorganisation will be taken by the Persian Govern ment until some clear indication is given of the wishes and intentions of the British and Russian Governments. Allied Military Operations. 25. British and Russian troops entered Persian territory on the morning of the 25th August. The Shah ordered his troops to cease resistance on the 28th August and in the next few days the following areas were occupied :— British troops— 10th Division : Khanakin, Kirmanshah, Hamadan, with detachments later at Sanandaj and Sultanabad (Arak). 8 th Indian Division : Khuzestan and the main workings of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company. Russian troops— Army of the Caucasus : Tabriz, Rezaieh, Sauj Bulagh, Zinjan, Kazvin, southern shore of Caspian Sea. Army of Transcaspia: south-eastern shore of Caspian, Semnan, Damghan, Meshed. 26. It has hitherto been impossible to obtain any reliable information of the strength of Russian forces in Persia. Those in the north-west are unreliably reported to be three Infantry Divisions, one horsed Cavalry Division, and one Armoured Division. They are commanded by General Novikoff. In the east the invading troops probably did not amount to a division. They were commanded by General Schlapkin, who is now reported to have returned to Askhabad. 27. Very little resistance was met by either Russian or British troops in their advance. Tabriz was captured by one motorised battalion of Russian troops, and some A.F.V’s. . . • British operations were conducted with impressive speed and efficiency. 28. On the 17th September Russian and British forces (the 9th Armoured Brigade) reached Tehran, but did not enter the city. The Russians have occupied a number of Persian barracks which lie outside the town, evicting the Persian troops at a moment’s notice. The British troops are occupying newly-erected [23—25] B 2buildings intended for a machine-gun factory situated outside the town to the east. The Russians are on the west and north.

Underwood has been appointed assistant military d't tcLclrG * Transit Routes to Russia. 30. Investigations into the capacity of road routes and of the motor trans port available and required have been carried out as regards routes other than the Nok-kundi-Meshed road by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, who have been charged with the operation of these routes under military control. The Nok-kundi-Meshed route is being developed by the Government of India. 31. Lieutenant-Colonel Davis, R.E., who came to Tehran from the British Mission at Moscow, has reported on the capacity of the Persian railways and the available rolling-stock. 32. Negotiations with the Russians regarding the points from which they will operate the transit routes have not yet been completed. 33. frial consignments have already been conveyed by rail from Bandar Shahpur (P.G.) and handed over to the Russians at Zinjan and Kazvin; 200 tons of jute have been sent by the Government of India to Meshed, and a heavy consignment of goods is being despatched by road from railhead at Khanakin. 34. Hitherto, in spite of the confusion prevailing for some days after the invasion, which must have offered many opportunities of sabotage, no damao-e has been done to the very vulnerable railway or to factories or installations. The security of the railway is, however, a matter of some concern. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Ihe company, having heard that there is to be a reduction of our troops in South-West Persia, is concerned about the safety of its workings, particularly those lying at some distance from Abadan. Since the Bakhtiari holdings in the company were taken over by the Persian Government and the Bakhtiari guards abolished, the tribe has no longer an interest in the security of the company’s workings. ^ j British Troops. 36. Although it cannot be said that the military occupation is anything but unpopular, except with those who hope to make money out of the troops, there is no doubt of the sincerity of the welcome given to British troops where Russians are m the neighbourhood. ttussian interests. Russian Troops. 3J- lb e Russian troops have in many respects made a good impression on all except Persians. I heir discipline is strict, the behaviour of the rank and file is good their equipment and physique are excellent, but their turn-out is dirtv and sloven y. Generally, the impression given by the Russian forces is of a rigid and inelastic machine with little initiative left to subordinates. . 38 - rhe actl ons of the Russian forces appear to be directed with a lack andNn^r™,, AS m a r PeS be : the Selection of railwa y stations and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company petrol and oil tanks as bombing targets- the disarming of all police and gendarmerie, combined with a refusal to accept responsibility for the protection of life and property; the stripping of Persian civilian lorries of essential parts required by Russian forces, such Is tyres- the confiscation of property necessary to railway working; interference with civilian he ree tohHsh T °/ These measures must retard the re-estabhshment of Persian administration, which the Russians profess to desire, and handicap the.workmg of the through transit routes 39.

The Roumanian Charge d’Affaires and staff left Tehran for Bucharest on the 17th September via Bagdad. On leaving Tehran they were held up for several hours by Russian troops, but eventually were allowed to proceed. Bulgarian Interests. 52. M.

THE ex-Shah embarked at Bandar Abbas on the steamship Bandra on the 27th September. 2. The following persons embarked with Reza Shah at Bandar Abbas :— The ex-Queen Consort, Princess Shams Pahlevi, Prince Ali Reza Pahlevi, Prince Abdur Reza Pahlevi. Prince Mohamed Reza Pahlevi. Princess Fatimeh Pahlevi, Prince Gholam Reza Pahlevi, Prince Hamid Reza Pahlevi, M. Feraidun Jam. All except the last named are the offspring of Reza Shah. 3 . Since their departure there is a noticeable decrease in the hostility of public opinion towards the new Shah that was noticeable before his accession. 4. The Queen has returned to Tehran from Isfahan. Internal. Persian Affairs. 5. Disorder continues to increase. Highway robbery, and even raids by armed parties on villages, have been reliably reported from different areas. t Especially in Azerbaijan, the situation grows worse. Robbery is rife; the • disarmed Persian police and gendarmerie are incapable of dealing with it; the Russians are not interested. Commerce is dead. Talk of secession continues. Azerbaijan can now hardly be counted a part of Persia. The Turkish Consul is considering evacuating Turkish subjects to Turkey. 6 . Owing to Russian obstructiveness, the usual flow of supplies from the northern provinces southwards has almost ceased. 7. In Tehran there is increasing resentment against the presence of Russian ; troops, and until they are removed some distance from the capital it is unlikely that the Government will be able to achieve effective measures of reform. The situation here is generally deteriorating. There is growing criticism of the present Government, instigated largely, no doubt, by those who would like to be in it. Every kind of intrigue is rife : old out-of-office politicians trying to get back; young would-be politicians trying to oust the old; mullahs striving to l [ 23 — 42 1 R£Cd. POL. DEPr. j 25 AIOV 941 INDIA OFFICE2 'kisJL \ paA l recover their power and prestige; and a host of place-seekers endeavouring to better themselves. The newly-granted liberty of speech has an intoxicating effect: tongues wag hard. 8 . Telegraphic communication, interrupted by the Russians, has now been restored between Tehran and Meshed and Tehran and Tabriz. 9. From Khuzistan the Persian Government has reports of anti-Government and pro-Arab propaganda being carried on among the Persian-Arab tribes. They allege that this propaganda has its sources in Iraq. 10. In Pars the Qashgai are restless. Naser Khan, the son of the notorious Soulat-ed-Douleh. who fled from Tehran, where he was a hostage, during the confusion of the first few days of the invasion, is now at Firuzabad in the Qashgai garmsir. He refuses to come to Tehran unless given a guarantee of life and property by His Majesty’s Legation. With the tribe he is a potential source of trouble. 11 . In the Bushire hinterland the Dashtis and Tangestanis have begun to cause trouble. It will be remembered that it was these people who harboured Wassmuss during the last war and could not be bribed to surrender him. 12 . The situation in Kurdistan is still out of hand. The Kurds say they have British backing, and Persians are inclined to believe it. Persian Officials. 13. The following appointments have been announced :— Minister in London : Saiyid Hasan Taqizadeh (294) (210). Ambassador in Cairo: Mahmud Jam (Minister of the Court to Reza Shah) (130) ( 102 ). Governor of the National Bank : Hussein Ala ( 11 ) (7). Minister of the Court: Muhammad Ali Farzin (91) (69). Chief of the General Staff: Major-General Yazdan Panah (301) (216). Commandant of the Officers’ School : Major-General Zarghami (307) (219). Note. —The first number in brackets against each name refers to Military Attache’s List of Personalities; the second to the Foreign Office List. Persian Army. 14. The situation has not improved. Desertions continue and generally morale is extremely low. Discords and jealousies among the generals do not improve matters. The 1 st and 2 nd Divisions in Tehran are now probably incapable of operating. The officers’ school has temporarily closed down. 15. A number of Persian officers are still held prisoner by the Russians. It is popularly believed that the younger ones, already discontented, are being converted to bolshevism. 16. Considerable quantities of munitions of all kinds were captured or seized by the Russians. None has been returned to the Persian army. Gendarmerie. 17. The reorganisation of the gendarmerie (Amnieh) is now under con sideration by the Persian authorities. An increase of pay is promised. General Zahidi has been appointed head of the force. For some years past the gendarmerie has had no central command, all units being under the command of the military commander in whose area they were situated. A central administra tion should be an improvement. British Interests. British Troops. 18. His Excellency the Commander-in-chief in India and the General Officer Commanding British Forces in Iraq and Persia arrived in Tehran on the 27th September and left on the 30th and 29th respectively. They met General Novikoff, commanding Russian forces in North-West Persia. 19. The 2 nd Armoured Brigade relieved the 9th Armoured Brigade at Tehran on the 27th September.3 Tr) \ CA Russian Affairs. Russian Troops. 20 . The discipline of the Russian troops in the vicinity of Tehran is deteriorating. Many authentic cases have come to notice of persons being “'^'Vaylaid and robbed by armed Russian soldiers and of houses being broken into. 21. The Russian troops continue to make it impossible for the Persian authorities to maintain order. The police and gendarmerie in all the area occupied by Russian troops are still without arms. In one instance a party of gendarmerie in pursuit of highway robbers entered the Russian zone, were disarmed and the robbers allowed to escape. In another, a Persian military patrol sent out to round-up deserters was disarmed by villagers while Russian troops looked on. 22 . It is reported from many sources, although it cannot be accepted as entirely confirmed, that all captured Persian war material of value is being removed to Russia. Much of this material fell into Russian hands after the armistice. 23. Although it may not be possible to convict the Russians of deliberately conducted propaganda, every Russian soldier talking to a Persian peasant is a propagandist and finds in most cases a ready healing. 24. The Russian military authorities have recently issued an order that no one is allowed to enter the Russian occupied zone without a pass signed by a competent Russian authority. This order applies equally to British officers in uniform. 25. The Russians have confiscated all goods in the Tabriz customs-house on the pretext that they are of German origin. The goods are, in fact, mostly the property of Persian merchants who have made at least part-payments for them. They have also confiscated all the cars—about 200—mostly of private ownership, which had been requisitioned by the Persian authorities for the transport of the German and Italian Legations and German women and children to the Turkish frontier. French Interests. 26. The French Legation have been warned unofficially that it is the intention of the Persian, British and Soviet Governments to close down the French Legation here as long as it is occupied by Vichy officials. 27. Captain Florent. of the Free French Headquarters at Beirut, recently visited Tehran on a special mission in connexion with the reorganisation of the Free French here and the dissemination of propaganda. Captain Florent is a Roman Catholic priest and a Russian expert, formerly domiciled in Leningrad and now serving on General Catroux’s staff.

Id*? kx&gt;I‘&amp;€£*% many Greek volunteers wish to join the Greek forces in Egypt. It is hoped that'kjvi* a Greek officer will shortly visit Persia in this connexion. Yugoslav Interests. 29. A Yugoslav officer will shortly visit Tehran in connexion with the enlistment of Yugoslav volunteers. Czechoslovak Interests. 30. The considerable Czechoslovak community in Persia is very much broken up by endless quarrelling and petty intrigues among themselves. A Communist party among the specialists employed by Messrs. Skoda’s has also appeared. The arrival in Tehran of official representatives of the Czechoslovak Government in London is awaited, when harmony will perhaps be more or less restored among the Czechs.4 Communications. 31. Reliable reports from all over Persia state that the road-mender gangs previously maintained by the Ministry of Roads and Communications have not yet recommenced work since the invasion of Persia. Main roads are being badl^Y cut up by heavy military traffic and, if road repair is not carried out forthwith, ~ will result in the serious interruption of traffic, especially during the coming winter months. 32. The immediate solution would seem to be the full payment of arrears to the workmen and the re-engagement of the former labourers and foremen at increased rates of pay under the general supervision of competent engineers, interfering as little as possible with the existing Persian organisation.

Tehran Intelligence Suircnary No. 22. FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. ‘There was a certain reaction in favour of Germany during the first week of October, largely due to Russian policy,which, it was felt,was directed against a firm and united Central Government in Persia, The conduct of the Russian soldiers in the neighbourhood of Tehran appeared to be deteriorating and the Russians were obstructing the transport of foodstuffs from the Provinces occupied by them. The situation in Kurdistan was growing worse &gt; and there './as a danger that unless steps were taken to suppress disorder, it would spread to Lurestan which was reported to be growing increasingly restless. The Russian authorities told the Persian Minister of the Interior that in principle they -£id not oppose the re-establishment of armed and gendarmerie in areas occupied by them, but they seem${to be doing little to encourage it. The Persian officials in the capital appeared to be willing to co-operate with the British. Desertions from the Persian army continued and the General Staff declared that they had no reliable troops to send against the rebellious tribes. The control of the nmnieh has been transferred from the Ministry of War to the Ministry of the Interior. It is possible that,in consequence,the army may be less ready to give {eisentia jSsupport^to the gendarmerie.

Enclosure. frj ( Secret ) ft Intelligence Summary No. 22 for the week ending October 8 . 1941. ’ v The Shah and the Imperial Family. I HIS Majesty’s Minister visited the Shah on the 30th September. \&gt;)a/4* AA ' Although the latter gave assurances of his desire to co-operate in all respects, he showed as regards the military situation little appreciation of realities. He spoke of the Persian army as not having had a chance to show its worth and talked of assisting us with an army of 300,000 to 400,000 men. whose equipment, however, would require, he said, to be completed by the United States. Internal. Persian Affairs. 2. Russian actions in Persia and around Tehran in particular are producing a spirit of defeatism, almost despair, among officials and people. It is generally believed that, although British policy may require a stable Government, a united Persia and internal security, Russian policy is directed towards establishing a Government of their own colour and local autonomy in areas under their control. It is not understood why the British, going to such lengths to assist Russia with munitions, should allow a policy so apparently inimical to their interests. Rumours are circulating among Persians that the Russians are very discontented with the help given by Britain and are meditating a separate peace. 3. One result of this is a cooling in pro-British enthusiasm due to increasing- doubt whether the British can or will protect Persia against Russia and a corresponding reaction in favour of Germany, who is looked upon as a possible saviour from bolshevism. German successes in Southern Russia have encouraged these sentiments and German propaganda by Avoi d of mouth is increasing. 4. The situation in Kurdistan is deteriorating. A small column of Persian troops succeeded in driving the Kurds from Saqqiz, but were counter-attacked and driven out again in some disorder. The Kurdish commander in this area is Mohamed Rashid, said to be from Iraq and to be accompanied by some hundreds of Iraqi Kurds. The Kurds have also occupied Sardasht. A ‘ 5. Unless effective steps, political or military, are taken to check the Kurds there is danger of disorder spreading to Lurestan and to the tribes of the south. In the present state of the Persian Government and army it is unlikely that action taken by them will be effective unless backed by at least the overt moral support of the British. 6 . Reports of robbery with violence, raiding and even murder continue to be received from many parts of the country. British consuls in Tabriz and Meshed report increasing lawlessness. The Lurs are restless; they shot up a Persian column moving from Kermanshah to Khorramabad. The Kakavand (Lurs) have looted villages south of Kermanshah. 7. The Russian authorities have told the Persian Minister of the Interior that in principle they do not oppose the re-establishment of armed police and [23—48] 1 J2 TAx &amp;*jct fjOuLoAJfibuJl 1 )jz K|elkfl 4 cuto. K«^e uv gendarmerie in areas occupied by them. They asked for a detail of numbers and dispositions proposed. This was presented twelve days ago, but nothing has been heard from the Russians. 8 . On the strength of verbal assurances from the Russians the Persian authorities are sending 200 old rifles, whose confiscation will not be serious, for the rearmament of the gendarmerie on the Tehran-Meshed road. 9. The Persian Government presented an identical note to the British and '[ZOAAtU^a . Soviet diplomatic representatives asking for the withdrawal of troops from the capital. The note alleges that there is no justification for their continued presence and stresses the difficulties which it creates for the Government. The Russians regard this note as “ provocation.” 10. In general Persian officials, at least in the capital, show a willing readiness to co-operate with us. 11 . Reference paragraph 10 of Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current). Naser Khan has now come in to Shiraz and it is hoped he will make his peace with the Persian Government. Persian Civil A ppointments. 12. Governor of Pars : Assadollah Shams Molkara (previously Shahab-ed- Dowleh). Persian Forces. 13. Disintegration and demoralisation continue. The Persian General Staff state that now only about 12,000 men remain of the 1st and 2nd (Tehran) Divisions and attached troops, whose former strength was nearly 50,000. These divisions were recruited largely from the northern provinces, particularly Azerbaijan. Nothing can be done to prevent desertions, as once through the Russian picquets the men cannot be pursued. For these desertions the General Staff blame the decrease almost to disappearance of the prestige and authority of the Central Government, which has demoralised every administration. 14. The General Staff say they have now no reliable troops; that to , send troops in their present state against rebellious tribes is merely to present tribesmen with more rifles. They are proposing to organise a special force of volunteers particularly to deal with the Kurdish situation. They wish to initiate a reorganisation with better conditions of service, but say that they are unable to do so until they are given an indication of what will be required and what will be allowed. In present circumstances they are denied their best recruiting areas, which are in Russian hands, and no Persian force, however small, can operate against brigands anywhere near Russian troops. 15. The control and administration of the gendarmerie (amnieh) has now been transferred from the Ministry of War to the Ministry of the Interior. This is a reversion to a previous system, which was abandoned in order to secure close co-operation between the gendarmerie and the army. It is intended that the gendarmerie in the provinces should in the future be under the direct control of the Ministry of the Interior, exercised through Governors and not under command of the military commander. This may result in the army being less ready to give to the gendarmerie that support which is essential. Signs of rivalry are already evident. 16. The prospects of the Government being able to find the funds for the increase of pay promised to the gendarmerie in the current financial year are not very bright. 17. The following military appointments have been announced :—- General Shahbakhti (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 262, Foreign Office No. 151), lately commander of the Khuzestan Division, to be corps commander to command the Lurestan, Kermanshah and Kurdistan Divisions. General Razm Ara, formerly Director of Instruction at the Staff College, to command the 1 st (Tehran) Division. General Ghador to be Assistant Director of the Senior Officers’ School. Brigadier Ali Riazi to be Deputy Chief of the General Staff. This is a serious, thoughtful officer, a graduate of the French Staff College. He was a member of the Anglo-Persian Military Mission of 1920 and was liked and respected by the British officers of the mission. General Moini (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 174, Foreign Office No. 131) to command forces in Isfahan.3 y General Farajollah Aghevli (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 6 , Foreign Office No. 25) to be Director of Recruiting. Colonel Hussein Atapur to be Assistant Director of Transport. 1 British Interests. British Troops. 18. The General Officer Commanding, 10 th Indian Division, and a small mechanised column visited Isfahan during the week and were generally well received. Hopes raised by their arrival were dashed by their departure. 19. The 6 th Indian Division is now in process of relieving the 8 th and 10 th Indian Divisions in Persia. Communications—A ir. 20. A survey flight from Cairo arrived in Tehran on the 5th October, con sisting of a representative of B.O.A.C. and several R.A.F. officers, in connexion with the proposed weekly service from Cairo to Tehran, with possible extensions to Baku and Moscow and via Shiraz and Jask to Karachi. It has been suggested that when negotiations are opened with the Persian Government for the operation of this service they should be invited to re-establish the service previously operated by them between Tehran and Bagdad. 21. Of the aerodromes available at Tehran the experts of the survey flight decided that Qila Murgha was the most suitable for development, in spite of the best workshops being at Doshantappeh. Qila Murgha will require runways, as after rain the surface becomes impossible for heavy aircraft. As ram is due now, the matter is urgent. Funds will have to be provided and the work done by the British. Transit Routes—Road and Rail—to Russia. 22 . A considerable amount of preliminary investigation has been made into the capacity of rail and roads, and plans for the maintenance of roads and opera tion of mechanical transport are well advanced. Satisfactory arrangements have not yet been made with the Russians regarding the points at which consigmnents are to be handed over to them. 23. The roads to be used are— (i) Nok-kundi-Zahidan-Meshed. (ii) Khanakin-Kazvin. 9 (iii) From a railhead at Andijrneshk-Khorramabad-Hamadan-Kazvin. (iv) Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan^Tehran, if required.(fl* tas 6 24. Reference paragraph 24 of Summary No. 21 (current). The Russians have now agreed that passes- will not be required by British officers going from Tehran to Kazvin and Zinjan, or from Tehran to Chalus via Karaj. For all other journeys requests for permits will have to be made by His Majesty's Legation to the Soviet Embassy. Propaganda. 25. British propaganda is arousing much greater interest in Persia. It suffers, however, from one grave handicap. References to the objects for which the war is being fought—democracy, freedom, liberty, the security of the smaller nations—have a cynical sound in Persian ears. dittcJtf kaS 11 i l H.OO. Z k&lt;Uv* flsfi. (HaJ 2 A 4 . tvif MfmA ewf 1 - 1 Russian Interests. Military Operations. 26. Two columns, each of about twenty armoured vehicles and twenty lorries, left Tehran on the night of the 6 th in the direction of Meshed. 27. A party of four Russian officers and three men, all armed, from Meshed, visited Birjand and Zahidan during the week. Their journey caused some con sternation. The Persian commander at Birjand expected that they would 1 demand the surrender of the arms of the garrison and asked Tehran for orders. 28. It is reliably reported that the Russians are constructing defences along the Turkish border in Azerbaijan. 29. The Persian Minister of Ways and Communications, returning to his home outside Tehran one evening, was waylaid by Russian soldiers and he, his wife and driver robbed of valuables. This and several other robberies by Russianx troops have caused considerable anxiety and have greatly increased the bitterness of the resentment against the presence of troops. 30. Kelying on the verbal assurances of the Soviet Embassy, the Persian authorities sent a small detachment of gendarmes to Kerej for the purpose of arresting deserters running away by the Tehran-Kazvin road. On arrival at.^ Kerej the detachment was disarmed by Russian troops and sent back to Tehran. 31. Even unarmed gendarmerie posts in villages in the vicinity of Tehran have been evicted by the Russians and told not to return. Russian Policy. 32. Reference paragraph 25 of Summary No. 21 (current). The Russians have now released the motor transport that was used to convey Germans and Italians to the Turkish border. 33. His Majesty's Consul at Tabriz reports that the Russians are seizing goods wholly paid for by Persian importers and exporting them to Russia. Furniture from schools and Government offices is also being confiscated, and 1 there is reason to believe that this also is being taken to Russia. 34. The Soviet Embassy professes to regard as provocation the protests made by the Persian Government about the various incidents reported in this and previous summaries. 35. The transport of food-stufis from the occupied provinces is still being obstructed by the Russians. The shortage of rice and charcoal, in particular, is being felt in the capital. 36. The Military Governor of Tehran states that the Russian Military iUtache, after impressing on him the need for secrecy, told him that it would be very much to his advantage if he would watch and report on British activities, of I which the Russians were very suspicious. It is probable that there is at least ; a basis of truth in this statement. 37. The Persian Minister for War, General Ahmed NaJkhchevan, states that he was approached by a well-known Persian Communist in close touch with the Russians with the suggestion that he should lead a revolution against the present regime and become President of the Republic. He could count on Russian support. There may be truth in this statement Czech Interests. 38. Messrs. Skodas (Iran) (Limited), who were under the direction of Herr Goring (one of the brothers of Field-Marshal Goring) at Prague, have entirely severed their connexion with the protectorate and reorganised the firm in Persia under the name of Societe Anonyme Iranienne Skoda. A neutral director ? has been appointed (Captain Marius Jouvel, formerly Assistant French Military Attache, and now one of the Free French Committee in Tehran) who replaces the German director, Count Mensdorf Pouilly. French Interests. 39. The French Military Attache, Commandant Alessandri, has handed back the wireless transmitter-receiver which he took over from the Polish Secret Service in 1939. 40. The French Military Attache’s staff has now been dismissed and preparations are being made for the transfer of documents to the Ministry of War at Vichy or their local destruction. Commandant Alessandri has handed 11 over to the British Legation his files and card index on Germans in Persia. M 41. Reference paragraph 27 of Intelligence Summary No. 21 (current). Captain Florent left for Beirut by car accompanied by the following French subjects, who are joining the Free French movement:— Lieutenant de Melcharski, former French Air Force officer. Sergeant Becher, wireless operator attached to French Military Attache’s office. M. Laporte, French Intelligence Service; an expert on the Caucasus.

Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 23 for the Week ending October 15, 1941. Persian Affairs. Internal. A PROPOSED law has been laid before the Majlis for an increase of pay of all officials, civil and military. The increase for civil employees ranges from 100 per cent, in the lower grades to 50 per cent, in the upper grades. The increase of pay for the army is dealt with in a later paragraph. 2 . The internal situation is still deteriorating. His Majesty’s Consul- General at Meshed reports that the roads and country-side around Meshed are quite unsafe. Motor traffic on the roads north and south of Isfahan has been held up and goods robbed. Numerous robberies have occurred around Shiraz and villages have been looted. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire reports disturbances in Dashti and Tangistan. Lur tribes continue to loot villages south of Kermanshah. 3. In Kurdistan there is no improvement. The Kurds are threatening Diwati Darra and talk of attacking Senna. They repeatedly assert that they are ready to obey any orders given them by British authorities, and it is urgently necessary that they should be made clearly to understand that rebellion against the Persian Government is not viewed with favour. 4. Reference paragraph 11 of Summary No. 22 (current). Naser Khan has returned to his tribe and is again asking for British guarantees as a condition of surrendering himself to the Persian authorities. 5. In Mazanderan mobs looted Government offices in the capital of the province. Russian troops assisted in restoring order, and the provincial capital is now quiet. There are some armed bands of brigands in the hills. There is a strong spirit of bolshevism among the peasants, but competent observers state that they have no reason to attribute this to deliberate Russian propaganda. A Persian Government Commission has been sent to Mazanderan to take over the late Shah’s properties, which cover practically the whole province. 6 . The head of the secret police and several senior officials of this much- hated organisation have been arrested and are being sent for trial. 7. Misbah Fatimi (Military Attache’s Personalities No. 171) has been appointed Governor of Khuzestan. 8 . Except as regards sugar the position regarding supplies has improved generally, if slightly, throughout the country. The recent substantial increase in the price of wheat has brought more on to the market, but the resulting increase in the price of bread has caused considerable discontent. A reduction in the price [23—61] RECd. POL. DEPt, 10 DEC 941 INDIA OFFICE2 of bread is unlikely, as it is based not so much on the increased price of local wheat as on the price being paid by the Persian Government for wheat imported from India. 9. The shortage of sugar is real, although it may be aggravated by hoarding. It is due largely to large quantities of sugar bought in the Dutch East Indies having failed to reach Persia. 4* Persian Forces. 10. The Persian War Office has been informed that the entire responsibility for the preservation of law and order and security of communications, as far as British authorities are concerned, lies with the Persian Government; and that the strength and dispositions of the forces necessary for this purpose is a matter for them to decide generally, subject, in the case of areas where British troops are concerned, to the agreement of the British Commander. 11. The Persian Government have decided to maintain the system of con scription as a long-term policy, but to organise forces of volunteers as a temporary measure to arrest the stream of desertions and to deal with existing disorder. 12. As regards the areas with which British troops are directly concerned, the Persian General Staff propose the following distribution : — In Kurdistan.—Headquarters at Sanandaj (Senna)— 3 Regiments Infantry (of three battalions each). 1 Regiment Cavalry. 3 Mountain Batteries (four guns each). In the Kermanshah area.—Headquarters at Kermanshah— 2 Regiments Infantry. 1 Regiment Cavalry. 2 Batteries 105-mm. Skoda Short. In Luristan.—Headquarters at Khorramabad— As for Kermanshah. In Khuzestan.—Headquarters at Ahwaz— 1 Regiment Infantry. 1 Regiment Cavalry. The General Staff will try to find a Mountain Battery for Khuzestan, but they are very short of mountain guns, having lost half to the Russian or British troops. 13. A Bill is now before the Assembly for an increase of pay to all ranks of the army. Typical examples are : — Divisional General from 4,000 rials to 6,000 rials. Lieut.-Colonel from 1,500 rials to 2,800 rials. Captain from 900 rials to 1,700 rials. 2nd Lieutenant from 500 rials to 1,050 rials. Sergeant from 90 rials to 450 rials. Private from 7-50 rials to 10 rials (plus clothing and rations). The pay of officers is still inadequate, having regard to the cost of living, as is the pay of private soldiers with families, but the increase should effect an improvement. It remains to be seen whether the necessary funds will be provided. Military Appointments. 14. Brigadier Saifollah Shehab to be Director of the 1st Bureau, General Staff. This officer served in the South Persia Rifles, has graduated at the Lrench Staff College, is pro-British and an officer of some ability. Colonel Hussein Arta to be assistant in the Inspectorate of the Ministry of War. British Affairs. Military. 15. A Planning Committee from Cairo, consisting of military and air force officers, was in Tehran on the 9th and 10th October.16. The British and Russian Governments have agreed in principle to the withdrawal of troops from Tehran, and the Persian Government have been so informed. The date has not yet been fixed. 17. The General Officers Commanding 6 th and 10 th Indian Divisions were ^^in Tehran on the 11 th October. They met General NovikofT, and the General ^™Officer Commanding 6 th Division met the Persian Minister for War and the Persian Chief of the General Staff. 18. Headquarters of the 6 th Indian Division is now established at Arak (Sultanabad). The 24th Infantry Brigade of this division is in Khuzestan; the 27th to be on the line Khanakin-Hamadan-Arak. General. 19. Brigadier Rhodes, Director of Transportation in Persia, has arrived in Tehran. 20. Lieutenant King, a technical radio engineer, has arrived in Tehran to assist with the technical supervision of the Tehran wireless station. 21. Negotiations for the Anglo-Russo-Persian Treaty* have not yet begun, the Soviet Ambassador not having had his instructions. German successes in Russia have made the atmosphere for these negotiations less favourable. Russian Affairs. Military. 22. There has been a noticeable improvement in the discipline of Russian troops around Tehran. No fresh robberies have been reported. From Mazan- deran and Meshed come reliable reports that in those places the behaviour of Russian troops is unexceptionable. 23. General Novikoff, commanding Russian forces in North-West Persia, has received orders to prepare to withdraw from Tehran at short notice. He has not yet received orders regarding future locations. 24. The Russian cavalry at Tehran gave an equestrian display to the people of Tehran. Persians did not attend in large numbers. 25. Major Mgvdeladze, representing the Soviet Transport Directorate, has arrived in Tehran and has met Brigadier Rhodes. 26. Russian officers have been inspecting Persian military arsenals and factories. 27. Lieut.-General Lvov has relieved Lieut.-General Kazlov as Commander in-Chief in the Caucasus. General. 28. The officials of the Soviet Embassy have been noticeably more accessible during the past week and seem less suspicious. 29. The Russian Ambassador has not yet received instructions to begin negotiations for the Anglo-Russian-Persian Treaty. 30. Generally, Russian officials are adopting a more conciliatory and less unhelpful attitude towards Persia. Persians are inclined to attribute this to the seriousness of the military situation in Russia. 31. Reference paragraph 22 of Summary No. 22 (current). It has now been accepted by the Russians that goods in transit to Russia by lorry should be run right through to the Caspian instead of being transferred to Russian- controlled transport at some intermediate point. 32 The Russians have announced that civilian traffic is now allowed with out passes between Tehran and Tabriz, Meshed, Resht. Transport is consequently beginning to circulate. Turkish Affairs. 33 The Persian press announces that Jamal Husni Tarai has been appointed Turkish Ambassador to Persia, and adds that he has already been in Persia a few years ago to negotiate the treaty between Persia and Turkey.

Enclosure. Intelligence Summary No. 24 for the W eek ending October 22, 1941. Persian A ffairs. The Government. THE withdrawal of British and Russian troops from Tehran has been greeted with almost universal relief on the part of the Persian Government and people, though the former may have some regret that they can no longer plead the strangling effect of the £ ‘ occupation ” as an excuse for inaction. Credit for the withdrawal is largely given to the Germans for their successes in South Russia. 2. Dissatisfaction with the present Government, however much its pro gramme of reforms is approved, is growing, and, in spite of the respect and liking he undoubtedly enjoys, there is much criticism of the Prime Minister as being too weak and lacking in energy to handle the present very difficult situation. There are many candidates for the post, but none seems to command any considerable following. There appear to be fairly strong parties of the more progressive elements in favour of Taqizadeh (Personalities, Foreign Office. No. 210; Military Attache’s, No. 294), who is now in London, and Seyyid Zia (Personalities, Foreign Office, No. 206; Military Attache’s, No. 286), who is now in Palestine. 3. The task of the Government is by no means easy. The sudden collapse of the despotic and highly centralised administration of Shah Reza and of the prestige of the armed forces and the disintegration of the latter have resulted in lawlessness throughout the country and indiscipline in all administrations. Officials of the old regime, knowing that reforms may bring their dismissal, are picking up what they can. On the other hand, suitable replacements are hard to find. The course of the last twenty years has given no scope to officials who combined energy with a measure of honesty and regard for constitutional practice. Moreover, the Government is faced with a shortage of food-stuffs, a deficit in the budget and the urgent need to raise salaries to a figure having closer relation to the high cost of living. 4. The deficit in the budget is due to under-estimation of expenditure and over-estimation of revenue, which will be aggravated by the loss of revenue arising out of the present disorders. Nothing is at present coming in from the north, which normally provides a disproportionately large share. 5 . The new Shah is now being regarded with much less disfavour and may almost be said to be making a good impression. Internal Situation. • 6 . The internal situation continues to be very disturbed. During the week robberies have occurred on the roads and in villages around Shiraz. Bushire [23—62] RECn.POL.DCPr. IQ DEC 941 INDIA OFFICE2 town is affected by the disturbances in the countryside and robberies have occurred in the streets. Small armed bands are reported to be operating in the Behbehan area. . „. 7. In the vicinity of Meshed the situation has improved slightly, but Mrs Majesty’s Consul-General describes conditions in the country as chaotic, especially in Kuchan. The Russian commander has agreed to the rearmament of police and gendarmerie, but refuses to hand back any of the rifles which he has captured or confiscated or collects from villagers. The Persian authorities have no confidence that a new issue of arms will not be confiscated on some pretext, as has happened in other places. They are, however, sending a more energetic officei to command the gendarmerie with orders to re-establish posts on the road Meshed-Zahidan. 8 . His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman reports all quiet in that area. Additional gendarmerie have been sent to the disturbed parts of the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road where robberies had occurred recently. 9 . His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz reports that there is improvement in the town but still disorder in the province. In some parts Government s admimstia- tion has disappeared, notably south and south-east of Lake Urmia. There are no police or gendarmerie in Rezaieh or Western Azerbaijan. 10. From Kurdistan there is little reliable information. The 6 th Indian Division report that a force of about 500 Kurds advanced to within 10 miles of Senna, but that otherwise there seems to be little change in this area. Further north, Sauj Bulagh is under the administration of a Kurdish notable, not ill-disposed to the Persian Government, who has organised his own police force and is in some degree keeping in check the wilder elements who are pillaging the countryside along the Turkish and Iraqi borders. The Rowanduz road is now reported to be unsafe. The situation at Sardasht is obscure; an unconfiimed report says it is now in the hands of the Kurds. 11.

There is reason to believe that the spread of demoralisation has been checked and that the number of desertions have been greatly reduced. This is due in part to the announcement of an increase of pay, and in part to evidence of an intention to effect reform of the worst abuses. Proclamations have been made calling up conscripts due for service this year and threatening punishment to all those absent without permission who have not reported by the 1 st November. The northern provinces still remain, however, a sanctuary for deserters and closed to the recruiting authorities. 13. A law which gave to Reza Shah personally, when he was Minister for War, the absolute command of the forces subject to cancellation by the Majlis only has now been abrogated. By the Constitution the reigning Shah is Commander-in-chief of the forces. 14. The Persian Staff College reopens on the 23rd October. 15. Military Appointments — General Mirjalali to be commander of mechanised forces. Colonel Ghulam Ali Ansari to be general and to be Director of Adminis tration of Artillery. Colonel Atapur. C.B.E., to be a brigade commander in Khuzestan. Colonel Kaivan to be Military Governor of Kermanshah. Gendarmerie — Colonel Khadivi to be Commander of the Gendarmerie in Khuzestan.3 16. The trend of recent military appointments has been to introduce a better educated and less corrupt type of officer. These, if not always pro-German, are greatly impressed by Germany’s military efficiency, and, having some degree of patriotism, are resentful of the Anglo-Russian occupation. On the other hand. ^ most of them have the sense to see that in present circumstances it is best to co-operate with the British. Russian Affairs. 17. Reports from all provinces occupied by the Russians show that, on the whole, the behaviour of officials and troops is correct but quite unhelpful to the Persian authorities, so much so that some observers got the impression that the Russian authorities were deliberately allowing the Persian Administration to fall to pieces with a view to justifying them in putting in their own and eventually annexing the provinces. 18. They have informed the Persian Government that they have no objec tion to the rearming of police and gendarmerie, but they refuse to return any of the rifles they have captured or confiscated. 19. There is still no evidence that the Russians are carrying on any deliberately organised propaganda, but in the villages of Azerbaijan films are shown of which the plot is nearly always the success of the peasant revolt in Russia against cruel and greedy landlords. The Azerbaijani peasant needs little incentive to rouse him against his own landlords. 20 . All construction work on roads, railways and buildings has been stopped in the Russian area. Very little maintenance is being done on roads, and several observers have noted that road and railway bridges are unguarded. Russian Troops. 21. All Russian troops had withdrawn from Tehran by the 18th October. They are to occupy, in addition to Azerbaijan, Kasvin. Resht, the southern shore of the Caspian and Meshed. General Novikoff has moved his headquarters to Tabriz. 22. It is reliably reported that some Russian troops have been withdrawn from Persia to the Caucasus; one unconfirmed report says in considerable numbers. 23. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed estimates Russian troops there to be about 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. A viation. 24. Russian aircraft as under have recently been observed :— At Meshed : 50 aircraft. At Kasvin : 40-50 aircraft, mostly single-seaters. At Pahlevi : 18 single-seater fighters. Landing Grounds. 25. At Kasvin the landing ground south of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company depot is being improved. South of Resht along the Astara Road a new aerodrome is being constructed. British Affairs. 26. The text of the proposed treaty of alliance with Persia has now been presented to the Persian Government by the British Minister and the Soviet Ambassador. The Persian reaction is likely to be that they do not improve their present situation, but do put themselves in the very unpleasant position of being a declared enemy of Germany. ^ , 27. The 2nd Armoured Brigade withdrew from Tehran on the 18th October. American Affairs. 28. Captain J. G.

Persian Affairs U3 o/vU**,. THE Shah broadcast to the Persian people on the 25th. He appealed for unity, for faith in God, for the self-sacrifice that was the price of freedom. He reiterated his faith in democracy and in the necessity for maintaining high moral and spiritual standards as the basis of progress. 2 . The Shah’s birthday was celebrated on the 26th October without marked enthusiasm on the part of the people, although at the evening reception in the palace he and the Queen were greeted with some warmth. 3. The terms of the treaty are now being considered by a committee of Ministers. The Cabinet will have some difficulty in making it palatable to Parliament, whose approval is essential under the Constitution. The Prime Minister has begun to try and persuade leading members of Parliament that the pill has some gilding. 4. Notices have been published in the press by the Military Governor of Tehran calling attention to two existing laws which forbid criticism of the Government by the press and the holding of meetings without permission. The announcement is coupled with a warning that the laws will be enforced. There are some who profess to see in this an intention to continue the suppression of democratic liberty. There are others, however, who realise that, having regard to the irresponsibility of public opinion, such restrictions are necessary. Internal Situation. 5. The internal situation shows slight improvement in some areas, deteriora tion in others. Genuine endeavours are being made to restore order in the face of considerable difficulty. The gendarmerie is being rearmed and re-established, a number of officers having been transferred from the army to gendarmerie commands. Rearmament should now proceed at a faster pace', as trial consign ments of arms sent to the Russian-occupied areas have been allowed to be distributed. But in many places, owing to desertions, new enlistments have to be made before the gendarmerie can be re-established. 6 . Ears continues to be disturbed. Robberies have occurred on the Bushire- Shiraz road; seven Anglo-Iranian Oil Company lorries were held up by armed men near Khaneh Ziman, the drivers robbed and forced to return to Shiraz. In the Bushire hinterland the activities of Dashti tribesmen are increasing, and, according to unconfirmed reports, they are now in control of the greater part of the Tanqistan coastal belt. There are rumours that the leaders are in contact with Naser Qashgai. This would not be the first time the tribes of Dashti had been associated with the family of Naser Qashgai. Reinforcements of troops have been sent to Tanqistan. [24—25] RECd. POL. D£P t . 1 6 41 INDIA OFFICE2 7. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports improvement in the local situation. Gendarmerie posts are being re-established. 8 . His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz also reports a slight improvement. The rearming of police and gendarmerie has begun. ^ 9. In Kurdistan the situation has not greatly changed except that there has been less aggressiveness on the part of the Kurds. Abbas Kalhur, Amir-i- Makhsus, formerly recognised as chief of the Kalhur (Personalities, Foreign Office, Military Attache’s, No. 139), who has spent recent years in prison in Tehran and who has some influence with Kurdish tribes other than his own, has been sent to assist General Shahhakhti (see Summary of Intelligence No. 22 , paragraph 17) in his negotiations with the Kurds. These negotiations will probably take the traditional Persian form of sowing dissensions among the tribes and of promising blessings to some to induce them to take the side of Government against others. 10. In the Kermanshah area, in Luristan and the adjacent districts, although there is no serious tribal movement, there is much brigandage. Rather serious bread riots occurred in the town of Kermanshah on the morning of the 27th October. Civil Appointments. 11 . Chief of Finance Department, Azerbaijan : Furuzan (formerly chief, Tehran Municipality). Governor of Khorramshahr : Hasan Matin (formerly Governor of Qum). Deputy Governor of ( 6 th Ustandari) : Nasrullah Vasig Kija. Chief of Police, Resht: Colonel Bihzad. Chief of Police, Isfahan : Colonel Mukhtari (not the previous chief of Tehran Police). Chief of Police, Tabriz : Sarhang Saif. Persian Consul in Bombay : Abulqhassem Panahi. Persian Army. 12. The Cabinet has referred the drait of the treaty to a War Office Committee consisting of :— The Minister for War : General Ahmed Nakchevan (Personality, F.O. 144/M.A. 193). The Chief of the General Staff : General Yazdan Panah (Personality, F.O. 212 /M.A. 301). Head of the First Bureau : Brigadier Seifullah Shihab (see Intelligence Summary No. 23, paragraph 41). Head of the Second Bureau : Brigadier Riazi (see Intelligence Summary No. 22 , paragraph 17). Commander of the Gendarmerie : General Zahidi. The reactions of this committee, as reported by General Shihab in a visit to His Majesty’s Minister, ostensibly private but very probably inspired by the Shah, are that Persia is being asked to submit to a great deal—'Censorship, British control of communications, British use of Persian material, &amp;c., and to declare herself a belligerent against the Axis. But to them the treaty did not read as if Persia was being treated as an ally with her part to play in the war. They felt that the treaty should allot a more glorious role to the Persian army associated with us. They saw no reason to limit the operations of the Persian army to Persian soil. They could raise an army of twelve divisions if we could provide the equipment. His Majesty’s Minister indicated the very serious problem they had to face in the restoration of internal security and the small progress hitherto made in its solution. They had plenty to do for the present in reorganising an army for that purpose. They should disabuse their minds of any idea of getting modern armament, but the provision of equipment essential for the services required for internal security operations, of which the Persian army is seriously deficient, would be considered. Comment. —It is improbable that the proposal that we should equip a Persian expeditionary force was regarded seriously by the General Staff, who are nots' 3 ignorant of the position as regards shipping and the supply of material to our own forces. It was probably dictated by the Shah from motives of vanity and a desire to see the prestige of his army re-established. 13. The Persian General Staff report that they have lost about 85,000 rifles, L^aptured or confiscated by British and Russian forces and disposed of by deserting iroops. A considerable number of these must have fallen into the hands of tribes and brigands. 14. The Persian General Staff has submitted to the Shah the names of some twenty senior officers for compulsory retirement. British Army. 15. Headquarters of the 6 th Indian Division has moved from Arak to Kermanshah. Russian Troops. 16. There has been a definite withdrawal of Russian troops from Persia to the Caucasus, but reliable information as to the extent of this withdrawal is not yet available. 17. All Russian aircraft have been withdrawn from Kasvin. Tehran, October 29, 1941.EXTEB1TA1 NOTES FOR REGISTRY. '— \?Vo—' J^v '-K Political Department. SECRET REGISTER NO. Ext. 8360/41. Ext. 8404/41.

The Treaty, still unsigned, was very unpopular, and anti-British sentiment was growing. This was due partly to German propaganda, partly to dislihe of the Russians, and partly to the fact that the high prices, food shortage and general disorder were all blamed on the British. Sugar was rationed in several towns, and the price of tobacco, a Government monopoly, had been raised. 7/heat was still short and prices high, and owing to the disturbed condition of the countryside autumn sov/ings were being neglected. There was a slight improvement in internal security during the period, though some robberies and hold-ups on the roads were reported. Disturbances still continued in Pars, and the ?, Kurdish problem” remained unsolved. The B.o.A.C. had inaugurated a weekly service between Cairo and Tehran.

Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the Period October 30 to November IO-^mJc'I 0 —- ^ (Secret.) i Persian A ffairs. ^ | o Political. 63 THE draft treaty has engaged the attention of all political circles. It has been studied by a commission of leaders of parties in the Parliament, where it created no small dismay and was severely criticised. In spite of this, the Prime Minister considers that he has secured the agreement of party leaders in principle. Certain suggested amendments have now been presented by the Cabinet to the British and Russian diplomatic representatives. 2. The 12 th session of the Parliament closed on the 30th October. The 13th session will be opened by the Shah on the 13th November. Commenting on the record of the 12 th session, the press says that, except for the last few weeks of its life, it was nothing more than an institution for the registration of the decrees of the Shah, often against its will and always without criticism. 3. Fairly reliable information from more than one source says that pro-German sentiments are spreading among the common people. These arise from dislike of the Russians, disappointment that British intervention in Persia has not brought an improvement in conditions, the belief that things can’t be much worse and that the arrival of the Germans may make them better. Pro-German word-of-mouth propaganda is said to reach the villages, while British propaganda does not. On the other hand, since the British are blamed for shortage of food, high prices and the prevailing disorder, and are consequently increasingly unpopular, pro-German propaganda has a favourable atmosphere in which to work. Economic. 4. Sugar has been rationed in Tehran and certain other towns of Persia. The price has been raised by 1 rial per kilogramme of soft sugar, and 1 J rials per kilogramme of loaf sugar. 5 . The price of tobacco, which is a Government monopoly, has been raised. 6 . The Persian press has recently published articles calling attention to the necessity for the revival of agriculture. They point out that in recent years there has been an over-concentration of industrialisation and urbanism to the detriment of the peasant and the life of the countryside. It is rather on the latter that the economy of the country should be based. 7. A serious result of the insecurity of the countryside and of disorder in the administration is that peasants are neglecting the autumn sowings which are now due. This is particularly in Mazanderan and the Kermanshah area. 8 . The Budget Commission of the Majlis has approved the Railway Construction Budget, amounting to 805 million rials. Construction of the lines Zinjan-Tabriz, Nishapur-Meshed and Kashan-Yazd is to continue. [24—52] ; ^£Cd. POL. r * 9 5 i)£C 941 INDIA OFFICE2 Officials. 9. The Minister of the Interior is now on tour in Azerbaijan with the mission of accelerating the re-establishment of the civil administration and of the police and gendarmerie. I 10. The chief of the gendarmerie has recently toured to Isfahan, Shira^ and Bushire to investigate security arrangements on that road. 11 . Mahmoud Jam, Persian Minister-Designate to Egypt, left Tehran for Cairo on the 6 th November. Civil Appointments. 12 . Mushfiq Kazerni to be counsellor to the Persian Legation in Egypt. Issa Soroush to be Governor of Yazd. Internal Security. 13. In Kurdistan the situation has not greatly changed. The Kurds still remain in undisputed possession of tracts of country from Lake Urmia, and perhaps further northwards, to Senna, They have made no offensive move against the latfer place, which is garrisoned by British forces. There is as yet no indication that the Kurds are prepared to submit to the complete re-establishment of Persian authority or that the Persian Government is likely to be able for some time to come to impose its authority by force. The commander of the local Persian forces is supposed to be initiating negotiations with the Kurds. These negotiations are likely to have the nature of intrigues playing on inter-tribal jealousies and on the lack of cohesion among the tribes. They may lead to a temporary settlement, but, as Kurdish unrest goes deeper than discontent with Persian administration, the Kurdish problem is likely to remain a problem. 14. Even the small extent to which the rearming of the police and gendarmerie has been effected has improved the situation in the neighbourhood of Meshed. Some arms of deserters have been collected from the countryside by Persian authorities, and, since the Russians have not confiscated the arms recently issued to the gendarmerie, more arms will be sent from Tehran. 15. In Ears disturbances still continue. Seven Persian soldiers were killed in a fight with Qashqai robbers, and further hold-ups have occurred on the Bushire-Shiraz road. The local Persian military authorities claim to have arrested fifty road robbers. There are as yet no grounds for thinking that these disturbances have any political significance. The situation, however, has possibilities, as the Qashqai tribe appear to be rallying round Maser Khan (see Summary No. 22 , paragraph 11). who is now back in tribal country, where he is said to have been visited by most of the head-men of sub-tribes. Persian A rmy. 16. It does not appear that much progress has been made with the raising of voluntary forces as a temporary measure to deal with existing disorders. Uncertainty about the future still creates a lack of confidence in all ranks. Strong rumours have been in circulation that Persian troops are to be taken to Russia to fight the Germans. Military Appointments. 17. Brigadier Kerim Hidayet (108) to be Director of Medical Services, vice Major-General Atabai, transferred to the Ministry of Public Health. Brigadier Hidayet, Director of the 3rd Bureau, General Staff, to be Director of the Staff 'College in addition, vice General Zarqhami, retired. Retirements.

Among the retired generals are two of the most famous, or notorious, lieutenants of the ex-Shah—Karim Buzurjmehri and Khodayar. Corrigendum. Reference paragraph 15 of Summary No. 24. Colonel Khadiri was appointed to command the gendarmerie of Khorassan, not Khuzestan. British Affairs. 18. The British Overseas Airways Corporation has inaugurated a weekly service between Cairo and Tehran. E^lanes will reach Tehran on Mondays and leave on Wednesdays. It is hoped that the Soviet Government will establish a connecting service between Tehran and Russia. 19. Mr. Harrison, of the Eastern Supply Board, has arrived in Tehran to investigate the possibilities of arms and munition factories in Persia. Russian A ffairs. 20. The Soviet Embassy has published a denial of the rumours current for some time that Soviet troops were evacuating Persia. It is, however, common knowledge that garrisons in certain towns have been greatly reduced and that some troops have returned to the Caucasus. His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz reports that fresh troops have moved into Persia from the Caucasus. Turkish Affairs. 21. Articles recently published in the Turkish press have attacked Persia «e r.t. x for oppressing and neglecting so-called Turkish minorities and endeavouring to suppress the Turki language. This has caused some resentment. The Persian press has replied that there are no Turkish minorities in Persia, although there are some Turki-speaking Persians. The principal Turki-speaking peoples of Persia are the Qashqai tribes of Pars, the Turkoman tribes of North-East Persia, and a number of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan. None of these have any particular attachment to Turkey. The j last-named have provided many of Persia’s best servants and most ardent j nationalists. While Turki is not taught in Persian schools, no measures have been taken to suppress its use. Yugoslav Interests. 22. Colonel Bankovitch, the special representative of the Yugoslav General Staff in Egypt, has been successful in obtaining about seventy Yugoslavs of military age for service with the Yugoslav military forces in the Middle East, These men will be proceeding to Egypt at an early date. About sixty others of military age, mainly Croats, have refused to serve in any way and in consequence have had their Yugoslav passports annulled. Arrangements are being made for these men, who are mostly of the skilled labouring class, to be deported from Persia to detention camps either within the British Empire or in the U.S.S.R.German Interests. 23. A party of about sixty-five German women and children whose menfolk are now in detention camps are being repatriated to Germany at their own request. They are to travel via Khanakin-Bagdad and Nisibin and Angora. 24. The investigation and deportation of undesirables and suspected German agents of all nationalities is still proceeding regularly. It is hoped to tackle the^ important problem of Persian pro-German elements as soon as the treaty of alliance has been concluded. Bulgarian Interests. 25. Free Bulgarians in Persia have formed an unofficial committee under the leadership of Dr. Chirokoff. A number of Bulgarians whose pro-Axis sympathies have been proved have been removed for internment. Italian Interests. 26. About eighty to ninety Italian labourers, masons and road-builders still remain in Persia with their wives and families. As they are now unemployed and have no money, they appealed to the Japanese Legation, who are in charge of Italian interests, for assistance in obtaining work. The Japanese will do nothing for them and they have now appealed to the Apostolic Delegate in Persia. These men are capable of doing useful work.

Persian Affairs. (Secret.) THE Shah opened the new session of the Majlis on the 13th November. In his speech he said that events demanded that they should maintain good relations with friendly countries, and particularly that they should collaborate closely with those whose interests were bound up with their own. 2 . Certain interests were hard at work for the week previous to the opening of Parliament in endeavours to work up a demonstration against the Parliament and against the Anglo-Russian-Persian Treaty. This was frustrated by the police, but a section of the crowd on the Shah’s return to his palace mobbed his car with shouts of “ Long live Hitler! ” and “ Down with the Russians and British ! ” There is a certain amount of popular objection to the Deputies of the new Parliament on the grounds that the “elections ” took place under the old regime, and that consequently the Deputies are not representatives of the people, but nominees of the late Shah. 3. The treaty still remains unsigned. The Government would have resigned rather than sign it in its original form, and it is extremely improbable that any other Government could have been found to take office in those conditions. Certain modifications in the text are now under negotiation. Effective denuncia tions by the Berlin radio of the treaty and the Persian Government have increased agitation against it and stiffened opposition. It is unquestionably very unpopular. 4. If there has not been, on the whole, an improvement in security, there have been fewer reports of disturbances and brigandage. But shortage of wheat j and sugar and high prices remain a cause of great discontent, 5. Conditions on the Bushire-Shiraz road looked like improving when a rather serious robbery occurred near Kazarun, a party of engineers and contractors investigating the road being held up and deprived of nearly every thing removable, including their clothes. Various reports have been received about the situation in Fars and the attitude of Naser Khan (see Intelligence Summary No. 26 , paragraph 15) and the Qashgai. Generally, they are to the effect that Naser Khan is, as was previously reported, giving no encouragement to lawlessness and that the tribe, as a whole, shows at present little disposition to take advantage of the weakness of the Persian Administration. It is considered that they have not more than 1,000 rifles, but there may be another 1,000 scattered about Fars exclusive of the coastal belt. [24-70] , RECd. POL. CEPt. '■ V9UEC9U I RCE2 6 . The Commander of ihe Ears Division has been recalled. He is undei suspicion of not only having made no genuine effort to suppress brigandage, but even of having encouraged it by thwarting the efforts of others. 7. The Persian military authorities are now planning operations for the ^ KXTjO restoration of the position in Dashti (see Intelligence Summary No. 25,^ para- ^ graph 6 ). They have reports that the Dashtis are endeavouring to have arms run ^ over from the Arab coast, which they consider might be easy, as, their navy being now in British hands, they have no means of patrolling the Persian coast, along whose length from Bushire to Lingeh Persian Government authority has virtually disappeared. 8 . His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz reports that the situation is quiet and confidence is returning gradually. Some merchants and others who had fled when the Russians arrived are coming back to their homes. Trade and commerce are still dull, but factories are open, working on a reduced scale. Lack of transport to bring in the beet, now ready, and shortly likely to be rotting in the fields, to the factories was preventing the normal production of sugar. The situation along the Turkish border is confused, the Turks convinced that the Russians are instigating, and perhaps even arming, the Kurds, and themselves intriguing among the Turki-speaking people of Western Azerbaijan. 9 . In the Kermanshah area security has improved. In Kurdistan no material change is reported. Officials. 10. The Persian Minister in Rome and the counsellor to the Persian Embassy in Berlin have returned to Tehran. The Minister of Public Health. Merat (Personality 126 of E 832/826/34 of the 24th February, 1940), resigned from the Cabinet. Persian Army. Appointments. 11 . Sarlashkar Siapush (279) to command the Ears Division, vice Sarlashkar Amidi, relieved. Sarlashkar Shaghaghi (270) to command the 13th (Isfahan) Division. vice Sarlashkar Moini (174), relieved. Sarlashkar Mehdavi, Chief of the Intendance, retires. The numbers in brackets refer to Military Attache’s Personalities. A erodromes. 12. The four aerodromes at Tehran, Doshan Tappeh, Qaleh Murgheh, Mehrabad and one about 6 miles west of Tehran known as the Aero Club are to be enlarged and to have runways constructed to make them usable by heavy aircraft. The work is being carried out at the expense of the British Government. British Affairs. 13. The General Officer Commanding British Forces in Iraq arrived in Tehran on the 10th November and met General Novikoff, commanding Russian forces in North-West Persia, on the following day. Questions concerning the future of the Persian forces, their size and distribution, the purchase by the British military authorities of arms and munitions that would now be surplus in the Persian army and the protection of communications were discussed. Some measure of agreement was reached, although General Novikoff was, as usual, cautious and non-committal. 14. Considerable progress has been made in the clearing of the congestion at the port of Bandar Shahpur (P.G.). The waterway of the Karun River is to be developed from Khorramshahr to Ahwaz. These two towns will probably also be connected by a railway.3 Russian Affairs. 15. His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz reports that the Russians are importing 5CC i ' i,rge quantities of goods to Azerbaijan without payment of Persian customs dues. heir intention is to sell them cheap to the consumer, but the middleman manages somehow to get hold of a large proportion with considerable benefit to himself. 16. The Russian military authorities are still unwilling to allow recon naissances by British officers of roads or aerodromes in Russian-occupied territory except as regards roads to be used for the transit of goods to Russia, and then only up to the points where transport will be operated by British authorities. 17. Some 250 Persian officers are still held as prisoners by the Russian ds. General Novikoff says that the release of these may be considered after in troops. General Novikoff says that the release of these may be considered after the treaty is signed. French Interests. 18. Captain Bonneau, late charge d’affaires at Kabul and now “chef de cabinet civile” of General Catroux, General Officer Commanding Free French Forces in the Middle East, arrived in Tehran on a special mission on the 11th November. German Interests. 19. The arrangements mentioned in paragraph 23 of Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the repatriation of a party of sixty-five German women and children have had to be postponed, as all rolling-stock in Iraq is fully taken up for the transportation of Axis nationals being repatriated from Afghanistan through Iraq.

The text finally approved by His Majesty’s Government, which includes some modifications from the original to make it less objectionable to the Persian Parliament and people, had been in the hands of the Soviet Government for some days before it was communicated to their ambassador in Tehran. It had consequently only recently been presented to the Persian Government when the latter, in accordance with constitutional practice, resigned. 2 . The resignation of the Government had nothing to do with the treaty. It is the practice that it should resign when the Deputies of a new Parliament have taken their seats. The election of a large number of Deputies was challenged, so large, indeed, that it was finally agreed by all parties that none should be disqualified. So the Parliament is formed of Deputies chosen by the ex-Shah. They are probably no worse than those who might have taken their place. 3. It is generally anticipated that Feroughi will be asked again to form a Government. There is much speculation as to what new blood he will introduce. Candidates are torn between their desire to hold office and their dislike of having to take the responsibility of accepting the treaty. 4. Hassan Isfandiyari (Haji Muhtasham-us-Saltaneh) (Personalities : Military Attache’s, No/125; Foreign Office, No. 97) has again been elected President of the Majlis, with Bayat (Personalities : Military Attache’s, No. 65; Foreign Office. No. 50) as first and Moayadi Ahmadi as second Vice-President. 5. Broadcasts from Berlin by the Persian Shahrukh continue to be very effective. He makes violent attacks on the Prime Minister and Cabinet, flatters the inglorious army, makes many Persians feel uncomfortable, and reduces numbers to tears by his tales of the betrayal of Persia to the British and Russians. 6 . The ex-Chief of Police of the ex-Shah’s regime, whose duty it was to get rid of persons distasteful to his master, and several other police officials are now undergoing trial on various charges ranging from murder to peculation. Civil Appointments. 7. Reza Saji Nya, formerly Persian Consul-General in the Caucasus, to be charge d’affaires in Irac^ Amanollah Ardalan to be Director-General of the Ministry of the Interior (33, 27).

The Persian press announces— (a) That it is anticipated that on the line from Zinjan to Tabriz the rails will be laid as far as Miandoab by the 20th January, 1942. Note.—W ork has been resumed on the construction of this line. (b) That it has been decided to construct a line from Khorramshahr to Ahwaz—117 kilom.—at a cost of 150 million rials. (c) That it has been decided to construct a line to connect Isfahan with the line now under construction (completed as far as Anarak) from Qum via Nain to Yezd. Internal Conditions. 9. There has been a definite improvement in most parts of the country—in fact, everywhere except in Southern Pars, where robberies continue to occur on the roads; the Qashqai situation is still obscure and the authority of the Persian Government still hardly existent in Dashti and parts of Tanqistan. 10 . Gendarmerie posts are gradually being re-established on the roads whence they had either been driven by the Russians or had deserted. It cannot, however, yet be said that the gendarmerie is reliable, although, on the whole, its i morale appears to be better than that of the army. 11 . There has been some raiding, apparently by Afghans, on the Afghan- Khorassan border. 12. Some rioting occurred at Hamadan on the 19th November as a protest against the reported removal of wheat to Tehran. A British military convoy, which happened to be passing, was stoned by the mob and some Indian soldiers were severely hurt. The escort with the convoy had to open fire to disperse the mob and three of the rioters were killed and three wounded. The effect of this was rather good than otherwise. 13. In Kurdistan there is little change. The Kurds have not yet been evicted from any of the districts of which they had taken possession, but there has been little aggressiveness, and there may even be an inclination to come to terms— perhaps only their own terms—with the Persian authorities. General Shahbakhti. commanding the Persian forces of the West, is reported to have met some of the Kurdish leaders and to have come to terms of some sort with the Qalbaghi, one of the most troublesome tribes. 14. In Azerbaijan there seems to be competition between Turks and Russians for the affections of Moslem Azerbaijanis, Kurds and Armenians. 15. The economic situation remains bad. There is shortage of wheat and sugar, aggravated by shortage of transport. The latter may be due more to lack of tyres than of lorries. Persian Forces. 16. The practical instruction in flying of Persian pilots recommenced on the 23rd November. No Persian machine had been in the air since the armistice. 17. The results of the recruiting drive for voluntary recruits for the army at the relatively high rates of pay of 350-400 rials per month have been one recruit in the Kermanshah area, thirty-nine in the Khorramabad-Burujud area and none in Tehran. This has convinced the Persian military authorities of the impossibility of abolishing conscription. Among the reasons for this very poor response are distrust of the Persian officer and the current propaganda that Persian soldiers are to be taken to fight for the Russians against Germany. 18. Conscripts are coming in slowly and unwillingly. The Minister for War has undertaken to broadcast an assurance of reforms in the application of the conscription law. The question of modifications in the law is also to be brought up for consideration. Although the law in itself is burdensome, it is through the iniquities of its application that the people suffer most. 19. The Khorassan Division and its headquarters at Meshed having been dispersed, an independent force has been temporarily formed to include the garrisons of Birjand, Zabul and Zahidan.British Interests. 20. Lrom the military aspect the situation in Persia is not satisfactory. There is as yet only a very small number who would be at all likely to support the British cause if the Germans were to reach Persia, whereas it may be anticipated |that the Germans would find considerable active support. There are many who .■iieve in the value of co-operation with the Germans, while there are few who are convinced of the value of co-operation with the British. There is disappoint ment that conditions have not improved, that the tyranny of the Shah has merely been replaced by the inefficiency of a constitutional Government, that abuses still continue, that food is scarce and expensive. The treaty is universally unpopular and will only be accepted because of the threat of force in the back ground and of starvation, because Great Britain controls the supply of wheat. Persia is in no sense a willing or enthusiastic ally, and is inveterately hostile to Russia. To secure some useful measure of Persian support in the event of the Germans reaching Persia, a much more striking argument of the benefits that will result from co-operation with the British than has yet been evident must be advanced. Alternatively, Persian sentiment can be ignored and a much greater degree of control imposed. Russian Affairs. ^ 21 . M. Litvinov, Soviet Ambassador-designate to the United States, arrived in Tehran from Moscow on the 17th November and left a few days later for Bagdad on his way to Washington. 22 . The Soviet Ambassador, under instructions from his Government, has demanded that all arms in possession of the Persian Government surplus to those required for the preservation of internal security (the treaty guarantees Persia against external aggression) should be handed over to the Soviet military forces. It had, in any case, been decided by His Majesty’s Government that surplus arms of modern military value should be purchased, whether their destination should be British or Soviet forces. The Soviet Ambassador and Military Attache have obviously had orders to stress the urgent need Russia has of these arms. 23. It is reliably reported from Azerbaijan that Russian officers frequently complain in public of the lack of effective help given to them by the British. 24. Some speculation has been aroused by Russian dealings with tribal chiefs in Azerbaijan. Certain Kurdish chiefs from Sanjbulaqh, Ushnu and the Turkish frontier, leaders of the Shahsevan tribes and notables of the Maku area have been entertained in Tabriz by Soviet authorities. On the 27th November His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz reported that twenty Kurdish chiefs had been ‘ rounded up,” brought to Tabriz as respected guests and sent to Baku for a “ pleasure trip.” It is surmised that the object of these courtesies mav be to counteract Turkish propaganda and intrigues. Russian Troops. 25. There is no doubt that there has been a considerable reduction in the number of Russian troops in Persia and an even greater reduction in tanks, aeroplanes and guns. Tanks and armoured cars have been shipped from Pahlevi! Many more loaded lorries go towards Russia than come from Russia. 26. A report, said to emanate from an authoritative Russian Staff officer, puts the total number of Russian troops at 25,000. Garrisons in some towns have certainly been much reduced. Kazvin has not more than a small detachment; Pahlevi and Naushahr not more than a battalion each with some administrative services; Babulsar a regiment of cavalry and a battalion. 27. Observation of aerodromes in the Russian-occupied zone during the past fortnight showed that there are now very few Russian aircraft in Persia. The following were seen at— Tabriz : 4 machines. Rezaieh : 3 machines. Ardabil: 3 machines. Zinjan : None. Mianeh : None. Khoi : None, Kazvin : None. Pahlevi : None (aerodrome flooded).28. The road from Zinjan to Tabriz and the road and railway from Tabriz to Julfa are guarded by Soviet troops posted at dangerous points. The roads are also guarded by Persian gendarmerie. A merican Interests. 29. Mr. Steinhardt, ambassador of the United States in Moscow, pasjjcvl through Tehran on his recall to the United States. It is understood that he nas been recalled, as was the American Military Attache, partly at least because of the pessimistic view he took of the situation in Russia. 30. Colonel Griffiths, of the American Air Force, who is charged with the mission of investigating possible routes for the supply of American aircraft to Russia, has left for Baku after a short stay in Tehran. 31. The Persian Ministry of Education has invited an American mission to visit Persia for the purpose of investigating and advising on the system of education in Persia. 32. Pan-American Airways have asked the A.I.O.C. to arrange to supply 60,000 gallons of aviation spirit at Askhabad. Egyptian Interests. 33. Zulfikar Pasha, Egyptian Ambassador at Tehran, has left on recall to Cairo. Danish Interests. 34. M. Fensmarck, the Danish Charge d’Affaires in Tehran, has severed connexion with the Danish Government of Copenhagen and has been recognised by the Persian Government as representing Free Danes. Turkish Interests. 35. Jemal Hushnu, the newly-appointed Turkish Ambassador to Persia, has arrived in Tehran. Yugoslav Interests. Reference paragraph 22 of Summary No. 26. 36. Colonel Bankovitch, with a party of seventy Yugoslavs for enlistment in the Yugoslav forces, left Persia via Ahwaz for Egypt. German Interests. 37. A party of fifty-nine German women and children left Tehran on the 29th November in charge of a secretary of the Swedish Legation for repatriation to Germany via Iraq and Angora. These are the families of Germans deported # from Persia to Indian and/or Australia. Polish Interests. 38. General Sikorski arrived in Tehran on the 25th November and left for Kuibyshev and Moscow, where he is to meet Stalin on the 28th. He was accom panied by General Klimecki and Major Cazalet and was met at Tehran by General Anders, commanding the Polish forces in Russia. The latter spoke very highly of the high morale of the troops. Russian officials in Tehran showed remarkable friendliness and courtesy to the party. General Sikorski travelled from Tehran to Baku in a Soviet aircraft, but some of his staff went in a British Douglas. Swedish Interests. 39. M. von Herdenstam, Swedish Minister at Tehran, has left on his return to Sweden. He has been succeeded by M. Sven Harald Tousette as charge d’affaires. Chinese Interests. 40. Mr. Wong Yu-chen, an official of the Chinese Legation in Angora, is now visiting Tehran with a view to the establishment of a Chinese Consulate- General in Persia. Tehran, December 1 , 1941.A- Sir R.

Persian Affairs. 1 . -THE statement in paragraph 1 of Summary No. 28 to the effect that the final text of the treaty had been presented to the Persian Government was pre mature. It has now been presented with the intimation that it must be accepted or rejected as it stands. 2. The new Cabinet has been formed as follows : — Feroughi (87) (71): President of the Council. Ahi (7) (5): Justice. Soheily (283) (—) : Foreign Affairs. *Tadayyun (288) (207) : Education. ^General Ahmadi (21) (16) : Interior. General Ahmadi Nakchevan (193) (146): War. Musharraf Nafisi (190) (142) : Finance. Gulshayan : Commerce and Industry. General Jahanbani (132) (100) : Ways and Communications. Hamid Sayah (258) (187): Posts and Telegraphs. Hakimi (106) (81) : Agriculture. *Baghir Kazimi (142) (105): Public Health. (The first figure refers to Military Attache’s and the second to Foreign Office Personalities.) 3 . The new Ministers are an improvement on those they have replaced. Tadayyun has long been a prominent and influential figure in Persian domestic politics; General Ahmadi, who is the senior active general of the Persian army, has been for the last three months an effective and energetic Military Governor of Tehran. He has an extensive knowledge of the internal situation in Persia, has a reputation for ruthlessness and is accused of having amassed considerable wealth. 4. Ebrahim Qavam, who as Qavam-ul-Mulk and head of the Khamseh tribes played a large part in the troubled situation during and for some years after the last war, always unshakenly on the side of the British, has left for India. He has sold a part of his properties and may not return to Persia for some time, if at all. * New Ministers. [24—97] RECo Pv .. INDIA' 'Cff5. The Government is again considering an old project for leading the waters of the Kuhrang River into the Zandehrud (see Degree Sheet No. 9, L, Square BC 2 ), with a view to increasing the irrigated area of the Isfahan Plain. It is announced that work will begin in the spring. 6 . An announcement is made in the press that it is hoped to commence work on the Khorramshahr-Ahwaz railway in January. Internal Security. 7. Only trivial incidents of disorder have been reported during the week, and it is hoped that this is an indication that order, at least on the main routes, is slowly being restored. The larger problems, however, still remain untackled : Kurdistan, Dashti, parts of the Gulf littoral and the Qashgai country are still free from Persian Government authority. 8 . In Kurdistan there appears to be little change. There are reports that the two chiefs, Muhammad Rashid and Muhammad Riza, are concerned at the Persian attempts to settle matters by agreement and are planning measures to prevent a settlement. 9. No action has yet been taken against Dashti (see Intelligence Summary No. 27, paragraph 7). On the contrary, according to reports received by His Majesty’s Consul-General, Bushire, Persian troops 'had been withdrawn and the local chiefs recognised by the Persian authorities as responsible for order. 10 . No move against the Government has yet been made by Nasir Khan and the Qashgai. It is reassuring that Nasir has sent his brother and son to Shiraz. A fpointment. 11 . Musa Nuri Isfandiari (—) (99) : to be Persian Minister in Bagdad. Persian Forces. 12. It has been announced in the press that it is proposed to form eight Gendarmerie Commands in Persia and to maintain a force of twenty-seven independent units, of the approximate size of a battalion, and 200 independent companies. I he force is to include cyclists, motor-cyclists and, if the equipment can be obtained, motorised units. British Interests. 13. A statement has been made in the Persian press giving the lie to the rumours that have been actively propagated for some time, to the effect that the shortage of wheat is due to purchases by British troops. It is added that during the month 20th October to 19th November 14,174 tons of wheat had been imported from India. 14. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, visited His Majesty’s Legation on the 29th November. Russian Interests. 15. the Soviet military authorities do now appear to be encouraging the Persian authorities to re-establish gendarmerie posts within the limits of numbers and in the areas agreed upon, and to have given permission for conscrip tion to be applied. Incidents, however, still occur of gendarmes and police being disarmed by Soviet troops, but these are usually troops who have recently arrived in the country. In the frontier towns of Julfa, Khvi and Maku the administra tion is, however, to all intents and purposes, Russian. 16. There have been a number of murders of Caucasian refugees in the Russian-occupied zone and in Tehran. The victims have been of Turkish origin or Armenians. The former ar.e believed by the Persian police to be Turkish agents. The Turkish Embassy and the Persian police are convinced that the murders are the work of the Ogpu.3 17. Reference Summary No. 28, paragraph 24. The following are among the Kurdish chiefs taken to Baku by the Russians :— Qazi Muhammad, Haji Baba Shukh, Majid Qareh, j- All of Sauj Bulagh. Ahmad Khan Begzadeh, Amir Aian, Qaraineh Agha, 1 Of the Manush tribe between Rezaieh and Sauj Hamza Agha, J Bulagh. Ibrahim Agha, Ali Khan, Bayazid Agha : J- Of Manqur, near Sauj Bulagh. said to be of a sub-tribe called Gaurah. Muhammad Amin Agha : said to be of a sub-tribe called Piran To these have also now been added some Shahsevan chiefs. 18. Reports from various sources agree that the behaviour of Russian troops towards the poorer classes in the occupied areas is friendly and correct. This merely adds to the anxiety of the upper classes of Persians regarding the effects of Russian propaganda. Turkish Interests. 19. The Turkish Military Attache professes some anxiety about the Kurdish situation. The success of the Persian Kurds in freeing themselves of Persian administration had disturbed the Kurds of Iraq and Turkey. Some Kurdish chiefs who had fled from Turkey during the last Turkish operations against the Kurds and had by agreement with the Persian Government been interned in Central and Eastern Persia had been allowed to escape, and were now back in Persian Kurdistan near the Turkish border. Whispers of an independent Kurdish State were being heard in all Kurdish-inhabited territory. Our policy of neutrality in the Kurdish rebellion against the Persian Government could, he thought, only be interpreted as sympathy with the Kurds. The Russians, he thought, were openly encouraging ideas of an independent Kurdistan. Hungarian and Bulgarian Interests. 20. The Swedish Legation in Tehran, which is responsible for these interests in Tehran, is arranging for the repatriation of a number of Bulgarian and Hungarian nationals. American Interests. 21. An American irrigation expert, Professor Windsor, has arrived in Tehran as an adviser to the Ministry of Agriculture. 22. Major Johnson, United States army, a member of the Wheeler Mission, has arrived in Tehran. Czech Interests. 23. A party of twenty-five Czech soldiers arrived in Tabriz saying they had come from Syria, where they found life too peaceful, to fight Germans in Russia. The Russian military authorities refused to allow them to go on, but have agreed to send them to Tehran for despatch to Syria. Tehran, December 8 , 1941.J-w ..'’rjKi.TIAL.

Tehran, December 17, 1941. Enclosure. Summary No. 30 for the Period Wl % Military Attache's Intelligence December 9-15, 1941. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. ON the 14th December the Prime Minister explained the foreign policy of the Government to Parliament. He began with a statement, on the whole fair and reasonable, of the arguments by which Great Britain and Russia might justify their attack on Persia which had brought about the situation'with which the Government was now faced. Lines of communication through Persia and the right to take military measures for the protection of their territories lying adjacent to Persia the Allies would insist on having. If Persia did not collaborate, she would forfeit the friendly feelings of the Allies. He gave a fair outline of the terms of the treaty, acknowledged the economic help in the form of wheat and sugar that the Allies had already given, and left it to his hearers to infer that the continuance of this help depended on the acceptance of the treaty. The Prime Minister referred to relations with Turkey and to articles which had recently appeared in the Turkish press concerning the alleged oppression of so-called Turkish minorities in Persia (see Summary No. 26, paragraph 21). He had been assured by the Turkish Government that the views expressed in those articles were the personal views of the writer and did not represent the views of the Turkish Government. It is too early yet to say what impression was made by the speech on the Parliament or the public. It was followed by a vote of confidence in the Government. 2. Further delay in the signature of the treaty has been caused by difficulties in getting the Russians to agree to the Persian translation and in reconciling the Russian text with the British. All three texts are to be authentic. • Russian successes against the Germans have undoubtedly lessened the opposition to the treaty. 3. The Ministry of Commerce has been amalgamated with the Ministry of Industry and Mines. 4. The Persian Government has prohibited the export from Persia of all goods of foreign origin. Internal Situation. 5. Reports from consuls generally indicate a slight improvement in the food situation, no increase in disorder, except in Kurdistan, and in Fars an improve ment in security. Nasir Khan and the Qashgai are watching events, and particularly the effect of British neutrality in Kurdistan. Kurdish Situation. 6 . The situation in Kurdistan has become tense. Mohamed Rashid, apparently appreciating that it was time to take action before General Shahbakhti’s negotiations or intrigues effected disruption in his following, is•2 threatening to seize the village of Diwan Darreh, where there is a garrison of about 400 Persian troops, and to advance to Bijar. In present circumstances it seems unlikely that he will attack Senneh, where there is a garrison of British troops, since much of the support that he has among Kurds is based on his claim &gt; that he has British sympathy in his attempt to establish a Persian Kurdistan free from Persian authority. Consequently, the attack on a patrol of the 6 th Indian 7 f Division, which resulted in the death of an Indian officer and an Indian soldier, may have been a mistake. Details have not been received, but it is reported that the assailants were from the Qalbaghi tribe. The possibility that this attack may have been put up by persons interested in embroiling British troops with the Kurds may be deserving of consideration. 7. I he Persian military authorities are not anxious to go to war with the Kurds, and the Government is genuinely desirous of reaching a peaceful settle ment. A commission has been approved to investigate Kurdish grievances and to consider the restitution of lands of which the owners have been legally dispossessed. It is probable that the Government would also agree to appoint Kurdish Governors, but they must be of their own choosing, and there must be the outward semblance at least of Persian Government authority. 8 . The situation is further complicated by Russian dealings with Kurdish chiefs (see Summary No. 28, paragraph 24). There is no indication that these have as their object the restoration of Government authority among the Kurds. Rather are they interpreted as evidence of Russian encouragement of Kurdish aspirations. 9. His Majesty’s Minister has authorised His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah to give the maximum publicity to a statement that British policy does not support Mohamed Rashid, but is to encourage the Persian Government to redress legitimate grievances while restoring their own authority in Kurdistan. Persian Army. 10 The following arms have been lost by the Persian forces since the invasion :— Rifles : Over 100,000. L. M.G. : Nearly 2 . 000 . M. M.G. : About 600. Mtn. guns : 60. Field guns 105 : 72. The guns are presumably in the hands of British and Russian forces, but a considerable number of the rifles and machine guns must be in the hands of tribes and brigands. This is a cause of great anxiety in the Persian General Staff' regarding internal security in the spring. Russian Affairs. 11 . The Soviet military authorities have agreed to release the Persian officers and n.c.os. whom they have been holding as prisoners. Twenty-nine officers and a number of n.c.os. have already been released. The total number of officer prisoners is believed to be about 250. 12 . The Soviet military authorities have demanded a considerable reduction in the number of armed men police and gendarmerie—which they had previously agreed to allow in the Russian-occupied zone. For example, the number of armed police in Tabiiz is to be reduced from 400 to 205 men, and the gendarmerie in Azerbaijan from 4,000 to 1,500. 13. I he Russians have exported from Pahlevi large quantities of iron m various forms which was alleged to belong to German firms. The amount is said to exceed 1,000 tons. Yugoslav Interests. 14.

THE treaty was presented to the Majlis on the 21st and published in the press on the 22nd. It is early yet to assess public sentiment, but it can be said that its reception has not been altogether unfavourable. There was some vigorous criticism in a secret session of Parliament, but at the next session on the 28th, when the Bill had its first reading, opinion seemed to be rather more favourable than adverse. Some of the local newspapers have presented fair arguments for its acceptance. It will be read in the Majlis a second time during the coming week, and informed opinion considers that it will be approved. 2. In the provinces, as far as available information goes, the treaty has provoked little comment. Bread and sugar remain the chief interest of the people. 3. In private conversations with members of the legation staff the Shah has emphasised his complete loyalty to the terms of the treaty. Persia is now definitely on the side of the Allies, and he would use his influence to persuade the people that collaboration was in the best interests of the country, both as regards the present and the future. He does not like the wording of the last sentence of article 3 (2) (a), which limits the role of Persian forces to the maintenance of internal security. He considers that for the restoration of morale it is essential that the Persian army should be inspired with a determination to defend Persian soil if the Germans should ever reach it. Last-minute endeavours were made by the Government for an alteration in the wording of this paragraph to give the Persian army a less humble role. The Shah associates himself closely with his army, feels deeply the humilia tion it has suffered, and is really anxious for the restoration of its prestige and morale. 4 . The Shah’s popularity is increasing, and he impresses Europeans who meet him as a reasonable, unaffected and simple man with the interests of his people at heart. 5. The Persian Government has prohibited the export of cotton and leather goods produced in local factories. Appointments. 6 .

Kurdistan .—The Chief of the General Staff claims that successful military action was taken against Muhammad Rashid and the Kurds who were threatening Diwandarreh, resulting in appreciable Kurdish casualties and the withdrawal of Muhammad Rashid. It is not clear whether there has been an^^ real fighting between Kurds and Persian troops. Air action by leaflets and bombs was taken; a column did move to the relief of Diwandarreh; and Muhammad Rashid has withdrawn some distance. It is also reported that the Qalbaghi, who were previously said to have come to terms,^have again sued for peace. The General Staff now speak of reoccupying Sagiz and Baneh. tai 8 . Impartial reports state that even among the Kurds as far north as Lake Urmia it is commonly said that Muhammad Rashid has the support of the ^ British. There, however, he commands little support. Two chiefs, Mohammed Riza and Mohammed Shirif, are reported to have announced that they were fytm drawing pay for the upkeep of 300 horsemen from the British. Ku/\&lt;te. 9. Some of the Kurdish chiefs who were invited to Baku by the Soviet authorities have returned, and on their return paraded the streets of Rezaieh with red flags and pictures of Stalin. Kurds appear in the streets of Tabriz and other towns carrying arms without interference by the Persian authorities, who fear to risk Russian displeasure. Both in Tehran and Azerbaijan Persian authorities express much anxiety about Russian policy towards the Kurds. His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz, however, considers those fears to be exaggerated. 10 . There have been no reports during the last fortnight of serious disturbances to internal security.* A minor operation was carried out by Persian forces, assisted by some Mamasenni tribesmen, against the Buvair Ahmadi, which resulted in the capture of some robbers. Nasir Qashgai is reported to be advancing to Larestan with a Qashgai force to relieve a Persian garrison which has been isolated for some time and to collect arms for the Persian Government. He is subsequently to endeavour to collect arms in Dashti. 11 . Reports that Ganawah was threatened by a forcfe of tribesmen turned out to be without foundation. Persian Forces. 12. The Persian General Staff has drawn up an establishment for a reorganised army of five divisions, with a strength of 80,500, including recruits, and a general reserve of 19.000. According to their statement, the army is greatly deficient in the minimum requirements of motor transport for mobility and maintenance. Indeed, it is deficient in all services. 13. The state of morale is still low. The army is suffering not only from the collapse of its prestige, but also from a lack of incentive and a lack of direction. The Chief of the General Staff is a forcible personality, and he has around him some intelligent and honest officers, but demoralisation has gone so far that, at best, it will be some time before morale is restored. That will only be done by setting before it some goal that makes an appeal to its interest. A fyointments. 14. Brigadier Key Kavoussi to command the 14th (Kerman) Division. Brigadier Ghulam Ali Ghadar to be Military Governor of Tehran. Brigadier Farajollah Aghevli ( 6 ) (25) to be head of the gendarmerie, vice Brigadier Zahidi (303) (217), who resigned when General Ahmadi (21) ( 6 ) became Minister of the Interior. Brigadier Khosrow Panah to be Director of Recruiting, vice Brigadier Farajollah Aghevli (see above). (The first figure refers to Military Attache’s, the second to Foreign Office. Personalities.) 15. The Persian Government have agreed, as a result of a joint repre sentation by the British Minister and the Soviet Ambassador, to sell 100.000 rifles, 800 light machine guns, 400 medium machine guns, all of 7-92-mm. calibre. All these will go to Russia with the exception of 25 per cent, of the automatic weapons' f i 3 ox ^ &amp;-e«o o^Jl British Affairs. 16.

They were here mainly interested in plans for the acceleration of the transit of munitions and aircraft to Russia. They visited the Caspian ports and found the Russians nearly as difficult of approach as do the British. They left on the 28th by train for Alhwaz. —. J . Polish Affairs. 19. General Sikorski, accompanied by General Klimecki and General Anders, returned from Russia on the 16th December. He was very well satisfied with his mission. The Poles in Russia are to be concentrated in Trans-Caspia and there trained and equipped, with the exception of 25,000 who are to be evacuated through Persia to Mideast and Great Britain. After certain conferences in Tehran regarding arrangements for the evacuation of these Poles, General Sikorski left for Cairo and General Anders for Russia. A Polish mission under Colonel Machnowski, who has already arrived, is to come to Persia from Mideast to assist with the evacuation. Russian Affairs. 20. The local Soviet authorities are insisting that the operation of the 1 ail way from Qum northwards should be under their control. The serious objections to this are obvious. I he matter has been referred to London and Moscow. In this, as in other matters, co-operation with the local Soviet authorities is difficult, largely owing to the restrictive orders issued to them by Moscow and the very small scope of the initiative allowed to them. 21 . The first consignment of tanks destined for Russia to arrive by the Trans-Persian route—twenty light British tanks—was handed over to the Russians at Zinjan on the 21 st December. Two British officers and five British n.c.os. remained at Zinjan until the 27th as instructors with the Russians, who themselves decided that instruction was unnecessary beyond that date. 22. The Soviet authorities continue to release batches of Persian officer- prisoners. 23. The port of Bandar Shah (Bandar Caspian) is being dredged by the Russians. They anticipate that by February there will be a 13-ft. channel to the jetties. 24. Various new consular posts are being opened in Persia by the Soviet authorities. The old consulate-general at Meshed has been reopened and consuls also been appointed to Bush ire, Ahwaz and Kermanshah.

Ai£lO Persian A ffairs. THE treaty has passed the first reading in the Majlis. There has been criticism, but on the whole there appears to be a feeling of relief to find on consideration that the terms are not so bad as rumour had led the public to anticipate. There has even been some effective defence of the treaty in the Majlis and in the press. There is an increasing tendency to consider its potential advantages to the State or the individual, and there are indications of a more favourable sentiment towards the British. This is perhaps strengthened by t]ie deep distrust of Russia, which finds increasing justification in Russian politidal actions in northern provinces, more especially in Azerbaijan. The decrease in hostile feeling is also largely due to the retreat of the Germans in Russia and the consequent damage to the legend of German invincibility. The three months for which Germans on leaving Persia had paid advance rent for their houses and advance wages to their servants have passed, and the impression created by this —to Persians—convincing action has been followed by a corresponding depression among their sympathisers. A fp ointment s. 2. —(i) Ali Mansour (164) (120) has been appointed Governor-Geperal of Khorassan in place of Pakravan (208) (154). Ali Mansour was Prime Minister in August of 1941. He is considered by some to be pro-German, but is of too colourless a character to have any strong political convictions. It is not likely that the Russians would accept him as Governor of Khorassan unless satisfied of his innocuousness. (ii) Mohamed Qaraguzlou to be Governor (“ Farmandar ') of Bandar Abbas. (iii) Ali Asghar Itisam, now Governor of Maragheh, to be Governor of Khoi. (iv) Ismail Bahadur (54) (—) to be Governor of Maragheh. (v) Rahmatullah Hushmand to be head of the Municipality and Governor of Bushire. (The first figures refer to Military Attache’s and second to Foreign Office Personalities.) 3. The economic situation shows little improvement. The cost of living goes up; prices of imported goods, in particular, are soaring in spite of the pro hibition on export. There are still local shortages of wheat and sugar, due in part to lack of transport, which in its turn is due to lack of tyres, of which there is a critical shortage. [26—11] b [rECd. POL. EEPt. I 7 FEB 942 INDIA OFFICE '2 Intei'nal Security. 4. Generally the improvement in internal security seems to be maintained. There are no reports of disturbances except from the Kermanshah Province, where Lurs, principally Kakavand and Ahmad ivand, have been robbing, but, as far as reports go, not on a serious scale. ^ 5. It is reported from Shiraz that Jahrum (D.S. 17H, 3230), where therd^ is a small garrison of Amnieh, is being attacked by local rebels led by one named~ Zaighami. A battalion of infantry, with two armoured cars and a field gun. has moved from Shiraz to restore the situation. It is possible that some Qashgais are assisting the rebels. There is no further information of Naser Qashgai’s operations in Larestan. but the Persian authorities seem to be fairly confident of his good faith at present. 6 . There seems to be little change in the position in Kurdistan. Their brief success has hardened the attitude of the Persian military authorities, who. anxious to re-establish their prestige, now talk less of peace by negotiation. This bellicosity is, however, likely to be tempered by more moderate counsels as the Government is aware that there is more at stake than the defeat of the rebel leader, Mohamed Rashid. If, however, he could be induced to return to Iraq the situation would be greatly simplified and the way would then be clearer for a reasonable settlement, which might be reached with the help of influential Kurds in Tehran. 7. Ihe “official'' Order of Battle of the Persian army, as given by the War Office, is attached as an appendix. Many of the units exist in little more than name as a justification for paying the officers, and all are considerably under strength. A reorganisation is intended (see Summary No. 31/1941. paragraph 12 ). 8 . The reorganisation of the Amnieh has been delayed by the resignation of General Zahidi, who drew up the scheme (see Summary No. 29 ; 1941. paragraph 12 ). Political. Russian Affairs. , 9. There are accumulating reasons for suspecting that the Soviet political authorities are carrying out a purge of their enemies in Persia. A number of murders have been committed, a few in Tehran, more in Azerbaijan, of Caucasian refugees and known Turkish agents. A serious attempt was made to murder General Vigornitsky, a harmless old White Russian who considered himself the local representative of the heirs of the Tsars. Babayan, the head of the Armenian Dashnak party in Tehran, has recently disappeared. Other White Russians have disappeared and there is considerable anxiety in the community. 10 . It is reported from a reliable source that the Kurds* and Azerbaijani notables who visited Baku were told by Bakhiroff, President of the Soviet Azerbaijan Republic, that they were not to regard the visit as having any political significance and that Azerbaijan would be evacuated after the war. On the other hand, the Turkish Consul at Tabriz has stated that his information is that the Kurds were told that their hopes would soon be realised and the £v*ervAzerbaijanis that the frontier between Soviet and Persian Azerbaijan no longer Cffwtva fo existed. It is not impossible that both stories are correct, for Soviet official pronouncements are often at variance with the words and actions of subordinate i political officials. ■to. n. It is difficult, in the face of evidence that comes from Azerbaijan, to twfa Aievbay- absolve the Soviet political authorities from the charge of encouraging anti- -&lt;Ws W Government elements in the province. Of the two principal newspapers published Md W to in Tabriz, one strongly anti-Government and advocating autonomy for LmJd*. ^ z - ei T ai j al b the other supporting the Persian Government, the former has increased to a bi-weekly issue, while the latter has been suppressed by the Soviet lAifotl “un a- authorities, and its offices raided for publishing alleged “ Fascist ” propaganda An extract from the former is attached as an appendix : it gives an idea of itr 6 c - the colour of the news P a P er - The Soviet authorities themselves also publish a newspaper m Tabriz, m Azerbaijan Turki, needless to say without having asked Cc/v uaA Sc*** the permission of the Persian authorities. Junior political officers distribute ^ti(i‘o^jthis paper to tea-houses and schools, although the higher Soviet authorities main-3 (xT tain that the paper is published solely for their own people. An indication of its temper is given in the extract given in the appendix (Appendix “ B ”/ 2 )- 12. A society calling itself “‘Nijat” (Freedom) has been formed in Urumieh which includes Kurds, Assyrians and Armenians. Its aims are obvious ••from its name. The local Turkish Consul has reported somewhat alarmingly to liis ambassador on the activities of this society. 13. Having regard to the activities referred to in the preceding paragraphs, the Soviet insistence on the reduction of police and Amnieh mentioned in Summary No. 30/1941, paragraph 12 , does not seem consistent with a desire to see lawful authority established in the province. 14. Four British news-reels that were being shown in Tabriz were confiscated by the Soviet authorities and the proprietor of the cinema concerned imprisoned. The reason is supposed to have been because Hitler was shown in some form other than that of a monster. Russian Troops. 15. A reliable informant, who has recently visited Meshed, reports that there were ninety aircraft on the aerodrome. From the activity he saw he judged that the aerodrome was being used as a training school. 16. The same informant reports a strong Russian garrison at Semnan, where there was the headquarters of some formation, not many troops in evidence at Meshed, the headquarters and greater part of an infantry regiment at Kuchan. All the troops he saw in North-Eastern Persia were better clothed and more soldierly than those he had recently seen on a tour in North-Western Persia. 17. The road from Meshed to the frontier at Bajgiran is being repaired by the Russians. From the frontier towards Meshed the first 40 miles are now in good repair. The remainder (some 44 miles) to Meshed is in bad condition. From Bajgiran to Askhabad there is a first-class road, mostly tarmac.

Strangers have taj^o advantage of our sincerity and simplicity to stir up strife and enmity among-us, and have hindered all progress. It is time to wake up, to put away enmity and cease being a tool in the hands of others, who have always tried to destroy tlhe Azerbaijanis, because they realised that, if Moslems, Armenians, Kurds, Assyrians and others were to unite, they would form a nation famous throughout hast and West. We call specially upon the Kurds and Shahsevanis, the brave tribes of purer origin, to realise that they are Azerbaijanis and to join us in unity and friendship. 2 . Extract from Vatan Yolinda, a Red Army Newspaper Published at Tabriz, dated December 17, 1941. Letter from Urmia. Dear Red Army, Your releasing a nation from misery and disaster is better than a matter of conscience (i.e., than a quibble over ideology?). We Kurds, one of the oldest and noblest of races, have been oppressed by our enemies, and for some years have had no pleasure in life. In a fertile district like Kurdistan poor villagers, farmers and workers could not find bread—where were the crops going? The Fascists regarded Kurds and Azerbaijanis as the lowest of men, calling the former cruel savages and the latter Turki asses. On the 27th August the Red army came and, after killing a few Fascists, released thousands of oppressed patriots. That date is one written in ineffaceable letters in Kurdish hearts. Dear Red Army, there is a voice crying in Kurdistan and saying : “ Please carry out your good deeds to the end and complete our freedom, so that as long as the world lasts the Kurds may be your brothers.” RAHMAN ZABIHI, ___ _ A Kurd of Sauj Bulaqh.

THE treaty has not yet gone to the Majlis for the second reading, large number of modifications and demands for further explanations suggested by Deputies during the first reading, all except a few were rejected by the Cabinet. The Cabinet did not ask for any modification in the treaty itself, but requested that certain articles should be more clearly and fully defined in letters to be annexed to the treaty. This request has been refused by His Majesty’s Govern ment. The Berlin radio had confidently predicted that it would be refused, but suggested that His Majesty’s Government would put the onus of refusal on to the Soviet Government. LOaJll( Of a OtAJL 2. The Prime Minister, both by his own speeches and through obvious inspired articles that have appeared in the press, has been making a fairly effective defence of the treaty and of the policy of the Government that led to its initialling. A paper that ventured to express that section of public opinion which is opposed to the treaty was suppressed—a shock to those who hoped that the days of freedom of speech had arrived. But the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are still very susceptible to the criticism of the Majlis and the public. Conscious that they have as yet little support on which to lean, in spite of the respect which the Prime Minister is held for his honesty, though not for his energy, they are anxious to placate public opinion as far as is possible. 3. The Government is so concerned with the business of getting the treaty through the Majlis that all other business is suffering. Little has been done towards a settlement of the question of the late Shah’s large estates. Formerly dependent on forced labour for their cultivation they now lie fallow to a large extent. Other questions needing early attention are the resuscitation of agricul ture, the reorganisation of the gendarmerie and the army, the fundamental readjustment of the country’s finances, the distribution of supplies and food and the control of prices. The Government has announced that it is drafting a Bill for the prevention of hoarding and profiteering. 4. The desire that America should become a party to the Anglo-Russian- Persian Treaty, which has been evident in Tehran for some time, has now found expression in articles in the Persian press, particularly on the occasion of Mr. Bullitt’s visit. 5. The press has recently published articles indicating the advantages Persia has gained from relations with Great Britain, Soviet Russia, America and Turkey. Great Britain is given credit for following a consistent policy—since the time of Lord Curzon—of supporting the Central Government. (The inference [26—26] RECa POL. DEPt, j I 6 MAR. 942 J ^ INDIA OFFICE || T\2 is perhaps that Great Britain did support Reza Shah.) Russia is thanked for the concessions she made to Persia after the last war—the gift of the Tabriz- Julfa railway and of the Russian Bank, among others. To America, Persia owes much for the services rendered by Schuster, Millspaugh and Dr. Jordan, of the American College. Turkey is praised for her sympathetic attitude during the troubles of the last few months. 6 . The Berlin radio announced that a neutral paper had stated that a result of Mr. Eden’s talks in Moscow had been an agreement with Russia for the partition of Persia. A dementi, based on the assurances of the British Minister and the Soviet Ambassador, was published in the Persian press, as was also a statement by the Prime Minister. It loo ^ \ Civil Aviation. 7. In answer to questions in Parliament, the Minister of War gave some details regarding the Aero Club of Tehran. The club was founded there years ago; the total income from subscriptions and donations had amountecT to aTlittle over 28 million rials. Of this, nearly 2 f million had been spent on the purchase of 25 Rearwin instructional aircraft; nearly 3^ million on the levelling of an aerodrome and construction of hangars. The balance to the credit of the club was 13,876,495 rials. There are nearly 3,000 members, of whom 400 have flown. A py ointments. 8 .

The Persian Government is greatly concerned about the situation in the Russian occupied zone, where various insurrectionary activities are evident which the Russian authorities take no steps to prevent, and which the Persian forces, limited to small numbers of gendarmerie and police by Russian orders, are much too weak to suppress. The Nijat Committee, in Urumieh, to which reference was made in Summary No. 1/42, paragraph 12. is employing terrorist methods. TheJocalEEierorpoTice and an Assyrian who refused to join the movement have been murdered, and the Governor and all Government officials have been frightened into complete passivity. In the area south of Ardebil the Khalkhalis, a Turki-speaking tribe allied to the Shahsevans, having acquired a number of rifles from disintegrating Persian troops, have expelled such semblances of Government authority as there were in their area. A report, requiring verifica tion, has just been received that some 2,000 armed Karadaghis from the Karadagh mountains (east of Julfa and south of the Aras River), declaring allegiance °to Soviet Russia, took possession of Persian Julfa. The Soviet authorities in Tabriz deny any support of this movement, but whatever the truth of the report may be it may be assumed that no such action could take place in this area without the connivance of the Soviet authorities. In Southern Majandiran^ the inhabi tants of the Sang i San region (between Firuzkuh ancf ^ernnan ), always turbulent, + Af&gt;b&lt;MW(y who have also acquired arms from deserting Persian soldiers, are raiding and r m -&gt; ’ robbing on a fairly extensive scale. The Persian Government has asked the Soviet • a a/ * &lt;f * A 'V' authorities for permission to send a battalion of infantry to each of the three m areas, Urumieh, Ardebil and Southern Mazandirah.* €&amp;cA ca** . Pars. So. m r\(pr\ 10 . The Persian operations for the relief of Jahrum (see Summary 5) were successful. The rebels were dispersed and the rebel leaders, Zaighann and Shikuhi, are reported to have taken refuge with Nasir Qashgai. The Persian authorities have demanded that Nasir should hand them over. They have already found reason to be suspicious of Nasir’s intentions and regard this as a test case of his loyalty. They are alive to the possibility thatNasir’s present professions of loyalty and of a desire to serve the interests of the Persian Government may be bluff to gain time to consolidate his influence with the tribe and to acquire arms. manshah and Kurdistan. 11. There are no further developments in that part of Kurdistan affecting British lines of communication. The local Persian military authorities appear to have postponed their plans for the occupation of Saggiz, pleading winter con ditions, and to be devoting their endeavours to the disarmament of tribes living near the main Kasvin-Khanakin road, notably the Qalhaghis, the Kalkhalis in the Shahabad area, the Kakavand of the Hassin. The General Officer Com manding at Kermanshah has issued a proclamation threatening very severe measures if arms are not surrendered. It is too early yet to anticipate results. Persian Forces. 12. It is intended to form a special force of gendarmerie for the protection of the railway. First consideration is to be given to the railway north of Tehran. British Interests. 13. A proposal has been made to the Persian Government that the British air force authorities should lease the Persian aircraft factory for the period of the war, employing as far as possible the Persian technical staff and Persian labour. The proposal has been surprisingly well received by the Persian authorities, possibly from fear that the factory might be taken over by the Russians, who have recently been showing some interest in it. 14. The new pipe-line for the conveyance of white spirit to Andimishk has been laid for the first 30 miles of its length. American Interests. * 15. Mr. Bullitt paid a short visit to Tehran during the week. He was very well received by Persians. Bulgarian Interests. 16. The Swedish Legation, charged with the interests of Bulgarian nationals in Persia, have asked for the repatriation of about 120 Bulgarians via Iraq and Turkey. The request is still under careful consideration both by the Soviet and British authorities in Tehran. According to instructions from the Bulgarian Government to the Swedish authorities in Persia, all unemployed Bulgarians are paid a dole of 30 rials per diem. Hungarian Interests. 17. A party of fifty-eight Hungarian women and children, accompanied by several male adults of over military age and two sick, left Tehran on the 8 th January by train for repatriation to Hungary via Basra, Bagdad and Angora. Travelling with this party as far as Ahwaz were nine Hungarians of military age who had themselves volunteered for internment with the British. E. S.

The treaty is still in cold storage. It has not yet gone to the Majlis for the second reading as, to avert the Prime Minister’s resignation, which was nearly an accomplished fact, certain points, on which the Soviet Government have been more complaisant than His Majesty’s Government, have been referred back to London. Meanwhile, the press refrain from any mention of the treaty. 2. The dearness of living, the freedom of the press, the necessity for the revival of agriculture and for a new economic plan are the main themes of newspaper articles. 3. A strong desire is becoming evident among Persians to get America more interested in Persian affairs. On the part of many this arises from the all- pervading fear of Russia: America is regarded as possibly being in some respects in a better position to oppose Russian designs on Persia than Great Britain. But some Persians have a better motive. They realise that the existing chaos in administration is not likely to be remedied by Persian politicians and Ministers and that foreign help is necessary particularly to put the finances in order. American Financial Advisers might in present circumstances find a fair measure of support. The Chief of the General Staff would welcome American control of the financial administration of the War Office. The Minister of War has probably other views. 4. Conditions in the Ministry of Finance are reported to be extremely confused. That the Government is faced with a serious loss of revenue and that expenditure is greater than income is said to be about all that is clear. No revenue is coming from the provinces in Russian occupation, nor from certain other areas where Government authority is too weak to enforce its payment. The Russians pay no customs on any goods imported by them, nor the British on goods imported for any military purpose. Moreover, owing to the breakdown of Persian administration along the frontiers, there is considerable smuggling in and out. The abolition of monopolies has also upset the financial balance, and the agreement with the A.I.O.C. for the maintenance of the royalties at the pre-war level has expired. The Ministry of Finance has hitherto been unable to make even an approximate estimate of the current revenue. Officials. 5.—(i) Qiami, to be Deputy Ustandar and Farmandar of Kermanshah.

(The first figures refer to Military Attache’s, and second to Foreign Office, Personalities.) internal Security. Northern Provinces. 6. The situation in Persian Azerbaijan has further deteriorated. The Persian Governor has been driven out of Urumieh and it seems that all semblance of Government authority has disappeared, and that the Nijat Committee is now in control of the town. There was fighting between Kurds and the Amnieh, and it seems certain that the Russian troops stationed in Urumieh did nothing to help the Persian forces. It seems impossible that these events should have happened without the approval of the Russian authorities. Further details of k&lt;i 5 f’h e situation are expected shortly, as His Majesty’s Consul in Tabriz is visiting tt : ~ u ^— a —''-'‘nn has been received of the turbulence of the Khalkhalis, to have taken possession of the small town of Hirabad, Ardebil. The report mentioned in last week’s Summary cUdCr to of an incursion of armed Karadaghis into Persian Julfa was exaggerated. It I * is nearer the truth that a band of some 300, some armed, did enter the town . wearing red arm bands and declaring themselves Communists. 7. In Mazanderan there is some brigandage and a great deal of discontent arising from the failure of the Government to take any measures for the settlement of the ex-Shah’s estates, which comprise almost the whole province. Pars. 8. In Pars the situation at the moment is quiet. Minor robberies occur in the outlying districts, but the Shiraz-Bushire road seems to be fairly well secured. Opinions as to the possibilities of the situation vary. On the one hand, there are some who profess to anticipate serious tribal trouble in the spring. There are no signs of any possibility of a combined movement by the Arab Khamseh tribes, though hunger may drive them to robbing, and serious trouble could only come from the Qashgai led by Nasir. There is little doubt that Nasir is trying to establish himself as recognised head of the tribe, but there is no evidence yet that the main sub-tribes—the Darashuri, Farsimaidan, Shishbuluki and Kashquli—have any desire to put themselves under his leadership. Nasir is, however, being exhorted by political intriguers, with no particular object except to trouble the waters, to follow the patriotic traditions of his father. On the other hand, a fairly reliable informant with an extensive knowledge of the tribes says that on the whole there is no desire to make trouble. The whole tribe has suffered greatly in recent years from rapacious officials. In spite of attempts to make it settle, it is still almost entirely nomadic. Given decent conditions, numbers would be prepared to settle. The main sub-tribes have no desire to combine again under one leadership. Hunger may drive some to robbery, but, given reasonable freedom from extortion and an opportunity to redevelop their greatly depleted flocks, the tribe, in the opinion of this informant, is not likely to cause trouble. More food seems to be here, as elsewhere in Persia, | the first essential of stable conditions. Kurdistan. 9. The Russian attitude towards the Kurds has thrown the Persian Government into confusion as regards the policy they should themselves adopt. Events at Urumieh and a report, which they are convinced is correct, that six+ &amp;Kc#JLJ CcAA/tfle, * U$Q\JL r&amp;t' hy . Russian officials recently visited Saqqiz and told a gathering of Kurds that any attempt by Persian forces to advance to Saqqiz should be resisted has convinced the War Office that the attempt to re-establish Government authority in Saqqiz and northwards would meet with serious opposition stiffened by the Russians. Jt does seem unlikely that any settlement of the Kurdish question is possible while Russians encourage Kurdish aspirations. British Interests. 10. The Persian Government has agreed to sell nine Mohawk aircraft for the use of the Government of India. Russian Interests. 11. Information obtained from Persian officers who have returned from imprisonment in Russia is generally to the effect that they were reasonably well treated, but that n.c.os. were given more consideration, taken to films, theatres and lectures, and shown anything that might impress them with the advantages of Soviet rule. The n.c.os. were kept separated from the officers. The particular officers who have been met say that they were not subjected to propaganda. The Chief of the Persian General Staff states that a certain Persian officer who was released some time before the others has now handed in a wireless transmitting set which, he says, was given to him by the Russians for the purpose of transmitting information about British troops and British activities. He had secured his early release by promising to send such information and to apply for appointment to a station where he could collect it. He was to be provided with an operator by the Russians. Another set had been handed in by a n.c.o. who had promised to serve Russian interests. He was to endeavour to return to his unit at Birjand, from where he was to report on British activities. He had been trained in wireless operation. There is nothing inherently improbable in these stories, but they are also the kind of story the Persian likes to tell. The Persian General Staff consider that a large number of these n.c.os. (there were between 2.000 and 3,000) may now be Soviet agents and that there may be many other wireless transmitting sets. 12. Evidence continues to accumulate of the intrigues of Russian agents or political commissars in Azerbaijan, which is now spoken of by Soviet partisans as South Azerbaijan. The situation can now be described as almost out of hand of the Persian Government and it is difficult to see how it is to be re-established. The Russians will not allow adequate Persian forces, nor will they themselves give any support to Persian officials. The attitude of Russian troops is one of non-intervention and it is in other respects correct enough. For example, a mob of rioters in Bihshahr, in Mazanderan, calling themselves Communists, who had attacked the police and suffered some casualties from police retaliation, on appealing to the Russian military commander for support, were told that it was the duty of the police to keep order. In Khorrasan, where the political commissar is inactive, there are as yet no reports of provocative intrigues in the places occupied by Russian troops. Turkish Interests. 13. The Turkish Military Attache expresses considerable anxiety about Russian policy in Azerbaijan, especially as regards the Kurds. French Interests. 14. The French Charge d'Affaires, M. Coiffard, seizing on an incorrect interpretation given by tJhe Prime Minister of the purport of the second annexure to the treaty, in which he erroneously stated that Persia would be required to break off relations only with those countries with which Britain and Russia were at war ? wrote a hasty and hysterical letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and sent copies to the press. The Minister refused to accept the letter and the press were instructed not to publish it. One paper did publish it. The4 letter accused the Government of misleading the Persiap people and of acting against their wishes, which, it claimed, were in favour of maintaining the long standing tradition of Franco-Persian friendship. The free French Committee have dissociated themselves from the sentiments of the letter. ^ The French Charge d'Affaires has been informed by the Persian Governm / ^*iC that he is persona non grata and he is leaving Tehran shortly. M. Coiffar^ s motives were probably to endeavour to arouse public feeling to oppose the expulsion of the Vichy Legation, which he resents all the more since the treaty does not oblige Persia to break off relations with Japan.

The Persian Police were forced to release agitators and even murderers; and the Covernor ^ordered to return their arms to the Kurds.

The second reading of the treaty in the Majlis began on the 25th and will probably be finished on the 26th. Ratification is generally expected. Reports that the Russians have been instigating opposition to the treaty have induced some wavering Deputies to accept it. 2. The Majlis has ratified the Bill amalgamating the Ministry of Commerce with that of Industry and Mines. 3. Economic problems have engaged the press during the last week. The Government has been urged to take steps against profiteering and to control prices. Doubts have been expressed of the wisdom of abolishing Government monopolies. The present rial-sterling rate of exchange, which w T as fixed by decree last October at 140 rials to the pound, has been criticised as being too high, having regard to the amount of sterling the Persian Government is now acquiring, and the Minister of Finance has been obliged to defend it as best he could in the Parliament and the press. 4. Rumours have been current in the city that Tehran is to be reoccupied by British and Russian troops. These probably arise from the arrival in Tehran of detachments of administrative units of British troops in connexion with the evacuation of Poles from Russia. 5. About 100 people from Mazanderan and Gilan have come to Tehran to demand that the Majlis should take steps to return to them the lands of which they were dispossessed by Reza Shah.

He reports that, until the arrival of the Soviet Consul, the attitude of Soviet officials, who were then controlled by General Novikoff, commanding Russian forces in North-West / Persia, was correct and even helpful. Since the consul arrived there has been r26^71 &amp;£Cd. POL. CEP*’ 4 MAh 942 INDIA OFFICE2 continual obstruction on the part of the Soviet officials. Agitators and even murderers arrested by the Persian police have been demanded by the Soviet officials and released by them. The Governor was ordered to return to their owners arms he had taken from Kurds and Assyrians and was forbidden to disarm others coming into the town, as they were “ guests ” of the Russi a^ Russian troops stood by while police and gendarmes were attacked, and in s^^V cases killed. Although the Nijat Committee consists of Kurds, Assyrians and Armenians, he considers that the two latter are receiving more attention from the Russians than the Kurds. The committee was terrorising the inhabitants of Urumieh and was living on robbery. His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz reports that about 1,000 refugees have arrived there from Urumieh. 8. The Chief of the Gendarmerie in Azerbai jan has also arrived in Tehran. He confirmed that Persian Government authority has disappeared from the Khalkhal country. A man called Mohamed Taghi, Amir Ahmadi, the son of the late Amir Ashair of these parts, had set himself up in Hirabad (see Summarv No. 3, paragraph 6). v j The Chief of the Gendarmerie said that he had been forbidden by the Russians to use his force for the collection of revenue, and had been told that he must not retain with his force certain machine guns which he had recovered but must send them to Tehran. Khorassan. 9. In Khorassan a certain Soulat-es-Sultaneh, a Hazara notable, exiled for some years in Pars, has declared himself in opposition to the Persian Government. With about 200-250 followers he has set himself up in Turbat Sheikh Jam, having disarmed the police and gendarmerie, and has issued a printed proclama- tiop in Meshed and elsewhere calling on the people of Khorassan to join him in defending their rights against the Persian Government. The Persian authorities consider his activities are the result of Russian instigation. The War Office do not take him very seriously. The Russian authorities have agreed to their sending troops to Meshed. 10. A raid by Baluchis was made on the village of Qaumabad, 4 miles south-east of Shusp, in which an Indian trader and a Persian colonel, who happened to have halted there, were killed. The robbers carried off sixteen camel- loads of loot. Fars. 11. It was noted in Intelligence Summary No. 2, paragraph 10, that Nasir Qashgai was endeavouring to establish himself as head of the tribe. He has now telegraphed to the press in Tehran that he has been asked by the tribe to represent their claims for— (i) Compensation for their sufferings and losses of the last twenty years. (ii) The right to elect a Deputy of their own. (iii) A revision of taxation. Kurdistan and Kermanshah. 12. Severe winter conditions have limited activities of all concerned in these areas. Polish Interests. 13. The Persian Government had been informed of the intention to evacuate a number of Poles through Persia and, not unexpectedly, this was soon publicly known. Questions were asked in the Majlis to which indefinite answers were given, but a day or so later a statement appeared in the press that 25,000 Poles, who were not required in Russia, were to be evacuated through Persia to the Mid-East. 14. There is as yet no indication from the Soviet authorities as to when these Poles may be expected to arrive, nor have they yet signified their acceptance v of the proposals regarding the routes of their arrival.3 French Interests. I*-*- General de (jraulle has appointed M. Andre Godard (Director of Archaeological Services of the Persian Government) to be delegate for Persia of ‘''.-''the Comite national fran^ais. For some time Free French interests in Persia ^ ave been in the hands of a committee presided over by M. Goblot. This committee remains in being. 16. General Catroux has appointed Chef d’Escadron Jouvel, who has for some time been engaged in business in Tehran, to be his military representative m Persia. 17. M. Coiffard, Vichy French Charge d’Affaires, has left Persia (see Summary No. 3, paragraph 14). Russian Interests. 18.

The Treaty was approved by the Majlis on the 26 th January. By the middle of February, criticism of the Cabinet was increasing. Troops sent to Meshed for the suppression of Soulat-es-Sultanah had dispersed the rebels and Soulat-es-Sultanah was in hiding. (He has since surrendered to the Government forces). The Kurds had recaptured Saqqiz and were believed by the Persian authorities to have Russian sympathy, if not actual encouragement. At the end of January, hold-ups occurred on the Kerman-Zahidan and Isfahan-Shiraz roads, but in Kermanshah General Shahbakhti had received the submission of the tribal leaders and the surrender of loot.

THE treaty was approved by the Majlis on the 26th January. Of those members present 80 voted for the treaty, 5 against and 8 abstained. It was signed on the 29th January. It would perhaps not be wise to accept this as a measure of its popularity. While generally the older educated classes, though regretting their eviction from their seats on the fence are prepared to accept the treaty as the less unpleasant alternative, and as at least giving them some ground on which to stand in their relations with Russia, the mass of the people are still fearful that the result will be to bring Persia into the war. They are not impressed by the Allies’ preparations to carry out article 3 (1) whereby they undertake to protect Persia against all aggression. An improvement in economic conditions, if that could be shown to be due to Allied help, would, however, quickly i change the sentiments of the poorer classes. It is regrettable, though not strange, that Great Britain should be so unpopular among them. Scarcity, high prices, insecurity, the continuance of maladministration and the spread of Bolshevik ideas are all held to be, in varying degrees, the result of British actions. A note struck by the press is that public opinion about the treaty will depend on the nature of the aid given to Persia under article 7. The Prime Minister in his speech at the dinner given by the Persian Government to celebrate the signing of the treaty said that the collabora tion of America in the common cause of the Allies gave him grounds for confidence in the treaty. The press says that Persia, having adhered to the Atlantic Charter, now looks to America for support and assistance. 2. It is to be hoped that now that the treaty, which has been the cause of so much anxiety to the Persian Government is out of the way, attention will be given to urgent problems of administration. A Bill has been drafted to regulate the disposal of the lands of the ex-Shah, and the Ministry of Justice is now engaged in drafting a Bill to prevent hoarding and profiteering. Public markets for food stuffs and fuel have been opened in Tehran undbr official control with a view to eliminating the middleman. 3. A Bill has been laid before the Majlis to authorise the payment to the dependants of Persian officers and other ranks, who were killed in August, of pensions equal to the pay drawn by the deceased at the time he was killed. The existing law allows only a very meagre pension. [27-4] RECd. POL. DEPt. i 6 MAR 1942 INDIA OFFICE2 \\b% llV^ Officials. 4.

He reports that order has been completely restored by the Soviet military authorities, but that neither Persian officials nor the police and gendarmerie were functioning. The Kurds, he thought, were not giving much trouble in Urumieh itself, but were practically independent in their own districts. 6. The Soviet authorities have agreed to Persian troops being sent to Ardebil for operations for the pacification of the Khalkhal country. (See Summary No. 4, paragraph 8.) — Khorassan. 7. A column of Persian troops consisting of two battalions of infantry, four tanks and a battery of field guns left Tehran for Meshed where they are due on the 2nd February for the suppression of Soulat-es-Sultanah j'see Summary No. 4, paragraph 9). They are to be joined at Meshed by two squadrons of cavalry from Birjand. Soulat-es-Sultaneh has retired to Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. It is not expected that he will make any serious resistance. The troops mentioned above are to stay in Meshed. 8. Soulat-es-Sultaneh’s outbreak led to some disorder in Khorassan. There were many unfounded rumours and some brigandage, some rioting in Turbat-i-Haidari, and wheat that had been purchased for the labourers by^ con tractors employed on the maintenance of the Nokkundi-Meshed road had been looted and lorries carrying wheat prevented from leaving the town. The removal of wheat from any area in the present conditions of shortage and high prices is always liable to cause indignation, particularly if there is suspicion, as in this case, that it is being bought for the British. 9. There was a further raid by Baluchis on a small village in the neighbour hood of Qiamabad (see Summary No. 4, paragraph 10). There is as yet no South Persia. 10. Hold ups occurred on the Kerman-Zahidan and Isfahan-Shiraz roads. In the first case some lorries carrying the post were looted by raiders, probably Persian Baluchis, 80 miles west of Bam. In the second, Mr. Winsor, the American irrigation expert, was looted 60 miles north of Shiraz. The band alleged to have committed this robbery, twelve in number, has been captured and taken in to Shiraz. 11. Operations have been initiated for the restoration of Persian Govern ment authority in Dashti and for the collection of arms. A column of Persian troops has reached Khormuj, 40 miles south-east of Bushire. Kurdistan. 12. Certain sections of the Qalbaghi had already submitted, and the resistance of the remainder of this troublesome tribe has probably been broken by the capture of 150 of them by Persian troops. Arms are now being collected. Mohamed Rashid has not been heard of for some time and is said to be ill. There seems at the moment to be little obstacle to an advance on Saggiz^ by Persian troops except their own fears of Russian support of the Kurds and perhaps the snow. , Cjkelt Kermanshah. 13. An advance by Persian columns against the Kakavand and Ahmadawand led, according to the statement of the Persian military commander.3 to the submission of the tribal leaders and the surrender of loot and some 400 rifles. Demonstrations against the Kalkhanis have brought about a humble attitude in this tribe, 'these events may be taken as indicating that General Shahbakhti is succeeding in instilling some respect, if not for the Persian Government at least for himself, and also that the morale of Persian troops is not quite so bad as it was. Russian Interests. 14. I he improved conditions at Urumieh due, according to His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz, to action by Russian authorities, the permission given to Persian troops to pass through the Russian garrisons on the Tehran-Meshed Road on their way to operate against Soulat-es-Sultaneh (see paragraph 7) and to move into hastern Azerbaijan to operate against the Khalkhal insurgents, and the encouragement given by the Soviet Ambassador to proposals made by the Persian authorities for the suppression of this disturbance, may indicate that representa tions recently made to the Soviet Government by His Majesty’s Government have been effective in securing a modification of unofficial Soviet policy in Persia. 15. A note on information given by Miss Eve Curie on her return from a visit to Russia is attached as an appendix. 16. The Soviet authorities show such anxiety to send staffs and detachments to the Persian Gulf for the purpose of taking over American lorries and aircraft there rather than in places further north, such as Tehran and Kazvin, that it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that they regard it as the first step towards the realisation of a long-dreamt dream. Russian Troops. 17. His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz estimated that the number of Russian troops in Urumieh was about 2,000, mostly cavalry. There were also garrisons of unknown strength at Khoi, Maku and Oilman’and posts along the Turkish frontier as far south as Ushnu. Tehran, February 3, 1942. Appendix. Miss EVE CURIE returned from Russia on the 30th January after a visit of about three weeks. She is a shrewd and competent observer. She was specially favoured in Russia, visited Moscow and four different parts of the front, including Mojaisk, which she reached three days after the Russians entered it! She was greatly impressed by the Russian army, its healthiness, physique, morale and equipment. It was incomparably better fed and clothed than the civilian population. The latter, however, seemed happy to be sacrificed so that the army should be well found. The high state of organisation and discipline of the army was in noticeable contrast to the apparent sloppiness and casualness in the civilian population. Russian officers (she mentioned especially Voissoff and Govaroff who recaptured Mojaisk), although certain of a German counter offensive in the spring, were not merely confident, but arrogant; they would defeat the Germans in a year. British and American aid they refused to' discuss, except to say that the only effective aid was the establishment of a second front on the continent. Libya they belittled. As regards aid in munitions, there was a conventional reply, apparently inspired : ‘ c We have promises and we hope they will be fulfilled.’' When Miss Curie mentioned to one senior officer that she had come to Russia largely to write up British and American supplies, he replied : “ Say nothing about it; if you speak the truth it will encourage the Germans.” She got the impression that many Russian officers did not appreciate at all the part Great Britain was playing; they seemed to think that they were fighting the Germans alone, and would beat them alone and would then “ settle Europe.”4 She was struck by the quantities of equipment of all kinds with the Russian army, but saw very little British or American. She saw some German prisoners, miserably clad, underfed and frostbitten, but they may have been selected for her. All the inhabitants of recaptured towns and villages were boiling with hatred against the Germans, and all had ugly tales of German cruelties and atrocities. Her outstanding impression was of a people fanatically and austerely determined to defend their country, even though at best life in that country harsh and gave them little. Nationalism rather than communism was uxie inspiration./4. (11814) \Yt.29201/P.295 2,000 9/39 A.&amp; E.AY.Ltd. Gp.685 3&lt;50 CONFIDENTIAL. EXTERNAL SECRET. Political Department. NOTES FOR REGISTRY.

The most pressing grievances were distribution of food stocks and restoration of exappropriated lands. 2. Economic. There was agitation against the existing rate of 140 rials to the pound sterling, which.it was argued, was too high. In this connection it is interesting to note that the Khorassan Commercial Diary for January gives a black rate of r£als 165 to the pound sterling. 3. Persian Forces. Minor successes in Khorassan, Dashti, etc., had done a little to raise the morale of the Persian Army.- The General Staff had drawn up a scheme for reorganisation (see Section 4 of Summary 9).4. : Security. Gleaning-up operations were in progress in Khorassan (Soulat-es-S^ultaneh has since surrendered). Conditions had improved in Azerbaijan, where Rezaieh and Sauj B0ulagh were reported to he calm. It was hoped that the Russians would allow Persian troops to he sent to Urumieh. 5. Russian interests. A hundred Russian soldiers had heen sent to Bushire on the pretext of taking over American lorries for delivery to Russia. The Persiap^iuthorities showed much concern at thispmsslan penetration to the Persian Gulf. ft. For information fP7/ file copy THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJ rjy / &amp; PERSIA.

QvAaajbjilo uM Persian Affairs. Political and Economic. THE treaty appears to be gaining increasing support, largely because it is coming to be regarded as some safeguard against Russia, a view which finds encouragement in an apparent modification of the Russian attitude since it came into force. There are, however, probably few Ministers or officials who are not concerned with preparing the best possible case for themselves in case the Germans should reach Persia. 2. The press has published articles almost fulsome in their appreciation of Soviet policy towards Persia, so different from that of Tsarist Russia. Coupled with this praise is a violent denunciation of those who have tried to arouse ill-feeling and suspicion among the Persian people as regards Soviet intentions by creating trouble and disturbances in the provinces occupied by the Red Army. The correct behaviour of the Soviet troops is very pointedly stressed, and it is plain that the denunciation is addressed to Soviet political agitators. 3. Economic problems, the distress of the poorer classes and the iniquities of officials are the subject of many articles in the press. A number of new papers have appeared, mostly distinctly Left in tone. 4. The Shah has laid the first stone of a new suburb that is to be built on the site of the village of Nazabad, south of Tehran. A thousand small houses are to be built, principally for the working classes, at a cost of 85 million rials to relieve the congestion in Tehran and to reduce house-rents, which are now very high for the poorer classes. 5. The press has announced that the ex-Shah is to go to Canada, 6. The Minister of Ways and Communications gave an interview to the press for the purpose of allaying public anxiety regarding the cost of improve ments in communications now in progress and alleged to be projected. He said that it was intended to continue the construction of the unfinished lines from Tehran to Tabriz, Meshed and Yezd and to construct a line from Khorramshahr to Ahwaz, but that there was no intention to build a line from Kazvin to Khanakin. The improvements now being made to certain roads for the transport of supplies to Russia would be paid for by the Allies, as would be the cost of the railway from Khorramshahr to Ahwaz. The Allies were also paying for all goods transported by rail at ordinary tariff rates. The transport of 'merchandise and munitions by rail was controlled by a joint Anglo-Soviet-Persian Commission..

The Persian authorities had previously announced the appointment of a Kurdish notable, Saifullah Khan Ardalan, as Governor of Saggiz and it is^ understood that, previous to the advance of the troops, he had entered into son. negotiations with the Kurds. Saifullah Khan is a son of the late Hussain Khan, Muzaffer-es-Sultaneh, and nephew of Sardar Rashid, who was imprisoned in Tehran by Reza Shah. He is also his stepson, as Sardar Rashid married his brother’s widow. 8. In addition to Saifullah Khan, other Kurds are also exercising authority on behalf of the Persian Government. Mahmud Kanisanau was some time ago appointed Governor of Merivan; Qazi Mohamed continues to function in Sauj Bulagh with the nominal approval of the Persian Government, and Amir Azad is said to have been asked to undertake responsibility for the Mamish tribe. Haji Baba Sheikh, who has political and religious influence in the country west of Saggiz-Sauj Bulagh, and who was one of the Kurdish notables taken to Baku by the Russians, has arrived in Tabriz and has telegraphed to the Minister of the Interior to the effect that he wishes to visit him and offer his services. Other attempts by the Persian Government to give authority to Kurdish chiefs have been nullified by local jealousies. 9. Much has been heard recently of the grievances of the Persian Kurds. The more obvious of these date back for some fifteen years. Previous to that the grievances were rather against the Kurds—at least certain tribes who had been for generations the scourge of the countryside. The real grievances of the Persian Kurds to-day are for the most part those common to all Persian subjects who have suffered from the tyranny and corruption of officials and the general over taxation of recent years. For those they may, in common with other Persian subjects, legitimately demand redress. But the Kurd has also regarded it as a grievance that he should be required to pay revenue, be subject to conscription and be prevented from smuggling and illicit trading. Although there may be arguments for preferential treatment of the Kurds in some respects, as there may be for special policies in certain other parts of Persia, to make obvious exceptions in the case of the Kurds would lead to an outcry for similar treatment from all other tribes and self-styled minorities. Kermanshah. 10. There is considerable improvement in security in this province, the more troublesome tribes—the Kakavand, Ahmadavand and Khalkhanis—having come to heel. The general officer commanding states that rifles are being collected in satisfactory numbers. He considers the situation sufficiently settled to justify his coming to Tehran for “ medical treatment.” The real reason is probably to see what his rival for the dictatorship of Persia, Sipahbod Ahmadi, the Minister of the Interior, is doing. A zerbaijan. 11. Further details have been received from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz of the situation at Urumieh and in the district. In the town order was maintained by Russian patrols; the Nijat Committee had dispersed or gone to ground; there was little evidence of Persian authority or administration and, apart from keeping- order, Russian officials did not concern themselves with the administration. The police and gendarmerie, in too-small numbers to be effective, were entirely demoralised. In the district there were no evidences of Government authority; there were no gendarmes outside the towns; the landlords did not dare to go to their villages to collect their dues; sowing was at least 25 per cent, short of normal. A “no-tax” campaign is in full swing. While these conditions are to a large extent due to Persian maladministration, they are difficult to remedy while the Russians impose an inadequate limitation on the number of police and gendarmerie that may be maintained and at the same time covertly encourage the lower classes in their revolt against the landlords and officials. The Soviet authorities still refuse to allow Persian troops to be sent to Urumieh.3 Mazanderan. 12. The Russians agreed to reinforcements of gendarmerie being sent to ^Southern Mazanderan to deal with disturbances in the Sang-i-Sar region (see Summary No. 2, paragraph 9). The Minister of the Interior states that the situation has much improved and that some of the worst brigands have been ■caught. A horassan. 13. The column mentioned in Summary No. 5, paragraph 7, encountered the rebels before they reached Meshed. This band was dispersed with some casualties. The rebels have retired to Fariman, on the Meshed-Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam road, and were, according to the latest reports received, still holding a strong post on the Meshed-Turbat-i-Haidari road. There had been disturbances in the latter place. The Persian forces were to operate first against Fariman and then to clean up the area around Turbat-i-Haidari. Their casualties are said to have amounted to twenty-five killed and wounded. An engineer recently arrived from Turbat-i-Haidari states that Soulat’s forces are not molesting the labourers working on the Meshed-Zahidan road-improvement scheme, but says that the general unsettled state of the locality has brought into being brigands, who, while owing no allegiance to Soulat. are a menace to security. Simultaneously with the insurrection of Soulat-es-Sultaneh in North-East Khorassan, there was an outbreak on the part of the Kurdish tribes who have been settled in Northern Khorassan since the time of Shah Abbas. They raided Kuchan, although there are Russian troops there, Bujnurd and Shirvan. The Persian General Staff says they withdrew when Persian troops moved to Meshed. Dashti. 14. It is reported from a consular source that at Khormuz Rais Ghulam Razmi (one of the two important khans, the other being Ali Ismail) has come to terms with the Persian military forces and that the lesser chiefs have followed his example and that no serious opposition is expected until the military come into contact with Ali Ismail, whose forces are said to be based on Dayir. The indications are that he, too, may come to terms. Persian Army. 15. Ihe latest (the 6th February, 1942) distribution of the Tehran garrison is as follows :— 1J regiments on local guards. 1 battalion as additional police in the town. 2 battalions at Meshed. 2 battalions standing by for operations in the Khalkhal area (80 miles south-east of Tabriz). According to the Persian D.C.G.S., this leaves little infantry in the capital except recruits. (Note.— The third battalion in each infantry regiment consists of recruits.) .1 appointments — Military. 16. —-(i) Colonel Muhammad Nakhchevan to be promoted general and to command the military forces of Ustan No. 9 (Khorassan).

The evacuation of 25,000 Poles for Mid-East and the United Kingdom appears to be hanging fire. The Soviet authorities in Moscow say they are waiting for information from the Soviet Ambassador in Tehran. The latter.wlho is fully informed of the British-Polish plans, states that he has not been informed by Moscow that any Poles were to be evacuated. The plans are ready to be put into execution. R ussian Interests. 18. The Soviet Ambassador has been instructed to negotiate with tb'-'^ Persian Government for the purchase of the machinery of the uncompleted Breii machine-gun factory in Tehran. The Government of India originally hoped to buy this machinery, but it was agreed between London and Moscow that the factory should be completed in Tehran, if the missing machinery, which was mostly in Russia, could be found, and that Russia should take the production. The Soviet authorities have now realised that the factory cannot be put into production in Tehran.FILE CO THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 6f Hlf RRITAI jy iktCus PERSIA.

Persian A ffairs. Criticism of the Cabinet is increasing. This is due partly to genuine dissatisfaction at their apparent dilatoriness in dealing with economic and administrative problems and partly to the inspiration of candidates for ministerial posts. It is probable that there will be some changes, but supporters of British policy hold the opinion that it would be a political mistake to allow the Prime Minister to resign at present. Four men only find support as possible successors: Taqizadeh, now Minister in London; Tadayyun, the present Minister of Education; Qavam-es-Sultaneh, previously several times Prime Minister; and Seyyed Zia, who carried through the couf d'Ftat of 1921 that brought Reza Khan to power, now in Palestine. 2. The Royal Family. Queen Fawzieh is leaving Tehran by air to pay a visit to her brother the King of Egypt. The Persian press states that the visit is strictly private and will be of not more than one month’s duration. 3. Perso-Soviet Relations. In an article dated the 11th February, 1942, on the internal situation and the disturbances in Azerbaijan, the Journal de Tehran asks why the Persian Government cannot take more vigorous steps to quell the unrest. “ We know,” says the article, “ that the Red Army gives proof of its good intentions to collaborate effectively.” “ Why then does the Persian Government hesitate to send troops to the disturbed areas ? ’ ’ This is a covert dig at the recent refusal by the Soviets to allow Persian troops to re-enter Urumieh. 4. Economics — Live-stock. (i) The numbers of existing live-stock in Persia is estimated Ministry of Agriculture at:— Sheep 16,500,000 Goats 8.600,000 Cattle 2,200.000 (ii) The official figures for exports for Goat skins Sheep skins ... Lamb skins ... Goat and sheep casings r 27 — 1940-41 are as follows :— 52,460 pieces 17,700 pieces 15,600 pieces 3,535 kilog. by the'2 No £ Set (iii) In 1942 the export of live-stock was forbidden by the Government, but the Persian Government admit that many head of cattle have been illegally exported to Iraq and also to the U.S.S.R. The number of cattle taken over the northern frontier to Russia is said to have reached 200 weekly. This has been the subject of protest by the Persian Government to the Soviet Government both in Tehran and in Moscow. 5. Personalities. The death on the 14th February is announced of Daud Miftah (170) (125). Sartip Amini, commanding in Kurdistan, has been killed by the rebels in Saqqiz. Internal Security. 6. Khorassan (see 'paragraph 13 0 / Summary No. 6). The Persian Government forces have cleared up Turbat-i-Haidari, Fariman and Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. The Meshed-Birjand road is now open. Soulat- us-Sultaneh has fled and is in hiding near Kalat-i-Nadiri. The rebels have dispersed. The Afghan Government is co-operating by preventing the entry of Soulat-us-Sultaneh into their territory. Some arms are being collected. The prompt action of the Persian Government in this matter, having had no forces in Khorassan when the rebellion broke out, has had a good effect. 7. Kurdistan (see paragraph 7 of Summary No. 6). The Kurdish rebels have retaken Saqqiz, killed Sartip Amini, the local commander, and destroyed and dispersed the entire small force he had taken with him, none of which has as yet returned to headquarters. This reverse for the Government will, it is feared, encourage Kurdish resistance. It has also served to strengthen the belief of the Persian authorities that the Kurds are counting on Russian sympathy if not getting Russian encouragement. They consider that the refusal of the Soviet authorities to allow Persian troops in Urumieh must be taken by the Kurds as evidence of Russian sympathy. It is unlikely that any attempt to reoccupy Saqqiz or to undertake any serious operations against the Kurds will be made for some time. Indeed, the Persian Government has not the number of troops necessary with one column operating in Khorassan and another moving shortly to Eastern Azerbaijan. In Southern Kurdistan (adjoining Luristan) the collection of arms is proceeding in and around Harsin. 8. Gendarmerie. A detail of the strength of the gendarmerie as it was on the 14th February is attached as an appendix. British Interests. 9. There is some propaganda in Tehran, encouraged probably by the Japanese Legation, to the effect that Anglo-Russian relations are bad, and it finds some measure of belief. Russian officials are said to be openly criticising the British for their poor defence of Singapore. The Turkish Embassy is watching with close attention for evidence of Anglo-Russian disagreements. 10. Sir Oliver Lyttelton, British Minister of State in the Middle East, visited TeEran from the 9th to 13th February. Russian Interests. 11. Russian Troops in Mazanderan and Gilan. Recent travellers in the area Pahlevi-Gorgon have given the following as their impressions of Russian forces in this area :— (a) General .—There are no mechanised or armoured forces in this area. Intensive elementary training is being carried out from early morning until late at night.x 3 All military stations, depots and premises were very heavily guarded. Transport markings as follows :— (i) 4-figure numbers (or two sets of two figures), all commencing 54 or 45. i.e., 5467. 4592. (ii) D plus 3-figure numbers. Two types of men were seen :— (i) Very young recruits—boys of about 16 being common. (ii) Stiffening of older men, many dressed in clothing suggestive of having come from a much colder area; it may be that the area is used for rest. A report was received that the area commander at Shahi was Major Zelinovsky. All attempts to check this failed. Babul Sar is definitely a general hospital and convalescent area. Isolated sentries seen on coast road looking out to sea, coast-watching. Generally speaking, officers are prepared to join in drinking parties, but one or two always remain completely sober and control conduct of remainder. Suggested that extensive training in guerrilla warfare is being carried out in Mazanderan, where the country is very suitable for this. Equipment (parties of about forty) : 2/4 mortars, varying numbers of automatic weapons, dummy hand grenades, &amp;c. The Russian troops are paying cash for all purchases and there are no complaints of their treatment of locals. All amusements provided for troops are entirely self-contained and no encouragement is given to mix with troops. Locals are not allowed to attend military entertainments. No surface propaganda—the suggestion being that the Russians hope for a gradual collapse entailing intervention, which would strengthen any post-war claims to control a community incapable of conducting its own affairs. Local relations : nil. (b) Identifications. —Identifications : nil. Security is obviously an integral part of training. (c) Locations. Pahlevi : Two companies, guarding docks. Naushahr: Battalion headquarters, guarding docks. Naval W/T station. Babul Sar : One cavalry regiment. Shahi : Base sub-area. Headquarters, infantry regiment (three battalions).

The Government. Agitation for changes in the Cabinet has continued throughout the week It is directed mainly against the Minister of the Interior, Sipahbod Ahmadi, who was one of Reza Shah’s most effective lieutenants and amassed considerable wealth during his reign—a ruthless, energetic man who has little patience with parliaments and democracy, the most forceful character in the Cabinet. Attacks are also being made on the Minister of Ways and Communications, General Jahanbani, who has co-operated well with the Transportation Directorate, and on Dr. Nafisi, the Minister of Finance, an honest and hard-working Minister, liie Prime Minister s position seems secure for the time being, as his most serious rival, Qavam-es-Sultaneh, after months of laborious intrigue to create for “If a party in the Majlis, has written to the press saying that rumours to the effect that he desired to become Prime Minister were baseless, as his health would not allow him to accept the responsibility. The Government’s Bill against hoarding and profiteering has made little progress, owing to the effective delaying tactics adopted bv the Deputies with whom the Bill is not popular, since many of them are both hoarding and profiteering. 2. The Press. The press has been much occupied with demands for reform for the elimination of officials connected with the abuses of Reza Shah’s regime, for the establishment of security and for a reduction in the sterling rate of exchange There has been some argument for foreign advisers in certain departments. Dr. Millspaugh s work coming in for warm praise in one paper. There has been some discreet pro-Ally propaganda and some cautious condemnation of the Axis, but generally the tone of comments about the war has been pessimistic* foretelling a long war. 3.

But there is still a considerable amount of pro-German feeling among the junior officers, and there is little doubt that this is being deliberately kept ali\e and fostered by some agency. The Japanese Legation is certainly implicated. The prestige of British arms does not at present stand high, and the German spring offensive in South Russia is much in mind. The absence of any indications of British preparations for the defence of Persia creates hesitation and anxietv. 5. Appointments. Sartip Ghadar to command the Kurdistan Division, vice Sartip Amini, killed. Sartip Mustafa Assa to be Military Governor of Tehran. Internal Security. 6. When tribal chiefs were released from prison after the abdication of Reza Shah they came to some agreement with each other to form a sort of tribal council, to be headed by Amir Jang Bakhtiari, nominally to represent tribal matters to the Government and offer advice. There is suspicion that the agreement went further than this, and that the chiefs bound themselves to stand together to force the Government to comply with their demands, which would probably be for the restitution of their lands and of some tribal privileges, and in some cases the restoration of their own authority over the tribes, in effect tantamount to some measure of tribal autonomy. The principal chiefs concerned are said to be Nasir Qashgai, some Bakhtiari and Kurdish chiefs. It is fairly reliably reported that sealed Qorans have recently been passing among the tribal leaders. While a concerted move by the tribes may not be likely owing to the chiefs’ distrust of each other, it could cause the Persian Government very serious embarrassment. For that reason, and on account of the lack of mobility of their forces due to shortage of transport, the General Staff feels obliged to have forces on the spot in any area where there might be trouble. 7. Khorassan. Order has effectively been restored around Meshed and on the southern road as far as Turbat-i-Haidari. Soulat-es-Sultaneh, when last heard of, was making for Kalat-i-Kadiri with some following. If he succeeds in reaching that old stronghold there will be some difficulty in dislodging him. The abortive rising of the Khorassan Kurds around Quchan and Bujnurd, which was apparently meant to synchronise with Soulat-es-Sultaneh’s rebellion, seems to have fizzled out. 8. Azerbaijan. Conditions in Azerbaijan have generally improved. The gendarmerie have carried out successful operations against the Khalkhal rebels and have killed their leader, Taqi, Amir Ahmadi. Less is heard of Soviet propaganda, Kurdish Azerbaijan is quiet and Kurds are no longer allowed to carry arms in Tabriz. But the local Soviet authorities still refuse to allow Persian troops in Urumieh (Rezaieh). It remains to be seen whether they will agree to the increase of gendarmerie and police up to the limits thought desirable by the Persian Govern ment. as the Russian Ambassador in London states they have been instructed to do. 9. Khuzistan. A gang of Bahmai tribesmen who had been creating trouble in the Haft Khel area has been dispersed and the leader captured by a force of gendarmerie. This outbreak may be connected with reports received from Isfahan of the activities of a young Bakhtiari Khan, Nadir Quli, son of Sardar Ashjaa, a reputed hothead of little importance, who is said to have left for Malamir with the intention of raising a band for the sabotage of the oil-fields. Whether that is his intention or not, reliable opinion is that he is not likely to acquire much support. 10. Fars. . . Operations in Dashti are not yet completed, Ah Ismail not yet having submitted nor, as far as is known, has any action been taken against him at Daiynx unconfirmed re p ort f rom Shiraz says that a large force of Buvair Ahmadi tribesmen has collected in Ardakan and has attacked and disarmed a military post at Tal Khosrovi (^-inch map, sheet H.39.J).

IN a secret session of the Majlis the Prime Minister was given a personal vote of confidence which did not extend to his Cabinet. The other Ministers resigned on the 26th February. The new Cabinet was announced on the 2nd March and was as follows :— Prime Minister and Minister for War: Muhammad Ali Faroughi (7!) (88). - . .. . ^ Agriculture, Food Supplies and Economics : Abdul Majid Ahi (5) (7). Health: Ali Ashgar Hikmat (85) (111). Posts and Telegraphs : Hasan Ali Hidayet. Foreign Affairs : Ali Soheili (203) (283). Interior : Baqir Kazemi (105) (142). Finance : Yadullah Azudi (39) (49). Communications : General Amanullah Jehanbani (100) (132). Industry : Abdul Hussein Hajir (80) (104). Justice : Gulshayan. Education : Mustafa Adi (1) (1). (The first figures refer to Foreign Office Personalities and the second to military attache’s.) They resigned en bloc some hours later. It is to be hoped that a new Government can speedily be appointed which will have some stability, and that Ministers will remain in office long enough to carry through some of the talked-of and much-needed reforms. The most prominent causes of unrest, which, unless remedied, may lead to serious trouble, are hunger and the demand for restoration of expropriated lands. The most critical °and urgent problems before the Government are to ensure a fairer distribution of food-stuffs and to give concrete evidence that the matter of restoration of lands is really under way. It has been decided to hold one secret session of the Majlis each week at which Under-Secretaries of Ministries will attend. 2. Legislation. The law of the 25th Dalve, 1303, has been annulled. The law in question read as follows :— ££ Single Article. —The National Assembly confers on Aqai Riza Khan Sardar Sipah supreme command of the nation’s defence and security [27—94] RECd. POL.DEPt. -8 PR .94? IND!* r TFICE2 (Amnieh) forces, and he will carry out his duties with full powers within the limits of the fundamental law and the laws of the land; this position cannot be taken from him without the approval of the National Assembly.” The intention of the annulment is to vest the control of the army in the Ministry of War, which is, in turn, responsible to the Majlis. — 3. Economic. There is strong agitation against the maintenance of the present rate of the rial-sterling exchange (140 rials to the £ sterling). Some demand the abolition of control, which, it is claimed, would result in a very considerable cheapening of sterling; others put forward more reasoned arguments to show that a rate between 100-120 should be adopted and control maintained. The Minister of Finance, in defence of the present rate and in answer to criticisms that Persia was getting flooded with unnecessary sterling and consequently need not pay so high a price for it, stated that he expected to have to import during the year 1942-43 wheat to the value of £2 million, sugar and piece-goods each to a similar value, and motor vehicles, tyres and spares to the value of £4 million; in other words, so far from sterling being a drug in the Persian market, it is more necessary than ever in order to obtain essential imports, including food It is anticipated that the current financial year will close with a much smaller deficit (about 400 million rials) than was at first estimated. For the coming year expenditure is estimated at 3,000 million rials, revenue at something less; but the budget excludes all capital expenditure, which it is hoped to meet by a loan. Persian Forces. 4. The Persian General Staff has now drawn up a scheme for the reorganisation of the Persian army. It allows for eight divisions (seven of which have three brigades and one two brigades) and one independent brigade. Each brigade consists of one infantry regiment, one squadron of cavalry and one battery of artillery. The location is as follows :— Tehran— 2 divisions, each with a brigade detached, one to Resht and one to the South-East Caspian. Azerbaijan— Divisional Headquarters and 1 brigade, Tabriz. 1 brigade, Ardebil. 1 brigade, Rezaieh Kurdistan and Kermanshah— Divisional Headquarters and 1 brigade, Kermanshah. 1 brigade, Senneh. 1 brigade, Saqqiz and Iraqi frontier. Lurestan and Khuzistan— 1 brigade, Lurestan. 1 brigade, Khuzistan. Pars— Divisional Headquarters and 1 brigade, Shiraz. 1 brigade, Kazarun area. 1 brigade, Jahrum area. Kerman and Persian Baluchistan— Divisional Headquarters and 1 brigade, Kerman. 1 brigade, Khwash. 1 brigade, Seistan. Khorassan— Divisional Headquarters and 1 brigade, Meshed. 1 brigade, Afghan frontier. 1 brigade, Bujnurd. Isfahan— 1 brigade.J he total strength, including recruits and services, is 86,000. The cost is nearly 900 million rials. The Minister of Finance has, however, budgeted for 600 million rials only, and if this is maintained, as is probable, the strength will have to be reduced to between 50,000 and 60,000. It is not yet known what l^iumbers the Russians will accept in their areas. The Soviet Government has ^^cepted in principle the right of the Persian Government to locate their troops as necessary for the maintenance of security. A governing factor in the strength and dispositions of the Persian forces is its lack of transport and consequent loss of mobility. A War Office commission is now visiting the Fars and Kerman Divisions to initiate the new organisation. Conscription is to be maintained for the present as higher pay than can be afforded would have to be offered to secure voluntary recruits. There is , considerable public feeling against conscription, which is, however, not likely to find effective expression until security is on a firmer basis than at present. There is general anxiety about the spring, when it is feared there may be tribal unrest leading at least to brigandage. If the authority of the Central Government is re-established and order restored, then the opposition to conscription and the demand for the reduction of the army to the minimum essential will probably be more plainly heard. Meanwhile, efforts are being made by the War Office to eliminate the worst abuses of conscription. Theoretically, it has been removed from the control of divisional commanders, to whom it was a considerable source of profit, and is now controlled by an independent commission. The main lines of military policy are directed by the Higher Military Council, which meets twice a week and is usually presided over by the Shah himself. It consists of the Minister for War, the Chief of the General Staff, the three army inspectors (Generals Shahbakhte, Ahmadi and Jahanbani) and the financial officer of the War Office. Colonel Alai. The Minister for War and the Chief of Staff visit the Shah almost daily. A column of Persian troops left Tehran on the 21st February under the command of Colonel Ahmad Janpulad, for the Khalkhal countrv (Eastern Azerbaijan). Small columns have also visited Quchan and Bujnurd. The column consisted of two battalions of infantry and a battery of artillery. Internal Security. 5. Khorassan. Minor cleaning-up operations are in progress in Northern Khorassan, but Soulat-es-Sultaneh has not yet been captured. Farajollah Picharanlou, the leader of the Kurds of the Bujnurd-Quchan area, who had raised an incipient revolt, has submitted to a column of Persian troops which had been detached from the forces at Meshed. This operation was not objected to by the Russians, although it is well inside the area occupied by their troops. 6. Azerbaijan. The despatch of Persian troops to Eastern Azerbaijan (see paragraph 4 above) should have a good effect on that part of the province, and should prove a discouragement to those secessionists who were claiming to have Soviet support. If the Soviet authorities agree to the despatch of Persian troops to Urumieh (Rezaieh), Kurdish pretensions to Soviet support will lose much force. The situation at Rezaieh and Sauj Bulagh is now reported to be calm, largely due to the influence of Qazi Mohamed (see Summary No. 6, paragraph 8). 7. Khuzistan. The Bani Turuf threatened a revolt to recover lands of which they had been deprived in Reza Shah’s reign. The disturbance was, however, quickly quietened by the prompt action of the Persian authorities without fighting as far as is known at present. Russian Affairs. 8. A party of four Russian military officers, accompanied by some non-commissioned officers, has reached Bandar Abbas after visiting other places in South-East Persia. Their nominal object is to advise on measures for the suppression of locusts. One hundred Russian soldiers, accompanied by eight4 officers, have gone to Bushire. The pretext here was to take over American lorries for delivery to Russia. Although the Soviet authorities weie well aware of the fact that these lorries were to be delivered at Tehran by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and that all arrangements had been made to that end, their military authorities insisted on sending the party. The firs* convoy, consisting of some sixty lorries, is now on its way from Bushire to lehraJ^^ Other Russian detachments will shortly be going to Abadan and Andimeshk foi the purpose of taking over aircraft and lorries. This Russian penetration to tile Persian Gulf is a matter of much concern to the Persian authorities, who are surprised that the British authorities should allow it. 9. The following, reference Russian forces in Persia, has been supplied by the Way Mission, to whom it was given by Soviet authorities in Tiflis :— Tabriz— Headquarters, Cavalry Corps. 2 cavalry regiments, both with headquarters at Urmia. Khoi and Maku— Infantry regiment, plus three batteries of artillery in each place. Ushnu, Maracheh, Nianek, Zinjan and Kazyin— 1 cavalry squadron, additional to 2 regiments.

THE crisis continued till the 9th March. One cannot help feeling that the public, or at least tihe Deputies, have rather enjoyed it and are proud of having had such a “ grown-up malady. For some days Feroughi tried to form a Cabinet and then refused to try further, since nothing that he could produce was acceptable to the Majlis. The press has, in the main, supported him and lays the blame on the Deputies for objecting to his Cabinet nominees without stating their reasons or producing other suggestions, i.e., adopting an attitude of purely destructive criticism. They have beejn held up as obstructionists and place seekers. Both these accusations are partly true, but much of their ceaseless speech-making was due to a determination to have their say and to exercise that right of free speech so long denied to them under the late regime. Summoned but seldom by Reza Shah, and then only to accord a submissive affirmative, they must, naturally, take a new-found delight in exercising an organ almost atrophied by disuse. A novel method of Cabinet-making was tried on the 6th March, when^ fourteen Deputies were chosen by lot to advise Feroughi as to the composition of his Cabinet. Feroughi, disappointed with the lack of support and the continued criticism (not of him, but of his nominees), is said to have refused to discuss his Cabinet with Deputies chosen by such means, and finally resigned. Ali Soheily was then sent for by the Shah and was entrusted with the task of forming 'a Government. Ali Soheily, at a private session of the Majlis, received a majority of 100 to 2 on a vote of his selection as Prime Minister. He announced his Cabinet at a public session on the 9th March. They are as follows : — Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Home Minister • Ali Soheily (203) (283). Minister of War : Sarlashgar Amanullah Mirza Jehanbani (100) (132). Minister of Finance : Mahmud Badr (41) (51). Minister of Education : Mustafa Adi (1) (1). Minister of Roads and Communications : Yadullah Azudi (39) (49).

Economic. The present wheat shortage is being aggravated by a deficiency in M.T. Surplus stocks exist in some areas, but cannot be transported to areas in need of supplies. Contracts with the British military authorities at better rates than the Persian Government has paid have also created a shortage of lorries available for the transportation of wheat. It has already been suggested to the Persian Government that a proper use of the considerable A.T. resources of the country would go far towards remedying this evil. Persian A rmy. 3. (See paragraph 4 of last Summary, No. 42/9.) The Chief of the General Staff has said that his intention is to form a division in Isfahan instead of a brigade because (a) the locality is centrally situated, and (b) it is near the largest recruiting area. Internal Security. 4. Khorassan (see paragraph 5 of last Summary, No. 42/9). Soulat-es-Sultaneh is still in hiding at Kalat Nadiri, but his following has nearly all dispersed. The arrival of Persian troops in the Quchan-Bujnurd area has had a steadying effect. 5. Ears. Acts of brigandage on the Shiraz-Bushire road and the Shiraz- Tul-i-Khosrovi road are reported. Operations in Dashti based on Khornuj against Ali Ismail’s followers have begun again. 6. Kurdistan. According to the Chief of the General Staff, the situation in Kurdistan is still serious. Insufficient troops and the uphelpful attitude of the Russians in not allowing Persian troops into Urumieh and Mehrabad (Sauj Bulaq) are hindering operations, since, without a simultaneous advance southwards from Mehrabad through Saqqiz, operations northwards from Senneh must lose much of their efficacy if the Kurds can slip away either northwards into the Russian zone or westwards over the Iraq border. 7.

Political. - THE new Cabinet and its programme received an almost unanimous vote of approval in the Majlis on the 12th March. The Deputies were, it seems, a little ashamed of their previous exhibition of capriciousness and irresponsibility; and a little frightened of the possible results of their demonstration of their own unfitness for democratic government. They are well aware that there are aspirants to another dictatorship. 2. The change of Government cannot be interpreted as an indication of ' public displeasure with the treaty, as the new Prime Minister was, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, intimately connected with the treaty negotiations. He intends to retain the portfolio of the Interior, but to hand over that of Foreign Affairs when the nominee he has in view, who is believed to be one of t)he Persian representatives now abroad, r reaches Tehran. Ali Soheily is a man of some /Aw. - 9 courage and energy, untroubled by too fine scruples. He starts with the advantage ; vis-a-vis his own countrymen of having formed his Government without being /Kf influenced by foreign pressure. 3. The programme of the Government, as published in the press, is as follows :— (i) In foreign policy, while upholding the interests of the country, to implement all the treaties in force and particularly to collaborate closely with those Governments whose interests are linked with those of Persia. (ii) The reform of laws with a view to ensuring a more complete juridical security, and of other laws not consistent with actualities. I (iii) The reform and strengthening of the organisation of the army and security forces. (iv) To make every possible effort to assure food supplies. (v) To overhaul economic and financial affairs, taxation and expenditure. commercial regulations, and to ensure budgetary equilibrium. (vi) To pay particular attention to agriculture, to the improvement of the condition of peasants, to the extension of irrigation; to effecting a gradual reduction in the cultivation and use of opium. (vii) The improvement of national industries and of the living conditions of the working classes. [28—32](viii) Reform of the political division of the country; development of local self-government. (ix) Development of national education and endeavour to improve the moral level of the nation. (x) Development of the organisation of the Ministry of Health. In his speech introducing this programme the Prime Minister particularly stressed his concern with public health, security and the supply of food. These, he said, would receive the first attention of the Government. Press. 4. A number of new papers have appeared expressing sentiments and policies of every kind, even friendliness to Great Britain. The demand for an improvement in security and for a higher sense of public responsibility is general, and the sterling-rial exchange continues to be of considerable interest. The opinion that Persia is acquiring more sterling than can be of immediate value to her is widely held by the public. Appoint merits. 5. —(i) The late Prime Minister, Mr. Feroughi, has been appointed Minister of the Court. He should be a wise counsellor to the Shah. (ii) Mr. Sadjadi (M.A. 248/A; F.O. 183), formerly Minister of Ways and Communications, has been appointed Mayor of Tehran. Economic. 6. The food situation remains serious in many parts of the country. Prices of sugar and of wheat in particular are extremely high in spite of Government control, as, owing to shortage of Government stocks, a black market prevails for those who can afford it. Inefficiency and corruption greatly aggravate the existing shortage, which is at present the main cause of discontent and of anti-British sentiment. Announcements in the press of the considerable quantities of wheat imported by the British authorities have no favourable effect on people who experience only high prices and scarcity. Internal Security. General. 7. Except in Pars, Bakhtiari and parts of Khuzestan. there have been few reports of disorder. In the provinces of Khorassan, Kerman, Mazanderan and in Eastern Azerbaijan the situation has improved. Kermanshah is quiet and Kurdistan has produced no new developments except a minor skirmish between Persian forces from Diwandarreh and Kurds, which is said to have resulted in the dispersal of the latter. • Ears. 8. The road between Shiraz and Bushire is disturbed. There have been minor robberies, some shooting at lorries and a few hold-ups. There is as yet no reason to believe that these incidents have any political significance. But there is general unrest and anxiety lest there should be an increase of disorder when the tribes migrate in the spring. Nasir Qashgai (see Summary No. 4/42, para graph 11) and the Government are still temporising with each other. If he were dealt with firmly now, he would probably submit, but further delay may encourage him to defiance. He has been promised the support of certain disgruntled Kalantars of sub-tribes and there are always sections of the tribe ready to create trouble. But, as far as present information goes of the four main sub-tribes, the Darashuri and Shishbuluki are not anxious to be forced into opposition to the Government. Some of the Kashquli chiefs are said to have promised to support Nasir, but it is doubtful whether the majority of the Kashqulis will wish to get involved. The attitude of the Farsimadan is not yet clear. The Qashgai tribes have not more than 2,000 rifles, probably less, and a very limited amount of ammunition. They are offering huge prices for both. 9. Concentrations of the very troublesome Boir Ahmadi tribe are reported near Ardakan (58 miles north-west of Shiraz). The report mentioned in Summary No. 8/42, paragraph 10. that a military post at Tal Khosrovi (}-inch map sheet3 H.39.J) had been attacked and disarmed has been confirmed. The Boir Ahmadi have also been robbing in South-Eastern Khuzestan. There are reliable reports that they have been in communication with Xasir Khan, although the distance between them is great and they have not usually collaborated with the Qashgai. ^^^ircumstantial report has also been received that certain German agents, a®&gt;mpanied by one of the Boir Ahmadi chiefs who was under detention in Tehran, left Tehran recently with rifles, ammunition and money for the Boir / jr„ i,,,/•&gt; **4 Ahmadi. This report has been confirmed except as regards the German agents) ^ .tion of tho arms and the destination of the arms, &amp;c. Bakhtiari. fa* 10. In Bakhtiari there are unusual movements, sigjis of restlessness and many rumours of impending trouble, but there is not yet sufficient evidence to allow of an appreciation of probabilities. It is not impossible that the rumours are put about and the signs of restlessness created by the khans themselves, some of whom are endeavouring to persuade the Government that the situation in Bakhtiari requires the restoration of the khans to their old position of authority, and all of whom are agitating for the return of their lands. 11. For a report regarding the possibilities of combined action by tribal leaders, see Summary No. 8/42, paragraph 6. British Interests. 12. There has been a noticeable increase in anti-British and pro-Axis propaganda since the fall of Singapore and Rangoon, these defeats having greatly encouraged Axis sympathisers. The propaganda is mainly verbal; wherever i’t originates, it is spread by ordinary bazaar gossip. 13. Sir A. Clark Kerr, British Ambassador-Designate to Russia, left Tehran by air for Kuibyshev on the 13th March. 14. The railway line from Ahwaz to Khorramshahr has now reached Mile 34. Russian Interests. ^ 15. The first convoy of goods for Russia by the Nokkundi-Meshed road ^ !no ^ ’ reached Meshed on the 2nd March. 16. Over 800 American lorries have been delivered to the Russians in Tehran. Italian Interests. 17. The Swiss Legation has taken charge of Italian interests from the Japanese Legation. Chinese Interests. 18. The Chinese Minister to Turkey is expected to reach Tehran shortly to establish diplomatic and commercial relations between Persia and China. Dutch Interests. 19. Baron von Aerssen Beyeren, Dutch Minister in Tehran, has left Persia to take up a similar appointment in Australia. M. Brauw, recently Dutch Consul at cA. A in India, is now charge d'affaires.

THE Minister of Finance has presented his budget for the year 1942-43 to the Majlis. He has estimated revenue at 3.134 million rials and expenditure at 3,132 million rials. He states that he has estimated for the maximum probable revenue and the minimum probable expenditure. Compared to the previous year, receipts are down by 479 million rials and expenditure by 1,191 million rials. 2. A commission has been formed of officials of the Ministries of Agricul ture, Finance and Interior to consider and execute such measures as are necessary to ensure adequate sowing while there is yet time. The Agricultural Bank has been authorised to give an advance of 3 million rials for the purchase of spring wheat. 3. The Majlis has passed a Bill which is designed to pi-event hoarding, cornering and speculating in necessities. The intention is good; the execution unfortunately depends on venal departmental officials. 4. The press has recently published articles stressing the need for careful consumption and maximum production of food-stuffs, for the reason that imports by sea may be made impossible by the Japanese. 5. Some pressure is being brought on the Government by the press and public criticism to persuade them to cease the purchase of sterling until the amounts accumulated have been spent on goods to be imported. Royal Eamily. 6. The Queen returned from Cairo on the 18th March. A ppointments — Civil. 7. The following appointments have been announced :— (i) Mubasir Roshanan to be Farmandar of Ardebil. (ii) Flussein Ali Said Nairi, now Farmandar of Turbat-i-Haidari, to be Farmandar of Quchan. (iii) Shahrukh Nairi to be Farmandar of Bujnurd. (iv) Karim Izadpaneh to be Farmandar of Turbat-i-Haidari. (v) Morteza Quli Khan Bakhtiari (M.A. 60; F.O. 49), son of Samsam-es- Sultaneh, to be Governor of Bakhtiari.2 Persian Forces. 8. The Majlis has approved the Bill authorising the payment to the dependants of officers and men killed in the Anglo-Russian invasion of pensions equivalent to the rates of pay being drawn by the deceased at the time of his death (see Summary No. 5/42, paragraph 3). A ppointments — Military. 9. Sarlashkar Riazi, from Deputy Chief of the General Staff to he Under secretary of State for War (see Summary No. 22/41, paragraph 17). Sartip Seifullah Shihab, from Director of the Ilnd Bureau of the General Staff to be Deputy Chief of the General Staff. Sartip Mohamed Hussein Firuz (M.A. 94; F.O. 75) to be General Officer Commanding the Fars Division, vice Sartip Siahpush. It is understood that he is to become Governor-General in addition. 10. With possibly serious disturbances impending in Fars. Bakhtiari (possibly affecting the oil-fields area and the railway) and Kurdistan, the Persian General Staff are hard put to it to find the necessary troops. They are unable to take advantage of the permission of the Russians to send a brigade to Tabriz and have to content themselves with a skeleton staff and the cadre of an infantry regiment. The troops they have are in many cases unreliable and they are very largely recruits. The sentiments of a number of the officers remain strongly pro- Axis and anti-British. They are consequently not disposed to take effective action in the protection of what they may consider to be British interests. Internal Security. Khorassan (see Summary No. 10/42, paragraph 4). 11. Saulat-es-Sultaneh has informed the Persian authorities that he is willing to surrender if given a guarantee of life. A zerbaijan. 12. With the arrival of Persian troops in Ardebil (see Summary No. 9/42, paragraph 4, last sub-paragraph), Eastern Azerbaijan appears to have settled down. The Russians have now agreed that Persian troops may be sent to Tabriz. Owing to lack of troops, only a token force can be sent. Kurdistan. 13. There are no further developments. Khuzestan. 14. There are disturbances around Gach Saran, of which details have not yet been received. These are probably connected with the unrest among the Bakhtiaris and Boir Ahmadis reported in Summary No. 11/42. paragraphs 9 and 10. Fars. 15. Although no serious incidents have been reported during the week, the situation remains very unsatisfactory. Nasir Qashqai has again refused an invitation, accompanied by a guarantee of his liberty, to come to Shiraz to discuss the question of his lands. He has now' moved from his quarters near Firuzabad to the country north-west of Kazarun, where he can get into touch with the Kashquli, Darashuri and Boir Ahmadi. 16. It is now confirmed (see Summary No. 11/42, paragraph 9) that the Boir Ahmadi chief who broke away from Tehran was Abdullah, son of the late notorious Shukrullah. He was accompanied by Hussein Quli Mamassenni, son of the late Imam Quli, and by Abdul Qasim Bakhtiari, son of Amir Mufakham. All of them were under detention, although not imprisoned, in Tehran, and their escape and their return to their tribes will probably lead to an increase of disturbance. Bakhtiari. 17. The appointment of Morteza Quli Khan as Governor of Bakhtiari (see paragraph 7 (v) above) is in the long view a retrograde step forced on the Persian Government by their weakness, and particularly that of their forces.i 3 The restoration of tribal chiefs to positions of authority in their own tribes cannot in the long run he in the interests of Persia. The immediate effect in I^j^itiari will probably he good and to the advantage of British short-term po ■cy. Morteza Quli Khan has never shown any particular pro-British sentiments, but he is probably the most influential of the Bakhtiari Khans and his interests lie with the preservation of order owing to his considerable wealth, some of which consists of land in the vicinity of Tehran. But his appointment at this moment, when there was disturbance and disorder in Bakhtiari, may encourage other chiefs, such as Nasir Qashqai, to provoke similar conditions in the hope that they may result in a similar solution. Goods to Russia. British Interests. 18. The weight of goods for Russia carried by road U.K.C.C. is as follows :— ti-ansport by the From Andimeshk to Pahlevi and Tabriz— T ons. In January ... ... ... ... ... 8.407 In February ... ... ... ... ... 7,858 lst-18th March ... ... ... ... 2,747 ^ t '* 19. Up to the end of February 756 trucks for Russia had been assembled at Bushire, of which 263 had carried 400 tons of mixed goods for Russia to Tehran. 20. The U.K.C.C. has now 1,200 trucks under contract, of which 400 are out of action owing to lack of tyres and spares. 21. Russians in Tehran have been openly expressing discontent, particu larly to Americans, with the delay in the election of the lorry assembly plant at Andimeshk. The Russians appear to believe that the fault lies with the British. Evacuation of Poles. 22. Owing to shortage of food in Russia, a considerably greater number of Poles is to be evacuated through Persia than was originally intended. If the Russian authorities carry out the programme which they have agreed upon with the Polish authorities in Russia, 40,000 Poles will reach Pahlevi between the 27th March and the 2nd April. Russian Interests. 23. Although the Russians have agreed to a Persian garrison at Tabriz, they maintain their refusal to have Persian troops at Rezaieh (Urumieh). They have, it seems, hinted to the Persian Minister for War that this is because they are uncertain of the Turks, and consequently want no troops along that border but their own.

At long last, the Government had announced a 'Tribal policy' composed mainly of vague promises, and had set up a commission to consider the whole question. The real problem is whether authority should be restored to the Tribal Chiefs or continue to be exercised through Government officials. Economic. In view of the currency shortage, a Bill had been rushed through the Majlis authorising a further issue of notes to the value of 7 hundred million rials (£5 million). The food situation was critical in several districts,and difficulties had been increased by the influx of 45# c °0 PolesfihcunpurehQood* meat and vegetables, etc. in the local markets luu/ to be fyuy\cAa^cJ.

THE new Government has not yet shown any greater capacity for making up its mind than its predecessor. Urgent problems, such as the critical shortage of currency, tribal policy, the disposal of expropriated lands, are still the subject of inconclusive arguments between conflicting, but undecided, views. A declara tion of tribal policy is promised in the near future. 2. Generally, it may be said that almost everyone in Persia—Government officials, tribal chiefs—is playing for time: endeavouring to postpone any definite action until it is known what the spring will bring forth. U L . Economic. 3. The shortage of currency has become critical and, unless an extra issue of notes is made, banks will have to close in the near future. A reserve of notes is available, but the Government pretends to be unable to justify its issue Various measures for forcing the hand of the Government are now under consideration. Internal Security. Khorassan (see paragraph 11 of Summary No. 12/42). 4. Following a convergent movement of Persian troops on Soulat-us- Sultaneh’s refuge at Kalat-i-Nadiri, he has gone to Bajgiran to negotiate the terms of surrender with General Nakhchevan. Azerbaijan (see paragraph 12 of Summary No. 12/42). 5. The Soviet authorities have not yet agreed to the despatch of troops to Rezaieh. Owing to shortage of strength, those sent to Tabriz will consist of an infantry battalion cadre and a skeleton divisional headquarters only. Kurdistan (see paragraph 13 of Summary No. 12/42). 6. General Shahbakhti has returned to Kermanshah and has resumed command of the Kurdistan operations. Persian troops are said to have advanced again to within 12 miles of Saqqiz and a clash between them and the rebels would seem imminent. Khuzistan (see paragraph 14 of Summary No. 12/42). 7. Further unrest in the Gach Saran area is reported and the Persian troops have attacked a Boir Ahmadi tribal encampment in the A.I.O.C. area, killing several people, including women. As a result, the tribal situation is likely to deteriorate in this area. [ 29—9] r— „ I REGd. .^OL. DEPt. I 13MAY 942 [INDIA OFFICE2 Fars. 8. Nasir Qasfiqai is still endeavouring to meet British officials, but has so far refused to come to Shiraz to meet Persian officials. A force has been despatched to Ardakan to deal with a new Boir Ahmadi threat to that place. Dashti. 9. The incompetent Colonel Ahenin has been relieved of the command of the forces operating against Ali Ismail. No rifles have been collected and the withdrawal of the force to Khormuj and subsequent inaction seem to imply that the settling of this affair has made no progress. Road Security in Fars: Bush ire and Shiraz Road. 10. As a result of a recent tour of inspection, certain causes of the present insecurity have been noticed. They are briefly :— (i) Lack of strength : about 1,500 men short in Fars and about eighty short on the section Bushire-Shiraz. (ii) Lack of mobility : no striking force or force for hot pursuit can be organised. (iii) Lack of any means of inter-communication between gendarmerie (Amnieh) posts. (iv) Inertia of Amnieh personnel, due to long periods on detachment with no inspection by their officers to ascertain their welfare or their efficiency. (v) Low morale of Amnieh, who now are concerned chiefly with protecting themselves and their posts rather than traffic on the road. (vi) Lack of any system of effective patrolling or piequeting. (vii) Lack of liaison and co-operation between army and Amnieh, due to their being under separate Ministries, i.e., War and Interior. Persian Officials. 11—(i) Ibrahim Qawam, Qawam-ul-Mulk (M.A. 231) (F.O. 169). returned with his family to Tehran on the 28th March from India. (ii) Muhammed Ali Humayunjah, Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, has been appointed Under-Secretary of State in that Ministry. British Interests. Evacuation of Poles. 12. The evacuation of Poles from Russia has begun, but instead of this being at the rate of 2,500 a week, as had been originally proposed, the Soviet authorities decided at very ^hort notice that 40,000 Poles wouldi be landed at Pahlevi at the rate of 3,000-5,000 a day, beginning on the 26th March. These Poles belong to the 8th. 9th and 10th Polish Divisions and also include the personnel of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, the Army Artillery School, the Army Tank School and the Reinforcement Depot. They are to be followed after an interval by a further 40,000-50,000 Poles, made up of Poles from Russian labour battalions and camps and other sources. Information has also been received that it is the intention of the Soviet authorities to evacuate to Persia about 12,000 Polish civilians, largely women and children. 13. This sudden change of Soviet policy is believed to be due mainly to shortage of food in Russia, but partly to Russian anticipations that there would be delays in the promised equipment and arming of Polish divisions in Russia. 14. Owing to various unavoidable bottle-necks, it will be impossible to evacuate the Poles from Persia as fast as they arrive. Consequently it is necessary to form large holding camps at Pahlevi and Tehran. Arrangements are being made to accommodate 15,000 in Tehran. Railways. 15. Sixty-four miles of the railway from Nok Kundi to Mirjawa had been completed by the 27th February. Tehran, March 31. 1942. xe- vV 3 aJLca.

Enclosure. OAJL, A Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 14 for the Period April 1-7. 1942. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. I HE Government, who laboured long over it. has at last announced a so-called tribal policy. It is a very small mouse. It makes vague promises of improvements in education, medical services, administration, and undertakes to examine complaints and remedy injustices. It makes no reference to special tribal problems and indicates quite clearly that the Government has no tribal policy. In the hope of finding one, it has now appointed a commission, which is to include some alleged experts on tribal affairs. The real problem is whether authority over the tribes is to be restored to tribal chiefs or to be exercised through Government officials. 1 he former solution is a reversal of the policy consistently followed by Reza Shah, who successfully substituted his own tyranny for that practised for many years by tribal chiefs. Tribesmen who have experienced both are probably not unanimous in their preference. The solution they would choose is no authority at all. The Government is very loath to take the first steps towards a return of the conditions of twenty years ago—with some reason, as is shown by the history of Ears from, say. 1910 to 1920. On the other hand, they feel that the situation is getting out of hand; their generals tell them that the troops are unreliable; firmness is a quality not yet developed in a constitutional Government in Persia; and they may take this retrograde step and let future Governments pay the price. Economic (see Summary No. 13/42, paragraph 3). 2. The Government, under strong pressure from His Majesty’s Minister, rushed a Bill through the Majlis authorising a further issue of notes to the value of 700 million rials. There has been public criticism and anxiety lest this means inflation. The Minister of Finance and the press have made reasonable state ments explaining that the issue is fully justified by the increase in value of the cover (gold, silver and Crown jewels) available, and these have had some effect. Profiteers are, however, making the additional note issue a pretext for raising prices. 3. The Government has imposed a ban on the purchase of all foreign exchange by the banks. They propose that British Government requirements In rials should be provided by a credit of 400 million rials, to which account will be credited the value of goods supplied from the sterling area. This matter is under discussion. 4. The food situation remains critical in many of the country districts, notably in parts of Khuzestan and South-East Persia, where very severe conditions prevail. Some towns are living from hand to mouth, but impending [29—10] RECd. POL. DHPr* H 'G*Y 942 INDIA OFFICEcrises have been averted just in time in most cases. It is believed that wheat is still being hoarded, but with the approach of the new harvest, which, it is hoped, will be up to the average, hoarded stores should soon appear on the market. 5. The influx of 45,000 Poles has greatly increased anxiety regarding the food situation. Although these are being supplied by the British military authorities with imported wheat, sugar and tea, other articles of food, such as meat, vegetables and fruit and fuel, are being purchased locally on a limited market. This is undoubtedly causing hardship to the local population and complaints are already loud. 6. The Minister of Finance in an interview with the press stated that since September 1941 imports of wheat from the sterling area has been 40,798 tons at a cost of £630,355, and that other goods had been imported to a value of about £600,000. A ir Services. 7. The Persian Government has announced its intention to inaugurate air mail services between Tehran on the one hand and Kermanshah, Meshed, Tabriz and Bushire on the other. It is doubtful whether this programme will be imple mented in full, but the service to Kermanshah is due to begin at once. A ppointments — Civil. 8. —(i) Sartip Muhammad Hussein Firuz to be Ustandar of Fars (see paragraph 9 of Summary No. 12/42) in addition to commanding the Fars Division.

There has been no increase in disorder except on the part of the Boir Ahmadi, but it may be assumed that Nasir Qashqai has been endeavouring to strengthen his position with a view to defying the Government if they should challenge him. The Government’s policy remains quite indefinite. Boir Ahmadi. 10. This tribe is living up to its old reputation for lawlessness and truculence. A section of them who winter in Khuzestan attempted to blackmail the A.I.O.C. with a demand for a large sum of money, backed by threats of an attack on Gach Saran. As was reported in Summary No. 13/42, paragraph 7, they were attacked by Persian forces, who, after some desultory fighting, appear to have caught up and fired on the main body of the section, which included women, of whom three were killed. There were other casualties among the tribesmen. Apprehensions were expressed lest the tribesmen might attempt to take their revenge by attacking the A.I.O.C. at Gach Saran, so a battalion of British troops has been sent there. There is no evidence yet whether the effect of the action of the Persian forces will be locally salutary or provocative. 11. Other sections of the tribe are reported to have surrounded and to be attacking Ardalan (58 miles north-west of Shiraz), and raiding parties have attacked traffic on the Shiraz-Isfahan road near Yezdikhast. An increase in Boir Ahmadi lawlessness was anticipated in Summary No. 12/42, paragraph 16, when the escaped chiefs joined the tribe. In addition to Abdullah, son of Shukrullah. Hussein Quli Mamasseni and the son of a famous old Boir Ahmadi brigand. Sartip Khan, are reported to be in the vicinity of Ardalan, where they are likely to be joined by Ali and Vali. who have been creating trouble in the south.3 LA r I ^Sakhtiari. 12. The appointment of Morteza Quli Khan to he Governor of Bakhtiari has not yet taken effect. Morteza Quli is being wayward and has again increased his demands. It seems doubtful now whether he will accept the appointment on any reasonable terms. Meanwhile, although there are many reports of what the A^khtiari could do and might do, nothing very much is happening. The general impression is that the majority of the tribesmen want to be left in peace. This does not mean that they cannot be stirred up. A report, for which there is probably some basis of truth, says that a detachment of Persian troops of some thirty men was disarmed at Luzdegan in the Janiki Sardsir, 70 miles south-west of Isfahan. The leader in this affair is said to have been Abdul Qasim Bakhtiari, who was reported in Summary No. 12/42, paragraph 16, to have broken away from detention in Tehran. Kurdistan. 13. The rebel Kurds are reported to have evacuated Saqqiz and to have withdrawn towards Baneh. This is reported in the Persian press as a great success for the Persian army. There may have been some skirmishing with the rebels, but there is no immediate intention of reoccupying Saqqiz with Persian forces. It is reported from Tabriz that an emissary from Hama Rashid had arrived there saying that the latter was ready to discuss terms of peace. Khorassan. 14. Soulat-es-Sultaneh is reported to have surrendered and to be on his way under escort to the capital. Persian Forces. Morale. 15. In the south a spirit of defeatism seems to be spreading among Persian troops. As the tribes grow bolder, the army grows more pusillanimous. Several small detachments have surrendered their arms without excuse. The generals of the Isfahan and Pars Divisions, believing that they hear the rumbles of coming trouble in the Bakhtiari, Boir Ahmadi and Qashqai tribes, have reported that their troops, being locally conscripted, cannot be relied upon to fight against local tribes. This is a pretext, as only a small proportion of the Pars and Isfahan troops are enlisted from the tribes mentioned. The generals in question have been relieved. The fault lies entirely with the officers, many of whom, apart from their natural dislike of any hardship, are influenced by their pro-Axis sentiments and by enemy propaganda against taking any action that might be helpful to the British. There are many indications that the attitude of young officers is very hostile. Appointments — Military. 16—(i) Sartip Abdur Reza Afkhami (M.A. 2) (F.O. 2) to be Military Governor of Tehran. (ii) Sartip Mehdi Quli Tajbaksh (M.A. 209) (P.O. 291) to be General Officer Commanding the South-Western Division (Lurestan and Khuzestan). (iii) Sartip Zahidi Fazlullah (M.A. 303) (F.O. 217) to be General Officer Commanding the Isfahan Division. The Persian Royal Family. 17. According to the Journal de Tehran, the ex-Shah is not in good health in Mauritius. The following from his entourage have left Mauritius for Persia :— H.M. Ismat-ul-Maluk, wife of Reza Shah. H.H. Prince Hamid Reza, sixth son of Reza Shah. H.H. Princess Fatimeh Pahlavi, third daughter of Reza Shah. H.H. Shamsul Maluk, eldest daughter of Reza Shah. Faridun Jam, son-in-law of Reza Shah.4 Polish Interests. Evacuation of Poles from Russia. 18. Up to the 3rd April 34,828 Poles had landed at Pahlevi. These included 27.428 men and 1,075 women for the military forces, and 6,325 civilian refugees. Of these, 7,032 of the former and 3,864 of the latter had reaclyrii Tehran by the 4th April. The Poles of military age who have reached Tehran a*c in very good spirits and, on the whole, in very fair physical condition. They appear to be excellent material. 19. The disinfecting, clothing, feeding, transport and accommodation of these Poles are most difficult problems which are taxing all concerned to the utmost, particularly as regards the civilian refugees. Their arrival was quite unexpected; consequently, all arrangements have had to he improvised at the shortest notice with very little means. They are without any organisation; many of them destitute, under-nourished and sick. In Pahlevi there is inevitably considerable confusion and some hardship. In Tehran some organisation is appearing. The arrangements for the military Poles are working surprisingly well considering that they were only prepared to deal with a fraction of the numbers now arriving. 20. General Anders passed through Tehran on his way from Russia to London. General Zajae from Mid-East is now in Tehran. The announcement made by the Polish authorities in London that General Boruta-Spiechowicz is to command the Polish army in the Middle East has, it seems, been very well received by the Poles, but is believed to be a disappointment to General Zajac.

THE crisis of the week has been the British demand for the expulsion of the Japanese Legation. The Majlis, consulted by the Cabinet in secret session, rejected the demand, it is believed, unanimously. Further pressure met with further delaying tactics, but eventually resulted in the Japanese Legation being informed on the 12th that they were to leave within a week. 2. Action has at last been taken against certain notorious pro-Axis Persians, six in number, who had been named by His Majesty’s Legation. They have been removed to towns in South-Eastern Persia, where it is promised they will be kept under police surveillance. 3. The commission referred to in Summary No. 14/42, paragraph 1, whose purpose it is to investigate grievances in tribal lands, is to consist of the Minister of Justice as president, the Attorney-General, the Under-Secretaries and Directors-General of the Ministries of Finance and of the Interior, and a repre sentative of the Ministry for War (General Muqaddam (M.A. 182)). 4. The Government has announced in the press that instructions have been given to the Governor-General of Kermanshah and to the General Officer Commanding the Forces in the W T est to investigate certain complaints made by the inhabitants of Kurdistan regarding their lands. . 5. Hostility to the Allies is extending and deepening. Their supporters are disheartened and afraid to give practical expression to their sympathies. The causes are many : the occupation is resented; people are hungry and miserable; prices continue generally to rme, due, it is popularly believed, to British purchases and British insistence on an additional note issue; there is great disappointment that article 7 of the treaty, which promises economic help, has as yet brought no additional benefits nor even concrete promises; insecurity is increasing; the news continues to tell of British disasters. These sentiments in the country are partly responsible for the Government’s reluctance to take any definite pro-Ally or anti-Axis action. Appointments — Civil. 6. Mohsin Samiyi to be Farmandar of Gorgan. Ismail Nawab to be Farmandar of Bandar Abbas. Economic. 7. The Minister of Finance in a statement to the press stated that the reasons for the scarcity of wheat in recent years were— (i) The limitations imposed on the cultivation of rice resulting in a greater consumption of wheat. (ii) Development of cotton-growing on land previously producing wheat. (iii) The uneconomic price paid to the cultivator for wheat. [29—19] REC®. POL. DEPt. ?0&gt;VIAYi942 INDIA OFFICE2 .. v 8. The Government has prohibited the export of potatoes and onions. 9. A statement has been published in the press giving a denial to the reports that the British military authorities were exporting wheat from Persia, and stating that, on the contrary, 60,000 tons of wheat had been imported from Canada and India. Persian Forces. yirri 10. There has been some criticism of the Persian army in the Majlis of its inability to maintain order in spite of the large sums of money spent on it in recent years, suggestions for its reduction, and even for its disbandment. The Minister for War, in reply, said that recent events had shown that the army had been unsuitably organised, but that it wasrnow being reconstituted. 11. The Shah has ordered the trial by court-martial of all senior officers who deserted their posts at the time of the British and Russian invasion. 12. Two battalions of infantry from the Tehran divisions are being sent to Pars to relieve two local battalions, in the hope that the former will prove more reliable.

IN the Majlis the budget session let loose, as usual, an extra heavy spate of garrulity on the part of the Deputies. Criticism was directed against almost ^very Department of State, and even the Ministry of the Court came in for some adverse comment. The Minister of War’s reply to criticism of the army is summarised in paragraph 5 below. The army budget is summarised in paragraph 6. /v Economic (see Summary No. 14/42, paragraph 2). 2. The future expansion of the note issue (which will be necessary to finance our undertakings in Persia) will present considerable difficulty and produce much opposition in the Majlis. A possible and suggested action would be for the Persian Government to find the cover for this extra issue from its sterling holdings. They are unlikely to adopt this obvious plan, but will almost certainly presses a quid pro quo^ for an alteration in the rate of exchange? a substantia] measure of economic help and any other desiderata.

The following is a summary of the reply given in the Majlis by the Minister of War to criticism on the army vote : The Persian army was the creation of twenty years of effort. At the cost of many casualties in officers and men it has given the country security. After fulfilling its task of achieving security, it was preparing itself for the task of national defence when the war broke out. Like many other modern armies, it was insufficiently mechanised, and like manv other armies, it had broken down in consequence. Certain officers had shown a lamentable neglect of duty in deserting their posts when danger came and they were being sought out and punished. Steps were being taken to improve 1 the type of young officer student. A new organisation had been laid down (see military attache’s Summary No. 9/42, paragraph 4). Conscription was necessary as the basis of a national army. The country, besides, could not afford a volunteer army. The A rmy Budget. 6. The budget, which to date has passed its first reading, makes a provision of 700 million rials “ for the Ministry of War and balance on account of army purchases.” As usual, expenses of the navy and air force are included in this vote. A provision for the Amnieh (gendarmerie) is made of 150 million rials. Though this force is under the Ministry of the Interior, it is, in effect, a defence services item. A further sum of 1 million rials is provided for the expenses of the Conscription Department. Thus the total sum for defence or quasi-defence departments amounts to 950 million rials (equals £6,500,000 at the present l ate of exchange), or approximately 33^ per cent, of the country s total budget provision of 3,132,873.081 rials. Internal Security. Dashti (see Summary No y 13/ 42, paragraph 9). 7 Thou°'h Colonel Ahinin has been recalled, and though reinforcements amounting to &amp; 200 rifles reached this force on the 22nd March, the force is still inactive in Khorttmj. The situation shows signs of deterioration. Bakhtiari (see Summary No. 14/42 , paragraph 12). 8 The appointment of Murteza Quli Khan as Governor of Bakhtiari has not taken effect. All the Bakhtiari Khans residing in Tehran have been placed under police surveillance, and a reliable report from Isfahan states that the Khans residing there have been treated in a similar manner. Some apprehension is felt that these precautions, coupled with the despatch of two columns from Isfahan and Shahreza converging on Semi run (some \ Yezdikhwast), may signify some offensive action against the Bakhtiau with the strong possibility of infiaming sections of the tribe at present quiescent, and wit the probable result that the weak and untrained Government forces may sutler a reverse and precipitate a general Bakhtiari rising The new General Officer Commanding in Isfahan. Zahidi, is reported to be a fire-eater. The Chief of the General Staff has definite ideas about tribes and has expressed the view that nothing but a good drubbing will bring them to heel. He appears to resent the opinion that, sound as his views may be, the Persian army is hardly in a state to undertake any offensive action. The Minister of War showed a better under standing of the situation and assured the military attache that Zahidi had been told to do nothing precipitate and that the two columns were not sent on any offensive mission, but that their presence in Semirun would have a steadying effect.3 A zerbaijan. 9. The general situation has improved. Owing to the cessation of Soviet support, Kurdish stock has fallen. The streets are no longer full of swash buckling Kurds who defy arrest. The numerous democratic clubs are on their last legs. Many of the upper-class Tabrizis who fled the town in fear of local ^unrest have returned from Tehran through fear of typhus and rising prices. 10. Amir Asad, the Governor of Mahabad (Sauj Bulagh) (see Summary No. 14/42. paragraph 8 (v)), is likely to experience difficulty in maintaining order, placating rival aspirants and, in particular, combating the influence of the Ghazi Muhammad. ^Kurdistan (see Summary No. 15/42, paragraph 15). ^ 11. General Shahbakhti has recommended to the Persian Government that negotiations should be opened with the Kurds. The Governor-General of Kermanshah began a tour of the area on the 11th April to examine the grievances which the Kurdish chiefs might put forward. The^ Persian Government s proclamation (see paragraphs 3 and 4 of Summary No. 15/42) has had very little effect in Kurdistan, even though leaflets announcing it were dropped over the area on the 10th April. The Kurds like other tribes, have little faith in Persian Government promises and would prefer a British guarantee of eventual fulfil ment. This they cannot, of course, have unless the policy of His Majesty’s Government were to be completely changed. Even so, General Shahbakhti s suggestion and his Government’s acceptance of it and the Kurds willingness to treat are hopeful signs. Owing to Kurdish disunity, it is extremely unlikely that all unrest will cease, but a temporary lull will benefit the Persian Government. Fars. 12. There has been a general deterioration in the security situation. On the Shiraz-Bushire section Amnieh posts have been attacked, road gangs have been shot at and travellers robbed. Around Shiraz itself robbers have been active on the outskirts of the town. On the Shiraz-Isfahan section the Boir Ahmadi have again been looting travellers on the stretch Abadeh—T azdikhwast— Aminabad. , n -r- n 13. Sartip Firuz, the new Military Governor-General of rars, has started to negotiate with Nasir Khan Qashqai. This in no way implies that hiiuz approves of setting up Nasir Khan as the chieftain of the whole of the Qashqais or that he is in sympathy with all of Nasir Khan’s demands, or that he approves of negotiating with a man who defies the Government. It is the weakness of his forces, their low morale, their lack of mobility and his lack of experienced officers which has led Firuz to play for time and to try and wean some of the mam tribes away from Nasir Khan; in short, to achieve by politics what he cannot achieve by force. Foreign Interests. Russian. 14 __.( a ) Major-General Melnik has taken over command of the Soviet forces in North-West Persia from Colonel Selivanoff. (b) On the 15th April a fracas occurred between some Persians and a Russian lorry-driver whose vehicle had collided with a child, as a result of which some Soviet officers who intervened received minor injuries. The incident, though trivial had repercussions, and the Minister of War stated to the British Militaiy Attache that, on the insistence of the Soviet Embassy, he had been obliged to tender an official apology on behalf of the Persian Government. The British Military Attache took this opportunity of speaking to the Minister of War m very plain language of a number of cases of insults to British soldiers on the part of Persian soldiers and officers in Tehran. (A The number of Soviet troops in Azerbaijan is said to have increased •considerably in recent weeks and to have reached a total of 100,000-105 000. According to one observer, the Russians are apprehensive of Turkey s attitude m the event of a German invasion, and the refusal of the Russian authorities to allow Persian troops into Western Azerbaijan is due not to their desire to see disorder continue (as previously thought), but to their wish to keep such dubious .allies as the Persian army well away from the possible scene of combat.Polish. 15. On the 16th April the distribution of the Poles evacuated in the first echelon was as follows :— Military Poles— Pahlevi. Teh ran. Left Tehran. Destinations other than Tehran. Males 7,752 8,600 5.124 7,566 Women 131 880 17 Boys ... 1,185 ... Civilian Poles— Males ... 1.568 Women 5.310 Children 3,267 These figures were supplied by the Poles and are not to be taken as exact. Japanese. 16. According to the Chief of Police, there has been much closer social contact between the Turkish Embassy and the Japanese Legation since the Persian New Year. The Turkish Military Attache, in particular, has been paying frequent visits to his Japanese colleague. The Japanese, according to the same informant, have sold all the furniture in their legation and all their motor cars except one to their landlord for a sum of 900.000 rials (about one-quarter of their present-day value). The only motor car they have retained is the large car previously owned by the Grand Mufti, in which they propose to travel when they leave the country. Their departure has been postponed to the 4 23rd April. Norwegian. 17. M.

REPORTS of a concentration of British troops at Sultanabad and of the move of Russian troops from Zinjan towards Kazvin, which, though exaggerated, were founded on fact, notably improved the atmosphere in Tehran, and induced an almost pro-Ally sentiment in some Persian officials. 2. The following proclamation under the signature of Police Headquarters has been made in the Tehran press :— “ According to the Tripartite Treaty Persia being allied to the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain, it is notified that all pro-Axis or anti-Ally propaganda or attempts to conceal Axis subjects is contrary to the interests of the country and to the terms of the alliance. The police will deal severely with delinquents according to the law.” A ppointments — Civil. 3. Ahmad Mashaikhi to be Farmandar (Governor) of Kashan. The Court (see Summary No. 14/42, paragraph 17). 4. The Queen Ismat-ul-Muluk and her children, Hamid Reza and Fatime, who had accompanied Reza Shah to Mauritius, have returned to Persia via Zahidan. Communications. 5. The construction of the railway line from Ahwaz to Khorramshahr has now been completed. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 6 . There have been clashes between Persian troops and rebel Kurds in the area south of Saqqiz. According to the reports made to the Persian War Office by the General Officer Commanding in Kurdistan, the fighting originated in attacks by the Kurds on his forces and resulted in the defeat and withdrawal of the Kurds. He reports that his forces have pursued to within 10 miles of Baneh, [29—50] RECo. POL. DEPt. i JUN1942 INDIA O FFICE / S —v&gt; where they are now holding an important pass. If these reports are true, this success of the Persian forces should produce in the rebel Kurds a more reasonable attitude towards terms of settlement. Both the Persian Government and General Shahbakhti, the military commander, if his report to the Minister for War can be accepted as a true expression of his sentiments, are prepared to go some way in satisfying Kurdish demands. Fars. 7. Although there is still general insecurity, which has a harmful effect on road maintenance owing to the number of petty robberies perpetrated on Labourers, in its main features the situation has not further deteriorated. The new Governor-General, who is also general officer commanding, appears to be plucking up some courage, but whether it will be sufficient to embolden him to take a firm stand with Nasir Qashgai is doubtful. The acknowledgement of this chief as head of the Qashgai tribes would give him considerable power in Fars, and, if the military situation in Persia were unfavourable to the Allies, it is unlikely that that power would be used in our interests. The Boir Ahmadi are still quite out of control. Columns of Persian troops are said to be converging on their summer headquarters from Shiraz and Isfahan, and it is reported that two important sections of the tribe have already fallen out and are fighting each other—a not unusual condition. Bakhtiari. 8 . It is refreshing to find that the new General Officer Commanding the Isfahan Division professes a much less serious view of the Bakhtiari situation than did his predecessor and more confidence that he can control it with the forces at his disposal. He claims to have defeated the rebel band of Abul Qasim Bakhtiari (see Summary No. 14/42, paragraph 12), but this defeat was clearly not decisive, as Abul Qasim and his band are still in being. Foreign Interests. Russian. 9. Reliable reports from various places occupied by Russian troops all speak of their admirable behaviour and discipline. Drunkenness or brawling is almost unknown; their treatment of the local population js considerate, and enquiry in towns where tihere are Russian troops produced no complaints from the lower classes. Their appearance makes a very favourable impression. They are not smart, but they and their horses are generally fit, hard and workmanlike 10. A further batch of 850 American trucks for Russia is to be assembled at Bushire and to be driven via Tehran to Tabriz by Russian and Persian drivers engaged by the U.K.C.C. For this purpose the Russians are sending 200 military drivers, who will be armed, to Bushire. 11 . The Russians have offered to assist the Persian Government in their anti-locust campaign by providing aircraft to spray the infected areas in Khuzestan. Seven of these aircraft left Tehran for Ahwaz on the 28th April. The Persian Government are to pay fairly heavily for this assistance. Japanese. 12.

Further trouble at Rezaieh following an attempt by the ^ gendarmerie to disarm some Kurds entering the town,which led to a considerable risenjand panic in some of the neighbouring villages, caused the . ersian Government to protest to M. Molotov, who replied accepting, in principle,the right of the Persian Government to send troops to Rezaieh, and stating that the Russian forces had been instructed to co-operate in the restoration of order. In Kurdistan the Persian forces had re-occupied Saqqiz and the rebel leader Hama Rashid was reported to be on the Iraq frontier. Negotiations had been opened‘iy'lhe Kurds and the Persian G.O.C.

THE following is the text of a decree issued by the Government:— Goods, Exports of which are Prohibited. The Council of Ministers has approved, in accordance with the proposal of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Mines, that expoit goods should be divided into three classes :— Firstly : goods, the export of which is absolutely prohibited in order to assure the country’s needs. . „ , Secondly: goods, the export of which requires a permit trom tfte Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the exporter undertaking to import specified goods in exchange. . , Thirdly : goods which can be exported by making a foreign exchange undertaking in accordance with the regulations in force as before. The goods whose export from the country is absolutely forbidden are as follows :— 1 Gold and silver in ingots or as coins, articles made of gold and silver, all animals and edible meat, cereals such as wheat, barley, rice, millet, maize and grains such as peas, lentils, split beans and vetch, beans, potatoes and potato starch, dairy products, honey, eggs, elastic woven garments, cottpiq sterilised cotton, surgical gauzes, sewing thread, woollen cloth and stockings, woollen thread, blankets, clothes and other things made of wool and cotton, leather, shoes, 'leather bags and suit-cases, oxen and buffalo hides, matches, gunny bags and wrappers, jute thread and cord, raw flax or jute home-produced cardboard, foreign goods whether in their original form or changed in any way, and any goods manufactured from foreign goods (with the exception of old glass and crockery of no practical use), hats made m Persia, soft sugar and loaf sugar, treacle sweetmeats and other stuff containing sugar, tinned fruit, metals and articles made of metal. [29—55] *04 RECd. POL. DEPt, HJUN 942 INDIA OFFICE L-l Vi £&gt; cf2 Motor Transport. 2. The following statistics of motor transport in Persia have been compiled from U.K.C.C. sources : — (A) Total number of civilian motor vehicles now under licence, including all Government transport, army contractors’ vehicles, but excluding^ vehicles owned by the army : — (i) Load-carrying vehicles : 2,000 light, 2,000 medium and heavy. (ii) Passenger buses : 600. (iii) Passenger cars : 2,800. (iv) Motor cycles : 500. (v) Technical and all unclassified vehicles and tractors : 50. (B) Categories as above, off the road awaiting spares and tyres :— (i) 750 light, 750 medium and heavy. (ii) 100 . (iii) 700. (iv) Unknown. (v) Unknown. Irrigation Projects. 3 . The following note on irrigation projects was given recently by the Minister of Finance at a weekly press conference :— (a) The Shabankareh barrage on the Shahpur River (Pars). Started in 1938. Will irrigate 10,000 hectares this spring; it can be extended to irrigate 30,000 hectares. (b) A dam is to be constructed near Bushire to provide that town with a suitable water supply. (c) The Behbehan Irrigation Company began work in 1938 to utilise the waters of the Marun River. The scheme will begin to provide water this autumn. (d) The Rawansar dam on the Qara Su River near Kermanshah started to provide water for irrigation last autumn. (e) New channels have been dug to make better use of the springs near Semnan. Pro-Amis Agents. 4. A further list of twenty-four persons believed to have pro-Axis sentiments has been handed to the police. Of these, four are to be deported, the rest to be warned and watched. A German, Gottlieb Ruppel, who was in hiding, has been arrested. Perso-Russian Relations. 5. In connexion with the Kurdish outbreak at Rezaieh (see paragraph 10 below), the Persian Government has sent strong notes of protest to the Soviet Ambassador and directly to M. Molotov against the continued Soviet refusal to allow Persian troops at Rezaieh. Appointments — Civil. 6 . —(i) Dr. Hussain Marzuban to be Ustandar (Governor-General) of the 4th Ustan (Rezaieh). (ii) Hussain Naficy,. a Directcfr-General in the Finance Department, to be Director-General of the Persian State Railways. (iii) Yahiapur, formerly Farmandar of Saveh, to be Farmandar of Garrus. (iv) Adil Rukni to be Farmandar of Saveh. (v) Mustafa Quli Kemal Hedayet (Fahim-ud-Dowleh) (F.O. 104) (M.A. 141) to be Ustandar of Isfahan Province (Department No. 10). (vi) Muhammad Ali Muaddil to be consul at the Persian Consulate-General in Delhi. Persian Forces. 7. There has recently been considerable criticism of the army in the press and Parliament, directed against its oppressive conduct in the past, its heavy cost to the people, the arrogance of its officers and its present inefficiency in the preservation of internal security. This caused some concern to the Shah, who associates himself very closely with the army, and to the officers, who had long enjoyed immunity from public criticism. The eftect has probably been salutary.3 8 . The Minister for War has laid before the Maj-lis a project of a law for the reformation of the Conscription Law. Details are not yet available, but its purpose is believed to be to lighten the burden of conscription and to prevent some of the existing abuses in its application. '^^pointments—M ilitary. 9. Brigadier Abdullah Hidayet to be Deputy Chiejf of the General Staff. Brigadier Seifullah Shihab to be Director of Military Schools. Internal Security. A zei'baijan. 10 . There has been further trouble at Rezaieh, originating in an attempt by the Persian gendarmerie to disarm some Kurds entering the town. This occasioned a rising of considerable numbers of Kurds, who surrounded the town, pillaged adjacent villages and attacked and disarmed a gendarmerie post of twenty-eight men. Whether they entered the town or not is not yet known. Owing to Russian objections, there are no Persian troops in that area and the gendarmerie is restricted to small numbers inadequate to deal with serious disorder. The Russian garrison refused to intervene, but it is reported that the Soviet authorities were instrumental in persuading the Kurds to withdraw from the vicinity of the town. Considerable panic reigned for a time, but the situation is now calmer. At a conference between the Soviet Consul-General, the Persian Chief of Police and the Kurdish leaders the latter formulated the following- demands, which were forwarded to Tehran :—■ (1) No gendarmerie posts to exist in Kurdish region between Khoi and Mahabad. (2) Kurds to be allowed to carry arms. (3) 1,200 rifles alleged to have been given to Persian villagers in the Rezaieh district to be withdrawn. (4) Kurds to have one representative in each of the Government Departments in Rezaieh. (5) Kurds to enjoy freedom in their own national affairs. ( 6 ) Persian Government to provide schools in Kurdistan, where the Kurdish language would be used. (7) Certain specified lands to be restored to their original Kurdish owners. ( 8 ) Twenty Kurds now in prison to be released. The rifles mentioned in the third demand—though probably less than 1,200— were issued by the Persian Government to villagers for their own defence against Kurdish depredations. Kurdistan. 11 . The action of the Persian forces against the Kurdish rebels reported in paragraph 6 of Summary No. 17/42 appears to have been effective. The Persian forces are reported to be in strong occupation of a pass on the Saqqiz- Baneh road some 7 miles from Baneh. The greater part of the rebel band has dispersed, and Hama Rashid, the rebel leader, is said to have taken refuge in Iraq. Some Persian officers, whom he had taken prisoner, have been released and state that they were well treated. Saqqiz has been reoccupied and telegraphic communication with Tehran has been re-established. 12. The officer commanding the operations has reported that the villages have suffered greatly from the depredations of Hama Rashid’s followers. He also reports that he hopes to make a peaceable settlement with the Kurds of Avroman I ow Ita-y and Merivan. 13. It is feared that the unpunished outbreak of the Kurds at Rezaieh (see paragraph 10 above) may have disturbing repercussions on the Baneh area. Fars. 14. There have been fewer cases of brigandage on the roads, but the situation as regards Nasir Qashgai remains much where it was. There is no fresh information about the Boir Ahmadi and as yet no indication that the local authorities are ready to take effective action against them. Meanwhile, they are fighting each other.4 1 Bakhtiari. 15. Abdul Qasim (see paragraph 8 of Summary No. 17/42) has not yet submitted, but His Majesty’s Consulate, Isfahan, reports that he is disheartened, that his followers are leaving him and his funds running out. The truth probably is that the senior Bakhtiari Khans in Tehran, who have probably been investi gating these disturbances, have become doubtful of the success of their bluff. Kerman. 16. His Majesty’s Consul reports a deterioration in security. This was to be expected, as economic conditions in parts of the province are appalling; many people are dying of hunger. Foreign Interests. Russian. 17. Russian officers in Persia do not conceal their suspicions of Turkish good faith. They profess to see in the arrest .and trial of two Soviet citizens in Angora, accused of an attempt to murder von Papen, evidence of Turkish subservience to Germany. These suspicions probably account for the increase of Russian troops along the Turkish frontier reported in paragraph 14 (c) of Summary No. 16/42. The numbers there reported were, however, an exaggeration. 18. * It seems clear that the Russians have now withdrawn encouragement and support from the various clubs and committees of subversive character that had been flourishing in Azerbaijan. They are now inactive and languishing from lack of funds. But towards the Kurds Russian policy seems to have some ulterior motive. Recent events at Rezaieh and their continued refusal to allow Persian troops to be stationed there or the gendarmerie to be made up to adequate strength seem to indicate that they have no intention of allowing the Kurds to be disarmed. They may perhaps hope that they might be useful to them against Turkey. 19. The port of Bandar Shah (C) has now been dredged sufficiently to allow of ships coming alongside the jetty. A ship has actually discharged direct to the jetty. 20. The Soviet Government have delivered 1,000 tons of wheat to the Persian Government at the port of Naushahr. At the same time they are preventing the export of food-stuffs from the occupied provinces to other parts of Persia. 21. The Russians secretly moved by night 300 troops from Kazvin to the Qaleh Morgeh aerodrome in the vicinity of Tehran, which they had already occupied with air force and transport personnel some time ago. The purpose of this move is not clear, but it may have been to anticipate a possible occupation of Tehran by British troops. A merican. 22. It has been announced that Lease-Lend facilities are to be extended to Persia and Iraq. 23. An American journalist, Mrs. Burdett, travelling in Azerbaijan, was killed near Miandoab by Kurds. The Soviet authorities believe that the attack was instigated by Axis agents, but it is more probable that she was accidentally killed in a quarrel between Kurds who were accompanying her and a party met on the road. 24. An American Consulate has been opened at Tabriz. The consul, Mr. Kuniholm, has stated that he is there expressly to observe Russian policy in Persia. Polish. 25. The distribution of the Poles in Persia up to the 4th May was as follows :—■&gt; Military— Pahlevi. Tehfan. On Hahhaniya A hwaz. Route.

For the first time for many years all foreign military attaches were recently invited to attend a Persian military function, the occasion being a display of jumping at the Military School.

Internal Security. ^ Azerbaijan. 9. There is little further reliable news from Rezaieh (see Summary No. 18/42, paragraph 10). The Kurds have withdrawn from the vicinity of the town, where the situation is now reported to be calm. 1 he Minister for Wai, who has some prestige in that area, accompanied by the new Governor-General, Dr. Hussein Marzuban, has visited the town. The former, in a proclamation to the inhabitants, said that he had been deputed by the Government to enquire into the situation and make the best possible settlement. He promised that the following steps would immediately be taken :—- (i) Urgent representations would be made to the Soviet authorities with a view to the re-establishment of security. (ii) Armed troops would be sent to suppress the bandits. (iii) Government would indemnify those who had been looted. . (iv) Complete re-establishment of security. When military posts had been established the people would be informed and they would then return to their villages. Many telegrams and other reports have been received by Government from inhabitants of the Rezaieh district giving harrowing tales of pillage and atrocities by the Kurds. These are probably exaggerated, but it seems Hue that for a time there was panic in the villages. Discussions are now in progress between the Ministry for War and the Soviet military authorities in Azerbaijan regarding the strength of Persian forces to be sent to the Rezaieh area. Kurdistan. 10. Details are not yet available regarding recent developments in Kurdistan. There have been no further hostilities, and the bulk of the Persian troops have been withdrawn from the neighbourhood of Baneh to Saqqiz. Hama Rashid is reported to be close to the frontier, sometimes in Iraq, sometimes in Persia. His followers appear to be inactive. There hate been negotiations between the General Officer Commanding Persian forces and certain Kurdish chiefs of the area, of which details are not yet available, but it is reliably reported that the latter have accepted certain responsibilities for order and administra tion. The general officer commanding has made further reports of the destitution and misery prevailing in the villages in the area which have been ravaged by Hama Rashid and his followers. Bakhtiari (see Summary No. 18/42, paragraph 15). 11. Abdul Qasim Bakhtiari, son of Amir Mufakham (M.A. 63), has sub mitted to General Zahidi and has undertaken to reside in Isfahan. Presumably his band has dispersed. There are no further reports of trouble in Bakhtiari. Fars. 12. The situation is calmer. There have been fewer robberies. Pourparlers still continue between Nasir Qashgai and the Governor-General (Sartip Firuz). It is understood that the latter’s proposal to make Nasir Governor of the Qashgai has not met with the approval ox the Persian Government. There is no further news from the Boir Ahmadi. Khuzistan. 13. There has been some robbery and pillage by bands of Arabs, and the local Persian commander (Sartip Tajbaksh) proposes to make some demonstration with troops to restore order. He does not expect any serious opposition.3 British Interests. 14. H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester arrived in Tehran by air on the 10th May. He was met at the aerodrome by His Majesty’s Minister, the Soviet Ambassador, the Chief of the Persian General Staff and other Persian officials, ^j^ere were Persian, British and Russian guards of honour.

The Soviet authorities had allowed 1,500 Persian troops (details of which will be found in paragraph 7) to be sent to this district.

An ^Juilysis of the Russian attitude towards the Kurds will be found in paragraph 23. No further developments had been reported from Kurdistan where Hama Rashid was still at large. Hold-ups and assaults on labour on tne Shiraz-Isfahan road were probably thef work of migrating tribes who also caused damaged to crops. A settlement had not been reached between the Governor-General and Nasir &lt;$ashgai. The Boir Ahmadi were still troublesome but had suffered a reverse in an attack on Bandar Dilanv Poles.

There has been some loss due to locusts and rust and to the failure of the spring rains in some parts. Communications. 3. The Persian air service between Tehran and Kermanshah has been running regularly once a week since the 6 th April. 4. The Minister of Communications has announced that the railway from Tehran to Shahrud and from Tehran to Zinjan will shortly be opened for’ public traffic.

Ardelan, counsellor to the Persian Legation at Vichy, accompanied by his staff, arrived in Tehran on the 11 th May. No news has yet been received of the date of departure from Bucharest of Mohsin Rais, Persian Minister at Vichy. Persian Forces. 7. The force to be sent to Rezaieh (see paragraph 12 below) is to consist of— 2 weak battalions of infantry, 2 squadrons of cavalry, 1 battery of 6 guns, 1 detachment of 4 mortal's, 1 detachment of 6 light tanks. The total strength is 1.500. [30—29] I RECd. POL. DEFt. I 16JUN 942 INDIA CFFICF. 1The commander is Colonel Mahin, an artillery officer, speaking French and Russian, sensible and tactful. 8 .

It is understood that the American Government has agreed to supply these officers. ‘ A pfointments — Military. 9. Sarhang Ahmed Sartipe to he Inspector of Infantry on the staff of General Shahhakhti. Legal. 10. In the past the serving of summons, writs and notices on military personnel has been a slow and sometimes impossible task. In order to speed up the procedure, new legislation has been introduced whereby such summons, &amp;c., will be served direct on military personnel residing outside barracks and military zones, and on those residing in barracks or military zones through military tribunals, who are enjoined to see that no delay occurs. ^ i Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 11 . The situation in the Rezaieh district is calmer, hut villagers are still afraid to return to their homes. On the 17th May the Governor-General reported that in Rezaieh there were 60,000 refugees from the villages who were refusing to go back until some security was guaranteed to them. There are more refugees in Shahpur and Khoi. The Soviet authorities are said to be co-operating with the Persian authorities, but not to the extent of taking action by force against the Kurds. They had promised the Minister for War to post detachments of troops among the villages with the object of inducing the inhabitants to return, but this measure has not yet sufficiently restored confidence. 12. The Soviet authorities, after holding out for some time for a maximum of 500, have now agreed that 1,500 Persian troops may be stationed at Rezaieh. The first detachment is to be sent from Tehran on the 18th and 19th May. 13. The outbreak at Rezaieh is reported to be confined to the Herki and the Shakak, some of the latter having come over from Iraq. The Herki are renowned for their savagery and lawlessness, and, although the atrocities attributed to them were greatly exaggerated, preliminary reports indicate that they caused considerable loss of life and destruction. The Minister of War says that, according to reports given to him at Rezaieh, there were about 350 killed and wounded among villagers and gendarmerie. This number may prove to have been exaggerated. The Governor-General of Rezaieh has reported that some 300 villages have been pillaged in the district. 14. A peculiar feature of the outbreak is that, according to reports from several sources, Assyrian and Armenian villages did not suffer. This is regarded by Persians as an indication that the Kurds were anxious not to antagonise the Russians, on whose neutrality they felt they could rely. The Turkish Military Attache finds it even more ominous. He sees in it proof that the Russians are favouring the Kurds and Assyrians with a view to instigating them against the Turks should necessity arise. 15. The General Staff reports that the forces sent to Eastern Azerbaijan (see Summary No. 12/42, paragraph 12) are now disarming the Luchianlu section of the Shahsevan tribe in the neighbourhood of Ahar (D.S. No. J. 38 L.). Kurdistan. 16. No further developments have been reported. Hama Rashid is still at large, sometimes on one side of the frontier, sometimes on the other. Until he has been put under restraint, the peace of Persian Kurdistan will always be liable to be disturbed. Fars. 17. There has been no serious interference recently with traffic on the road between Bushire and Shiraz, but between Shiraz and Isfahan there have been hold-ups and assaults on labour. These are probably the work of migrating Arab7 &lt;2 ty} / S ^ v tribes. There is insecurity in the countryside and some destruction of crops by the tribes who are now in migration. There is, however, a general feeling of anxiety. The Governor-General’s overtures to Nasir Qashgai have as yet led to no settlement. It is understood that the Government disapproves of the extent to which he wishes to go to placate Nasir, on the ground that the latter would then ^A^too powerful. 18. The Boir Ahmadi are still on the warpath, robbing indiscriminately villagers, other tribes and each other. The Qashquli sub-tribe of the Qashgai and the Bakhtiari have been obliged to alter their lines of migration to keep out of the way of the Boir Ahmadi. A party of the latter attacked Bandar Dilam and apparently suffered a reverse. The leader, Kabutar Farsi, is reported to have been wounded and captured. This is the man who attempted to blackmail the A.I.O.C. at Gach Saran (see Summary No. 14/42, paragraph 10 ), and the attack on Bandar Dilam was probably retaliation for the punishment he had suffered from the Persian forces near Gach Saran. Bakhtiari. 19. The migration appears to be progressing with no more than the usual disturbance. There are no reports of lawlessness. A British official who recently travelled through Bakhtiari country, meeting some headmen of sub-sections, reports that he found, on the whole, friendly sentiments towards the British and only the general complaints of all Persians against bad administration. British Interests. 20. The visit of H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester had a very good effect. It was appreciated as a compliment to Persia and did something to soothe injured feelings. Although his movements were not advertised beforehand, fairly large crowds greeted him cordially wherever he went. Belgian Interests. 21. All Belgian technicians and specialists in Persia, who could be useful in the development of the resources of the Belgian Congo, are being mobilised for service and sent there. Russian Interests. 22. Colonel Selivanoff, Chief of Staff to General Melnikoff. Commander of the Russian Forces in North-West Persia, has been promoted to general’s rank. 23. As far as can be deduced from recent events in Western Azerbaijan, Russian policy towards the Kurds within their zone of occupation is to avoid antagonising them and to give no help or encouragement to the Persian authorities in disarming them. There is no reasonable ground for the accusation made by the Turkish Military Attache that they have armed the Kurds, but, on the other hand, they do not appear to have made any attempts to prevent them from acquiring arms from the Persian forces when they disintegrated before the Russian advance in August last. The purpose of this benevolence can only be to gain the friendship of the Kurds with a view to making use of their nuisance value. There is some excuse for the Turkish suspicions that in following this policy it is Turkey that the Russians have in mind. There is insufficient evidence to show how far they have encouraged Kurdish aspirations, but there is no doubt that the Kurds, or some sections of them, have interpreted the Russian attitude as encouragement. Reliable information, however, shows that the Soviet authorities have been shocked by the damage done in this recent outbreak to peaceful villagers, who, failing to get protection from Russian troops, have naturally assumed that the Kurds were acting with Russian approval. To antagonise the peasant is no part of Russian policy. Iraqi Interests. 24. Abdul Rahman Falahi, first secretary of the Iraqi Legation in Angora, has been appointed Iraqi Consul at Kermanshah.4 x Polish Interests. 25. A total of 351 Poles left Tehran on the 15th May on the Habbaniya route, making the distribution up to the 18th May as follows :— Military— Pahlevi. Tehran. A hwaz. On Habbaniya Route.

AN increasingly gloomy view is being taken by the Persian authorities of the prospects of the coming harvest. Such reports as are available indicate that, although crops in some areas are likely to be considerably below earlier hopes, there is as yet no cause for serious anxiety provided hoarding can be prevented and transport is available to ensure distribution. 2. The Minister of Finance, in arguing that the increase in the note issue was little to blame for the rise of prices, stated that the present note circulation was 2,190 million compared with a previous 2,000 million. 3. The following foreign trade statistics have been published for the month the 21st March-20th April :— Rials. Commercial and duty-free imports Exports (other than A.I.O.C. and fisheries) Value of real foreign trade Excess of exports over commercial imports Total revenue collected by Customs 92,473,390 69.486.790 126,161,045 12,689,171 82.486.790 C ommunications. 4. Railway passenger service to Zinjan was inaugurated on the 21st May and to Shahrud on the 23rd May. Officials. 5. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Fathullah Pakravan (M.A. 208) (F.O. 154/1940), formerly Governor-General of Khorassan and ew officio controller of the Meshed shrine, for alleged embezzlement.

(iii) Muhammad Said Maraghehi (M.A. 252) (F.O. 182), Persian Ambassador to the U.S.S.R., has left Moscow to return to Persia to take up the appointment of Minister for Foreign Affairs. (iv) Amanullah Ardelan has been appointed Director-General of the Ministry of Finance. Khorassan. Internal Security. 7. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports a recrudescence of banditry by trans-frontier outlaws which has affected the security of the Meshed- Zahidan road between Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari. [30—40]♦ A zerbaijan. 8 . The situation at Rezaieh has greatly improved, due to the co-operation ol the Russian authorities, who, in addition to posting detachments to give confidence to the villagers, have been persuading the Kurds to return some of the loot Pillaging has ceased and the countryside has returned to normal. The first echelon of the Persian troops destined foioRezaieh has reached Tabriz, where it will await the arrival of the second echelon. 9. Recent and relatively reliable information shows that the number of killed and wounded was considerably less than the figures reported in Summary No. 20/42. paragraph 13. The Soviet authorities estimate that the casualties on both sides were about forty killed and seventy wounded, and that the material damage done was considerably less than the 70 million rials reported by the local Persian authorities. Kurdistan. 10 . The situation is quiet. Hama Rashid and his followers—reliably reported not to exceed 200—are in the mountains near the frontier. A detach ment of Persian troops is in Baneh. The Persian authorities appear to be behaving s with moderation, and to be avoiding provocation, but while Hama Rashid remains at large there will be anxiety that he will raise trouble again when the moment seems favourable. Khuzestan. 11. It is unlikely that any operations will be undertaken against the Arabs (see Summary No. 19/42, paragraph 13), as the Government is of opinion that the situation does not call for military intervention. Fars. 12 . There is little to report except minor robberies and pillaging incidental to the tribal migration. There was a fight between a small detachment of Persian cavalry and a superior force of Boir Ahmadi raiders, in which the former are reported to have acquitted themselves well. Bakhtiari. 13. Ihere is little fresh news after the surrender of Abul Qasim reported in Summary No. 20/42. General Zahidi is said to be using Abul Qasim to procure the surrender of other recalcitrant Bakhtiari leaders, such as Nadir Quli and Alidad. Foreign Interests. Swiss. 14.

THE German success in the Kerch Peninsula has reawakened public fears that the war may reach Persia. They are little, if at all, allayed by Timoshenko’s offensive. Numerous rumours are current, calculated to increase public nervous ness. Pro-German propaganda is active, but has not yet reached that pitch of intensity which may be expected to coincide with the German offensive. The battle in Libya is arousing some interest. The press remains favourable to the Allies. Economic. 2 . There has been a slight fall in some prices, notably wheat and sugar, the former due to the approach of the harvest and the release of hoarded grain. Anti-Hoarding Regulations. 3. Regulations on this subject have been issued under the authority of the Anti-Hoarding Law of the 18th March, 1942, referred to in Summary No. 12/42, paragraph 3 . These regulations provide, inter alia, for provincial commissions comprising governors, provincial directors of finance, public prosecutors, bank managers, municipal chiefs and local notables. The commissions have the right to fix prices, specify certain goods as scarce and liable to declaration, and to carry out searches for suspected hoards. The selling of wheat except to Government is forbidden. In order to prevent profiteering in medicines, chemists are forbidden to sell except on a doctor’s prescription. Doctors must keep records of all prescriptions given and chemists of all drugs dispensed. In order to regulate the consumption of essential food-stuffs, &amp;c., the following quantities have been laid down as normal consumption :— Flour per person, per day Rice per person, per year Cooking butter and butter, per year Grains and potatoes, per year Charcoal, per year Soap, per year [30—54] Kilog.

In future, export certificates are to be abolished and a stamp duty of 6 per cent, ad valorem is to be charged on all import licences. A stamp duty of 1 per cent, ad valorem is to be charged on all customs licences for exported goods. ^ Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 5. There is still anxiety among the populace of the Rezaieh region, but confidence is being restored. The Soviet authorities have expressed to His Majesty’s Legation apprehensions of incursions of Herki Kurds from Iraq. The first echelon of Persian troops has reached Rezaieh. It is unlikely that they will take any provocative action against the Kurds, still less make any attempt at wholesale disarmament. Kurdistan. 6 . The Political Adviser to the General Officer Commanding, 10 th Army, recently visited Saqqiz and the headquarters of the Persian troops who operated against Hama Rashid. He heard from local Kurdish villagers many complaints of the depredations of Hama Rashid and his men, and himself saw examples of senseless destruction at Saqqiz. He found little or no sympathy for Hama Rashid nor any inclination by local Kurds to regard him as a national hero. The situation is now quiet. Some responsibility has been given to local Kurds for the maintenance of order, but Hama Rashid, who is in the mountains near the Iraqi border, remains a potential source of trouble. Bakhtiari. 7. The Bakhtiari tribes are now giving no cause for anxiety. They are themselves suffering from the depredations of the Kuhgalu, principally Boir Ahmadi, tribes and have had to abandon their normal line of migration. A reliable British observer who recently travelled through the tribal country reports that he found many evidences of friendly feelings towards the British, very little interest in the war, no evidence that German propaganda or intrigues had had any effect, and generally a desire to be left in peace. He found no desire on the part of heads of sections for the return to positions of authority in the tribe of the big chiefs, who have for long been exiled in Tehran or Isfahan. They had complaints against the extortion practised by Persian officials, but, on the whole, did not seem to think that they were very much worse than their old Khans had been. Fars. 8 . The situation in general has shown no change. There has been no increase in highway robberies. Some of the Khamseh tribes have been looting villages on their upward migration in the Dehbid and Sivand areas. Dashti. 9. The Persian forces at Khormuj have been reinforced by some 300 men and two tanks. Sargurd (Major) Arab Shaibani has taken over command of the force from Colonel Ahenin. The Persian troops have advanced as far as Kaki and Abdan (65 miles south-east of Bushire) without opposition. Another detachment has been despatched by sea to effect a landing on the Dashti coast. Ali Ismail, the Dashti leader, is reported to have taken to the hills. Persian Forces. A appointments — Military. 10 .

A Financial Agreement between the British and Persian Governments was signed on the 26th May :— (i) The agreement fixes the sterling/rial rate for the duration of the war at 128/130, and corresponding rate for United States dollars based on the official sterling/dollar rate of exchange. (ii) The Persian Government undertakes— (a) To purchase for rials at the controlled rates of exchange all sterling area currencies offered to finance the British Govern ment’s expenditure in Persia; (h) To place no unreasonable restriction on transactions in sterling area currencies; (c) To allow all authorised transactions to take place at the controlled rates of exchange; and (d) To make arrangements for maintaining a supply of local currency adequate to finance all commercial and financial transactions between Persia and the sterling area. (iii) The British Government undertakes— (a) To do everything possible to ensure a flow of essential supplies to Persia. (b) If Persia has insufficient dollar balances to pay for “ essential supplies ” from North America, to convert into gold so much of Persia’s sterling balances as are needed to make up the insufficiency of her dollars. (c) To convert into gold 40 per cent, of Persia’s final unspent sterling balances as at the 30th June, 1942, and 40 per cent, of the half- yearly accretions thereafter. (d) To guarantee Persia’s sterling balances against any depreciation of sterling in terms of gold. (iv) The agreement extends treatment to Persia that has not been extended to other countries in the Middle East; in particular, the provisions relating to gold conversion and guarantee of sterling balance may, if they become generally known, cause some embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government in their financial relations with these other countries. Accordingly, as little publicity as possible will be given to the contents of the agreement, although the fact that it must go before a public. session of the Majlis for formal confirmation makes it impossible to treat the agreement as confidential. (v) With effect from the 14th May, the Persian Government authorised the resumption of dealings by the authorised banks in foreign exchange at the rates of exchange fixed by the agreement. So far as sterling area, currencies are concerned, the Exchange Commission is granting buying and selling permits freely. (vi) The special arrangement for the supply of local currency for the Army, &amp;c., that was introduced by His Majesty’s Legation when the Persian Government placed a ban on the purchase of foreign exchange has now been terminated, as normal dealings in foreign exchange have been resumed.4 12. Sir Reader Bullard left Tehran on the 27th May for London for consul tation with His Majesty’s Government. 13. The General Officer Commanding, 10th Army, visited Tehran from the 25th to 27th May. 14. A Central Supply Committee has been set up in Tehran as a branch q! the Middle East Supply Council. Russian Interests. 15. It is reported on good authority that, as a result of recent events in Rezaieh, Russian influence has diminished in Western Azerbaijan among both Kurds and non-Kurds. 16. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that the Russian garrison there has been increased by 1,200 infantry from Askhabad. Polish Interests. 17. General Anders arrived in Tehran from Cairo and London on the 25th May and left by air for Polish headquarters at Yangi Youl (near Tashkent) on the 28th. He said that he had no doubt that he would succeed in getting Soviet agreement to the evacuation of thousands more Poles. Indeed, he hoped to get all Poles, including the divisions he commands, out of Russia. 18. General Boruta-Spiechowicz has left Tehran for England, where he is to join the Polish forces. He has, it seems, lost the confidence of General Anders. 19. There is no change in the Polish evacuation figures given m para graph 15 of last week’s Summary. Tehran, June 2, 1942.

The Governor-General of Ears paints a very gloomy picture of con ditions in the province. He says that, in the southern half of the province, crops are almost a complete failure, that famine already exists outside the towns, that on an optimistic estimate of all the harvest available, wheat, barley and maize, the province will require 30,000 tons of wheat before next harvest. He states that, unless grain and fodder can be imported, many animals will die. This is a serious matter as, owing to the shortage of motor transport, every form of animal transport will become increasingly important. Officials — Civil. 4. Mr. Saed, Persian Ambassador in Moscow, has left Kuibyshev to take up the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Persian Government. Officials — Military. 5.

Tribal questions generally are under discussion and particu larly the attitude the Government should adopt towards the return of tribal chiefs to their estates in tribal areas. Some of these, taking advantage of the breakdown in administration that followed on the events of last August, ha^JT already taken possession of their lands. The generals are on the whole fiot \ enthusiastic about undertaking the operations necessary to dispossess them by force. The Government are also averse from extensive military operations, but at the same time fear the result of allowing the chiefs again to establish them selves in authority in the tribes. Azerbaijan. 7. The situation in the Rezaieh district is calming down. The Soviet authorities are co-operating to restrain the Kurds. Most of the villagers have returned to their homes. 8 . In Khalkbal (Eastern Azerbaijan) there has been some disturbance resulting from the collection of arms by Persian troops (see Summary No. 20/42, paragraph 15). 9. The whole of the force despatched from Tehran (see Summary No. 20/42, paragraph 7) has now reached Rezaieh.- 10. The following important Kurds of Azerbaijan are now in Tehran : Qazi Mohamed and Sheikh Abdullah of the Mahabad (Sauj Bulagh) District, and Qarani Agha, Chief of the Mamish. Among representations they have made is that the Dehbukri chieftain. Amir Assad, whom the Persian Government recently appointed Governor of Mahabad, should be replaced by a Persian official. 11 . The intrusion of a small British mechanised column, moving from Mosul via Rowanduz to Saqqiz, Senneh and Kermanshah, has given rise to a number of rumours in Azerbaijan : the British were coming to keep order in the Rezaieh area, the Russians having failed to do so; the Germans were approaching the Caucasus and the British had come to help the Russians; the British had realised • that the Russians were bound to be defeated and were reconnoitring positions to be occupied when that happened. £ Fars. 12 . The General Officer Commanding the Fars Division reports that the operations in Dashti have been brought to a successful conclusion, all chiefs having submitted except Ali Ismail of Daiyyr. 13. Except for some minor robberies on the road between Shiraz and Abadeh, the work of migrating tribes, the situation in Ears is quiet. Troops are being moved from both the Fars and Isfahan Divisions towards the summer quarters of the Boir Ahmadi and these movements may explain approaches recently made by certain rebel Boir Ahmadi chiefs to Persian officials both in Ahwaz and Isfahan. 14. The Government have informed the Governor-General of Fars that they will in no circumstances agree to the recognition of Nasir Qashgai as head of the tribe. Khuzestan. 15. The General Officer Commanding South-Western Division now considers that it will be unnecessary to make a military demonstration against the Arabs. He has advocated a reasonable policy of reconciliation (see Summary No. 21/42, paragraph 11 ). Kurdistan. 16. The situation in Northern Kurdistan is reported in paragraph 7 above. In Southern Kurdistan the situation is still quiet. General Shahbakhti has, according to his own statement, made an agreement with some of the Baneh Beqzadehs, not including Hama Rashid, regarding local security and responsi bility which may be temporarily satisfactory. There are now no Persian- troops nearer to Baneh than Saqqiz, where Persian administration has been re-established.3 the Shahabad area there are signs of impending trouble, where the Waladbegi and Babajani tribes are reported to be meditating an attack on the (junan. There is, however, as yet no reason to think that this will develop into serious. Russian Affairs. 18. I he Soviet military authorities at Kazvin are now refusing to allow British officers and military personnel to go to Resht and Pahlevi. The matter is being taken up with the Soviet Embassy, who have previously stated on several occasions that there was no restriction on movements to Resht and certain other places. 19. This dhange of attitude may be due to one or more of several causes. For some time past the Soviet military authorities have been asking for the withdrawal of Polish evacuation staffs at Pahlevi and Kazvin on the grounds that there is to be no further evacuation of Poles. It is probable also that they resent the intrusion of British troops into their zone mentioned in paragraph 11 above, and that their suspicions have been further aroused by the inquisitive journeyings of British general officers in the vicinitv of Mianeh, Kazvin and Resht. Egyptian A ffairs. 20 . Abdul Latif Talat Pasha has been appointed Egyptian Minister in Persia. Polish Affairs. 21.
