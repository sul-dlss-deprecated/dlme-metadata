[In continuation of “ Miscellaneous, No. 13 (1914) ” : Cd. 7628.] g- r London, November 20, 1914. I HAVE the honour to report on the circumstances which preceded and accompanied my departure from Constantinople on the 1st November. On my return to my post on the 16th August, a fortnight after the outbreak of the European war, the situation was already such as to give ground for the apprehension that Turkey would be driven by Germany sooner or later to take part in it as her ally. The Ottoman army, under the supreme command of Enver Pasha, who was entirely in German hands, had been mobilised, and although the Government had declared their intention of preserving their neutrality, they had taken no proper steps to ensure its maintenance. They had, on the contrary, jeopardised their ability to do so by the admission of the German warships “ Goeben and Breslau into the Dardanelles on the 10th August. Events have confirmed what I aud my French and Eussian colleagues constantly impressed upon the Grand Vizier and other Ministers at the time, that so long as the German admiral and crews remained on board the German warships, the German Government were masters of the situation, and were in a position to force the hand of the Turkish Government if at any given moment it suited them to do so. •, So far as the Grand Vizier was concerned, the warning fell upon deaf ears, and it was at no time possible to persuade his Highness to admit that he would not be able to control developments to which he was himself opposed and which had not the approval of the whole Government. It is quite possible that he was sincere in this conviction, but he was fully alive to the precarious nature of his own position and to the fact that any real attempt on his part to run counter to the policy of Enver Pasha and the military authorities would have meant his elimination. This event would have brought matters to a head at once, which would have been contrary to the policy of the allied Powers of postponing for as long as possible, if they were unable to avert altogether the intervention of Turkey in the war, with the vast and complicated issues involved in the raising of the Eastern question, so that my role and that of my French and Eussian colleagues, with whom I acted in complete accord throughout, was necessarily restricted to one of remonstrance and to an endeavour to expose and defeat the German ^n pursuance of a long-prepared policy, the greatest pressure was at once exercised by Germany to force Turkey into hostilities. German success in the European war was said to be assured. The perpetual menace to Turkey from Eussia might, it was sue'srested, be averted by a timely alliance with Gertnany and Austria. Egypt mio-ht be recovered for the Empire. India and other Moslem countries represented as groaning under Christian rule might be kindled into a flame of infinite possibilities for the Caliphate of Constantinople. Turkey would emerge from the war the one great Power of the East, even as Germany would be the one great Power of the West. Such was the substance of German misrepresentations. It is a matter of_ common consent that Enver Pasha, dominated fly a quasi-Napoleonic ideal, by political Pan- Islamism and by a conviction of the superiority of the German arms, was from the first a strong 5 partisan of the German alliance. How far his several colleagues and other directino- spirits outside the Ministry entered into his views is to some extent a matter of speculation; but it may he taken as certain that the Sultan, the Heir Apparent the Grand Vizier, Djavid Bey, a majority of the Ministry, and a considerable section o± the Committee of Union and Progress were opposed to so desperate an adventure as war with the allies. At what moment Talaat Bey^ the most powerful civilian m t e Cabinet and the most conspicuous of the Committee leaders, finally threw m ms o with the war party cannot be ascertained precisely. His sympathies were undoubtedly with them from the beginning, but the part which he actually played m the earlier stages is shrouded in mystery. I have reason to think that for some time he may have thought it possible, by steering a middle course, to postpone a decision until it was ° [1146] B 22 clearer what would be the result of the European war; and he may well have been anxious to gain time and to secure in exchange for Turkey’s adhesion to the German cause something more solid than promises. These were tendered, indeed, on a lavish scale, but I am not aware that they were given in a form which could be considered binding. It is certain in any case that Talaat Bey’s hesitations were overcome, and that he had definitely joined the conspiracy to bring about war this autumn some three weeks before the crisis was precipitated. Whatever the views of individual Ministers or others may have been, the Turkish Government made no effort to emancipate themselves from German influence or to stem the tide of its progress. The material hold established by the introduction of the two German ships was on the contrary allowed to be strengthened. Not only did these ships remain under effective German control, but a strong German element was imported into the remainder of the fleet, even before the British naval mission, which had been reduced to impotence by order of the Minister of Marine, had been recalled by His Majesty’s Government. Large numbers of Germans were imported from Germany as unostentatiously as possible, to be employed in the forts of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus and at other crucial points. Numerous German merchant vessels, of which the most important were the “ Corcovado ” and the “ General,” served as bases of communication and as auxiliaries to what had become, in effect, a German Black Sea Eleet. Secret communications with the German General Staff were established at the outbreak of the war by means of the wireless apparatus of the “ Oorcovado,” which was anchored opposite the German Embassy at Therapia, and which was continuously used for this among other purposes throughout the whole period under review, in spite of my urgent representations and those of my French and Russian colleagues. Other German ships played with the Turkish flag as they pleased, in order to facilitate their voyages or cloak their real character while in port, and a department was constituted at the German Embassy for the purpose of requisitioning supplies for the use of the German Government and their ships. All these things were tolerated by a complaisant lurkish Government, who appeared to be indifferent to the incessant encroachments on their sovereignty if not to welcome them. . ( ^ )n * an d’ t ^ ie oncers of the German military mission displayed a ubiquitous activity, iheir supremacy at the Ministry of ^War, combined with the close co-operation which existed between them and the Militarist party, made it easy to fortify an already strong position Acting in conjunction with other less accredited agents of their own nationality, they were the mam organisers of those military preparations in Syria which so directly menaced Egypt, and which became a serious source of preoccupation and a constant theme of my remonstrances. y'denoe of these preparations became daily more convincing-. Emissaries Pasha were present on the frontier, bribing- and organising the Bedouins. BafV 6 frnrt 6 ' e,SJ ’ atCl '; 1 , so “ th &gt; ari 'l battalions of regular troops were posted at stort Cice The T an eorps were held fn readiness to movekAh at short notice. The Syrian towns were full of German officers, who were provided with arge sums of money for suborning the local chiefs. As an illustration of the thoroughness of tne German preparations, I was credibly informed that orders were given to obtain estimates for the making of Indian military costumes at Alenno in order to simulate the appearance of British Indian troops. Under directions from the Central Government the civil authorities of the Syrian coast tokis removed aTtheffi archives and ready money to the interior, and Moslem families were iTrned to it “ to avoid the consequences of bombardment by the British fleet The KlA' ^ re was a party to the conspiracy, and arrangements were actutfly mlde S thWeT control over the armed forces of the State after the aTrivafoTThTt-GoXn“ the d prt tht’ AUTs rk^uerZ' the'pamnhf t encou . ra S e ™ ent by meatt of the powerful members were in sympathy with thLothB^h mtvTmenT IhV* 8 T? actual proof of the inspiration by Talaat Bev and i r&gt; i er !v ^ ln deed, against Great Britain.

The provincial papers were no less enthusiastically pro-German; the semi-official telegraphic agency, which is practically worked by the Ministry of the Interior, was placed at the disposal of German propaganda. Through these agencies unlimited use was made of Turkey’s one concrete and substantial grievance against Great Britain as distinguished from other European Powers, that is, the detention of the &lt;£ Sultan Osman ” and the “ Beshadie ” at the beginning of the European war. Other grievances, older and less substantial, were raked out ol the past; and the indictment of Great Britain and her allies was completed by a series of inventions and distortions of the truth designed to represent them as the enemy, not merely of Turkey, but of the whole of Islam. Attacks of the latter kind became especially frequent in the latter half of October, and were undoubtedly directly inspired by Germany. Mv urgent representations to the Grand Vizier and to Talaat Bey, both verbal and written, had hardly even a temporary effect in checking this campaign. It may seem strange that, thus equipped and thus abetted, those who sought to involve Turkey in the European war failed so long to achieve their object. Ihe reasons were manifold. As I have already indicated, the party which stood for neutrality contained men who, lacking though they were in any material means of enforcing their views, could not easily be ignored. By whatever various routes they may have been arrived at, the ideas of these men coincided with a body of less sophisticated arid hardly articulate opinion which, however wounded by England’s action in preventing delivery of the “ Sultan Osman ” and the “ Reshadie,” could still not reconcile itself to a war with England and France. In my despatch of the 22nd September I had the honour to report how frankly and how emphatically the Sultan himself voiced this feeling in conversation with me. There can be little doubt that the Grand Vizier exercised what influence he had in favour of neutrality. Djavid Bey, the Minister of Finance, whose influence in favour of neutrality was of weight as representing the Jewish element, and whose arguments in favour of peace were supported by the fact that Turkey was already absolutely bankrupt, and not in a position to embark upon war with the allies, became towards the end so formidable an obstacle to the fulfilment of the German plan that instructions were sent from Berlin to force his resignation. Again, seriously convinced as most prominent Turks appear to have been of the ultimate success of Germany, their confidence could not but be a little dashed by the actual course of events in the two main theatres of war; and the more thoughtful realised that even in the event of Germany being victorious, the fact of lurkey having fought by her side would not necessarily ensure any advantage to the Ottoman Empire. As for the Germans themselves, it was true, as I have said, that they could at any moment force Turkey to march with them, but to do so before every means of suasion had proved useless would obviously not have been politic. It was clearly only in the last resort that the Monarch whom Pan-Islamic pro-Germans acclaimed as the hope of Islam, and whom the devout in some places had been taught to regard as hardly distinguishable from a true believer, would run the risk of scandalising the Moslem world, whom he hoped to set ablaze to the undoing of England, Russia, and I ranee, by using the guns of the “ Goeben ” to force the hands of the Sultan-Caliph. But the factor which more than any other delayed the realisation of the German plans, and which enabled me and my French and Russian colleagues to protract the crisis until they could only be realised in such a way as to open the eyes of the Moslem world to the real nature of the conspiracy, was the inherent tendency of Turkish statesmen to procrastinate, in the hope that by playing off one side against the other they might gain more in the long run. _ # . However slender the chances in our favour, it was obviously my duty, m conjunction with my French and Russian colleagues, to support and encourage by all possible means those forces which were obscurely striving for the preservation of peace. If this policy necessarily involved the acceptance of acts on the part of the Ottoman Government which, in ordinary circumstances, would have called for more than remonstrance and the reservation of our rights, and which it would have been easy to make the occasion of a rupture of relations, the patience displayed by the allies was justified by the results achieved. Although unsuccessful in averting war, two objects of main importance were gained by delaying its commencement. On the one hand, the allied Powers are now^ in a position to deal with the problem with a freer hand, and, on the other, Germany has been forced to show her cards and to act independently of a majority of the Turkish Cabinet. [1146] B 34 Under the stress of events in the main theatre of the war ’^^“fj^alned^to the Near East, Germany was constrain necessity of providing a diversion in the Near Eas , ^ fogt three weeks 0 f intensify still further their pressure on the Turks g • i , cast i n t 0 the October their pressure took yet another form, and a new w of secrecy, of scale bv the importation into Constantinople, with cllCJ , n _ i n j- e( ^ u ' n j er large quantities of bullion consigned to the German Amba 7 do 7^ ti ^XVsonie military guard at the Deutsche* Bank.

In the circles in which this decision became known i was re^ar^e as a partial triumph for the Peace party, and as a fresh attempt to gain ime oi e sake either of mere procrastination or of securing more conciete oners rom eimany. Be that as it may, Halil Bey never left on his mission, and it is believed that its abandonment was due to a more than usually blunt hint from the German repre sentative in Constantinople. Whilst Constantinople generally was comforting itse with the reflection that nothing could well happen until after the four days Ban am festival, beginning on the 30th October, two events of capital importance occuried. ^ On the morning of the 29th I received intelligence from Egypt of the incursion into the Sinai peninsula of an armed body of 2,000 Bedouins, who had occupied the wells of Magdaba, and whose objective was an attack upon the Suez Canal. On learning this news I at once proceeded to the Yali of the Grand Vizier, to acquaint him Ox the serious consequences which must ensue if the expedition were not at once recalled. His Highness received the intelligence with every appearance of surprise. He emphati cally disclaimed all knowledge of it, and gave me the most solemn assurance that if the facts were as stated he would at once issue orders for the withdrawal of the^ invading party. He assured me once more that nothing was further from the intention of the Government than war with Great Britain. It was unthinkable, he said, that an expedition of this kind could have been organised by any member of the Government; and he felt certain that if anything of the kind bad occurred, it could only have been a raid by irresponsible Bedouins. I told his Highness that I feared that he deceived him self. I reminded him of the various occasions on which he had given me similar assurances, and of the negative results of the instructions which he had given on previous occasions. I warned him of the disastrous consequences to the Ottoman Empire of a crisis which could not now be long postponed unless he and the friends of peace were prepared to take some serious stand against the conspiracy of which I was fully cognisant, to involve it irretrievably in the general war. On this, as on every occasion of my inverviews with the Grand Vizier, I was impressed with his inability to realise the facts or to disabuse himself of the conviction, in spite of his many unfortunate experiences, that he would be able, in a really serious crisis, to exert his authority with effect. The second event of capital importance was the attack on Odessa and other Bussian ports in the Black Sea on the morning of the same day, the 29th October. It is now certain, that the actual orders for these attacks were given by the German admiral on the evening of the 27th October, but it was not until after they had actually taken place, that is, on the afternoon of the 29th October, when news of the raid cm Odessa was telegraphed to me direct by Mr. Consul-General Boberts, that my Bussian and French colleagues and myself realised that the die had actually been cast and the crisis that we had so long feared and striven to avert had occurred. Imme diately on receiving the news M. Bompard and I called on M. de Giers and decided to ask for authority from our respective Governments to confront the Porte with the alternative of rupture or dismissal of the German naval and military missions. On the— ■ ^ 5 morning of the 30th, however, I learnt from my Russian colleague that he had received instructions from his Government immediately to as i • S n ar ] heo-g-ed written to the Grand Vizier to ask for an interview, which his Highness had begged him to postpone until the following day owing to indisposition The instructions oi my ^ Russian colleague being in a categorical form, he had therefore been ^trained to address a note to the Grand Vizier demanding his passports; and I and my French colleague acting on the instructions with which the Ambassadors of the a Powers had at my suggestion already been furnished to ^'^“sTOrts simultaneously, should any one of them be compelled to ask f oi bis passports, owing either to a Turkish declaration of war or to some intolerable act of hostil ty, decided without further delay to write to the Grand Vizier an as i for interviews to enable us to carry out these instructions In vmw ol his Highness’s indisposition we had not expected to be receive . I’ , , , . hours later the Grand Vizier sent us word that he would nevertheless be gUd to see us, and notwithstanding the excuse which he had made earlier day he received the Russian Ambassador also in the course of noon. My interview with the Grand Vizier partly coincided with that o M de Giers, and preceded that of M. Bompard. It was of a .painful description His Highness convinced me of his sincerity m disclaiming all knowledge of or participation in the events which had led to the ™pture and entreated- me to believe that the situation was even now not irretrievable I replied that the W had passed for assurances. The crisis ' *jia^ occurred, and ^“ere immediately g-n by German missions; which could alone prevent the recurrence of attempts Egypt an territory and attacks on Russia, war with the allies was inevitable.

My own departure was eventuaily arran| ^ families, when I left for Dedeagatch, accompame 7 Government and some other British ^ collea§ue and his staffleftbythesame ^Owing to the wanton refusal of P^ed a t my disposal, thestation was dis ^ arded ’ and after6 protracted discussion, we agreed to leave matters in the hands of the Um e a es Ambassador, who undertook to use all his influence to procure the ^clepaituie o our fellow subjects on the following day. The “ sous-chef de protocole or me u nne Porte and the “chef de cabinet particulier” of the Ministry of f oreign Aflans were sen to bid farewell to M. Bompard and myself at the railway station, and two Secretaries of the Political Department of the Ministry accompanied us to the frontier. It would be impossible to exaggerate the assistance which I have received from Mr. Morgenthau, the United States Ambassador. During the last two days especially the difficulties arising out of the abnormality of the situation would have been immeasurably greater had it not been for his invaluable help and his untiring efforts on behalf of myself and my staff. We are heavily indebted not only to Mr. Morgenthau himself, but to every member of the United States Embassy. It is entirely owing to their exertions that the British and French subjects who were detained at the station on the night of my departure were allowed to leave on the following evening. Before concluding this despatch I desire also to place on record my sense of the cheerful courage displayed by the British community in Constantinople, as well as in other towns, during the whole of this trying period. A large proportion of them have suffered severely in their business from the instability of the situation in Turkey. Many have suffered heavily and more directly by the military requisitions which from the beginning of August were carried out in an inconceivably arbitrary manner. By the suppression of the Capitulations all saw themselves deprived at a moment’s notice of the secular privileges which had hitherto secured the persons and the property of foreigners against caprice and injustice. But they have one and all faced these adversities with a reasonable and manly fortitude. Shortly after my return to my post, I recommended those British subjects who applied to me for advice to send home, when opportunity offered, those members of their families who had no particular reason to stay in the country; A certain number left during the autumn, and many have left since. Those who have chosen to stay, or who have not been in a position to leave, remain under the protection of the United States Ambassador. As regards the British community at Bagdad, I instructed the acting British consul-general at Bagdad, early in October, to charter a steamer for the conveyance to the coast of any British subjects who might wish to leave. A large number of British and British-Indian subjects availed themselves of this opportunity. I cannot conclude this report without calling your attention to the zeal shown by the junior members of my staff, including Mr. Ovey, Lord Gerald Wellesley, Mr. Charles Lister, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Wilson, Mr.Astell, and by Mr. Fuller, Archivist to His Majesty’s Embassy, in the performance of their duties in the Chancery, as well as to the able and conscientious work of the members of the Dragomanate and consulate-general. The Chancery was greatly assisted by the voluntary help kindly offered to them by Judge Cator, the ftev. Canon Whitehouse, Chaplain to His Majesty’s Embassy, and by Dr. Clemow, Physician to His Majesty’s Embassy, as well as by Mr. Weakley, Commercial Attache. _ I need not do more than refer to the work of Lieutenant-Colonel Cunliffe Owen, Military Attache to His Majesty s Embassy, whose information respecting the military preparations was often obtained with considerable difficulty. • ^ S J 10U 1 ( I ^6 to place on record my high appreciation of the conduct of His Majesty s consular officers throughout the Ottoman Empire during the whole period of the crisis. They one and all performed their often difiicult duties with zeal and discretion. I was especially indebted to Mr. Cumberbatch, His Maiesty’s consul- genera! at Beirut, Mr. Heathcote Smith, acting British consul-general at Smyrna and to Mr. Palmer, vice-consul at the Dardanelles, for the valuable information which they sunn hen. a 4 .- ^ ^^ould wish to bring to your particular notice the services rendered by Mr Byan Actmg First Dragoman of His Majesty’s Embassy.

GREY.Dear Colonel Yate, I am just leaving England, after a week snatch ed on my way to the Persian Gulf from Ararat via Archangel» I had hoped to call on you hut had no time for anything. I think however you may he interested to Imow that the Turco Persian frontier was finally demarcated on October 28th, the day before war broke out, the last pillar being erected at the foot of Ararat on the 26th. The whole work took ten months, for the greater part of which I was / Commissioner, Mr. Wratislaw, who was originally appointed being obliged to go home on account of ill health. It was very interesting work and attractive country, but the outbreak of the war made things very difficult towards the end, and whatever pleasure remained was spoilt for me by the treacherous wounding of my Secretary Hubbard Consular Service by some Hurds who mistook h of the Levant in for w Ttos^ ian and acted accordingly. The sciatic nerve in the right nerv- thigh was cut, an extremely painful wound and two fingers damaged. I had. to get him to the nearest railway 200 miles or more away on improvised stretchers over mountain roads, a terrible ordeal for him, poor chap. I am, novo on my way back to the Persian Gulf to rejoin Sir Percy Cox who is with our forces at Basrah. I knovo the country thoroughly between that place and Baghdad and hope to be of use there as guide and political officer etc. What we shall do in Mesopotamia in the future is a most an interesting question, and there is no aspect of our future action _ 4 DEC 1314 there that I should like to put before you, in case itit has nob already occurred to you. All that I have seen and all I have heard dis cussing things with distinguished Indian pilgrims going Karbala and Baghdad makes me think that in the annexation oj Mesopotamia may he found the solution of most difficult questions that must arise in India after war. I should like to see it announced that was to he annexed to India as a colony for India and the Government of India would administer it, ana gradually bring under cultivation its vast unpopulated desert plains, peopling them with martial races from the Punjab, who would he in a position to defend themselves without the aid of a larger regular garrison than, the Turks ^.ave previously wept in M'-sovotamia i.e.about 8000 the outside, m return t^T,t cities of Karbela and Kajaf might be hadded over to Indian Mahomedans to guard, and a distinguished Indian (a Shiah) made Governor so as to keep the wholly Mahomedan. The same might he done for the scarcely less famous Sunni Shrine of Shaikh Abdul Qadir, which is visited yearly by some thousands of Sunnis from India. There are already thousands of Indians living permane in Baghdad and arbela and Najaf, not to mention Samarra. Mohamedan India would feel that it was getting in this manner a quid pro quo for its action in this war, and would be an inspiring thought to -them to be able reflect that India, which had a greater population than any Mohamedan coun try in the world, will have its 'place in the sun' m the future by being entrusted with the care of these holy places, which Indians have only been able to visit hitherto on^ suf ferance of the Turks', who have always treated the Indians badly. The martial races of the Punjab on the other hand, and to A aa less extent in other parts in of India, care for notning so much as land -- irrigated land, and, the ambition oj every soldier is to acquire a plot of irrigated land in one of our Punjab canal colonies on which to bring up his family* The promise of gr cents of land to solders even ij deferred for ten years till irrigation is complete would j feel certain be greeted with unbounded, enthusiasm, huno.reas of Indians have spoken to me of Mesopotamia as an ideal colony - - a 'New Nun jab '(j*r Me s opot am i a like the Punj ab has its t rad i 1 1 on of five rivers) and have expressed to me the hope that in aue course we should occupy it and give India its chance of ex pansion. It is India's only chance, in every other direction expansion is impossible. We know that irrigation in has nearly reached limit. Here is a chance to provide for India’s growth for another SO years for the abundant oil springs in Mesopotamia promise to supply oil enough and to spare the necessary power to irrigate millions of acres which cannot be reached by irrigation. There is estimated to be room for 25 million people in Mesopotamia if properly developed, and the present population is probably not much over a million, mostly nomadic Arabs, for whom there vuill always be room. I have no doubt that this will have occurred to you al ready -but I hope you will excuse me for putting it before you at such length. The question will soon he under consideration and an immense lot depends on the decision arrived at. It is of course an extension of responsibility, but we cannot stand still and our responsibilities must always be great in this region, and will be the less burdensome we deal with them boldly. A few hundred thousand Indian colonists vjould be an immense accession of strength us politically andand strategically in these regions. I anticipate no trouble from Arabs or others; they will gladly accept our rule in Mesopotamia as they have done at Basrah, and, we can give them all the irrigated, land, they want and still leave many millions of acres for Indians.

August 25th, 191 h I have no idea at all ! ^hen this will x’each you. The Boiuhay mails have stopped running and we cannot trust anything to the overland post. It is extremely probable that letters will be opened and scrutinised somewhere and there is no good running the risk of getting the Government again o' us, as they might make us pay heavily in these disturbed times. I do not even care to write to you of the financial position by the overland mail and think it best not to write at all. I 'ill add to this from time to time so th- ! it nil give you a kind of resume of events here until I can get it away. On the 20th the Consul called the heads of firms together and informed us that matters between Turkey and England had come to a very critical stage and that all British vessels had been ordered to leave Turk1 eh Ports. As however there was no need for immediate act 1 onaction, no dicided to do not' i if that could cause any pahic aiuongst the natives, that is to say we agxoed to open our offices and carry on business Just as usual and make no preparatlois that could he construed in^o a slrn that ’/a were getting ready to leave. This policy has worked quite well as although there was a scaie when people heard of all the British steamers leaving Busreh, this did not. go any further when they saw the heads taking matters so calmly. Now os I write things see... as iittl . easier. A lot of troops had bum order ed to Busreh, day has come these have been countermanded, the holi along too and this has given the Turks time to cool off a hit. The Turks have also published the news that the warships which England took are to be restored to them at the end of the war# ‘ od this is a most hopeful sign. It looks If they were now trying to savo their face with the country. They have also stopped calling out more men though this may only be because they have realised how utterly incapable t ey are of disposing of the men they have got. The way they have been treating men and beasts is most horrible© Th 9 first batch that left here lost during the first day 10 men who died from exhaustion and thirst and this although the journey was done by train. When they got to Borneicha the terminus the men prayed to be allowed to do two hours march to the river where they could get water. This vas refused and that night they kill ed an officer and a large number deserted and made for the river. Some have come back to Baghdad where they are hiding and others are scattered over the country. They have collected about 5,000 Horses and it is a fact now well known that about 50 to 60 of these are dying every day and this at the main station at Baghdad. The poor brutes are dying of hunger and thirst and they are w I thin a mile of the river. The commandeering of goods has become a regular loot, soldiers break into houses and take what they want and when the unfortunate owners go to complain they are cursed at and sent away with a warning that they are under Military Taw and that they will be treated with the utmost severity if they even speak against the Military. Part of the levies have got as far as Samarrah, they found no pro vision made for them, no food, no tents or lodging of anyany sort, and they have simply looted the place. Tnoru must he of course a lot of terrible hardship in vmr hut in this case the most terrible hardships are bein? in flicted in innocent people by their om Government and fox' no earthly reason as the value of the miserable men collected is less than nil* Of course the tuxKs ai^ getting in a lot of exemption money, the total has come to over £200,000 but “?hat a drop in the bucket is this, they must throw it a my in a day and it must be consid ered that this money has been literally wrung out or the people at a time when apart from all local uroubleo things have come to a financial crisis. 27 th August. News has just come to Samar rah that of the 1,400 men of the first-batch about 1,100 only have left for Tekrit. Over 500 have deserted from this lot alone, others died and five officers have in all h~on killed. Yesterday there was a meeting at the Imperial OiuO- man Bank, of all the principal merchants. r e question that was put before the meeting was as to what was to he done at the close of the Moratorium which expires at the 3rd3rd proximo, this question having been put hy the Government through the Bunk. I was in I'uvour of dis solving the Meeting and refusing to give my answer as a protest against the way in which the places end the country are being ruined by the Government, I 'Lot the Government assure us through the Bans, that they are going to give us security both in person and property, that they are going to. pay cash for goods commandeered, that they are going to put a stop to the present reign of terror, and tnun we will ho posi tion to consider about the Moratorium'. This was the feeling of everyone and the Europeans hacked it openly but true to their natures the Baghdad merchants were scared to death at the idea of expressing even such a mild and reasonable opinion and in the end some sort of arrangement was come to whereby it was agrood Mmt ICf?, of all cumpl alias that fell between the 3rd August add 3rd September should be paid and the balance renewed for one month one quarter, this also no apply U) uVtiy ’ thing falling due between 3rd September and 3rd October, ii-Hst. at 970 to be paid on renewed amounts.5th 3eptemb-jr. 3H; This mohlllsatlon is versa than a cholera epidetile or a plague, there Is scarcely a hoao^ where It Is not stricken fey It one'way or another. 5th September. The moratorium has been officially re newed from Constantinople on tarns as given in our general letter. All we can say it Is better than nothing. There has been no great change during the past few days. Some 4,000 soldiers have been sent to Busreh and others have gone away up country. The Town becomes quieter as they move.off but still things are extremely disagreeable. We feel that we are surrounded by a most unfriendly atmosphere, every effort has been made to stir up the people and we cannot tell when trouble will come. Besides, quite apart from the con fidential information -which I have and which I cunrtot \ write the movement of troops in Busreh is a most signi ficant sign and alsmost certainly means trouble with England and Russia. Are England and Russia going to sit down and watch the Turks preparing to stab them In the back whenever the time is propitious. I u u Ink SO.L f bo. The iiiohilisation is nearly finished end a step one way or the other will soon have to be taken. The feeling here generally amongst the better class and the thinking kahoumedans, amongst all the Christians and the Jews is one of very great uneasiness and I must admit that I share it. The unfavourable progress of the war in France as marked by the change of the Govern ment to Bordeaux is addinr to this feeling because it 'ill undoubtedly encourage the Turks in Their Pro Ger man policy. However there is no good worrying over a ffairs. I can do nothing except keep as tight a grip as I can on everything. / 7th September. There has been a sort of scare amongst the English people here. A lot 01 them wanted to leave and send off the omen and children. It was proposed to send them to Kemanshah but I and one or two of the others would not hear of the Idea and we have managed to reassure the nervous ones for the time being.

On the 12th The Sultan's Birthday the Committee party arranged a grand demonstration partly in favour of the abolition of the Capitulations or rather rejoicing at their abolition for they look upon this as a fait accompli. It was arranged that the crowd were to go to the German Consulate and demonstrate in favour of the Germans and then to the Russian and English Con sulates: vhere anti-demonstrations rare to be made. Things might have become very nasty but the Vali Pasha put his foot down and confined the affair to the ‘ orth GateGate ‘/here speeches vere made. The linu taken by most of the speakers was that foreigners are in this country by suffrance and should therefore he made to suffer. It must be admitted that this Vali Djavid Pasha has be haved much better than .ms expected. _ He is as many of the Turks are, a friend of England and France at heart but has to disguise his sentiments and it is now divulging no secret to tell you that he gave the Consul the most solemn assurances as to the safety of English people whatever comes to pass. Generally things seem better, the success of the French and British armies is looked on very favourably by the Christians and Jews who a me feeling a good deal easier and there have been no further scares amongst our people.

Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, for information, the translation of a note prepared by the informer Muhammad Amin and left with His Highness the Sultan, who handed it to the Political Agent, Maskat, on latter’s asking for it. The Political Agent reports that His Highness seemed very anxious to know what Muhammad Amin might say to me at Bushire. As a matter of fact, Muhammad Amin hardly mentioned His Highness to me, except to say that the fact that he had been sent for through His Highness the Sultan by the Political Agent (this was in accordance with my instructions) had gone far to destroy His Highness’s confidence in Muhammad Amin and, therefore, grieviously injured the latter. He added “ How could a man like the Sultan be ment, Simla. JL. ment, Simla. there for some time and has no intention of leaving at present so far as I am aware. conversant with State affairs and political secrets” i 32 Translation of an Arabic letter. During my stay at Basrah and association with one of the prominent men there I got acquainted with certain political matters which I state for your consideration (or information). It is not unknown to politicians that the Ottoman peoples split up into two parties after securing constitutional government. One of the parties is (Unionist) and the other and greater is Itilafi ( ?). The Ittihadis (Unionists) are inclined to republic and the Itilafis ( ?) to the maintenance of the Caliphate as every sane person clearly understands that the various elements of the Ottoman peoples have rallied to the one word “ maintenance of the Empire and the Caliphate ”. This is especially true in regard to the Arab element and two-thirds of Anatolians, who are rigidly in favour of the maintenance of the Caliphate. The number of the republicans is thus much less than the Khalifatis (Royalists). To look to the Muslim element outside the Ottoman Empire, there are about 550 millions of men in Asia who desire the maintenance of the Caliphate and, therefore, supposing that the Ottomans w'ere stripped of the halo of the Caliphate, the Muslims would naturally create (illegible) another Caliph and would rally to his standard but this would be attended with harm at the present time. For instance, at the time of the Caliphate of Ali bin Talib (The fourth successor of the Holy Prophet) the Muslims were all of one common belief (faith) and there was no seism whatever. After Ali, the Muslim peoples split up into various sects, each of the sects zealously following the views of its own founder. Thus, some followed the then Caliph, while others oppose him, the various sects setting up their own Imams. Of these the greatest sect was the Shia, who adored Ali bin Talib, and millions of them opposed the (next) Caliph and formed a distinct body. In those old times, ignorance and fanaticism were greater than what they are to-day and the founders of religious sects took advantage of the ignor ance of the peoples. Although ignorance still exists yet in comparison to former times there is now much more general enlightenment. During these three years past, many men have been trying to secure the title of Khalifak for their names. They are (1) The Khedive Abbas Pasha of Egypt, (2) Husain Pasha, the Sharif of Mecca, (3) Saiyid Talib Bey, the Naqib of Basrah, (4) Imam Yahya of Sanna a, Yemen, (5) Idris ?, Yemen, (6) Bin Saud of Najd. With the exception of Saiyid Talib none of these aspirants has any serious hold on the minds of those concerned. Saiyid Talib is a native of Basrah which town is in the neighbourhood of Persia, and the majority of the Persians, being Shias, love Ali and his descendants, of whom Saiyid Talib is one, as he is descended from Hasan son of Ali. Some of the most prominent men in Persia have promised to accept his Baia't (allegiance) in case occasion should arise for so doing. Secondly, the (Muslim) Indians and all the (Muslim) mhabRants of Asia have an undescribable regard for the Niqabab (office ot JSaqib). This statement is borne out by the fact that numbers of Zuwwar (pilgrims) mostly Indians and Bohras preferably go through Baghdad tor no other purpose except for visiting the (shrines of the) ancestors of Saiyid lahb, who, too, has made a long tour m India in recent years with the obiect of ennsting support for his candidacy for this title or designation. At that tune he was enabled to arrange that in the event of the Ottomans persisting in their efforts to do away with the Caliphate and establishing a republic the Khal^h lnShmS ° f India ^ Sh0uld certa inly accept his JBaiat (allegiance) as But there cannot be two Khalifahs at a time on the earth nor in one illeqihle (country), for Bin Saud is a rival claimant for this (honour) and this fact became clear to Saiyid Talib, who understood that he could not free himself from the rivalry of Bin Saud, and so bethought himself to try and get some oUe r d^ncuon. Tims, takmg advantage ot the Government’s engSemeTt he reinfo the (Tnrki^rT ? with Bin Saud, and, after securing tne terns ot the (turkish) garrison and the authorities by bribery, induced Bin Saudio take possession of Najd and Al Hisa together with the siirroundin»s the gair^sonj 0 . 8 St0reS th “ 8 wlthout a stroke w opposition (on the part of* 3 i At the same time, in order to safeguard himself against (the action of) the Turkish Government, Saiyid Talib adopted a device in respect of Shaikh Mubarak-as-Subah of Kuwait and Sirdar Khazal Khan (of Muhammerah) „ivj na it out to the Government that being his neighbours these two Shaikhs were readv to help him, if Government so desires, by men and money m re taking Al Hasa and that this had been definitely agreed upon between them. It was on this account that, as an act of friendship, Saiyid Talib endeavoured to secure for these two Shaikhs the distinction of the hirst Class Order of Mejidi and virtually succeeded therein. The appointment of Sulaiman ? Pasha as Wall and Commander of troons at Basrah was due to the problem of Najd and the insurrection of Bin Saud as well as to the actions of Saiyid Talib Bey. This appointment was made at a time when the Central Government had many important problems to deal with, and the Wall was entrusted with secret instructions and was to have a free hand in all matters. As a matter of precaution, he was escorted by a sufficient force. Before the Wall’s arrival at Basrah, Saiyid Tahb ordered the local house-proprietors not to let a single house on rent to the Wall within the town of Basrah. The object of this was that, in the event of the least opposition being shown by the Wali, he may be easily killed outside the town as was the ease of the murder of the former Commander, Farid Bey. Thus, be made the Wali to dwell in the house of Kbazal Khan (Chief of Muhammerah) which is situated on the bank of the large Basrah river some H tours distance from Basrah There a body of the Shaikh’s men was stationed as a guard for he nrote tion of his life. Later, he cunningly persuaded the Wall to believe that the problem of Bin Saud had arisen as a surprise to the Government and that the P masterv in the Gulf was formerly Islam’s, but when the Government gave up her position and the British Government was granted the privilege gave up nm P o{ the peoples C ame to be neglected and they became disloval to the Government, hut that it was not necessary that the Government should send her forces to fight Bin Saud, but he (Saiyid lalib) would, with the Government’s approval, make the best arrangement and thereby enlist Bin gaud’s loyalty and that if the latter proved refractory, then the former would himself rale i force with the help of the other chiefs and fight for the Govern- W When the Wali saw this attitude of Saiyid Talih; opposed as it was to former’s opinion about the latter, he informed the Porte of this and, as result, the Government entrusted Saiyid Talib with this task on getting th.s intima- «on and then the position of Bin Sand with respect to the Government was discussed and settled by means of two agreements of which one was ordwaiy (public) and the other secret.

Seven mountain guns which are probably additional to these batteries mentioned in my telegram No. 999 and may include quick-firing pieces have been sent down to Basrah. It is also stated by the Consul at Baghdad that he believes that both the Kerkuk and Mosul Divisions have gone to West. As in case of Baghdad Division, the Consul at Baghdad gives Mosul Regiments at four battalions but from reports received^from Aleppo, Regiment* consisting of only two battalions appear to have arrived at Baghdad. The report from Aleppo is probably correct. As regards numbers of men, there is no doubt that there are third battalions in existence but before they can be incorporated with others they require to be trained. The so-called fourth battalions are merely masses of men at depots. Th« same remarks apply to the thirty-seventh Division at Baghdad. Addressed to Foreign Office.

Again, from another report received by the Sultan, it is clear that after the Id festival the rebels contemplate attacking Maskat.

Saiyid Talib is notoriously untrustworthy and slippery, and it is not improbable that after his visit to Bushire he will proceed to Constantinople.2 My own opinion is that the Turks wish to gain time with the Germans, and we may succeed in spinning out the situation for some mouths. If, i n the meantime, it became known to the Turks that the British Government was encouraging a disruptive movement of Arab provinces, it might hasten events. Please treat this as very confidential.

I had an interview yesterday with the Pir Saheb of Baghdad; but owing to the presence of others I was unable to discuss Turkey’s position and behaviour freely. However, we are to meet again next week. The Pir Saheb told me that the war has caused great economic difficulty in Arabia, and that their trade is at a complete standstill and he expressed a sincere hope that peace would be declared at the earliest possible moment. He also expressed his satisfaction that the panic in Bombay had been confined to certain classes of Hindus, and that so far the Muhammadans were standing firm. He pur chased samples of the things which the children of the Musalman Girl's Orphanage are making for Indian soldiers at the front, and made a donation of Rs. 200 to our Orphanage Funds. ******** Telegram P., dated (and received) the 30th October 1914. From—The Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Clear the line. I have had au interesting interview with my News Agent at Hodeida. He thinks that the objective of the Turks, if they declare war,O » 4 will be the recovery of Kars and Batornn, though the concentration of their troops at A1 Akaba is probably intended for operations (?) against Egypt. A wholesome dread of our naval power is entertained by the Turks at Hodeida, who have transferred their military stores and arsenal to Bajil in the hills. According to the News Agent, Turkey will be forced to declare war against Great Britain. He thinks that Idrisi is not likely to come to terms with the Turks, who, however, fear his occult powers. As regards Imam, he says that Mahmud Nadim, Governor-General of Yemen, is the only one whose policy saves a rupture between Imam and the Turks. Further, Turkish subjects, firstly, Zaranik, whose port is A1 Taif, and, secondly, A1 Hakam, at Khokandi, are thorns in the side of the Turks. (End of news obtained from Agent.) It would be possible for us, later on, to win over to our side both these tribes, and, I believe that the well-known Sheikhs Ahmed Noman of Bagariya and I bn Nasir Mukbil of Kumaira are wavering in their allegiance to Turkey.

Please refer to your telegram No. 2356 W., dated the 28th instant, transmitting Government of India’s telegram No. S. 983 of the 27th October. In a private letter from the Sultan of Lahej to his friend the Imam, the latter has been informed of the sanction accorded by the Government of India to his request for the services of a man to give instructions in the manufacture of gunpowder, since it was through the Sultan that the Imam’s wish was originally communicated to the Government of India. The Sultan has also addressed a letter to the Imam with a view to sounding him as to his standing and feelings towards us. Pending the Imam’s reply, I recommend that no “friendly overtures” should be made to him by the Government of India or the Eesident at Aden. It is also inadvisable at this stage to entertain questions relating to the supply of arms and ammunition. Owing to the progress of events since I telegraphed on the 15th August, it is impossible just at present to gauge accurately the relations subsisting between Mahmud .Nadim, Governor-General of Yemen, and the Imam. D The confidential agent of the Idrisi is still here (please see the first paragraph of my secret telegram of the 11th September). He assures me that the Imam and the Idrisi have not come to terms, and, further, that the Idrisi will never come to an agreement with the Turks. At this juncture it is the Idrisi then whom we might more profitably approach by sending him a verbal menage through his agent. The agent is one Haj Idris, who is extremely anti-1 urkish, very Inendiy towards us and known to the Egyptian authorities^ Addressed to the Government of Bombay and repeated to the Govern ment ot India and the Secretary of State for India. vauvern Telegram P., No. 1309, dated (anf received) the 30th October 1914, From the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire To-The Wa^ the Government of India in the Foreign and Politieal Defart- follows':- 6 29tU iDSl;aUt the Britisb C ° nSul at Moham “erah telegraphed as . ; informed by the Sheikh of Mohammernh that the Porte havimr heard that Bin baud and Bin iiashid were about to fight, telegraphed toSaiyid Talib requesting him to write to the two parties concerned and stop them. Saiyid Talib replied that a visit would be productive of better results than letters, but that by adopting the former course his departure for Constantinople would be delayed. Finally, he received instructions to proceed to interview Bin Saud. As matters now stand, therefore, Saiyid TaliVs visit to Constantinople has been deferred, and he is to leave in four or five days for Nejd. To-day the Sheikh communicated some proposals from Saiyid Talib, but admitted that they were preposterous. He is going to see the Saiyid again on the subject. It appears, however, that a guarantee that Saiyid Talib should be recognised as Ruler of Basrah under our protection, rather on lines of Koweifc, is, at present, a sine qua non ?In any further communication on the subject, please quote no. 73215/14. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, * London. oir: - with reference to your letter of the 19th instant, trans nutting copy of a telegram from the Viceroy of India respect ing the protection of British interests in Bagdad, I am directed by Secretary Sir E.

(November 20, \0 30 a.m.) X XIAVE received copy from a secret source of a telegram that the Ulemas ot Mesopotamia have addressed to Shah, Ministers, clergy, Medjliss, and press stating that England, Ilussia, and France have always oppressed Islamic btates with sole object of stamping out the faith and that their, true intentions ha\e been made manifest by their attack on Turkey. All true Moslems aie called upon to defend the faith, the sacred places, and their homes, and they are ^ reminded that annihilation of unbelievers is commanded. From Nedjef special attention is called to Mohammerah and Basra as most important frontier posts of Islam, and Persian Government are summoned to order Sheikh of Mohammerah to go to the assistance of Turkey. These telegrams will probably not be delivered to their destinations, as I have received previous assurances that circulation of such messages would not be permitted. Still it is not impossible that their purport may leak out. It is uncertain how much effect they might have on the people, but an^ unfavourable ground has been prepared by spirit of leader that appeared in £ Baad, a much read paper, attacking Prussia for her action at Tabriz in arresting consuls and subjects of States at war with her. (Sent to India, Shiraz, and Bushire.)COXFIDEXTTAL U N Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—{Received November 19, 3'55 a.m.) Tehran, November 18, 1914. (No. 311.) {November 18, 5 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 294 of 17th November. Russian Minister had no instructions in the sense of Sir G. Buchanan’s telegram No. G52 of last night. Persian Government has already protested officially to Russian Legation and to Turkish Embassy against violation by their respective troops of Pe i sian territory. It would appear an open question as to which was the first aggressor. Persian Government seem to be inclined to hold that, if Russia did not actually invade Turkish territory through Azerbaijan before Turks entered Persian territory, her action in increasing number of her troops in Persia, and in openly despatching :[ large force from Khoi towards the Van was evidence of intention to make use' 1 of Persian territory for incursion into Turkey, whereas Turkish troops would appear not to have actually entered Persia until Russians by moving out of Khoi left the road open for them to get behind them, which they have done. In a further note calling attention to the fact that, as was foreseen when Russia was invited to withdraw her troops, Persian neutrality had been violated by both parties, Russian Minister will be asked to put in writing certain verbal assurances that he has given to the effect that action taken by Russia is in no sense reckoning on the intention to violate Persian integrity, and that after the war is over indenendence of Persia will be reaffirmed, Azerbaijan be re-evacuated, and compensation paid for damage caused by hostilities on Persian soil. I am convinced that in taking this step, which they say is considerably less extensive in its aims than demands/ they have been advised by Russian Minister himself to put forward, Persian Government are acting solely on their own initiative and have not been animated by Turkish or other advisers. Members of Cabinet are of opinion that it is in Persia’s best interests to maintain truly strict neutrality, against violations of which they will protest impartially. Their sympathies are certainly rather with us than against us, but they fear public opinion would disapprove of open espousal of the cause of the two neighbours who alone can do them real harm or real good. Situation is and must remaii^- ^ most delicate , one. There is naturally a strono- party with pro-Islamic tendencies, but I am given to understand [? that this] partv has been losing ground of late before arguments put forward by strong and influential clerical-political party that favours an alliance with us. The clerical section of this party, with whom I am on friendly terms, has sent me spontaneous assurances that during ensuring first ten days of Moharrem no pro-Turkish sermons will be preached, and advantages of siding with us will be sedulously put before the people. Messages have also been sent to Ulemas of Mespotamia and of Shiah faithfully telling them programme of Persian Government, and that priests do not favour a Turkish policy, and exhorting them not to preach holy war, of an intention to do which there have been some signs at Mohammerah and Kermanshah. So far situation is favourable, but any incident, such as a Turkish success or some thoughtless treatment of a mullah by Russians, as has recently occurred at Kermanshah, may inflame public opinion and turn people against us. New Medjliss, which must be opened soon, may prove dangerous body, as it is largely composed of priests. I have advised the Cabinet to arrange with present majority, which is well-disposed, to so contrive matters that as soon as officers'of the house have been chosen and committees formed, for which work will be found, house shull vote itself holidays, so as not to remain permanently sitting.

From — His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. The following telegram has been addressed by me to the Foreign Office, J ondon, and repeated to Cairo:— Begins. Military Attache inclines to the opinion that the figures of the Germans given in my telegram No. 1007 are exaggerated and that in any case they must he taken to include some of the officers now in Syria who probably number about thirty in all with some more on their way to train troops in Mesopotamia. A good many of these officers are those of original mission employed round Constantinople up to present, but there is no doubt that a good many fresh officers have been arriving in small groups or singly. It is pretty well clear as regards the Naval officers that Naval parties are on their way both to the Persian Gulf and Akaba as well as smaller groups to the coast ports of Syria. In addition to the “ Goeben” and “Breslau” officers and others who have subsequently arrived, German reserve marine officers are available in considerable numbers. It is not impossible that floating mines may be let loose at Akaba penetrating into the Red Sea; in the Persian Gulf in addition to the possibility of the reception of the “ Emden”, the defence of the water way will no doubt be prepared. Military Attache considers it very probable that consignment of mines has now actually got as far as Maan. It is reported by the Consul at Damascus that fifty Germans, wounded, it is presumed, in East Africa, arrived quite recently at Akaba. The arrival in Constantinople of Austrian officers and sailors is regarded as also possible, although there is at present no actual confirmation of this.

He says he hears that the Turks intend to lay the mines as soon as possible at Shamsumiya and then at the Mohammerah Bar and Fao. The Turks also intend to station troops and guns on the bank opposite the mouth of the Karun river. “It seems to me that it would be a violation of the treaty rights of the port of Mohammerah if mines were sown at Mohammeran Bar and at Eao. This action on the part of the Turks, should, if possible, be stopped by us. “ The Sheikh is greatly exercised in mind at the prospect of the river being blocked in this manner, thus preventing British vessels from proceeding up, and he fears that the Turks may turn their attention to Mohammerah and lie is powerless to offer resistance. I concur in the Sheikh’s view, and recommend that some measures should be taken by the Government of India, viz., by either despatching war-ships or adopting other means, to safeguard British interests at Mohammerah, since Persia has not the power to defend her neutrality. “ I have informed the Senior Naval Officer.” 6 Telegram P., No. S. 948, dated the 21st October 1914.

Seyyid lalib mentioned that he had engaged a passage by the S. S. “ Albistan ” which was due to leave in three or four days* time. 'The Sheikh endeavoured to dissuade him from proceeding, on the ground that it would be very danger ous to visit Constantinople at the present moment. Seyyid Talib, however, declared that he bad decided to go adding that, unless some settlement with us could be made, it would be dangerous to prevaricate.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah, To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. The Shaikh paid me a visit to-day and general situation apparently ! troubled him greatly. He says that he would not be able to resist Turkish ' attacks on Muhammerah, now that Turks have collected troops in Basrah and posted guns down river. Possibility of the departure of our sloops worried him a good deal for, in his opinion, Turks are certainly bent on war and if sloops left, probability of attacks on Abadan and Muhammerah would be much increased. Persia here obviously cannot defend her neutrality and I beg to uro-e from I local point of view that, while local Turkish attitude is so full of menace, presence of our sloops is most necessary to protect our important interests in Arabistan, Abadan and Muhammerah. I presume that it is no good protesting against new Turkish regulations, which Muhammerah naturally objects to and are only intended to annoy. Telegram P., No. 138, dated the 9th October 1914. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushirc. I was told by Shaikh of Muhammerah at yesterday’s visit that Saiyid Talib had some proposals to make to me. I understood from Khazal that if Saiyid Talib was recognised as a local Chief and promised protection he would ium 2 return exercise his influence either (1) preliminary to an attack on Basrah by us, cause an Arab revolt, or (2) in order to minimise resistance excite disaffec tion among troops and Arabs. It was thought, however, by tiie Shaikh that, if I met Saiyid Talib i would understand better and last night I accordingly did so. No definite proposals came from him but he said that the Turks were bent on war, but before the war started but not after he could help : lie asked me to telegraph to jou and ascertain if you could either meet him or, if not, authorise me to do so in order that some arrangement might be come to. He is staying at his estate down the river for the next three or four days and could meet you at some fixed time if you agree at the mouth of the Bamashir. I told him tiiat I would let you know and he is anxious for a reply. My personal opinion is that definite arrangements with a man of Saiyid Talib’s calibre are better avoided.

Plecse see Mobammerah Consul’s telegram No. 154, dated the 22nd instant, regarding Saiyid Talib. It is most desirable that Saiyid Talib should be dhsuaded, if possible, from going to Constantinople. In order to secure this end you should negotiate with him at once in the sense of Government of India ^telegram No. 854 S., dated the 6th instant, viz., that we wish him to remain at Basrah, and, in the event of war breaking out between Great Britain and Turkey, to co-operate with Bin Saud and the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait in our interests and safeguard Europeans, &amp;c. in Basrah. In return for this, we would guarantee him (1) that his date gardens should he immune from taxation, (2) that we would protect him against reprisals by the Turks, (3) that we would maintain all hereditary privileges of himself and Nakib. It may be added by you that in the event of war being averted, he could rely on our continued support and liberal treatment. You will doubtless conduct the negotiations through the medium of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah who will, if he thinks it desirable, employ the services of the Shaikh.

The S.S. “ Amatoonga” and another ship were subjected to rifle fire. The Turks have seized the Port Office at Mohammerah and have turned out the British. They also expressed their intention of taking over the Port Office at Basrah. H.M.S. “ Espiegle ' (gunboat) lying at Mohammerah was given 24 hours to leave. The S.S. “ Kassara” w^as warned not to return. When the British Consul called on the Yali of Basrah for an explanation, he closed his door in the Consul’s face and refused to see him. Some 20,000 armed Turkish troops are encamped behind a date palm grove near Pao. The state of the country is such that the Consul called Messrs. Lynch’s river steamer to Mohammerah beyond which Port no British trading vessels are allowed to proceed.The British gunboats “ Espiegle**, “Odin” and H.I.M.S. “Dalhousie” (converted into an armourer cruiser) vrere in Turkish waters when the “ Kassara” left, and H.M.S.

As regards Seyyid Talib’s departure, which I told the Sheikh that it was most desirable he should defer, the Sheikh thought that he would not do so. He suggested that to achieve our object the best way would be to delay the S.S. “ Albistan ” for a few days at the Bar or at Bushire since it is Seyyid Talib s intention to meet the vessel, as she is about to leave the Bar, by going out in the Sheikh of Koweit’s launch. According to Sheikh what Seyyid Talib wants is, as reported in my telegram No. 138 of the 9th October, to be recognised under our protection as Sheikh or Amir of Basrah.

I ha.ve, &amp;c., (Signed) Louis Mallet. His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, &amp;c., 8ic., Stc.l\o . 52. ERZEHOUM, 14th October, 1914. Sir: ~ 1 have the honour to report that the 'A! bairak* (Ked Flag) the local ' nion and Progressist organ, in its number of the 8th instant, contains a long inflated and somewhat obscure article entitled M For Country 11 , referring to a telegraphic report published here by the Union end Progressist telegraphic agency of recent san guinary encounters in Cairo and Alexandria between Egyptian soldiers who were being sent to the war in Europe and British soldiers. The article says that Moslems who, like Egyptian and Indian soldiers and like the rebels in the Yemen, sacrifice themselves for England, die a shameful death in her cause,'and are traitors to their real country which is Islam, a man’s real country being the domain over the world of his religion and his cultures. Fortunately the “A! bairak 1 ’ has little circulation or influence. The ftis b ritannic Majesty*s Ambassador, Sec., he. , &amp;c., Constantinople*The two Union and Progressist delegates here, Hilrai Bey, who is reported on by Mr* Acting Consul Bullard in his despatch Ho. 1 of the 17th January, 1914, and the Red Crescent doctor Bsha-ad-din Shakir who arrived from Constantinop]e two months ago, are virtually governing the Vilayet, having complete control over the Union and Progressist Defterdar who is Acting Vali. Doctor Baha-ad-dm Shakir was for years an exile in France under the old regime, and is a cultivated man speaking excellent French, but he like Hilrai Bey, is following here a policy of Turkish Meslam chauvinism. They now and then make short tours through frontier villages preaching to the Moslem villagers. In the last two or three weeks many Armenian soldiers have been permanently disarmed and put to spade work, thou$i this disarming of Armenian soldiers has, 1 hear, been stopped for the present. The Govern ment are doubtful of the willingness of Armenian soldiers to fight Russia. dome Armenian bands have 1 hear been organised in the Caucasus to go over into Turkey in the event of a massacre of Armenians, 1 know really nothing of this organisation, but the Government may probably have heardheard of it. It is vaguely, but perhaps with good reason believed that the Grovemirsnt are arming ho si eras who are not of military age to serve as a sort of militia reserve in the event of war. On the other hand four or five Loslems have been ostentatiously reported in the local newspaper as having been sentenced to 45 days imprisonment each for having aras in their possession. As 1 had the honour to report by telegraph, two Russian subjects were expelled from here to Russia four weeks ago having, it Armenian soldiers in the Turkish service. One of the two has since been invited to return by the Turkish authorities who say it was all a mistake in his case, but he has not accepted the invitation. There have been in the last three or four weeks searches for arms in the houses of five or six Annenians, one Turk, and one Persian, in this town, and one search three days ago of an entire large Armenian village about two hours distant. Nothing was found in these searches except two obsolete rifles in the village. Six men of the village have been brought to Srzeroum where they are in prison. About thirty Armenian is said, been suspected of exciting disaffection among villagersvillagers I f&amp;ssin iiaLVQ n&gt;Xso Ijsan 100^00 in Erzerourn prison within the last few days. An Armenian Catholic priest of that Gaza has been sentenced to 45 days’ imprisonment for, as 1 hear, telling a Kurd of a report which has appeared in a Constantinople Armenian newspaper of the Crown Prince of Germany having been wounded and of twenty-eight German ships having been sunk. Two Armenian townsmen, one of them a leading Tashn&amp;gist, have been for the last few weeks, as political suspects, in Erzeroum prison where they remain. Altogether the repressive measures against Armenians Imve hitherto not been very severe or extensive. The general uneasiness and depression are chiefly due to the apprehension of war and to the imp^overishment caused by the mobilization taking away the able bodied men, the very widespread billeting of soldiers in both Christian and loslem villages where they seize forage and provisions, and the universal military requisitions without payment. I do not hear of violence on the part of regular soldiers, though a few cases of violence of officers in villages are reported. Owing to the excellent harvest there has asaa yet been no severe dearth of food, nor indeed have prices of locally produced food risen, but import and export trade has almost entirely ceased and the town, and village populations both Moslem and Christian in the Vilayet are near rain * For example, 120,000 sheep are said to have been seized for the army in the Vilayet. uood cows are nom being sold by the villagers at the unheard of cheap price of one and a half lira each, the reason being the fenr that the -cows may be seised by the army, A great part of the oxen and nearly all the horses and mules have been seized for the army I gather that even the Moslems, and especially the moneyed ones, eagerly desire a return to the normal state of things* The two army corps now kept near the Russian frontier in this Vilayet dc not inspire much confidence as a fighting force* Desertions are frequent, and notably ef Laze Moslems* The Kurdish tribal light cavalry, who 1 may mention are said to be molesting Armenian villagers to p serious extent, are expressing discontent at the loss which the mobilization causes them. Rations for the array are very insufficient, there being not enough flour mills, sickness,sickness, though not very alarming, continues to be con siderable, and there is a great deficiency of warm clothing for the approaching severe winter. Only rifles and ammunition are now perhaps sufficient* There is of course wild talk of an invasion of Russia, but 1 doubt whether it is really expected by any one. The two frontier incidents of a foil night ago, of a Russian aeroplane over Turkish territory having been fired at and having returned to Russia, and of a handful1 of coesacks with their officer having been arrested in Turkish territory, have caused no excitement. An out break against Armenians of the now smouldering passions of fanaticism and greed seems most necessary to guard against. It is hoped that the newly appointed Vall, TaJisin Bey, 7ali of Van, who is expected to be here in a week or two, will maintain the good reputation which he has won at Van. 1 have, &amp;c*, (Signed) J.

I have consequently instructed Resident at Aden to await further instructions, and have not yet communicated your telegram 1369 to General Barrett who has with him Sir P. Cox, who fully understands position and is doing everything to encourage Arab movement on our side. We must face fact that Arabs generally are not unlikely to forget for time being their grievances against their co-religionists, the Turks, and either to remain passive or to join against us, and it would appear desirable to back conciliation with a declaration of our intention to resist force by force. I propose, therefore, to approve issue of proposed declaration by Resident at Aden to 1 urkish Arab leaders and also a communication in the same sense to Arabs of Aden Protectorate. The question of arming Aulakis and Yafais is under consideration, but I think such action will be premature at present. As regards Persian Gulf Arabs much will depend on our and in meantime we can safely leave the matter to Sir further instructions. success at Basrah, Berov Cox without1 In any further communication on the subject, please quote &gt;--0. 71173/14. anil address— The Under-Secretary of State, v Foreign Office, \ London. 33TS Office 1914.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a translation of an Arabic pamphlet which is believed to have emanated from Basrah and is now being distributed in Muhammerah. Translation from Arabic. (Seal with the following inscription :—) “He (God) has the right cause. Committee for endeavouring to unite the adherents of the Qoran.” I take refuge in God from the cursed Satan. In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate.4 “Verily God has purchased from the true believers their lives and proper ties as there is paradise for them, so that they may fig lit for the religion of God and slay and be slain. This is a true promise given in the Pentateuch, the Bible and* the Q.oran, and whoever fulfils his vow to God, you should give him the glad tidings as regards what ye have been bought for, that is, a great reward.” Qoran. GBEETINGS to all Muslims who believe in God and the last day and who remain in the East or West of the world. Oli my brethren in God! one of the facts which are doubted by no one and which are not questioned by any sane person and which have become obvious and established truths is this that the European nations, the worshippers of the Cross, have resolved since centuries to oppose Islam, to hate Muslims, and, further, to annihilate their religion, to efface their sovereignty and kingdom from the face of the Earth. So, thou seest them attacking us, Muslims, every day, encroaching upon our towns and countries as they desire : and their fanaticism requires no proof or argument, and has been expressed on several occasions by their leaders and statesmen, such as Gladstone, Honoto (?) and Peter the Great. The actions and proceedings of their clergy and missionaries have proved that these infidels, who have deviated from the religion of God and his Apostle, strongly desire to destroy the Kaabah and the tomb of the Prophet, to burn up the great Qoran, to extirpate religion, to convert Muslims and to baptise them in every possible way, as was done several centuries ago in Andalusia and several days ago in the Balkans. If ye, Oh Muslims, do not remember the atrocities of Europe and her barbarous tyranny, have you not seen and heard what has been done by her yesterday in Tripoli, Khorasan and Azarbaijan and the countries they have usurped in the Balkans ? These wull suffice for warning you. It was only yesterday when the savages of the Balkans in Bulgaria, Servia, Montenegro and Greece were instigated by the master politicians of Europe against your old men and people and burned them with guns and rifles, attacked your children and infants whom they butchered, violated your women-folk with everv sort of shamelessness, attacked your mosques and prayer-places and the tombs of your forefathers which they destroyed and burned up. To-day they bark and rush at each other for the remainder of your possessions which has been spared by their swords and guns. You, Oh Muslims, are in the last breath of your life and glory. _ Avail yourselves of this valuable opportunity when God’s enemies are fighting against one another, unite in a religious union, assemble under the flag of Islam, obey your Sultan and the authorities placed over you, attack these infidels, turn them out of your country, murder them, wage a holy war like one who defends his life, his leligion and his honour. Each of you should assist the other in this holy war, which is incumbent upon you, and even women and little children should do what they can and the learned TJlemas should do what they can with their lives, properties and whse opinion, as has been commanded by God in His holy book (when He says) : “ Eight them, and God will cause them to suffer at your hands, and will defeat them and give you victory over them and will gladden the hearts of the true believers. Move ye, whether ye have a heavy or light burden, and fight in the cause of God with your lives and properties.” {Translation from the Persian part of the paper.) GREETINGS to all our Muslim brethren. j' mos ^ ^ as sa ^ • “ War hath been ordained on you and is disliked by you. Perhaps you dislike a thing and it is good for you.” Oh religious brethren ! Oh community of Muslims ! Oh those who say ‘There is no God but God” ! Oh those who are hopeful of Muhammad’s inter- cession I It is several years that we say, and it is said by others, that foreigners .are about to extirpate the true religion, to destroy the kaabah, to demolish the Prophet s sepulchre, and to destroy the Qoran. They aim at effacing the holy name of Isiam Horn the face of the earth and to record this fact in the pagesof history. The task of opposing foreigners does not lay on one single tribe with the exclusion of others, because when He said “Ok true believers” in the Qoran, the God of Islam did not mean one nation but addressed all the Muhammadan’s, whether Arabs, Persians, Turks, Kurds and Indians, &amp;c. 1 The object of foreigners is also all the sections of the Muslims without distinc tion of caste. It is their desire to extirpate the root so that the boughs and branches may not grow. We said these until we were tired out and others also said so until they were tired out. The cries of unseen speakers in the Islamic World disturbed even the heavens but unfortunately we could not create a public feeling and a considerable awakening of the Islamic World. Oh God of Islam ! Oh holy spirit of the Prophet! Oh holy spirits of God’s Apostles I throw a generous glance at the Islamic World, so that these people w T ho sleep on the bed of negligence may take warning and liberate the Islamic World from the yoke of foreigners. Oh religious brethren, we cannot record the action taken by the foreigners against you. All that is known cannot be said. Wake up. Consider the day (of misfortune for) religion, Qoran, Kaabah, the holy shrines of Islam, and our lives, property, honour, country, nation and government, of which we are afraid. The predictions we made years ago have now been materialised. Has the time not arrived for you to unite ? Has the opportunity not come for protecting Islam and the honour of Islamic ladies ? Is it not the duty of Muslims and citizens to maintain the dignities of religion and country? Is it the duty of foreigners to guard your honour ? The Islamic religion is the soul of your lives. Wherever the call to prayer is given it is the country of Muslims. The honour of Islam is the honour of all Muslims without distinction of caste. It is undesirable to record the points concerning the conditions of to-day. Briefly, Oh Muslims, this is the day for the great holy war to be waged by Islam, that is to say, the Qoran has to oppose the Cross, Kaabah has to face Pagoda, and the call to prayer is to fight the bell. Shortly speaking, Islam has now a war against heathenism. Anyone who is a Muhammadan, should now sacrifice his life and property in the cause of Islam before the foreigners can take his life and property from him. I announce in the Islamic World that this is not the* time for slumber: this is not the time for stinginess: this is not the time for luxurious life. While I see that 30,000 German women take part in the war for defending their country and' honour and sacrifice their lives in this direction, why should we, who claim manliness, spare our lives in defending our dear religion and dear country ? Oh Ulemas ! Oh Clergy ! Oh leading men 1 Oh men of Islam! Oh preachers! Oh public classes of Muhammadans! be prepared for defending the Holy Qoran, the House of God, the holy sepulchres of the Prophet and of the Imams, and for safeguarding the honour of your women and daughters and use your life and property in the cause of God and obey the commands of the great Islamic Power which is a strong barrier for checking the supremacy of heathenism over Islam and is the first servant of the religion and the Holy precincts. « oh ye who have believed, obey God and the Prophet and those who are in authority over you.” GREETINGS. Translation from Arabic. (Seal with the following inscriptions;) “ He (God) has the right cause. Committee for endeavouring to unite the adherents of the Qoran.” Praise be to God w T ko hns favoured his slaves (creatures) with the true religion and who had taught the same to them all, whether Angels, men or gennis, as is described in the Great Qoran (where it says) “Verily the true religion with God is Islam ”, and peace and blessings be on the guide of the people to the right path, the greatest instructor, the teacher of the good, the grandest intercessor on the day of resurrection, our Lord, Muhammad Mustafa, the chosen apostle, the leader of the prophets, who was kind and generous to the true believers, and on his prosperity w ho followed his footsteps in guidance6 and enlightenment, and on his generous afostles, the leaders of Islam, who used to answer the holy call to holy wars. Secondly, we preach Islam to our Muslim brethren throughout the world and remind them of what is already known to them and what is urged upon, the Islamism (which ordains that) Muslim brotherhood in religion outweighs brotherhood in relation and that they should form a solid front in all circums tances which concern them : that each of them should assist the other so that thou mayest see them united in God’s religion, endeavouring all to uphold God’s cause, fraternising in the way of God, assisting each other in cheeking encroachments on the part of God’s enemies, in the same way as their religion hinds those remaining in the east (of the world) to help those remaining in the west and vice versa, and in the same way as is said in the verse “ Move ye whether under heavy or light burden ”, and according to other ordinances given in the Qoran and explained by the Prophet. There is no need to record all the verses and authentic traditions in this connection as they are well known to the learned men of religion in detail and to all the true believers in substance. Therefore, Oh slaves of God! Oh adherents of the Qoran ! Oh those who believe in God and his apostle, our Lord Muhammad, of high dignity, is it desirable for those possessing sense of honour, dignitv, valour and nobility, and is it desirable for men of religious and noble characters to see foreigners everywhere and in every direction, assisting, helpino-, uniting and endeavouring with all their might to overrun the Muslim countries, to turn them out therefrom, to disperse them, to seduce them from their religion, to destroy them, to enjoy them with their wives and daughters, to captivate their children, to violate their honour, to take possession of their countries, and to make away with their properties, while they remain negli gent, indifferent, forgetful, thoughtless, contemptible, cringing and eating and drinking like animals or rather worse, and remaining deaf without hearing the reports of what befalls their brethren in different parts of the world, such as calamities, catastrophes and inflictions by way of murder, hanging, burning, destruction, rape and atrocities, which cause the blood to run cold ! It is in cumbent upon them, in view of these calamities and catastrophes, to wear black and to observe mourning everywhere and not to leave the mourning places until they have avenged their brothers, taken revenge on their common enemies, restored what they have lost in their countries, regained the honour of their religion and hoisted the honourable standard on their heads. Take warning, Oh breth.en ! May God guide you to the right path, and wake up from the slumber of contempt, help one another in restoring your honour, use your endeavours in uniting against the enemies of God’s religion. Oh brethren, do not cause your Prophet to blush with shame before other nations but cause him to be delighted at your good acts, and to feel honoured by your laudable endeavours. Help each otber, Ob brethren, and unite in assisting each other, so that you may not feel powerless, because a contemptible life is more bitter than the wild gourd and a miserable life is an everlasting death. Should you, Oh brethren take no warning from the mischiefs and changes (which have taken place) and Irom what befell Islam in the Balkans, &amp;c.; then woe on Islam and on you, and we snould lament for the fate of Islam and of its adherents.

You should inform United States Government that the Turkish notification does not come with good grace just after the Germans have boasted of firing at the open port of Yarmouth and the Turkish fleet under German officers, without even a declaration of war or any warning, bombarded open towns in the Black Sea and burnt at least one British merchant vessel. l . . . , . That we have not so far fired upon any open town, and it is not our habit to do so unless we are attacking an armed force of the enemy, and should any massacre of Christians or killing of British subjects in cold blood take place, we shall hold any individual Turkish or other officer who orders it responsible. You should ask United States Government if they will inform their consul-general of all these considerations in order that he may be able to point them out to the Turkish authorities.

Where are the rich men? /here ar© those who, when they rode, hundreds of slaves and boxes of gold and silver followed them? here are those whose houses were open to hundreds of guests arid to hundreds of poor? All of them have passed away with the aggressive hands of the enemies of God. They have misled us in our religion; they have effaced the religious,sciences and replaced them by unbelief. They undertook to spoil the character of our children, young men and women, and have done their beat to suppress the book of God amongst ua. They have mined our mosques and c i ^d some of them into churches# They have damaged the small places of worship, seised the pious endowments (, vca r s) of osiers, and robbed tneir revonaes. They have also tampered with the benevolent institutions of oaloms end have abolished the ohsmedan Law,a Law, replacing it by their unjust and erroneous regula tions.

And where are the schools for the sublime Coran which existed in every village and every desert? In Tunis and its dependencies and in Algiers 9®, learned the Coran by heart, and there is not now the eighth of one. In most of these places this matter has been effaced and you hardly find some one who knows how to read well the preface of the Coran. You find no one to whom you can apply on a religious question. All that has been done by those unjust hands of the enemies of Cod, of His prophet, of our religion and of humanity. They have deceived us in our honour, in ourselves; they have treated us arbitrarily and deprived ua of every civil right which the other nations enjoy. The Jews in our comitry have their liberty and enjoy ell rights, and you are ore unfortunate than a *!.ranker, having no ri Lt whatever, fe lost oar standing so that they treat and respect their dogs more than us, and if they want to abuse a dog they call him by our name * They took from ua every moral force so that our heroes fee] themselves miserable even before a bad woman of the enemies of bod* Every one of them is a king in your Moslem country, proud, unjust and fears no punishment.

Where are your great and clever men whowho were feared and respected and before whom the nerves trembled and who protected the country and the Moslem nation against their enemies, and who could not stand injustice and preferred death with honour to any insult even to the smallest of their followers? Yea, they existed, but they passed away covered with the blood in the defence of their religion, their countrios, their families and their descendants; wrapped up in coffins of glory and nobleness of character, and before handing over their swords, they handed their innocent and noble souls to their Creator ho is the Just Judge; and all that with the hands of the unjust and usurpator enemies of Cod# Oh*# Moslem soldiers, that is the way they fought us, usurped our country, deceived us in connexion with our religion and our properties and our families.

(November 6, 7'40 p.m.) ACTING British consul-general at Smyrna reports as follows :— British, French, and Russian subjects were prevented from leaving at the time of his own departure. If the United States Ambassador could obtain permission for them to leave, United States man-of-war “ Tennessee,” now at Mitylene, could protect embarkation from Youflolah or Scala Nova on to vessel sent for the purpose. As regards protection of Europeans there, it might be feasible for ship of war mentioned to anchor on inner (Smyrna) side long island despite probable protest of Turkish Government. If United States consul-general at Smyrna were supplied with rockets, he and the man-of-war would thus be able always to communicate in case of local trouble. n i t j • Ship mentioned could [? keep] 200 sailors on the shore near Voulioiah, and it is most unlikely that Turkish Government would prevent them proceeding to Smyrna to save Europeans during disturbances. Governor-General gave acting consul-general personal assurance that he would do his utmost to protect Europeans. E1104-«88J t qUQMVS.MILITARY.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla (repeated to London Foreign Office). I have received the following telegram No. 122 from His Majesty s Consul at Basrah:— . “ His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah informs me that Vali of Basrah yesterday sent a message to H. M. S. “ Espiegle ”, which is stil in Karun to leave within 24 hours. Commander of “ Espiegle replied that he was there under orders. Both Commander and Consul telegraphed on several d a y 9 stating that protest was being raised by Turks, but no reply was received by either of them. “ In a written communication received by me last night from Vali, e stated that he would carry out such instructions as he should receive trom Ottoman Government if the ‘two gunboats now in Shatt-el-Arab Aid not leave within 24 hours. It had been pointed out to him by me that the previous communication received from him did not define attitude ol Turkey with regard to British ships^of-war this side of Fao at the time regula tions came into effect.” — Telegram P., dated Pera, the 10th (received 11th) October 1914. From—His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. A reference is invited to Foreign Office telegram No. 644. In view of the question of British war-ships at Mohammerah and in the Shatt-el-Arab having been referred to the legal advisers here, who it is likely will make out a case in support of Turkey's contention, I should like to be very clear of my grounds in any discussion which may arise as to the rights of our men-of-war to be there. I gather from Foreign Office telegram No. 644, that no British war-vessels are at present in the Shatt-el-Arab within limits of Turkish territorial waters, as interpreted by us, that is to say within three m jJ e9 pf the Turkish coast. But from the Consul’s reports it would appear that'Odin” and “Espiegle” and the “Lawrence*’and the “Dalhousie” have, at different times during the last few weeks, been lying in the Shatt-el-Arab in spite of Turkey’s protests, and are still there {vide my telegram which immediately preceded this one). In justification of this action, apart from any other legal considerations, the argument of retaliation on account of the hospitality afforded by Turkey to the two German Cruisers, viz., the “ Goeben ” and “ Breslau,” is, I conclude from Foreign Office telegram No. 587, one which has carried weight with you to some degree in despatching British men-of-war to these waters. The stationing of a British ship at Mohammerah in Persian waters is another matter, which primarily concerns Persia. I should like to be informed of the exact grounds on which we base our claim for British war-ships to pass through the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab when Great Britain is at war. Were this matter to cause a rupture with Turkey, which is possible owing to the division of authority here, I should like to be satisfied that we had clear legal justification for our position and an unanswerable case before the world as we should be incurring grave responsibility. Great Britain has so strong a case based on Turkish breaches of neutrality, violation of treaties, &amp;c., that it would be a pity to choose ground which is not absolutely tenable—if it is such—except sound reasons of policy be involved, especially since the internment of two British men-of-war might be the imme diate result. This telegram has been addressed to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and is repeated to His Excellency the Viceroy at Simla. jlz Telegram P., dated (and received) the 11th October 1914. From—The Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. Information from a trustworthy source has been received by me to the effect that Turkey is preparing to despatch troops to the Yemen frontier, with the object of acting against our Protectorate, and has requested the co-opera tion of the tribes who are immediately under her influence. This news is believed to be authentic. I do not know the attitude of Imam, but am trying to sound him through the Abdali Sultan, who is doing his utmost to further our interests and to procure reliable information. It will be expedient to provide the latter, on payment, with the arms and ammunition for which he has applied. Addressed to the Bombay Government ; repeated to the Secretary of State for India and to the Foreign and Political Department at Simla. -2,3 Telegram P., No. 1207, dated (and received) the 11th October 1914. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. On the 9th October, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mahommerah telegraphed to me. Firstly, he urges the importance of retaining our men- of-war up the river to protect British interests. He expresses (?) this view as the result of an interview with the Shaikh who evinced much agitation at the turn which events were taking. Secondly, he reports an interview with Syad Talib at the instance of the Shaikh, who represented Talib as being prepared to fall in with our views in the event of a rupture with Turkey. At the meeting, no definite proposal was made by Talib, who stated that Turkey was bent on war and that he could render assistance before, but not after, the out break of hostilities. Talib wished to have an interview with me. His Majesty’s Consul doubts the advisability of coming to a definite settlement with man of this calibre.The Eussian Consul-General, on the other hand, informs me that a Eussian merchant, who has lately come from Basrah, tells him that the Eussian Consul (P) there is of opinion that Turkey does not desire war and that this is the general belief in Basrah, where the ^ bazar rumours are all of the victories of the Allies. Government of India telegram, No. S. 875, dated the 9th October 1914, conveys a similar impression. Prom these repeated overtures, it is somewhat difficult to help coming to the conclusion that some of our sympathisers at the head of Gulf are, perhaps, slightly more disappointed (at ?) hopeful turn things are taking and are loth to°miss the opportunity of fishing in troubled waters. Presuming that our obiect is really to avert war with Turkey, if this is possible, I would urge that proposed expedition be abandoned, Grand Vizier’s instructions to Vali be given wide publicity and, after a reasonable interval of say 14 days, if events do not take any untoward turn, withdraw His Majesty s Ships and “ Espiegle ”, as we have saved our face, from vicinity of river and, with occasional visits, satisfy ourselves that our rights to use the water-way to Mohammerah is maintained. As regards Talib, I intend to send him a reply through the Shaikh, to the effect that for the moment I do not see any object in the proposed interview. I suggest adding to the communication, in order to avoid giving offence, that the situation at Constantinople is not as grave as it is said in Basrah to be, inform Talib of the latest orders which have been given to the Vah and say that Great Britain, whose sincere wish it is to avoid a breach of her traditional friendship with Turkey, has by no means given up all hope of succeeding in maintaining peace.

From—M ajor S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, ip 0 The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to report that, as foreshadowed in my telgram No. 1138, dated 24th September 1914, to your address, I proceeded in the 11.1. M. S. “Lawrence” from Bushire on the evening of the 26th September and arrived at Kuwait the next day. Before paying the usual visit ^o Shaikh Sir Mubarak-us-Subah, I had the advantage of a long talk with Colonel Grey, Political Agent at Kuwait, to whom I communicated the substance of your telegram No. 795 S., dated 23rd September 1914, to my address, m which you did me the honour to inform me of the rumours that had reached Cairo to^ the effect that the Amir of Nejd had entirely thrown in his lot with the Turks and was either contemplating, or had arrranged, the despatch of forces from Nejd into Syria to assist the Turks. 2. Colonel Grey bases his opinions largely on personal impressions formed at his interview with Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud at the time of the luikish nego tiations, and, secondly, on constant conversations on the subject with Shaikh Mubarak, who, however, he considers, is inclined to exaggerate the personal influence that Sir Mubarak imagines he exercises over the policy pursued by Bin Sand. 3. Colonel Grey refuses consistently to believe that Bin Saud has become a pro-Turk and treated as impossible the plans with which the latter was credited of marching bis Nejdis across the desert into Syiia. He has been unable to learn that the Turks have been aide to send to Nejd either the officers or soldiers or artillery, which rumour persisted in despatching to Nejd or A1 Alisa. He informed me that Abdul Aziz-bin-Salim-bin-Badar, Shaikh Mubarak’s well-known Agent at Basrah, was appioached by the Turkish authorities to know what would be the attitude of Shaikh Sir Mubarak if the Turks vent to war with England. Abdul Aziz replied that he did not know. He was asked to find out. lie refused to do this, but said that he would report the conversation. Colonel Grey had also learnt that, the day before my arrival at Kuwait, a messenger with secret despatches for Bin Saud had arrived in Kuwait, and he was, at the time of my visit, engaged in making further enquiries about him. 4 . The Political Agent and I then called on Shaikh Sir Mubarak, by whom we were received with the Shaikh’s invariable friendliness and hospital ity. I lost no time in taking Shaikh Sir Mubarak into my full confidence. The Shaikh scouted the notion of there being the smallest truth in the extra vagant rumours that had come from Cairo and fully endorsed a suggestion that I hazarded that, if Bin Saud actually did move his troops to Syria, the t first persons to regret such an invasion would be the Turks themselves for * Bin Sand’s wild Bedouins and Nejdis would, if they could be kept together | a t all, merely loot everything that came in their way. The Shaikh then sent for his Secretary who han ded to Colonel Grey the precis of a letter recently written by Sir Mubarak to Bin Saud. This said that Europe was greatly disturbed* that the Allies were getting the upper hand and that the Turkish Government was in great trepidation. Shaikh Mubarak further said that he had warned Bin Saud on no account to receive Turkish officers or troops, that he himself and all that was his were on the side of the English and that he had better follow the same policy, as both he and Bin Saud stood to gain something in this w r ay in the general confusion 5 . The conversation then turned on the emissary who had passed through Kuwait the previous day. Mubarak said quite frankly that the man had been his guest, named him as Yar Ullah ad Dakhil, said that he was a well-kown cnaraeter and mischief-maker, who had formerly been the go-between between \ the Turks and Bin Rashid and commented on the folly of the Turks in choos- ino- as emissary to Bin Saud, a man who had already been on friendly terms with Bin Sand’s ancestral enemy.6. Having gleaned all possible information at Kuwait, I left the same evening and arrived at Bahrain the morning of the 29th Septemher. Shaikh Isa soon sailed off to meet me, and, after the usual preliminary courtesies and when the Political Agent had joined us, I asked the Shaikh to accompany us to the aft-cahin for a private interview at which we three only were present. Shaikh Isa said that Bin Saud was quietly at Riadh, that he had not heard of his making any hostile moves in any direction, that he was on fairly good terms with the Turks but wanted and expected better conditions and more honour from them, when he would come down to A1 Ahsa, where he was expected shortly. Asked if he had heard news of any foravs or raids in prepartion, he replied that Bin Saud was not in strength sufficient to pursue a very active policy, that he was afraid of the Araif who were with the Sbariff of Mecca. I expressed surprise at this, but he assured me that it was the case and likened Bin Saud to a bird who had lately been badly harassed and frightened (presumably by his alarm of the threat of the Turks to move against him) but had got over its troubles, settled down in peace for the moment and praised God. 1 just mentioned Syria without further detail and Shaikh Isa said that it was impossible. All his accounts were that Bin Saud was expected shortly at Al Ahsa. Later on Yusuf Kanoo, who personifies Bahrain rumour, told me the same thing. The Political Agent also had no other information. 7. I remain of the opinion that I was, before I started on my travels, that the Cairo rumours are impossible and probably originated with the Turkish authorities in those parts who are using them, to impress people with the notion that, if the Turks are attacked, Arabia will rise to defend Constanti nople. Nothing seems less probable. a/- No. Cf. 282, dated Bushire, the 1 st October 1911 (Confidential). From— Major S. G.

From—Enver Pasha, To—The Wali of Basrah. \ There will come to you either by land or sea 32 (or 42) officers and among them German officers. If they reach you, help them. They will go to the Baluch and India and to Afghanistan and Mesopotamia for the awakening of religion. Dated the 26th July 1914. From—Enver Pasha, To—The Commandant of Basrah, There is to-day talk of war among the nations. We have news from our Ambassadors. Take well hold of your affairs secretly.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. The British Consul at Mohammerah has sent me the following telegram, No. 143, dated the 13th instant:— “The British Consul at Basrah received a letter last night from the Vali in which he states that, on the 11th October, the Porte had intimated to the British Embassy at Constantinople that British gunboats {sic) at Mohammerah must leave and pass through the Shatt-el-Arab and reach the open sea within 8 days: failing compliance they will be interned until the end of the war. The Vali, accordingly, says that the “ Espiegle ” may leave within 8 days reckoning from the 11th of October and any attempt on her part to leave the Shatt-el-Arab after the expiration of the given period will be stopped by force of arms.5 * ) n it 8 , 311 in fl ier Apparently the Turks do not demand that the “ Espiegle *' should disarm so long as she remains at Mohammerah. Personally, I think, from a local point of view, the departure of our ship very undesirable as it would create a bad impression here and also have the effect of encouraging the Yali to fresh efforts. —*3— Telegram P., No. 1223, dated the 13th (received 14th) October 1914, From— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, Pin Saud.

Prom a secret source I learn that the Turks have informed the Shaikh of Mohammerah that, until further orders, “ Mozafferi ” rights of passage in Shatt-el-Arab will be refused by them. 1 understand that this prohibition is a breach of Article 2 of the Articles of the Erzeroum Agreement of 1847 and quite unjustifiable in regard to neutral ships, even allowing (which is difficult) that ‘*Mozafferi ,, Persian Customs Steamer, can be classed as a ship of war, it appears to me advisable that a strong protest should be made to Turkey.

Enclosure 2 in No. 1. 'Note, verbale communicated to Sublime Porte. ? \ HIS Britannic Majesty’s Embassy lias the honour to acknowledge receipt of the circular note verbale of the 1 st instant, in which the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs enunciates certain principles in accordance with which the Imperial Ottoman Government propose to define the limits of their territorial w r aters for military purposes. His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy will take the earliest opportunity of forwarding a copy of this communication to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. As, however, much time must elapse in the present state of affairs before it can receive the comments of His Majesty’s Government on the subject, the Embassy has the honour to remind the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the contents of its notice of the 9th November, 1911, and to state that it is unaware of any change in the views of His Britannic Majesty’s Government since that date. With reference to the special rules laid down in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , and 7, His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, pending the receipt of instructions from His Majesty’s Government, must formulate express reservations as to the jurisdiction claimed by the Imperial Government in any portion of the sea outside the commonly recognised 3-mile limit. The Imperial Ministry will doubtless recognise the special importance of those reserves at the present time in connection with the waters adjoining the Mediterranean entrance to the Dardanelles Straits and the portion of the Persian GuH immediately outside the Shatt-el-Arab. His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy is convinced that the Imperial Government will recognise the advisability of avoiding any action in waters outside the commonly recognised 3 -mile limit which might lead to regrettable international incidents. Before concluding its present note, His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy cannot refrain from expressing its regret at the minatory language used m the circular note under reply in regard to the public vessels of a friendly State. On a previous recent occasion His Biitannic Majesty s Embassy refrained from replying to a communication m which similar language was used, out of deference for the expressed wish of the head of the Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is the more to be regretted that similar language has been used in the present circular note.

From—The Resident at Aden, To—The Bombay Government (repeated to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India and to Secretary, Foreign and Political Department). I have received the following letter, dated 22nd September, from our paid informant from Hodeida :— Begins. Imam and the Idrisi have both received communications from Constantinople urging them to discontinue fighting with one another. Districts are being toured by Governor-General of Yemen in order to raise a national army and he has been discussing matters with the Imam at Al-Kafla. Our informant is of opinion that present times are full of surprises. Abolition of Capitulations has been proclaimed in Hodeida. Export of gold has been prohibited. Habl, Meidi and Ljezan have been blockaded. It is also mentioned by our informant that two modern Turkish cruisers (sic ?) which arrived at Hodeida in Ramazan have been recalled to Constantinople. Turkish Government have also withheld a moiety of the salary of officials during the continuance of war. Letter ends. If the above-mentioned news in regard to the Idrisi and Imam be true, Turks have forestalled us and rendered the programme which was outlined in mv telegram, dated the 11 th instant, somewhat difficult, though not impossible. I would request, therefore, that definite action be taken, firstly as regards rendeiing of assistance to Imam in the manufacture of gunpowder, and secondly, as regards the bestowal of decorations on our two influential protected chiefs. These preliminary measures are very important and are, indeed, prior to the contingency of war, the only legitimate means we have of proving to the Arabs our inclination towards them. Sultan of Lahej has, it must be remem bered, a great deal of influence with the Imam. 4; Telegram P., No. 116, dated (and received) the 30th September 1914.

Karachi Brigade, asked for assistance regarding enquiries about certain Turks from the Persian Gulf who bad been detained in Karachi. The result of mv enquiries are summarised below and have been communicated from time to time to the local officers concerned. , A party of nine European Turks appear to have collected in Maskat and shortly after the outbreak of war to have left in different directions some returning to Basrah and others proceeding to India. One portion of this nar'v was headed by Colonel Nuri of the Turkish army from Basrah and consisteH of (2) Abdul Wahib, (3) Sahib, and (4) Mehdi; with the exception of Abdul Wahib who is now probably in Kabul, all these persons returned to Basrah Ismail Bey and Mohammad Puad are still in Maskat (vide list below) Of this party Mohammad Fuad, Abdul Wahib and Mohammad Amin Bev hare all at one time or another been employed in Kabul. Whether or not these persons constitute an organised mission is to some extent a question of coniec- i’nu' i 18 h ,°'! eVP Z S ?r! hln - tan S ible against Mohammad Amin Bey Abdul Majid and Tewfik Shukri. • ’ The^rticulam at present known regarding each of the Turks is as ( 1 ) Mohammad Fuad is an instructor of the Nizam Jalali at Maskat Tim man is believed to have formerly been an instructor of the Amir’s army stilUhere. ^ ^ m Maska * durins the earl y P art of this year and is ( 2 ) Ismail Bey. This man is a guest of the Sultan of Maskat arul hi. father is a doctor in Baghdad. He arrived from Constantinople on the 20th July and is still present in Maskat. 1 Jbdul TFahtb arrived in Maskat on the 29th July from Basrah ho „ on three months’leave from Kabul, where he is an instructor fn h ’ ll^bib a rte nl v 6 ' n H n 18a ^ e {! h ? WOf P olonel Sami, late instructor of , ' e , iiai'd'Ci College, Kabul, who is at present residing in Peshawar (v.i, i MahmudSami was expeiled from Kabul in the conspiracy case of December 1913. Abdul Wahib arrived in Karachi on the 8 th August m,l ] A ft r Peshawar on the 12 th August, and in the absence of any inforLat on to th r contrary is presumably in Kabul at present. 7 nation the w i Colonel Nuri arrived in Maskat on the 29th Julv with ann i onlthe* IStfa 1 August.' He was a ^ Sultan. He returned to Basrah (3) and (^ ^ ^ iD Maskat 0n the 29th ^7- Accompanied Colonel NuH’fpamf ^ 4 ^ Ma3tat ° n the 29th aDd is of (7) Abdul Majid Kamil. ( 8 ) Tewfik Shukri. fThey have visited Bombay together and Tewfik Shukri 'was sent to Bhopal and Delhi; they are now desirous of returning to Egypt. Abdul Majid Kamil was formerly a Captain in the Egyptian Army and says be served with the Camel Corps, and resigned as he was unable to get some leave he required. Tewfik Shukri figures as the agent of Abdul Majid to sell his books. I have examined a considerable number of books and correspond ence found in their possession. A pamphlet found among Abdul Majid’s papers called “Eazaih-al-Soudan’ , “The Eevelation of the Soudan” or “ the experiences of Sheikh Abdul Aziz Chawash”, compiled and published by Abdul Majid Kamil, proved to be an account of the celebrated Denshaw’s case and of a highly anti-British and revolutionary character, this pamphlet was given to me by Captain Gribbon. These two men are in prison in Karachi. (9) Mohammad jimin Bey ihn Jalal-ud-din arrived in Maskat on the 22nd July and stayed as a guest of the Sultan. He left Maskat on the 15th. September and was detained as a suspect by the military authorities in Karachi. I was asked to interview him. He made statements with regard to a Pan-Islamic movement engineered by Germany and Turkey in the Persian Gulf, and also referred to the mission of Germans in disguise, and Turks to the courts of Tehran and Kabul. As it was impossible from the knowledge at our disposal to correctly appraise the information given concerning local events in the Persian Gulf, Mohammad Amin Bey was sent to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who would be in a position to know what credence, if any, was to be placed on his statements. The impression, the interview 1 have had with him left, was that he together with the following were emissaries in a Pan-Islamic movement— (1) Abdul Wahib Turk who left for Peshawar. (2) Abdul Majid Kamil in prison in Karachi. (3) Tewfik Shukri in prison in Karachi. (4) Mohammad Euad, Turkish Instructor in Maskat. Mohammad Amin Bey lay particular stress on the German and Turkish mission proceeding overland to Tehran and Kabul. And when talking continually referred to a note-book in which he professed to have copies of translations of cipher messages received by various Turkish officials. Considering the difficulties such a mission as described would have in crossing Persia and Afghanistan, it seemed most probable that, if there was any propaganda at all on foot, it would be via British India to Kabul. Inspector Khan Sahib Ikhlas-ud-din at Maskat reported about the mission on the 29th August. These reports were submitted to Colonel Benn, C.I.E., and Major Murphy, Military Intelligence Officer in the Persian Gulf. I find on enquiry that in all probability Mohammad Amin Bey and Abdul Majid Kamil were the originators of the report that the German Turkish mission was proceed ing via Persia to Kabul, as my Inspector’s informant was in very close touch with both of these men during their stay in Maskat. Abdul Majid and his servant Tewfik Shukri have so far completed a tour in India, Karachi, Bombay, Bhopal and Delhi having been visited and they were on their way back to the Persian Gulf when detained in Karachi. The Resident in the Persian Gulf may possibly be able to prove these conjectures to be ill founded. In dealing with spies and emissaries, it is hardly possible to obtain evidence of any judicial value and the above con clusion is founded on the assumption of an alleged Pan-Islamic movement in India, Persia and Kabul either with or without German or Turkish support; it is possible that the whole thing is a creation of Mohammad Amin Bey and Abdul Majid. The fact that Abdul Majid Kamil had a copy of his own pamphlet “ Eazaih-al-Soudan ” is itself significant. The Resident in the Persian Gulf has been asked to return Mohammad Amin Bey to Karachi and on his arrival further enquiries will be made. 4. I have also interviewed two Arabs under orders of deportation as undesirables—(1) Ahmad Eaik ibn Usman, and (2) Pazal ibn Baktash fromt 6 p ' ‘ Acting under instructions that we will do so to her,* n ill Mesopotamia They apparently were stow-away and were disembarked on the arrival of the steamer in Karachi. I do not consider them in any way con nected with the Tu ks mentioned above. I hay? not been able to trace Azmir, their native place, but understand it to be in Irak. 5. The deportation of Turks to the Persian Gulf may possibly upset the political situation, for it is conceivable that deportees on arrival in the Gulf would gain considerable local sympathy by representing the fact of their deportation having been ordered without their country being at war with Great Britain. For many respects detention in an Indian prison is preferable to deportation, as it stops the propaganda entirely, and in the case of foreigners their absence is not likely to cause any notice as they are mostly travellers who move from place to place and are not in consequence missed. 6. I have offered to prevent the embarkation at the ports in the Persian Gulf of European foreigners, whose entry into British India has been prohibit ed by Government, in the same manner that Afghans are at present prevented from entering into Indian ports. The Commissioner in Sind, Mr. Lucas, approved of my action, as many benefits of the prohibition were lost when such undesirables once landed in Karachi. I am taking immediate steps to put this into effect. Copies forwarded to the following :— 1. The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province, Peshawar. 2.

Some little time ago I was informed by Mehdi Bey, Deputy for Kerbala, that he was being compelled by Turkish Government to use his influence with Mujtahids in Caucasia, Mesopotamia, India and Persia to promote Pan-Islamio propaganda of which he disapproved in reality. This was to be done by letters-of-marque. He offered to send through me letters in contrary sense so as to counteract his own propaganda. As he has not come forward since first occasion and he does not inspire much confidence, I have not pursued matter here. Vice-Consul at Kerbala might, however, be instructed by you to ascertain whether Mujtahids are being utilised for such propaganda and what their dispositions are. They should he discreetly influenced in our favour by Vice-Consul.

Constantinople, October 28, 1914. RUSSIAN Ambassador communicated to me last night a telegram from Russian consul at Mohammerah stating that Turks were menacing Sheikh with bombardment if he did not summon H.M.S. “ Espiegle ” to leave, and that Sheikh had left palace at Failieh and gone with his family to Ahwaz. I have not had confirmation of this myself, but I went this morning to Grand Vizier to warn him of consequences of such action if it was confirmed. His Highness said that it was not true, nor was it true that Turkish Government was laying mines in the Shatt-el-Arab, with regard to which I had made representations on the receipt of your telegram No. 698 of 23rd October. His Highness seemed more confident this morning, and ridiculed the idea of Turkey going to war with Triple Entente. In view of information which I have communicated to you, this must not of course be taken seriously, but it tends to show that decision is deferred for the moment. I told Grand Vizier that his assurances did not, unfortunately, carry much weight, as military party would act without consulting him when moment seemed to be opportune and when their preparations were complete. He indignantly repudiated this suggestion, and vehemently asserted in his old style that Turkey did not mean to break her neutrality. I casually mentioned Italy’s interests should Turkey take the field against Islamic [sic] Powers, and he said that Italy’s action was certainly point to be considered. I cannot help thinking with regard to this that something might be done. It is a point which must have occurred to Germany, who may possibly try to make some arrange ment to secure Italy’s interests. Italian Ambassador, who has been very friendly, but who naturally first considers Italian interests, has constantly betrayed great anxiety lest Turkey should become involved. His anxiety is of course entirely on Italy’s account. If Italy could make it clear to Turkey now that in this matter she was solid with Entente it would go far to preserve peace. If Egypt were endangered Italy’s position in Tripoli would be precarious. (Sent to India and Rome.) &amp; \t \/ [ 1002 - 1220] Ifi!CONFIDENTIAL ''N 1 ; * f 'j :h ■ ■ (i b w O : i O' i “Sr /Si?’ F.

I remarked that it was unfortunate that he had not got the support of the Minister of the Interior to which he did not reply. His Highness went on to say that his personal position was exceedingly difficult as it was being said that he was afraid of complications with England on account of his interests in Egypt and he com plained that we had made things more difficult for him by detaining Khedive here in the first instance when he was anxious to go. Khedive was a man incapable of running straight and had become, the focus of intrigue here. He spoke rather despondently at first but towards the end of the interview regained his usual confidence- assuring me that no incursions would be made into Egypt and that there was a great deal of fanfaronnade in all the talk {* gg CCUS-Xj * i v:/; r . •V’l ? v M'-i -a. tallc about Egypt.

Minister of Marine denied this absolutely and also declared that Turkey was not going to war. My French colleague then enquired what preparations in Syria meant and all the violent talk about Egypt, Minister of Marine replied that this was another matter. England was treating Egypt as if it be longed to her whereas it forms part of Ottoman Dominions. They wero Indifferent about India.

Third battalions are no doubt in existence as regards numbers of men, but require training before they can be incorporated with others.

The attitude, adopted by the Turkish Government in regard to the German warships “ Goeben ” and‘‘Breslau ”, has aroused great” misgivings n London and Paris and Petrograd. These ships were flying from French 1 ^ wh ltlS \ m ^* 0f '^ ar Mediterrane an and took refuge in the Dardanel- ies, where, by the rules of International Law and under Turkish Treaties they should have been laid up by the Turkish Government and their crews repat- of Wemyllour\oZ. 0f Wal '’ ” t0 leaVe f ° r the 0 P eu ^ at the ^ Instead of this, the ships were allowed to remain in shelter and to exercise v D ele nt rights on a trench ship, and then it was announced that they had BritisrA 0 dmlral b from U h key ’ who '' etained the German crews and dismissed the Bntisn Admiral horn his executive command of the Turkish fleet. and BriiSr W T • h ® , passase 0f the Darda nell e s was sown'with mines, w^re^LdiT un ln ,^ 10se waters °r coming through from the Black Sea whom 'Inrj?’ fi u , the prete , xt 1 that tlleIr cargoes were wanted for troops y was mobilizing, and then, that the presence of mines rendered it eni ^thT: S rt 0 nr 0Ceed ; WaS UOt un jus Xble tnCl^ both shinier a “ eutral . Sta te with the trade of Great Britain involved British ehmnina'in Z u ? Z beaVy l0S8&gt; but il P aral y sed movement of ail shipping in the Black Sea, amounting at the time to 60 or 70 vessels,since not only was it impossible to get through into the Mediterranean, but there was nothing to prevent the “ Goeben ” and “ Breslau ” passing into the Black Sea and destroying all the ships collected there. While the wireless telegraphy installations of Erench and British ships were dismantled by orders of the Turkish Government, a German merchant vessel, the “ Lily Rickmers ”, was allowed to retain and use her apparatus and was afterwards transferred to the Turkish Rag, a proceeding which the Turkish Government themselves admit to be wholly illegal. Another reason of grave disquietude has been unfriendly treatment by responsible Turkish officials in Baghdad and Mesopotamia of British subjects and the open incitement of the population by Turkish official circles against Great Britain and her allies. Notwithstanding all this provocation, His Majesty’s Government have not only intimated that, if Turkish are substituted for German crews on the “ Goeben ” and “ Breslau ” and if British merchant ships are not impeded and if Turkey will honourably carry out the duties of a neutral State, not only would all these hostile acts and illegalities be overlooked but that a solemn and written guarantee would be given that Great Britain will scrupulously respect and safeguard the integrity of the Turkish Empire: furthermore, assurances w r ere given that, at conclusion of peace, Great Britain would see that no conditions were laid down, which would impair that independence and integrity, and that economic conditions of a character favourable to Turkey would be obtained. Great Britain, the greatest Muhammatlan Power in the world and the faithful and consistent friend of Turkey, whom she has steadfastly helped to maintain her position in Europe and to recover the stability, shaken in the Balkan wars, would see with the greatest regret that Turkey had been decoyed into ranging herself on the side of England’s enemies and adopting an attitude as unjustified as it would be ungrateful, but it cannot be denied that the present situation shows that there is a chauvinistic element endeavouring to drive Turkey into war with England for the benefit of Germany and of Austria, the secular enemy of the Turkish State. Special Notice to be issued by the Political Resident on the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey. To the Arab Rulers and Shaikhs in the Persian Gulf and their subjects. By a series of acts, directed against the peaceful traders of Great Britain, the Turkish Government has involved itself in hostilities with the Great Government and with France and Russia. Since the Crimean War, when France and Great Britain voluntarily went to war to preserve the integrity of Turkey, it has been one of the supreme objects of the British Government to preserve inviolate the Ottoman Empire. Now, by their own act in foolishly intervening in the struggle between Germany’and all the other Powers, the present rulers of that Empire have prepared their own destruction and it appears impossible to hope that their Empire can any longer be preserved. It therefore behoves the independent Shaikhs of Arabia to consider their attitude towards this oppressor of Moslems, who calls himself their Protector, as if the Moslems needed a protector other than Allah. Of the attitude of the Shaikhs, who are near to Turkey and have seen and felt their oppression there is no doubt whatever. They have long been in oonosition to Turkey and have been endeavouring to obtain their freedom. Some have actually done so and the others are now in open rebellion against her. The Rulers and the Shaikhs of the Persian Gulf know well that Great Britain has never interfered with the religious observances of the Moslems nor shown hostility to them, but lias invariably laboured for the preservation of peace and good order and for friendly relations with all her neignbours. limes4 without number opportunities have presented themselves for the acquisition of fresh territory and any temptation of the kind has been resisted. Your relations with Great Britain are of long standing and I take the opportunity of assuring you that in this struggle we shall do our utmost to preserve for you your liberty and religion. No act of ours shall threaten either C* of these, which are dearer to humanity than life itself. Unfortunately, the arrogance and the folly of Turkey have involved the whole world in calamity and trouble. All that is required on your part is that you should preserve order and quiet in your dominions and will not allow the foolish among your subjects, who may not realise how long, by the benevolent protec tion of Great Britain, they have been preserved from the hand of the oppressor from doing anything to disturb the quiet of your dominions or to injure British interests. In tins way with a little patience you will emerge unseated from the troubles that now surround you and be stronger and freer than before. Do not allow the foolish people to be led away by foolish talk of “ jahad ”. This war has nothing to do with religion except that it is the interest of all religions to destroy the proud and overbearing and strengthen the quiet people who desire nothing but to preserve their independence and remain at peace. Jffer compliments.—In continuation of my previous letter, informing Your Excellency of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey, I am authorised by my Government to say that, in response to your loyal offers of co-operation, which are here again gratefully acknowledged, the High Government requests you to undertake the reduction of the Turkish posts in your territory of Umm Qasr, Safwan and Bubiyan and to co-operate with Shaikh Sir Khaz’al Khan of Mohammerah and su h Arab chiefs and notables as you can rely on, together with such distant co-operation as the Amir Abdul Aziz can afford in capturing Basrah from the Turks or, should such a task be beyond your powers, to make such arrangements, especially above Gurnah, with a view to preventing assistance reaching Basrah from Baghdad until such time as the British arrive and take over the city, It is hoped that it will l0 ”? before powerful assistance will reach you and two British ships will be in the river, before your forces arrive there. = t To Shaikh Sir Mobarak bin Subah, &amp;c., &amp;c. - l, UJ.

Q. Knox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. While we were astonished at the report receired in our town of Dibai from India regarding the hostility between the European Powers, we received an intimation from your Agent, Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, that war has broken out between Great Britain and Germany, and subsequently, we received your letter, dated the 22nd Ramazan (15th August) intimating that a state of war exists between Great Britain and Austria and also your communication of the 15th Ramazan (8th August 1914) announcing that war has occurred between Great Britain and Germany. Both ourselves and the inhabitants of our town have been disturbed by this serious catastrophe, which has proved a universal calamity and which has disturbed peace in every respect and ruined commerce. This catastrophe is a misfortune, the occurrence of which did not cross any one’s mind ; but there is no help for it (literally, “ we say what is said by those who are patient, viz., ‘verily we are from God and verily to Him shall we return’”). In order to evince our well-wishes and sense of honour and to return thanks for the good (done to us), it is incumbent upon us to assist the exalted and Imperial British Government, as it has always ensured comfort for us, and our town, enterprise and business which has gained us our livelihood. We have undoubtedly considered onrselves to be under many obligations to it in every respect and we have not repaid it in any way as we are not in a position to do so owing to our inability, which is not hidden from it. In this catas trophe, whose parallel we have not heard since the times of our forefathers and ancestors, we have been meditating most anxiously to get an opportunity of doing such good services as may gain us merit in its august presence ; but we find ourselves unable in every way. However, we pray to God, the Most High, to help it and to grant it victory over its enemies who are opposing it with aggression. By the grace of God, it will be the aggressor who will suffer a downfall. Please never discontinue from us the news of your well-being and your good reports. Phis is what had to be stated and may you remain preserved. Greetings. A5 Telegram P., No. 1148, dated the 26th (received 27th) September 1914.
