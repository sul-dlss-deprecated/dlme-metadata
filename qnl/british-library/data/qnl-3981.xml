After reviewing the numerous solutions which have been suggested in the past, my Government have instructed me to state that they favour one of two methods of dealing with this question, to the settlement of which they attach the utmost / importance, in the interest of the relations between this country and Kuwait and of their own relations with the Govern ment of Saudi Arabia. These methods are the following (a) To return to the proposal nade by Kis Majesty | King Abdul Aziz himself in the first instance that the | commissioners representing each of the parties should meet and endeavour to work out a compromise, on the understanding that the ? task of the commissioners would be to frame recommendations for consideration by the higher authorities. (b) To explore the possibility of an agreement on one particular basis, which has been suggested in the past, namely that t|ie trade across the frontier should be controlled at one or more customs posts on the territory of His Majesty the King, | to which all trade whould be directed. The object of this letter is to indicate in general terms the views of my Government. I suggest that we should take an early opportunity of discussing the matter orally and consider together how far it may be possible to overcome any difficulties which have at an earlier period delayed progress towards a solution on one or other of those bases.

I do not exactly see, however, what pressure the delegates can bring to bear on members of the Shaikh*s family (paragraph 2 of your telegram No.90), and in any case it is up to the Shaikh to counteract the delegates* influence with his own family in whatever way he thinks fit. 3.

(b) Confidential letter No. R-4/1994 dated 4.4. 1935 from H.E. the Shaikh to myself. 2. For your information, after the Shaikh received my letter (a) above, he sent round his Secretary, K.B. Mulla Salih, the same evening to see me. The latter appeared upset and much worried at what he called his master’s t, difficult M attitude. The Shaikh he said had sent for him on receipt of my letter and had told him to go and tell me that he (the shaikh) Tran ted to send his Kuwait delegates to Bahrain to meet the Saudi delegates there, as according to him (the Shaikh)^ would save time, trouble and expense. 3. K.B. Mulla Salih said that he had expostulated with the Shaikh and told him that Bin Saud and His Majesty’s Government would take such a suggsstion very unkindly indeed but that the ShaikhShaikh, who had bean seedy and very nervy of late, would not listen to him. Having delivered the message Mulla Salih advised me strongly to go to tackle his master the next day. This I did. 4. At my interview (on 4th April) the Shaikh came to the point at once and said he wanted to send tbs Kuwait delegates to Bahrain and not receive the Saudi delegates in Kuwait - I expressed very great surprise at his attitude and told him bluntly that I would be no party to the suggestion at all, and would refuse to telegraph such a foolish proposal to Jedda or to yourself - I then started a regular wordy fight with him, which resulted in his finally agreeing to write to me and say that he would receive the Commission at once, but that he desired that only the two senior members should come. n The discussions ”, he said, 'could be carried through better if few men talked '. Seeing that he was adamant, I agreed to wire Jedda the gist of the Shaikh’s talk with me, (see my telegram No.88). The same evening the Shaikh sent me his letter (enclosed). 5. That the Shaikh is all nerves and unwell these days may be instanced by the fact that when I asked why he did not want all the Saudi delegates to come (we believed them to be four), he shouted out 'Why should I put up and feed them and their retainers - I have no money these days, I am on the verge of ruin, and all owing to your Government - put them up yourself rather heatedly that in the New Agency'. I replied^ I certainly would, if he wished to be stingy. He immediately changed his tone and replied rather pathetically 'forgive me my friend, but I am sick in heart and mind and the world seems wrong these days. I will do my best, but I feel absolutely certain that Bin Saud has already told his delegates not to agree to the Customs posts and manifest system, which is the only system X can possibly agree to have, and which I have already told your government as muchAt** 20 as much by formal letter - rfhy then should I welcome men who are going to do nothing, nay, are going to try and bring about my ruin*. Jo ♦ 6. The above is sent to give you an idea of how the wind is blowing here, but as I said in roy telegram No. 90, I think, the real reason(apart from poor health), why the Shaikh is difficult, is because he is terrified of underhand methods being used against him by the delegates and in particular of a family intrigue being started through Shaikh Abdulla as Salim and arrived with many mutilations -• X polled on the shaikh at 4.30 P.M. on 9th April in his Gamp at BIYAN (situate some 7 miles from Kuwait). me that his wife the Lady Ahmad was getting on well after her recent unpleasant operation, he showed me a telegram which he had just received from Philby from Riath: This was to the Philby.^ ^0 news G f whose coming arrival was conveyed to the Shaikh on 3rd April.

His Majesty’s Government agree that there can be no question introducing either oil or Neutral Zone into Blockade discussions.

POLITICAL AOANCY, KUWAIT. The 13th April 1935. ^ Philby 1 &amp; &amp; a viait to Auv/ait 0 My hear ?o w l©» As I warned you by telegram recently, Philby with Mrs. Philby arrived on the afternoon of the 10th and put up with us in the agency - Longrigg arrived from Basra earlier in the day and is staying with me also. 2 ' Philby early disclaimed any intention of desiring to mix himself up with the coming Blockade Qojifei*©nee, and assured me that he was en route to the United Kingdom via IBa^ and would do the whole journey by car. Longrigg also assured me that his arrival on the same day with Philby was a coincid«ice only (this remains to be seen). 3. To make matters sure and before actually receiving your telegraphic instructions on the subject, I told both Philby and Longrigg that whether or not they had any intention of discussing oil and the Neutral Zone with the Shaikh, they were not at liberty to do so without H.M. Qovemment’s prior sanction. Philby showed annoyance and asked if I could give this in writing. Lengrigg accepted the situation. 4. Both called on the Shaikh separately,yesterday (11.4.35), I having previously warned the shaikh by note 'he Hon’ble Lieut-Colonel, T.C.Fowle,C.B.B., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that2 that I had r®quet,t©d both my gueats not to discuss 'oil'’ with him, and had received a quick reply expressing his gratitude* 5. his interview fcith the ohaikh, Ihilby openly and at once declared that he had no business to transact, lie when Xongrigg stated that he represented an 'International Oil Group', and that he had been sent down from Haifa to get into touch with him, the Shaikh, with a view to obtain ing exploratory rights in the Neutral Zone, but that as the Political ^gent had told him to obtain H.M*Government*s 'blessing' before he could proceed further he would not discuss matters then, but hoped to return later* (All this I had from the Shaikh today 12*4*35). 6* In course of a long private talk with Philby I learned that he (Philby) had (a) Had been the princi~pal negoti tor with the Standard Oil of California on behalf of Bin Baud and was omj entirely with the lat u oil questions. (b) That the situation war ctually as conveyed in India Office Confidential ^ote P.Z.2325/35 of 2nd week* s April 1935 to you - and me by this^air mail from London, i.e* that the Standard Oil of California had definitely and finally been given the prior right by Bin Saud to a concession for his half of the Neutral Zone, and in consequence held the whip hand over all comers • (c) That he, Philby, saw no reason at all why the Shaikh should not either give a concession for his half, to the same company or get a British concern to go half shares with the ^unericon company - but that no doubt His Majesty’s Government would 'block' the first suggestion 'with their well known policy: 3 &amp; ^ policy of interfering with the freedcan of i^reb States in the Grulf'* (his words). 7. 7. Longrigg also in a private talk admitted (1) that he was working for the anglish (A.P.O.C) and the French groups of the I.F.C., and that others comprising the I.P#Q. (Americans and Dutch) might later come in also. His company was not as yet formed however. (2) that the ultimate aim of his principals was to go half shares in the Neutral ^one, with the Standard Oil of California and that the latter had approached them to this effect in London already. That even if His Majesty’s Government did not like it she would have to agree sometime or otner as the Standard Oil clearly had the 'whip hand' now and it were better to amalgamate than to declare the Neutral Zone 'steralized'• (3) that he suspected Holmes of having got a promise long ago out of the Shaikh to reserve Kuwait*i half share in the Neutral Zone to himself, but in view of Holmes detached attitude (he had a long talk with him) he thought possibly that he was mistaken. 8. I told you in my wire sent you yesterday (lltnm April 1933) that both Philby and Longrigg would leave Kuwait today. The former, however, has gone down with high fever, diagnosed as 'Malar im n and cannot move,while Longrigg has ajfced to be allowed to stop a day or two longer (no doubt to watch Philby)• Longrigg this morning (12.4.1935) told me that he had orders to go down to the Trucial Coast especially to Abu Dhabi on behalf of his principals but I rode him off and told him he could not do thid till he had got the approval of His Majesty's Government through you - I hopeir^Uhr ~TJ, '•SmmtB&amp;BBSSk'’ 4 : - it © I hope I di4 right* 1^. Longrigg denied all knowledge of 'Traders* in answer to a direct question from me last ni^it, as to whether he was really working for them. He even said he had never heard of such a company. (This makes me suspicious) • XI, In private Philby, Longrigg and Holmes each abused the other roundly and with venom. (Verb bap)* Yours sincerely,• a- 'mjilr mif i.— StSCRST . D.O.No. 106/C. POLITICAL ^Gii^'GY, KUWAIT* The 13th April 1935. 2 1 1 In continuation of my Secret D.O. No. 104 dated 12th April 1935 re Ogilvie Forbes and Stafford’s visit here, 2. It will, Ithink, be of interest to you and His Majesty’s Government to learn what Philby has had to say on the subject of both Kuwait Nejd omuggling . and the probable line the Saudi delegates will take in their coming Blockade discussions. 3. You will thiis have the point of view of those English men in Bagdad who think that IRa has a grievance against Kuwait, as well as the ideas and views of a first j rate Baudi Champion. v The latter, as you will see, is even more emphatic than his northern confreres ,that Kuwait has no right* at all and should cease to exist. 4. Philby’s views on“smuggling” into Nejd from Kuwait were given with candour and frankness, but clearly showed that he had got them from prejudiced sources, and that he had only studied the question superficially (he made several statements which were untrue). He admitted dear Fowle, r tJ' \ 1 u.' Fhe Hon’ble Lieut-Colonel T.C. Fowle, C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, thatthf t what he aeid reflected the ideas of the King. 5. ioaomother things Philby assured me - inte (a) That smuggling wifch Hejd continued to be very henry. (b) That in spite of this / Bin Sciud f s biocide was slowly but surely bringing Kuwait to her knees and that Bin Saud knew this perfectly well. (c) Thet Bin Saud had no personal grudge a^iinst Kuwait, but believed, like himself (Philby), that Kuwait had no ri$it at all to exist as an independent State. (d) That as her population were all Nejdi^ by origin, they naturally were the subjects of Saudiyeh and would always be so considered by the King. (e) That the people of Kuwait one and all wanted Bin Baud to rule over them and not Ibn Subah. (f) That therefore it was ethically wrong that a single family like Ibn Subah should have it in their power to hold the best port in Arabia ,and deny it to its rightful lord, just because His Majesty’s Government chose to give support to that family - He for one thought His Majesty’s Government was putting themselves terribly in the wrong in this matter, and opined that if she withdrew her protection the people of Kuwait would of themselves ask Bin Saud to rule over them at once. (g) IRA&gt;&lt;* claims to Kuwait were ridiculous and would not be tolerated at all by the King. ^en x asked Philby wha t sort of men composed the; Saudi Gonsnission that was shortly to come to Kuwait, he replied that they were all eminently reasonable Nejdis, but could be counted to give nothing away. 7w - — 5 (#9 ./lien I asked if he knew what sort of proposals they would out forward for settling the impasse with Kuwait Philby replied n It is not their business to put forward proposals it is up to Kuwait to do this- The King naturally wants the 'Status quo', ha wants no settlement, his object is to starve Kuwait into submission^or it is only a question of time whan this will happen - In Mubarak’s tine Kuwait us tons revenue was lb ires, today it is 1 lac* If in 23 yaars the Kuwait Customs has dropped from 13 to 1 I leave it to you, Dickson, to calculate when it will become nothing'. agree to come to an agreement on the principle of customs posts and manifests,jqpU«K Philby said 'No certainly not'. This would involve Bin Saud in expense where now he has none - i/hy should he spend money to please Kuwait and His Majesty’s Government. Bin Saud would agree to, he replied that as f*r as he knew Bin Saud might accept one of two things (a) A lumpsum down annually from the Shaikh of Kuwait (b) Some sort of transit duty system. but 'remember' he added 'we do not want e settlement'. IQ # Throu gh put our talk Philby gave every indication that he had the King’s ear, and was his close admirer and so spoke with authority: This though it may only have been bombast, may be significant. I of course am an old friend of Philby and no doubt this fact made him speak possibly more openly, than he would have done elsewhere. ^ 2 ' The above raaarks are, I consider, interesting and highly important as they bear out exactly what the 8 I then asked whether he thought the Iking would 9 To my query as to whst he personally thought ShaikhShaikh of Kuwait ia never tired of saying day in and day out, namely that the work of the delegates is not only going to be a farce for the simple reason that they will have had previous instructions not to agree to any Customs post and manifest system (the only thing ac ceptdble to Kuwait), but that the real intention of Bin Baud is to manoeuvre Kuwait into a false position with His Majesty’s Government, In other words Bin Baud will be able to say to His Majesty’s Government and to the people of Kuwait, if the conference fails, 'You see, I told you so, my delegates made several most reasonable offers, but brother ivhmad, stiff necked and unaccommodating as ever, will agree to nothing I propose, I leave His *uajesty’s Govern ment and Kuwait merchants to judge who is at fault therefor I or him,' IB. In this way, as Shaikh idnnad says, it is hoped by Bin Baud that he, Ahmad, will once again, be condemned by His Majesty’s Government as the unreasonable villain of the piece and will more particularly lose popularity in the eyes of his own hard pressed people. 14. I myself cannot but help (with my long local experience) being fully and entirely in agreement with all that the Bhaikh says in this matter, for we must never forget that he is up against the 'big bad v^olf than whom nobody in -tvrabia is so cunning# 15, X trust that His Majesty’s Government will bear the above remarks of Bhalich in mind, as the time draws near for the conference to be held.

Shaikh certainly cannot afford entertain such large party as mentioned by Minister and I fear Saudi Governments proposed figures tend to oonfinn my previous views that intention is to spoil chances of conference. It should not be difficult to limit numbers of guards to one per car with one servant for each delegate. Local custom would certainly not be outraged, and obvious effort to reduce numbers would be correspondingly appreciated by Shaikh. When ohaikh visited Riath in 1932 cars numbered ten and total number party was under fifty even though three senior members of ~1 ^abah accompanied Shaikh. It is interesting to record also that Philby and his wife recently crossed ^rabia with no guard at all. -POLITICAL-Telegram I.F.O. 1927 &amp; 30. From To No. Dated Hetaxandum, London.

Following is very condensed summary. Saudi Govemrrent have held enquiry, and are still pursuing it as they do not wish any incident to disturb their relations H.M. Government and bhaikh, who is King’s intimte friend. In view facts ascer tained they chiefly regeet that this simple incident should be represented as armed incursion intended to violate bhaikh’s southern border. Movement betv/een two countries of subjects and messengers carrying arms is an every day occurence. Persons now in question were four not six. Th-v belonged to a party of his retainers whom Governor of Hassa had deputed for the assembling of tribe semen at a certain spot, and to collect ZIKkT. bhammar had been sunmoned to Mutair watering places but on arrival party found that they were still in Kuwait territory. Commander therefore sent messengers to Kuwait, to telegraph Governor for instructions. Naturally route was via Subahiyeh and Jabara. Messengers may have informed tribesi:Bn whom they met on the way where Zikat was being collected, so that they £hould make haste pay- riBnt. Having picked up a car three messengers went on toi (g&gt; 1' on to Kuwait to telegraph, whereupon they were ordered out of Kuwait territory. It should be further noted that the crossing of frontier in both directions by armed parties without permission is normal, e.g. Kuwait messengers go to Kiath and Hassa f and members of Shaikh of Kuwait's family visit Saudi Arabia accompanied his troops to hunt. If Government Kuwait object^ visits of Saudi subjects, and messengers, Government musl'apply reciprocal treatment, though they consider it contrary prevailing friendship, and to efforts they are making to promote economic relations. In view of treatment accorded to his messengers, Governor Hassa has been instructed prevent all entry agreement, Kuwait authorities should prohibit officials and others from entering Saudi territory for any purpose, without previous permission, as expulsion messengers has caused perturbation amongst tribesmen and has been regarded as hostile action at a time when oaudi Government are straining every nerve to establish a close and friendly relations with her into Kuwait.

Political Agent Kuwait telegraphs that Shaikh is most upset at number delegates party and while he will do his best, he earnestly trusts that figure will be reduced through H.M.G’s efforts. On his visit Riath (para 2 of Jedda telegram) Shaikh took 40 men but cases are not on all fours as Shaikh was invited by Ibn Saud for friendly visit, while this is a business conference. y'' A 2. Shaikh will not object to Qusaibi (para 6 of Jedda telegram) although he regards him as prime insti- gator of Blockade. 3. Situation foreshadowed in my express letter No. 317.S dated 24th April ' By RYAN would now seem to be developing, and ^audi government by their obstructive attitude (inter alia raising their delegates party to a preposterous number; with drivers and servants, it would be near hundred) are in my opinion doing their best to torpedo conference, or alternatively to shame and fcumiliate Shaikh by imposing on him expense of a 'counter demonstration' (para 4 of / / Jedda telegram). In the case of Bahrain conference, total ^&gt;audiSaudi party consisted of about ten only. 4 * ^baikh as will be seen is most reasonable but I do not think we should allow him to suffer the demonstration proposed by Saudi Government. ^* fhe re can in my opinion be no question of Saudi guards entering Kuwait territory which i s contrary to international practice, ^audi delegation can be accompanied up to Kuwait frontier by as many guards as Saudi govt, thinks necessary. There these guards will be left behind, and Shaikh’s guards will escort delegation to Kuwait. I venture to suggest that this should be put to Saudi Government with addition that H.M.G. consider that a total of 25 including drivers arxl servants is ample for dele gat e sapar ty. That if this proposal is not accepted H.M.G. will be compelled to assume that Saudi Govt, do not wish conference to take place. -IIESIDENT-Telegram I.F.O. 1927 &amp; 30 From Minister, Jedda* Political, Kuwait 139.

Subject to these factors I suggest I should reply on the following (general) lines before I leave June 7th. messenger did not belong King’s organised forces but were ordinary retainers of governor Hasa. It is never theless clear that they belonged to a party sent by him in the first place to collect Zikat. If they simply intended to go Kuwait for the purpose indicated, they exposed themselves to grave misunderstanding by staying two days at Subahiyeh and diverging from usual route to visit Jahara. It could only infer by these disclosures, and from language held by them to tribes, that their mission was to bring pressure on them while still in r . 3 H.M. Government are glad 7 infer that KuwaitKuwait territory ; to return to Saudi Arabia and pay Zikat. H,M. Government hope that steps will be taken to prevent recurrence such action, which presents at least the appearance of an attempt to exercise authority in King’s name outside his territory. For rest neither they nor Shaikh wish to interfere with any existing practice as regards crossing frontier for legitimate purposes. On the contrary theij, welcome the assurance of Saudi Govt, for their desire to promote the restoration of economic relations which have long been interrupted. It was because they shared this desire that they did not on their side in any way connect incident of May 6th with arrangement for proposed conference. -MINISTER-1 (7fy 1 Telegram I.ff.O. 1937 &amp; 30. ^ rom Resident, H.M.S.

I venture suggest it might be added that had Saudi party borne letters from Saudi authorities addressed Shaikh and had gone direct, or even without letters had taken this course, Shaikh would doubtless have assisted them to carry out their mission.

Use of expression 'guards' may have created u n duly alarming impression. As I unci erst an u. it men in question will be armed retainers, whose attendance is regarded in Arabia as essential dignity for important persons wherever they go, and whatever 4 » T* purpose journey. I had already informed Saudi govt, on strength Kuwait telegram 158 to me, that Shaikh would not object to moderate number guards. This precludes line suggested in first part para No. 5 telegram ! under reference. In any case European conceptions of International practice are so alien to question as to make it impossible negotiate on that basis. It would moreover be undesirable in my opinion to haggle over particular numbers especially as I have no longer any means of discussing matter orally and amicably with any responsible authority. 4 I still regard number attendants as excessive, but Kuwait differs from Bahrain. I believe in that 1 that Shaikh himself surrounds himself with largenumbers of armed men. 5. My appreciation Ibn Saud’s attitude is tiiat he will stick to his 'counter demonstration' till all is blue, but will be all the more inclined to make a show of reasonableness at conference. This opinion is confirmed by note summarised in my telegram 121. The conference may fail in any case but if you are to attach importance to it as a stage out, efforts settle blockade question, I now consider that best course will be to reply to that note on the lines suggested in my telegram 122, and inform Saudi Govt. simultaneously that while number attendants whom they propose sendjncg with delegates is much which greater than the number that His Majesty’s Govt., had expected, they will raise no objection their entry into Kuwait. 6. If any other line is taken, there can be no doubt that it is we who shall be accused of wishing to torpedo conference, and whole method handling blockade question will have to be reconsidered. -MINISTER-m+M.

Shaikh argued very heatedly with me yesterday to effect that.- (a) Neither Bin Saud nor he had sought Conference. (b) Former because he naturally did not wish abandon lucrative blockade, and he because he knows that no amount of talking will force Bin Saud ^o do so, if the will is not there. (c) He has told H.M.G. before that only hope of success is in direct pressure on Bin Saud. If this course does not commend itself, then much better drop whole question.

Da t ed 18th June m5 ' Saudi -^uwal t_ Bloc kad e_ Confer e n oe'' . ! In continuation oT my telegram No. 184 dated the 16th June 1935, I beg to report that the Saudi delegation oonsising of (a) Khalid ibn al Walid. (b) Hamad al Suleiman. (o) Abdulla al Qusaibi. arrived at Kuwait in the early morning of 16th June from Hoffuf. y 2 * The party came in seven lorries and six touring cars and were accompanied by 70 attendants (including drivers, servants and guards) • 3. The delegates reported that they lost their way the 2nd day out of Hoffuf, and narrowly escaped disaster and death from thirst owing to not being able to find water, which they had counted on. They also ran short of petrol when they at last reached 1 fj Jarriya Ilya, and two single lorries had to go ahead and bring , bach petrol from Kuwait to enable the main body to come on. That made them a whole 24 hours late in Kuwait.4# The losing of their way and the ridiculous decision to send lorries with the party, reflects very badly on the Saudi Government's n bundobast ,, , for lorries are the worst possible means of motor conveyance, once sumuer has set in and drift sand has to be negotiated in the desert* One can only say that we in Kuwait would have put up a much better show, the positions been reversed. 5 . On arrival in Kuwait the delegates were given refreshments and made comfortable, after which they called on His Excellency the Shaikh, and Khalid ibn al Walid presented a personal letter from H.M. King Abdul Aziz. 6 . After leaving the Shaikh's presence they called on me, and similarly handed to me a short personal letter from the King, which expressed the hope that the efforts oi the delegates would be crowned with success and trusting that I would give them my tfull support. 7 . Khalid Ibn al Walld appeared to be the leader of the party, and directed the conversations, as if he had been instructed bef oretend to adopt that role. In appearance he resembled a thick set German, being vary fair with a small blond heard. He described himself to me as a Tripolitan, and said that he had served a period of five years detention in Home for his desert activities against Italy, and that for later rebellion in the hinterland of Tripoli, had narrowly escaped being sent to Italy onoe again when he finally had to take refuge in ^ ^ 1164 ^ ^ His going to the Heja, and subsequently to Bin Sand's Court t history for he had only been there five years, was recent history, j. ^ . admiration f &lt;r the Italian arts and nobilily Though he expressed admiral. . „ tha t he was anti European, and he conveyed the impression that 4.4 t otin races of Europe* especially anti Latin r HeHe rolunteered the information that he spoke French and Italian fluently, and said that he had beai brought up in Turkey and knew my graJadfather there. 8 . Neither HamAd al Sulaiman nor Abd\illa al ^usaibi impressed me much, but one gathered that they both had quite a large store of Nejdi rudeness and obstinacy in their make up. 9 . On the whole the composition of the party struck me fairly favourably, though the tf Effend!' characteristics of their leader and his frequest use of French words, during the subsequent discussions with the more untutored Kuwait delegates, savoured of a studied desire to show his superiority and to patronize them - It was resented accordingly. 10. The first discussion took place at 8 A.M. on 17th June, Kuwait being represented by the following delegates the delegates arrived. I adopted the role of looker on or 'mthir' on behalf of H.M. Government. 11 . A note on the first and subsequent diseussions is A note on submitted with this. . - Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.NOTE ON THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE SAUDI DELEGATES AND THE KUWAIT REPRESENTATIVES, AS THEY TOOK PLaCE EACH DAY. (The notes were written up immediately after each meeting, as the Saudi delegates showed nervousness at my taking * notes at the meeting itself). FIRST DAY LKtHONDAY 17th JUHK) . (a) Proceedings lasted from 8 A.M. to 9.30 A.M.. and were opened by a brief speech by the Political Agent wishing both parties success in their deliberation and asking God to bless their efforts. (b) Khali d i bn al 7/a lid then opened the ball on behalf of the Saudi Government by a long winded and somewhat offensive speech, in which he said that the King had instructed him to say that he had no personal enmity ' for Kuwait; that he had sent him and his friends to see whether a 'modus vivendi' could be cane to, over the Blockade question: That they, the Saudi delegates, would listen to anything reasonable the Kuwaitis had to say, but fran the first he must warn them that 'Business was business, that sentiment would not be allowed to play any part in the proceedings': That he could tell them from the beginning, that Bin Saud, hii master would agree to no settlement unless he bene fited equally with Kuwait: That the Saudi Government was a poor one and had to fight all the time to find meens of getting revenue, so that no proposals of the Kuwait delegates would be acceptable or even be con sidered unless they could show, some sort of finan cial advantage to Saudi Arabia. That the King had blockaded Kuwait,with the delibe rate intention of diverting trade to his own ports - That be had succeeded in this,and had now got that trac and that therefore,if it pleased him to allow Kuwait to get'a little bit' of it back,it must be on 'terms That the@ !l L 1 That the Saudi Government did not, in any way, want to raise the blockade and give anything back to Kuwj but out of friendship for the British Government, tl Xing was willing to discuss matters always provided that Kuwait would make a 'worth while' offer. That first and foremost therefore and before an£ discussions or Arguments could be listened to, the Kuwait delegates must state in the form af a letter to him, exactly what they were prepared to concede by w^r of advantage to Bin Baud, and exactly what their proposals were; This would be telegraphed to *He had used the King,and his orders taken. But the terms must the French * equivalents be'conerste T ’, and of an entirely 'positive' nature. for concrete which he rudely reminded the Kuwait delegates that Kuwait was in the position of a person in prison, who was anxious to get out; They jailer was &amp; man open to reason, and awaited an offer from the prisoner - If this was good he would open the pris gates. Mote bv the writer . To my mind speeches (b) and (c) dbo- W ere gratuitously insulting, and the Kuwait delegates, I (d) Abdulla al Qusalhi passed no remarks. (e) Zald &amp;1 iaial l&amp; on behalf of the Kuwait delegates then replied briefly, to the effect ttet and positive. X V _ a * (c) bln oulaiman followed by half a dozen words in could see, were deeply hurt, to prevent hot repli®®* I had to intervene tactfully he was sorry •ry that the Saudi delegates had chosen to role of 'parliaentaires” so to speak from will-3- /rt r&amp; will to Kuwait f and then at the next, they (the delegates) talked about Kuwait being in the position of a prisoner, who if he only would offer a high enough bribe, would be allowed out, TherKuwait, seeing that she was the aggrieved party, had really little to offer. All she wanted was an honest outlet for her trade with ^asim and Ihe Interior, and wished to do business in honest and straightforward manner. That since the Chief spokesman of the Saudi Government had invited them to say what Kuwait was prepared to offer - his reply was Government (i) To pay full Saudi/Customs on all merchandise going from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia, (ii) To pay such duty at one or more Customs Posts which should be established on the Saudi side of the frontier, (iii) To allow no caravans from Nejd towns to leave Kuwait without proper manifests taken in triplicate - one to be given to the leader of the caravan, the other sent to the Saudi Govern ment through A1 Nafisi and the third to remain with the Kuwait Government. (iv) Nejd Bedouin to be allowed to make minor purchases for their own every day needs free of interference, but Aould they desire to take goods out of Kuwait above a certain quantity (this to be fixed after discussion) then they phould likewise be given manifests. u « 4 - ■♦■'hi«s a'hasQ of th© shaikh of No mention was made at this stage or . •,* ™&lt;.«vp nronosal viz. that he should nit’s second alternative p P as Bin Baud's Customs officer. , +=,«. asked that the above proposal be The Saudi delegates askea w civ angiven in writiug the same evening, if possible, and they would telegraph it to the King. (g) The Kwrait delegates agreed,subject to the Shaikh's approval. (h) I here remarked that, speaking quite unofficially, I thought that the Kuwait terms appeared reasonable,and that from my personal knowledge of the hinterland, the placing of one Customs Post at f Safa f or four posts at the wells of Hafar, Safa, Jarriya and Nta,would effec tually close any gaps, and be a complete success. To this the leader of the Saudi Delegation smilingly replied that he knew nothing at all of the terrain of the Kuwait frontier, but that he definitely could say that the idea of Customs Posts would certainly not meet with the King's approval, seeing that Ihey would be costly. Nevertheless * if the Kuwait delegates put the proposal in writing, he would refer it to His Majesty. I pointed out that Bin Saud was already spending money on frontier preventive force of 30 men, these would still be necessary under the Customs Posts and Manifest System. All that would be required extra, would be four to six Customs clerks, to take over the Customs duty when paid. (i) The Kuwait delegates then tried to initiate an open dis cussion as to the merits of the Manifest System and to explain details of how it would work etc. But the leader of the Saudi Delegation refused to talk or discuss the matter at all. He said that until he referred Kuwaiti suggestion to the King discussion ms a pure waste of time. He then got up with his friends and left the meeting. The day’s proceedings then ended. (j) Before adjourning the leader of the Saudi delegation made the cool request that 1 should take over and pay for all their telegrams to Riath. I declined politely. I agreed however to wire the Director General Posts and Telegraphs,Baghdad and ask if IBAq, and the Saudi Govt, had come to any arrangement on the question of telegrams going free from Kuwait to the »-ing regarding the Conference • Note-5- Note by the writer * (i) ‘i’he ImpressioiiBleft on me at the close of the first day’s proceedings were the reverse of favourable. The whole tone of the Saudi delegates was too haughty and uncompromising. The spirit of good will was conspicuous by its absence. (ii) The superior airs of the Saudi delegates’ leader (almost invariably adopted, I regret to say, by Saudi officials) created a bad impression and hazarding a guess, I should say* was deliberately done to irritate. (iii) The head of the delegation made it clear that he believed the King would revest the Customs rests and Manifest System, on the lame excuse that it would cost too much money. (iv) The continual hints of n make it worth our while financially end we will business', savoured far too mud! of 'give -os a good subsidy, and we will open the Kuwait frontier'. Perhaps this is wbatthe Saudi dele gation is working up for. If so,it is the same proposal that Bin 3aud hi™elf put forward several years ago, and which was rejected. (v) The Saudi delegation would appear to possess no authority to do anything on their own, and it looks as if they tIH refer everything to the King. .'Txrvrawn oN q? yiuST j A?_.U7thjbaal-- u , y received a telegram froa the Director General v.

Tills had. been arranged between us prior to the break up of the meeting of tbc previous day. The Saudi delegates however did not turn up, but sent a message to sey that as they had nothing to discuss pending receipt of the King's reply to their telegrem, they did not propose attending the meeting. This rudeness was rather typical and shocked the cif- polite Kuwait 7 not a little. I incidentally was tola that the Shaikh's daily menu for the 3 audi delegates and party was sir sheep a day and two bags of rioe. This apart from a host of good things such as fruits and sweetmeats (in easy Hs. 150/- a day). TTTTR'D HAY (WEDN ^DAY 19 th JUNSl# (i) I was ready at 8 A.M. as uaial to attaid the Conference, but received early notice from the Shaikh’s Secretary, that the Saudi Delegation had sent word that they could discuss nothing and attend no further meetings pending orders from the King. (ii) In the evening I saw the Shaikh while playing tennis - He smilingly asked what I thought of the Saudi woSTd (delegation) and their methods at the first meeting. (ill)(iii) I replied cautiously that I hoped still that all would he right. (It) He laughingly cantinued 'How you ha ire seen them and the big talk they use, perhaps you and your Government now see that sometimes Shaikh Ahmad, their small friend and ally is right. I have already prophesied and told you many tines that Bin Saud means to do absolutely nothing, and that he has merely sent his delegaton after having practically received orders to do so from His Majesty’s Government. Having gone so far he will do no more, but will now work for a good excuse or 'hujja' to bring about a failure of the conference. Believe me nothing we offer will be acceptable, except the paymoit of an enormous subsidy, or the surrender of Kuwait.' (v) The Shaikh then went on to say that certain 'stragglers' had now come in from Jarriya, and that .he numbers of the Saudi delegation had reached a total of 83 persons - The feeding of these was a difficult business and cost money, but as it apparently pleased His Majesty’s Goyernment that the delegates were in Kuwait, he was not going to complain.. He wondered (said laughingly) whether it would ewer strike His Majesty's Government to reimburse him for these entertainment expenses, rtilchopinea would not fall far short of Hs. 10 , 000 /-.

Your Royal Highness, After Compliments, ftith reference to my personal conversation with His Excellency Sheykh Yusuf Yasin on May 6 th, I have the honour to state that 1 have now received further particulars regarding the fcrmed party which entered Kuwait territory on or about May 6 th. The party consisted of six persons under the command of a certain Haif Abu Shigra. They stayed two days at Subaihiya and proceeded from there to Jahra, a place distant only twenty miles from the town of Kuwait. They themselves stated that they belonged to the armed forces of the Saudi a overnment. It wae underotood in Kuwait that they worn acting under the orders of the Governor of Rasa, who had sent them from Hofuf to prevent sections of the Sharamar tribe from grazing in Kuwait territory. I cannot vouch for the belief that the party were despatched by the Governor of Hasa but it is certain that they in faxt penetrated far into the territory of His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait and ordered persons of the Shamraar tribe who were camped in that territory, at the two places named above, to leave it. Th^r gave s n orders to members of the Dhafj.r J, rxbe at another place in the Shaikh’s territory. They were naturally arreoted and taken to Kuwait, but the authorities there, believed ing them to belong to the Saudi forces and not wishing to envenom the situation, allowed tfrem to return to Hasa. 1/ Ecfy&amp;l Hiess The Minister for Foreign /if fair a.I am confident that Your Soyal Highness will appreciate the gravity of this incident, the importance of which ie increased by the fact of its having occurred at a time wher. the Saudi Government and His Majesty's \ Government in the United Kingdom are uriting their efforte in the most friendly spirit to remove all causes of difference between them, His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait has requested my Government to take the necessary act on and they have instructed me to protest strongly against this invasion of Kuwait territory by armed persons professing to be in the service of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz and claiming the right to exercise authority there in the name of His Majesty* I have the honour to request that the uilty parties may be suitably punished and that I may be infored of the action taken, With highest respects, \HEREW RYAE.CONFIDENTIAL.

Express Letter No. C-190 dated 18th June 1955. (1) Delegates of both sides met at 8 A.M. on Saturday in Shaikh’s Mejliss room as usual, and meeting lasted from 8 till 9 A.M. (see my telegram No.200 of 21st June). I was of course present. (2) Before business actually started Chief Saudi delegate asked if 1 had had any news by Radio of world affairs and I told him of the Naval Agreement with Oexmany and -Amir Baud’s doings in London as well as further details of the Quetta earthquake. (3) Business opened by the uhief Baud! delegate saying that a reply had be® received from H.M. tne King, to effect that Kuwait delegates should be ashed whether in ev*t of Customs Posts and Manifest* System being in traduced (a) The -wait &amp;ed A.

Government would give a written document to the Saudi Government, guaranteeing *at all smuggling from Kuwaitfrom xCuwait to Nejd would cease forthwith, (b) That if Kuwait Govemmait would not do this whether H.M.Cr, would be willing to give necessary written guarantee* (c) That it was insaaterial who gave guarantee, H.M.G, or Kuwait, but guarantee must be given to King. He as senior Saudi delegate therefore puts above questions to both Kuwait delegates and to me, as representing H.M.Gr. (See my telegram No. 203 of 22nd June to Bushire). ( 4 ) Before giving reply, the Kuwait delegates asked what was meant by 'Kuwait guaranteeing that there should be no further smuggling across the frontier once the manifest system was started”. To this Khalid ibn al fialid answered, that he thought that he had put his question plainly, but to make things quit&lt; .Vhen asked how it was proposed that Kuwait should carry out such unreasonable guarantee, the reply consider himself Justified In denouncing any arrived at', wmh agreement arrived at'. came quick caught running contraband fx'&lt; Into Saudi Arabia by Saudi f: the origin of goods was said in an endeavour The reply- 10 - The reply was u ait will be held responsible, for it will be up to her to stop all good going even over the IKa^ border, if such goods eventually find their way into Saudi Arabia, and it can be proved that the origin was Kuwait'. Another Kuwait delegate asked whether it was proposed to invite IRA^ and Trans Jordan to give rv guarantee that no snuggling went across the border - but no reply was given. (5) After scan© further discussion amongst themselves the Kuwait delegates replied that as Kuwait would find it quite impossible to carry out the under taking required of them and as they felt that the demand was entirely unreasonable, they must re jest same and give a negative answer. At the same time they said that the undertaking they could and would give if the King would agree to it was 'The Kuwait (Jovemmant promises to do its honest best to put a stop to all smuggling into Nejd, and gives its word of honour to this effect' ( 6 ) The Senior Saudi delegate then asked me*, if H.M. Gr. would give the necessary guarantee . To this I replied with a No! pointing out that Ihe question was one bet we on iiiwai’a on Liau.ciiyiJ'i and did not directly concern H.M.Government. ( 7 ) The Senior Saudi Delegate then said he would refer Kuwait f s reply, which ms taken down in writing, to the King, and the meeting adjourned. the cat out of the bag' somewhat by remarking ( 8 ) Before the deletes actually left the room, ths second Saudi delegate, Hamad bin Sulaiman,'let in grumbling tone that for his part he saw no point at all- 11 - / u point at all in the Customs Posts and 'Manifest bystem', that it was waste of time to talk furth L\T fihen asked why he said this, he replied that he for one would never trust the Kuwait Customs authorities, and he saw no reason why a manifest should he given for 100 bags of sugar say to go ■to H9jd&gt; when in reality 200 bags went out with the same caravan. (The odd 100 being earmarked as contraband to be run, as soon as caravan was near the border). The Kuwait delegates replied hotly that theirs was Government as Saudi Arabia was, and that all further talks would be quite useless, if distrust of this sort was going to govern the minds of the Saudi Delegates: I managed to make peace, but the Saudi delegate was certainly asking for trouble, (9) After the meeting had adjourned, I called on the Shaikh to discuss Political Resident’s telegram No, 540 of 21st June 1935 in which I was asked to try and persuade Shaikh to extend tix:e of &gt;he eonferenee, eveh/himself was determined to leave for London on 24th June, The Shaikh listened to me carefully and asked me to give reply to the Political Resident that he personally had a'^te definitely come to the conclusion as a result of the first meeting only Of his Deletes with those of Bin Saud, _ . _ «,« meant, and that Bin Saud, s aw daylight- 12 - as daylight• That he (sKailch) fully realised (with the Political Resident) that Bin Baud’s next move would probably be to try and fasten the blame on him (Ahmad) for a break down of discussions. In order to forestall possibility of this, he had taken the following action on Friday 22nd June (although of course his coming departure was already known to Saudi delegates and to Bin Baud). (a) He had called officially on Saudi delegates and explained that he had to leave for London on Monday 24th June in accordance with a programme arranged 3 months ago - That his departure need not affect Conference in least, as Shaikh Abdulla as Salim, his cousin would take over the reins of Government, and they,the delegates,could look upon him as they as they looked upon himself, viz as Shaikh of Kuwait. That they were guests of Kuwait, and must \ not hesitate to stay as long they thought fit in Kuwait for the purpose of carrying the discussions to their logical and he hoped successful conclusion. (b) He sent a telegram on the same lines as (a) above, to Bin Saud, trusting that Saudi Delegates would continue their labours after his departure under the aegis of Shaikh Abdulla. (See my telegram fa No. 204 of 22nd June to Bushire). Note. The same evening at a banquet givaa by the Shaikh in honour of the Saudi Delegates (at which all the heads of the State were present), the Shaikh age in expressed the hope that the delegates would continue their labours after his departure, and then read out the king's reply telegram, which had in the meantime arrived. This was very graciously worded, and wished his brother Ahmad «God speed and an early return in completely restored health”. Mm that the ^Sf^lL&amp;SioL.

SEVENTH BAT (SUNDAY 23rd JIMS) . No meeting. EIGHTH DAT (MONDAY 24th JUNE) , (1) The Saudi and Kuwait delegates met at 8 A»M, and once again for two hours discussed the nature and meaning from all angles of the 'guarantee' which Bin Saud required from the Kuwait Government, as a condition to his agreeing to the Customs Posts and M Manifest System. ( s6a telegram No. 211 of 25.6.S5) (2) The Senior Saudi Delegate explained at length that, when he had said at the last meeting that Bin Saud was willing to agree to the 'Customs Posts and Manifest System' being introduced, on condition that the Kuwait Government guaranteed by written documsit that smuggling into Saudi Arabia will forthwith oease, he had meant by that, that wen if a single smuggler from Kuwait was caught by the Saudi frontier guards, the Shaikh of Kuwait would have broken his agreement and it would be open to the King to cancel any trade agreement arrived at at once if he chose# (3) When pressed by the &amp;mit Delegates to ®y what would actually happen in practice under Ihe scheme as visualized hy him (the Senior Saudi Delegate), the latter replied that in his opinion, if for instance, one smuggler the frontier his camel from Kuwait was caught on and goods would be confiscated the first(4) the first time, and a bill for the Customs recover able would be sent to the Shaikh of Kumit, who wouK be expected to pay. The same thing would happen up to a limit of three times . After that the King would have the clear rigit, and would exercise such right, to cancel the whole Trade Agreement on the ground that Kuwait had failed in her guarantee The Kuwait delegates argued very vigorously that suoh one sided conditions were not only unfair in the extreme, hut left any agreement arrived at entirely at the mercy of the King, who could kill or keep it alive as he chose, seeing that all the world knew that the smuggling fraternity existed even in the most well ordered and modem States. In other words they said that a grade which was to be developed, opened up and financed by Nejd and Kuwait merchants jointly, and could fall to the ground any momaut because forsooth 3 rascally smugglers might happen to get caught within a period of perhaps a week, a month or six months, was useless to them; Quije clearly therefore they could give no guarantee under suoh conditions. (5) The Saudi delegates said they quite saw their point, but Kuwait delegates must also^theirs. The King 9' had giyen than thair orders, olearly, unequivocally. These were that they (his delsgates) must maics it clear Uiat the haslo principle of any trade agree ment that was to he negotiated was to be this -guarantee' or 'tbaman'. If the Kuwait deletes chose to give the guarantee, then talks could be continued, if not then they had nothing further to do hut go home. (6)-15- 16) I here myself interfered and said I thought it would be a thousand pities if for the sake of this one word 'thaman' or 'guarantee', the negotiations were to break down, and I urged the Saudi delegates to make things a little easier, for die Kuwait delegates clearly could not give a 'clear out premise' to prevent any single snuggler from crossing the border, when next day they would be proved liars# I pointed out that supposing England and France s were trying to come to a trade agreement, advantageou to the traders of both countries, what possible chance would the agreement have of going through,if France for instance insisted on a clause giving them the power to cancel the agreement without notice,if one English smuggler was caught within the territo rial waters of France. ( The Sauil delegates saw my point, hut said I must not apply European standards to Kuwait and Nejd# (7) Not to be out done and seeing that we were nearing ih impasse, I asked if smuggling went on between Bahrain and Qatar and Hassa - they admitted that a certain amount did - n well ,, I said, 'do you not think in fairness that you ought to ask the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar, to give a'guarantee' that no smugglers would operate from these countries into Nejd'. The reply was that circumstances altered oases# (8) The Kuwait delegates once again stated that if the King would only drop the 'guarantee' or 'thaman” condition, they for their part would readily give a written document on behalf of Ku*it 'promising on the honour of the Shaikh, the merchants and people of Kuwait to do their best, and by erery means-16- / means in their power to reduce smuggling to a minimum' This the Saudi delegates refused to consider, or even telegraph to the King. It was case of 'thamsai' or nothing now. (9) Seeing that things were ag;in getting A the danger point, I adjourned the meeting myself, under tl» excuse that no doubt the delegates all desired to bid fhrewell to tho Shaikh who was about to leave for London by air. (10) It was only too evident to me that the Saudi dele^ites had received new instructions frcm 1he King, not to budge an inch from the 'guarantee' idea, and that they knew full well that Ihe Kuwait delegates could not accept such conditions, and were out to force an issue on this point. Probably the next day or two will therefore see the break down of discussions. (a) An hour after the adjournment of the meeting described above, Ike Saudi delegates addressed a letter dated 84th June 1935 to the Kuwait delegates, translation attached /S/?/{and marked B), which was dearly meant to define their position. The Kuwait delegates at once replied by a similar letter dated 25th June 1935 recapitulating everything that the LATER. ./?4this letter is attached (and marked C). Note . Both these letta opinion, as the}' P 3 - the responsibility for unfortunately eminent. for the break down of negotiations now(b) I omitted to mention above, that during the debate of the morning, I enquired trm the Senior Saudi delegate as to whether from reports and statistics at his disposal, he thought much smuggling went across the frontier into Saudi Arabia from Kuwait today . The answer was 'Very little indeed 5 , perhaps one smuggler is caught per month'. I next suggested that this desirable state of affairs was no doubt due to the splendid control maintained on the frontier by the King’s preventive guards and their Ganmander A1 Bagaawi - 'That was so' - came the reply. I then suggested, (emphasizing that I put the question purely out of a desire to help in removing obstacles to an agreement) that as Saudi frontier control was so good today and as to existing frontier guards would certainly remain on even if the 'Customs Poets and Manifest System' were introduced, ’whether he and his brother delegates could not see their way to waive the 'guarantee clause', seeing that it was for all practical purposes quite necessary. The Senior delegate said he saw my point, but could not budge from the standpoint already taken up by him - (In an private aside to me he said he could not go against the King’s orders In this matter, for th.y were very explicit). .

Such conversations, however, must be on the one clear basis, that the Govern ment of Kuwait shall give 'guar an tee” (dhaman) with regard to goods passing (across frontier) to His Majesty the King’s territory (i.e. that nothing is smuggled apart from goods sent under manifests).

You added that if our delegation would agree to the 'guarantee' condition on behalf of the Kuwait Governmait, then you would be prepared to continue the talks# We wish therefore now to make the matter quite clear. The situation is, as we suggested to you in our letter dated die 16th Rabi f Auwal 1354 (17.6.35), and as was also discussed with you in yesterday morning’s meeting (24.6.35). You stated that the ^guarantee' system was desired by His Majesty’s (Saudiyeh) Government, which was that nothing should be smuggled, and only goods exported according to manifests should be allowed to pass into Saudi Territory. That should any smuggler be oau^it, his goods would be confiscated, and the Kuwait Government would have to pay the Customs duty imposed on same. Also that should this happen more than three times, His Ma Jasty’s Sefldi GcYemmmt should te ^ the right to oanoal the agreement. At me same meeting we replied to you that Kuwait thdo all in hor power to prevent smuggling. And t&amp;at should any smuggling be discovered (within her territory) the Kuwait Government would inflict the severest of punishments on the evil-doer. As regards the 'guarantee' insisted on by you - with every precautions taken and every good will, we say tnis cannot be realized. Hence it is not reasonable of you to make such a condition. That which the Saudi Government is afraid of (e.g. smuggling), should it occur, will be trifling and very small, because of the measures that will be taken by His Majesty^ Saudi Government and the Government of Kuwait. It should certainly not effect the good will, and the desire for a reciprocal* agreement between His Majesty the King and Hie Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir. deep insigrt you will not allow a doubtful and unrea sonable defect to stand in the way of good understanding. We beg for a reply to this, and express the hope that we shall come to a good understanding.

ELEVENTH DAY (THDRSDiff 27th JUNE) . No meeting. TWELFTH DAY (FRIDAY 28th JUNE) . (1) The Saudi Delegates called a meeting at 8 A # M. and as usual I attended. (2) Before the meeting started they asked to see me alone. I agreed. The Saudi Delegates at this private meeting told me that they had received a reply from the King the previous night to the effect that they must tell the Kuwait delegates that if they did not forthwith agree to give the 'guarantee** asked for by the King, they, the Saudi delegates must close down discussions and return to Riyath at once. (3) They then begged me to see the Kuwait Delegates alone in the same way as I had seen them, and to explain that the final stages had been reached, and that things were no longer in their hands. That the King*s wishes were law, and that from the start, they had bean given no real proper authority to negotiate 'give and take', or bargain as they would have liked. That the only thing that they could do now was to advise Kuwait to agree to the 'guarantee' required of th®, and try the scheme out for 6 mon*s - After that boththat both sides could renew or cancel as they liked. (4) I replied that I saw very little hope of the Kuwait delegates agreeing, seeing that they too had their strict orders from the Shaikh, and to agree to such an impossible thing as the 'guarantee” required of them, was tantamount to putting themselves into the hands of the first three rogues t^sft felt they had a grievance against the Shaikh: I however agreed to deliver their message to the Kuwait delegates (now waiting in an adjoining room). (5) As I expected, the latter rejected the proposition quietly and firmly and obviously with great feeling and regret, after which they joined the Saudi Celestes with me* (6) Here the Senior Saudi Delegate explained what had happened, and could only tell them of the King’s tele gram. It was a case of could they agree to the 'guarantee' now and at the eleventh hour or not. Xf not they, the Saudi Delegates, had their orders to end the discussions and go home. (7) The Kuwait delegates expressed their very great disappointment at tha King’s ultimatum, and said they oould definitely not go further than they had gone already. If the Saudi Delegatee had no fresh suggestions to make, lien they supposed the converse- tions must end. (8) The Senior Saudi Delegate then asked leave to close the proceedings, and I as H.M. Government’s representative^ oould do nothing else but agree. ( 9 ) Then followed much polite speechifying, on the part of the Saudi Delegates, who appeared to be genuinely surprised and gratified at the wonderful reception2^ 6 ) XU reception accorded tte. in Auw.it. (They had been invited to a auaptuouc bnnquat either by the shaikh, a aenber of the Shaikh* a racily, or by a loading Salr or merchant of the tonn, er.iy night of th. twelve already epent in Swait, let alone luncheon parti** galore;* They took peia* to explain that tfc* braak do«n of Conifer oat ton* Httjst not be ttkan v,o« u. kindly, for the King boro tavalt orery good will, &amp;M they thmaelve* would lo«wo Kuwait, with filings of mendahlp and a&amp;tlsf&amp;otion, and would do thdir best to persuade the King to look upon tho preaent failure, as merely the beginning of future talks to cone. (10) I myself ended the meeting by a short apeeeh, thanking both sides for the good-will, and pleasant temper shown under often trying circumstances ~ it had been a great pleasure to t'x?

(1) I received this morning from the Kuwait Delegates, copies of (a) Letter dated 28th June 1935 from them (Kuwait Delegates) y to the Saudi Delegates, in which they recapitulated all that had passed by letter, between them and the Saudi Delegates. (b) Letter dated 28th June 1935 from the Saudi Delegates in reply to (a) above. (2) Translations of both letters are attached with this and marked and 'G' respectively. (3) As mentioned in para 12 of Notes for Twelfth day (Friday 28th June) the Saudi delegates dined with me on 29th June 1935. The sole other guest was H.E. Shaikh Abdulla al Salim (Deputy Ruler): The dinner passed off very pleasantly and we were all kept amused and interested by Shaikh Khalid ibn al Walid, who with refreshing candour retailed many of his experiences in Italy, Ivioscow, Turkey and Tripoli. (4) Shaikh Khalid apparently tanr went to Moscow on the staff of Earer Pasha, Immediately before the latter’s abortive rebellion and death in Turkestan - He professed to have met Kara Khan Tohioherin, Kalenin and others, (5) Shaikh Khalid talked very cheerfully and freely, . . , otnadv rise of Arab Nationalism in the U) world an^hinted^trongly that H U.

Government would do well tomore free hand where Bahrain, Kuwait and were concerned. (c) of his personal friendship for Philby, who whilst being one of of the greatest and most knowledge- able of Englishmen where matters of Arabia were concerned, yet curiously was one of the most ignorant of all people in that he did not yet understand the of Arab Psychology, and was profoundly ignorant of such things as Arab pride, and Beduin Manners, and Customs. (d) of the late Colonel Lawrence, who he described Vas one of those who had f, luok tt among many other equally good maa and should be called the 'Romancer in chief of the Great War', (e) of Imam Yahya, who nas deeply and genuinely religious, and who he absolved of all connection with the recent attempt to assasinate Bin Baud - but not so his son. ^— (f) of Arabs generally who ban he divided into - ^ the really educated, the half educated and the the Bedouin . He said •&amp;&amp;* the first and last category were about equal in nobility of thought and actions, and that their friendship was really worth cultivating by H.M. Government and English men in general. The Half educated were 'bad to the core', especially the present generation. Their children would be different and better. (g) of the difference between English, French,German, and Turkish philosophy and Psychology - That the rt A' to 'Z' of being a good ruler and good administrator was to study and study again the Psychology of the people one ruled. (6) Before leaving my home Shaikh iQjalid stated that he and his friends departure for Riyath migit be delayed somewhat, owing to the non-arrlTal of spare parts and tyers for their cars from Baghdad. These had be® wired for as Basra could not produce them.After compliments, With reference to the information you imparted to us in today f s meeting, that His Majesty the King would not agree to the resumption of trade between Kuwait and the Sa’udi Arabia, save on the w guarGntee w basis on the part of the Kuwait Government. As you }cnow t we have written a letter to you, d views we considered good for both countries. On the other hand, in the meeting of the 21rt inst (22.6.35) you demanded a 'guarantee', and we stated in our letter of the 24th inst (25.6.35) that that 'guarantee' was impossible to give, as it could not practically or theoretically be enforced. In a second letter, also dated the 24th inst(25.6.35), we asked you to submit both your proposition of 'guarantee' end our reply to it, to His Majesty the King. If His Majesty the King, as you informed us definite ly and verbally today was the case, does not agree to anything but that we give the 'guarantee' asked for, then all that is left for us is to make it known that we cannot commit our selves to any such 'guarantee'. Although we recognize that His Majesty the King and His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir are as brothers, and that there is no difference between our two countries and the two peoples, neverthless we regret the failure of negotiations We do not entirely despair, however, and still hope for agree ment.
