IBy bag. Confidential . (158/6/48). j 17325. b Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. 30th September, 1948. Will you please refer to my letter No. 139 of 26th August ? , . 2. The Government of Pakistan sent us a replace ment for the permanent incumbent of the post of Indian Assistant who while here caused a considerable stir in his endeavour to champion Pakistan against Indian interests in Bahrain. His name was Isharat Hussain. 3. He proceeded to Pakistan in quest of permanent employment, and I have asked that he should not be allowed to return to the Gulf. Immediately on his arrival in Pakistan, and before my above quoted action, vituperous articles appeared in the Pakistan newspaper ’’DAWN 1 ’ attacking Pelly in particular and Bahrain administrative arrangements in general. There is paactically little room for doubt that the articles were inspired by Isharat Hussain. I have no doubt that this man acted without the knowledge of his own Government and, if you have no objection, I should like to take the matter up with the Pakistan Government in ours as well as their interests. * bgd.
