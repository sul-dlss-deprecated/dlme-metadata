Book* C o Pi . Air Communications in the Persian Gulf. {Communicated by the Air Ministry.) r. l-mj The necessity for an organised air route for British aircraft, both Service and Civil, to connect Egypt and Iraq with India, has long been realised ; and the negotiations and technical preparations necessary to this end have been proceeding ever since the end of the Great War, though not without numerous difficulties and delays. It is practicable to organise an air route along either shore of the Gulf. The route along the Persian shore is the better, since the Arabian shore route includes an oversea flight of some 22b miles. The latter route also entails the use of landing grounds on the Hasa and Trucial coasts, and on this account, under the conditions obtaining at the present time, would afford less security for passengers and aircraft than the Persian route. These conditions, however, may be expected to improve. Though the Persian route is the better for a regular civil passenger air service, the Arabian shore route, whether ultimately used as a civil air route or not, is required as a strategic air route for Service aircraft which might be unable by reason of Persian neutrality to use the Persian route. The history of the development of these two routes is related in the following paragraphs. A map of the routes is attached. The Air Route along the Persian Shore. Flights along the route. 1 he first flight between Iraq and India along this route took place in December 1918, and was carried out by a Service aircraft of the Royal Air Force. The Persian Government had at that time little control of their coast line, and the question of obtaining permission for the flight did not then arise. The landing grounds which were required for this flight, were prepared by Royal Air Force personnel, and are those which have been used up to the present time (19281. This route was followed in 1919 by the pioneer long-distance flights to the East, and in 1920 a Flight of Royal Air Force aircraft from Iraq was based at Bushire to assist the British Resident in the maintenance of order. This Flight was withdrawn in the autumn of 1921 when it became necessary to concentrate all available aircraft in Iraq. Since that date the air route along the Persian shore has been used at irregular intervals by both British and foreign aircraft. Several flights have been carried out by Service aircraft of the Royal Air Force, but most of the flights have been by civil aircraft. The Association of the Government of India with the route. the following extracts from the memorandum by the Indian Air Board, prepared in 1926, entitled “ The Past History and Future Development of Civil Aviation in India, describe the association of the Indian Government with the Persian route along the Gulf :— The question of linking India with the outer world by a line of air communications was first raised in June 1919, when a scheme was put forward by the Air Ministry for the establishment of an air service between Cairo and Karachi. Fhe objects of this scheme were mainly military, though the carriage of mails was also contemplated. The Government of’ India siq ported the proposals, and, on the understanding that a weekly service would be instituted, agreed to provide and maintain the necessary aerodromes and buildings from Karachi to Bushire, at an estimated cost of Rs. 13^ lakhs initial and Rs. 36,000 recurring, d lie British Government were to be responsible for providing 5 the necessary machines, the pay and maintenance of the unit, the cost of flying and any other liabilities. It was considered at the time that Karachi must eventually be the aerial gateway of India, and it was realised that, even should the proposed service not be a success, Government would have a permanent asset in the aerodromes and buildings there, upon which it was anticipated that some 80 per cent, of their contribution would be spent. 3133 25 9.28“ Before, however, any action was taken in the matter, the British Government decided to abandon the proposal for the carriage of mails by the suggested service. It would, they decided, be preferable to deal with the scheme as a military proposition, pure and simple, leaving the question of the inauguration of a civil mail service for separate consideration. As it had, in the meantime, been decided independently, as part of the Royal Air Force organisation, to establish an aircraft depot at Karachi, the only extra expenditure involved in the proposal in which, on the analogy of the previous arrangements, India was interested, was that to be incurred at Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and Charbar, estimated, on the reduced scale possible owing to the less ambitious nature of the scheme, to cost about Rs. 1 lakh. The Government of India agreed, as with other similar charges in Persia, to bear half this expenditure. But the military service has never, in fact, been extended to India ; it has been confined to the section Cairo-Baghdad, and consequently the anticipated expenditure upon the Persian Gulf aerodromes has not been incurred. “The proposed civil mail service over the route was the subject of discussion between the British and Indian Governments in 1920, and the latter, although they were, in the conditions then obtaining, somewhat sceptical of its prospects of success, declared themselves ready, if the scheme matured, to adhere to the undertaking which they had given in the previous year, which involved their bearing the whole cost of the depot at Karachi and half that of the three principal aerodromes in the Persian Gulf. They also offered to guarantee a sum of Rs. 1 lakh per annum for three years towards the deficit in the working of the mail service. This offer was, however, never accepted, as, owing to unsettled conditions in Arabia and Mesopotamia, the whole proposal was dropped. It was, however, realised that, even in the absence of such a service, India had a genuine interest in the upkeep of a connecting link, for use when necessary, between the Middle East and Karachi, and in 1921 Government agreed and have continued to make a small contribution to the maintenance of the aerodromes at Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and Charbar, equivalent to half the actual expenditure upon them, limited to £850 for capital and .£100 for annual recurring charges. This, together with a similar contribution from the British Government, has sufficed for the provision of absolutely essential facilities in the shape of go-downs, &amp;c., for the repairs periodically required, and for the pay of the necessary watch and ward establishment.” The attitude of Persia towards the use of the route by a regular Civil Air Service. Persia adhered to the International Convention for Air Navigation in 1920, the Persian Minister in Paris being instructed by his Government to notify the Government of the French Republic of the adherence, at the same time stating that the Persian Government “reserves the right to prepare as and when it becomes possible the means and the new organisations which the execution of the clauses of the said Convention necessitate.” Although the Mejlis has, however, never officially ratified this adherence, Persia has sent official representatives to many of the meetings of the International Commission for Air Navigation and has paid almost up-to-date her contributions towards the expenses of the Commission.' Consequently, there would appear to be no doubt that Persia is in fact a party to the International Air Convention of 1919. Persia, however, has done little towards taking steps to give effect to her adherence to the Convention either in the direction of ground organisation or of air regulations. However, in connection with the fulfilment of her obligations she proceeded to give general notification of certain routes through her territory along which flying could take place. At our request the route along the Persian shore of the Gulf was included in the possible routes. Objection has never been taken by Persia to individual flights of civil aircraft over her territory, but she has taken exception to the operation by Imperial Airways, Limited, of a regular service along the Persian Gulf, though at a later date she offered to allow the operation of a service along one of the other notified routes through Central Persia. During 1925 a fortnightly civil air service between Cairo and Karachi, to be operated by Imperial Airways, Limited, was projected. The use. for this service, of a route through Central Persia was considered, but owing to the difficulty and expense of supplying landing grounds with fuel and stores this route was not consideredpracticable. Negotiations were opened with the Persian Government, who agreed that representatives of the Air Ministry and of Imperial Airways, Limited, should fly along the Gulf in a service aircraft ot the Loyal Air Force to investigate local conditions. This reconnaissance was carried out in the autumn of 192b, and in September of that year Air Vice-Marshal Sir Sefton Brancker, the Director of Civil Aviation, visited Tehran with a view to assisting the British Minister, Sir Percy Loraine, in arranging an agreement for the service with the Persian Government. A satisfactory agreement was concluded in less than a week, largely owing to the cordial relations existing between Riza Khan (then Prime Minister of Persia) and Sir Percy Loraine. The Persian representatives reaffirmed their desire to conform to the terms of the International Air Convention. They were very definite in their view that the ground organisation of the route must be Persian, but indicated that it was impossible for Persia to contribute towards the cost of it. Notes were exchanged in which it was agreed (subject to ratification by the Mejlis of the International Air Convention) to allow Imperial Airways, Limited, to operate a fortnightly service, the British Government undertaking to provide any sheds, buildings and wireless equipment necessary. These items were to become Persian property when completed, with the exception of the wireless equipment, which was to be sold to Persia on a basis of periodic payments. It was indicated during these negotiations that the Persians were ready within their limitations to give effect to their obligations under the Convention to afford liberty of innocent passage across their territory and to provide facilities therefor. The ratification by the Mejlis of the Convention, however, was deferred through 1926 in spite of the endeavours of the British Minister, and this fact was used as a pretext for withholding permission for the operation of the service by Imperial Airways between Basrah and Karachi. Meanwhile, work on the organisation of the route began ; measures were taken for the erection of huts and the installation of petrol tanks; and wireless equipment was delivered. In December 1926 the Persian Government gave orders that work on the ground organisation of the route must cease and that the service could not be permitted. In January 1927 Air Vice-Marshal Sir Sefton Brancker again visited Tehran, where Sir Robert Clive had just arrived as British Minister. Conferences were held and promises were made that the Convention would be ratified at an early date. Subsequently, however, it became clear that the Persian Government had in fact at that time no intention of carrying out their agreement. It would appear that their attitute was due to three reasons :— (i) The route would be of no great value to Persia herself. (ii) The Persian Government did not wish the route to be administered by foreigners and feared the responsibility and cost of administering it themselves. (iii) 'The Persian Government were afraid that the regular operation of a British civil air service would increase British influence in the Persian Gulf. The discussion reached a deadlock, which persisted until it became possible to bring pressure to bear on the Persians to reopen the negotiations under the terms of the new treaty with Persia concluded in the spring of the present year (1928). Following on a visit to Tehran by the General Manager of Imperial Airways, Limited, in June 1928, the Persian Government has agreed to allow the Company as from January 1929 to operate a limited service along the route, using only Bushire and Jask as aerodromes and Lengeh as an emergency landing ground. The Persian Government have said, categorically, that permission will not be renewed after a period of three years has expired, which in their opinion should allow the Company time to study the possibilities of operating a Central Persian route through Tehran, the route which they wish followed. The Persian Government also insist on retaining the ground organisation for the three years’ service along the Persian Gulf in their own hands, including the provision of petrol installations and the provision and operation of the wireless service. This offer, which has several very undesirable restrictions attaching to it, is now receiving the consideration of the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways, Limited. The Air Route along the Arabian Shore. It is desired for this air route to establish refuelling grounds at intervals of about 200 miles and emergency landing grounds at intervals of 30-50 miles. It would notbe necessary normally for aircraft to refuel at all these landing grounds, but at certain times of year strong adverse winds are encountered in these regions and may make an intermediate landing necessary lor luel. The route is described below by sections. At the present time flights have only been made over the Kuwait and Ilasa sections between Iraq and Bahrein. These sections have not yet been reconnoitred on the ground, and the ground reconnaissance of several of the other sections has not yet been completed. Kuwait Section.—Kuwait lias been visited by Royal Air Force service aircraft at intervals since 1920, and a landing ground near the town is in existence. In 1920 the Shaikh of Kuwait asked for help in the defence of his territory against the Akhwan. Two aircraft were accordingly despatched to drop leaflets on the Akhwan, warning them that offensive action would be taken against them if they made any attempt to attack the town. This had the desired effect. In 1924, when a Royal Air Force aircraft returning from a flight to Bahrein had made a forced landing some distance away on the Kuwait coastline, the Shaikh lent his own cars and staff to go out to its relief. In the present year (1928;, the Shaikh of Kuwait again asked for our assistance against a threatened Akhwan attack, and a flight of aircraft and section of armoured cars were sent to Kuwait. No Akhwan attack, however, was made. Hasa Section.—The reconnaissance of the llasa coast section has had to be postponed again and again owing to difficulty in obtaining sanction from Ibn Saud. One refuelling ground in the neighbourhood of Ras-as-Safaniyah and two emergency landing grounds are required. In order that our request might be presented in the most favourable light, the opportunity was awaited of the visit of Sir Gilbert Clayton to Ibn Saud in May 1927. In reply to our request to carry out the reconnaissance, Ibn Saud asked for more complete information, and it was explained to him through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah that we required to make a reconnaissance, on the ground only, for the purpose of selecting sites for landing grounds, and that aircraft would not use these landing grounds until his agreement had been obtained. Delay ensued, however, in view of the wish expressed by Ibn Saud to send a representative to Hasa to ascertain the local conditions before acceding to our request. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah was of the opinion that at this time Jbn Saud was not unfavourably disposed towards the project for an air route ; but was actuated by genuine anxiety for the safety of the reconnaissance party in Hasa. Four months later, in September 1927, a reply was received from Ibn Saud to the effect that he could not sanction the reconnaissance owing to the attitude of the Hasa tribes, whose suspicions had been aroused by the establishment of military posts in the southern desert of Iraq. Thereafter, it was the intention that the British Resident, Bushire, should endeavour to obtain permission, and he was instructed to raise the question on the occasion of his projected interview with Ibn Saud in regard to the Akhwan raid on Busaiyah police post in Iraq in November 1927. This interview, however, did not take place. Since that date the Akhwan situation has prevented any further representations being- made to Ibn Saud ; and no favourable opportunity occurred for the reopening of the subject during the recent conversations in dune 1928 between Sir Gilbert Clayton and Ibn Saud. Bahrein.—No flights were made to Bahrein prior to 192-1. Early in that year, in. view of the interest aroused locally by the purchase of some foreign aircraft by the Persian Government, the British Resident at Bahrein requested that a flight of service aircraft should visit the island for the purpose of “ showing the flag.” A Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance party was sent to the island and a landing ground selected, and in May 1924 a flight of Royal Air Force service aircraft flew from Iraq to Bahrein and made several flights over the island. Sheikh Mahommed of Bahrein was flown and the visit of the aircraft met with a most friendly reception. Ibn Saud objected to this flight on the ground that it caused consternation among iiis subjects. A reply was sent to the effect that the aircraft did not fly over his territory, but along the coastline, that being the most direct route between Kuwait and Bahrein. No further flights over these sections were made until 1927, when the journey was twice flown by civil aircraft of Imperial Airways, Limited. On the first of these occasions a Shaikh Abdul Rahman Qasaibi, who had represented himself as being oneof the principal advisers to Ibn Sand, was carried. It transpired later, however, that this Shaikh had formed an exaggerated view of his own position, and that in giving permission for the flight he had acted without authority. On the occasion of the second flight permission was not sought and the aircraft flew a course outside territorial waters. At about this time (August 1927) enquiries were made of Imperial Airways, Limited, with a view to the operation of a fortnightly flight from Bahrein to Basrah for the transport of pearls. Although this project was abandoned, it is an indication of one of the uses which a civil air route down the Arabian shore could serve. Summary.—As regards the sections between Iraq and Bahrein the present position is therefore that one refuelling ground and two emergency landing grounds have still to be selected before this part of the route can be regarded as fully satisfactory ; and arrangements have still to be concluded with Ibn Sand for the carrying out of this reconnaissance, and for the use of the route. Aircraft, however, have already flown between Koweit and Bahrein without requiring to make an intermediate landing. Sections from Bahrein to Muscat.—In March 1927 an Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance party visited these sections. All the sites required for refuelling grounds were reconnoitred and selected. That is to say, Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, A1 Auhi and Muscat. Of the emergency grounds required, however, it was only possible, owing to the attitude of the minor Shaikhs, to select definitely those in the Batina section (towards Muscat). Attitude of the minor Shaikhs.—The Shaikhs whose authority lies mainly on the coastline and does not extend inland, e.g. the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and those in the Batina section, which includes A1 Auhi, are under British influence and are at the mercy of any action we might take from the sea. The few inhabitants of Yas Island were also found friendly, and no difficulty, therefore, should arise in establishing the landing grounds required at Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, and in the Batina section. The attitude of the Sultan of Muscat has throughout been most friendly. The Shaikhs, however, whose territory extends further inland are naturally more at the mercy of Ibn Sand and hdVe accepted Wahabism to a greater extent. Thus, the Shaikh of Qatar was opposed to the establishment of a landing ground in his territory, stating to the reconnaissance party that it would place him in great difficulty with the subjects of Ibn Saud, who visited his port in considerable numbers. In regard to his objection, however, it was observed by the British Resident at Bushire that these difficulties might not be found to be insuperable, but might be surmounted by a financial arrangement. The Barianii Shaikh (Oman section) definitely barred the progress of the reconnaissance party, stating that the country belonged to Ibn Saud; and in spite of every effort by the British Wazir of Muscat who accompanied the party, refused to grant permission to proceed and obliged the party to turn northward out of Ids country to Sharjah. Summary.—On these sections, therefore, between Bahrein and Muscat, the present position (1928) is that the refuelling grounds required have been reconnoitred but the intermediate emergency landing grounds have for the most part not yet been reconnoitred ; and it is necessary to arrange for the completion of the reconnaissance and the use of the route. Baluchistan Section.—From Muscat this route leaves the Arabian shore and crosses by a sea flight of 22G miles to the Baluchistan coast at Gwadar. No difficulties are anticipated in regard to facilities on the Baluchistan section. The Government of India have already agreed to provide a landing ground near Pasni.
