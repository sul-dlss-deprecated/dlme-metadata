As I was unable to m&amp;Ke any progress, however, I passed on the ’Ku ait Government's 1 (sic) reply in my Pdcpress Letter No.841 of the 20th November. 4. On the 7th December, however, Aitbar Lari's clerK came here and, on his application, the Director of Customs Innocently gave him the usual landing certificate to the effect that the tea hud ben landed here. The clerK brought the certificate to me for countersignature, and 1 tooK a copy of it. b. The tea had actually been taAen over by His Hi hness' Secretary himoclf. I nave again spoken and written to the Kuwait Government on the subject and received only evasive replies. As far as I con see the tea has been smuggled into Iraq, probably to Yousuf Ezra's agent in Basrah. 0. The Kuwait Government’s official explanation is given in paragraph 3 of my letter under reference. I doubt if it is wholly true, however, because — unliice the Export Trade Controller, Bombay, in respect of piece-goods — the Tea Controller for India really does try to control tea exports; end insists on the production by every shipper of customs lending certificates from m nifosted destinations. Diverted consignments arc deducted from the quota of the territory receiving them. The fee Gontroller has already made claims against Kuwait's quote on these grounds, and, hud Kuwait’s quota really been diverted, he would probably have informed me of credits as well as deductions. 7. I am replying to the Tea Jontroller for India separately on tlie subject oi these deductions, tnd I shall send you a copy. I merely mention this case as an instance, of the evils arising out of Ills Highness' tryin : to run his government on e no-cot basic by employing a merchant as secretary end paying him in trade privileges rather than in cash. This case is in interesting example of His Highness*?bciGSX5r ad - y Erf-ract of notia^ dated the 8 th February, 1945 made -r on 0 / 5 * 7 * &gt; 'nV^O ; X ' T : .'I i 'II «T &gt; Ivlr. d. N. Jackeorio by '(D 'OW This letter addressed to me, ostersibly by His ifec Highness, instead of the usual letter from His Highness forwarding the remarks of the Head of the Rationing Committee as at page 4, is the result of a struggle between Abdulla Mulla - a merchant himself and very much interested - and Abdulla Salim, in which Abdulla Mulla was able to get His Highness to side with him. The reason is not far to seek. His Highness employs Abdulla Mulla as his Secretary without paying him any salary. Abdulla Hulla is expected • to work and to maintain a staff of clerks for no cash remuneration. His remuneration is made in the form of trade privileges and political employment - as laboufc adviser - with the oil and sulphur companies for which, at His Highness insistence, he gets considerable salaries. This is just one illustration of the evils of a system of Government run on a no-cost basis. Unless the P.A. insists there will be no control of prices. I have arranged with Abdulla Salim, however, that the Cloth Corporation shall import all the requirements of cloth for rationed distribution so that such essentials as chafias and mosquito netting will be available at controlled prices. Please see also in this connection my letter at page 2 of File 27/88. The only Import Assistance Recommendations thfct will be given for cloth to other merchants for the second half of 1945 will be to enable them to clear orders already placed and paid for. On further consideration I am now opposed to trying to con- / _ trol the prices of other goods from the United Kingdom. I think is a better policy to try to get more goods. For thas purpose I have asked for 100 tons instead of 50 for July - December 1945. Bahrain whose population is about the same as Kuwait’s, has 400 tons. The disparity i*s quite unjustifiable, as this tonnage is for goods otner thanthose required by Oil Companies. That they have too great a tonnage at their disposal is obvious from the non-essentials for which Import ± ... r Assistance Recomnendations are-given.
