C0-1-1033.The Revet Mr.H zf th' Arabia^ Mission wrote to Mrs.Loch on the 20th January 1933 saying that they were at celebrating Holy Communion ifiar a service at 5 p.m on the 22nd January to which we were cordially invited and also saying that there were services every Suncta v at 2 . I was a little dubious as to what extent it was desir^KLe for the Political Ag.rt to attend the Mission services,but we decided to do so on this occasion. 3. It was noticeable in the service evidently as a gesture of good-will^ the Minister prayed for Ling George and the Royal Family and so on at considerable length,before his prayer for the President of the United States. I do not know to what extent,if at all,this is customary. 4. Mr. Ha^'en came up after the service and particularly thanked the r olitical Agent and Mrs. Loch for attending. 5 p.m.On the evening of the 8th February 1983 the Hon f ble the Political Resident,the Political Agent ana Mrs Loch ana the Senior Naval Officer dined with the Adviser and Mrs Belgrave. Mr and Mrs ae Grenier were also asked but were very late for dinner,giving as an excuse that they had been aelayea at a bridge party (actually given at the Aaviser ! s house). it is usual for all guests to be assembled before the IIon T ble the Political Resident arrives,if he dines out, ana this proceaure should be insisted upon. I will take an opportunity of drawing Mr.de arenier f s attention to the matter. /]?(? On the evening ox uie ord March Haji Williamson dined quietly at the Agency. He was staying at tne nouse of Khan Sahib Yusif oin Ahmad Kanoo. At some point in tne conversation,after dinner,he took tne opportunity of mentioning that Yusif Kanoo f s mother would ruie to see Mrs.Loch and enquired wnether Mrs.Loch would liice to see ner at the Agency or whether she would prefer to nave an invitation to their nouse. I said that it was a thing whicn nao not oeen done uefore and tnat I should liice to thin*, it over and that I thought that there were a certain amount of diificuities in sucn matters,oecause,if it was done lor one person it would nave to oe none lor many persons unless ill feeling was to ue caused. I asiced Haji Williamson shftttfc-nis opinion and ne said tnat it might give rise to aitiicultiesiand said that ne naa oeen given the message and so nad delivered it. I gathered irom ms way of giving tne message tnat he was rather doubtful about it and tnat ne reany tnougnt tnat it was not a very sound I have ret tne matter drop and m any case it would be unwise to meet the wives (or mothers} 01 mercnants before tne wives of a numuer of tne Al Khaliiah. o-o-iThe Political Agent and Mrs.Loch arrived at Bushire on the evening of the 14th March 1933 and stayed till the morning of the 19th March. 2. On the 16th March the Political Resident (Lieut Colonel T.C.W.Fowle) took the Political Agent (Lieut Colonel Gordon Loch) to pay an informal visit on His Excellency the Governor, who received them at his rooms in the Government offices in Bushire. The dress was mufti,lounge suits,and His Excellency the Governor was similiarly attired. Tea,coffee,biscuits and sweetmeats were provided. His Excellency the Governor was very pleasant and asked a number of questions of common interest about Bahrain. \ 3. On the 18th March His Excellency the Governor returned the visit at the Residency at Sabzabad. 4. Sir Aurel Stein was staying at the Residency. He had just made the journey along the coast from (I think) Bandar Abbas to Asalu. He was much struck with the poverty and lack of animals^ /^including donkeys for transport^ due to the two years of bad famine. He mentioned that people all along the coast had referred to Bahrain as being the best place in the Persian Gulf with good Government etcetera.came On the ^Dth. March Haji Abdul Nabi Bushin to see me. He said tnat in the past ms name nad oeen on the list ui those on v/hom the Political Agent paid. Id calls,but that lor some reason calls nad not oeen paid lor some time. I said that I nad no miorelation on the subject out would make enquiries. He explained at some length that ne xept aloof Irom intrigue etcetera and was a well wisher of tne British Government. I examined the list of callers ana iind tnat m Colonel Barrett’s time Haji Abdul Nabi Bushin’s and several other names were removed from the nst. I do not know whether this was aone lor any particular reason or merely Decause the calling list nad oecome unwieldy. In any case I have notea on the appropriate file that I am not prepared to add names to this list.( 24 ) the Agency at which His Excellency the Naval Commanaer-in- Chief (Vice Admiral M.E.Dunbar-Nasmith),Mrs.Dunbar-Nasmith, the Senior Naval Gflicer in the Persian G-ull' (Captain J.V. Creagh),the Flag Captain (Captain T.S.V.Phillips),the Naval Commander-in-Chiet’^.s Secretary (Paymaster Commander J.Dent), ^His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa Al Khalilah,Shaikh Muhammad bin ’Isa Al Khalifah and Mr. ana Mrs.Belgrave were present. Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman were invited but were aiway on the mainland. 2. The Table plan and menu is attached. 3. Mess dress white was worn. 4. Before dinner discreet enquiries were made as to whether His Excellency Shaikh Hamad would object to the Europeans present having ordinary drinks. It was put to His Excellency that our custom was to toast the King in wine but that the King had Himself given permission that in the event of people not wishing to use wine the Toast might be honoured in water. It was emphasised that none of us would have the slightest objection to the meal being a teetotal one if His Excellency and Shaikh Muhammad had any feeling in the matter. Neither of them nad the slightest objection,it oeing,of course,understood that they would not drink themselves. Care was taken that the wine was carried round and not p assed round the table, b. It was arranged that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad should give the Toast of the King and that His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief should propose that of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad. This arrangement was decided on in order to emphasise the British protection over Bahrain. In Muscat the circumstances ( are uiilerent. His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief proposes the Sultan’s health and the Sultan replies by proposing the King’s health. In the case of Bahrain it seems desirable to emphasise the British protection so it seemed more appropriate that the Ruler should propose the King’s health first. 6 . Belore dinner sherry and soft drinks for the Shaikhs was ( 2 )2 ptfUcH, / served. After dinner there was s short cinema show and then coffee was served but not tib. V. On the evening of the 8th November 1933 the same party dined ■«* the 'Hawkins' ana the same proceaure regaramg toasts was followed. After the toasts His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief presentea to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin T Isa Al Khalifah a silver bas^-relief of the 'Hawkins' on a black wood base as a momento of tne visit. 8 . After dinner there was a short conjuring entertainment after which His Excellency Shaikh Hamad took his leave. 9. In the^afternoon at 13.00 hours on the 9th November 1933 His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin f Isa Al Khalifah gave a lunch to the same guests at MUHARRAQ. 10. Dress ordinary mufti suits. 11. It should be noted on future occasions tnat if Sis Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief wishes to proceed direct to MUHARRAQ and not via the Customs Pier a reliable pilot should be sent to pilot his motor boat in. Tne barge draws too much water. /j On doth occasions H.E. the Naval Commander-in-Chief proposed ■ ~ ^ter + ^ health while we were s1 drinking 10-11-1933Note re: 'Grace' . At the dinner to the European community on the night oi' the 9/10th November 1933 tne question arose as to whether f grace f should be said by one of the Ministers ol tne American Mission. As,however,they have no ecclesiastical jurisdiction m Bahrain or in His Majesty f s Ships,it was decided that His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief should himself say f grace f . He gave Nelson’s ’grace’ which runs:- 2. This procedure should be brought to the notice of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the event of another dinner to the Community on board the Flag-ship.Just a line to thank you very much for your kind note of greetings for Christmas and the New Tear and for so kindly sending us such delicious fruit. Yours sincerely, • &gt; Khan Sahib laauf bin ahmed Kanoo, C. I . Bahrain.At Christmas 1933 the question arose of the Christmas entertainments. It was suggested that mrs.Belgrave ana Mrs. Skinner should combine to give a Christmas dinner. In previous years (1932; we had arranged with Mr.and Mrs.Belgrave that they should take the Christmas dinner as Hogmanay is a peculiarly Scottish institution and we did not keep Christmas in the same way as it is kept in England. This year,however,Hogmanay fell on Sunday so that it 'would have been difficult to ask,for example,Members of the Mission. Christmas has always been the occasion for a dinner in the Agency and it did not seem appropriate that the custom should give way to the combined function though there 'was no objection to the Adviser giving one by himself. In all the circumstances I decided to resume the custom of giving a Christmas dinner and the Agency as my successor might well prefer that day rather than Hogmanay. Mrs. Belgrave and Mrs.Skinner are giving a dinner on the 2nd January 1934 which is to count as a New Year dinner. i propose in future years to keep the Christmas day dinner as essentially an Agency affair. The question has arisen of the limitation of parties owing to the growing size of the community and it will probably be an acute question next year. The size of the Agency dining room precludes asking the whole community so I have got over the difficulty by using the verandah. On the King’s Birthday it is the hot weather so that a number of the community are usually away, a possible method of dealing with the situation is to have parties for representatives of different branches of activity,for example,one oil,one bank,one commerce,one mission or something of this kind. Inother question connected with this is the habit of borrowing crockey,glass and cutlery, i have definitely refused to lend my personal stuff,particularly cutlery which is old family stuff but there is a certain amount of other crockeyy which has been left by successive Political Agents ana I nave on accasions lent this. It is,however,now generally accepted tnat the Agency does not lena out household goods. There has(&amp; z? to be some give and take in a rather out of the way place like Bahrain but in general terms those who have not got the necessary crockery should not give parties. 31-12-1933.November 11th,1933. My dear Belgrave, I enclose the Card of invitation to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad’s luncheon on the 9th November 1933 as the title 'The Honourable’’ has been left out before the Political Resident’s name. 2 . I am sure that it was a slip but I think you would lile to put it right in the future. Yours sincerely,3 *- On Thursday 18th January 1334 I went to call on the family of Shaikh Muhammad bin ’Isa al Khalifa, on the occasion of the 'Id. My' Husband was calling on /L. UZc / Shaikh Aabdulla bin ’Isa al Khalifa and mane a ■request to £0 and see the family of his brother (who was absent in Tyypt). I drove to tne house and was re ceived by the wife of the Shaikh whose name is Sarah. She greeted me and showed me in to a room where were a larje numbed £f children of all ajes and five or six women and her daughter Hisseh, who is married to a son of Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa al Khalifa.. I told then how I came to Bahrain by aeroplane, and how I had left my son with my people in Scotland. They showed me a photograph of Shaikh Muhammad and toll m they had had letters from him in Bjypt by air mail. They jave me a meal of fruit, peeled two bananas for me and handed me handfuls of pome- pranite ; we ate Turkish deli put too and some ice wafers. After some delay, coffee was handed round and then rose water and smoke. I had explained I was in rather a hurry to rejoin my Husband - indeed a messenger had already cone twice to say he was waiting for me at the pier and the tide was going down.33 Cn Thursday 18th January 1334 1 went to call on the family of Shaikh Abdulla bin ’Isa al Khalifa, on the occasion of the ’Id. My Husband was calling / on the Shaikh and made a request for me to yo and see his family if convenient j accordingly I drove to his house. The lady met me near the women's entrance, received me with the usual Arab greetings and brought me in to her sitting room, which is also her bedroom. He talked about Bahrain and she told me about her visit to England and Scotland and I found I understood her easily. He saw her black rabbit and her pigeons and several dogs belonging to Shaikn Abdulla. I was given fruit to eat and she peeled an orange for me and handed it to rtie. After about SO minutes she called for coffee - then for rose water and sr.\oke and I took ray leave. tPlease tell Haji Yusuf Kanoo that Mrs.Loch would like to pay an 1 Id visit of congratulations on his family at 10.00 on Saturday-2Oth January. No interpreter is necessary. Is it convenient at tnat time ? G.L. 20.1.34 H.M. P . A . As ordered above I informed K.S.Yusuf Kami. He asJced me to convey his respects to you and to say that nis family will be delighted to receive Mrs.Loch at the time fixed. I went to pay this call on the family, on Saturday 20th January, arriving just after 10 o'clock. K.S. Yusuf Kanu saw the car and walked up the street after it, so that, when I had turned the corner to his doorway, he was there and he opened my door and greeted me in the usual Arabic phrases $ he then led me upstairs where his wife was awaiting me ; we went into the sitting room and K.S.Yusuf Kanu left us. After some minutes' con versation about health, weather and my learning Arabic, we were joined by the mother of K.S.Yusuf Kano, another of his family, three other ladies and five or six children. I was jiven fruit to eat, with plateand spoon - but the ladies were fasting. After twenty minutes' talk about Bahrain and England and about my son in Scotland, coffee was served ; after that rose water and smoke. I took my leave of the ladies and then my hostess took me to her bedroom where she gave me as a present a box of scent and soa&gt;, atthe same time scenting me round my neck from her own scent bottle. Again I took leave, and allthe ladies saw me off from the top of their stair. v£&gt;.u**a*v h.v/3 ^ ( 4 # On Monday 22nd January, the wife of Shaikh Abdulla bin ’Isa al Khalifa came to call, from Muharraq - the tide being suitable for the Agency pier at a.30 in the morning. She was attended by two female servants and accompanied in the launch and along the pier by a man who waited for her downstairs. I met her at the top of the stairs and welcomed her and brought her into the drawing room. gh talked about my photographs of my home and my son and my family - about my cinema - and about the garden, and various things. he ate some eclairs and sore biscuits were ready. I rang for coffee and we drank that, then when she made a move to go I rang for av/ud and tib. I saw her off from the verandah &amp;t the ton of the stairs, and she and her v/omen went off to the pier to join the launch. The visit lasted about an hour. * 2 ? ‘if4 hie.

Apart from any question of consulting me beforehand, tne first news I got of Busk (wnose name i only knew by chance) was the telegram about his being on board,which only reached me curing dinner the night before his arrival,although I gather that ins tour m the Gulf nan been tne subject of discussion ior some weeks and tnat his actual passage to Bahrain had been arranged at least a day or so beiore the snip started. Busk himself certainly seemed under the impression that I had known for some time of his coming. 4.

LOOKING at LIFE ■ t Northclifje House T O be in vited to t e;*t with the ShSLka of Bahrein and, be cause that lady keeps strict pur dah, to be asked to bring not her husband but—his photograph! Such was the a m using experi ence of Lady B o w y er-Smyth, who has Just re turned from a visit to her hus band, Commander Sir Philip Bowyer- Smyth, on the Per sian Gulf. “ The She ika was a strikingly beautiful woman in her richly coloured burnous,” Lady Bowyer- Smyth told me when I met her at a luncheon party, “ and her lovely hands were exqui sitely ‘ made up ’ for the occasion, with vivid scarlet nails and carefully henna’ed palms. “ We drank tea and ate a bewilder ing varied- of dates and sweetmeats. Then we-''ire offered a bitter-tasting coffee—and it was not until my cup had been filled up three times bya slav^ that I became alive to the only polite way of refusing more—to shake my cup from side to side! ” WOMEN in purdah are not so narrow in their outlook as many people here seem to think. It app ts that the Sheika discussed European affairs far more intelligently than many women who rejoice in their “ freedom.” Lady Bowyer-Smyth flew to the East by way of Basra, a journey of just over three days. And although she met with a severe buffeting on the way back she enjoyed every minute of her air trip. * * * Feminine Types and Styles at the “Magnolia Street” first night. v of York’s London house, so mothers will be interested to know that the young Princesses’ summer wardrobes are nov 7 being planned.

In their fifth report, issued yes terday, the commissioners state that it has become increasingly evident that the regulc/.ions are no longer effective in safeguarding the national or piiblic amenities of the metropolis. Similar conditions are developing in many provincial cities. “ A striking example is provided by the relation of recently erected build ings to St. Paul’s Cathedral. “ The distant views of St. Paul’s provide some of the most famous and beautiful prospects in London, or, indeed, in any other great city. Of these views two, namely, those from Waterloo Bridge and from the Surrey side of Southwark Bridge, have been disastrously blocked by newly erected structures.” There is a growing tendency of building owners to build to the maxi mum height authorised. In London a high building level of approximately 100ft. is already permissible, although the height of old buildings is low.

I think that he was doing this in order to get the cool breeze, as he would ordinarily have met us at the top of the stairs. The Political Agent and the Shaikh sat on a sofa and the Assistant Political Agent on a chair at his right. Shaikh (Abdullah was present. The call lasted about three a ^uarter^ of an hour and the usual courtesies were observed. On leaving the Shaikh shook hands at the top of the stairs. 4.

This form of marking the day has become unsuit- corae from the Jabal in the middle of the hot weather merely to pay a call and also it is unreasonable to interrupt their work. The numbers of the community have moreover so increased to the peculiar constitution of the community, is it possible interests. In the circumstances it was decided that the best course was to give up the morning call and to issue a formal invitation to a reception in the cool of the evening. 2. Invitation cards were obtained from Cartier in a suitable form. The Office should note that an order should be placed next year in plenty of time. This file had better be submitted on the 3rd March. 3. A list of those to whom invitations were sent is placed below. The principle observed has been to invite/ with separate cards all the community in Manamah including married drillers who live in Manamah. Separate invitations were sent to each of the British employees of The Bahrain Petroleum Comp^ay Limited and a single card to the President and members of the BAPCO Club. On this particular occasion a single card of invitation was sent to Captain Smith and Mr. Deacon on which was written ^and staff', so as to give an opportunity for the personnel of the Sub-marine Pipe-line Party to come. Mr. Skinner and Mr. Deacon were asked kindly to let the Political Agent know before hand roughly how many might be expected as the result of the general invitation. able because it is impossible to expect British subjects to that it is impossible to hold a dinner party nor, having regard to give a dinner party to representatives of the various4. Replies were received from all except five of the drillers one of whom apologised for not having replied. Next year it might be well to drop an hint that replies are expected. 5. Papers are placed below showing the drinks etcetera provided. Small tables and chairs were placed on the west broad path of the garden by the wail between the garden and the tennis court. The State Engineer kindly made arrangements for coloured lights to be put up. Lurries were put down and it should be noted that we need a new supply very badly. This point should be extracted and estimates obtained for suitable durries. 6 . The supplies of arinks etcetera were kept behind the well but it would probably be a good thing on another occasion to put tables round the v/ell and to put up a chupper screen behind which the domestic arrangements could be made. 7. Next year it would probably be wise to draw up a rough time table of the order in which refreshments are passeu round, though so far as could be seen the arrangements worked pretty well. 8 . Till the Assistant Political Agent kindly go through the above notes and see if he can suggest any points which might have attention next year. Dictated on 5-6-1934.The attached invitation was for a Fourth of July celebration by the personnel of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Most, if not all, of the Manamah community were present. There were donkey races with a Bookies' box (l), a kind of base ball match and the usual crackers of the Fourth of July. Theresas a barbecue, which is simply meat roasted in a peculiar way over a slow fire. Plates, knives and forks were handed out and everyone qeued up for the eatables. I left after the meal at about 20.30 hours and 1 fancy that most people came away a little later. The Assistant Political Agent also came for a short time but excused himself from the barbecue.

Position as Chief Minister of an Independent state... this is really a fiction as whatever the Agency says goes* and he owed his appointment to the Govt of India and not to the Shaikh. » / / ,f\ r f v n 4. Mrs Belgrave.Confidential November 23rd 1934 My dear Fowle, With reference to our conversations during your recent visit to Bahrain, I write to as* for a ruling regarding the precedence of the Assistant Political Agent and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government 2* The essential point is how the decision will affect the British position in Bahrain* Any analogy with an Indian State would be danger ous , as Bahrain is an independent ShaiiChdom. 3. On the one hand, the Assistant Political Agent has a certain position as a British Government official, he carries on the work when the Political Agent is on tour and his appointment will become more important when and if an oil field is developed in ^atar. Placing him after the Adviser would no doubt be remarked,but I thin* that the prestige of the Agency would carry him with it v/ithout harm to his usefulness. On the other hand, the Adviser is the head official of an independ ent State, but depends to a considerable extent on our backing; and if we diminish his position , there are not lacking people who will make capital out of it by ,for example,pointing out to the Shaikh and others that the country nas been handed over to us and thatve do not show courtesy to him and his Adviser. The Adviser's position would become more difficult in the event of naval developments. 4. If both were relatively new appointments and if the individuals we*;* likely to hold them were of much the same age (and, I assume, social position) , I should have been inclined for various reasons to favour making the Assistant Political Agent senior. We cannot ,however, in the actual circumstances,overlook personal considerations. 5. The Adviser (Mr C.D.Belgrave) is considerably older than an Assistant Political Agent is likely to be and had nine years of British Government service (including war service since 1915) before he came to Banrain,where he nas served for over nine years. He hashad a large share in building up modern Bahrain and has held place second only the Political Agent all the time (except for the Shaiich and his brothers). It would,in my opinion, detract much from his use fulness to us , and maxe his personal position very difficult, if we were to place him below officers far his junior in age and service. 6. I would,therefore, recommend that I should tell the Shaixh verb ally that the matter of precedence has arisen in connection with,for examples,dinners : that as Mr Belgrave has had long service,including War service, under Government and also in Bahrain, we are giving him, as a special case, pride of place after the Political Agent : but that . if in the fulness of time another officer were to succeed him , the matter would be considered again. To Mr Belgrave I would write confidentially and demi-officially to the same effect ,so that the personal nature of the precedence would be on record in the Bahrain Government records as well as ours. I admit that thfcs solution of the problem has its drawbaoxs, but it seems to meet the peculiar circumstances, and in particular , if the precedence is clearly personal from the outset, difficulties over an Assistant to the Adviser when acting for the Adviser may be avoided. 7. It would be prudent to settle the matter before Christmas,which will provide a long scries of test cases and I should lixe to avoid embarrassing situations at a time which is generally regarded as being one of goodwill towards men J Yours sincerely,Confidential . The Residency, Bushire, the 1st December, -.934. oLLAs\. 'ttr? 1 Your letter of November 23rd on the subject of the knotty point of precedence as between the assistant Political regent and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. I agree with you that as long as Belgrave is Adviser he should take precedence over the Assistant Political Agent. In the conversation to which you refer I think v/e agreed that one solution would be that the two officials concerned would take precedence according to their length of service: the Assistant Political agent counting his Civil service under Government and the adviser his service under the Bahrain Government. This solution would ensure that Belgrave took precedence over *Vorthj and I imagine of any Assistant Political Agent likely to be appointed to Bahrain^since Worth has I think more Civil service than most assistant Political Agents would have. Are there objections to this as compared with the procedure suggested in your paragraph 6 ? 3. It should be clearly understood that when the Assistant Political Agent acts/for the Political Agent in the latter’s absence, the assistant political agent would have to take precedence over the adviser and that the Assistant xolitical Agent would always take precedence over the assistant to the adviser even when the Assistant is acting for the adviser. I presume you agree with this. irwv* ' rvVvConfidential. January 4th 1935 My dear Fowle, Will you Kindly refer to your demi-official letter dated the 1st December 1934 aboii the precedence of the Adviser and the Assist ant Political Agent. 2. I have serious doubts about the course suggested in the second paragraph of your letter because it commits us to the next Adviser becoming senior to the Assistant Political Agent ,probably fairly the next Adviser will be a promoted cult to refuse to let him count for precedence his service as Assistant to the Adviser. Possibly his becoming senior to the Assistant political Agent might not matter, but we do not Know who may hold| the post of Adviser,or what form , and I personally would prefer not If the precedence is Kept personal stronger poation to think again then, me , when acting , would have less ace over the Assistant Political soon. It is not improbable that Assistant and it might be diffi the post may take, in the future to commit ourselves in any way. to Belgrave , we shall be in a and his Assistant in the meanti ground for any claim to precede Agent. 3.

All Sloops, as opportunity offered. 4. All married people (vide list at pages 95-8 oT file 3/3-III). 5. President and Members of Bapco Club. I also went to see all the bachelors in Manamah. 2.

Lamb, O.C. visited Bahrain for 3 weeks at the end of July 1935 and early August 1935 by my invitation and the arrangements for his entertainment were made by Mr Skrimshire and me. He stayed with both of us as our guests in turn. Mass is usually offered in Mr I)ias T house and was a few times on this occasion. I offered the Political Agent T s ^ourt as a permanent chapel for Father Lambs’ visit and the offer was eventually accepted. Father Lamb and Mr Lias arranged the Court as a Chapel with a table raised to waist high as altar. I lent my carpets for the dais. Chairs were arranged below the dais with an aisle in the centre. The objection the priest has to using the Agency is that the subordinate employees in Bahrain, a very large number of whom are Catholics would not come to the Agency. On the other hand I pointed out that although Mr Skrimshire and I had no objection to going to Mr Dias’ house for Mass, some members of the Bahrain Petroleum Company had. Due to the fact that I served Mass daily, and people came to know I was a Catholic, the objection to their coming to the Agency was overcome. Cr«A. Cole 12-12-1935. File G.L. 12-12-35NOTE REGARDING THE SEATING OF THE PRINCIPAL GUEST AT A FORMAL DINNER AT THE AGENCY. I. The chief lady sits on the right hand of the Political Agent. Of this there is, of course, no doubt. f. Some doubt has, however, been expressed whether the chief man should sit on the right or on the left of the Hostess. I have always observed the custom of ^lacing the chief man on the left of the Hostess (a) because in taking his Hostess in to dinner he is on her left side, (b) because, if he sits on her right, two ladies will (if numbers are even) sit together, and (c) because with the limited staff available in an Agency, if the chief man sits on the right of the Hostess, it would make him the last to be served. Zm In view of the doubt whether the procedure in para- graph ( 2 ) was correct on an official occasion, I v/rote to one of the Gentleman Ushers of His Majesty 1 * Household and asked him to obtain a reply to the following question:- 'On the occasion of a formal dinner in a Government House at which precedence is strictly observed, on which side of his Hostess should the senior guest sit? ,? 'Is there any ordinary exce;- tion to this rule?' He set me the following reply dated the 2nd December 1335 from the Deputy Master of the Household*- ' v e always put the chief man on the ^ueen T s right and the chief lady on the King f s right - but I think it is perfectly correct to put the chief man on the Hostess^ left and if the numbers of men and women were exactly equal you would have to do this as otherwise at some point of the table you would have two ladles sitting together.^ 4. At a formal dinner at Court (or at Viceroy's nouse) there would always be Court officials present, so that the difficulty of two ladies sitting together would not arise. In /view of2 view of this difficulty, of the administr&lt;.titfti difficulties of a sioail establishment and-of the Deputy Master of the Household^ opinion that it is perfectly correct to place the chief man on his Hostess* left, it would £ip?:-ear appropriate in the circumstan ces obtaining at Bahrain to continue the procedure of placing the chief man on the Hostess* left. 3 . 1 am, however, addressing the Honourable the Political Resident on the subject with a view to ascertaining the wishes of Government in the matter.

I explained the difficulties which we had had in the past and after a good deal of thought it v.as decided that the best plan would be for Mr. Smith to mention the question of calls to those now here who had not called. Ft. Smith took the names of the married employees of the Oil Company, who have not called, and vas informed that „ only Mr. K^rby had called from among the bachelors. explained that I wanted to get the matter straight^as there ■0 will be a big show at the Shaikh 1 s session ceremonies) so that no one should be disappointed^as L cou^-d not ask those who had not called on the Agency. 3. It was decided that when the present calls had been settled I should suggest to Mr. Skinner that he shoula tell those employees who w ; ere coming now/ that if they wished to be included in social events '■{.'r- they should call on the Agency. 4. I ma.de it quite clear to ^r. Smith (and will do so to Mr. S' tuner) that I have no feeling on the subject at ail if, as some of them do, they do not wish to esii appear socially. That is entirely their business, but equally they must not be disappointed in that case if they are not asked to official or private functions at the Agency. 5.

Colonel and Mrs. Loch saw them off from the end of the pier. 23.3.1936.On the occasion of the Service held on the death of King George V I read the lesson in the ^hnrch. 2. I rather expected that the i^sion would ask me to do this again and Mr. Van Peursem came to ask me to do so for the Eastern morning service. I agreed to do so and read the passage^mentioned in the attached letter dated the 9t h April 1936 from Mr. Van Peursem. 3. The reading desk which was made for the service for the late King was used but in place of the Onion Jack covering the desk a white cloth was used.

Dinner was at 6.45 p.m* and the proceedings terminated at 8.15 p.m. The dinner was held in a room adjacent to the main reception hall. On another occasion it would be more satisfactory to have the food in the main reception room or else on the verandah as the odour of much mutton in a confined space coupled with the sight of an unusual quantity of neat is liable to give rise to a feeling of nausea when experienced for the first time by elderly gentlemen of fastidious tastes. 11th October.

A Garden Party was held on the 21st November Resident, Mr. N.M. Butler, Counsellor Tehran, Mr. Humphrey, Manager, Karachi Cable and Wireless). 3. Two copies of invitations are placed below.Note on two invitation incidents in connection with the Garden Party on 21st November 1936. Nr. E»J* Thompson came to the Assistant Political Agent (Mr# Howes) and told him that they had not had an invitation# It was found that one had actually been sent and Mespers* signature was in the peon book. A duplicate invitation was sent. (There h^s been previous difficulty*I understand, over the loss of letters addressed to rs. and Nr# Thompson - but nothing to do with Agency). 2# Mr. and Mrs. Tashburn and Nr. Graham did not answer the invitations. I asked Hr. Smith if they had got them 5 he could not be certain beyond that they had gone out with the others. I think that their not replying was deliberate owing to unpleasantness which had arisen over the St. Andrews' Night's Party to which Hr. and Mrs. r ashbum were not asked (though Mr. Graham had foorishly told them that they would be) owing to their behaviour the year before.

The call, as originally arranged should have been paid at the ^asr, as, however, repairs were being carried out to the Majlis, arrange ments were made for His Exce-llency to receive the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent at Mr. BeIgrave 1 s Offic e. 2. Tull Dress uniform and medals were worn. The Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent walked from the Agency to Mr. Belgrave's Office. 3. The Shaikh received the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent at the door of Mr. Belgrave r s Office then sat at the desk with the Political Agent on his right and the Assistant Political V\a&lt;3 Agent on tfte left. Mr. Belgrave who was present sat on the 1 Assistant^Political Agent’s right. The call lasted about 1/4 hour and the usual courtesies were observed. On leaving the Shaikh shook hands on the threshold of the Office. I think it was intended that the Shaikh should receive the call in the Joint Court room, owing to lack of warning of the Political Agent’s approach, however, the Shaikh had no time to get from Mr. Belgrave’s Office to the Court room before the Political Agent’s arrival. In future a farrash might be instructed to give five minutes warning of the Political Agent’s approach. 4. The return call was paid at the Agency on the same day about 1/4 of an hour later, the Shaikh was unattended. The Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent met His Excellency at the head of the stairs2 . 2. IV&gt; stairs and accompanied him to the head of the stairs on his departure.

A single chair for the ’ inister was placed in front of the front row of chairs. A hymnary was placed on each. Actually, owing to the large congregation, there was a slight shortage of books. 5.

Shaitchah Hissa Umm Rashid (she is I gather the only wife) her daughter Mossa, married to a person living in the Desert, a person and her dauguter Fatimah, aged about 6. known and reffered to as Bint-Mosa. I went to Dubai and was ushered into the women’s who presented me to her Mother, Shaikhah Hissa. Three chairs had passed us on our way through the street from the quay, and were the actual ones we had used in the launch, borrowed from a mercnant in the house next the oil geologists'. I smoked a cigarette, somewhat against my will, but it was pressed upon me, and when the ladies assured me they would smoke too, I accepted it, but they did not smoke and left me to smoke alone. I ascertaine later that Mrs Holmes who came a few days later, had been induced to smoke also, and she and I agreed that one would do a good deal if the the old Shaikhah so desired. I had been informed previously, 'put wise in fact' that the daughter was a great camel-rider and had beaten her uncle a few days before in a race. His rather acid comment had been 'She goes too fast.' I asked Mosa whether she was the rider of camels and she said yes, then when I mentioned the race she brigntened up and they all laughed like any thing and wondered how I had heard ; the Mother asked how I had heard and and I just said I had heard. Little Fatimah was induced to sit on my knee and I taugnt her to say 'How d'you do' in English. By this time there were about forty women round about, all in their black 'gubba' and they were much amusea. The mother of the child asked whether I would ride a camel with her ; had I ever ridden a camel - and out of the lattice I thought I saw two camels being saddled. But I think the Shaikhah thought it too great a familiarity the first time ; without any reference to me the saddles were removed again. Some sv/eetmeats were produced, and a very good pancake, very thin, very hot - which the Shaikhah doubled in her fingers for me, sweetened with sugar and tastea with nimbu, and it was delicious. Pictures of Tam and of Bahrain was looked at with interest, but generally upside down ; the idea of my Son appealed to them and they purred over him and hoped he was well. Incidentally photograph of Sh. Abdulla bin Hamad al Khalifah and Sh. Daij hang prominently in the ladies' apartment. 'Aud and tib were served, (the 'aud bottle would not pour from the spout and the water was tilted all over me). I was fetched by Sh. Juma'. apattments by Shaikh Jumma Received by MossaVisit to Sharjah , 29th January 1937. Shaikhah Mira (min Leiah) Umm Khalid (5) Muhammad (2) (Shaikhah •••••••• ) Umm Sagr (12) I paid a visit to Shaikhah Mira and was very kindly received by her, and the small children. I was ushered in by her stepson, Sagr, who came to Bahrain last year and saw our garden and the gazelle. He remembered all about these and was a great help in conversation. The Shaikhah said she had never seen Bahrain, but would like to come and visit me there,or at the ’Mahatta 1 (Airways Rest House) . A small meal was spread, of which the hard hulwa which I am accustome . to think of as Kuwaiti, was excellent. The Shaikhah likeu my photograptfis, especially of Tam, and looked at them intelligently, and asked about our house and garden at Bahrain. She wore a yellow silk ’thob 1 and no 'abba as tne women of Bahrain wear, but a black 'gubba' on her face, and when I asked is she would not remove it for me, she laughed but declined. She condtcted me to the gateway, showing me the turkeys from Bahrain as we went ; I saw the chil dren again, but I did not see her again. fV tifl) fit t 7 1Vi sit to Has al Khaimah, 1st February 1937, Shaikhah Ayeshah bint Sagr ^of Shargah) Urnm Khalid ( 8 ) Sagr ( 6 ) Shaikhah Fatimah no children, lives at Khatt. Shaikhah Umm Salim lives outside Has al Khaimah. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim took me to the women’s apartments and introduced me to two very, very shy ladies* As he withdrew a stream of women came round and all shook: hands and said Sabbakh Allhl bilkhair* A bench was provided for me but the ladies flopped on the ground ; I made as to sit down too, but they were insistent that I should occupy the bench (evidently provided at some trouole and great amusement, I gathered,) I had to do all the talking, and then one snyly asked, was I the 'mart al balioz'. Presently I produced photographs of Tam and of Bahrain and they became deeply interested and I lowered myself to the floor and they were all so occupied with the pictures they forgot to be shy and talked among themsilves about them. A servant woman was feeding her baby in the back ground and I asked about it - they promptly handed me the baby and thought that very funny 5 then the baby cried and I said it was thirsty and handed it back and they thought that awfully funny. They asked my name and I said Mrs Loch, out that was not what they wanted ; and when I said Nora they all repeated it and said it was my Arab name; I said no, that was my English name, my Arab name was Umm Tam, and they quite approved. But they wenoon calling me Nora to the end of tne day. They askeu about the journey from Shargah, how long we took when we started and so we got on to Arab time and English time ; I remarked that the Arab day began at sunset, and they said of course and when did the English day begin ? I said, in the middle of the night, but fell, even an English explanation fail of why it should be so. Some hulwa was produced and some hot milk. They laughed at my fur coat and fur cuffs and wanted to know what was the animal (seal-skin). T&gt;,ey enjoyed the photographs ; when the Shaikh came to fetch me he insisted on seeing all of them too, and kept one of Tam ; the senior Shaikhah kept another of Tam. The Shaikh was very pleasant and smiling when there. After we had been to Khatt, I went in to say Goodbye to the ladies ; one lives at Khatt ; tne Shaikh toid them that the P.A. had climbed the watch tower and they laughed. The elder boy K*‘alid took me down, and both boys brought me back to the Shaikh's room where the men waited. IYIK([* 2 Visit to A,iman . Shaikh Rashid, son 'Ali bmn Rashid (12 years).

Discussed breeds of aamels of note. ^ Pne course of a recent race was from Umm el Qauywain to Shargan. The Shaikh asked whether the P.A. nad any family and on being told he had one son, he po nted to Mrs Loch and aked ’Umm-huh ?’ - that £s ’Who is his mother - that one ? ’ Visit to Umm el Qaywain. Motored out about nine o’clock in the morning to Umm el qaywain. The Shaikh was in the Desert for a fortnight and his brother was left to receive the P.A. and he was sweating with anxiety w^hn we arrived, (at the same time as the sloop ’Bidexord was sip-hted from the same watch tower oy the same watchman. The watchmen haule i up the Shaikh s '(Shades of the Hyde Park Hotel and the Shaikh of Bahrain keek ing to sje if it was there as we drove down to A scot.) ~ e was of a distinctly sad countenance all through our interview, and almost paralysed with fear as he looked uooevery time the door swung open on its pole to admit one of the more particular merchants or other notables of the place who could muster a chair. In the end four chairs were produced, out for some rea son we all continue. to sit on the floor. He was an hospitable host, in lieu of nis o.rotner and asked us to remain to lunch ; obviously relievea when we did n 9 t , became less apprehnsious as we showed sims of going away, and when I had taken nis photo £raph, he even smiled - and when the Political Agent had' examined his ancient cannon with him, he even laughed and said he would like a more modren one. The P.A. then asked, ’Who would you go nd fig^t with i it?’ and he replied he would keep the peace, so they both laughe * and some of the followers too, and we came away leaving our hosts more friendly-feeling than we ha found them.

K«£-Confidential^ \ / n ^ /B in the Persian Gulf, D.O.No. C/774 ;e of the Political he&amp;ident Camp, Kuwait* Dated tjie 19th November, 1939. Dear Weightman, When I was last in Bahrain and visited the Shaikh, he had a high seat placed between two sofas with the result that I found myself about a foot lower than him. Would you kindly see that on any occasion where I am likely to meet him 2 chairs of equal size are arranged as conversation on different planes is difficult. I may be mistaken, but I think the idea is borrowed from Ibn Saud, who has these little thrones put up in each room that he is likely to go in, so that no one can sit in his seat. 2. While we are on this subject I may say that I saw a picture in your office of some official occasion in which the Shaikh was sitting on a sort of Woolworth throne, while the Political Officer, i think Cole, sat somewhere dowb by his coat tails in an ordinary chair. Cole was only an Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain, but I hope no Political Officer will ever put himself in such a ridiculous position again. 1 am afraid these ideas come from Belgrave, who is anxious to invest poor Shaikh Hamad with regal state, but nothing is further from the Arab mentality and Belgrave should be very firmly discouraged if he indulges in any more moves of this kind. If you get an opportunity you might mention the matter to him and remind him that Bahrain is not / i* H.Weightroan Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain.in Ruritania* Would you please have this letter filed where it will not be lost sight of. Yours sincerely.I arrived at Bahrain on Friday, the 16th January. As my predecessor, Major Alban, was leaving Bahrain on the same ship by which 1 had come, he was unable to introduce me in the customary fashion to His Highness the Shaikh. On Saturday, the 17th January, arrangements were made by telephone through the Adviserate for me to call on His Highness at Sakhir on Monday, the 19th January at 10.30 a.m. 2. I left the Agency at 9.45 a.m. on the 19th January, accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent, Mr. Jackson. V/e did not wear uniform. We used Mr. Jackson’s car on which the Union Jack was flown. We arrived at His Highness* palace hxi/t at Sakhir, after driving slowly for the last half jzn at exactly 10.30 a.m. His Highness the Shaikh approached the car to meet me and gave me a very warm v/elcome. We shook hands and, without relinquishing his grip on my hand, he led me to the majlis where we took our seats. His Highness the Shaikh sat between myself and the Assistant Political Agent. The usual courteous interchange of conversation took place. Coffee was served, then tea, and after sbout 12 minutes rose water and incense were brought. I took my leave shortly afterwards. The call had lasted almost exactly a quarter of an hour. His Highness accompanied me to my car and waited until I had driven away. 3. At the time of my reception by His Highness none of His Highness* relations were present nor were any other guests, though there was the usual crowd of retainers in the outer courtyard. 19/1/1942/t 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday, the 20th January? His Highness the Shaikh returned my call of the previous day. He came with his second brother (Shaikh Abdullah), his eldest son (Shaikh Salman) and his father-in-law (Shaikh Rashid). He was met, as he got out of his motor car, by Mr. Jackson who escorted him to the top of the stairs in the Agency where I met him. His Highness and I waited at the top of the stairs while he introduced me to the members of his family with him. One or two minutes after we had taken our seats in the drawing room, His Highness sitting^n asofa ^to my righ t^ coffee was served. Ten minutes later incense was brought in and His Highness took his leave after the visit had lasted almost exactly a quarter of an hour. I accompanied His Highness to the head of the stairs where we said good-bye. Mr. Jackson accompanied His Highness from the top of the stairs to his motor car below. Mr. Jackson and 1 did not wear uniform 20/1/1942DINNER i!3' At the Agency, Bahrain. 10th November 194$. Sunday morning the 9th November 1S41 witnessed a great hustle and busHe in the Agency compound. Cooking utensils, large kettles, provisions, crockery, firewood and coal were following one after another, the farrashes running on cycles, the coolies labouring under their loads and buses ana lorries unloading carpets and other heavier articles. All this made people enquiritive and the news spread like bon-fire in the town that the Ilon^ble Lt-Colonel 7/.R. Hay, C.I.E., the Political Resiaent in the Persian Gulf was holding a banquest in honour of His Highness the Shaikh on the ICth. 2. Letters of invitation were issued to the Shaikhs and invita tions to the Europeans were extended on the telephone. It was expressly brought home to the latter that the dress to be worn was a longe suit and not a dinner jacket. Besides High Highness the following members of the ruling family were invited • — • 1 . Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa al Khalifah 2 . M Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah 3. tt Salman bin Hamad al Khalifah 4. M Rashid bin Muhamad al Khalifah 5. fl Ibrahim bin Hamad al Khalifah 6. II Khalifah bin Hamad n 7. II Mubarak bin Hamad n 8. II Abdulla bin Hamad ti 9. It Du'aij bin Hamad it 10 . II Ahmad bin Hamad ti 11 . II Ahmad bin Muhammad it 12 . II Ali bin Muhamad n 13.

Major R.G.E.W.^Iban, Political Agent. 2. CaptainR.D.Metcalfe, Publicity Officer nt 3. Mr. R.I.Hallows, Under Secretary to the Hon'ble the Pol.Reside 4. Mr. G.N.Jackson, Assistant Political Agent. 5. Mr. De Grenier, Officiating Adviser 6 . Dr. Snow, State Medical Officer 7. Mr. Steele, State Engineer S. Mr. Lipp, Manager, Bahrain Petroleum Co.Ltd. 9. Mr. Wakelin, Director of education 10; Mr. Hutchings, Principal, Technical College 111 Lieut-Commahdant Baines of the Navy 12. Major Hewitt, Defence Officer 13. Dr. Steele, the Agency Assistant Surgeon. 3. With the exception of two occasions - the New Year’s Day and His Majesty’the King Emperor’s Birthday - when His Highness’ car stops in front of the old south gate of the Agency, obviously, because His Highness inspects the Guard of Honour on those junctures, the usual place for His Highness' car to stop is opposite the North veranda from where His Highness is sssstsd escorted through the western staircase to the head of the stairs and thence into the drawing room. But owing to the fact that the passage between the head of the stairs and the drawing room, as will be explained later, it was decided that the guests should enter through the last stairs on the eastern extremity of the northern veranda. To avoid complication and perplexity, two farrashes in uniforms were appointed at the outskitts of the veranda to guide the cars to the fixed point and two farrashes in red flannel uniforms with silver covered daggers stuck in the belt, were placed at the head of the stairs. One strong bulb was installed at the2 . entrance of the veranda and another on top of the eastern staircase. The space occupied between this staircase and the drav/ing room was well carpeted. It was also a proposal in the beginning to beautify the staircase as well with carpets but as they could not have been placed except by being stuck with nails in order to prevent the guests from stumbling and as sticking them with nails would have ruined the carpets, it was considered best to leave the stair with its perpetual vacant look. The upper eastern veranda was richly adorned with blue, red and yellow striped flags and the entrance to the drawing room was decorated with flags placed cross-wise on the top as if it were arch. The drawing room is always tip-top and no special decorations were added to it. The space flanking the drav/ing room on the west and surrounded by windows on the opposite side was converted into the dining room. It was luxuriously floored with Kirmani and Turkish carpets of diverse hue and design. Half a dozen of thick cushioned pillows v/ere provided for the guests to lean, f An equal number of long lanterns with electric bulbs inside were hung to the ceiling and wrapped with thin red and red pink paper. The effect of the red lights was reminiscent of a continental hall room or a Viennese carabet hall. The dining room was closed on the south v/ith a screen with a passage for the ingress of the servants. 4. The guests were expected at one o'clock Arabic,i.e. one hour after sunset, which as at that time 6.30 Bahrain time. But His Highness arrived quarter of an hour before time and his brothers and cousins even earlier. Escorted by the Indian Assistant and w r ith two red-uniformed farrashes walking in front, His Highness was hailed by Major R.G.E.V/.Alban, the Political .agent, at the head of the staircase and ushered into the drawing room followed by other guests. In the drawing room His Highness was seated to the right of the Honourable host and the Political agent to the left - all facing to the north and the other guests. Shaikh Muhammad, Shaikh Abdulla, Shaikh Salman, ShaiPih Rashia and Mr. Je Grenier and Mr. Lipp were sitting on the couches on the right and left. The other guests were in cushioned chairs. A round of Arab coffee started, the 'crimson-dressed' farrashes pouring the coffee and the guests sipping it and shaking the cups (finjals) v/ith a jerk in a traditionally Arab manner as an indication of their satisfaction and their unwillingness to have any more. It is one of the 'convenient' habits of the Arabs common to all parts of the Arab countries and prevents interruption of conversation which would be unavoidable if the guest' were to speak to the coffee-server to stop. 5. The north and the east doors of the drav/ing room v/ere open: the v/est door was closed. In the vicinity of half past seven, the Indian Assistant opened the west dooy, stepped in a typically Arab fashion whispered to the Political Agent: 'The Dinner is ready,Sir!' (It is a common Arab habit in the Gulf States to whisper even in large gatherings and no exception is taken it). The whispered message was passed to the host who v/ith dignity combined with graciousness said to the chief guest 'Please!' (Tafaddal) and stood up. This served as a signal to .other guests and all followed in the wake. Tw r o farrashes v/ere standing on either side of the doo^with washing requisites and the guests washed their hands as they v/alked out of the drawing into the dining room v/hero a delightful banquet was awiting them. The host seated the chief guest to his right and Shaikh Muhamad bin Isa to his left. The Political Agent took his seat to the left of His Highness with Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa to his right fllowed by Mr. DeGrenier, the Officiating Adviser, and Shaikh Rashid, His Highness' father-in-law. Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa had Mr. Lipp the Resident Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company limited, on his right and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad was immediately after Mr. Lipp and to the right of Liieut-Commander Baines. The remaining guests took their seats wherever they found one vacant. The banquet was divided into two parts - the chief table for the chief guest and the other guests of importance, and the other for those of less consequence. This pre-arrangement was readily scented by the guests and, owing to the awe-inspiring presence of the dignified host and the guest of honour, there was a terrific rush on the second table and the Indian Assistant had to request and persuade some of them to move to the chief table in order to relieve congestion and he was not totally successful in his efforts. The result3. result was that the guests were packed up like sardines and there was hardly a space to move. Still every body did full justice to the feast and those whose hands could not reach a certain dish requested their neighbours quietly to push a piece to then. Most of the guests were leaning on one side - right or left - as there was no place to sit cross-legged; and one of them witting remarked at the end of the dinner. 'Let us sit now straight. All my food has got on one side of the stomach. Let it come now in the centre.' 6 . With regard to the menu it has all along been the practice in the Agency dinners of this nature and that because it is an Arab dinner it must be entirely and essentially an Arab dinner. The noble idea lying behind this practice was that it would certainly be more pleasing to His Highness and his kit and kin if they were served with courses of their own taste; and with that ideology it was only compatible that the food should be entirely and Essentially Arab. But that tradition was broken this time and it was considered that the Arab food with a touch of Persian cousin*, would be more palatable than the old hockneyed dishes to which the guests are used in every day life. Thus while the essentials of an Arab menu were maintained the Arab menu was not, retained in its entirety. The chief Arab food served in the honour of a guest is a ghoozi ; and two ghoozis were prepared one for each table. Besides this, instead of being cooked ina p rosaic way, rice was prepared in two varieties in Persian style mixed with saffron and other niceties.Also there were roast chickens, Qarma, Qima and Kabab (Persian Cutlets). To add to the guests of the food and to make it more appetising, lemon and mixed fruit pickles were provided. Jelly combined with starch cooked in milk served the part of the pudding and cooled as it was in the fish moulds it was a delightful sight to see the white sweet fish lying in the dishes as it were ready to swim in contrast to other red or brown victuals. No fresh fruits were available except the state, half ripe, half dry and half wrinkled bananas which it was not considered worth while to have; and tinned mangoes, peaches and pears filled in the gap. The course, were laid on a large thin round mat with the ghoozi in the centre and the other dishes encircling it. The food was simply delicious and the guests were unanimous in their verdict that this was the best dinner they ever had in the Agency. It was this deliciousness and flavourness, perhaps, which caused the dinner to last over half an hour; otherwise even the most luxurious Arabt feasts are finished within quarter of an hour. This extraordinary zestfulness of the feast was, as an Arab would say, undoubtedly due to 'the good intention of the host' 7. Before finishing the tale of food, le^t us dewll upon the origin and the significance of what us called 'ghoozi', an indispensible asset to magnificent feast and parties in greater parts of the ^rab world and particularly in this part in which the dinner in question was held. Ghoozi is a corrupt form of the Turkish expression '^oozi' meaning a tender sheep, not more than a year old, whether live or baked. In Iraq it still retains its original form and sense but in Bahrain and throughout the Gulf a Ghoozi is only a fat-tailed sheep baked in oven. It is interesting to note how the ghoozis can be baked in an oven simultaneously. The stomach of the sheep is cleaned and well washed out. Then it is filled with rice, eggs, fried onions raw gram, raisins, almond nuts, saffron, dried lemons and rose-water. The sheep is placed in a tray with its head down and the fat tail on top; and the skull is also placed along with it. Baking kidneys, liver or ±±x is tabooed. The tray is put in an oven which is not an underground one but a piece of mud work raised on the ground. Before the sheep is placed inside, the oven is well warmed up and there is no smoke or flame in left the fire, the coals of fire are spread around the belt of the oven and the sheep tray is put in the centre surrounding by burning coals of fire. The mouth of the oven is well closed with a number of thin mats which are put one on top of another about half a dozen of them - and then covered with an equal number of flat stones( Furoosh ). The ghoozi is then slowly baked by the heat generating from the coals of fire and is ready for table usually within four hours. 8 . The dinner was over about 8.00 p.m. Hands were washed in the usual oriental fashion and the guests began to return to the drawing room. Coffee was served second time and after 15 minutes two pairs of crimson dressed farrashes appeared with »0od' (incence wood) af termmm ■MV 4. after which, as the Arabs say, there is no '^u’ood' (sitting). This inhailing the incensed smoke and wetting their hands and beards with the rose water, the guests started to make xk a move, the Honourable the Political Hesident walking with the shaikh to the head of the staircase fallowed by the Political Agent and the other Shaikhs and shaking hands with them and 'entrusting them to God’s care' (fi-amanillah). 9. In brief, it was a delightful show. The weather was calm. The provebi^partly damp and partly cold 'N'shi' or Bahri breeze, which is harf way between the 'Shamal' (the north wind) and the 'Kaus' (the south wind) had ceased blowing late in the afternoon. There was no moon but the stars, the sentinels of the sky, were all bright and occasionally winked at the universe below. The sea was visible in front and the hurricane lights of the country craft were breaking its monotony. To borrow a verse from Wordsworth, 'It is a beauteous evening, calm and free; The holy time is quiet as a Nun.' Or, to sing with shelly his lyric of Recollections, r*! 'The highest wind was in its nest, The tempest in its home. The whispering waves were half asleep The clouds were gone to play, And on the bosom of the deep The smile of heaven lay.'</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000027_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/646</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000027</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/646</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'27/2 I Etiquette'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-07-17T21:15:59</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (206 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged chronologically from the front to the back of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 206; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
