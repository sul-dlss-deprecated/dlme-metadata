In addition, it includes some papers relating to expenditure on diplomatic and consular establishments in Turkish Arabia, Muscat and China, as well as Persia.The file includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Levant Consular Service</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Consuls</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Treasury</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Turkish Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>China</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomats</topic></subject><subject><topic>Embassies and consulates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Government spending</topic></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Persian Agreement (1919)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000209#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000209#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000209#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000209#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
