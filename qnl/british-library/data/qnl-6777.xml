Advance to Baghdad- Political Considerations. Note by Political Department, India Office. ^ 1! ' ' l( ^ ^ (,x &gt; 1,1 a recent telegram (-/th September 1915), expressed the view that the fall of Constantiaople or Baghdad were the only events likely in allrci the situation in Persia. I he lall of Constantinople appears, unfortunately, to be more remote than ever; but Baghdad is within our ^rasp, and its early occupation would apparently present little military dilHrnliy, arid could be accomplished without reinforcing the troops under Sir John Nixon's command. There can be little question that the occupation by British troops of the ancient seat of the Khalifate would produce an immense impression, not only in I ersia, but throughout the Middle Kast. Orientals are impressed by tangible success, which can be measured in square miles and demonstrated on the map, much more than by negative results, however brilliant or important, such as our armies have achieved in the West. Thus the conquest of German South-West Africa, to judge from the congratulatory messages and accounts of public rejoicings which have reached the India Office, caused much more stir in India, where it represented the lirst solid achievement of British arms after months of uncertainty, than it aroused in England where the relative unimportance of the event was better appreciated. During the present war, our enemies have achieved this kind of taniiible success in many directions; we have done so in two theatres only, viz., Mesopotamia and South-West Africa, and have conspicuously failed in a third region where events have been watched with paramount interest throughout the Midnle East. Sir G. Koos Keppel recently bore testimony to the eil'ect produced by the fall ol Warsaw, and German victories in Russia, upon the tribesmen of the North-West Frontier, where the impression of South-West Africa our one decided success in local estimation—is beginning to fade. In these circumstances it appears to be of primary importance, for the maintenance of our prestige in the East, th^t we should get full value out of our military achievements wherever possible. If we stop short of Baghdad, the political effect of our victorious advance into Mesopotamia will be largely discounted. The fact of our halting, when the whole world expects us to go on, will undoubtedly be ascribed to weakness. We shall be regarded as having 44 shot our bolt,' and so far from seeing an end to our difficulties in Persia, we shall leave the I ersians more firmly convinced than ever that they have nothing to fear from us, and can afford to ignore our interests and disregard our advice. Everywhere our friends will be discouraged and our enemies will gain contidence, and the decisive blow, which is to set us right in the eyes of the East, will remain unstruck. What prospect is there o f its being struck in any other theatre of war in the near future? Apart from more general considerations, the occupation of Baghdad will bring us one very definite strategical advantage, viz.: control over the Baghdad-Kermanshah route, which is the sole channel by which the Germans i V-i. can communicate with the outside world. We know from recent reports that the Germans themselves attach the utmost importance to the maintenance of this line of communication, which is vital to their position in Persia and to their projects in regard to Afghanistan. Mr. Marling tele graphed from Tehran on the 1st October:— 44 All reports show that the 44 Germans are bringing in very considerable quantities of arms and ammuni- 44 tion via Kermanshah to Ispahan, and that practically the whole of the 44 Turkish force under' Haouf Pasha that has been waiting at Saripul has ' been brought surreptitiously to Kermanshah, where German \ ice- ' Consul is said to have also some 1,100 tribesmen in his pay. 1 his may S.B.' indicate an attempt to reach Afghanistan with a considerable force.' The danger here indicated is a real one. The Amir has hitherto behaved admirably, in the face of much adverse pressure ; but it is impossible to say what would be the effect upon him of the arrival on the Afghan frontier of armed Turco-i ; erman forces in considerable numbers. If he gave way, and proclained jlltad (as he has long been urged to do), we should have the North-West Frontier in a blaze, and might have to undertake operations which would strain our military resources to breaking point. If we close the Kermanshah-Baghdad route andisolate the Germans, we place it beyond their power to operate against us on any considerable scale either in Persia or Afghanistan. The political advantages to be anticipated from the occupation of Baghdad are thus two-fold:—(1) it will revive British prestige in the Middle East, and (2) it will place us in a position to cut the German line of communication with Persia. Once the occupation is a fait accompli, we may fairly expect a rapid improvement in the present highly unsatisfactory situation in Persia, and an easy solution of the various problems (defence of oil-tields, &amp;c.), with which we are confronted in that country The danger of jiluul on the North-West brontier will be greatly lessened, and the belief in our ultimate victory greatly strengthened both within and beyond our own borders. These objects are clearly wort h risking something to attain. The question is how much risk we are justified in taking. In the case of Baghdad the accom plishment of our immed iate object presents no serious military difficulties. We can be certain of our coup de thedtre, whatever subsequent embarrassments may follow in its wake. Uetreat from Baghdad would doubtless have most unfortunate results ; bui retreat from our present position at Kut-el-Amara (which surely is not outside the range of possibility in certain eventualities) would from the politic al point of view I e almost equally disastrous. In any case, it must presumably be some months in the most unfavourable event- before the Turks could collect sufficient troops seriously to threaten our position at Baghdad. In the interval, events may have happened elsewhere to ease the situation, or we may be in a better position than at present to reinforce Sir .1. Nixon's army. We are bound to take risks, whether we go to Baghdad or stay where we are. Either course may, conceivably, land us in embarrassing or even disastrous consequences. But as a choice has to be made, political consider ations appear to point decidedly towards the adoption of the bolder course. J. E. S. I entirely agree. It may he true that we can take up a position at Kut- el-Amara which may be locally impregnable. But if the Turco-Germans can put into the field a force capable of turning us out of Baghdad, it seems probable that the same force will be able, even if we do not occupy Baghdad, to produce a condition of nffmrs in Mesopotamia and Persia that will necessitate withdrawal Irom I\ut-el- mara 11 that is so, there is nothing to choose between the two, and the question is not whether Kut is more defensible than Baghdad, but what reasonable probability is there of the 1 urks being able to release a iorce sufficient for their purpose ? bth &lt; )ctober 1915.
