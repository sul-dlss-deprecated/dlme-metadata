At Bahrain there is nov a large Oilfield employing some 300 F-uropeana, and turning out aurne 100,000 tons of crude oil » month. A refinery will shortly be working there, after which - if the quality of the oil comes up to standard - the Sloops of the i ersian Gulf Division would be able, if necessary, to procure their fuel from Bahrain instead of having to depend on Abadan. The advantage oi having an oil supply, whether for the immediate needs of the Sloops or for further afield, in a British protected State like Bahrain as well as one in a foreign country, i.e. Iran, is obvious. In case of .var, with Iran neutral our oil supplies from Abadan might be difficult, and with -.ran as an enemy might conceivably cease altogether, at any rate for a time. In Kuwait and &gt;tar there are potential Oilfields, the possibilities of which are being explored, and perhaps others on the Trucial Coast, and in Muscat terrii&amp;ty. Cables run as followsi Fao to Busnire - two lines. Bushire to Bahrain. Bahrain to Jask. Jask to Museat-Karachi. At Bahrain there is a public wireless station, and at Sharjah an Imperial Airways wireless station which a Iso does comnercial traffic /(Ply -3- (5).

Ve are of course on friendly terras with Iran and Saudi Arabia, and have a Treaty of Alliance with Iraq, but in spite of this I d 0 not suppose that the growth of military power by States surround ing the uulf area can be entirely disregarded. *ncidentally Iran lays claim to Bahrain, though ol late she ms let this claim lie dormant. * here are no defences in any of the Arab Shaiicndoma. If we were at war the SnaiJcnaoraa would also be in a similar position on our side, and the Hulers would certainly co-operate with us to the best of their power, but have no military forces at their disposal, except some IbO armed police in Bahrain and a similar number of Levies in Muscat. 2.

Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Kuwait. Dated the 18th January 1938. You will remember that just before I left London I attended a Meeting of an Interdepartmental Committee wiUcb discussed the subject of legislation for the Persian Gulf (i.e. the Arab side) in the event of a major \mr. In due course the recommendations of the Committee will doubtless take their final form, and our war legislation scheme can then be put away in a drav/er ready to be pulled out when and if the emergency arises 2. A cognate question which has been somewhat excerolsing my mind since my return is whether a similar scheme exists for the defence of the Gulf in the event of a major war, co-ordinating the activities of the Naval, military, loyal Air Forcejand local Political Authorities ? If so I have not seen it, and presumably the co-operation of the Resident would be required to assist in the carrying out of the scheme. If a such a scheme does not exist then I suggest that the matter be laid before the Committee of Imperial Defence or whatever is the appropriate body, so that one may be drawn up. I quite realise that owing to the special conditions prevailing in the Gulf it may not be possible to draw in ad vance hard and fast plans such as is possible in other parts of the world where/ J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., The India Office, London.^ l iO ~ 2 - v/here we have important strategical interests. At the same time some sort of scheme is better than none, and I enclose a Note on which such a scheme might be based. Even if a scheme already exists perhaps this Note may be of use on certain points. iMetcalfe may like to give a copy of this letter and the Note to Army Headquarters). 3. There is one point in connection with my Note which I wish to make perfectly clear • You will see that in regard to the defence of certain areas in the Gulf I have asked: Is it intended to send troops ? Can arrangements be made against a possible attack from the air, or from the sea ? and so forth. Some of these questions may appear rather wild, and to answer themselves in the negative, but I have posod them deliberately in order to get definite decisions. In putting these questions therefore I do not for a minute mean to suggest that troops should be sent to any particular area, or that arrangements in that area against air or naval attack are imperative. These are questions which must be decided by higher authorities with due regard to the heavy respmsibi- lities which the Services, in the event of a major war, will have to meet in other areas. The object of my Note indeed is not to advocate the assumption of unnecessary defence caramitments in the Gulf, but to try and ensure that we should avoid them. During the Great War I served as a Political officer in the Gulf, Iraq (Mesopotamia as it was then) and Persia, and looking back I cannot help feeling that if in this part of the world v/e had planned a little more ahead in time of peace, we would in time oftaar have been saved many unnecessary and costly commitments e.g. in Persia. (See for instance paragraph 8 (2) of my Note). 4 /4. You will see that in my Note I have included details which are of course perfectly well-known to you, as well as to Seymour, Metcalfe, Courtney and Poland* If my Note goes to Committee, however, it will have to he considered by authorities who may not have the same knowledge of the Gulf. I have^therefore thought it best for purposes of ready reference to present as full a picture as possible# I am sending a copy of this letter, with enclosure, to Seymour and to Metcalfe, as well as to Courtney and Poland, who as Air Officer Commanding, Ira^, and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, respectively, are concerned with defence matters in the Gulf.

(1) P»ntlnal Hesldent. The position or ine Political Resident is a somewhat peculiar one. On the Persia, aide of the Gulf the Resident is Consul.General, aushire, only and as such works under the Minister, reuran. ae im*^*L* headquarters at Bushire, with no responsibilities outside that consular area, (see para B raph 6 below), unlike in former times when the Consul-General. Bushire. was also Consul- General for the whole of South Pereia from Ahwat to the Indian frontier. On the Arab side of the Gulf this ofiicial is however Resident, and as such his area stretcnes from Xu wait to Bhofar (about half-way between huso at and Aden), an extent of about 2500 miles. In this area the Resident nas fairly heavy responsibilities both towards His Majesty's Ocrernment as well as to the Government of India. Ihese responsibilities, it is hardly necessary to say, would not decrea&amp;e i** time of war# (2) Ihe other Authorities in the Gulf are the Itinister, Tehran, on the Persian side, the Air Officer Ccomanding, Iraq, In whose command is included tne Arab side, and the Senior Ifaval Officer, Persian Gulf Bivision. 2. The followiag factors affect both sides of tne Gulf Persian and Ar&amp;b# (l) Gomgmniofrti one # Cable aal tireless Limited operate the only cable /-2- cable linKlng India with Iraq, which rune from Karachi to ?ao via Muscat ani Bushire. {The Company are at present removing the lin* at Jaslc). A eocontt cattle runs froe Bushire to J?ao, and a third links Bushire with Banrai n. The Company als operate a Mreless Station at Bahrain, which can comnumoate with Basrah, Karachi and Aden, and propose to op« a rfirelese Station at Kuwait. There is at present at Kuwait an Iraqi Telegraph Office linKed by land line with Basrah. dhe Royal Air Force operate a wireless station at Muscat, and there are Imperial Airways stations at -.aTjah and Owadur. On the Iranian side there are Iranian Government Tireless Stations at Bushire and Jask, and Anglo-J reman Oil Company Stations at Genoweh and Gach qaraghuli. (2) He c Persi an G ulf Division# As I understand it (I write under correction) the Sloops of this Bivision would not be available lor any local defence on either side of the Gulf - Persian or Arab, as they would be carrying out the important duty of blocking the mouth of the Gulf against the entry of hostile craft. The base of this Division ie at Bahrain with a small advance base at Khor Khawi, in Muscat territory, at the mouth of the Gulf. (3) Aerial attack* ^ question of much importance is whether in the event of a major *ar the Gulf, by reason of its remoteness from hostile centres, would be free from attacx by enemy aircraft ? This is naturally a technical question which I can express no opinion. (4) Aviation. The Ai^ tfranoe and K.X.M. Air Linee r xii along the / on-3- the Persian, while Imperial Airways use the Arab, side, (gee paragraph 13 (l) below). The Air Prance land at Bu.hrre for mails and passengers, and the K.L.K. as passengers otter .ni occasionally for refuelling. The Air Prance a ntght .top at JasP. and K.L.K. only occasionally for refuelling. The arrangements of these two Companies with tne Ionian government for permission to fly over, and land in, Ir^iah^ territory are it is understood on a short-time basis renawade at intervals, and it is possible that both the K.L.U. and Mr prance may at some future date apply to us for permission to uae tne Arab side. The K.L.*. have already made tentative .eves in that direction. There is anotner. purely military, air route Com hu.cat to Dhofar (thence to Aden) recently established by the Royal Air Force witn the hex, or Political Agent, Muscat, and of this Residency, (see para graph 25 ( 8 ) below). These various routes combine to tnis part of tne world of considerable importance f om ti' point of view of Aviation, and the x&gt;eioian Oulf - te «•§.«■ e. 4 « viT'fao a • is now The Suez Ulanal of the somewhat journalistic phrase i Ai r. 3 . The Oulf from the strategical aspect divides itself naturally int c two main areas - the Persian side end tne Arab side# aN SIDS# 4 . in a major war Persia, as far as we were concerned, might be * - (a) BsneTolerrtly neutral or (b) Hostilely neutral or (c) At open war with us or (d) In a etate of anarchy, more or less pronounced, following on the death of the present Shah if tnat had /-4- had occurred by then.

In case this Interest is seriously tnreatened there is, I understand, a special scheme for sending a iorce to this area. X h.ve not seen this schme. and there would not appear to be any reason why I should, since on the Persian side I have no responsibilities outside Bushire area. (2) A t Khorraashahr we have a Vice-Coneulate. The number of British subject, is about 2000. practically *11 employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 6.

B* Bushire itself. c. The small ports of Lingah, Jask and Charbar. 7. with regard to A. Oanoweh-Mishun-Oach qaraghuli. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have a ha* base at the small port of Oanoweh, about 60 miles north of Bushire, for /for their drilling operations in the iiaoh laraghuli area.. Ganoweh ie linked hy road with Gach ^agmli with Ahwaz via Behbehaa, and with Khorramehanr via Hindian. xhe Comiany operate nreleea Stations at Ganoweh (which also acta as a Direction Finding Station) and at Gach qataghuli. 1 do not | know whether this area is or is not included in the defence scheme for Abadan and the Oil Fields, (see paragraph (l) above)• 8. (l) With regard to B. aishire contains i- (1) The Ree idency and staff* (2) Gable and tireless Office. (3) A Branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran. (*) A Branch of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie S= Co.Ltd., the British India Agents. (5) Br it ia h and the Residency Staff t Indian British subjects* including to the number of about 100. (6) An aerodrome used by K.L.M* ana Air France. (2) During the Great tar oonaiderabie political and strategical importance was attached to Bushire, and a 9 large number of troops - which towards the end of the a: rose to about an Indian «rmy Division - were stationed here to protect tne town against Waasmusa (the German Agent, ana his Persian tribesmen. My own opinion, for what it ie worth, is that the war-time importance attached to Bushire (as indeed to the whole of Persia) was muoh exaggerated, and that it would have been better for Bushire to have been evacuated, thus ^ avoiding tying up troops tnere who were badly needed in otner war areas Seg. Iraq. (3) It is impossible 1&amp;f course to foretell wnat will be the condition of Persia in the event of a major war, (see paragraph // -6- paragraph 4 above), but if this condition, whatever it may be,involves a hostile threat to Bushire, (as before), it seems to me quite possible for us to maice up our minds now w&amp;at action we should tafce« Would it be worth while to send troops to protect / Bushire ? If so f how many and from where . How will they toe transported ? On arrival at Bushire what positions will they taiee up ? How will the be rationed and so forth ? In view of the fact that troops were in Bushire during the areat War there must of course be full details witn regard to these questions in the files of army headquarters, India. If it is not worth sending troops, then - if the threat is serious enough - the alternative is evacuation. o With regard to C. The small ports of Lingah, Jask and Charbar* Lingah and Jask fall under the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and therefore in ay Consular area. Charbar falls within the Iranian Mekran District, and therefore under His Majesty's Consul*General for tOiarasan, \t Lingah there is an emergency landing ground. There are no British eubjects# At Jask there is a landing ground and an Iranian Government y/T Station. Ho British suojeets* At Charbar tnere is a small colony of Indian Bri -isu eubj ec ts • v During the Great var there was a small detacnaent ot\ troops at Jask f but since the Station of Cable and Yireless Ltd. at this place is now being removed, (see paragraph 2 (1) above), I presume that both Jasic as well as Lingah and Charbar /-7- Cbarbar can be ignored V Tbe evaouation of Indian driven subjects from Charbar might have to be considered. 10. Bandar Abba- does not fall within my Consular district, but in that of His Majesty's Consul, Kerman, who spends a portion of the Winter in that port. Apart from the Consulate, the only British interests are a branch of Messrs.

The importance of this route is obvious, as if it is 'out* in time of war, for the perioc tnat it remains cut no British civil aircraft, ana Royal Air Force aircraft only with difficulty (by the Adeh-Muscat Route, (see paragraph 25 (S) below), can reach India, Singapore or Australia. (2) In regard to tiie cutting oi a- axi imagine this can be done in one or more of the following ways.- (a) by a hostile force seizing an aerodrome or &amp;er odr canes \ (b) by feembarding fuel supplies from the sea (e) by kombing fuel supplies from the air (d) by sabotage of fuel supplieo tarough the medium of agents ( e k by cutting up aerodromes tnus making ^ imposBiblt for aircraft to land (f) by destruction of #/T Stations tins rendering air navigation difficult. 14 . With regard to B* (l) The preeent oil poeition on the £rab aide is as fellows. At Kuwait, boring by the Kuwait oil Company bo far without success. At Bahrain, a large and flemrisiung oil field. At Qatar, boring by Petroleum Concessions Limited. On the Trucial Coast and at Muscat, concession., ootained oy Petroleum ConceBsions Limited.

She sending of a force to dhorraasnahr (if it is necessary to dooo) might taKe some little time, and in the interval no oil might be forthcoming from tnat quarter. If dsring this period the refinery at Bahrain were destroyed, (see paragraph 20 (2) below), the Sloops of the lersi an uuli Division would presumably nave to rely on tneir stocks of fuel at Bahrain and Khor Xhawi. If these, in their turn, had been destroyed, tne Sloops might be immobilised unless i uei »as forthcoming from Iraq, which might, in time oi war, present difficult i ee. 15. With regard to C. and D.

The question of supplies would be difficult as the State has no local resources. The local supply of drinking water is inadequate and indifferent.

( 2&gt; x imagine the landing of a hostile force at Bahrain is extremely unlirely ? If, however, a hostile cruiser or submarine with a large calibre gun were to run the blockade of the Persian Gulf Sloops, either could, 1 presume, by bombardment damage or destroy without men difficulty the refinery, the local fuel aapplies for the Persian Gulf Division, Royal Air Poroe and Imperial Airways, tne works at tne Oil yields as well as the Telegraph ana »/f stations.

If this menace cannot oe ruiaa out* paragraph 2 (3&gt; above), is U worth while or practicable to arrange for local means of defence (e.g. anti-aircraft guns) 1 21. (1) I n addition to attack from outsiae, tnere is also the question of tne intarnal security of rsan ^ u. me onief danger in tnis direction would appear to be in satotate; of the refinery, tne oil field works, local supplies of fuel, aerodromes, felegraph ana *//T Stations, and the Kaval a,3. in the Great War both sldee through the medium of agents engineered sabotage of military supplies etc. and aouctlesa the same praotice will again be adopted. Bahrein is not of course an area in which it is easy for an ememy to place agents during peace, ready to act in time of war, or in which to introduce agents once war has been declared, m view, however, of our interests in the State, pereouafry i do not think it would be safe to assume tnat tne General Staffs of our potential enemies have not oasi td* e. e on Bahrain, (we have had smae doubtful visitors there in tns past few years), that no attempt at sabotage would be made, and that therefore we can leave our interests there entirely unprotected. Unless therefore it is decided tnat tne risk of sabotage is so small as to be negligible s dae scaeme for internal security will have to be evolved. (2) At the Interdepartmental Committee mentioned in paragraph 1 of the covering letter to tnia Note tne question was discussed of giving the Kesident and his political Agents legislative powers vo aeal octane at 3 &amp;hr&amp;in y gjs in the other Arab States of the Persian *&gt;ulf f by/-15- by declaring certain areas a» M forbidderi rt &gt; ana by iriilicting puniument on of lenders. It is, however, equally, if not more, important for the local Political Authorities in the Arab States, particularly Bahrain, to have at their disposal sane means of preventing sabotage from actually occurring. The obvious means towards this end is the provision of guards for the various localities concerned. If it is not tnougnt worth while for this purpose to send troops to Banrain, then we must fall bac* on local resources. (5) The number of guards required would be fairly large having regard to the dispersion of the localities concerned, the oil-field for instance is some 3 miles from the refinery, and 14 miles from the Telegraph Office, */? station and the Naval Base, while two of the localities - t e oil-field and refinery - are of considerable extent. It is dountful whether any guards would be available from tne Bahred n police, whose numbers in normal times are o^ly sufficient for their ordinary duties, which would inevitably increase in the abnormal conditions prevailing in time of war. Special local guards would therefore have to be raised, and the numbers, armament and rate of pay should be sett lea now so that if and when the emergency arises they can begin their duties immediately. The number of guards required could be much reduced if certain localities were enclosed by a barbed wire fence. If this is to be done at all, presumably it will have to be done now i.e. in peace time. 22 .

His Majesty's Ooyernment Hare guaranteed the protection of qatar from attacK by sea (vide Article* of Treaty dated the 3rd Norember 1916 with the ShaUh of ^tar - Aitcheson, Volume XI, Page 2b8). Ihe answer to the question as to ho. His Majesty's Oorernment propose to implement tnis guarantee is by blocking the mouth of the Persian Gulf by the Persian Gulf hivislon. His Majesty's Government a. an inducement to the Shaikh to give the oil concession to Petroleum Concessions limited recently also promised him protection by land, though he is expected to aeai with minor incursions himself. Owing to the position of tuc qatar frontier, the responsibility for protective operations would presumably fall mainly o« the Royal Air vorce, and an aerodrome has been constructed in the State. 23. TRUCIAX COAST. This area covers some half a dozen small Shaikh. dems from Abu Bhabi to Xalba, and is under the charge of the political Agent, Bahrain, who is represented locally by an Arab official of this Residency whose title is the nesidency Agent, and who has his headquarters at Sharjah. «hiie tne limits of the Shaikhdoms along the coast are Known, tnair territories inland have never been delimitated, mere are Indian British trader, on the coast at most of the Shaikhdoms Petroleum concessions limited have oil concessions from the local Shaikhs, but have not yet comae need operation, mere are /.17 are the ueuei pre-emption cleueee in favour of nis Ma eety's Government in these eonoessione. 24. (1) His Majesty's Government have guaranteed ti^e proteotion of tne Trucial Coast ShaiKhdom. by sea from local aggression (vide the Treaty of Peace with tne i'ruciai Chiefs of 4th May 1853 - Atieheson, Volume XI, Pate 202 &gt;* in view, however, of our interest, on the Coast, we could not be indifferent to a^ attach, by sea. His Majesty’s G«v em inent have not guaranteed the protection of tnese bnai.inao^s by lend, and this question can therefore be considered purely from the extent of our own interest, in tnis area. I- the Great war no troops were landed on tne Xrucial Coast. (2) Pros the defence point of view the importance of the Truoial Coast lies in its being the next stage after B^ain towards Gwadur, (see paragraph 27 below), or, the air Route to India and beyond. If the Rout, in this area were out by any of the hostile activities already indict, ed in paragraph 13 (2) above, aircraft, unless exceptionally long ranged, would find difficulty in maxing Bahrain-Gwadur in one flight* (3) Air facilities on the Trucial Coast are as follows I- Yas Island.

Xhe queetion has to be considered what - if any - further measures are worth while or practioa le to protect Sharjah (and Debai) against the attacks indicated in paragraph 13 (2) above : 25. MUSCAT.

The Oman is to the number of some 3000 advanced on Muttra and Muscat in 1916, but were repelled with heavy loss ty the British force a few miles distant from Muttra. It is possible to argue that as in the case of Bushire ,(see para- grsp h 8 (2) above), it would nave been better to have evacuated Muscat, tins freeing the force for other war areas. (2) However this may be, the following question has to be considered# In the event of a major war, should a similar situation arise, i.e. should the usanis make a threat on /- 20 - on Muscat which cannot be met by the Muscat Levies, are troops and/or Rqyal Air Force to be despatched to repel the attack, or is Muscat to be evacuated ? If troops are to be sent then similar questions arise as for Bushire, (see paragraph 8(3) above). (3) The position of the bultan vis a vis the Cfcaanis of the interior is much the sane as it was twenty years ago i.e. the Sultan holds the cooast and the Onanis the hinter land. Relations between the two parties are, however, more amicable now than they were formerly by reason of an agree, ment come to between them in 1920 by which (roughly) the Sultan recognises the de facto independence of the uaanis, while the latter pay him certain dues. At the same time if circumstances were favourable to the Gaanis it is quite possible that they might again threaten Muscat (4) In addition to the question proposed in paragraph (3) above, there is the further one of whether our interests in Muscat warrant any special measures oeing prepareo. to ward off attacks from sea or by air ? Muscat being outside the Oulf is of oourse more exposed to such attacks than States situated inside it. 27. Gwadur, though situated on the Indian coast, and forming an enclave in the Kalat State, is part oi Muscat territory. Here there art the follbwing * (a) A British Agmt. An Lu ian Official who works under the Political Agent, Muscat. (b) A colony of British Indian subjects to the number of about 1000. (c) Under arrangement between His Majesty’s Gkw ernment and the Sultan the following facilities for Imperial Airways and the Royal Air Force have been acquired! an aerodrome seme 12 miles inland with w/T and U/7, as well as facilities for flying boats in the harbour. Air France and K.L.M. also have pezmission from the Sultan to use the landing ground, (see paragraph 2 (4) above). U)/21 - (d) A Post and Telegraph Office of tne Indian acw in- ment. (2). Owadur unliice Muscat is not exposec to tne clanger of attack from inland, and perdapa tne question of sena^s troops to defend It can be ruled out ? Uke muscat, dowerer, it is exposed to the chance of attack (whaterer this chance may be) by air, and sea. In view of our interest at this place 1 S it worth considering the possibility of defence against such an attack ? 28* One feature of seme importance in tne event of a major war is the extent of Muscat territoiy in Arabia, from Kalba, on the eaet'of the Has ttusandam reninsula, to j,k i ar, about half-way betwean Muscat and Aden, a chaet line oi some 1000 miles, which tax lies on the flank of cur tank.r route from the Gulf, and of our main shipping routes from tne had gea to Karachi and Bombay. Whether thla coast line would offer aw temporary base for a hoe tile submarine or cruiser is of course a technical question « on which I can gire no opinion.

Sir Trenchard Fowle opened the discussion by giving a brief explanation of the reasons why he had thought it necessary to raise the matter at this stage, and there then followed a general discussion in regard to the following points. (1) Bushir e. Sir Trenchard said that it seemed desirable to decide, in advance, what action we should take in the event of a major emergency, i.e. whether we should send reinforcements or evacuate. The War Office representative thought that with heavy calls elsewhere it would be extremely difficult in the early stages to spare troops for Bushire. Colonel Bunbury agreed with this view. The2 . Admiralty and Air Force representatives said that they were not in favour of having any commitments at Bushire. Provisional conclusion . It was unnecessary to prepare plans for sending armed forces to Bushire. (2) Ganoweh - M i shun - G-ach Qaragnuli . This area is not included in the ’Zhadan' scheme and the forces scheduled for the defence of the Abadan area would not be large enough to include the Ganoweh area. Provisione: . 1 Gon elu sion . -xS things stand at present it is unnecessary to prepare a scheme for the Ganoweh area. (3) Lingah - Jash - C harbar . It was agreed that no importance need be attached to these places and that they could be abandoned in the event of an emergency. (4) Bandar Abba s. Here again it was agreed that we had no important interest to protect and that the place could be abandoned. (5) ,-^rab side of t he Pe rsian Gulf . dir Trenchard Powle emphasised the importance of protecting (a) present and future oil interests and (b) the air route. The ---ir anistry representative said that responsibility for the defence of the whole of the Arab side of the Gulf rested on the A.O.G.j Iraq. It was generally agreed that the chief danger of attack would come from wandering tribes and that it was unnecessary to provide against major intervention. Captain Edelston stated that the Admiralty attached considerable importance to adequate measures being taken to prevent acts of sabotage./3. sabotage. (6) Koweit. The meeting was of opinion that consideration should be given to the question of keeping a reasonable store of arms, perhaps in Iraq in reserve and to the drawing up of a scheme for the rapid expansion of the existing forces at the Sheikh’s disposal. Sir Trenchard ‘owle did not think that the Sheikh would be prepared to give any financial assistance though no doubt he would be quite willing to co-operate in other ways. (7) Bahr ein. As Bahrein is an island the chief danger would come from the sea. Captain ffdelston thought, however, that from its geographical position attack by surface ship was remote and the possibility of an enemy aircraft carrier operating in these waters was extremely unlikely. The existing scheme for the ITaval protection of the Gulf was considered adequate to deal with an enemy submarine and possible minelaying. The Air Ministry representative said that except for attack from Persia, Bahrein could be regarded as immune from air attack. The danger from such attack from Saudi Arabia was remote. This also applied to Massawa. Sir Trenchard Fowle said that from his point of view one question on which he would like an answer was whether any further land defences were/4 . $ i/ere necessary. Captain Edelston said that shore 'batteries were not recommended 'by the Naval authorities and he did not think that they were necessary. Che Air Ministry and ,7ar Office representatives agreed. Major Mallahy said that in any case it was extremely unlikely that A.A. guns could 'be supplied for a very long time. Sir Trenchard Powle said he thought that it would 'be possible to raise locally a sufficient force to guard the aerodromes ? oil fields, etc., but expert advice would be needed. A reserve stock of arms etc. might also be desirable and at Sir Trenchard Powle’s suggestion it was agreed to be desirable that an officer (perhaps deputed by the A.O.C., Iraq) should be sent to Bahrein to investigate the position and to formulate a scheme. Sir Trenchard Powle said that he thought that the Sheikh might be willing to help in the purchase of arms and provide storage facilities; he might also be willing to contribute towards the cost of the guards. (8) Qatar . It was agreed that in present circumstances no special defence measures were required though guards would be necessary to protect the oil field, if oil is discovered. It was agreed that the question of forming a local defence force would fall within the sphere of the A.O.C., Iraq. Sir Trenchard Powle said he did not think that the Ruler would be prepared to contribute anything. (9) Trucial Coast . The chief problem here was the defence of landing/Internal landing grounds etc. on the air route, security measures would be required at Shargah and Debai and it was agreed that a scheme should be worked out between the Political Resident and the A. 0. C. , Iraq. (10) Musca t. Sir Trenchard Powle pointed out that during the Great \7ar we had sent a large force to help the Sultan to repel an attack from the Omanis of the interior; and he thought that a decision as to whether assistance should be given in the event of a siitllar attack during a future emergency should be arrived at. The Air Ministry representative said that under present circumstances they would like to see Muscat kept free from disorder. The Y/ar Office representative pointed out that this might only be possible if troops were available and that what seemed required was to have a store of arms and ammunition available for use in an emergency. It was agreed that the question of forming a scheme, in cooperation with the 3ultan, for the expansion of the local force in the event of an emergency should be considered and Sir Trenchard Powle suggested that a Service expert should be sent to Muscat for this purpose. In reply to Sir Trenchard Powle the Admiralty and Air Ministry representatives sta.ted that there was no real danger of attack by sea or air and that it was unlikely i that the Muscat coasts would be used for shelter / by enemy craft. (Intld. ) ^.G. 3.3. India Office 14th .npril, 1936Mr Feel. Re the informal interdepartmental meeting held on the 14th April on the subject of the defence of the Persian Gulf in the event of a major war. 2. I think the meeting was a very useful one and elicited a number of important opinions, subject of course to these opinions being confirmed by the various higher authorities concerned. 3. The most important provisional conclusions were the following general ones:- (a) (see para. 20 (2) of my Note enclosed with my letter No.C.14 of 18th January last to the India Office). That in the opinion of the Admiralty .the contingency of a hostile cruiserVomrinin j Gulf in time of war was so remote that it need not be considered. (This covered the possibility of a cruiser bombarding Muscat and also, subject to further investigation, the possibility of a cruiser or submarine using the Muscati coast between Has Musanaum and Salala as a temporary base (see para. 28 of my Rote)). The Admiralty considered, however, that a raider (disguised merchant vessel) or large submarine might attempt to enter the Gulf, but that such craft could be dealt with by the sloops of the Persian Gulf division. (b) (see para. 2 (3) of my Note) That in the opinion of the Air Ministry tiie Gulf was so remote from the bases of our potential enemies that the possibility of air attacm could be/be ruled out. The only exception to this was if hostile bases were established in Persia. 4. It followed from the above that in the opinion of the Admiralty and the Air Ministry no defences need be organised in the Gulf against naval or air attacks. This, combined with the decision not to send troops to either the Persian or Arab side of the Gulf (see paras 5 (d) and (e) and para. 6 below), clears the ground enormously and only leaves us with schemes of defence and internal security to be organised locally (see paras. 7 to 11 below). I had thought (vine para. 3 of my letter of 18th January) that some at least of the queries contained in my Note answered themselves in the negative, but it is a distinct advantage to have had those dealing with the possibilities of naval and air attack answered now by the competent authorities. As we all know problems assume a different aspect when considered quietly in peacetime from that which they take on in the stress of war. If, for instance, the problem of the defence of Bushire had been considered before the Great War at some such meeting as we have now had, it is difficult to believe that the mistake (in my opinion) would have been made of tying up a whole division there to deal with Wassmuss and his Persian tribesmen. 5. The other provisional conclusions were as follows:- (c) (see para. 7 of my Note). The Gano we n-Mi shun - Gach Q.a ra gnu 1 i area was not included in the Abauan aefenoe scheme, and it was doubtful whether it would be possible to draw up any scheme for its defence. (d) (see para. 8 of my Note). Bushire. It was agreed that no troops could be sent/8 ./ 3. sent to Bushire to meet the threat of attack, and if this threat proved serious enough the only step was evacuation. (e) (see paras. 9 to 10 of my Note). The other small Gulf ports . The same conclusion was come to as for Bushire. 6 # To turn to the Arab side. The general conclusion come to was that in view of the heavy commitments v/hich would fall on our troops in other areas in a major war there would be none to spare to send to the Arab states. These included Muscat. 7 . To consider the Arab States one by one. Koweit . (see paras. 16 to 17 of my Note). The suggestion made in para. 17 (3) of my Note to the effect that the Sheikh might be encouraged to assist in his cm defence was generally approved of. I pointed out that owing to the recent finding oi oil at Koweit, though in what quantities was not yet certain, the problem of Koweit defence was now both more important and more difficult as the oilfields, if these materialised, would be at some distance from the town and thus be open to sabotage by Bedouin, especially if in the meantime Ibn Saud * 1 s strong control had been removed by his death. I said I would be glad to have the assistance and expert advice of an officer for drawing up a scheme of local defence. The Air Ministry suggested that, since the Air Officer Commanding Iraq was resjjonsible for the defence by land of the Arab side, such an officer might well be detailed by him subject of course to his views. This would suit me admirably.8. Bahrein . (see paras. 13 to 21 of my Note). Here of course, uniiHo at Nov/eitthere is no question of a land attach on Bahrein. On the other hand v/e have an oilfield and refinery which lend themselves to internal sabotage from enemy agents (see para. 21 (1) of my Note). The Admiralty representative emphasized that it was this kind of hostile activity of which the Admiralty were especially apprehensive. Here again I would be glad of the services of an officer from the Air Officer Commanding to assist in considering a scheme of internal security. I have no doubt whatever that the Bahrein Petroleum Company would co-operate wholeheartedly in any such scheme. 9. Qatar . (see para. 22 of my Note). If the Air Officer Commanding Iraq desires any scheme of co-operation with the Sheikh to be considered I shall of course be very pleased to assist. At present the Petroleum Concessions Limited are merely carrying out exploratory drilling. If, however, they strike oil then the same problems of local defence for an oilfield will arise as at Koweit. The Trucial Coast . (see paras. 23 to 24 of my Note) A scheme for the local defence of Sharjah was worked out some years ago by the Air Officer Commanding Iraq and myself. Perhaps this scheme might now be overhauled to see if it needs amendments. At the meeting the question of the local defence of Lebai was also raised. This could likewise be gone into by the Air Officer Commanding and myself. 11. Muscat . (see paras. 25 to 27 of my Note). The Air Ministry representative gave the opinion that Muscat was of importance from the R.A.F. point of view since/5. since it was an important station on the A&amp;en-Muscat- Karachi route. With regard to considering a scheme of local defence against a possible incursion of the Omanis, it was suggested that the A.O.G. Iraq might detail an officer for this purpose. Naturally the co-operation of the Sultan would have to be secured but as such a scheme would be in his interest I do not anticipate difficulties in this direction. 12* Oil* (1) On this subject I cannot help feeling that the undoubted importance of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's oil supply at Abadan has perhaps somewhat overshadowed the importance both actual and potential of oil on the Arab coast. Looking into the future it is by no means fantastic to envisage a series of oilfields, each perhaps as large as the one at Bahrein, stretching from Koweit to Muscat. In this case the Arab coast would become one of the largest oil producing’areas in the world, an area moreover - and this is the essential factor from the strategical point of view - under our control. The great disadvantage of course of the Abadan supply is that it lies in a foreign country by no means under our control. Even the present situation with a large oilfield at Bahrein ana at least fair prospects of two others at Koweit and Hasa (where oil has been found recently) is of considerable significance (A Hasa oilfield would be in Saudi territory, but since by reason of the geographical position of Hasa transport to the outer world could not be effected during a major war without our sanction, doubtless some arrangement as to pre-emption rights of purchase could be come to). (2) I emphasized at the meeting and in my Note (see para.14 (2)) a point which appears to me personally of great/o. great importance. In case of danger to the Abacan oil works a scheme would he jjut into effect for sending a force there to guard them. Before, however, this force can arrive and function a period must elapse. During this period it may he that no oil will he forthcoming and in any case, as I understand it, the scheme does not cover the protection of the 150 miles or so of pipe line from the oilfields to Abaaan. It is possible, therefore, that in the event of a major war, for a time our only supply of oil from the Gulf will be from the Arab side. This contingency obviously greatly increases the importance of oil on that side and especially as things stand at present at Bahrein. Among other considerations it would seem essential that arrangements should be made with the Bahrein Petroleum Company for a supply of fuel up to naval and R.A.F. standards. At present sloops of the Persian Gulf division still have to go from their base at Bahrein to Abadan to obtain their fuel supply. I understand, however, that conversations are proceeding between the Admiralty and the Bahrein Petroleum Company on the subject of a local fuel supply. In this connection the following extract from a letter from Mr. Weightman, the Political Resident, Bahrein, who is acting as Political Resident, received by me to-day, is of interest 'There is a very strong pro-British feeling among the higher command at Bapco which has oeen even more noticeable lately since the arrival of Mr. Tnornbei their Vice President. He has, on various occasions, remarked that the Company realise that they depend entirely on British protection against any possible aggression and it seems that they are genuinely anxious to do wn&amp;o Miey can/7. can to help. An obvious direction is in the supply of fuel for His Majesty’s ships and R.A.P. and Imperial Airways aircraft at Bahrain, and I have the most definite assurances that they would produce the required fuel in a very short time if it were wanted. The hint has also been uropped to me that existing contracts need not be regarded as an insuperable bar. He tells me that it is by no means uncommon for one oil company to take over part of another's contract, and that Bapco would 'fix it' with A.I.O.C., with whom they are on excellent terms. There may, of course be a certain amount of American bluff about this, but I must confess I don't think there is very much. After all the amount of the fuel used by the sloops or by R.A.F. and Imperial Airways machines at Bahrain is not so very great, and as a purely business proposition I doubt if it would be attractive. On the other hand the advantages from our point of view seem fairly considerable. We should have a reserve source of oil supply for H.M. T s Forces in existence ready for war. In peace it means increased mobility for the sloops; it means a saving on R.A.F. supplies (which pay Bahrain customs); and it means the end of friction over Imperial Airways refund of customs. 11 I will be grateful if you would circulate this Note to the Departments concerned. I am keeping a copy for my own reference. (Sgd.) T. C. Fowle. 19th April, 1938.p # z.3128/1933. AIR MINISTRY, SECRET^ S.40564. Adastral House, Kin^sway, W.C.2. 3rd May 1938. Dear Peel, I have no comments to make on the minutes of the discussion which we had concerning the appropriate defence measures to be undertaken in the Persian Gulf. I do dot intend to send a complete copy of the minutes to the A.O.C. Iraq, and I think it will be sufucient to send him a resume of the Conclusions to which we agreed. I intend to inform him that the possibility of any commitments (apart from the defence scheme of the Anglo- Iranian oil fields) on the eastern sidejof the Persian Gulf is most remote. On the western side the threat of any attack from the sea or from the air is slight and we would not at present be justified in making any provision for fixed defences against sea or air attack. Our immediate aim should be to develop whatever local resources there are in order to offset the possibility of tribal attack from the landward side, and of sabotage both in the Bahrain oil fields and at those places which are staging points on the Iraq-India and Iraq-Aden air routes. I also propose to tell the A.O.C. that we are asking, him tolsend an officer to assist in drawing up defence plans Tor Kuwait, Bahrain, Sharjah and Muscat. It is obviously desirable that this officer's visit to the Gulf should take place after Sir Trenchard Fowle's return. We will therefore tell the A.O.C. that he may expect in the course of time to le ar from the R.P.G. suggesting arrangements by which collaboration on drawing up defence plans for the places mentioned can best be achieved. Perhaps you will be good enough to inform Sir Trenchard Fowle of the action we propose to take. Yours sincerely, Sd. W.A.Coryton. R.T.Peel, Esq., M.C.

Note for Political Resident on dlscui with Major Price on his visit to Muscat in connection with the proposed scheme for defence of the Gulf. 1. Major Price accompanied by Wing Commander Jope Slade f Royal Air Force of the Intelligence Branch Air Headquarters, Iraq visited Muscat from January 18th to 21st. They had a discussion with me in the Agency on January 19th in which I gave them the information they asked for on such matters as strength and composition of the State Forces, lines of approach to Muscat from the interior, general political situation in the State with particular reference to the Oman, details of the landing grounds and other facilities accorded to the Royal Air Force by the Sultan. 2. Major Price stated that from the information supplied him of the local situation he was very definitely of the opinion that the best method of ensuring an effective contribution from Muscat State in any scheme of co-operation for the Defence of the Gulf that its Government might be willing to participate in, would be to improve and strengthen the existing defence arrangements and to endeavour to arrange after consultation with the military authorities in India that a battalion of the Indian! Army should be earmarked for rapid despatch to Muscat should the position after the outbreak of war threaten to develop into such a serious situation as to be beyond the capabilities of the State Forces to cope with unaided.- 2 - 3* As examples of methods for improving the efficiency of the Levy Major Price mentioned the following which he was considering recommending in hie report. (a) Periodic visits to Muscat of a British &amp;«wboT Officer who, it was proposed, should be stationed with his Headquarters at Bahrain, and give short instructional and ’•refresher*' courses to the Officers and N.C.O's of the State Forces at Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait particularly in connection with the training of detachments in Machine, Light automatic Guns and Trench Mortars. (b) Provisions of two or more of the latest type of Trench Mortars for the Muscat Levy. This weapon in Major Price's opinion, as a result of recent developments^is particularly well adapted to deal with the type of gx iighting which would probably result from attacks on Muscat by the tribes of the interior. (c) Increased allowance of S«A.A. for machine Gun and rifle practice. (d) Increased allowance of 3 Pounder ammunition for practice firing with the Hotchhiss Guns owned by the State. 4. As regards items (b), (c) and (d) mentioned above I pointed out that the great difficulty to be overcome would be that of the expense as the State Finances were not such that any appreciable extra burden could be imposed on them# Major Price said that without of course committing himself in any way, he thought it might be possible provided his scheme were sanctioned, that the Military authorities might be able to defray the cost of these items.If Dais could 'be arranged I have no doubt the Sultan would be very glad to accept such valuable contributions to the defence of his State* 5. Major Price informed me that he was proceeding next day to inspect the landing ground at Rass-al- Hadd with a view to ascertaining if it were suitable for the latest type of fast^range bomber aeroplane which due to its high landing speed could not use the landing ground at Muscat. According to Major Price on account of its geographical position Rass- al-Hadd occupies an important place in the strategic air route to the East. g # In view of the Sultan's attitude to co*opera» ting in any scheme of defence for the Gulf (vide my Express letter C/162 dated 12th Hovember 1938) I did not arrange an interview for Major Price with him as in any case the hatter's suggestions for Muscat would of course have to be approved of by you before approaching His Highness on the matter. 7. Major Price mentioned that as the Report he was compiling had to embrace the whole of the Arab side of the Gulf it would be necessary for him to visit all the important places therein and conse quently he did not expect to be able to complete it in less than* about 6 weeks. Copies of the Report would, he added, of course be sent to the Political Resident for his remarks and to the Political Agents concerned.CONFIDENTIAL.

Muscat and Mattra are enclosed on the land side by precipitous rocky hills and can only be approached along definite traces which are as follows*.- (a) The main route from the Hinterland. This leads in past the landing ground to Mattra and then winds along the edge of the sea and over a pass into Muscat town. (b) A track which leads North from Mattra along the , Batineh Coast as far as Shinas. This^'ln^pTaces had and would require a considerable amount of work being carried out before it could be used for regular heavy traffic. (o) X track which leads South from a point about 1 mile North of the Landing ground via Hajjar to Sur and can be used with some difficulty by light motor traffic as far as (^uriyat, a village some 60 miles from Sur. The only other way to approach Muscat by land is by climbing over the precipitous hills by goat tracKs. 9. The country in general is quite unsuitalbe for the use of armoured cars or mechanical transport except that cars and light trucks could oe employed alon&amp; the tracks as given in paragraph 8 above. Mechanical transport could also be employed to transport troops quickly from Muscat to Mattra and the landing ground area.

I pointed out to Hi. *ajeety’e Govern ment, that auoh coneiaeration should take place now end not on the outbreak of war. His Majesty's Government have agreed and the soheme is for olltioal Ag«t» t0 approach Rulers verbally on the following lines. That in the event of war the Resident would issue cert in 1-ci-.u ret, Jinti affecting person, under his jurisdiction and that it would be essential for the Rulers to issue oorreeponding ^lans to deal with person, under their Juriediction. That it was desirable for the Rulers to have the actual '-e* 1 ij1 aj '- h u.,.s drawn up confidentially beforehand, so that in an / emergencyemergency they coald be published immediately. In the mean time of coume such Alans would be kept etrictly confidential 6 # It may be that the Rulers will hesitate at accepting some of the provisions of the draft Alan amongst which will be the death penalty correepondin*; to paragraph 2 of the Kotioe. If they take up this attitude it should be explained to them that as a deterrent it is essential that publicity should be given to the death penalty, and that whetner this is actually carried out will depend on tne Rulery discretion. It can further be emphasised to them that all the provisions of the Alan would apply only for the duration of the war. I hope to be able to send you a draft Alan by this 7 mail, if there is time to oatoh it, or by next mail. In the meantime you need take no action. B.

The town of MUSCAT is situated on the coast ox 'Sastern HAJAH in the Arabian peninsular. It is surrounded on the land side by mountainous and precipitous country taroudi which there is only one route of approach from the hinterland. This route first passes through the town of '^lATTFm., a. suburb of MUSCAT, one mile North .of MUSCaT on the coast. 2. MUSCAT is ruled over by a Sul ten v/ho. controls a strip along the Arabian coast from SEINaS in Western EAJAa to SaLaLa in the province of uih'FaU.^ on the Southern coast of Arabia. He also controls the anchor ge of IHiCH QlYMJ a t the Nortbiern*extremity of the TRUCIaL COaST and Gr’.itDUH on the Southern coast of EaLUCHISTaN near the her si an frontier. His authority, except in the province of DhCFAH, is confined to a narrow coastal strip and it is somewhat loose over the area between MUSCAT and SUE just North of HAS iiL HaDD. 3, The importance of MUSCaT from the Defence point of view to the British Empire is derived from the following (a) Its position along the air route from t IRaQ (and INDIA) to ADEf and the control held by the'' Sultan over the various H.A.F. landing grounds between SHINaS and SaLaLa, (b) Its position as a landing point for^ cables between IlTDIA and BUSHIi^, -and its importance as cable station. The Cable and ire less Company hope shortly to also erect a wireless station* The fact tin t there is a R.A.g. in the town., and that tcie H. a.F • store ?,t Aie 1 anding ground.

MUSCAT and LIATTI-d. are enclosed on the land side by precipitous rocky hills and can only be approached along definite tracks which are as’‘follows: - (a) ( c ) The main route from the Hinterland. This leads in past the landing ground to HATTHA and then winds along the edge of the sea and over a pass into MUSCAT town. A track which leads north from MATTHA along the BAT INEH Coast to SO HAH and beyond. This is indifferent in places and would reauire repairs before it could oe usea fox regular heavy traffic. A track which leads South from MUSCAT via _HAJJAH towards SUH and is suitable for light motor traffic.

It might even avoid the expense of having to reinforce the 1IUSCAT Levies from INDIA except in a General Tribal rising. 18. The best course would therefore appear to he to re-equip the IyIUSCAT Levies at Great Britain’s expense and to provide free courses for IT.C.O’s in IITDIA. The moral effect of this alone would probably be sufficient to prevent any minor unrest among the local tribes. HSCOil.E HDED PLAN. 19.

I From Captain T. Hioicinbotham, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M 1 s Consul, Muscat. To The Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I hare the honour to refer to my letter No# C/83 dated the 8th May 1939 and to enclose a report on His Highness the Sultans reactions to the 'Alan*, which in accordance with your instructions and as previously reported I showed him on the 6th of May 1939. 2. I think it desirable to place on record that my interviews with His Highness the Sultan on the 6th and 13th of May were most friendly. Prom his attitude it appeared that he took it for granted that his State would either remain neutral or be actively engaged on the side of His Majesty’s Government. I did not consider it desirable to question him closely on the exact import of the statement that I have recorded at the end of paragraph 3 of my note on the interview on the 13th May. I think that it should be taken that he was probably referring to the possibility of his considering it necessary to remain neutral and not as an indication that he contemplated further foreign alliances although he might make use of his liberty of action in this / respect to2 - respect to persuade His Majesty's Government to grant him the protection he is obviously anxious to have. I wish to offer one or two comments on His Highness's attitude i• (a) I consider that His Highness is justified in requiring an undertaking of protection during the course of the actual hostilities both from disaffected subjects as well as from external aggression by a foreign power. The condition of Oman makes it highly probable, that, even though not encouraged by paid agents 9 certain of the more discontented and disaffected elements in the country will take the first opportunity to cause inconvenience to their Ruler. f (b) His desire for protection after hostilities have ceased is probably the result of his knowledge of the fate which in the past has overtaken certain rulers who actively assisted His Majesty's Government during the late war and whose states have now been obsorbed by more powerful countries inspite of wartime undertakings. (c) It is undoubtedly in the interests of His Majesty's Government to maintain friendly relations with Muscat and Oman and for this purpose it is essential to have a friendly ruler in authority. The present ruler is most friendly and is a man of considerable intelligence. His Highness hopes to obtain all the benefits of complete protection without making any of the usual concessions. 1 think it would be undesirable to guarantee full protect ion without certain concessions in return and I suggest that in return for His Majesty's Government's protection / the Sultanthe Sultan should he required to place the control of hie relatione with foreign powers in the hands of His Hajesty’s GoTerament. Any undertaking given in this respect should he binding on his heirs and successors. The opportunity should also he taken to insist on some measure of internal control designed to improve the present political and financial situation. It only requires the energy and enterprise of a British adviser or minister to bring about considerable improvement in the condition of the country and the welfare of the people. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Captain,1.A Political Agent &amp; H.B.M* s Consul, Muscat.Note on *n interview between Hie Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Captain T. Hiokinbotham, O.B.jB., held at the Agenoy Muscat on May the 13th # 1939. His Highness the Sultan called at the Agency this morning and discussed his position in the event of hostilities occuring,and tne publication of the 'Alan*. I promised that I would inform the Hon*ble the Political Resident of the views he expressed during the interview. 2. The Sultan started by saying that he had already discussed the question with the Hon’ble the Political Resident on his last visit to Muscat. He then proceeded to state his view oh his position. He considered that the issue by him of the '’Alan' would mean that he had renounced his neutrality and had in effect become an ally of Great Britain against a common enemy. This renouncement of his neutrality might, and probably would, result in he and his people becoming subject to risks affecting life and property which they would not have been subject to had the State remained neutral. That it was his duty to his people to ensure that such protection as was possible in the circumstances was forthcoming^ and therefore he must ask for protection before agreeing to take an action which would rightly be construed as terminating his neutrality. Hie made it clear that this protection must be of two kinds. Jirstly^ protection from external aggression whether against actual naval or air bases being used by His Majesty’s Government or against locals centres which might be subjected to enemy action either by reason of their military importance or in retaliation for the assistance he / was giving2 - -»• 14? stTi wa» giving to His Majesty’s OoTernment, Secondly protection against internal disturbances. He considered this second requirement essential as his country was by no means a civilised one and the excuse that he was involving his country in a war at the request of His Majesty’s Government might be used by disaffected persons to foment trouble in the interior of Oman. He stated that the more ignorant of his subjects would not understand the reasons for involving the country in a war which did not appear to directly affect them. 3* His Highness the Sultan then passed on to the question of his position after hostilities had ceased. He seemed to think that he might find himself attacked or liable to attach for the part he had played during the war. He had no desire to find himself without the support of His Majesty’s Government during the unsettled period which experience had shown followed the termination of a major war. He would therefore require an undertaking of protection even after hostilities had ceased. In his opinion there would still be the possibility of internal unrest and the under taking should therefore relate to movements directed against his authority from both external and internal sources. He stated that he was not asking for his territories to be formed into a British Protectorate but rather for protection. His Highness the Sultan added that in the event of His Majesty's Government being unwilling to safeguard his Interests he might consider it desirable in the interests of his State to take such other action as might be possible to ensure the welfare of his country. 4. His Highness the Sultan then passed on to the / actualactual '\lan' # He raieed rarious ainor o^Jeotlons to Indiyidual clauses and the preanible such as disliking the words -under the Jurisdiction of the Muscat and Oman Goyerninant* and prefering the phrase 'to all people'. In addition to the indiyidual clauses to which he raised objection he disapproved of the general form of the 'Alan'. He thought that it would look too like foreign dictation if he published an 'Alan' modelled on the Defence Regulations which would have reference to British Subjects and with which it was intended that his 'Alan' should be simultaneously published. His Highness stated that his subjects would resent what might look to them like dictation by a foreign power. He would prefer in the event of the necessary guarantees being forthcoming, to issue a general 'Alan' informing his people that a state of war existed between His Majesty*• Government and a specific country or countries and that he,in view of his friendship for Great Britain, had decided to give all possible assistance to His Majesty’s Government. That any person who in any way assisted the enemy»i.e. the specified country or countries, or acted against the interests of Great Britain or the State of Muscat and Oman would be severely punished. He preferred to leave the punishment unspecified as for religeous reasons certain punishments might be unsuitable for certain offences In fact he pro^ojed to inform his subjects of his Intention to make use of his unlimited powers in the furtherance of the common object of Great Britain,and Muscat and Oman. He considered that individual orders on specially complicated points could if necessary be issued later.Telegram S. \ From Politi cal Resident, To Political, Muscat. No. T/99.

Although, as explained in my letter quoted above, we could use the Sultan’s territory even though he remained neutral it would nevertheless be an advantage if he were formally on our aide, for example, in dealing with enemy Agents (and in this connection it must be remembered that all foreigners except British subjects and british protected per sons are under the jurisdiction of the Sultan), and in seizing enemy merchant shipping, if any such took refuge in Muscat and Mattrah. 'Ihere may be objections against giving the Sultan the guarantee he asks for. in this case an alternative inducement to declare himself formally on our side might take the form of a monthly subsidy for the duration of the wars I would suggest a sum of Rs*10*000 (about £ 670/-) a month. In arriving at this sum I have had in mind that the Sultan has been accustomed until lately to receiving an Arms traffic; subsidy of Rs.100,000 a year. *************************</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00009f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/384</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00009f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/384</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 11/34 I Defence and War Subsidy'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1937/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-09-06T22:16:56</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (160 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 162; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
