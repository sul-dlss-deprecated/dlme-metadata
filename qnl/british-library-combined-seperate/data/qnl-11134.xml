The memorandum goes on to describe the French Government's agreement to withdraw the concession, as it contravened a Treaty of 1862 in which the Sultan pledged not to lease any part of his territory to either Power, and notes the French Government's continuing desire to establish a coaling station on the same terms as the British. The memorandum concludes with a quotation from
                           The Timesnewspaper, reproducing a statement in the House of Commons regarding the events. The memorandum is written by Sir William Lee-Warner.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of France, Third Republic</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>The Times, British newspaper</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">publisher</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Muskat</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Land tenure</topic></subject><subject><topic>Coaling-stations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000146#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000146#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
