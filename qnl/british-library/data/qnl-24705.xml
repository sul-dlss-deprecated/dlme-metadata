IN my despatch No. 113 of the 22nd May last I had the honour to inform your Lordship that I proposed, after my contemplated visit to Meshed, to report more fully to your Lordship than I then felt able to do, on the question of the maintenance there of a Military Attache. I have satisfied myself from what 1 have seen of the work here that it is impossible for the duties now devolving upon Captain Smyth to he properly performed either by the Consul-General or by the Indian * c Political Attache,” who acts as the latter’s Oriental and Diplomatic Secretary. The business of the Consulate-General at Meshed is very heavy: its mere regular routine, the Indian accounts, the requirements of the Consular guard of sowars, the work in connection with the upkeep of its extensive buildings, and the ordinary correspondence on current matters, such as the every day cases and affairs of the British Indian Colony and pilgrims, not to speak of Afghan and other proteges, both with the Persian authorities and the Government of India, quite apart from the Political and Intelligence Deports, keep the ordinary staff busy from 9 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m. every day, longish hours in an eastern climate, and it is rare that they have a whole holiday on Sunday, though since Major Sykes has been in charge he has endeavoured to arrange that their Sunday work should terminate by noon. The political work, properly so-called, at so important a post of observation and centre of Russian activity as Meshed, absorbs all the time which the Consul-General can spare after the supervision of the routine business above described, and much of it is done by the Indian Attache, who has to keep in close and regular touch by personal intercourse with the Governor-General, the Shrine officials and other local authorities, and to manage under the Consul-General s orders the Persian Political, as distinct from the Military and Russian Secret Service Department. I have no hesitation in saving, from what I have seen here, that as the work increases, moie, rather than less,‘assistance is required by the Consul-General, and that it would be impossible for him to combine with his present duties the efficient discharge of those now performed by the Military Attache. # 4, The question which has therefore to be considered is whether, especially now that the political situation in Asia, which existed when I last had the honour to address your Lordship on the subject, has been modified by the conclusion of peace between Russia and Japan, it is necessary to maintain at Meshed an Intelligence Department for Central Asia. I am inclined to answer tins question in the affirmative, at any rate for the immediate present. It is possible that the most important part of the work, which is now done by the Military Attache here may, at no distant date, be performed by a British Consul at Tashkend. I believe that the appointment of such an officer has been for some time past under consideration, and that the Russian Government have not refused it in principle, though taey lave a ac icc certain conditions to it. It could obviously not well be opened at res h so long as t _ie Japanese war was raging, but if the conclusion of peace is followed by a detente m the relations of tluAwo Powers in the Middle East, it might perhaps be advan tageously rediscussed. A British Consul at lashkend, vho won presuma } je a military officer, would be able, without depending upon the reports of spies, whom, as he would be verv closely watched at least at first, he Mould ha\o o c \ery care u about, employing, to furnish much of the information as to t le s ren^, '■ a q ments of the Russian troops and other military matters m Central Asia ioi which the Government of India and Intelligence Department must now largely re^ on news supplied from Meshed. Until, however, we have not merely obtained fiom Russian Government the recognition of a British Consul at/lashkend o! elsewhere m Central Asia (I have merely suggested Tashkend as the capital of luikcstan and a point more or less equi-distant from the Persian, Afghan Myp‘&gt; me se tenitoies), have tested by a year or so’s experience the practical possibilities ol obtaining «nou 0 &lt;3:him all the political and military intelligence, secret as well as easily accessible, winch we require f am strongly of opinion that it would be wise to adhere to the plan of retaining the Consulate General at Meshed as the head-quarters for our becret Intelligence Department in Central Asia. There are many reasons which lead me to this conclusion:— 1. At Meshed, under the apathetic and_ not unfriendly rule of Persia it is possible to carry on Secret Service operations with a security which could not exist at any place within Russian territory. 1 . ., , 2. Both as a large centre of population and as a holy city, constantly swarming with Mahommedan pilsrims from all the countries bordering on India, including Afghanistan and Russian Central Asia, it affords facilities for obtaining Secret Agents without attracting any special attention, and through them establishing relations with informants in those countries, and thus spreading, as Captain Smyth is gradually doing, a network of intelligence officers all over the region from which we desire to obtain news. n t ^ o 0 . 3. The Persians, with all their faults, make on the whole better Secret Service agents than the Afghans or the natives ot India. The latter aie much moic closely watched by the Russians, They are, more especially the Afghans, less wily, and more apt to betray their real character. Their correspondence to us addressed to other Persians living on or near the Khorassan frontier, or in Meshed itself, is less likely to he opened than if they were either Afghan or Rritish subjects, and Captain Smyth informs me that none of the numerous agents employed by him at various centres in Trans-Caspia and Turkestan have, up to the present, been detected by the Russians. The weak point in their intelligence, apart from the w r ant oi absolute accuracy, which is common to all Orientals, is their technical ignorance as to military matters, their inability, for example, to distinguish between the uniforms of different regiments, different kinds of artillery, &amp;c., hut Major Sykes and Captain Smyth believe that this can be, to a great extent, remedied by sending one or two of the abler among them (which can easily be done without exciting observation) to India, where they could get the training necessary to enable them to report in a thoroughly trustworthy fashion upon such matters. If the system at which Captain Smyth has been working for nearly two years with results which may, I think, be regarded as successful, is allowed to develop, I venture to hope that we may before long be in possession, through this Consulate- General, of early and full intelligence on every event of political or military interest occurring in Trans-Caspia, Bokhara, Perghana, and Turkestan. Until, therefore, as I ventured to observe, we are able to obtain such intelligence direct through a regular political officer stationed in Russian Central Asia, it would, I think, he a great mistake to relax our efforts in this direction at Meshed. I would even he inclined to continue to maintain our Intelligence Department here for some little time after the appoint ment of such an officer. It is certain that a British Consul at Tashkend would, during the earlier days of his appointment, be subject to continuous espionage, that no native other than a British Indian having explicable business with his Consulate, could visit him without danger of arrest or deportation, and that nothing would afford the Russian officials in Central Asia more satisfaction than to catch him out employing spies, and thus have a pretext for demanding his removal. It would therefore he necessary for him at first to walk most warily, to confine, himself to reporting those military tacts which he could ascertain in a perfectly above board fashion, and to cultivating cordial personal relations with the officers, both civil and military, with whom he would have to deal. Gradually as these got more used to his presence, he would doubtless he regarded with greater friendship and less suspicion and mi° &gt; ht before very long, if a man of tact, he able to mix as freely with all classes, as is 'the case with our Consular officers at Moscow’, Warsaw^, and other centres of European Russia. When this happened it might he possible to suppress, or greatlv reduce; the activity of the Intelligence Branch here at Meshed. Under present circumstances, I should myself wish to see it strengthened by the appointment of a subaltern officer as an assistant under-study, and locum tenens to Captain Smvth. This w’ould be just as cheap in the long run as bringing, when the Military Attache goes on leave, another officer all the way irom India to replace him, and would be much less likelv to disorganize the rather delicate work he had to do. It would also relieve the Political jN ative Attache of a good deal ot translating and other work which he has now to TlJnh Captam br W th ’ and ^ich takes him away from his own special duties. The above considerations would naturally apply with even greater force if the result %of peace with Japan is to render Russia more aggressive in the Middle East as the line of least resistance to her Asiatic ambitions. As to whether this is likely to happen J. am, of course, not able to express an opinion. 1 have the honour to transmit herewith, for your Lordship’s information, in case it should not have reached you through the India Office, a copy of a despatch addressed on this subject by Colonel Minchin to the Government of India, which will give you a fair idea of the cost and working of the present Military Intelligence Branch at Meshed. Colonel Minchin was, I believe, in favour of Making this Intelligence Branch entirely separate from the Consulate-General, so as to allow Captain bmith to communicate directly and independently with the Intelligence Department at Calcutta, without the Consul-General’s being in any way responsible for his work. J l I do not myself think this idea a good one. It appears to me that the Secret Service work, both Persian and Central Asian, is so closely interdependent that both should centre in the Consul-General, and that the reports of the Military Attache, whether dealing within or beyond the frontiers of Khorassan, should he supervised by the political chief of the Meshed Mission in the same way as are those of a Military Attache at an Embassy or Legation by the Ambassador or Minister in charge of it. Major Sykes, with whom I have discussed this whole question at some length, who concurs in the^ views expressed by me in my despatch No. 113 of the 22nd May, as well as in this despatch, and to whom I am indebted for several suggestions, notably the one which I have put before your Lordship about the training of some of our best informants in India, is addressing the Government of India in much the same sense. 1 understand, however, from him, and I inferred as much from your Lordship’s despatch No. 63, of the 25th April, that the question is not one for the decision of the Government of India alone, but will form the subject of an exchange of views with the Imperial Government which will be called upon to consider what share, if any, should be borne by His Majesty’s Treasury in the maintenance of the Intelligence Branch at Meshed. It is for this reason that I have ventured, in anticipation of your Lordship’s instructions, to enlarge at some length on this subject. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. P.S.—I have the honour to inclose a copy which Major Sykes has just sent me of his report on the above subject to the Government of India. A. H. H. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Minchin to Government of India. (Secret.) Sir, Meshed, February 9, 1905. I HAVE the honour to address you regarding the provision of a separate office establishment and separate Secret Service funds for the Military Attache recently added to the staff of this Consulate-General. The ordinary establishment of news-agents for this agency is three, viz., at Krasnovodsk, Sarakhs, and Merv. Since the outbreak of the present Russo-Japanese war and the appointment of Captain Smyth as Military Attache of this agency, the number has now increased to nine news-writers constantly employed, besides occasional travelling agents in addition. Captain Smyth also employs a man to read the Russian newspapers to him and causes to be translated any portion of them likely to be of interest. The result has been that the greater part of my Political Attache’s time is taken up with arranging the dispatch of news-writers to Trans-Caspia and Russian Turkestan, their transfer from place to place to insure their safety, transmission of money to them, settlement of their accounts, and more especially with the enormous amount of translation work which has now to be done. My Political Attache, who is my right hand man and by far the most important to me of all my office establishment, is gradually being absorbed from his work by the Military Attache, and the political work of the agency not only suffers considerably in consequence, but my own work, already sufficiently heavy, is thereby much7’®” 4 increased, since the Political Attach ^ ’ assisting i^thelork time to do falls largely on me. tmen f t 0 | a Military Attache threatens to given me in the one direction iy PI p l;tical Attach^ in another, be more than neutralized by the loss ot y num ber of Consular cases always on The Political Attache deals 'y* 1 the CustomS; and the Russian hand with the Governor-General, the &lt; o Arrears to the great detriment of Consulate, and these have lately fallen mu an j e ’ s me at the many visits I our traders here. My ^Political Attache ^^^jjedical Officer; he has also to have to pay or receive, he also often ac l^ d .^ persians and ke ep himself perfectly constantly visit and make lr lends u it I ^, ig [ ,. oiu ,, 01l an d last, but by no sx --w«* ,or mr sSr SSSeSStefeWi 11s; ^‘‘ThlTnteliigence work of this agency is just at present of the highest importance and even after the conclusion of the present war is likely to remam so I would ask, therefore, that the Intelligence Branch may be “^ ed \ Military Attache not only with an entirely separate clerk ot his o , separate Sec ^ statei f en t s showing what funds are required m this agency, under tllC ^tatement ~~(A) gives the present establishment of news-agents, the pay they receive, and other expenses incurred for purely Intelligence Branch purposes, me udm a clerk for the Military Attache. The pay of this clerk may seem high but it must he remembered that he has the lives of our news-agents, or most certaml) then liberty, in his hands and must he a picked man and absolutely trustworthy. Statement (B) shows the present expenditure for political purposes. The present combined Secret Service grant for this agency is 14,40 rupees I would ask that from the 1st April, 1905, the following grants may be allotted hut Political Secret Service grant.. Military „ ,, Amount. Rupees. 9,000 12,500 The latter would, I conclude, he found by the Intelligence Branch. Captain Smyth is, I understand, separately addressing the Intelligence Branch as to the individual he would wish to be sent here as his clerk. It is for consideration whether His Britannic Majesty’s Legation at Tehran might not be asked to share the above expenditure. The Legation seem quite willing to place funds for Secret Service purposes at the disposal of the Consul-General here, and though I have not myself asked His Britannic Majesty’s Minister for any money,, the latter placed a sum of 300/. at Lieutenant-Colonel Temple’s disposal in 1901- 1902. I would ask that early orders may kindly be passed on the questions raised above. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) C. P. MINCHIN, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, $;c.6 Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Major Sykes to Government of India. (Secret.) Meshed, September 7, 1905. WITH reference to Colonel Mincliin’s letter dated the 9th February, 1905, to the Government of India, and Sir Arthur Hardinge’s letter dated the -Ind May, 190a, to Lord Lansdowne, I have been awaiting the Minister’s arrival before addressing you on this very important subject. „ ^ -n x t&gt; • ,1 in 2. I consider that Meshed, as the chief town -of North-East Persia, and a holy city visited annually by thousands of pilgrims, is a unique centre^ for spreading a network of intelligence all over Central Asia. I also hold that it is equally unique as a training centre. # . In case of the invasion of India by Russia, which is, after all, the only military problem of first-rate importance which confronts the Government of India, the r61e to he played by the Meshed staff, whether actually at Meshed or not the Russians might occupy the city—would he one of the utmost importance. This is so self-evident that I need not enlarge on it, but will at once come to my point. 3. Briefly I recommend that Meshed should he considered to be a field section of the Intelligence Branch, and that its present scale should be expanded with caution but yet with determination. I hold that Intelligence men should not be trained in India, but should be selected from among our picked agents who have proved their capacity. They could be sent to India for special training and study of the various kinds of armaments, &amp;c., and thus be able to report with certainty whether a battery was composed of siege or field guns and so forth. They would be encouraged while at their posts to become proficient in Russian and the languages of Central Asia. If money was forthcoming for this scheme we should be training men to do the same work in peace as in war, and this is universally acknowledged to be extremely desirable. I think that the results already obtained by Captain Smyth are such as to warrant the presumption that, given a larger budget, still better results may be anticipated. 4. To organize such a corps, and, still more, to secure continuity of working which, in my opinion, is vital in handling such delicate mechanism, I think that an assistant in the shape of an officer in the Intelligence Branch might well be appointed to Meshed. He would, in any case, obtain most valuable training in dealing with all sorts and conditions of Asiatics, not to mention Russians and Belgians. As much of the intelligence work is necessarily of a preparatory nature, surely the milieu of Meshed would be ideal. 5. A translator (on a salary of 150 rupees per mensem, rising to 250 rupees per mensem) should be appointed to this office under the Native Attache. This man would deal with the accounts and translate the numerous letters, besides, of course, assisting in the dispatch of the agents. . 6- In my opinion and that of Captain Smyth, both the Military Attache and the Assistant should be, as is now the case with Captain Smyth, under the orders of the Consul-General. I differ in this from Colonel Minchin, who advocated a separate establishment. Experience is, however, against creating an imperium in imperio, and any separation would, I fear, lead to friction much greater than any that need be apprehended under the scheme outlined by me. At present there is no friction, the system by which Captain Smyth increases his usefulness at the expense or the Consulate-General is only possible as a temporary measure. In this connection I agree with what Colonel Minchin has written on this subject, and would refer to his full and lucid explanations. 7. I also agree as to the Secret Service budgets being separated, with the reser vation that one budget be allowed to aid the other, if in a position to do so. Of course if my views be accepted the cost would be greater than at present, but, in my opimon no money could be better spent. The lessons of the recent war constitute an indisputable proof of the above. m , ?* I 1 iia ^ e “? t allu(led to the possibility of the establishment of a Consulate at betorM wfit-lT P ° Sltl( ? n f Meshed - « founded no intelligence system could be worked from it at any rate for some years—as the Consulate would be full of informers and watched by the secret police. Moreover, men working from a pilgrim wcentre like Meshed would be infinitely less liable to be detected, and complaints effect^ &amp; Consul ' General accredlte d to a neighbouring country would not bave^nuch 1 am aware that almost everything would depend on the “ give and take” of ^the Consul-General and the Military Attach^ in which connection I would venture to kpomt out that I have been connected with the Intelligence Department at home, in India and m South Africa.

In these circumstances I sanction the continuance of the appoint ment for two years from 1st April next, on the understanding that such savings are effected on the estimate enclosed in your Army Department Letter, No. 42, of 12th May last, as will keep the total expenditure within Rs. 30,000 a year. 3.

In view of the decision of the Treasury it would be useless to press a claim for any portion of the contingent expenditure. 5.

Certain vouchers of expenditure on this appointment, which have been received in this Office in connection with the Account Current, are returned herewith, as they will not be required by the Foreign Office, all that is needed being a statement by your Government of the amount expended, with any explanation of the figures that may be desirable. The amounts entered in the Account Current should be written back in a future Account. 1 1 have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.j ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Si r &gt; 2nd September 1910. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to address you, with reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 34,836 of 30th September 1909, on the subject of the permanent appointment of an intelligence officer at Meshed. The proposal was fully discussed in Sir A. Godley’s letter of 8th July 1908, and in Sir F. A. Campbell’s letter of 21st September 1908, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury were informed that “ Sir E. “ Grey considers that there can be no question of objecting to the charge “ on Imperial funds of one-half of the expense involved.” After some further correspondence their Lordships agreed to the appointment “ for “ a period of two years on the understanding that the question of its “ continuance will be considered at the end of that period.” (Sir G. Murray’s letter of 11th November 1908.) The period in question expires on 20th October next, and Viscount Morley trusts that Sir E. Grey will now be willing to press the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to agree to place the appointment upon a permanent footing. I am to enclose copy of a letter that has been received from the Government of India on the subject (Secret, No. 67 of 7th July 1910), and to say that His Lordship concurs in the views therein expressed. He is strongly of opinion that in the absence of any British Consular officer throughout the whole of Central Asia, it is impracticable, on Imperial no less than on Indian grounds, to dispense with the one trustworthy source of information as to what is taking place in a vast area which is, moreover, not open to the unrestricted movements of foreigners. Turning to the question of expenditure, I am to enclose copy of correspondence with the Government of India dealing with the points raised in your letter of 30th September 1909. Lord Morley agrees generally with the remarks of the Government of India as to the desig nation and duties of the intelligence officer at Meshed, who would, in his opinion, be better so described than by the somewhat misleading title of Military Attache. The question whether the expenditure is excessive should therefore, he thinks, be considered on its merits, without reference to that incurred on dissimilar appointments elsewhere. According to the information now furnished, the expenditure up to 21st October 1908 was as follows :— 1904- 05 - 1905- 06 1906- 07 1907- 08 1st April to 21st October 1908 Rs. £ 14,550 = 970 10,771 - 718 31,155 = 2,077 29,229 = 1,949 20,001 - 1,333 This expenditure has not, up to the present, been included in the annual statements of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia {vide Notes on Meshed in Enclosure 2 of the letter from this Office of 17th March 1909 and 19th March 1910); and, owing to a misapprehension, the Imperial Exchequer has been invited, and has undertaken, to share the pay only (varying from 574L 8s. to 927L 4s. per annum) of the officer holding the appointment. 10387. BV i As regards the future, it will he seen that the ordinary charges connected with the maintenance of the post are estimated by the Govern ment of India at Ks. 31,953 -= 2.130L, when the incumbent holds the rank of major. In your letter of 30th September 1909, Sir E. Grey expressed the opinion that the expenditure contemplated was neither in accordance with precedent nor with the requirements of the post of Military Attache, and that the proposal to charge one-half to the Imperial Exchequer was subject to grave and insuperable objection. Lord Morley ventures to hope that, on further consideration, Sir E. Grey will mitigate the severity of that judgment. The question of pre cedent has been dealt with by the Government of India. As regards the requirements of the post, it will be seen that the bulk of the expenditure is due not to the personal requirements of the officer, but to the nature of his duties. These duties involve the employment of an elaborate and necessarily somewhat expensive organisation, without which information can neither be obtained nor corroborated, and the Government of India are of opinion that any material reduction can only be effected at the expense of general efficiency. In this opinion Lord Morley concurs, with the exception that he thinks that the duties of the post could be adequately discharged by an officer with the rank of captain. By this reduction there would be a saving of about 190b per annum, and the maximum cost might be put roughly at 2,000b per annum. During the six years that have passed since the appointment was first proposed, the question of its maintenance has been examined from every point of view, with the result that the Army Council, the Govern ment of India, two Commanders-in-Chief in India, and three distinguished officials who have held the posts of Minister or Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, have been unanimous in recommending it—so long, at all events, as there are in Central Asia no British Consular officers from whom the same information might be obtained, though probably at greater expense. This recommendation was accepted in principle by Sir E. Grey in Foreign Office letter to the Treasury above quoted. Lord Morley fully shares Sir E. Grey’s desire for a substantial reduction in the cost of the Indian Consular establishments in Persia, and the question has for some time been under examination by the Government of India. His Lordship has reason to believe that their proposals will include a reduction of about Rs. 40,000 (2,666b) in the cost of the Meshed Consulate after providing for the Native Agent at Turbat-i-Haidari, where, as Sir E. Grey is aware, the Consulate has been abolished. In view of this important fact, and of the considerations urged above, Lord Morley earnestly trusts that Sir E. Grey will now move the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, to sanction, as a per manent measure, the payment of half the cost of the appointment of Military Attache, subject to a maximum of 2,000b per annum. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, Colin G. Campbell. Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, No. 32,081. Foreign Office, 12th October 1910. I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd ultimo on the subject of the Military Attache or Intelligence Officer at Meshed, suggesting that the post should now be made permanent and that the cost°of the officer’s salary and of the contingent expenses should be borne eouallv by the Indian and Imperial Exchequers. 1 7Go\eminent, viz., one half the pay of the officer, is a fair payment for the benefits received by them, and that if their contribution were to be extended to the contingent and other expenses, they would be paying more than they could legitimately be required to do. ’ * I am to request that you will submit these considerations to Viscount Morley, adding that Sir E.

As regards the incidence of cost, while recognising the force of the reference that Sir E. Grey makes to the opinion expressed by the Army Council in 1908, Viscount Morley desires to call especial attention to the statement made in paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s letter No. 67, of 7th July 1910 (which was one of the enclosures in Mr. Camp bell’s letter of 2nd September), that “ the Chief of the Imperial General “ Staff has recently addressed the Commander-in-Chief with a view to “ the General Staff in India assuming entire responsibility for intelli- “ gence work in Russian Turkestan, a proposition which His Excellency “ could only accept on the supposition that the services of a Military “ Attache at Meshed will be permanently retained.” In Lord Morley’s opinion this fact greatly strengthens the Indian claim that half the total expenditure on the appointment should be borne by Imperial funds, since a direct responsibility is now laid upon the Government of India, a responsibility, moreover, which even the permanent appointment of a Military Attache will not enable them to discharge unless the organi sation, without which the officer is useless, be sanctioned as well. I am to suggest that the views of the Army Council should be invited on this aspect of the question, and to express the hope that after consultation with them Sir Edward Grey will find himself able to accept the proposal made in Air. Campbell’s letter above quoted. As the period for which the appointment was tempoiaiily sanctioned expires on the 20th instant, I am to ask for the favour of an eaily The Under Secretary of State for India. 1 am, &amp;c., Louis AIallet.

I am directed by tbe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to refer to previous correspondence with your Department ending with your letter of 16th September 1908, on the subject of the post of Military Attache at Meshed. I am to transmit to you, for the infor mation of the Army Council, the enclosed copy of correspondence which ensued on that letter between this Department, the India Office, and the Treasury, from which it will be seen that the latter, in view of the Imperial interests involved, consented to the charge on the Imperial revenues of one half the expenditure involved, which at that period was given as amounting in all to five hundred and seventy- fourjpounds eight shillings (574L 8s.), seven hundred pounds (TOOL), or nine hundred and twenty-seven pounds four shillings (927Z. 4s.), according to the rank of the office] - employed. This sanction was in accordance with the usual procedure adopted for the adjustment of expenditure on His Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Establishments in Persia, whereby such expenditure is equally scared between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers, the latter’s share being debited to the Foreign Office Vote. In a subsequent letter of 10th September 1909 (copy also enclosed) the India Office brought to the notice of this Department further contingent expenses connected with the post, bringing the total expen diture for the year 1909-10 up to two thousand three hundred and seventy-two pounds (2,372L), and it was suggested that the sanction of the Treasury should be sought to charging a moiety of these contingent expenses, as well as of the pay of the Military Attache, against British revenues. To this step Sir E. Grey, for reasons set forth in the reply to the India Office fetter, felt himself unable to assent. In further correspondence, of which I am to transmit to you copies, the India Office have again reverted to this subject, and have adduced arguments in favour of reversing this decision. From a perusal of this correspondence the Army Council will see that, in the view of the Government of India, it is wrong to regard this post as coming under the arrangement mentioned above, by which a general sharing of expenditure in Persia is contemplated. The residence of the Militarylather than a correct appreciation of the nature of the post He has accepted the view put forward by the Army Council and other com petent authorities that the retention of the appointment is of value, at any late indirectly, to Imperial interests; but he has also felt convinced that the share hitherto borne by the Imperial Hxchequer has been fully commensui ate to the benefits received, and he has declined to approach the ^Iieasuiy with a view to increasing the sum at present contributed. The Despatches enclosed and the arguments adduced in the India Office letters of the 2nd September and 18th October emphasise the pin eh military character of the post; but so far from furnishing Sir E. Grey with any new reason why the share of the expense hitherto borne on the estimates of this department should be increased, they have rather led him to question whether the appointment in future should not rather be treated on the same footing as Military Attacheships in other parts of the world. In this view he is confirmed by the fact emphasised in the India Office letter of the 18th instant that the Imperial General Staff have addressed the Commander-in-Chief in India with a view to the General Staff in India assuming entire responsibility for intelligence work in Russian Turkestan. Sir E. Grey therefore 'feels that only the Army Council can fully estimate precisely to what extent the post of Intelligence Officer at Meshed is of value to Imperial interests, and that they are therefore alone able to recommend to the Treasury what share, if any. of the expenditure connected with the post should be borne by the Imperial Exchequer. I am therefore directed by Sir E. Grey to inquire what view the Army Council takes as to whether the post should be further temporarily retained or permanently established ; and I am to suggest that if they favour its retention they should enter into an arrangement with the India Office for an equitable sharing of the expenditure involved. I am to add that the period for which the retention of the post was sanctioned in 1908 expired on the 20th instant, but that the Lords Com missioners of the Treasury have sanctioned its continuance on the present footing till 31st December next pending a full discussion of the amount and incidence of the expenses attaching to the post.

The presence of a trained Intelligence Officer at Meshed constitutes the sole means of obtaining accurate information regarding events on the northern frontiers of Afghanistan and in Central Asia, and the Council are satisfied as to its necessity on military grounds. They are further of opinion that the Government of India should bear half the total cost (2,130Z. per annum), of the appointment. Such a division of cost follows the precedent of the Robat detachment (Treasury letter No. 6061, dated 2nd May 1907), and is in general accord with the principles recommended by Lord Welby’s Commission in 1900, as to the partition of charges between the Indian and the Imperial Exchequers in cases of expenditure in connection with that part of Central Asia which is adjacent to the borders of India or Afghanistan. (Paragraph 307 of Report). As regards the division of the Imperial share of the cost between the Foieign Office and this Department, it appears to the Council that, as a source oi reliable information not otherwise available to the Foreign*7?

I am to add that if any Imperial contribution is made in excess of half the officer’s pay, my Lords are disposed to think that, considering the nature of the expenditure and the absence of any control over it here, it should be subject to a maximum limit. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 10th instant, forwarding copy of a letter from the War Office relative to the permanent appointment of an intelligence officer at His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Meshed, and to state that Sir E. Grey is willing, if the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury so decide, that half the salary attached to this post should continue to be a charge on Foreign Office votes, though he considers that it would be preferable that the share of all expenses incurred under this head which is defrayed from Imperial sources should fall on the War Office alone. The view originally adopted by Sir E. Grey on this question was that the maintenance of the post was a matter in no sense of Imperial but purely of Indian interest, and though he was led partially to recede from this principle in deference to the representations made by the Secretary of State for India and to the opinion expressed by the Army Council that the continued existence of such an officer was of importance from an Imperial standpoint, he still considers that the Imperial interest served thereby is of a purely military as distinct from a diplomatic character.

On the whole the Council are of opinion that the interest of the War Department in the appointment would be adequately repre sented by a contribution of £500 a year, and that the balance of the Imperial share should fall on Foreign Office Votes. On this basis the Imperial 'diplomatic” value of the post would be assessed at about one fourth of the whole cost.

The resicence of the Military Attache, or as they would prefer to designate him, the Intelligence Officer, in Meshed is incidental, and due to the fact that neither he nor any British Consular Officer can resice in Hussion Turkestan.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to refer to your letter of the lltb November, 1908, intimating that the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury assented to the appointment of a military attache at Meshed for a period of t^o years on the understanding that the cost of his salary, varying according to his rank from 574L 8s. to 927Z. 4s., should be shared by the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. The period for which this sanction was given terminates on the 20th instant. I am to state that the question of continuing the appointment has been the subject of careful consideration, but that various questions have arisen between this department and the India Office both as to the amount and as to the incidence of the expenditure involved. There is a consensus of opinion that the maintenance of the post is necessary in the interests of both the Indian and the Imperial Governments, and I am to express Sir E. Grey’s hope that their Lordships will see fit to sanction a continuance of the expenditure involved under the now existing arrangement until the end of the_present, year, pending the full reference to you of the whole question at issue, which will shortly be made.

I am to state that in Sir E. Grey's opinion the post of Intelligence Officer at Meshed is maintained principally for Indian, and indirectly only for Imperial interests.

No. 42 of 1910. Army Department. To TEE EIGHT H0N0UEABLE VISCOUNT MOELEY OF BLAOKBUEN, O.M., His Majesty’s Secretary op State por India. Simla, the 12th May 1910, My Lord, We have duly received and considered Your Lordship’s (Secret) Despatch No. 29, dated 10th December 1909, with enclosures, in reply to our Military (Secret) Despatch No. 94, dated 12th August 1909, dealing with the expendi ture connected with the post of Military Attach^ at Meshed and the share to he borne by the Home and Indian Governments, respectively. 2. Your Lordship desires, in the first place, to he furnished with any obser vations we may wish to offer on Foreign Office letter No. 34836, dated 30th September 1909, addressed to the India Office. In this connection, we observe that Sir Edward Grey is apparently inclined to include this post of Military Attachd at Meshed in the general question of Indian Consular establishments in Persia. We are unable to endorse this view. Except for the fact that the Mili tary Attache resides at Meshed, as being in the circumstances the most convenient centre, the raison d’etre of the appointment is unconnected with Persia and is clearly shown in the original proposals for formed the subject of our Military (Secret) Persian affairs. That this is so, the creation of the post, which Despatch No. 170 of 1904. Further, we gather that Sir Edward Grey regards the appointment as being analogous with that of an ordinary Military Attacheship in Europe and elsewhere. We would submit, on the contrary, that a marked distinction is to he drawn between the two cases. Ordinarily, a Military Attache is accredited to and resides at the capital of the country concerned. He is a recognised official of the Embassy, or Legation, as the case may be, and thus acquires, and as a matter of courtesy is accorded, many facilities in the discharge of his duties. The Military Attache at Meshed, on the other hand, is very differently placed. He does not even reside in the country wherein are centred his respon sibilities. Although resident at Meshed, bis duties lie beyond the Persian border, in Russian Turkistan, and it is only by means of agencies located in Russian territory, that those duties can be adequately carried out. He is, in fact, an Intelligence Officer, forced by circumstances to reside outside the country on which he is expected to report. The pay of the agents employed forms an item of extraordinary expenditure which is obviously peculiar to the Meshed post. It will also readily be understood that the control of these agencies entails a more elaborate, and consequently a more costly, clerical establishment.■ We are, therefore, strongly of opinion that this appointment is to be regard ed as being of a very special nature, and distinct from British^ representation in Persia and Military Attaches in general. Were this appointment abolished we should be practically without any means of keeping ourselves informed con- cerning Russian military movements in Central Asia and on the Afghan border land. 3. We now proceed to give the information Your lordship desires on certain points :— (1) A statement showing the sums expended °n the appointment during the years 1904-05, 1905-06, 1906-07,1907-08, and from 1st April to 21st October 1908, is. attached. (Enclosure No. 1.) (2) The expenditure has not been included in the annual statements of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia, all charges having been passed direct to debit of the military estimates. (8) The Military Attache occupies a portion of the buildings of the Consulate-General, and any sums recovered on account of rent, debitable to the military estimates, willjbe taken in reduction of the general expenses of the Consulate. The Military Attache’s clerk lives outside the Consulate, and the payment of rent is a matter of private arrangement. (4) The “ contingent ” expenditure includes charges for telegrams, postage, printing and stationery, livery for chuprasi, firewood allowance, and miscellaneous office expenses. -f ur ^ n S the expenditure on telegrams alone amounted to Ks. J,8dU-y-b. It is very desirable, moreover, that the Military Attache should always have some money in hand for making small pecuniary rewards m special cases. Also, that following the invariable custom of the country, the entertaining o persons with whom the Military Attache, and more especially his clerk, ave dealings, should he provided for on a small scale. 4. As requested in paragraph 3 of Your Lordship’s Despatch under reply (a) A statement, showing the estimated ordinary charges connected with the maintenance of the post, is attached. (Enclosure No. 2.) (b) As regards the exceptional and occasional charges, Your Lordship will observe from the attached statement (Enclosure No. 1) that during the period covered, no such expenditure was incurred. We do not anticipate that any exceptional charges, other than those connected with the relief of the Military Attache or his clerk, will have to be met, and these should not recur, in ordinary cir cumstances, more frequently than every three to four years. 5. We have now replied in full to Your Lordship’s queries. We would add that having again scrutinised the total expenditure in volved in the proper maintenance of this appointment, any material reduction could, in our opinion, only be effected at the expense of its general efficiency. We trust that the views we have ventured to express will meet generally with Your Lordship’s concurrence, and that Your Lordship will see fit to approach the Foreign Office again on the subject of a full share of the total expenditure on this appointment being met by Imperial Funds. ilia6. We are addressing Your Lordship separately, again recommending that the appointment should now be placed on a permanent footing.

WS Your Lordship’s Foreign (Secret) telegram of the 2Sth November 1908 / t/o conveyed sanction to the appointment of a Military Attache at Meshed being continued for a period of two years with effect from 21st October 1908, subject to reconsideration on the expiry of that period. We now desire to ask Your Lordship for an early decision as to the maintenance of the appointment beyo nd that date. 2. The importance attached 'to this post and the reasons leading to its creation have been fully stated in the previous correspondence on the / subject, commencing with our military despatch No. 170 (Secret) of 1901. &gt;XX'x^Ai.y, J There is, in consequence, little that can be added to the forcible arguments which from time to time have been adduced in favour of this appointment being placed on a permanent footing. In this connection, we would desire to invite . \Your Lordship’s special attention to our military despatch No. 115 (Secret), / b ’dated 7th November 1907, and also to the correspondence between the India and Foreign Offices, copy of which reached us under cover of Your Lordship’s despatch No. 22 (Secret) of 18th December 1908, We desire to reiterate and endorse the arguments and opinions contained in these papers. 3. We may further bring to Your Lordship’s notice that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff has recently addressed the Commander-in-Chief w ith a view to the General Staff in India assuming entire responsibility for Intelligence work in Hussian Turkistan, a proposition which His Excellency could only accept on the supposition that the services of a Military Attache at Meshed will be permanently retained. We fully realise that the abolition of the appoint ment would place us at a serious disadvantage in the matter of maintaining anefficient Intelligence service. In support of this opinion we would invite Your Lordship’s attention to the letter of the 16th September 1908, from the War Office to the Foreign Office in which the Army Council urge that &lt;e interruption in the system of obtaining intelligence, which has been so successfully inaugu rated by the Military Attache at Meshed, would be disadvantageous to the Imperial as well as to the Indian Army/’ 4. A further careful consideration of this question in all its hearings has only deepened our conviction that this appointment is a necessary one, and we therefore feel no hesitation, both in Imperial and Indian interests, in strongly recommending its permanent continuance for Your Lordship’s favourable con sideration. 5. We have addressed Your Lordship separately regarding the cost of the appointment in our Despatch No. 42, dated the 12th May 1910. We have the honour to he.

Before replying to the Foreign Office, I shall be glad to be fur nished, at a very early date, with any observations on their letter which Your Excellency may wish to offer, and also with information on the following points : — (1.) What sums were expended on the appointment during the years 1904-05, 1905-06, 1906-07, 1907-08, and from 1st April to 21st October 1908, details of the expenditure being given, as far as possible, under the heads shown in the statement accompanying your letter of the 12th August 1909 ? (2.) Has this expenditure been included in the annual statements of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia (vide Memo- morandum accompanying Political Despatch of 30th July 1909, No. 73) ? (3.) Is there any additional outlay for quarters owing to the presence of the Military Attache and his clerk? If they occupy a portion of the buildings of the Consulate-General, I presume that the rent paid is taken in reduction of the general expenses of the Consulate. (4.) What is the “contingent” expenditure for which an annual charge of Rs. 4,356 (29U.) is estimated. I if3. Finally, I request that I may be furnished with a careful estimate of— (a) The ordinary charges connected with the maintenance of the post; and (b) The exceptional and occasional charges, information being given as to the intervals at which these may be expected to occur. I observe, for instance, that the expenditure on travelling in 1909-10 is high in consequence of the officer being relieved, and that there is also additional expenditure for an officiating clerk. 1 have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn. fENCLOSURES.

With reference to previous correspondence, ending with the letter' :i: ' of this Office dated the 21st December last, as to the appoint ment of Military Attache at Meshed, I am directed to enclose copy of a letter! from the Government of India, pointing out that, in addition to •f t ++ a ta PW of the Military Attache, T feecret Letter, Army Department, • r ^ n at o 1 a No. 94, of the 12th August 1909. varying fiom oi4L 8s. to 927L 45. a year according to rank, there are certain miscellaneous expenses connected with the appointment which should he shared, as in other analogous cases, equally between the British and Indian Governments. Viscount Morley regrets that this aspect of the matter has not previously been brought to notice in the correspondence, but he trusts that Secretary Sir E. Grey will see lit to represent it to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, and move them to accept as a charge against British revenues a moiety of the total expenditure involved in the appointment. That expenditure will have approximately amounted to 863Z. for the period 21st October 1908 to 31st March 1909, and is likely to amount to 2,3121. during the current financial year.

I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, in which you forward a copy of a letter from the Government of India, pointing out that, in addition to the pay of the Military Attache at Meshed, there are certain miscellaneous expenses connected with the appointment which, in their opinion, should be shared equally between the British and Indian Governments. Sir E. Grey observes that the total expenditure during the current financial year is thus likely to amount to 2,372k, or 1,445L more than the maximum amount of pay which the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury have agreed to share with the Indian Exchequer. He has examined the items of this supplementary expenditure, and, after careful consideration, he has arrived at the conclusion that it is not such as he could properly recommend their Lordships to sanction. Apart from the general considerations relating to the necessity for a substantial reduction in the cost of the Indian Consular establishments in Persia, to A 2 S. 26.which, as you are aware, Sir E. Grey attaches great importance, he is of opinion that the special expenditure now contemplated would neither be in accordanee with precedent nor with the requirements of the post of Military Attache. There are, as the Secretary of State is no doubt aware, 12 British Military Attaches in various parts of the world, and their sole cost to His Majesty’s Government consists in their pay and in travelling allowances when sent on a journey. This is likewise the case with the Military Attache at Tehran, who receives a travelling allowance limited to a specific sum according to the duration of his^ journeys. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey is unable to endorse the view r of the Government of India that the post at Meshed should constitute a solitary and costly exception, and he considers that the division of the expendi ture involved with the Imperial Exchequer is subject to grave and insuperable objection.

J. 1525In the correspondence during the past 3 years as to the desirability of maintaining the appointment of Military Attache at Meshed, no reference has been made to the fact that in January 1907 the Treasury included this appointment in a list of proposals for new expenditure in Persia to which they had up till then withheld their assent, but in respect of which they declared themselves to be on further consideration prepared to share the cost of such of the proposals as had already been carried into effect (Letter from Treasury to Foreign Office dated 25th January 1907 - Annex. 1 to inclosure 2 in Political Despatch to India No.34, 29th March 1907). The Foreign Office were aware as far bach as 1905 that a Military Attache had actually been provisionally sent to Meshed^and on receipt of the Treasury letter of January 1907 the question of his permanent retention might perhaps have been regarded as settled. This letter was apparently overlooked, however, and the correspondence has ended in the Treasury agreeing instead to the provisional appointmentI. 0 . appointment of a military attach^ for two years with effect from 21st October 1908. There are two financial questions now to he settled, the first being the incidence of the cost of the temporary appointment from February 1905, when it was first proposed by this Off l c e &gt; October 1908, and secondly the settlement of the questions as to the expenditure since the latter date which are dealt with in the present letter from the Foreign Office* As regards the first, the following note was appended by this Department to the annual claim on account of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia which was sent to the Foreign Office in March last* x 'It is not clear whether these figures include x __ Cof *pay and all'owanees ,r ) 'the cost of the Military Attache, whose it Meshed in 1905-6 and ) 190 6-7). _ ) w temp or ary appointment was covered by 'the terms of the Treasury letter to the Foreign ^Office of 25th January 1907, No*1447 The 'Government of India will be asked for information on 'this point'; and in the memorandum sent to the Government of India with Political Despatch 72 of 20th July 1909 the questionquestion was also put whether the expenditure on the Military Attache prior to 1906-7 had been included in the previous annual statements of diplomatic and consular expenditure m Persia* Before replyinq to the present letter from the Foreign Office it would be of considerable advantage to us to have this information from the Government of India and I would suggest that they be asked to expedite it. I am inclined to think that the Treasury are pledged under the terms of their letter of January 1907 to hear half the cost of the temporary appointment from say April 1905 to October 1908 provided that outlay did not exceed the amount stated in the India Office letter of 1st February 1905, viz. &lt;£574-8 for a Lieutenant £700 for a Captain. £927-4 for a Major. plus a travelling allowance on the scale allowed to political officers stationed in Persia. It appears from the Government of India's Political Letter of 26th March 1908, No.67, however,' that the expenditure on the Military1 s Military Attache in 1905-6 and the two following years was 1905- 6 Rs.22.824 1906- 7 Rs.26,050 1907- 8 Rs.23,260 &lt;£1522. £1737. £1551. which, seems to show that there has all along been outlay in connection with the appointment over and above the officer's pay and travelling allowances. I would venture to suggest a draft Despatch to India worded somewhat as follows. The draft embraces some of the questions brought to notice by Sir Beauchamp Duff:J !Un v~ -k In any further communica tion pn this subject, please quote No. 34636/09. and address — The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office Foreign Office, London.

Sir E. Grey observes that the total expenditure during the current financial year is thus likely to amount to Two thousand three hundred and seventy-two pounds, or One thousand four hundred and forty-five pounds more than the maximum amount of pay which the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury have agreed to share with the Indian Exchequer., j He has examined the items of this supplementary expenditure' and The Under Secretary of State India Office.(34836-/09) and, after careful consideration, he has arrived at the con elusion that it is not such as he could properly recommend Their Lordships to sanction. Apart from the general consid erations relating to the necessity for a substantial reduc tion in ohe cost of the Indian Consular establishments in Persia, to which, as you are aware, Sir E. Grey attaches great importance, he is of opinion that the special expend iture now contemplated would neither be in accordance with precedent nor with the requirements of the post of Military Attache. There are, as the Secretary of State is no doubt aware, twelve British Military Attaches in various parts of the world; and their sole cost to His Majesty’s Govern ment consists in their pay and in travelling allowances when sent on a journey: this is likewise tdie case with the Military Attache at Tehran, who receives a iravelling al lowance limited to a specific sum according to the duration of his journeys. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey is unable to endorse the view of the Government of India that the post at Meshed should constitute a solitary and costly exception, and he considers that the division of the ex penditure(34636/09) expenditure involved with the Imperial Lxchequer is subject to grave and insuperable objection. 1 am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,Q i V ^ \ \ ll5B&gt; 5909.

Qf^ ce w hich COUVCyed authority for the charge to Imperial funds of one half of the cost involved, the amount in question is stated as “ varying according to the rank of the officer employed, from ^574-8 to ^927-4 per annum.” We would point out that, in addition to the actual pay of the incumbent, there are certain miscellaneous expenses connected with the appointment, which should be shared equally by the Imperial and Indian Governments as in other similar cases-such as our Consular establishments in Persia-where arrangements exist in the interests jointly of the Home and Indian Governments. a.

War Office to Foreign Office. War Office, Sir, 16th September 1908. 1 am commanded by the Army Council to acknowledge the receipt of 3 r our letter dated the 7th instant, requesting that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may be informed of the grounds upon which the Army Council base their opinion that, from the point of view of Imperial military interests, the post of Military Attache to His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Meshed should be maintained. 2. In reply, I am to say that the Army Council endorse the views expressed by the Government of India in their Despatch of the 7th November 1907, and are of opinion that the interruption of the system of obtaining intelligence, which has been so successfully inaugurated by the Military Attache at Meshed, would be disadvantageous to the Imperial as well as to the Indian Army. 3. Although the conclusion of the recent Convention has, no doubt, improved our relations with Russia and removed much cause for anxiety, the Army Council consider that it would be imprudent, by withdrawing our Attache from Meshed, to deprive India, and, indirectly, the General Staff, of a source of accurate information regarding events on the northern frontier of Afghanistan and in Central Asia. 4. It further seems desirable that the working of the new arrange ments under which local disputes between Russian and Afghan frontier officials are to be settled should be carefully watched, the more so as, judging from past experience, the reports of such local disputes are liable to produce a feeling of unrest and anxiety, due to distortion and exaggeration, unless they pass through the censorship of a trained and competent military intelligence officer. 5. The sphere of activity which Seistan offers to the Russian officer who has been appointed Military Attache in that region is a limited one, the information which he may be able to acquire can be little more than is already at the disposal of the Russian military authorities, and the loss entailed by the withdrawal of our Attache from Meshed would not, from a military point of view, be counterbalanced by the removal of the Russian officer from Seistan. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, R- Brade. Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to Treasury. Foreign Office, g- r 21st September 1908. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to refer you to the letter from this Office of the 6 th March 1905, forwarding copies of correspondence relative to the appointment of a Military Attache to His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Meshed, and to that of the 18th Decembei of the same year.The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury are already aware that this post was created as a temporary measure on the suggestion of the Government of India. The creation of the post as a temporary one was advocated by Sir A. Hardinge, at that time His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, who subsequently expressed the opinion that it should be permanently maintained. . a- n a • Sir A. Hardinge’s view was shared by his successor, Sir G. bprmg- Rice, and is also held by His Majesty s Charge d Affaires at d ehran and Consul-General at Meshed. -i a- On the 21st January last Mr. Marling addressed a Despatch to Sir E. Grey, inquiring wdiether any decision had been reached as to the advisability of making the appointment permanent, and Sir E. Grey accordingly caused a letter to be addressed to the India Office indoising Mr. Marling’s opinion that the post should be maintained, and requesting information as to the conclusion which might be arrived at on the sinloj ect The India Office, in reply, forwarded a copy of a despatch from the Government of India strongly recommending the maintenance of the post, and stated that Viscount Morley was disposed to acquiesce in its, continuance fora further fixed period, subject to eventual reconsideration and to the condition that the cost involved should be equally divided between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. Having regard, on the one hand, to the strong opinion expressed by the Government of India that the post should be maintained, and, on the other, to the expense wffiich would be incurred by the Imperial Exchequer in consequence of the permanent existence of two British Military Attaches in Persia on the proposed terms, Sir E. Grey addressed to Mr. Marling a telegram inquiring his view as to the advisability of abolishing the post of Military Attache to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran. Mr. Marling replied by telegraph strongly deprecating this step. Sir E. Grey still felt unable to recommend the Lords Commissioners to sanction the charge to British funds of half the expense involved by the maintenance of a Military Attache at His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Meshed, but the Secretary of State for India adduced further and cogent arguments in favour of the arrangement proposed, and suggested that the question whether the appointment could or could not be regarded as of importance to Imperial interests from the military point of view should be referred to the consideration of the Army Council. The Army Council was therefore consulted, and gave an opinion strongly favourable to the permanent maintenance of the post at Meshed. They indorsed the views expressed by the Government of India, and expressed the opinion that the interruption of the system of obtaining intelligence which had been so successfully inaugurated by the Military Attache at Meshed would be disadvantageous to the Imperial as well as to the Indian Army. They stated that, although the conclusion of the recent Convention had no doubt improved our relations with Russia aud removed much cause for anxiety, they considered that it w r ould be imprudent, by with drawing our Attache from Meshed, to deprive India, and indirectly the General Staff, of a source of accurate information regarding events on the northern frontier of Afghanistan and in Central Asia. It seemed, further, desirable that the working of the new arrange ments under which local disputes between Russian and Afghan frontier officials were to be settled should be carefully watched, the more so as, judging from past experience, the reports of such local disputes were liable to produce a feeling of unrest and anxiety, due to distortion and exaggeration, unless they passed through the censorship of a trained and competent military intelligence officer. In view of this opinion and of the earnest recommendation of the India Office, the Government of India, and all His Majesty’s Diplomaticand Consular officers on the spot, Sir E. Grey considers that there can he no question of objecting to the charge on Imperial funds of one-half of the expense involved, which amounts, in all, to 574 L 8 , 9 ., 700Z., or 9271. 4s. a year, according to the rank of the officer employed. I am accordingly to request that this proposal may be submitted to the early and favourable consideration of the Lords Commissioners. I am, &amp;c., The Secretary to the Treasury. F. A. Campbell.

In reply, I am to request you to inform Secretary Sir E. Grey that, while my Lords can only accept the view of the Army Council that the special intelligence obtained by this Attache under the temporary arrangement now in force is of value for Imperial purposes, they are^ not satisfied, on present information, that the intelligence cannot be obtained without the proposed large increase in the expenditure at Meshed. It appears that there are already two Indian officers at Meshed, as Consul- General and Vice-Consul respectively, and their Lordships have no information before them to show whether, if one of these officers could not obtain the necessary intelligence, the post of Vice-Consul could not be abolished on the appointment of a Military Attache. I am to take the opportunity of referring to the question (on which my Lords have not as yet received any full expression of the views of the Secretary of State) raised in the last paragraph of Treasury letter of the 25th January 1907 (No. 1447/07), as regards expenditure in Persia generally, and I am to say that their Lordships _ feel strongly, especially in view of the agreement recently concluded with Russia, that an effort should be made to avoid any increase in the establishment at Meshed.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 34,465, dated the 14th instant, enclosing copy of a letter from the Treasury as to the proposed permanent appointment of a Military Attache at Meshed. The Lords Commissioners enquire, with reference to the present position of the general question of the scale of expenditure in Persia, as to wdiich they have not yet received a full expression of the views of the Secretary of State, whether the post of Vice-Consul at Meshed could not be abolished on the appointment of a Military Attache. The position of the Consul-General and Vice-Consul at Meshed is stated in paragraph 5 of my letter of the 8 th July last. As regards the general question of the scale of expenditure, 1 am to refer to the telegram from the Viceroy of the 9th instant, stating that the Government of India are sending a despatch on the subject of the Consular Establishments maintained by them, but that they do not see their way to suggest a reduction. Lord Morley concurs entirely with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury as to the importance of restricting the expenditure on these establishments, and will give the subject his fullest consideration, in consultation with Sir E. Grey, on the receipt of the despatch promised by the Government of India. In the meantime, as inconvenience is caused by the strictly temporary footing on which the appointment is at present being continued, Lord Morley trusts that Sir E. Grey will obtain the consent of the Lords Commissioners to the proposal made in my letter of the 17th March last, and that the appointment of Military Attache at Meshed should be sanctioned, at the joint charge of the Indian and British Exchequers, for a period of, say, two years, the question of continuing the appointment being considered at the end of that period.

Od.) to nine hundred and twenty-seven pounds four shillings (927k 4s. Od.) a year, to be borne equally between the Indian and Imperial Governments. With regard to the second paragraph of your letter, I am to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, that the point to which you refer had already engaged the attention of the Secretary of State, and formed the subject of an enquiry addressed to the India Office in a letter dated 14th May. That Department replied, however, in the following terms :— “ The suggestion in your letter that the duties at present performed by Captain Smyth should be discharged in future either by the Consul-General or the Vice-Consul at Meshed does not seem practicable. The latter officer is usually a member of the Indian Medical Service, and does not possess the necessary technical qualifications. The Consul-General’s duties do not afford him sufficient leisure to undertake the work. It was the insufficiency of the news supplied by the staff of the Consulate- General without the assistance of a special officer that led to the appointment of Captain Smyth.” In reply to the final paragraph of your letter I am to inform you that the question to which you allude has not been lost sight of, though any reduction in the existing establishments in Persia would have to be effected gradually, and if possible in pursuance of an understanding with the Russian Government. Sir E. Grey trusts, however, that the appointment of a Military Attache at Meshed may be considered on its merits, apart from the larger question; and, as inconvenience is caused by the strictly temporary footing on which the appointment is at present being continued, Sir E. Grey earnestly trusts that the appointment may be sanctioned, at the joint charge of the Indian and British Exchequers, for a period of, say, two years, the question of its continuance to be considered at the end of that period.

Foreign Secret. Your telegram of the 9th September on Cox’s letter of the 6 th June about situation in the Persian Gulf. We agree with Marlino- (vide his letter No. 167, dated 14th July) that Cox might advantageously visit Teheran. &amp; j As regai ds Russian Consular representatives, we are sending a Despatch on our own consular establishments in Persia, in which we do not see our | way to suggest reduction. We do not, therefore, recommend suggestion of i relinquishment by Russia of Bunder Abbas consulate. Ovseenko’s transfer would no doubt be desirable, but, in view of Marling’s statement that de Hart wig has high opinion of Ovseenko, it would perhaps not be wise to press it just now. In view of efforts of Germany, we support Marling’s and Cox’s proposal for ice-Consulate, Lmgah, Indian revenues to bear half cost. The appointment might, in the first instance, be for three years only. re g ar( I s policing of trade routes, we made proposal in our Despatch No. 33, 15th March 1906, for utilising sowars. We have not yet received views of His Majesty s Government on this proposal. In changed conditions, we doubt practicability of taking action without interfering with integrity and independence of Persia. His Majesty’s Government are in a better position than we to judge of attitude of European powers to a radical change in the Customs. If the raising of this question would give Germany an opening for interference and suggestion of international control, it would probably be better to leave things alone until the whole financial position in Persia comes under treatment in connection with a loan or bankruptcy. We agree with Cox that if present conditions continue, three subsidised ships will not suffice for the Gulf. But this question might lie over until the results of the Arms Conference are known. As regards extension of cable communication, please see our telegram of the 21 st ultimo. As regards trucial coast, we still await Cox’s further representation. In recording our opinions, we wish to make it clear that they are made with reference to present condition of Persian politics and finances, and apparent hopelessness of securing substantial reforms. It is also important, as the Afghans are watching developments in Persia closely, that no action should be taken at present which would materially alter status quo in Persia. k N. n (ytjr cr£ _' / j Foreign Office October \\i 1908. 7 V * With reference to India Office letter of August 11th, 1908, I am directed hy Secretary Sir E.

I AM anectecl by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to refer you to the letter from this Office of the 6 th March, 1905, forwarding copies of correspondence relative to the appointment of a AEilitaiy Attache to His Majesty s Consul ate-General at Meshed and to that of the 18th December of the same year. dhe Loids Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury are already aware that this post v as created as a temporary measure on the suggestion of the Government of India. The creation of the post as a temporary one was advocated by Sir A. Hardino-e, at that time His Majesty s Minister at -Tehran, who subsequentlv expressed the opinion that it should be permanently maintained. ' 1 Sir A. Hardinee’s view was shared by his successor, Sir C. Spring-Mice, and is Hardinge’s view by His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires at Tehran and Consul-General at &lt;y 0 also held Meshed. On the 21st January last Air. Marling addressed a despatch to Sir E. Grey inquiring whether any decision had been reached as to the advisability of m akin a- the appointment permanent, and Sir E. Grey accordingly caused a letter to be addressed to the India Office indorsing Mr. Marling s ojnnion that the post should be maintained, and requesting information as to the conclusion which might be arrived at on the subject. — — —' The India Office, in reply, forwarded a copy of a despatch from the Government of India strongly recommending the maintenance of the post, and stated that A iscount Morley was disposed to acquiesce in its continuance for a further fixed period subject to eventual reconsideration and to the condition that the cost involved should be equally divided between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. Having regard, on the one hand, to the strong opinion expressed by the Govern ment of India that the post should be maintained, and, on the other, to the expense which would be incurred by the Imperial Exchequer in consequence of the permanent existence of two British Military Attaches in Persia on the proposed terms, Sir E. Grev addressed to Air. Marling a telegram inquiring his view as to the advisability of abolishing the post of Military Attache to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran. Air. Marling replied by telegraph strongly deprecating this step. Sir E. Grey still felt unable to recommend the Lords'Commissioners to sanction the .charge to Biitish funds of half the exjiense involved by the maintenance of a Military Attache at His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Meshed, but the Secretary of btate for India adduced further and cogent arguments in favour of the arran° &gt; enient proposed, and suggested that the question whether the appointment could or could not be regarded as of importance to Imperial interests from the military point of view should be referred to the consideratio n of the Army Council. The Army Council was therefore consultedTand gave an opinion strongly favourable to the permanent maintenance of the post at Meshed. Ihey indoised the views expressed by the Government of India, and expressed the opinion that the interruption of the system of obtaining intelligence which had been so successfully inaugurated by the Military Attache at Meshed would be disadvantageous to the Imperial as well as to the Indian army. They stated that, although the conclusion of the recent Convention had no doubt improved our relations with Russia and removed much cause for anxiety, they considered that it would be imprudent, by withdrawing our Attache from Meshed, to deprive India, and indirectly the General Staff, of a source of accurate information regarding events on the northern frontier of Afghanistan and in Central Asia. It seemed, further, desirable that the working of the new arrangements under which local disputes between Russian and Afghan frontier officials were to be settled should be carefully watched, the more so as, judging from past experience, the reports of such local disputes were liable to produce a feeling of unrest and anxiety, 2 a.

The total expenditure for the past financial year has not yet been compiled, but, as will be seen from paragraph 2 of the annexure, it is estimated at Rs. 20,000/-. 3. From the remarks in the statement attached to the Controller of Military Accounts’s letter, it appears that the charge of Rs. 8696/2/8 on account of Ordnance Stores does not form part of the cost of the appointment of the Military Attache, but has been incurred for the general requirements of the Consulate Sxnsxt and Consular Escort.

It is stated in this letter that Mr. Secretary Morlay understands that Sir E. Grey is not disposed to adhere to the view previously expressed by him that the appointment is one of purely Indian interest and that Mr. Morley is prepared, if Sir E.Grey will accept the principle of an equal division of cost between the British and Indian exchequers, to approve the retention of Captain Smyth in the post till Oc- , ■ ''V tober 20th next^and the continuance of the appointment there for a period of three years, the Question of maintaining the post being reconsidered at the end of that time. The Under Secretary of State, India Office. I IX '.--I am to state in reply that a misapprehension appears to exist as to Sir E.Grey's views on this subject. In his opinion, the description given of this appointment in Sir E.Gorst's letter of February 11th, 1905 as 'one of purely Indian interest' is even more applicable to it at this moment than it was at the time when those words were written. The conclusion of the recently signed Anglo-Fus- sian Convention has modified the situation m Central Asia from the point of view of Imperial interests by removing, in a great measure, the urgent need for the collection of information as to the movements of Rus sian troops in that region. Sir E.Grey considers that His Majesty's Consul General and Vice-Consul at Meshed, both of whom are officers of His Majesty's Indian Army, should be able to collect without difficulty such information of this nature as is still necessary more especially in view of the fact that they will, presumably, still remain in possession of those means of obtaining it which havehave been devised and are now controlled hy the Mili tary Attach^.

I am to request you to draw the attention of Mr. Secretary Morley to the opinion expressed by Sir Cecil Spring-Rice in his despatch No.168 of July 24th, 1907, copy of which was enclosed in the letter under refer ence and endorsed by Mr. Marling in his despatch No.223 of October 9th of the same year (see Persia, Confiden tial Print, October 28th, Section 15). I am to add that Sir E.

I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,Reference Paper Letter No. 3 Q tec- / — TL^v. iskT?. - Referred to ^ ■' *' day of v ’'Set*. 190 ' . The appointment, the establishment of which on a permanent oasis is now under consideration, has during the three years of its unoffic ial existence earned unanimous approve al . Both the Foreign Office representatives in Persia, who have watched over and benefit ted by its operations, as well as the Govt of India, who originated it, are satis fied that the hax results obtained in the trial justify its creation ♦ Prom a purely military point of view no doubt as to its importance can be admitted but it is in the negative sense that i$rs work is perhaps of the greatest value, providing as it does the ; necessary machinery for sifting and disproving on the spot those bazaar rumours which in the East are of frequent occurrence and which must otherwise reach the Govt of India in a greatly exaggerated form . Absence of reliable information is is the father of scares which in their i ■ inevitably ^ | turn]beget military expenditure • Without such machinery it is exceeding l ly difficult for the authorities in India to judge of the extent to which 17908. 1. 1680. 1000.—9/1906.f reports from native sources (the only sources), unsifted by a knowledgeable man \ in touch with the idiosyncracies of the bearers or senders , can be trusted . And it would be impossible under such circumstances to hold India responsible for messages of an alarmist nature cabled home . Owing to our having no recognised agents in Russian Central Asia, East of the Caspian, the Imperial Military authorities are entirely dependent on India for information as to Russian doings in those regions and the state of the country generally - a fact which throws on the Indian Government no light responsibility . There is a Ra-eedrafi consul at Baku but as he is in trade and receives only a small remuneration for supplying military information he cannot be expected to endanger his businedd prospects by arousing the suspicion of the local autnorities . Captain Smyth has taken considerable time to find and get in touch with the various native orgaju he is successfully working ; if the appointment be dis continued any new man sent in time of emergency to Meshed will have to commence again at the beginning . - ^ 8X11 strongly in favour of the appointment being created . 11 If it is decided td create it the question of who is to pay will arise and in this matter I do not ail-together agree with the opinion expressed in previous papers on this file . in originally recommending the creation of the appointment the Govt of India in their Despatch 170 of 1st Bee 04, asked that H.M* s Govt should hear half the cost , basing their request on the principl® of the division of charges for appointments in Persia, a principle laid down by the Royal Commission on Expenditure in India . When the matter was referred, however,to the Foreign Office Lord Lansdowne declined to observe the principle in this particular instance on the grounds / that there is already a Military Attache at Tehran and that the question of appointing an additional Officer to Meshed appeared to be one of purely Indian interest (F.O letter 2626, dated 11-2-05) . In my opinion the Oovt of India appear to have been in the wrong in basing their request on the above quoted principle which referred undoubtedly to charges connected with appointments in Persia created with regard to that country alone . The duties of the Military / Attache at the capital, for instance, are connected only with the military forces and strategical developments within that Empire . The appointment under consideration^ though on Persian soil , has nothing to do with that country and on these grounds it would seem that the F.O were correct in refusing a request based on the principle observed with regard to Persian appointments . The whole raison-d 1 etre of this appointment is to obtain information of Russian doings in Russian Central Asia . Properly speaking this should be done by our Military attache at Petersburg but for numerous reasons this is impossible . Meshed was, therefore, selected as the most suitable base from which this second military attache' (for Russia) should work in the absence of agents in Central Asia . jSg jray jDp6tKboci T If the appointment iI would suggest that the; is decided onjfee F.O shewed be approached as to the desirability of appointing a second military attache^ to Russia for Russian Central Asia to reside at Meshed (residence at Tashkend might lead to request for a Russian Officer at Simla ) and India mighty to facilitate con currence^ offer. to pay half charges .

Army Department. To THE RIGHT HON’BLE JOHN MORLEY, O.M., HIS MAJESTY’S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. Simla, the ’/th November igoj* of tfhe 6th April last, we had the honour to address you by telegrani, No ; 2819-C., of the 2nd October in which we recommended the retention of the appointment of the Military Attache, Meshed, beyond the 20th October of this year. We have \ ^ since received your telegram of^th October and we note with satisfaction that you have been pleased to sanction Captain Smyth’s retention at Meshed for a further period of six months, dating from 20th instant, pending a decision on the whole question. In the present despatch we propose to lay before you in detail the reasons that have led us to make this recommendation, which embraces :— (&lt;7) the conversion of the temporary appointment into a permanent one ; (b) the retention of the present incumbent, Captain Smyth, The Cheshire Regiment, for a period of one year to the 20th October 1908. 2. We had hoped to address you at an earlier date on this subject, but, as it would necessarily be affected by the results of the recent negotiations with Russia, we considered it desirable to await the signature of the Conventions relating to Persia and Afghanistan when the situation, thereby created, would bo 3 . It will be seen from the enclosure to our Military despatch, No. 170 of the 1 st December 1904 , in which the creation of this appointment was suggested, that Lord Kitchener considered it a necessity in order that a sound system of intelli gence of events in Central Asia might be substituted for the conditions then obtaining under which we were dependent chiefly on unreliable and untrained native agents, who, in too many cases, merely transmitted to Meshed the unsitted gossip of the various Central Asian bazaars. 4 . The proposal was referred to His Majesty s Minister at Tehran, who &lt; /oO replied in his despatch, No. 113 of the 22 nd May 1905 , that the work of obtain ing full, reliable and early particulars of political events and military move ments in Central Asia and on the Afghan frontiers required the concen trated and undivided attention of one man and could not be combined with the daily multifarious duties of the Agent and Consul-General at Meshed, bir A. Hardinge, consequently, supported the proposal, but at first as a temporary measure until the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese war. In the meantime he proposed to visit Meshed, to make himself more fully acquainted with the nature of the work of the Military Attache, and to consider the question CrTthe' 4 pot. &lt;0 3 On the 9 th September 1905 , when the war had come to , 4 , close,, SirAi Hardinge, in his despatch No. 197 , reported that his visit to M|s^4ia and clearer.fj ■ rv y it a him that the work then devolving on Captain Smyth could not be properly per formed by the Consul-General or the Indian Political Attache. He therefore strongly recommended that the Military Attache should be retained at Meshed until we had not only obtained from the Russian Government the recognition of a British Consul at Tashkent or elsewhere in Central Asia, but had also tested by practical experience the possibilities of obtaining through him all the political and military intelligence we require. In support of his recommendation he pointed out that for information regarding military matters in Central Asia the Government of India and the Intelligence Department must largely depend on news supplied from Meshed—a remark that applies with equal force at the present time—and he expressed the hope that, if the successful system evolved by Captain Smyth were allowed to develop, before long we should be in pos session of early and ample information of every important event in Central Asia. Since the date of that letter two years have elapsed, and the result 5 attained in this interval have, in our opinion, justified Sir A. Hardinge’s expecta tions. 6. Sir A. Hardinge’s opinion of the importance of Meshed as a centre for the collection of military and political intelligence and of the consequent necessity for the retention there of the Military Attache is shared by Sir C. Spring-Rice, whose v concurrence was communicated to you in His Excellency the Viceroy’s telegram 1 of the 6th March last. In his despatch No. 122, dated the 12th June 1907, to the Right Hon’blethe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir C. Spring-Rice has again urged the great importance of Meshed as a centre for the acquisition of such intelligence, and, in his No.*i68 of the 24th of the following month, has renewed his recommendation that the Military Attache at Meshed should be retained. 7. We would also invite attention to the opinions expressed on this subject by the Consul-General, Meshed. t a ^ e ^ erj 8 ,_ C\ of the 31st May last, to the Government of India on the subject of the recent negotiations with Russia and their possible effects on the position of the Meshed Consulate-General, Major Sykes wrote. . under Captain Smyth an unique net-work of intelligence embracing Trans-Caspia and Turkistan, has been woven. Possibly, too, in the near future this net-work may cover the provinces to the east A third point is that the Consulate-General at Meshed watches Western Afghanistan and Herat. Consequently it would appear inadvisable, if only on this account, to weaken British prestige at the capital of Khorasan.” infhipn* ^ ^ t ^ US keseen that until last month the reasons which have influenced all concerned in urging that the military attacheship at Meshed should made a permanency have been almost entirely of a military character We alMn b Tn 7 v 'T 65 &gt; by ‘ h u e St T g COnSensus of °P inion emanating from concLfon of AT Tr W “ h authorit 7 this subject, but we think that the conclusion of the recent Convention with Russia must necessarily involve a reconsideration of the matter in the light of the altered conditions.

We ng from that the [volve a erto the ery real nt years tan and i India, almost earn the re may luenced at the ther to e which lasting ipardis* of what If we are to continue in the future to receive exaggerated bazaar rumours, or garbled Afghan versions, wholly unchecked by reports derived from trained and reliable agents, as to what is passing in Central Asia, it seems probable that the mutual suspicion and distrust which have unfortunately obtained in the past, and which it should now be our particular object to remove, may continue to exist. 1 he closer relations between Russia and Afghanistan which may now be ex pected, consequent on the discussion of non-political matters between the local officials of the two countries, will require very careful watching, and may even give rise to some friction. In view of the distorted accounts of such in cidents which we would be liable to receive from both parties, we consider that, from the point of view of making the recent Convention a success, it is most desirable that we should be in a position to receive direct and impartial informa tion as to what is really happening. As we are placed at present, without any con sular or other representative in the whole stretch of Russian territory from Baku to Kashgar, this can only be obtained by means of the agency established by Captain Smyth from Meshed as a centre. Moreover, we have yet to see how the Amir takes the Convention with Russia regarding Afghanistan. This aspect also will require careful watching. Even should his attitude prove studiously correct, his control over the northern provinces of his kingdom is not yet so complete and assured as to make it certain that his local officers, far removed from the supervision of the capital, wall carry out his instructions in the exact spirit in which they are given. The same holds true, to a certain extent, of the local Russian officials, if we are to judge from the examples of the past. In short, local incidents, liable to develop friction, are almost inevitable, and we regard it as essential that we should be placed in a position to know from other sources what the rights and wrongs of these really are. to. In this connection we would invite attention to the second of Sir Ceci^f Spring-Rice’s despatches quoted in paragraph 6 above, viz., No. 168 of the 24th July last. He points out that adequate information will prevent unnecessary! \ scares such as that of 1900, when exaggerated rumours of the arrival of reinforce- \ ments in Russian Central Asia necessarily led in this country to serious alarm that could have been avoided, had there been a system of intelligence, such as / Captain Smyth has now established, to determine the real extent and nature of these movements. t 1 11. It wall be seen that the views expressed by the Government of India in their despatches, Nos. 170 of the 1st December 1904 and 135 of the 19th October 1905, and now repeated, have been endorsed by the present Minister at Tehran, by his immediate predecessor and by the Consul-General, Meshed. Nor have our representatives in Persia been led by events subsequent to the Russo-Japanese war to consider the necessity for the retention of the Military Attache at Meshed to be in any way less urgent. In these circumstances we would ask that the decision, conveyed in your telegram of the 25th February last, may be reconsidered. The abolition of this appointment would, we apprehend, lead to a return to the same state of affairs as formerly existed, in which information could only be obtained in a perfunctory and incomplete manner. The valuable work of the last three years would be undone, and the organization established, if now destroyed, could be restored only after the expenditure of much time and labour. 12. We have so far dealt with sub-head (a) of paragraph 1 of this despatch. Our second recommendation that Captain Smyth should be retained in his present post until the 20th October 1908, is based mainly on the desirability of maintaining during the early stages of the entente the happy personal relations which this officer has succeeded in establishing with Captain Skouratt, the Russian Military Attache, and M. de Klemme, the Russian Consul-General at Meshed, and with other Russian officers and officials in Central Asia, This year Captain Skouratt invited Captain Smyth to accompany him to the manoeuvres of the 1st Turkistan Army Corps, and made the necessary applica tion to the authorities at Tashkent ; the request was supported by a private letter from M. de Klemme to the Political Agent at that town. Captain Skouratt application, however, could not be granted, for, owing to the ^mploytiient . r: VARY REGIS* RY ] \ 25 MOV. 1907 5 1 -V*- Ir f: V \ * /v rr i V*/ 4»w »of half the troops in guarding the railways and towns against revolutionary out breaks and outrages, none but minor manoeuvres were to take place this year. Possibly the invitation may be renewed next year. It would be a matter for reeret if we were not in a position to utilize such a favourable opportunity of establishing closer personal relations between the officers of the two armies and of thus removing the attitude of mutual suspicion and distrust which has unfortunately been characteristic of our dealings in the past. ^ Incidentally too, such an invitation should afford occasions for acquiring information of the progress in training, organization and equipment made by the troops in Russian Turkistan since the war.

I understand that the appointment of the mili tary attache at Meshed comes to an end in October of this year.I venture again to bring this question to your notice, as I consider that it is important that the post of military attache should not be sup pressed. I am not of course competent to form an opinion on military matters, but from the political point of view I venture to urge that it is important that this Legation should receive accurate informa tion as to military and political affairs in Central Asia, as the proceedings of the Russian Authorities in that region form a valuable indication as to Russian policy in Persia. It is evidently desirable that the collection of this information should be in the hands of a special officer who can devote all his time to intelligence work. I am the more confimed in this opinion by my recollection of the confused Sir Edward Grey, Bart., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.T I I confused and contradictory news v/hich reached this Legation in 1900 at the time of the transfer of 2,000 Russian troops from the Caucasus to Central Asia. Had the present system been then in force the true nature of this movement would have transpired at once, and would have prevented an unnecessary scare. I venture to add that should an agreement he arrived at with Russia, it will he most important (to quote your words) to have clear and accurate information as to 'the spirit in which the agreement is observed' and for this purpose it is essential that you should retain evei'y possible means of forming a correct judgment. And it is evident that among those means, the reports of the Meshed military attache will not be the least valuable. c (Signed) I have &amp;c. Cecil Spring Rice,PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 16. No. 1. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received July 8.) Gulahek, June 12, 1907. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch, with ficiosures, which I have received from Major Sykes, His Majesty’s Consul-General at jdeshec on the subject of zones of influence in Persia. 'With regard to his suggestions as to a change in the present Consular repre sentation of Russia and England in this country, I venture, with all due deference, to point out that this question is one which deserves very careful consideration. I do not suppose that any objection, on political grounds, could be urged by Russia against our present arrangements for Consular representation at Resht. A Vice-Consul without a Consular guard, charged with the duties of making Commercial Reports and looking after the interests of the numerous British travellers on their way to and from Europe, cannot be regarded as a menace to Russian interests. At Tahreez it might be fairly urged that the dignity of a Consul-General is rather excessive for a British Consular Representative in a district where British interests are not of much importance and those of Russia considerable. As to Turbat it might also he urged that a British Consul is not needed. But at Kermanshah we should certainly require a trustworthy informant, and a Representative empowered to support the very considerable and possibly growing interests of British trade. If \ With regard to Meshed I venture to urge, though it is not in my province, that | as a centre of military intelligence it is most important. I agree also with Major C'l „ '1 ^ ^-V -ay. y. &gt;-v H «/-»/-* ^T\ 'Wl ▼* fl T' O /~\ T /~\ 'T' J TT (1 S~\ T' L-i 1 /-J trade in Khorassan would he, it would seem, a sufficient justification for the main tenance of the post. With regard to Russian Consular Representation, there would he no sufficient justification in asking for the abolition of the Consulate-General at Bushire, a port which we acknowledge as outside the zone of our exclusive military interests. The troublesome and mischievous activity of the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas might afford a good pretext for asking for the abolition of the post—at least on its present scale—and a similar justification might be found in our recent experience in asking for the suppression of the Russian Consulate in Seistan. With regard, however, to Bunber Abbas, the Russians might urge that they have commercial interests there in view of the periodical visits of Russian commercial vessels. On the whole it would seem that we could with advantage offer to reduce our Consulate-General in Tahreez in exchange for a reduction of the Russian Consulate at Seistan, and we might also offer a similar concession in Turbat against the reduction of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas to the rank of a trading Consul. Experience, however, proves (in the matter of the Bombay Consulate-General) that the Russian Government attaches great importance to the retention of its “ Political ” Consuls, and negotiations, if entered into, would probably be of long duration. It is obvious, however, that the operations of Russian Consulates, like those at Bunder Abbas and Seistan, are a constant source of difficulty, and whether or no they promote Russian interests, constitute centres of intrigue against Biitish interests, and are likely to remain so whatever may he the official policy of the Russian Foreign Office. the Bagdad Railway is completed the importance of Kermanshah will be greatly increased.

WITH reference to the information contained in the Memorandum for Mard 1907 re zones of influence in Persia, I have the honour to make the followr observations in the hope that, owing to my local knowledge, they may be oKsr use 2. The spheres referred to in the Memorandum have evidently been drawn up the two Powers from entirely different points of view. Pussia frankly takes tp whole of Central and Northern Persia as her zone, and assigns herself less op eastern boundary of Iran only because of British susceptibilities. A.s it is, practical.^ the whole of Persia which is worth having falls into the zone of the northern Powe^ Her ultimate progress to the Persian Grulf is also not arrested definitely in any way^- so far as is apparent. Moreover, Germany will, presumably, learn the result of these negotiations, and may consider that South-Wbst Persia has been left free for the nf hp.v “Weltnolitik.” However, this has no doubt been foreseen and exercise of her fc Weltpolitik. guarded against. With the exception of the inclusion of the Province of Ispahan and its dependencies (e.g., the Bakhtiari tribes), which question has been raised by the Government of India, there is only the question of Pezd, on which I propose to remark. Yezd is undoubtedly, from, one point of view, situated in the centre of Persia, and consequently it may be argued that we have no business there. On the other hand, it is south of the Lut, the great desert of Persia, and but 220 miles to the west- north-west of the city of Kerman, the only important town in the British zone of influence. Consequently, if the line could be drawn from Ispahan to Kakh, or some other point, so as to leave Yezd in the neutral zone, I anticipate that there would be less trouble in the future, in case of certain possible eventualities. Indeed, unless this be done, there will be little or no neutral zone in Central Persia, the Yezd Province marching with Kerman. I do not refer to trade considerations, which are, after all, of minor importance, although the fact that they have had to yield to more important considerations is not likely to be appreciated by Messrs. Lynch Brothers and other British firms. To conclude this side of the question, Kakh, one of the places mentioned, will be referred to in connection with the sphere of influence claimed by His Majesty’s Government. 3. To turn to the British sphere, it is evidently based on the irreducible minimum or our strategical requirements, and, with an Empire as enormous as ours is to-day, and the only one in Europe not supported by a nation trained to arms, a more ambitious share is clearly undesirable from the widest aspect of the problem, however regrettable when viewed from the standpoint of local .advantage and commerce. In this connection, I have the honour to attach a copy of my letter dated the 29th June, 1900.* In it, seven years ago, I ventured to point out that Eastern Persia was vitally necessary to India, whereas Western Persia was of less importance. In short, I have accurately foretold what is actually being done at the present time. I also venture to inclose an extract from my letter of the 29th September, 1899,* in which I described the immense strength of the Kain position. The plan I have not sent, as it is printed in Captain Napier’s “Military Beports on Southern Persia,” published in 1900. My maps, too, have been printed, and include almost the whole of the north of the Kain Province, on the scale of 4 miles to the inch. Finally, I give an extract from my letter of the 18th December, 1899, in which the strategical importance of Eastern and South-Eastern Persia is detailed.* In this connection I would again earnestly venture to point out that I am still impressed by the immense value to India of the Kain Province, which is bounded to the north by the very range of hills on which Kakh is situated. If possible, I would urge that, if Kakh must be retained by the Bussians, Kain should be declared to be in our zone. Otherwise, future developments may bring about a boundary, meeting at the city of Net printed. ritaomi] J, II CO! w serve as A copy1 , which would be most undesirable.

Military Department. THE RIGHT HON’BLE ST. JOHN BRODRICK, HIS MAJESTY’S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. Simla, the igth October 1905 . 'Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No 23-Political, dated the 10th March 1905, on the subject of the proposed aDDoint.’ ment of a military attache at Meshed. ^ 2. In recommending the creation of this appointment we expressed the hope that His Majesty’s Government would agree to an equal division of the cost between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. With your despatch under reply is forwarded correspondence on this subject with the Foreign Office, in which it is stated that half the cost of maintaining the three Indian officers ' already sta tioned at Tehran and Meshed is borne by His Majesty’s Government although their reports and diaries deal mainly, and in the case pf Meshed, almost exclu sively, with matters primarily affecting India. The appointment of an additional officer at Meshed is considered to be one of purely ..Indian interest, and in view of this fact and of the considerable increase in expenditure in regard to Persia lately incurred by His Majesty’s Government, Lord Lansdowne does not’, it is stated, feel justified in approaching the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in the matter. In these circumstances you have remitted the question for our further consideration. 3. After carefully reconsidering the matter we are of opinion that even if it be eventually decided that Indian revenues should bear the whole cost, the creation of the appointment of an Intelligence Officer as a military attache at Meshed is very necessary so long as Russia occupies her present position in Central Asia. The marked improvement in the extent and value of the informa tion we have received through Meshed since the military attache was provision ally sent there, fully justifies the additional expenditure. So long as we are en tirely without any consular or other representative in Russian Central Asia, we must depend for our information regarding Russian military movements in that region very largely on our Meshed Agency, and Lord Kitchener strongly urges that we should do everything in our power to develop and extend our intelligence system there. In this opinion we entirely concur and recommend that the ap pointment of military attache should be created on the conditions as to salary, etc., stated in our despatch No. 170 of the 1st December 1904. 4. With reference to the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to participate in the increased expenditure, we would invite attention to paragraph 242 of the report of Lord Welby’s Commission where it is stated that the charges of the Mission and consulates in Persia should be evenly divided between the Home and Indian Governments, neither Government creating or adding to the establishments and services under its control without the consent of the other. This broad principle was laid down with the express object of preventing discussions similar2 to the present one. We submit, therefore, that if it is agreed that the appoint ment, which appertains to a sphere in which there are joint Imperial and Indian interests, is desirable, the distribution of cost should follow the principle laid down by the Commission, and that no question can arise as to which party is the more directly concerned. As to the necessity for the appointment we have already stated our own views, and as observed in Sir E. GorsCs letter of i ith February 1905 enclosed with your despatch of the 10th March 1905, we may claim to be “ well qualified to judge of its expediency.” We would accordingly ask that His Majesty’s Government may be invited to consider the matter further as contem plated in the last paragraph of Sir E. Gorst’s letter already referred to. If it is agreed that the appointment is required, but His Majesty’s Government demur to the charge being equally divided, we would request that the matter may be referred to an arbitrator, in accordance with the procedure contemplated in paragraph 362 of the Report of Lord Welby’s Commission.

Secret.) / « My Lord, V ^ Meshed, September 9, 1905. IN my despatch No. 113 of the 22nd May last I had the honour to inform your Lordship that I proposed, after my contemplated visit to Meshed, to report more fully to your Lordship than I then felt able to do, on the question of the maintenance there of a Military Attache. 1 have satisfied myself from what I have seen of the work here that it is impossible for the duties now devolving 1 upon Captain Smyth to be properly performed either by the Consul-General or by the Indian &lt;£ Political Attache,” who acts as the latter’s Oriental and Diplomatic Secretary. The business of the Consulate-General at Meshed is very heavy: its mere regular routine, the Indian accounts, the requirements of the Consular guard of sowars, the work in connection with the upkeep of its extensive buildings, and the ordinary correspondence on current matters, such as the every day cases and affairs of the British Indian Colony and pilgrims, not to speak of Afghan and other proteges, both with the Persian authorities and the Government of India, quite apart from the Political and Intelligence Reports, keep the ordinary staff busy from 9 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m. every day, longish hours in an eastern climate, and it is rare that they have a whole holiday on Sunday, though since Major Sykes has been in charge he has endeavoured to arrange that their Sunday work should terminate by noon. The political work, properly so-called, at so important a post of observation and centre of Russian activity as Meshed, absorbs all the time which the Consul-General can spare after the supervision of the routine business above described, and much of it is done by the Indian Attache, who has to keep in close and regular touch by personal intercourse with the Governor-General, the Shrine officials and other local authorities, and to manage under the Consul-General’s orders the Persian Political, as distinct from the Military and Russian Secret Service Department. I have no hesitation in saying, from what I have seen here, that as the work increases, more, rather than less, assistance is required by the Consul-General, and that it would be impossible for him to combine with his present duties the efficient discharge of those now performed by the Military Attache. The question which has therefore to be considered is whether, especially now that the political situation in Asia, which existed when I last had the honour to address your Lordship on the subject, has been modified by the conclusion of peace between Russia and Japan, it is necessary to maintain at Meshed an Intelligence Department for Central Asia. I am inclined to answer this question in the affirmative, at any rate for the immediate present. It is possible that the most important part of the work, which is now done by the Military Attache here may, at no distant date, be performed by a British Consul at Tashkend. I believe that the appointment of such an officer has been for some time past under consideration, and that the Russian Government have not refused it in principle, though they have attached certain conditions to it. It could obviously not well be opened afresh so long as the Japanese war was raging, but if the conclusion of peace is followed by a de'tente in the relations of the two Powers in the Middle East, it might perhaps be advan tageously rediscussed. A British Consul at Tashkend, who would presumably be a^ military officer, would be able, without depending upon the reports of spies, whom, as he would be very closely watched at least at first, he would have to be very careful about employing, to furnish much of the information as to the strength and move ments of the Russian troops and other military matters in Central Asia for which the Government of India and Intelligence Department must now largely rely on news supplied from Meshed. Until, however, we have not merely obtained from the Russian Government the recognition of a British Consul at Tashkend or elsewhere in Central Asia (I have merely suggested Tashkend as the capital of Turkestan, and as a point more or less equi-distant from the Persian, Afghan and Chinese territories), but have tested by a year or so’s experience the practical possibilities of obtaining through [2155 cc — 5] Bhim all the political and military intelligence, secret as well as easily accessible, which we require, I am strongly of opinion that it would be wise to adhere to the p an o retaining the Consulate-General at Meshed as the head-quarters for our fcecret Intelligence Department in Central Asia. There are many reasons uLieh lead me to this conclusion :— 1 . At Meshed, under the apathetic and not unfriendly rule of Persia it is possible to carry on Secret Service operations with a security which could not exist at any place within Russian territory. , 1 2. Both as a large centre of population and as a holy city, constantly swarming with Mahommedan pilgrims from all the countries bordering on India, me udmg Afghanistan and Russian Central Asia, it affords facilities for obtaining Secre, Agents without attracting any special attention, and through them establishing relations with informants in those countries, and thus spreading, as Captain Smyth is gradually doing, a network of intelligence officers all over the region from which we desire to 3 . The Persians, with all their faults, make on the whole better Secret Service agents than the Afghans or the natives of India. The latter are much more close.y watched bv the Russians. They are, more especially the Afghans, less wily, and more apt to betray their real character. Their correspondence to us addressed to other Persians living on or near the Khorassan frontier, or in Meshed itself, is less 1 ely to be opened than if they were either Afghan or British subjects, and Captain Smyth informs me that none of 'the numerous agents employed by him at various centres in Trans-Cnspia and Turkestan have, up to the present, been detected by the Russians. The weak point in their intelligence, apart from the w r ant of absolute accuracy, which is common to all Orientals, is their technical ignorance as to military matteis, their inability, for example, to distinguish between the uniforms of^ different regiments, different kinds of artillery, &amp;c., but Major Sykes and Captain Smyth believe that this can be, to a great extent, remedied by sending one or two oi the abler among them (which can easily be done without exciting observation) to India, where thev could get the training necessary to enable them to icpoit in a thoioughly trustworthy fashion upon such matters. If the system at which Captain Smyth has been working for nearly two years with results wdiich may, I think, be regarded as successful, is allowed to develop, I venture to hope that we may before long be in possession, through this Consulate- General, of early and full intelligence on every event of political or military interest occurring in Trans-Caspia, Bokhara, Perghana, and Turkestan. Until, therefore, as I ventured to observe, we are able to obtain such intelligence direct through a regular political officer stationed in Russian Central Asia, it would, I think, be a great mistake to relax our efforts in this direction at Meshed. I 'would even be inclined to continue to maintain our Intelligence Department here for some little time after the appoint ment of such an officer. It is certain that a British Consul at Tashkend would, during the earlier days of his appointment, be subject to continuous espionage, that no native other than a British Indian having explicable business with his Consulate, could visit him without danger of arrest or deportation, and that nothing would afford the Russian officials in Central Asia more satisfaction than to catch him out employing spies, and thus have a pretext for demanding his removal. It would therefore be necessary for him at first to walk most warily, to confine himself to reporting those military facts which he could ascertain in a perfectly above board fashion, and to cultivating cordial personal relations with the officers, both civil and military, with whom he would have to deal. Gradually as these got more used to his presence, he would doubtless be regarded with greater friendship and less suspicion, and might, before very long, if a rqpn of tact, be able to mix as freely with all classes, as is the case with our Consular officers at Moscow 7 , Warsaw, and other centres ot European Russia. When this happened it might be possible to suppress, or greatly reduce, the activity of the Intelligence Branch here at Meshed. Under present circumstances, I should myself wish to see it strengthened by the appointment of a subaltern officer as an assistant under-study, and locum, tenens to Captain Smyth. This w r ould be just as cheap in the long run as bringing, when the Military Attache goes on leave, another officer all the way from India to replace him, and w r ould be much less likely to disorganize the rather delicate work he had to do. It would also relieve the Political Native Attache of a good deal of translating and other work which he has now to do for Captain Smyth, and which takes him aw r ay from his own special duties. The above considerations wmuld naturally apply wuth even greater force if the resultn 3 of peace with Japan is to render Russia more aggressive in the Middle East, as the line of least resistance to hei Asiatic amhitions. As to whether this is likely to happen I am, of course, not able to express an opinion. I have the honour to transmit herewith, for your Lordship’s information, in case it should not have reached you through the India Office, a copy of a despatch addressed on this subject by Colonel Minchin to the Government of India, which will give you a fair idea of the cost and working of the present Military Intelligence Branch at Meshed. Colonel Minchin was, I believe, in favour of Making this Intelligence Branch entirely separate from the Consulate-General, so as to '’allow Captain Smjth to communicate directly and independently with the Intellmence Department at Calcutta, without the Consul-General’s being in any way responsible for his work. 1 do not myself think this idea a good one. It appears to me that the Secret Service work, both Persian and Central Asian, is so closely interdependent that both should centre in the Consul-General, and that the reports of the Military Attache, whether dealing within or beyond the frontiers of Khorassan, should be 'supervised by the political chief of the Meshed Mission in the same way as are those of a Military Attache at an Embassy or Legation by the Ambassador or Minister in charge of it. Major Sykes, with whom I have discussed this whole question at some length, who concurs in the views expressed by me in my despatch No. 113 of the 22nd'May, as( well as in this despatch, and to whom I am indebted for several suggestions, notably the one which I have put before your Lordship about the training of some of our best informants in India, is addressing the Government of India in much the same sense. 1 understand, however, from him, and I inferred as much from your Lordship’s despatch Not 63, of the 25th April, that the question is not one for the decision of the Government of India alone, but will form the subject of an exchange of views with the Imperial Government which will be called upon to consider what share, if any, should be borne by His Majesty’s Treasury in the maintenance of the Intelligence Branch at Meshed. It is for this reason that I have ventured, in anticipation of your Lordship’s instructions, to enlarge at some length on this subject. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. •b (7 ^ P.S.—I have the honour to inclose a copy which Major Sykes has just sent me of his report on the above subject to the Government of India. A. H. H. Inclosure 1 in No. 1 . Consul-General Minchin to Government of India. Sir, Meshed, February 9, 1905. I HAVE the honour to address you regarding the provision of a separate office establishment and separate Secret Service funds for the Military Attache recently added to the staff of this Consulate-General. The ordinary establishment of news-agents for this agency is three, viz., at Krasnovodsk, Sarakhs, and Merv. Since the outbreak of the present Russo-Japanese war and the appointment of Captain Smyth as Military Attache of this agency, the number has now increased to nine news-writers constantly employed, besides occasional travelling agents in addition. Captain Smyth also employs a man to read the Russian newspapers to him and causes to be translated any portion of them likely to he of interest. The result has been that the greater part of my Political Attache’s time is taken up with arranging the dispatch of news-writers to Trans-Caspia and Russian Turkestan, their transfer from place to place to insure their safety, transmission of money to them, settlement of their accounts, and more especially with the enormous amount of translation work which has now to be done. My Political Attache, who is my right hand man and by far the most important to me of all my office establishment, is gradually being absorbed from his work by the Military Attache, and the political work of the agency not only suffers considerably in consequence, but my own work, already sufficiently heavy, is thereby muchincreased since the Political Attache is my confidential clerk, and what he has not time to do falls largely on me. It results, therefore, that the assistance m the work 'me iX one lection by the appointment of a Military Attache threatens to be more than neutralized by the loss of my Political Attach^ in another. The Political Attache deals with the large number of Consular cases always on hand with the Governor-General, the Karguzar, the Customs, and the Russian Consulate, and these have lately fallen much into arrears, to the great detriment of our traders here. My Political Attache also accompanies me at the many visits 1 have to pay or receive?he also often accompanies the Medical Officer; he has also to- constantly visit and make friends with the leading Persians and keep himself perfectly iii touch with all classes of people to ascertain what is going on, and last, but by no means least, he has to assist mo in collecting the mass ot information icquncd foi my “'YwotM Srther point out that if at any time the Consul-General were required, to n-o on tour and took his Political Attache with him, the Military Attache s work is liable to be seriously interfered with unless he has a separate ofhee establishment of his own, which, again, he can take with him should he also in his turn require to go Besides, however, absorbing my Political Attache, the increased expenditure by the Military Attache in collecting intelligence falls on my Secret Service lund here, a^ain crippling the political work for which the Consul-General is directly responsible, in short, the more the Military Attache does under present conditions and the more efficient he strives to make his Department, the more he causes inefficiency m the ^ The intelligence ivork of this agency is just at present of the highest importance and even after the conclusion of the present war is likely to remain so. I would ask, therefore, that the Intelligence Branch may be asked to provide the Military Attache not only with an entirely separate clerk of his own, hut also with a separate Secret Service grant. I attach two statements showing what funds are required m this agenev, under the two heads:— i Statement (A) gives the present establishment of news-agents, the pay they receive, and other expenses incurred for purely Intelligence Branch purposes, including a clerk for the Military Attache. The pay of this clerk may seem high, but it must he remembered that he has the lives of our news-agents, or most certain!} their liberty, in his hands and must be a picked man and absolutely trustworthy. Statement (B) shows the present expenditure for political purposes. The present combined Secret Service grant for this agency is 14,40 rupees, hut I would ask that from the 1st April, 1905, the following grants may he allotted ■ The latter would, I conclude, he found by the Intelligence Branch. Captain Smyth is, I understand, separately addressing the Intelligence Branch as to the individual he would wish to be sent here as his clerk. It is for consideration whether His Britannic Majesty’s Legation at Tehran might not be asked to share the above expenditure. The Legation seem quite w illing to place funds for Secret Service purposes at the disposal of the Consul-General here, and though I have not myself asked His Britannic Majesty’s Minister for any money, the latter placed a sum of 300/. at Lieutenant-Colonel Temple’s disposal in 1901— 1902. I would ask that early orders may kindly he passed on the questions raised above. X liave (Signed) C. P. MINCHIN, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, S;c.

(Secret.) gj r Meshed, September 7, 190 ’ WITH reference to Colonel Minchin’s letter dated the 9th February, 1905, to the Government of India, and Sir Arthur Hardinge’s letter dated the 22nd May, 1903, to Lord Lansdowne, I have been awaiting the Minister’s arrival before addressing you on this very important subject. 1 2. I consider that Meshed, as the chief town of North-East Persia, and a holj city visited annually by thousands of pilgrims, is a unique centre for spreading a network of intelligence all over Central Asia. I also hold that it is equally unique as a training centre. In case of the invasion of India by Russia, which is, after all, the only military problem of first-rate importance which confronts the Government of India, the role to be played by the Meshed staff, whether actually at Meshed or not—the Russians might occupy the city—would be one of the utmost importance. Thi is so self-evident that I need not enlarge on it, but will at once come to my point. -I 3. Briefly I recommend that Meshed should be considered to be a field section of the Intelligence Branch, and that its present scale should be expanded with caution but yet with determination. I hold that Intelligence men should not be trained in India, but should bi selected from among our picked agents who have proved their capacity. They coul be sent to India for special training and study of the various kinds of armament &amp;c., and thus be able to report with certainty whether a battery was composed siege or field guns and so forth. They would be encouraged while at their posts t) become proficient in Russian and the languages of Central Asia. If money w forthcoming for this scheme we should be training men to do the same work in pea as in war, and this is universally acknowledged to be extremely desirable. I thii that the results already obtained by Captain Smyth are such as to warrant the presumption that, given a larger budget, still better results may be anticipated. 4. To organize such a corns, and, still more, to secure continuity of working which, Intelligence mechanism, I think Branch that well m my opinion, is vital in handling such delicate assistant in the shape of an officer in the appointed to Meshed. He would, in any case, obtain most valuable training n dealing with all sorts and conditions of Asiatics, not to mention Russians anl might training Belgians. As much of the intelligence work is necessarily of a preparatory nature, surely the milieu of Meshed would be ideal. 5. A translator (on a salary of 150 rupees per mensem, rising to 250 rupees per mensem) should be appointed to this office under the Native Attache. This man would deal with the accounts and translate the numerous letters, besides, of course, assisting in the dispatch of the agents. 6 . In my opinion and that of Captain Smyth, both the Military Attache and the Assistant should be, as is now the case with Captain Smyth, under the orders of the Consul-General. I differ in this from Colonel Minchin, who advocated a separate establishment. Experience is, however, against creating an imperium in imperio, and any separation would, I fear, lead to friction much greater than any that need be apprehended under the scheme outlined by me. At present there is no friction, although the system by which Captain Smyth increases his usefulness at the expense of the Consulate-General is only possible as a temporary measure. In this connectioi I agree with what Colonel Minchin has written on this subject, and would refer his full and lucid explanations. 7. I also agree as to the Secret Service budgets being separated, with the reser vation that one budget be allowed to aid the other, if in a position to do so. Of course if my views be accepted the cost would be greater than at present, but, in my opinion, no money could be better spent. The lessons of the recent war constitute an indisputable proof of the above. 8 . I have not alluded to the possibility of the establishment of a Consulate Tashkend affecting the position at Meshed. If founded no intelligence system could be worked from it—at any rate for some years—as the Consulate would be full of informers and watched by the secret police. Moreover, men working from a pilgrim icor ?4r The Under - Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India, and is directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, further section of confidential correspondence, as marked in the margin.

His duty is to collect intelligence, primarily military, but also political, from Transcaspia, Turkestan .Dokliara, Herat, and other regions of Central Asia in which we have no public Agents ' and copies of his reports to the Government of India are regularly transmitted to your Lordship through His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran. The expenses oi his mission are at present, I believe, entirely borne by the Government of India, and I presume that it is now contemplated that his position should be regularized. r ir 1 am T T ot sufficiently acquainted with the nature and amount of the work fallnig to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed to express any decided opinion as to whether in normal times he could unite with his ordinary functions the duties now performed by Captain Smyth. I hope in the course of the summer to visit Meshed and inform myself fully as to local conditions there. But I should be inclined to think a prion, that the ordinary routine of the Consul-General’s work and the general superintendence of British and Indian interests, political and commercial, in the vast province of Khorassan would leave him very little leisure for the special business at present devolving on Captain Smyth. What your Lordship and the Government of India, I imagine, want at Meshed is an intelligence office, which can obtain for you full, early, and reliable particulars of all military movements and political events in Russian Central Asia and on the Russo-Afghan frontiers, similar to that which Sir Reginald Wingate used to procure when I was in Egypt for the Cairo War Office from Omdurman, and, indeed, from the whole Soudan. Now this, I think, is work which, if it is to be properly and thoroughly done, requires the concentrated and undivided attention of one man, and cannot well be combined with the daily multi- . farious duties of the Agent and Consul-General at Meshed, though it would naturally be supervised by the latter officer. I am further of opinion that, at any rate while the Russo-Japanese war lasts, there is always a possibility of trouble, owing to a variety of easily conceivable causes, in the Middle East, and that it may be of consider able importance to British and Indian interests—which are, after all, identical—that we should be accurately informed of all occurrences and prepared for all possible contingencies in Central Asia. Meshed is, for these purposes, the best and nearest post of observation, and if, as seems probable, the war lasts for some time longer, I do not believe that money spent on the continued maintenance there of a capable officer for the purposes described above need be regarded by Government as thrown away. I should therefore welcome the continuation of Captain Sn&amp;fh’s more or less informal appointment as Military Attache at Meshed, at least till the termination of hostilities in the Far East, and the allocation to him, whether from Indian or British revenues (it being beyond my province to express any opinion on this point), of whatever sum may be found necessary to procure the complete and early intelligence desired. Further than this I would not at present venture to go. The close of the war may greatly modify the entire political situation in this part of the Asiatic continent, [2030 in — 4 ]and the question of the permanent appointment of an ^gfull^re- Asia, under the designation of Military Attache at Meshed, my examined of this despatch&gt; f or any observations to offer on it, to the Government of India and to His Majesty s Consul-General in Khorassan. _ 1 p I have, &lt;xc.

Lord Lansdowne notes that the appointment In question is strongly recommended by the Indian Government and Commander-in-Chief, who are well qualified to judge of its expediency. I am, however, to observe that an officer of the Indian Army is already attached to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran as Military Attache, and that two more Indian officers are stationed at Meshed, as His Majesty’s Consul-General and Vice-Consul.

I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,To THE RIGHT HOVBLE St. JOHN BRODRICK, HIS MAJESTY’S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. Fort the 1st December 1904. Sib, We hate the honour to forward a letter from the Quartermaster- General in India in which sanction is asked for the appointment of an Intelli gence Officer as a military attache at Meshed. 2. Lord Kitchener considers such an appointment a necessity, and in this opinion we entirely concur. We have no Agents, Consular or otherwise, in Central Asia, the nearest Consul in Russian territory being, it is understood, at Batoum. We are consequently obliged to rely on native information, which, unless very carefully managed and sifted, is frequently unreliable. Meshed is practically the only place from which reliable information of Russian movements and preparations can he obtained, and a military attache if appointed could organise and develop a system of intelligence by reliable and tested agents. We, therefore, desire strongly to recommend the proposal for sanction as one calculated to improve our present system of gaining intelligence. 3. Until recently, the collection and reporting of intelligence regarding Russian military movements have been left entirely to our Consul-General, who, however, is too fully occupied by his political and Consular avocations to allow of his devoting as much time to this important question as it undoubtedly deserves. During the past summer, we have enjoyed the advantage of the presence in Meshed of an officer attached to the Indian Intelligence Branch, who had been deputed on a roving commission to Khorasan and Trans-Caspia; since June last he has been temporarily stationed at Meshed, where he has to a large extent relieved the Consul-General of this special branch of his duties and with the best results. I. The military attache if appointed would be a member of the staff of, and under the orders of, the Ccpul-General at Meshed, but would correspond direct with the head of the Intelligence Branch at Simla, who would, subject to the approval of our Eoreign Department, give him instructions from time to time. Arrangements would be made by the Intelligence Branch at Simla for any special enquiries from Meshed which the general staff in London might require to be made at any time.A I ,• i A. 5. We propose that the pay of the appointment should be pay of rank plus Es. 450 per mensem staff pay and exchange compensation allowance, and travel ling allowance on the scale allowed to political officers stationed in Persia. This remuneration is, in our opinion, more suitable than granting a separate local allowance and by no means too high having regard to the high cost of living in Persia. 6 In asking for sanction to the creation of the appointment of a military attache at Meshed on the terms proposed, we would strongly urge that His Majesty’s Government should bear half the cost, with reference to the principle laid down in your predecessor’s Political despatch No. 107, dated the 15th November 1901, that an even division of charges and not a separation of spheres of interest is to regulate expenditure in the maintenance of Consular and diplomatic establishments in Persia, which principle, we consider, may fairly be applied in the present case. The officer appointed will be a military attache at the consulate, and His Majesty’s Government will participate in the advantages which will accrue from the collection of intelligence regarding Russian military activity and resources in the regions bordering on Persia. A line can hardly be drawn between military and political affairs in Persia, and it is evident that the information collected would be of an immediate political as well as of potential military value We trust, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government will agree to an equal division of the cost between the Imperial Government and the Government of India.
