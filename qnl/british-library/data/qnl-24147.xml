The Bahrein end of the causeway will be connected by military personnel, the whole to form a IOIARRAQ- MANAI'tA civil Junction, The present I.TUhARRAQcivil Junction will then cease. (b) Provide an overhead pair from the Bahrein end of the causeway to the present BGAC building* Connect this pair to the existing civil Jetty pair which terminates halfway along the BGAC Jetty, and extend the latter pair to the new BOAC Jetty building. This will provide a direct MIHARRAQ-BOAC Jetty pair* All connections from the Bahrein end of the causeway towards Muharraq will be done by military. (c) Extend the existing MUHARRAQ-30AG pair (now on civil overhead) to the present A.L.O.’s building, whence an underground pair will be allotted by military to provide a MUHARRAQ—BOAC Junction. (d) Provide 2 overhead pairs from Cable &amp; tireless to the new BOAC building then cease existing GAEL- &amp; ''/IR^^SS - BOAC pair. % (e) cease existing Manama Civil-RAP Rest House circuit as such, extend this pair at the Rest House for approximately 2 bays to the military un&amp;ergrouni in the Rest House so as to provide a MANAMA CIVTL-BOAC Junction, (f) Cease remaining and existing BOAC^LAIIAMA civil Junction.

Reference orrespondence (P.A f s Letter No.C/434 dated 7th April, 1945 and enclosure). I leel that as these new telephone lines are purely B.O.A.C ./R.A.F. the v;ork should be carried out oy the Army (R.C. of 3.). In any case, //e have not got the essential material available and this would have to be provided by them. I 11 accordance with precedent all power lines simi larly erected automatically become the property of the Government of Bahrain. In the present case the existing lines from R.A.F. Muharraq to the Manamah nxCiiunge, B.O.A.C., and A.L.O's house are the property of the R.A.F. It does not^appear to be a reasonable proposition tnat any alterations or additions now required should become the liability of the Government of Bahrain. I intimated this to Major Butler and Captain Sincox during a discussion in my office on 15th March 1945, and it was then understood that the R.C. of 3. would carry out the work if we were unwilling to do so. It is recommended that the Officer Commanding RAF Station, Bahrain, may be notified that we are unable*to take action as requested for the reasons stated S.Z.CONFIDENTIAL. (?)
