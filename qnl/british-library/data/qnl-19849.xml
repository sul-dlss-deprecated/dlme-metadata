In addition, 244 miscellaneous petitions were dealt with by the Court# The disproportionately large number of suits dropped by plaintiffs is due to the extremely large floating popula tion of the Islands, attracted by the diving industry. Defendants frequently leave the Islands after a suit has been filed against them, by means of country dhows, thus evading service of summons. The number of Criminal Cases dealt with by the Court shows a decrease, compared with 1921^of 208 cases and a decrease in the number of convictions of 39.
