Bahrain By Captain D. L. R. Lorimer. Kuwait By Captain .W. H. I. Shakespear. Several changes have taken place during the year. Mr. H. Whitby Smith was relieved, in March, by Mr. R. C. Campbell, on whose retirement, in July, Mr. R. C. Barker, C.I.E., assumed charge of the Mekran Coast. Major Haworth, on return from furlough, assumed charge at Mohammerah vice Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, who was placed on special duty. Captain A. J. H. Grey succeeded Lieutenant J. G. L. Ranking in May, on the latter's transfer to the United Provinces for training. Captain D. L. R. Lorimer took over charge at Bahrain in April vice Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., who relieved Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., at Maskat, the latter proceeding home on furlough. The Resident was directed, in November, to proceed to India to attend His Majesty's Coronation Durbar and left Bushire for the purpose, on 27th November. On the occasion of the Durbar His Majesty was graciously pleased to confer on him a Knight Commandership of the Indian Empire, whilst Major F. B. Prideaux and Major A. P. Trevor of the Political Depart ment, Mr. Whitby Smith, Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs and Political Officer, Mekran Coast, and Mr. E. C. Gregson, Assistant Superintendent of Police, on special duty in connection with the Arms Traffic, all received the Companionship of the same Order, the recognition of good work performed in the Persian Gulf. B2 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The Resident remained in India after the Durbar in connection with various Gulf questions under consideration by the Government of India, and did not return to headquarters as Bushire until early in March. The position of affairs in the Capital i ,. , . „ . and in the Provinces continued to go General situation in Persia. i? i i j. irom bad to worse. A substantial loan was indeed obtained by the Persian Government from the Imperial Bank of Persia in May, after lengthy negotiations, but the money soon went, and there has been little left to show for it. The proceedings of the Treasurer-General, Mr. Shuster, and events following the return of the ex-Shah and his brother, the Salar-ed-Dowleh, occupied the attention of the Central Government during the early part of the year; while later the despatch of large bodies of Russian troops to Tabriz, Kazvin and Meshed, her subsequent ultimatum to the Persian Government and our own action in strengthening our Consular Guards at Bushire, Shiraz and Ispahan, afforded plenty of material for demonstrations against Russia and newspaper and other forms of agitation against foreigners in general. Meanwhile the control of the Central Government over the distant Pro^ vinces, had become weaker and weaker, and at the end of the year the posts of Governor and Governor-General were for the most part unfilled through Southern and South-Western Persia. Interest in the affairs of the south was mainly focussed on the situation Fars and the south. at and on the Bushire-Shiraz road. The year began with the appoint ment of Nizam-es-Sultaneh as Governor-General, and it was hoped that he might be able to restore the situation to some extent for the Persian Govern ment. ^ But such hopes were destined to be disappointed. He started badly by throwing himself too much into the arms of the Kashgai Ilkhani, Sowlet-ed- Dowleh, and the violent remedies, including a treacherous murder, upon which they Jointly embarked for the settlement of the Province and the furtherance of their personal ambitions, proved the undoing of both. By the end of the year both had retired from the stage, while their opponent and intended victim, the Kawam-ul-Mulk, after a narrow escape and six months' sanctuary in the British Consulate, found himself, in the absence of a titular incum bent, de facto Governor-General of the Province. The events leading up to these developments are sufficiently dealt with Increase of British Consular Guards and the P th€ Bushire an d Pars report, but there attack on consul Smart. is one pregnant point connected there- i.i, , w ith which may be usefully noted here, namely, tiiat, whereas the increase of the guards was suggested by His Maies- ty s Minister m consultation with the Resident, expressly with a view to the protection of occasional British caravans on the trade routes concerned, after an authoritative preliminary explanation of our intentions to the headmen interested, yet when the measure was ultimately ordered to be put into execu- tion, it was expressly stated that it was undertaken purely for the better Fw e l 10I l British Consulates and subjects at the centres named, and tnat the troops would not be used for escorting caravans. The stipulated preliminary communication to the headmen was consequently never made. In past time the attitude of the inhabitants of Fars and the Gulf Ports had never been actively unfriendly to Indian troops as such, but unfor tunately at the present juncture, several circumstances, or developments, and a great deal of Mullah and newspaper agitation by papers like the ' Habl-ul- Matin had combined to generate a feeling in Islam of antagonism to Christendom in general, and m Persia of violent resentment against Russia tor her action in Northern Persia, and in a less degree against us in the south on account of our apparent concurrence in her doings and the suspicion that we had sinister designs m regard to the south. ™ n F v r r ® as0D ?' and owin g to the unfriendly vapourings of local Mullahs at the time, it was a little doubtful whether the squadrons of the Central India Horse and their horses would be got safely ashore at Bushire without opposition. Accordingly, considerable precautions were taken toPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 3 provide against anything of the sort, and eventually the opposition was limited to an attempted boycott which soon broke down. The attack on Mr. Smart and party just before the end of the year was no doubt due partly to this general feeling of hostility, but more immediately to the alarmed cupidity of the nomad Chief in whose sphere it took place. After a good many years of stagnation and hope deferred, the present „ j i * • ^ twelve months has witnessed encourag- Political and economic developments in the • - it . . Gulf sphere generally. mg developments m several directions, both political and economic. Among the former category I may mention the framing of an Order in Council for Bahrain, and the opening of negotiations with the Porte for a give-and-take settlement of our conflicting interests in Turkish Arabia and the Gulf, while the economic category includes the serious discussion of railway projects both in Turkey and Persia; the improvement under our auspices of the light ing and buoying of the Persian Gulf, and the installation by us of a system of wireless telegraphy. I will touch briefly on each of these topics. The Baghdad Railway. —This project has undergone consideration, Rail development, and some modification. On the one hand, as the result of the 'Potsdam Interview,' Russia came to an agreement with Germany whereby the former undertook to construct a line from Tehran to Khanikin, while the latter agreed to join this system with the Baghdad one by making the branch connection with Khanikin or conceivably by bringing the main line through Khanikin. Russia undertook to obtain a concession and start work on her line within two years, failing which Germany would have the right to take her own steps to obtain a transfer of the concession. Almost simultaneously the German Company notified the surrender of its rights under its general concession to construct the section south of Bagh dad, stipulating only that its share in the new Company formed to construct this portion should not be less than that of the group representing any other nationality. The questions of the formation of the new Company and the respective shares to be held by the several elements interested were still under discussion and negotiation at the end of the year. Meanwhile the general trend of British and foreign opinion is towards the ultimate selection of Basrah as the main terminus rather than Kuwait. The Trans-Persia Railway. —This scheme, which was actively boomed in Russia early in 1911, may be said to have come within the region of prac tical politics. In the past the attitude of British opinion towards such a project has been one of suspicion and disfavour mainly on strategic grounds. But it was held that the progress of the Baghdad Railway and its aspect from the Indian point of view, combined with the readiness of Russia to accept a strategically innocuous alignment, precluded our longer maintaining an attitude of active disfavour towards the project. His Majesty's Government has, therefore, consented to co-operate with Russia for the systematic investigation of the project from an economic and engineering point of view, while reserving to itself full liberty to regulate its final attitude towards the project by the light of the results of those investiga tions. Meanwhile, it may be mentioned that the alignment favoured by the Russian group is via Kerman to Karachi, while the British view inclines towards a more southerly alignment from Yezd, touching the coast at Bandar Abbas or Charbar, and following the coast thence to Karachi. Luristan Railway. —This project, which contemplates a line from Mohammerah to Khurramabad with ultimate extension northwards into the Russian sphere, was definitely pursued during the year, and the Persian Government actually approached with a request for a concession. The request was not, however, pressed at the time as the Central Government could not be induced to contemplate the spheres of influence created by the Anglo-Russian Convention, and objected to consider a railway in a form which involved recognition of them. b aADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Since then their attitude in this connection has assumed a less uncom- promising aspect, and it may soon be possible for us to return to the attack. Meanwhile, a preliminary examination made in the spring of 1911 by Lieutenant A. T. Wilson indicated that the project offered no insuperable difficulties from an engineering point of view, but the result of the investiga tion of its economic possibilities by the Board of Trade and Government of India somewhat discounts the favourable opinions expressed by British capitalists. Railways in Fars.- —An application by a group of capitalists, headed by Mr. C. Greenway, was made to the Persian Government for a concession tor a project including lines from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz and Mohammerah, and Bushire to Shiraz. Negotiations were well advanced when they were abruptly terminated owing to the dismissal of the Treasurer-General, Mr. Shuster, who had been charged by the Persian Government with the negotiations. They have not since been resumed. The investigation prosecuted by Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, in July and August, of the possibilities for a connection between Bushire and some point on a Bandar Abbas-Shiraz alignment near Jahrum indicated that no serious engineering difficulties existed, but threw doubt on the prospects of such a connection, as a commercial speculation. During the year a modified scheme, involving less capital outlay than that originally put forward by the Lighting and buoying in the Gulf. Lighting Committee of 1905, was laid before His Majesty's Government with a view to immediate inception. Up to the end of the year their formal sanction had not been received to the scheme as a whole, but meanwhile the existing buoys and beacons were taken over from the British India Steam Navigation Company and spme of the simpler recommendations of the Committee carried out, including a close and accurate survey of the Shatt-el-Arab Bar and the approaches to Kuwait and the provision of a gas buoy at the outer bar, the channel of which was fully re-buoyed during the year. Unfortunately our action in this direction was anticipated by a few days by the Turks, owing to the absence of any information as to the prac tical steps the latter were taking to carry out their announced intention to make their own arrangements for buoying the bar. Their preparations to this end included the leisurely construction by Indian rivetters in their work shops at Basrah of several large buoys the existence of which was only known to His Majesty's Government a few hours before their conveyance to the bar. The Jask installation continued to work satisfactorily, and a temporary installation was also effected at the Wireless installation. House at Rish ehr, without any opposition on the part of the Persian authorities who indeed freely made use of the facilities afforded. The comprehensive scheme for the Gulf generally, which was under the consideration of His Majesty's Government during the year, had not received final sanction up to the close thereof. In the hope of arriving at an amicable settlement of the many items of conflicting interest existing between egotiations wit e one. Great Britain and the Porte in Turkish Arabia and the Gulf, after some preliminary pourparlers a memorandum was presented to the Turkish Government, in July, giving a frank exposition of our claims and requirements both in regard to the Baghdad Railway, the status of Kuwait and Gulf questions generally. Negotiations were commenced during the year, but had not made much definite progress, and unfortunately, while His Majesty's Government studi ously avoided in the meanwhile any action in the region in question calculat ed to disturb the status quo or Turkish sensibilities, the Turks on the contrary lost no opportunity of endeavouring to better their position for negotiation by hurried attempts to modify the local status quo in their own favour.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOE 1911. 5 The lawlessness which characterised Luristan and the hinterland last Lin ah year was fully maintained, although Saiyid 'Abdul Husain Lari did not take a prominent part in public affairs. The activity shown by the Navy at the upper end of the Gulf in connec tion with the Arms Traffic favoured the growth of anti-foreign feeling, which was stimulated by the reports of Russian aggression in the north. Up to the end of the year, however, this feeling had not evinced itself in any violent form, although throughout the Gulf the existence of it added greatiy to the difficulty of maintaining normal relations with the local Rulers. Nabil Zia, the Turkish Consul at Bushire, visited Lingah in August, .and without any reference to Mr. New (who is in charge of Turkish interests at that port), enrolled some 400 persons as being under Turkish protection, 40 of whom were given papers of Turkish nationality; nearly all the latter were, however, subsequently recovered from the holders by the Persian Gov ernment, and as the result of representations made on the subject to the Porte by His Majesty's Government, Nabil Zia was removed from his appoint ment. It is to be regretted that, owing to the continuance of wholesale smug gling and the insecurity of the routes between Lingah and the hinterland, .British firms have had a disappointing year and have been unable to make any progress. The Bandar Abbas-Kerman road, upon which the trade of the port Bandar Abbas almost entirely depends, was unsafe during the greater part of the year, and British goods to the value of over 14,000 Tomans were stolen by brigands; it is satisfactory to note, however, that except for the case of Mr. Gabler of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, no Europeans were molested on the road. Suggestions for the restoration of order upon this road, as well as upon the Bushire-Shiraz road, were put forward in October by the Resident, but His Majesty's Government decided to confine application of remedial measures for the time being to the Bushire-Shir az road experimentally, and the proposals, which included the distribution of a cavalry regiment between Bandar Abbas, Bam and Kerman did not take shape. A raid by Baharlu tribesmen from Ears into the district, in August, and rumours of an intended attack upon the town led to the reinforcement of the Consular Guard, but, as is generally the case, the tribesmen failed to make good their designs upon the town, and, towards the end of the year, the guard was reduced to its normal proportions. It is noteworthy that the Arms Traffic, which His Majesty's Consul reports to be increasing in volume along the Shibkuh Coast, has, at Bandar Abbas as well as on the Mekran Coast, become greatly attenuated. Captain Biscoe's remarks under the head of ' Local Government' afford some indication of the difficulty which our Consular Officers too often encoun ter in endeavouring to effect the settlement of any question locally, owing to the constant changes and general incompetence of Persian officials, whose authority, never robust, has now been reduced to almost vanishing point throughout Southern Persia, The incident described by Captain Biscoe touching the visit of the ' Persepolis ' to Bandar Abbas with a force of tufangchis despatched by a well-meaning Governor, with the ostensible object of keeping order, deserves special notice as an illustration of the incapacity into which the Persian administration in the Provinces has fallen. The existing mail service to and from Bandar Abbas has not been found to work satisfactorily, but a revised time-table was under contemplation at the end of the year, by which Bandar Abbas will benefit considerably. Lieutenant-Colonel Haig's report is a record of continual disturbances in Kerman and anarchy in Baluchistan. Indeed he points out that Western Baluchistan may be considered to have definitely emancipated itself from the control of the Central Government, and that its re-conquest will be a matter6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP of some difficulty; the position is little better elsewhere in Southern Persia, from Kerman to Kermanshah, with the exception of Arahistan. It is of interest to note that the anti-foreign demonstrations consequent on Russian action in the north, which unfortunately were at their height at the time of the Coronation Durbar, were promptly suppressed by the new Governor-General, Prince Amir-i-A'zam, and cordial relations between Persian officials and the Consulates resumed. The large number of British subjects now reported in Arabistan or on the oil-fields (614 British Indians and Atabistan - 78 British subjects) is the best indica tion of the progress of British industry in the Province, which alone in Persia has remained in its normal state of contentment and peace throughout the year, thanks to the firmness and ability of Shaikh Sir Khaz'al Khan s regime. His attitude to British interests generally has left nothing to be desired, and it is satisfactory to note that his officials have now followed his example, a development which shows how fully the Shaikh and his people realise what they owe to the steadfast friendship of the British Government. The general expansion of business consequent upon two good harvests was unfortunately discounted by a virulent epidemic of cholera, which reached Mohammerah from Basrah and spread northwards to Ahwaz and elsewhere, exacting a heavy toll not only from the indigenous population, but from a detachment of Indian Cavalry on its way back to Ispahan, and on the small European colony of whom no less than seven died during the year. Amongst the indirect effects of the epidemic must be reckoned the delay in completion of the Oil Company's refinery at Baraim, due to the appearance of cholera there. The career of the Ittila'-ed-Dowleh, the representative of the Persian Foreign Office in Mohammerah, is a typical one of some general interest; like most of- his class he was frankly venal, but while Karguzar at Bushire his propensities in this direction being reasonably satisfied in one way or another, he was practically helpful to British interests. Failure on our part, how ever, to give him effective support when in difficulties, partly on our account, with another Foreign Consulate, resulting in his transfer to Mohammerah, brought about a complete change of demeanour, and from the moment of his translation to Mohammerah all his endeavours, both diplomatic and journal istic, were directed in the channels most calculated to harm our interests and strain our relations with the Central Government in regard to matters of policy in the south. Finally, however, he overreached himself, lost his post, and left for Kermanshah, where he ultimately figured in the tale of those hanged by the Salar-ed-Dowleh, on his recapture of Kermanshah. The determined attitude taken up by the Shaikh on the question of Monsieur Zwinne's return to Mohammerah deserves note, as also does the compromise effected with the assistance of His Majesty's Legation, with regard to the posting of a Belgian Customs Director to Ahwaz, a step to which the Shaikh gave his consent, after a useful and not unneeded assertion of his position, and in return for a payment of about £500 a year by the Customs. The effect of the stand made by the Shaikh in these matters has been to give a new lease of life to his Customs firman, which Belgian Customs offi- cials had been too apt in the past to regard as obsolescent. Major Haworth gives an interesting summary of the Shaikh's relations with his tribal neighbours, particularly with the Bakhtiaris, whose increas ing identification with the Central Government he, in common with other tribal Chiefs, greatly resents; the spectacle of a Bakhtiari Prime Minister and Minister for War (and a Bakhtiari as candidate for the post of Trea surer-General vice Mr. Shuster) practically controlling the Cabinet and utilising the resources of the Government to promote their own interests, greatly increased the tension which has long existed between the parties; and the absence for the greater part of the year of any Governor-General at Shushtar added to the difficulties of the position. Luckily the Shaikh is well able to look after himself, and has the undivided support of all the Arabfo POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. tribes in the Province, and the maintenance of peace in Arabistan seems to depend rather on the continuance of this state of affairs than on any self- denying agreement between the parties, whose interests seem fundamentally irreconcilable. The chain of circumstances which led the Shaikh to take active measures to ensure the Nizam-es-Sultaneh's safe arrival at Mohammerah after his departure from Shiraz, illustrates the close interdependence of the affairs and personalities of Fars and those of South-Western Persia generally, and emphasizes the necessity for avoiding any local action which may bring opposing interests into acute issue. Captain Grey's report, which deals with Luristan, the Bakhtiari country, Ahwaz and the Kuhgilu tribes, is less pleasant reading than the above; at the close of the year Luristan, Arabistan, and Fars (including the Governorship of Behbehan) were all unprovided with Governors-General, nor was there any prospect of appointments being made. The incursions of the Salar-ed- Dowleh threw Luristan into the slough of anarchy from which Amir Mufa- khan had been attempting, with some measure of success, to raise it, and quarrels between the Wali and his son disturbed Pusht-i-Kuh. The absence of the chief Khans, and the continued detention of the bulk of the Bakhtiari forces, at no time too numerous, in Tehran and elsewhere, reacted unfavour ably on the security of the Ahwaz-Ispahan road, which suffered severely from the attacks of the Kuhgilu tribes, British goods to the value of over £10,000 being stolen. Internal dissensions also made their appearance, and further lessened the ability of the Khans to keep order in their own territories, and at the close of the year no action had been taken by the Khans to prevent a repetition in the following summer of the previous year's anarchy. An effective blockade was maintained throughout the year by the Royal Persian Mekran Coast. NaV ^ ^ nd . ther€ Wa S Consequently a great slump in the quantity of arms and ammunition imported into Persian Mekran; the Afghans, taught by the losses which they suffered in 1910, came to the coast in comparatively small num bers, and confined themselves to the purchase of arms from Baluchis; apart from the Arms Traffic question, there is little that calls for special notice in the Report, but mention must be made of the difficulty which Mr. Barker has experienced in inducing the Baluch Chiefs to pay approved claims, and it seems plain that we shall be obliged to deduct the amounts from their sub sidies, unless we are prepared to see our representations wholly ignored. Mr. Gumbley's report includes a record of the movements of the Mekran Field Force, which operated from Sirik and Galag under Lieutenant-Colonel Delamain. Whilst its immediate objects were attained, the action then taken has unfortunately brought us no nearer to the solution of the difficulties resulting from Mir Barkat's continued existence in the country in a state of outlawry. The Indo-European Telegraph Department have, as usual, rendered most valuable co-operation in the task of combating the Arms Traffic, and it is most satisfactory to see at length the visible and anticipated effect of the operations which have been conducted at such enormous outlay to Govern- ment. Taking up the thread from last year's review, I may say that the ' Arms Maskat Traffic ' continued to behaze the Maskat horizon. The hoped-for settlement of the question with France has, as heretofore, failed to take shape, and our rigorous blockade operations have continued, with the result that, while the most important part of the traffic, that to the Mekran Coast and the North-Western Frontier, has been practically killed, the importations into Maskat have not decreased, and the traffic has become diverted to the northern part of the Gulf. Here, as in the south, it has aroused all the piratical instincts latent in the character of the maritime inhabitants of the Gulf, and brought about a state of general demoralisation, the evil effect of which pervades every community, and enters into every question.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF In the spring, negotiations with France being understood to have come to nought, suggestions were made to the Government of India that the time had come for a review of the position. It was decided that it was still advisable, if possible, not to break with the Sultan, but to make another attempt to induce him, pending settlement with Frfm 0 ®* to give £8 w o e- hearted co-operation in the endeavour to reduce the traffic to its legitimate dimensions. This policy was approved in principle by His M a]estys Gov- ernment and the Resident was ultimately authorised to have a straight talk with His Highness the Sultan and endeavour to induce him, m return tor a substantial increase in his subsidy, to agree to introduce, as a municipal measure of internal administration, an arrangement under which all arms imported into Maskat in future would be deposited m a special Customs magazine and only issued under a system of license and strict registration. Although-himself preferring the alternative (at present impracticable UI1 ^ Treaty) of total prohibition, the Sultan, after several days discussion with the Resident and Political Agent, in November 1911, signified his acceptance in principle of the Government of India's proposals, m return for an increase of one lakh of rupees per annum in his subsidy and the payment of a lakh i cash down. Negotiations for the elaboration of this scheme were still m progress at the conclusion of the year. Negotiations for the renewal and revision of the Commercial Treaty between Great Britain and the Maskat State were also started during t e year; but with the Sultan, reduced to a most difficult and irritable frame ot mind as the result of the abnormal state of affairs produced by our Arms Blockade, the satisfactory settlement of the numerous new points for discus sion in the new Treaty was found to represent an extremely difficult one tor a newly-arrived Political Agent to tackle. It was therefore decided between His Highness and the Resident and generally approved by Government that the old Treaty should be considered in force for a period longer, up to two- years if necessary, during which the various points for revision would be taken up leisurely as suitable opportunities offered. It is proposed to proceed therewith as soon as the more urgent negotiations in connection with the Arms Traffic have terminated. „ , . ^ ^ The affairs of Oman pursued the usual tenour of their way and call tor no special comment in this review. His Highness, like the Shaikh of Kuwait, and other notables of the Gulf, was undoubtedly disappointed at not receiving an invitation to His Maiesty's Durbar at Delhi, but the reasons for the inability of Government to extend the invitation to Potentates beyond India was duly explained to him and when the time came he co-operated cordially with the Political Agent m celebrating the occasion in Maskat. His son, Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, who it will be remembered attended the Durbar in 1903 on behalf of his father, took the trouble to proceed to Bombay to have tne honour of witnessing Their Majesties arrival. At present the general situation on the Trucial Coast constitutes a political nettle which will need to be Trucial Oman. firmly grasped before long, but which in the meantime it is difficult to handle gently with impunity. Several causes, some local, some general, have combined to produce these conditions; firstly, we have had to reckon with the after-effects of the Debai incident ot December 1910, and the impression which has since got abroad that the resolute attitude of the inhabitants of Debai on that occasion successtully deterred the British Government from pursuing measures for the consolida tion of our influence on that coast which we then had in contemplation; secondly, we have seen an inconvenient development of the Arms Traffic problem presented by the transfer of the bulk of the trade from the Oman- Mekran region to the Upper Gulf, with the Trucial Coast as the main centre of radiation, a development which is now subjecting the Shaikhs and people of the Trucial Coast to the same process of rapid demoralisation which we have already witnessed in the cases of Maskat and Southern Persia. Lastly, the Trucial Principalities have not been immune from the anta gonising influence of the spirit of pan-Islamism which has for some time pastPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 9 been disturbing the Mussalman world generally, and which has been specific ally enlivened lately by exaggerated newspaper accounts of Italian action in inpoli and Eussian doings in Northern Persia, for which latter we-ourselves ve incurred a considerable share of odium. None of these influences will necessarily be permanent, but they are sufficiently potent while they last to add greatly to the difficulties of our task in the Gulf. It is encouraging to record, however, that at the end of the year, pro posals for the early installation of a wireless station and the issue of an Urder in Council for the Trucial Coast were under lively consideration, with a view to strengthening our control over this part of the Gulf. j ^ bu J ^- U f a dispute with the German Government remains unsettled, but further investigations were pressed during the year, ending in the presentation by us to the German Government of fresh arguments on oenalt 01 the Shaikh of Shargah and a proposal for settlement by compromise which it is hoped will prove acceptable and effective. The Bahrain report for the year conveys a somewhat gloomy picture of Bahrain the condition of the Principality, for which I fear there is a good deal of foundation. The position is undoubtedly difficult and unsatisfactory, and as it is primarily due to the incompetence of Shaikh 'Isa as an administrator, there is not much hope of material improvement as long as he lives and con tinues to manage or mismanage his own affairs. As it is, a great deal of work and worry devolving upon our Agency results from the attempt to perform in the interest of the public, without adequate machinery, functions which should properly appertain to the local administration, were it reason ably efficient. The coercion which we were driven to apply to him in 1904-05 enabled his first Political Agent, Major Prideaux, to do an immense deal towards the consolidation of our general position at Bahrain, but all substantial progress in the direction of good and enlightened administration is hampered at every turn by the bigoted incapacity of the Shaikh; to which factor has of late been added another, namely, the influence of the nationalist sentiment which has agitated Islam for the last two or three years, and which, gathering force from the trend of events in Turkey and Persia, has made itself felt in Bahrain as well as other ports of the Gulf. But the particular difficulty which has loomed largest on the Bahrain horizon throughout the year and continues to do so at its close, as it did last year, is the unsatisfactory work ing of the cargo-landing arrangements. On the occasion of his visit, in March 1911, the Resident had found the various interests involved in the question all pulling in different ways, and after discussion with Shaikh Tsa he arranged to send over Mr. Chick, Com mercial Adviser to the Residency, to preside at the meetings of the merchants and endeavour to bring the different elements to an understanding. This course, however, proved abortive as the local Arab merchants got it into their heads that Mr. Chick had come to favour the foreign element and merely offered obstruction, from which Shaikh Tsa was too ineffective to discourage them, and no satisfactory solution had been reached until the departure for Delhi of the Resident, who remained in India to the close of the year. It is probable that Government will eventually have to intervene in the interests of our shipping and impose some arrangement upon the Shaikh, but before making recommendations in the direction, it is intended to make one further attempt, in consultation with the Shaikh and the Political Agent, to induce the former to take some reasonably effective action calculated to avert Government intervention. This it would be inconvenient to take just before the introduction of the Bahrain Order in Council, now under contemplation, which, it is hoped, will soon receive approval in its final form and come into operation without fail during the coming year. It is pleasant to turn from the record of Bahrain to that of Kuwait, Kuwait where a much more healthy administra tive atmosphere prevails and pervades the Annual Report.10 ADMN.

Birdwood, who reverted to the post of Second Assistant, relieving Lieutenant E. Noel, 44th Merwaras, who had officiated in that post since April, on the departure of Captain J. S. Crosthwaite on furlough. Captain C. B. McConaghy, I.M.S., performed the duties of Residency Surgeon throughout the year. Lieutenant G. G. James, I.M.S., was deputed, in August, by the Government of India, at the request of the Residency, as Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Officer, and was stationed at Mohammerah, where a severe outbreak of cholera necessitated his presence. Mr. Vice-Consul Chick held charge of the Vice-Consulate throughout the year, being assisted in his duties by Mr. Newton Worrall, Consular Assistant. Mr. Acting Consul Smart was relieved, in February, by Mr. Acting Consul Knox, who held charge of the Shiraz Consulate until the end of the year, Mr. Smart's return being delayed by the attack upon his escort near Kazerun, as related elsewhere. Monsieur Kadloubousky held charge of the Russian Consulate-General till April, when he was relieved by Foreign Representatxves. Monsieur Dmitrieff. Nabil Zia Bey held charge of the Ottoman Consulate until relieved in September by Aguiah Bey, under circumstances detailed in the report of the Lingah Vice-Consulate. Dr. Listemann held charge throughout the year of the German Vice- Consulate, which has lately been raised to the status of a Consulate. Mr. A. H. Wright, Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, took over from Messrs. Wonckhaus' representative the charge of the Norwegian Vice-Consulate, in August, and retained it until the close of the year. On the departure of Monsieur Heritte on sick leave, in April, His Majesty's Consul-General took charge of the French Vice-Consulate, includ ing Dutch interests to the extent that the French Consulate is responsible for them. Governor. —Mirza Ali Muhammad, Muwaqqar-ed-Dowleh, a Persian m . 1 of Bushire origin, arrived from Shiraz Persian o cia s. almost without warning, on April 8th, on appointment as Governor of the Gulf Ports vice the Darya Begi. The latter was advised to accept the situation without opposition, but, owing to the equivocal attitude of the Persian Government towards him, he was so suspicious of the intentions of his successor and apprehensive of a night attack on his house, most of his servants having left him, that he took refuge for the night previous to his departure in the First Assistant's house, pro ceeding on the following day on board a steamer bound for the Shatt-el-Arab, en route for Tehran. Muwaqqar-ed-Dowleh had given every satisfaction to His Majesty's Consulate, Shiraz, as Karguzar there, where he was a close friend of tho Kawam and a bitter opponent of the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, Kashgai. Although he had been several years Karguzar of Bushire and was on terms of personal friendship with the Resident, he was known to be a person of violent likes and dislikes, and his appointment at the present time was therefore not altogether welcomed, owing to the prominent part he had c ft12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF played in the Kawami-Sowlet feud and his bitter hostility to the latter and to the Governor-General, 1SI izam-es-Snltaneh, facts which made it inevitable that Bushire and its affairs would now become involved in the torried poli tical intrigues chronically emanating from Shiraz. Another unfavourable augury of his advent was that he seems to have owed his appointment partly to the patronage of the Muin-ut-Tujjar in Tehran, and could consequently not be relied upon to take an independent line of policy. The manner of his shaping will appear from the body of the Eeport. Governor-General of Fars. —Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who was appointed Governor-General of Fars towards the end of 1910, arrived at Bushire by mail of the 10th January. He was met by Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, Ilkhani of the Kashgai, who, accompanied by a large force of his tribe, had come to Bushire to welcome him. The presence of a considerable body of undisciplined tribesmen in the island was a source of some anxiety to the Residency, but although they occasionally gave trouble by trespassing in the compounds of European residents, their conduct was on the whole unobjectionable. Nizam- es-Sultaneh left Bushire for Borasjun a fortnight later, but at the end of February had not got further than Kazerun as his energies were mainly directed towards recovering the arrears of rent due from the extensive tracts which he owns near Daliki, as well as arrears of revenue from Tangistan and Dashti. After more or less unsuccessful encounters with Zair Khadhar of Tangistan and Khurshid Beg of Kamarij, he arrived early in April in Shiraz with a force of some 150 horsemen, chiefly Kurds and Lurs. After many vicissitudes, which are related elsewhere, he was finally dismissed and left Shiraz in October en route nominally for Arabistan, of which Province he had been appointed Governor-General, though the appoint ment was cancelled almost as soon as made. The circumstances of his escape to Mohammerah in November with the assistance of Shaikh Khaz'al are touched upon in the Arabistan Administration Report. Rukn-ed-Dowleh and, shortly after him, Farman Farma were succes sively nominated by the Central Government, but it was apparent from the first that neither candidate had any intention of assuming the responsibilities of office. Early in November 'Ala-ed-Dowleh, who had twice previously held the post with some success, was appointed with a great flourish of trumpets, and lost no time in telegraphing instructions to his nominees in Shiraz assuring them of his intention to leave Tehran shortly for the south, in com pany with Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, Kashgai, the Bakhtiari nominee for the Ilkhaniship of that tribe. His procrastination, however, deprived his nomi nation of much of the wholesome respect which his name at first inspired in the breasts of the population of Shiraz and proved his undoing, for he was assassinated at Tehran in December. At the close of the year no one had been found to fill the breach, and the Central Government had no option but to appoint Kawam-ul-Mulk tempor arily to the position, though much against his wishes. Mirza Ghulam Ali Khan, Saad-es-Sultan, held the post of Foreign Office Agent until October, .when he was transferred to Shiraz in the same capa city, his place being taken by Mas'ud-es-Sultan, younger brother of the Governor Muwaqqar-ed-Dowleh. The conduct of both officials was reason ably satisfactory and afforded no ground of complaint to the Residency.

In an altercation m the bazaar the Deputy Chief of Police was insulted by one of the gunners, whereupon the former drew a revolver and killed the latter on the spot. He then fled,f POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOB 1911. 13 pursued by the other gunners, with the intention of taking sanctuary in the Eesidency; finding the gates closed (the day being an office dies non), however, he hurried to the Turkish Consulate where only a Persian gendarme was present at the time as caretaker. The crowd forcibly entered the premises and shot the Deputy Chief of Police down. The gendarme, who had appar ently tried to save the refugee, was found to be mortally wounded as also waa an onlooker among the crowd. The Turkish Consul, Nabil Zia, naturally made much of this ' violation of the Consulate ' and took advantage of it to ask his Government to furnish him with a proper Consular Guard. This result was, however, averted by the conciliatory action of the Persian Government in offering a full apology and paying the sum of Tomans 1,500 demanded as compensation by the Turkish Consulate for the family of the gendarme who lost his life. Nabil Zia was removed from his post soon after this as the result of our complaints regarding his extraordinary action in giving to all and sundry at Lingah certificates of Turkish nationality. His successor complained bitterly to the Resident of Nabil Zia having taken unto himself the whole of the compensa tion above referred to! Monsieur A. Constant held the post of Provincial Director of Customs Customs throughout the year. Smuggling was as rife as ever, and it is now quite beyond the resources of the Department to cope with it seriously. A repetition of the murders of Customs Mudirs in 1910 occurred at Shivu in August, when the Mudir at that place was killed by his tufangchis. Captain C. B. McConaghy, I.M.S., held the post of Chief Quarantine niiaT , Q , xt • i * Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf Quarantine and Residency Hospital. ., i , i i throughout the year. Memoranda on the working of the Quarantine Administration in the Gulf and of the Resi dency Hospital are attached (Appendix I). Bushire Anjuman. —The local Anjuman or Town Council remained in Local Government. a ^ of suspended animation though- out the year, its abolition being officially; decreed in November by a circular telegram from the Central Government addressed to all Persian Governors directing the abolition of all Anjumans and entrusting Governors with power to inflict punishments on their own authority. Anjuman-i-Baladiyeh. —This body, which constitutes the Municipal Council of Bushire, displayed great activity at the beginning of the year in levying various taxes, some of which were disallowed by the Central Govern ment. Others, such as a tax on horses, donkeys and beasts of burden gene rally, were much resented locally by the donkey-pedlars who supply Bushire bazaar with local produce, and they protested against the imposition with some success by striking. The Anjuman was suppressed in April as a result of the disturbances at the Turkish Consulate referred to above, but was reconstituted in July on the initiative of the Governor. It was again abolished, in common with other Anjumans, at the close of the year. The 'Adliyeh. —The Governor organised a special court known as the 'Adliyeh during the year for the disposal of civil cases, court-fees being met by an advance payment of 10 per cent, on the amount of the claim. Local Police. —The experiment, referred to in last year's Report, of placing the local police under the Rais-i-Nazmieh, an official appointed by the Central Government, was not a success; this luminary, faced by the necessity of keeping his department in funds, commenced to levy taxes on spirits and opium, besides assisting the Municipal Council in levying other imposts; the Kalantar of Bushire resented this active encroachment on his preserves, and a good deal of ill-feeling was aroused, which culminated in the firing of two shots into the Residency Munshi's house at night, whilst, on the following night, an armed policeman was caught climbing over the wall of the Turkish Consulate. Both incidents were believed to be due to the desire of one party to embroil the other with foreigners. But the most serious outcome of the14 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF activity of the police in levying new taxes, without the co-operation of the Kalantar, was the murder, within the precincts of the Turkish Consulate, of the Deputy Chief of Police, already referred to. The origin of this incident was an attempt on the part of the gunners, many of whom are also petty traders in private life, to induce shopkeepers to close their shops as a protest against the proposed taxes, in order to frustrate whicn the Deputy Governor' and Deputy Chief of Police went to the bazaar and remonstrate with the malcontents, with the results already recorded The unpopular position of the Rais-i-Nazmieh was suppressed as a result ot the incident and has not been revived up to date. Local Garrison. —The local garrison remained during the year in its usual state of inefficiency. The force which left Bushire m August ot the previous year, owing to the non-receipt of their salaries, were not replacea till May, when 300 sarbazes under an officer arrived from Shiraz. arrived with considerable arrears due to them and continued to receive their pay at Bushire very irregularly, if at all, though at the same time the Governor forbade them to follow : the usual practice of Persian soldiery, and eke out their exiguous salary by petty trading. The result was that, early in December, a party of 340 sarbazes with 20 of their petty officers took bast under the Residency flagstaff (as was done in August last year), stating that they had not been paid for 14 months. The Governor was approached unofficially, and a sum of 7,000 Tomans extracted with much difficulty and paid to the sarbazes, who left sanctuary a fortnight or so later. Later on, not having received their claims m lull, some of them gave the Turkish Consulate a turn and took bast there, and were still giving trouble to that Consulate and the Residency by their importuni ties at the close of the year. Thirty gunners arrived in May, in relief of a previous detachment, but appeared dissatisfied with their lot, and seven of them had disappeared by September. Fifty Persian sowars also arrived from Shiraz at the end ot April for duty; their fortunes were the same as those of the sarbazes referred to above, with whom they acted in concert. The year was marked by exceptional unrest and local tribal conditions Condition of Bushire and surrounding dis- WCTC the CaUSC of Considerable anxiety tricts. towards the close of the year. The attempts on the part of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh to recover arrears of revenue from various local Potentates disturbed the whole countryside, and, in the result, left the various recalcitrant Khans, such as Zair Khadhar and Jamal Khan, in a stronger position than before, a state of affairs which the failure of the Central Government to appoint a successor to Nizam-es-Sultaneh has now stereotyped. The proscription of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, and the abortive decree of confiscation against his lands, kept the unrest alive throughout the autumn, and, in November, a more serious state of affairs supervened in connection with the landing of a regiment of Indian Cavalry at Bushire, en route to enforce the Consular Guards at Shiraz and Ispahan, and the protection of British lives and property at those places, and in particular at Shiraz. It was an unfortunate coincidence that this step synchronized with the strengthening of the already large bodies of Russian troops located at vari ous points in the north of Persia, and was closely followed by a threatened Russian occupation of Tehran and the outbreak of serious, if unofficial, hostilities in Tabriz between the ' fedais ' and the Russian troops; whilst, in Europe, Italy had simultaneously declared war upon the Ottoman Gov ernment in Tripoli and thus, together with France and Spain, became engaged in sanguinary hostilities with the Muhammadan tribesmen along the southern littoral of the Mediterranean Sea. It was unfortunate too that our Consulate at Shiraz, by being compelled in the spring to give ' bast' to the Kawam, had become in the eyes of the Kashgai faction in Fars pledged to his support; as in consequence of this there was a widespread belief that the ulterior object of the arrival of British troops was to attack the Kashgai and curb the uncontrolled license which they had for some years enjoyed. Apart from this the apprehendedPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 15 restoration of order on the roads by the use of our sowars, involving, as it would do, the loss of a source of blackmail which the various Khans along the road have come to regard as a permanent one, was naturally viewed by the interested parties with undisguised, if passive disfavour. The Khan of Borasjun, Ghazanfar-es-Sultaneh, who, in 1909 {vide Administration Report), made himself conspicuous by his discourteous treat ment of a detachment of British troops en route for Shiraz, now took an active part in anti-foreign intrigues, and though he made no attempt to interfere with the first party of 2 squadrons, which went up the road, in November, he must be held in some degree responsible for the hostile attitude adopted by the tribes further up the road to the second party, which culmi nated in the attack of December 24th. It is interesting to note here that, during this unrest, Haidar Khan of Hayat Daud kept aloof, as far as is known, from any sort of anti-British propaganda and in his conversations with Haji Rais-up-Tujjar of Mohammerah, who visited him in connection with the endeavour to effect the safe conduct of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh from the neighbourhood of Daliki to Mohammerah, he adopted a discreet and satisfactory attitude, saying that it was not worth his while to take sides one way or the other or to do anything to bring himself into conflict with the British authorities, on whose good faith he relied and whose good-will was a valuable asset which he was anxious to retain. The situation at Shiraz dominated the political horizon of Fars and indeed of South-Western Persia gene- Disturbances at Shiraz. ralIy ^^ghout the year, almost to the exclusion of other questions. The number of important personalities in volved, and the interdependence of the forces at work in Shiraz and Tehran make it extremely difficult to give in a moderate compass an intelligible resume of the complicated intrigues of which the Province was a victim, and of the anarchy which resulted from their miscarriage. It seems best to commence by enumerating very briefly the principal personalities involved, and their political predilections. Nizam-es-SultaneJi had been appointed Governor-General of Fars in order to restore order on the roads, in the hope that by so doing he might render unnecessary the execution of our intention, adumbrated in our note of 1910, to take measures ourselves with that object. He was an able but unscrupulous man; a close friend of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, in touc^i with the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh; and with a large stake in Fars, as in Arabis- tan, in the shape of extensive and valuable estates. Whilst himself not definitely hostile to the Bakhtiaris (as were his friends the Shaikh and the Wali) his interest generally tended to run counter to theirs. With the Kawami family he was from the first persona largely, it is said, for family reasons, his forbears having occupied a subordinate, if not a menial, position under the ancestors of the present Kawam-ul-Mulk. But when at Bushire he repeatedly assured the Resident, as he had the Shaikh of Mohammerah a few days previously, that he was fully alive to the fact that his only chance of solving the problems of Fars was to find a modus vivendi between the Kawam and the Sowlet and to render himself independ ent of both. The latter's action, however, in coming to meet him at Bushire upset his calculations, and he found himself committed, before he parted company with Sowlet, to the acceptance for the time being of tht offers ot co-operation adroitly thrust upon him by that Chief. He went a step further in this direction before arriving at Shiraz in appointing Kashgai nominees to the Governorships of Behbehan and Dashtistan, whereby he provoked the active resentment of the Bakhtiaris as well as of the Kawamis. He lett Bushire, however, with every intention, it seems, of serving British interests to the best of his ability, and if his acts subsequently took an anti-British turn, it was due rather to the miscarriage of his carefully laid plans than to any deliberate intention in that direction. Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, Ilkhani of the Kashgai, and an old enemy of the Kawami family, as will be seen from the Shiraz Administration Reports for previous years, commanded at the beginning of the year the support ot tlie16 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF bulk, but not of the whole of the tribe, and in addition was reputed to be very' wealthy, having for several years collected, but withheld from the Central Government, the tribal revenue for which he was responsible. As a tribal leader he resented the predominance of the Bakhtiaris in the Coun cils of the Central Government and it was this feeling, shared as it was by many other tribal Chiefs, which alone lent any reality to the so-called ' League of the South/' which consisted of a paper alliance between the Shaikh of Mohammerah, the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh and the Royalist faction of the Bakhtiari Khans. He owed the position of Ilkhani to birth rather than to superior natural abilities, being related through his mother to the principal factions of the Kashgai, whereas his rival, Zaigham-ed-Dbwleh, though older, was by a mother of inferior position. But though without commanding ability, his ambition was boundless, and he aimed at occupying the same predominant position as a tribal Chief in the political arena of Fars, as the Shaikh of Mohammerah and the Bakh tiari Khans do within their respective limits. He sought to encompass this end by the adoption of a policy of protecting the trade routes which would gain him our active support, and which would give him the local predomi nance at which he aimed. Apart from questions of policy involved, and his ability to make good his promises, the advent of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh as Governor-General, charged expressly with the restoration of order, and supplied with fuiids for the purpose, made it impracticable for any response to be made at the time to his independent proposals for securing the safety of the roads; which he put forward at Bushire, in January, and endeavoured unsuccessfully to pursue, in April, with His Majesty's Consulate at Shiraz. His Majesty's Minister instructed Mr. Knox in this connection to let Sowlet know that such proposals could not be entertained, but that he might count on our good will provided that he maintained a favourable attitude towards British claims, and assisted the Governor-General in the maintenance of order. Sowlet-ed-Dowleh did his best to secure the predominance which he sought by assisting the Governor-General, hoping in this way to make him self indispensable and to remove his enemies through the agency of the Nizam. He nearly succeeded, for the latter freely accepted this assistance, though doubtless well aware of Sowlet's ulterior motives; for, shortly after the murder of Nasr-ed-Dowleh the Nizam assured His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz that as soon as he had broken the power of the Kawami faction, with the aid of the Sowlet, he would not fail to turn his attention to the latter. The Kawami brothers. —The Kawam-ul-Mulk and Nasr-ed-Dowleh were the heads of the Kawami clan, the premier family of Shiraz, who for several generations had occupied a position of influence under successive Governors. Their father Muhammad Eiza Khan, Kawam-ul-Mulk, in parti cular, had acquired considerable wealth and great influence and had more than once officiated as Governor-General. Constitutional ideas, when they became popular in Persia, served in Shiraz, as elsewhere, as a rallying cry for 0 - se&lt; ^ ^ ie P owers be which happened at the time (1908) to be embodied in the person of the then Kawam-ul-Mulk, who was murdered in that year. It was for this reason, namely, that it was anti-Kawami, that oowlet-ed-Dowleh, on his own showing, espoused the local constitutional party, thus throwing the Kawami family into the arms of the Bakhtiaris. The Kawamis had no regular tribal following, though for some years the Khamseh IL had been in their charge; but they were very wealthy land owners, and consequently endeavoured always to ensure that the Governor- General should be on their side; when this was not the case, they endeavoured, generally with success, to make his position untenable by engineering popular disturbances. The Zil-es-Sultan had exiled them, when Governor-General, m order thus to ensure peace, but on his fall they returned and assumed their former predominant position. Both men, particularly Nasr-ed-Dowleh, were men of breeding and cul- nre, not averse to the society of Europeans, and on terms of personal friend- s ip with successive Consuls at Shiraz, a circumstance of which Sowlet-ed-0 POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 17 Dowleli complained bitterly, particularly as Muwaqqar-ed-Dowleh, then Karguzar at Shiraz, and an inveterate enemy of his, was also on friendly terms with the Consulate, with which he himself had latterly ceased to have intimate relations. We may now take up the narrative of events. Nizam-es-Sultaneh Arrert of the Kawamis. arrived at Shiraz, on April 6th whilst . an unsuccessiul attempt to reduce the Chief of Kamarij, on the Bushire-Shiraz road, was still in progress; a week later, after laying himself out to lull the suspicions of the Kawami brothers by every sort of blandishment, he arrested them both by a ruse, on the 15th April, and announced his intention of sending them before a criminal court at Shiraz on various charges, some of which were punishable with death. In the meantime he devoted himself to extracting from them large sums of money and valuables. Any momentary improvement in the situation result ing from this bold stroke was soon counterbalanced, as might have been fore seen, by the resentment which it aroused not only amongst the adherents of the Kawamis in Shiraz, but among the Bakhtiari Khans in Tehran. Sardar Assad at once postponed his imminent departure for Europe, and brought all his influence to bear in favour of the brothers, who, he said, had only stayed in Shiraz in deference to his earnest request, and for whose safety he consequently felt morally responsible. He went so far as to repudiate responsibility for the Ahwaz-Ispahan road, in order to show his disapproval of the Nizam's proceedings. Finding themselves in a dilemma, the Persian Government compromised by ordering Nizam-es-Sultaneh to release the Kawami brothers on condition that they left Fars for Europe; the Nizam resisted these orders for some time, and was energetically supported in doing so by the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh and others, who did their best to inflame public opinion against the brothers; in the first week of May, however, the Governor-General bowed to the inevitable and commenced making arrangements for the despatch of the brothers to Bushire. They left Shiraz on the 7th May with an escort of 50 sowars, and on the Murder of Nasr-ed-Dowieh. same day their party was ambushed about 2 miles east of Khaneh Zinian, the first stage out of Shiraz. Nasr-ed-Dowleh, who was behind, was killed. Kawam-ul-Mulk, unlike his brother (who had been given a mule to ride), was mounted on a horse and was some way ahead. Seeing his brother fall, he at once galloped off, and next day, as had been anticipated, made his way by circuitous routes first to his house in Shiraz and then to the Consulate, where he sought and was granted sanctuary by His Majesty's Consul, who, in anti cipation of the contingency, had obtained the sanction of His Majesty's Minister to this course, should the necessity arise. There is little doubt from what subsequently transpired that the murder was instigated by Sowlet-ed- Dowleh with the connivance of Nizam-es-Sultaneh, It was from the first realized that unless the Kawam could be removed, grave disorders would supervene, but unfortunately no means of doing so without imperilling both his life and property was discovered. It also soon became clear to the Nizam that he had overreached himself, and this being the case, it seemed that he was not unwilling that affairs should take so un favourable a turn that His Majesty's Government might be compelled to intervene; such intervention would, he no doubt believed, serve his own inter ests as one of the principal land-owners in the province. In any case there is no doubt that he commenced to intrigue actively against the Consulate, thus making it impossible for us to make concrete suggestions to the Persian Government for the Kawam's removal. Probably as a direct result of these intrigues, on 10th June, a large body of Persian soldiery, who had on the ^Attempt by Persian soldiers to enter Con- game day demanded arrears of pa y from the Governor-General and received a satisfactory reply, proceeded to the Consulate with the ostensible object of taking sanctuary, as a protest against the npn-receipt of their pay; on being18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF refused admittance they attempted to rush the guard, which consisted of a detachment of the 79th Carnatic Infantry, and some sowars of the 25th Cavalry; in the fracas that followed one Persian soldier was killed and four wounded, of whom two subsequently died of their wounds. The resolute behaviour of the guard elicited the strongest approval of His Majesty s Consul at the time. By the beginning of July party animosities on their side had crystallised; the Governor-General had been bringing pressure to bear on the Kawam s family in various ways; while the latter, led by the Kawam's wife and only son, intizam-el-Mamalik (now Nasr-ed-Dowleh) had retorted by preparing for active resistance; the Nizam threatened to bombard the Kawami quarter within 24 hours, a threat which was replied to by prompt counter-prepara tions on the part of the occupants. Had the Nizam been as good as his word, and had the bombardment been at once successful, he might have rehabilitated himself, but he hesitated, and the delay encouraged his opponents. A week later hostilities commenced in earnest, but with inconclusive results, the casualties being very heavy Fightmg m s iraz. amongst the Nizam's adherents, whose opponents were strongly entrenched behind loopholed walls. The Persian Government shortly after the commencement of these hostilities, which they appear not to have authorised, proposed to dismiss the Nizam in view of the urgent need of placating the Bakhtiaris to whom they were at the moment looking for help in opposing the ex-Shah who had just landed in Persia. No definite action was taken, however, until the end of July, by which time bands of Kashgai had commenced to pillage the villages of the surrounding dis tricts, with the Nizam's connivance, and the forces opposed to the Kawamis also received large reinforcements of Kashgai. The Nizam seemed bent on resisting dismissal, and made a last attempt to secure our assistance by propounding a scheme for making an independent state of Southern Persia, to be formed out of the ' League of the South,'' with other accretions. To these blandishments, however, no response was given, but meanwhile the Persian Government, pjliant as usual, reconsidered its attitude and, on August 9th, announced his reinstatement. Large numbers of Kashgai continued to arrive during August, and in the thir4 week of the month, fighting became continuous by day and night, the results being generally speaking uniformly unfavourable to the Nizam's party. Some attempt was made towards the end of the month to effect a rapprochement between the rival factions, but without result, both sides being too deeply committed, to withdraw. At the same time the various indignities offered by Kashgai tribesmen to Europeans and their servants indicated that the Nizam's forces were getting out of hand; Consulate servants were beaten by Kashgai pickets posted round the Consulate and the com pound of Messrs. Ziegler's Agent at some distance from the town was invaded. On September 7th, a large force of Arab and Baharlu tribesmen entered the town after some sharp fighting and announced to His Majesty's Consul that they had come to avenge the murder of Nasr-ed-Uowleh. They promised protection to the lives and property of Europeans. The following week Sowlet-ed-Dowleh arrived near the city and a strong force of sowars and a mountain gun was at once sent out to meet him. He signalled his entry upon the scene by kidnapping the local revenue officer and prospective Deputy Governor, Mirza Habibulah Khan, and reached the town the follow ing day, shortly afterwards taking up his residence at the Palace with the Nizam, accompanied by an ill-disciplined body of some 800 men. The situation had by this time grown very disquieting, about 1,200 Kashgais being strongly entrenched in the commercial quarter of the town, in hourly conflict with some 1,200 Arabs, and it seemed more than probable that whichever side gained the upper hand would utilize the occasion to loot the town. (It was at about this period that measures for the increase of the Consular escort at Shiraz and elsewhere, in conjunction with measures for the restoration of order on the roads, were taken into lively consideration by His Majesty's Government, with results that are detailed later on in this Report.)JC POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 19 Under instructions from His Majesty's Minister, His Majesty's Consul , , ^ , v at Shiraz warned Sowlet-ed-Dowleh Warning to Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. ^ hig presence and of his tribe3 . men in Shiraz only made for disorder, and that should any harm to British lives and property render intervention necessary, the consequences would be visited on his head. Sowlet treated' this warning with contempt, and a few days later announced that he was about to drive the Arabs out of Shiraz, and that any householder who declined to facilitate the movements of his men through their premises would be held responsible for all damage resulting. The Arabs continued nevertheless to be successful in their encounters with the Kashgai, and even the time-honoured threat of closing the already insecure trade route to Bushire now failed to secure for Sowlet-ed-Dowleh the favours of the merchants, who appealed to Tehran for his dismissal. ' The Karguzar, meanwhile, declared his inability to afford protection for the lives and property of British subjects, for which the dismissed Governor- General also disclaimed responsibility when approached on the subject by His Majesty's Consul through the Karguzar. Fighting went on interrup tedly, and by the end of the month the success of the Arabs was assured, and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, seeing himself likely to be forcibly ejected in the future, endeavoured to come to terms with the Kawam-ul-Mulk, but without result. On October 3rd, His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz warned Sowlet-ed- Dowleh that unless he ♦at once left Further warning to Sowlet-ed-Dowleh and with his men, His Majesty's Nizam-es-Sultanen. ■% f . -it -i tx- -*V • Minister would recommend His Majes ty's Government to take immediate steps to protect our own interests and to visit the penalty for any damage to those directly upon himself and the Nizam-es-Sultaneh. At the same time he informed the Khamseh Chiefs that, in the event of harm befalling themselves and property of British sub jects, His Majesty's Minister would take steps to exact full reparation. On the following day Nizam and Sowlet left Shiraz and camped some six miles away, the latter having publicly Departure of Nizam and Sowlet. ascribed his departure to the action of His Majesty's Government, whilst at the same time threatening to cause dis turbances on the Bushire-Shiraz road; there is little doubt, however, that tribal and climatic exigencies would have forced him to leave in any case. The Kawam lost no time in leaving the Consulate, whence he and his son, , „ „ , , , who had come to meet him, were escorted Kawam-ul-Mulk leaves the Conenlate. by a ^ ^ of Khamseh tr i b e sm en with all their leaders. Intizam-el-Mamalik took a different route to that adopted by his father, a wise precaution, for on his way to the town Kawam- ul-Mulk's party was fired on and sustained some casualties. The Kashgai on their way down to their winter quarters did a great deal of wilful damage to the telegraph line, and for several days telegraphic communication with Bushire was totally interrupted. It is difficult to realise to the full the ultimate results of the six months' anarchy outlined above; the best indication of their severity is the fact that the casualties during the three months are estimated by reliable authorities at not less than 460, whilst many more were wounded; the damage to property was enormous, and in addition tribal enmities have been aroused which can scarcely be forgotten in this generation; while the prestige of the Central Government, at no time strong, seems to have received a blow from which it can scarcely recover. Towards the end of the year, after the arrival of the troops, an attempt was made by some of the leading clerics attXrtot^TSo™ of Per8ia ' a ° d th8 of Shiraz to engineer a run on the Impe- rial Bank of Persia; some inconvenience was caused, but the crisis was successfully tided over and the agitation died a natural death. The same persons endeavoured to organise a boycott of our sowars, merchants in the bazaar being compelled to refuse supplies; this too was of short duration, the troops commandeering supplies and giving receipts % against which payments would be made on application to the Consulate. d 220 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP Until April, the condjtion of the Bushire-Shiraz road was fairly satis- factory, though occasionally closed by Condition of trade routes in Fars. ^ Nizam . s operations at Kamarij, heavy snowfall had indeed rendered it almost immune, until the end of February, from the attentions of raiding parties, whilst after that date the fear of reprisals by the Nizam-es-Sultaneh kept the local tribes from robbing caravans; but frequent robberies occurred between Shiraz and Ispahan and formed the subject of reiterated and energetic protests to His Majesty's Foreign Office on the part of leading Manchester firms; the same who, with equal vehemence, protested against any attempt on the part of Great Britain to take any overt measures to restore the situation. Two robberies were even perpetrated in the sight of the ' Fars Expedi tionary Force' whose commander, however, declined to move against the robbers. So loud at this period were the complaints of British firms, who suggested that they might have to discontinue shipments, that the Foreign Office, at the end of May, suggested that the time had come to insist on the scheme adumbrated in our note of October 1910 being taken in hand, as the Secretary of State found it difficult any longer to refute the arguments of the interested parties. On 7th June, His Majesty's Minister in reply pointed out that, if we pressed our scheme, we would greatly embarrass the Persian Government, whose equilibrium was none too stable; he feared that insistence would have little result and that we must be prepared to undertake measures necessary to compel the acceptance and execution of our scheme, which would probably involve the temporary occupation of the trade routes. Robberies had, as a matter of fact, been few in number during the first part of the year, though the state of the roads was in other ways very unsatisfactory, and trade stagnant, the Customs revenue returns, which showed an increase over previous years, being for several reasons fallacious if taken as an index of the condition of British import trade. The problem of the condition of the roads was, in fact, overshadowed by the developments at Shiraz, for though it might be possible to send up goods from Bushire to Shiraz with safety, the anarchy prevailing in the surrounding districts made it impossible to distribute merchandise, with the result that trade remained at a standstill. In June and July traffic between Shiraz and Ispahan showed a tendency to improve, although the Nizam's authority appeared to be weakening, in September tre Bushire-Shiraz road was parti ally, and in October entirely, closed by disturbances, whilst on the Shiraz- Ispahan road robberies on a large scale were of frequent occurrence. On October 12th, a large caravan with over £2,000 of British goods was „ robbed near Abadeh by Kuhgilu tribes- Case of Miss Ross. j • j j j. j • i ^ * men, and an independent medical practi tioner, Miss Ross, travelling at her own risk from Ispahan to Shiraz, was robbed of everything she possessed. A few days later a body of 300 Persian soldiers was attacked near Yazdikhast, losing 10 killed and 30 wounded. On 30th October, when attempting to continue her journey to Shiraz r Miss Ross again fell into the hands of robbers; her Persian guard fled at sight, and left her to be robbed and maltreated, the robbers even going so far as fr) remove the whalebone from her corset. This repeated outrage brought home vividly to the Press in England the state of the roads in Southern Persia,, and His Majesty's Government subsequently consented to send a squadron of the 39th Central India Horse to Abadeh to escort Miss Ross to Shiraz, where she ultimately arrived in safety. The Bushire-Shiraz road was opened to traffic again in November, though still very insecure; and in the interval between the arrival of the first and second parties of the 39th Central India Horse at Shiraz, two Japanese mer chants who were accompanying a large caravan with, but in front of, a detachment of the 79th Carnatic Infantry en route to Bushire, were robbed. Like the Shiraz-Ispahan road, it was closed again shortly after the passage of the main body of British troops; and, except for the chequered passage of the detachment accompanying Mr. Smart in December, remained, so until the end of the year.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. In the British note of October 1910, the Persian Government were Reinforcements of Consular Guards and pro- warned that UnleSS Order Was restored posed measures for restoration of order on -ji • tt- roads. withm three months, His Majesty s Gov ernment would reluctantly be compelled to take steps to secure the policing of the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan road, and the organisation by British officers serving under the Persian Government of a local force of 1,000 to 1,200 men was foreshadowed. The announcement of Persia's intention to engage Swedish officers to organise a road gendarmerie, and the appointment of Nizam es-Sultaneh with a great flourish of trumpets, was however considered to justify some extension of the respites allowed to the Persian Government. A temporary improvement supervened, in the spring of 1911, due partly to abnormal climatic conditions and partly to the respect inspired by the Nizam's advent, and, on 27th May, His Majesty's Minister, in reply to an enquiry as to whether the time had not now come to insist on our scheme being taken in hand, stated that, in his opinion, the state of the roads was better than before, and even if it were much worse, he would not willingly press for the inception of our scheme, which would probably entail the temporary occupation of the trade route. Early in September constant robberies on all the trade routes in the south led to a reconsideration of the outlook and, after consultation with the Resident, His Majesty's Minister telegraphed, on the 15th September, his views on the general question; he expressed the belief that only the employ ment of British troops in some form could give any hope of material improve ment, pending the organisation of a gendarmerie, the prospect of which was remote. He put forward for consideration proposals made by the Resident with a view to the improvement of the situation, without actually occupying the roads. These proposals were as follows:— (1) To re-establish the Vice-Consulate at Bam. (2) To increase the mounted escorts at Ispahan, Bushire, Bandar Abbas and Kerman by 100 men, and those at Shiraz and Bam by 200 men. (3) To use these escorts for escorting British caravans that would occa sionally be organised. (4) To warn the Khans along the road that we had been driven to take this step by the continued insecurity and that we hoped that they would co-operate with us, but that, if we met with obstruc tion from them, we should be forced to adopt more comprehen sive measures. His Majesty's Minister considered that the foregoing proposals offered the best hope of early improvement, short of the occupation by our troops of the road, but pointed out that trouble might occur between escorts and the tribes and punitive measures might thereby be necessitated. These proposals met with immediate favour in London, and on September 26th the Secretary of State telegraphed that he was prepared to take any measures which did not involve a military expedition to Persia, and the Government of India were asked to arrange for the necessary men to be held in readiness. The Russian Government on being approached offered no objection to the proposed increase. The situation at Shiraz was meanwhile getting worse, and, on 27th September, His Majesty's Minister suggested that, if the above scheme was favourably considered, the position might be improved by an immediate announcement as to our intentions. The Government of India, on the 30th September, replying to the Secre tary of State, recommended the following distribution of troops:— ( Bushire, 1 squadron. Shiraz area — ] Shiraz, 1 squadron and headquarters. (Ispahan, 1 squadron. C Bandar Abbas, 1 squadron. Bam, area — &lt; Bam, 2 squadrons and headquarters. (. Kerman, 1 squadron. , Jv 22 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF They poihted out the heavy cost and extension of our responsibilities entailed by the proposals, which in certain circumstances might lead to a permanent occupation of the country, which they strongly deprecated. On 22nd October, His Majesty's Minister, consequent upon alarming reports received as to danger to British lives and property in Shiraz advised His Majesty's Government to arrange for the immediate despatch of 300 men, a step which he considered to be warranted by the situation at Shiraz apart from the road question. On the 4th October, the Government of India reported to the Secretary of State that, in the opinion of their military advisers, no risk would attach to the despatch of a cavalry regiment to Shiraz and that orders had been given to collect the supplies and transport required for the journey. At this time the situation in Shiraz began to show some signs of improve ment, and it was suggested by His Majesty's Foreign Office that this being the case the despatch of troops might be suspended. The Resident depre cated delay in their despatch principally in view of the condition of the roads, which was worse than ever, but also in view of the difficulty of sending them to Shiraz and Ispahan later on, owing to the cold. His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz likewise deprecated this suggestion both in view of the state of affairs in the town and on the roads. On the 9th October, the Government'of India pointed out that the troops could not arrive at Shiraz before November 11th, too late to afford early relief to the Consulate, and proposed to defer arrangements for the despatch of troops until a definite decision had been arrived at as regards the employ ment of British troops for the protection of the roads. On the following day. His Majesty's Minister announced to the Persian Government that, owing to possible danger to British lives and property at Shiraz and elsewhere. His Majesty's Government were compelled to strengthen the Consulate Guard at that place and possibly also at Ispahan and Bushire. The Persian Government urged that the appointment of 'Ala-ed-Dowleh, and a reconciliation alleged to have been effected between Kawam and Sowlet, made the despatch of troops unnecessary. His Majesty's Minister in reply ing on this point to the Foreign Office, after explaining the illusory nature of the alleged reconciliation, said that if the despatch of troops depended solely upon the situation at Shiraz, the improvement which had occurred there since the decision to despatch troops had been arrived at, and the further improvement which was to be expected should 'Ala-ed-Dowleh proceed to Fars, would justify our postponing the despatch of troops for a week to see whether 'Ala-ed-Dowleh would proceed to his post or not. His Majesty s Minister was, however, entirely in favour of the prompt despatch of troops if their main object was to escort our caravans. It will be observed from the above that the proposal to locate squadrons at Ispahan and at Bushire, where there was no suggestion of danger to British lives and property, was based on the assumption that they would be used in connection, with the roads, and that the condition of Shiraz was only a secondary consiideration. His Majesty's Foreign Office, however, whilst ordering the despatch of troops, instructed His Majesty's Minister to inform the Persian Government that the Consular escorts would only be used for the protection of British lives and property, and the Consulates, at Bushire, Shiraz and Ispahan, and that if the Persian Government devised an effective scheme for the protection of the trade routes, the troops would not patrol the roads or make expeditions. His Majesty's Minister asked the Persian Government to afford facilities at Bushire for the landing of the troops, and 'Ala-ed-Dowleh consented to telegraph to the various Khans along the road to ensure that no untoward event should occur by their negligence. It was decided to take no action for the present at Bandar Abbas, Bam or Kerman. Two squadrons of the 39th (K. G. O.) Central India Horse, under Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. Douglas, who had held the .position of Military Attache at Tehran from 1902 to 1907, arrived at Bushire on October 27th andPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 23 left for Shiraz on November 2nd, arriving without incident at their destination on the 12th and 13th. An endeavour was made by the Mullahs of Bushire to work up a boycott and opposition to their landing, and the Governor for some time was not very helpful. Eventually he received peremptory orders from Tehran to co-operate, and all opposition then ceased. Effective arrangements for supplies had been made by Mr. H. G. Chick as far as Kazerun and from that point to Shiraz by Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, each officer accompanying the party along the section of the road for which he was responsible. The third and fourth squadrons disembarked on the 11th and one full squadron left for Shiraz on the 16th, accompanied again by Mr. H. G. Chick, Commercial Adviser to the Resident, and by Mr. Worrall as far as Kazerun. The former went the whole way to Shiraz, the Foreign Office haying sanc tioned his deputation with a view to prosecuting commercial enquiries. Ghazanfar-es-Sultaneh, Khan of Borasjun, had been endeavouring for some time to engineer a combination of local interests to oppose the passage of our troops, whose refusal to permit the local road guards to levy rahdari from their caravan had aroused considerable resentment. This was fanned by inflammatory telegrams from Nejef and elsewhere, but fortunately Ghazan- far's schemes did not materialize, and the second party arrived at Shiraz without incident, on November 27th. In the meanwhile no time had been lost in despatching from Shiraz the squadron destined for Ispahan, which left Shiraz on 18th November, accom panied by an additional 100 men, from the Shiraz squadron, who had pro ceeded as far as Abadeh, in order to escort from thence to Shiraz Miss Ross whose vicissitudes have been reported above. Arrangements had beerTmade for supplies along the Shiraz-Ispahan road as far as Yazdikhast with the assistance of the local staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Department (who here as well as on the Bushire-Shiraz road were of the greatest service to the troops), by Lieutenant Wilson who accompanied the squadron to Ispahan, returning eventually to the Gulf via the Bakhtiari road. Miss Ross's escort returned from Abadeh to Shiraz without incident, on the 5th December, and the Ispahan squadron arrived at its destination the same day, though not without encountering robbers, near the Ispahan boundary beyond Yazdikhast, with the result that Rissaldar-Major Ghulam Muhammad was severely wounded in the leg, whilst two robbers were reported also to have received wounds. A. party of 30 men of the 79th Carnatic Infantry, who left Shiraz on the 18th November for Bushire, accompanied as far as Kazerun by Mr. J. C. Smith, Assistant Superintendent, Indo-European Telegraph Department, arrived without mishap, on November 28th; but a caravan, with whom were two Japanese merchants, was attacked and robbed a short distance in front of them between Khaneh Zinian and Dashtarjin. A third and last detachment of 50 men left Bushire for Shiraz, on De cember 19th, with Mr. Acting Consul Attack on Mr, Acting Consul Smart. Smart, who Was re joining Ms post from leave; a large caravan of specie for the Imperial Bank of Persia at Shiraz being permitted, after reference to Foreign Office, to accompany them. A party of the same size simultaneously left Shiraz, in order to join hands at Kazerun, the Bushire party returning to the coast, and the Shiraz party escorting Mr. Smart to his destination. On the 24th December, the k,hiraz detachment was treacherously fired upon on the Kutal-i-Dukhtar Pass and ^ one sowar was killed; this outrage was organised by the Deputy ^Governor ot Kazerun, Muhammad Ali Khan, of the Kashkuli section of the Kashgai, Colonel Douglas at once despatched a second party of 50 men to hold the top of the passes for the return journey to Shiraz. On the 26th December, the party from Shiraz under Major Birdwood left Kazerun in order to join up with Mr. Smart's party which was due to arrive that day from the Bushire direction; they effected ,a junction m due course without mishap, and were returning to Kazerun together when they were treacherously fired on from a caravanserai. Ibis was the signal id a.24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF general attack by about 800 tribesmen, mostly, it would appear, inhabitants of the villages in the Kazerun plain. Two followers were killed and 7 sowars wounded, and a Hospital Assistant and one follower missing, as a result of the fighting which followed, whilst Mr. Smart was also slightly wounded, and, falling off his horse some way off the beaten track, was captured and taken to Muhammad Ali Khan's camp, where he was well treated. For some days his fate remained unknown. The detachment fought their way very creditably into Kazerun, where they were not further molested. Mr. Smart was sent into Kazerun by Muhammad Ali Khan, on December 29th. He afterwards explained to His Majesty's Minister that his capture, was in no way the fault of the escort, but was due solely to the fact that he had not been in his proper place in the middle of the party, but had been riding in the rear. The force finally left Kazerun, on 2nd January, joining up with a detachment under Colonel Douglas which had gone out from Shiraz to Kutal-i-Dukhtar to meet them, and arrived at Shiraz without further mishap, on 5th January, the Kawam doing all he could to facilitate their passage. With the landing of troops at Bushire, and the action taken in Tehran and locally in consequence of the above incident, and with its effect on the general situation, this Report does not deal; a summary of these matters and of the discussions which took place as to the line of action to be adopted in Pars, will be included in the Report for 1912. In view of the stress laid by the Persian Government, on the inception of an effective gendarmerie scheme, it Gendarmerie schemes m Fars. i • i i x JU'-fl 4.1, seems desirable to record bneny tne measure of progress effected in this direction during the year. General Maletta, an elderly Italian General who had for the past 15 or 20 years been in the service of the Persian Government, arrived after long delay in Shiraz on March 24th charged with the organisation of a gendar merie suited to the needs of Fars ' et conformement aux exigences de la reforms moderne.' He found three officers and 37 men between Aminabad on tlie Northern Frontier of the Province and Shiraz, and one officer with six men in the town itself, all alike clamouring for long arrears of pay. He found no trace of the weapons said to be awaiting his arrival at Shiraz, nor of the 80,000 Tomans which the Persian Government had solemnly assured His Majesty's Minister had been sent to Shiraz. Without arms and money he could do nothing, and it was soon clear that the Nizam was in no way anxious to see General Maletta's scheme take shape; he no doubt hoped, however, to use him in order to obtain control, directly or indirectly, of the promised 80,000 Tomans. It should be added that General Maletta's scheme was considered by all concerned to be quite inadequate to secure the safety of the road. Up to the end of the year' the General remained quietly at Shiraz, unprovided with funds, and apparently forgotten by the Central Government, who ignored all his communications, until October, when, momentarily galvanised by the British note, they demanded from him a further ' project' oblivious of the scheme which he had submitted only six months before, and which had received approval after meticulous consideration by the Minister for War. On 5th September, His Majesty's Minister telegraphed (with reference to a proposal then under consideration to employ Swedish officers to organise a treasury gendarmerie with the assistance of Major Stokes, for use, amongst other places, on the roads in Fars) that the appointment of the latter was doubtful, and that without him there was little prospect of any effective work being obtained from a gendarmerie. The Persian Government in reply to the British note announcing our intention to increase the Consular Guard at Shiraz and elsewhere, laid the greatest stress upon the appointment of Swedish officers, but though the officers destined for Fars arrived in Tehran in December, up to the end of the year they had not left the Capital, nor had the Persian Government made any attempt to fulfil its promise to us to cause gendarmes to be enlisted in, IBhiraz in anticipation of the arrival of the officers.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 25 Russian. —Four Russian steamers of the Eussian Steamship Company arrived from Odessa during 1911, on Foreign Interests . March 18th, May 11th, September 18th and November 17th. The total number of packages landed was 2,819, of which 1,900 were oil, 321 earthenware, 144 glass, 138 sugar, 80 flour and 49 macaroni. Exports to Russia consisted principally of 16 tons of Gum Tragacanth. Persian Tambaku ' for Turkey, for which the Russian Company act as Agents, was also forwarded by the line. Early in 1911, two brothers Konoff arrived to represent the Company at Bushire, and showed themselves keener on business than their predecessors. Samples of articles were sent from Bushire to Odessa. In May the elder brother M. Konoff returned temporarily to Odessa with the firm's broker, a Persian named Muhammad Husain, but came back to Bushire in November. Early in December, a portion of the Bushire population were stimulated to resentment on account of Russian action at Tabriz in the north of Persia. A boycott of Russian goods was engineered and Russian crockery broken m the bazaar; while the Mullahs forbade lighters to go out to the Tigre, on December 6th. On April 1st, Monsieur Kadloubousky handed over charge of the Con sulate-General to Monsieur Dmitrieff who had been previously Russian representative at Jeddah. M. Konoff, the elder, acted as his Secretary. Difficulties arose on the new incumbent's arrival in connection with the purchase of a house and grounds by M. Kadloubousky from an Armenian, now in England, for a new Russian Consulate-General; his successor dis approving of the bargain, which has apparently been set aside. German. —During the year, 12 vessels belonging to the Hamburg- Amerika line called at Bushire on the outward voyage, and landed about 4,506 packages from Hamburg, and 29,023 packages from Ahwaz, a tota of 33,529. The S. S. ' Bielefeld ' of the German-Australian line also called in ballast on her way to Basrah to take a cargo of dates to Australia. This was the second year that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. and their friends had despatched dates by German vessels to Australia; but, m 1911, the Bntisn India Steam Navigation Company entered into competition by sending a vessel from Basrah to Australia. Ten vessels called on the homeward voyage, and two British steamers, the S. S. ' Corinth ' and ' Ivydene,' were also chartered by Messrs. Wonck haus &amp; Co. to carry grain to Hamburg and London. The total^ quantity ot grain exported from Bushire by Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. during the year was about 4,973 tons wheat and 3,795 tons barley. These figures show an important expansion of export trade to Germany, though imports remain on the same level as in 1910 ; In imports, a large business in sugar, Belgian from Antwerp more particularly, is being bui up, and the failure of British refiners to put the required kinds and shapes of sugar on the Persian market in the first place, and of the British shipping lines to call at Antwerp in the second place, makes it difficult to prevent import of sugar from becoming a German monopoly. Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., profiting by the higher limit of purchase provided by the special shipping rebates given by the . H amb urg-Ainerika line, outbid all British firms buying gram at Bushire, and drove looal British competition off the field. Their increased activity and extension of business was made possible, not so much by the good harvestofmO-llas bylarge credits being opened in their favour at Basrah £30 000 by ^ Deutsche Bank, £30,000 by the Deutsche Orient Bank the Dresdner Bank and Ferdi nand Jacobsen, £10,000 by Martin's Bank of London, all in January an £40,000 by German Banks in February This new banking is undoubt^ily the result of the new formation of the Wonckhaus firm with M Otto Beit as a sleeping partner and Mr. Thomas Brown (a British subject) directing operations in the Gulf.26 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF In September, the firm rented large additional premises in a good situa tion fronting the creek, from the heirs of the late Haji Muhammad Sheffi. They also renewed, for a period of three years, their lease of the property of the Residency Dragoman at a higher rental, but the well-situated wharfage space in front of the building, lying next to the Customs premises, was this time excluded by the owners from the agreement. Several other warehouses facing the creek were rented, and a very large staff employed in buying and cleaning grain. At the end of the year the German firm announced that they had made very large profits from their Gulf business during 1911, the sum of £50,000 being mentioned (though probably greatly exaggerated); substantial bonuses were distributed to all Persian employes at Bushire, wheat brokers, cleaners, fete. In conversation, Herr Eisenhut has said that 1911 was an excellent year for them, coming after three bad years. The freight rebates by the subsidised line must have largely contributed to this. In January and February the firm were still being hampered at Bushire with the situation created by their shady Persian employes, Haji Muhammad Hasan and Mirza Husain, ex-Munshi of the German Consulate. The former had fled to Tangistan to escape debts to German and British firms, and a charge of having made away with a sum in coin shipped in native craft for the purpose of buying grain; he was eventually induced to return, however, by Herr Krumpeter, apparently on a promise of being whitewashed. By thus dropping the charge of misappropriation and ' finding ' that the money bags had fallen overboard, the firm were able to recover the value from the Insurance Company, and at the same time to save themselves from parting with a valuable henchman. Haji Muhammad on his return apparently exposed ex-Munshi Mirza Husain, for a few days afterwards Herr Krum peter proceeded to force an entry into the latter's house for the purpose of seizing certain documents, and was somewhat roughly handled by Mirza Husain's adherents. Mirza Husain himself took sanctuary with a local Mullah, and claims against him concerning his dealings in arms were subse quently lodged by the German firm. The firm was represented at Bushire from February to the end of the year by Herr Eisenhut, who succeeded Herr Krumpeter, who went on leave. In August Herr Sandri from Bahrain arrived to assist Herr Eisenhut. An incident occurred, in September, over a coolie, who had taken ad vances from both British and German Shipping Companies in the course of which a Farrash of the Residency laid hands on the coolie on the open wharf in front of the German firm's office. The German Consul took up a very blustering attitude vis-a-vis the Residency, claiming violation of domicile and demanding condign punish ment of the Farrash, on the ground that the wharf was included in the Ger man firm's lease from the Residency Dragoman. On the contrary being proved, he resorted to the argument that in the scuffle the Farrash and coolie had even touched the walls of the German office. The Farrash concerned was unfortunately murdered a few days later by a private acquaintance who picked a quarrel with him, and correspondence with the German Consulate thus came to an end.

With Chahkutah and its surrounding villages is now included Ahmedi, which was formerly a separate entity owned by the family, of which the Telegraph ghulams, Mullah Abdullah and Agha Muhammad Quli, are now the representatives, Agha Mustapha Bahmiar of Chogadak and Tul-i- Siah being a near relation. Shaikh Hussein of Chahkutah ejected them many years ago, but has had a hard struggle to retain' Ahmedi the importance of which arises from its position as the first stage on the caravan route. Tul-i- Siah and Chogadak occupy a vague position: Shaikh Hussein Khan of Chah kutah considers himself the suzerain, but Agha Haidar, the Zabit of Chogadak, and his brothers pay revenue independently to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and similarly collect road exactions at Chogadak. Agha Haidar has, however, always assisted Shaikh Hussein in his quarrels, and looks to him for support. The Zabit of Tul-i-Siah also claims the villages of Ali Changi and Gurak on the borders of Tangistan, but these are now managed by the ruler of Tangistan, The boundaries of Chahkutah and Chogadak are on the— North-West : Between Husseinaki and Hassandun in Angali, North : Between Husseinaki and Isawand in Borazjun, between Isawand in Borazjun and Ab-i-Tawil : between Tul-Ashki and Bulferiz in Tangistan. East : Between Chahkutah and Samal in Tangistan. South : Chahkutah and Chah-i-Pir in Tangistan ; between Chogadak and Buneh-Giz and Gurak in Tangistan. West : The district extends into the Mashilleh between Chogadak and the mainland of Bushire. The following villages may be considered as part of the district ; — Chahkutah. Tul-Ashki. Ahmedj. Konarabadi. Husseinaki, Chogadak. P^waireh. Tul -ri -Siah. Ab-i'-Tawil. The maliyat pf Chahkutah is 1,500, of Ahmedi 700 tomans : that of Chogadak and f ul-i-Siah 75° : the Khan's revenue is derived from taxation of cultivated land, and also from rahdari and alafi from caravans passing Ahmedi. Chahkutah and the nearest villages have been for generations in this family, which boasts Arab descent. The present ruler, Shaikh Hussein, has been constantly at war during the past few years. His brothers Shaikh Ali, Mohammed and Abdullah united to force him to share their father's villages with them : and they were for years in sanctuary in Borazjun and Angali. Sheikh Ali was killed in a quarrel by Shaikh Hussein in 1911: Sheikhs Mohammed and Abdullah raised a revolt in 1911 and were joined by Zair Khidar of Tangistan and Ahmed Khan of Angali. During some sharp fighting the elder brother was killed and Shaikh Abdullah, wounded, took ' bast ' in the town Residency with about 80 of the Zangineh tribe, inhabitants of Chahkutah. Later they went back, and Shaikh Abdullah was given the village of Ab-i^Tawil by Shaikh Hussein ; but blood-feud and enmity still prevails between the brothers. Shaikh Hussein was for many years a close ally of Darya Begi, and introduced Zair Khidar, then an unimportant Kedkhuda of Tangistan, to his favour. In 1909 Darya Begi accompanied Shaikh Hussein in an expedition against Zair Khidar and again in 19'o, but then the Governor of the Gulf Ports made friendship with the Tangistani chief and authorised him to attack Shaikh Hussein in support of the latter's brothers. Much fighting ensued, but Nizam-us- Sultaneh on his way to Shiraz took up the cudgels for Shaikh Hussein, sent ^ashgais under Amir-ul-Mulk to assist Shaikh Hussein, and the Tangistanis and2 Angalls were beaten off. Shaikh Hussein manifested his enmity against Darya Begi by threatening to capture him in Bushire, in consequence of which Darya Begi after his dismissal took bast ' with the Residency. Muwaqqer-ud- Douleh, when appointed Governor, at first supported Shaikh Hussein, then turned against him and favoured Zair Khidar. Shaikh Hussein was openly defiant to the Governor as long as Nizam-us-Sultaneh was in power, and since then has been invoking the Residency's support to prevent the Governor from taking his revenge. In 1911 he contracted with Nizam-us-Sultaneh to be answerable for the revenue of Ahram, Khawiz and Tangistan for the sum of 46,000 tomans for a period of 6 years by arrangement with the Tangistani Khans, proteges of Nizam-us-Sultaneh. In October 1911 these were however turned out of Tangistan by an uprising on the part of Zair Khidar, who besieged some of the Khans with one of Shaikh Hussein's sons and men in the fort of Qalat. The outstanding feature of Chahkutah politics is blood enmity with Angali on the one hand, and Zair Khidar of Tangistan on the other, and insubordina tion as regards the present Governor of Bushire. Possession of Ahmedi, which has often been threatened, is the most important factor for the Shaikh, because of the large revenue derived from exactions from muleteers. He is also desirous of obtaining a hold on the northern part of Tangistan. He always professes very friendly feelings towards the Residency, but is a great arms-dealer and importer, like most headmen in a position to participate in the traffic. The ruling family are :— Shaikh Ahmed Shaikh Hussein (about 50) I . Shaikh All (a ed 35) (killed 1910) Shaikh Mohammed (aged 28) (killed 1911) Shaikh Abdullah (aged 23) Shaikh Mohammed Shaikh Ghulam Shaikh Nassir Shaikh Abdur (aged 24) Hussein (aged 18) Rasoul (resides at Ahtnedi) I I Shaikh Khaz'al Shaikh Miz'al Chog^dak and TuM-Siah had till 1912 been ruled by Agha Mustapha Bahmiyar. Agha Mustapha Bahmiyar (died 1912) I Agha Haidar (about 42) Agha Shahriyar. i Agha Bahmiyar I Agha Ghulam Hussein Agha Bahmiyar (about 24) Hussein Khan Agha Haidar lives at Chogadak with the younger Bahmiyar and Hussein Khan, his half-brothers. Agha Ghulam Hussein and the elder Bahmiyar live at Tul-i-Siah. 360 tomans are remitted from the revenue annually on condition of the provision for guarding the route. Borazjun, This district forms part of Dashtistan, and is part of the province of Pars. The district is bounded on the :— North-. by the river Rudhilla from Haft Jush, where it meets Angal territory, to Durudgah, and thenceby the Daliki or Shur river to some few miles past Buneh Mirza; with Dalika is about 3 miles past Qaraoul Khan at a sulphur stream crossing the caravan road, and this boundary line then mounts to the summit of the hills.♦ # 3 East: boundary is along the summit of the Gisakun range past Kuh-i- Bagh-i-Taj. South : boundary crosses the entrance to the Haft Mulla ravine, south of Nanizak and Jamileh: between Sarkurreh and Samal and Gulan- gun in Tangistan: then north of Bulferiz and Gandumriz in Tangistan: north of Ab-i-Tawil in Chahkutah and south of Isawand. West: boundary is north-east from Isawand, Nokal being in Angali and Jarrrafi in Borazjun, to Haft Jush. The capital, Borazjun, contains perhaps 800 houses and 4,000 inhabit ants, and has a fine caravanserai. The district is entirely agricul* tural^ a quantity of tobacco being produced besides grain. The maliyat of Borazjun is 5,300 tomans : the revenue of the Khan is said to be some 16,000 tomans by taxation of land under cultivation, and 20,000 tomans from rahdari, alafi and the taxation of caravans, besides sale of mono polies of gum, etc. Ziaret used many years ago to.be a separate entity in the hands of the ' Begs', so called; but one oi the family of the Khan of Borazjun now resides there. The following villages are in Borazjun district Borazjun Ziaret. Bunderuz Banar. Sar Kurreh Jaitn. Dar-i-Chatu Jerrafi. Isawand (along caravan route) Saifabad, Chah-i-Khani (near caravan route) Kullul. Chah-i-Arabi 4 Kharagah. Khushab (along caravan route) Ma^adabad. Khushmakun Borgahi Giz-i-Bid Bunneh. Deh-i-Nao Rahdar (along caravan route.) Bagh Hissar (along caravan route). Qaraoul Khane. (In the Gisakun mountains)-— Khurmi Kakun Jamileh. Lardeh Nakhi Bagh-i*Chenar, There are paths, practicable for lightly laden animals up the Gisakun range (i) by Lardeh, (ii) by Khurmi to the foot of the Kuh-i-Bagh Taj, whence the track is too difficult for animals. The Bagh i Taj crest is known by several names: from east to west Kamar-i-Zardak, Kamar-i-Sheinahu, Kamar-i-Dubareh, Kamar- i-Bardisar The two last paths to the top of the crest are Rah-i-Kerdak, and Rah or Puk-i-Bariki. The ruling family of the Khans are descended from a certain Mulla Mohammed, who came from the district of Kam Firuz, became a servant of the then dynasty, married the Khan's daughter and became chief in Borazjun. (iV.Z?.—Genealogy on next page.)Ghazanfer -us -Sultaneh some years ago took over the government from his ao-ed father He and his father have acquired great wealth from blackmail on the caravans passing through Borazjun, especially from monopolies of the sale of srain to ammals. He had to take to the Gisakun mountains when Ijlal-ud- Douleh the Wazir of Pars, attacked the chief of Dashtistan but returned later. e is married to a daughter of Ismail Khan of Shahancara hut the bitterest blood- feud reigns between him and this Khan on account of the district of Zira, which formerTf was farmed by one of the Khans of Borazjun, but has for years been let by Nizam-us-Sultaneh to the Khan of Shabancara. Ghazanfer us. SuUaneh his repeatedly tried to have his father-in-law evicted and himself given the lease. Constant bloodshed goes on between Shabancara, Zira and Borazjun on these accounts, and raids are common A further cause of host'hty was^ h.s seizure and imprisonmeirt in the autumn of 1911 of his cousin Mirza All Rha and the latter's sons on a charge of conspiracy : Mirza Ah Khan s sister being wife of Ismail Khan of Shabancara. Ghazanfer-us-Sultaneh has been noted for his oppression of caravans: and for his hostility to the British in 1909 and again in 1911, wh f e ' stirring up agitation both before and after the passage of the Central Ind a Horse Outwardly fair spoken, he is a difficult man with whom to deal : he is the most noted buyer of and dealer in smuggled arms and ammunition among the headmen of the Bushire littoral and hinterland. Hayat Daoud and Rudhilleh. The district of Rudhilleh was until some 15 years ago entirely separate fmm Havat Daoud and then belonged to a certain Mohammed Khan , its present Connection occurs from the fact that its resident Khans since then have been members of the Hayat Daoud family, who defeated and drove out the last owners. The present chief of Hayat DaoUd lived during his fathers We-time for some years at Mohmedi in charge of the district: after his succession the third brother Hussein Quli Khan, took over charge. As the family s interests are much bound up, and all pay allegiance to the eldest brother at Bandar Rig, the districts are taken together. Hayat Daoud is about 33 miles long by 37 wide. It is bounded on the— West: by the sea from the Kuh-i-Bang hills as far as the outflow of the Sur-i-Bidu to the sea ; Snuth • bv the Sur-i-Bidu. to its rise in the Mohur-i-Hayat Daoud behind Chaharrustai, separating Hayat Daoud first from the Rudhilleh district, afterwards from Shabancara ; East ■ Hayat Daoud territory extends 15 miles into the mountains from the coast range, and marches with Kashkuh tribal country: but it has no villages in the hills, which are only used lor pasture ; North from the middle of the Kuh-i-Bang hills, north of the village of Bang, across the narrow valley to their east, and north of the village of Shul to the coast range, then across the mountains tor some 15 miles. In the political territory of Hayat Daoud are also (i) the port f d v^ge of Bunder Dilam with about 1 mile square each side of it, and (n) the islands o Kharg and Khargu, about 25 miles from the mainland off Kudhilleh. The geographical district of Rudhilleh is some 21 miles long from near Shief to Bidu, and 19 miles wide from the sea to near Kureband. It is bounded on the— West : by the sea from the outflow of the Shur-i-Bidu to some 5 miles north-west of Shief, which is in Angali. North : by the Shuri-i-Bidu. East • it is separated from the district o( Shabancara by a line running north from the Rudhilleh river between the villages of Manun m6 Rudhllleh and Mukaberrin Shabancara as far as the Sur of Bidun near Anjiru : south of the Rudhilleh river the boundary with Angali is betwhen Kurraband and Zerdaki in Angali, and then runs south to within a few miles of Shief. In 1904, during the Governorship of the Gulf Ports by the present Nizam-us-Sultaneh, the introduction of Customs posts along the ports of the district led to difficulties with the Khans, who had previously managed their own Customs. This difficulty was settled by the Khans agreeing to the establish ment of a Customs post at Bandar Rig, and at Bandar Dilam, and the levy of. duties under the new Tariff : but in return for the remission of nearly all the maliyat (revenue) at which the districts were assessed. The balance still paid amounts to J 8,000 tomans for Hayat Daod ; 4,020 toir^ns for Rudhilleh. Recently in 1910 an arrangement was come to between the Provincial Customs and the Khans by which the latter agreed to the establishment of a post near the mouth of the Rudhilleh river, and the Customs to pay the Khans 1.000 tomans per annum : one-third of this goes to the son of the chief Khan of Bandar Rig, one-third to the son of Mohammed Khan, the brother who resides at Chaharrustai, one-third to the son of Hussein Quli Khan at Rudhilleh. A Customs post has also been opened at Genaweh, a small port between Bandar Rig and Kuh-i-Bang. The revenue of the Khans is drawn from taxation of land under cultivation, and from tithes of all produce exported from the districts, also from date gardens and other sources. One of the most important villages is Shul, between the Kuh-i-Bang mountains and the coast range, and on the borders of Lirawi. The ruling family would appear to be a branch of that ruling in the time of Mir Mohanna, the pirate, in 1760, when Bandar Rig was a more influential port than Bushire : but their rise and extension of power dates only from the past two generations. Khan Ali Khan, who died about 15 years ago, was continually in trouble with the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and in consequence of his turbulence and arrears his two eldest sons Haidar Khan and Mohammed Khan were, in their boyhood, brought up in Bushire, as hostages for their father's conduct. Khan Ali Khan was constantly fighting, and generally victorious over, Haji Hassan Khan of Lirawi, the district immediately north of Kuh-i-Bang. After his death his sons divided their spheres of influence as follows :— Haidar Khan took Bandar Rig. Hussein Quli Khan took the district of Rudhilleh. Mohammed Khan took Chaharrustai and acts as commander of the forces of the district. Further, after the death of Murad Khan, brother of Khan Ali, the ports of Bandar Dilam and Genaweh were by family arrangement entrusted to his son, Hussein Khan, and the latter's sons. The strength of the district and Khans lies however in the unity of control, for all are obedient to the eldest brother, Haidar Khan, whose word is law in the district, and outside also. Their wealth, and successful business in smuggling has perhaps added to their power in former years. Moreover by his ^ sister's marriage to Agha Khan, the third son of Haji Hassan Khan of Lirawi, and other marriage ties, besides the lessons of several defeats, Haidar Khan has acquired a ruling voice in the policy of the Khans of Lirawi, and their district. Lirawi today is practically part and parcel with Hayat Daoud. Haidar Khan, who is not a fighting Khan, wields great influence by his sagacity and powerful position over the Khans of Shabancara and Angali as well, while he enjoys cordial relations with the Kashkuli Khans, his neighbours across the mountains. 07 The Khans for man y y ears h ave been almost independent of the Central and Provincial Governments: the Governor of the Gulf Ports never meddles with the districts, nor sends soldiers or officials there, and it would be bevond hl . s P° w . e r f ^ Py ese nt time to dismiss or change the Khans. Their relations with British omcials and traders have been very friendly for some years. The districts of Hayat Daoud and Rudhilleh have for many years enioved the greatest tranquillity : in the greater part of the district a rifle cannot be fired without the consent of the Khan. Their tufangchis must however exceed i ooo in number. , The principal villages are— Of Hayat Daoud {about 26 in ah). Rudhilleh {about /j). Bandar Rig. # Cham Shahab, Mohmedi. Genaweh. Chah-i-Bardi.

The district of Shabancara is bounded on the— North : by the Machur (low hills) of Shabancara, running more or less north-west south-east. East : by the river Shahpur, or Shirin (from where the Mahur descend towards the river north of Sa'adabad in Zira) down to its junction with the Shur or Daliki river at Durudgah. South : by the combined river from Darudgah between the villages of Muka- beri and Mainun in Rudhilleh. North-west : by the river between the villages mentioned up to the Shur-i- Bidu at Anjiru. West : from the Shur (or salt stream, later known as the Shur-i-Bidu) flowing from the Mahur-i-Shabancara : then between Khalifeh and Chaharrustai in Hayat Daoud about i mile from the latter place, and past Anjiru. Zira is bounded on the— West : by the Shahpur river. East : by the Daliki river. North : boundary is south of Siah Mansur and of Mazarai up to the foot of the mountains. On the east the district also marches with that of Daliki from between Beh- bera and the Daliki date-groves, west of the river, down to the south-west of Sarkeverdun in Daliki territory. The Shabancara district contains some 33 villages : Zira about 12. Shabancara, Zira, Deh Kuhne (the capital=about 250 houses, largest). Sa'adabad. Khalifeh (about 100 houses, next largest). Jutta. Saifabad. Tul-i-Sirku. Bunari. Tul-i-Qatil. Dashti. Durudgali. Cham-i-Tangu. Nazar Agha. Basri. Tul Alesfi. Mukaberi. Tul-i-Khargai, Anjiru. Sar-i-Qanat, Boiri. Darvei. Dehdarun. Muhammed Jemali. Band. Tayyibi. Sikanderabad, Chehil Gazi. Chahdul. Chahmushki. Seh Konari. Bahramabad. Zakaryai.IO Shabancara, which is part of Dashtistan, is assessed for the maiiyat at 5,000 tomans. Ziza is the personal property of Nizam-us-Sultaneh and has been leased by him to Ismail Khan of Shabancara for the past 15 years for 11,000 tomans annually. Shabancara is purely an agricultural district, but is noted for horse breeding. The wealth of Zira lies in its date-gardens, which are very extensive. The districts are divided up into spheres amongst the members of the ruling family, which has been in Shabancara for some 18 generations, it is said. Ismail Khan himself resides in, and controls Zira. His elder son Muhammed AH Khan acts as his father's deputy at Deh Kuhne and manages the western part. Rus- tam Khan, a brother of .Ismail Khan, looks after the part from Boiri north and south : Agha Khan, son of the deceased brocher of Ismail Khan, resides at Darvei and rules over the southern part of Shabancara. The Shabancara and Zira districts are said to be able to muster 1,500 tufangchis. The small but rich district of Behbera, consisting of two villages only, has also been assimilated to Zira in recent years by Ismail Khan, In 1909 there was a quarrel between the Kashkulis and Ismail Khan over the rich district of Mazarai, lying in the coast plain north of Zira and across the Shahpur river, which in former times formed part of the sub-government of Khisht. After a raid by the Kashkulis right across Shabancara the question was settled by arbitration of Hayat Daoud, the revenue being paid to the Kashkuli Khans each year, while the control of the district is lefc to one of the Shaban cara Khans, viz., Agha Khan, who sent his brother as his deputy, Mazarai numbers in its villages— Mazarai. Siah Mansur. Dasht-i-Gur. Palangi, Shuli. * Kun-i-Surkh. The chief political feature is enmity and blood-feud with Borazjun and Daliki on account of Zira : relations with Hayat Daoud are very cordial. The ruling family is : — Ismail Khan (about 60) Rostam Khan Mohamed AH Khan (about (32) Sohrab Khan (about 8). Haji Abdullah Khan. Luft Ali Khan. Daughter marked to Khan of Borazjun. Daliki. Agha Khan (about 3&amp;) Shir Khan. This small district, containing 3 villages only, is bounded on the— East : by the mountains. South-, by the Borazjun frontier passing about 3 miles north of Qaraoul Khane. Wed : boundary lies along the Zira border to the west of a narrow strip containing the large date plantations of Sarkeverdun and continues about f mile to the west of the Shur river till it reaches the moun- tains behind Behbera and Mazarai. North : by the bridge of Daliki: there is nothing but mountains each side of this.11 Daliki is the property of Nizam-us-Sultaneh, the Khan paying some 8,200 tomans each year to Nizam-us-Sultaneh, and 500 tomans to Mughis-ud- Douleh, his ' peshkar Its revenue consists of about 8,000 tomans from the date gardens, and many thousand tomans from taxation of caravans, and the monopoly of the sale of grain to them. The villages of Daliki district are;— Daliki (with about 400 houses), Sarkeverdun (west of the river), Qaleh-i-Sefid. Muhammed Reza Beg, grandfather of the present Khan, was killed in 1856 at the gate of Bushire: he originally was Kedkhuda of Ziaret in Borazjun. Habibullah Beg, his son, was powerless and the district was taken by the Khans of Borazjun. He was in the service of the Khan for some years, and then transferred to Daliki as Kalantar under the Fars Government. After his death, Muhammed Reza Beg ruled as Kalantar of Daliki, and was killed at Kumarij by Haidar Khan some 11 years age. his wife having been a cousin of Haidar Khan. Nur Muhammed Beg succeeded him, and the district was sold by the Shah to the Nizam-us-Sultaneh. Nur Muhammed was later given the title of Khan. He is on terms of enmity with the Khans of Shaban- cara, and an ally of Ghazanfer-us-Sultaneh of Bci&amp;Zjun. The genealogy of the ruling family is as follows :— Muhammed Reza Beg. Habibullah Beg. r — Muhammed Reaa Beg. Nur Muha-nmed Khan Hussein Beg. (about 40). I 71 Mansar Beg Allah Kerum Beg Fathullah Beg (farms Jamileh in the (about 15). (about 20). mountains). Owing to his close relations, as tenant, with Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Nur Muhammed Khan has succeeded in getting the control of the villages of Dawa- guni and Banaki on the Khisht plain given to him, and his brother Hussein Beg generally resides at Banaki. Thus the Kotal-i Malu pass is wholly under the control of the Daliki Khans, His nephew Mansur Beg farmed from Mushar- us-Douleh in iqii the village of Tamileh, in the mountains up the Daliki river, and district. Extortion of large revenue from caravans is the all-important object of the Khan's policy. He is considered ill-disposed towards the British. Tangistan. Tangistan, as at present composed, includes localities formerly separate entities such as Samal and Ahram, and the Khawiz valley. The last named is the only portion in the mountains, and outside the coast plain: the Tangistani chiefs, its purchasers, have brought it under Tangistan proper. The present boundaries of the district are on the— West: the Mashilleh from near the caravan route to its end, then along the sea-coast to Karri.\ 12 South : from this point to the hills behind (which separate it from inland Dashti) and northwards along the crest of these hills to a gulley flowing out past Kullul, a little to the north : south of Bagh-i-Abui to the mountains north of the Kuh-i-Bairami. North : from the Mashilleh, south^ of the caravan road, south of Chogadak, north of Alichangi, then east of Chahkutah, and north westwards till it meets the Borazjun border : west of Bulfenz and Gandumriz : then turning eastwards north of Gulungun, along a low range of hills till it reaches the Tang-i-Haft Mulla. East : southwards along the rage of coast mountains, past the Kuh-i- Dukhtar to the entrance of the Tang i-Wahush, then along the range to east of the Khawiz valley, south of Mohadu and Ashi. A low range of hills separates the villages on the sea-coast from the rest of Tangistan. The villages of Tangistan are— Sea coast. Inland valley. In the Khawiz valley. In Northern Tangistan. Pakushi.

Ahram, the Khawlz Valley and Samal are properties of Nlzam-us-Sultaneh, (being farmed for about 6,400 tomans in 1911) ; but the grant was made by the Government in Tehran irrespective of the rights of ownership possessed by the Khans of Tangistan themselves in the date gardens of Ahram. The maliyat of the rest of Tangistan is 2,500 tomans. At^ the time of the British War of 1856, when the Tangistanis put up a brief resistance, their district was in the undivided control of Baghir Khan. For much longer, however, they had been notorious for their inroads into Bushire, the outskirts of the town and the island being from time to time raided by them. After Baghir Khan's death the district got gradually out of the control of its own chiefs. For a time the famous Mohammed Khan of Dashti ruled it subsequently Hassan Khan, son of Baghir Khan. Haidar Khan, a nephew of the above, was kept a prisoner at Shiraz for many years previous to 1890 , After his return he and his cousin Ali Khan ruled alternately, but weakly and badly: and several Kedkhudas made themselves practically independent, including a certain Kedkhuda of Baghak, Haji Mohammed AIL Maliyat was not paid, and the Khans, in bad odour with the people, were finally driven out through the Darya Begi's championship of Zair Khidar, son of the above named Kedkhuda of Baghak. This man originally agreed to act as Kalantar of the district under the Khans, and got together the maliyat, and finally dispossessed the Khans. From 1905 onwards, Zair Khidar and the various Kedkhudas remained each supreme in his own village or surroundings, the most notable being Hassan Bakshu in Ambarak, Ghulam Hussein Haji Khidar in Shuraki, Reis Ali in Dilwar. The Khawiz valley and Ahram were farmed by Zair Khidar who amassed money but was very lenient. In 1911 Nizam^us-Sultaneh rejected Zair Khidar's overtures, having with him in his suite some of the younger Tangistani Khans. Zair Khidar was attacked by a force of the Nizam, beaten back to the hills, and his village ? hem shin destroyed. Sharp fighting ensued, in which some of the Kedkhudas hke Hassan Bakshu, took the part of the Khans, Baghir Khan, Bahadur-us- Sultaneh was killed, but old Haidar Khan went back to Ahram with the other Khans on Nizam us-Sultaneh's behalf. They remained in power as long as Nizam was Governor-General, but in October Zair Khidar attacked them in the fort of Qalat, and, as their supporters melted away, they were forced to fly the district. Muwaqqer-ud Douleh, the new Governor, put Zair Khidar in charge of ali Tangistan, and they maintain friendly relations. The other Kedkhudas are by no means subordinate to Zair Khidar, though Zair Khidar can ratse the most men, Reis Ali of Dilwar has become rich, and therefore of some importance, through successful smuggling, &amp; The number of tufangchis in Tangistan is altogether perhaps 1,000, but there are so many blood feuds and enmities that more than 300 would most unlikely be found together. At the time of Seyyid Murteza's introduction of the l angistams into Bushire in 1909, 1,000 men were said to have collected, but the number was really much less, and then they were attracted by the prospect The family of the Khans of Tangistan is— Baghir Khan.

Ahmed Khan. {26). Mohammed AH i Khan. Zair Khidar's residence is at Shamshiri, his fort at Qalat near Ahram.H Kumarij. The principal portion of the Kumarij district consists of a level plain stretching from a little beyond the top of the Kotal-i-Kumarij to the southern end of the Tang i-Tmkan, and measuring some four miles by three miles. But the actual boundaries at present are on the— North : the southern end of the Tang-i-Turkan, South ; the village of Cheroom on the banks of the Shahpur river, beyond the foot of the Kumarij Kotal East: the mountains Kuh-i-Mast and Kuh-i-Gunjishk, which separate the district from the Kazerun plain. West: the river Shahpur at Rudak, which belongs to Kumarij. Only five villages are in the district Kumarij (about 150 houses inhabited). Rudak. Bafiaft. Cheroom. Caravanserai (Deh Kuhne). It formerly was part of the sub-government of Khisht, but is now owned by Mushar-ud-Douleh, to whom the revenue amounting to tomans is paid. Qashgai clans are neighbours to the district on three sides : the Kashkuli and Chahar Bunicheh tribes outside the further extremity of the Tang-i-Turkan and near Bushakun : the Parsimedan about tour miles the further side of the Kuh-i-Mast: the Kashkuli again about seven miles to the west of Rudak. There are two alternative routes between Kazerun, Kumarij and Konar Takhteh. One, the Rah-i-Bardun, over the Kuh-i-Mast, is often used by Khurshid Khan for caravans to Kazerun, when he is at strife with the Kashkulis. The other route from Kazerun leaves the main track at the caravanserai and passes by the Kuh-i-Surkh road to the north of Kumarij till it descends on to the Konar Takhteh plain, thus avoiding the Tang-i-Turkan, Kumarij and the Kotal-i Kumarij altogether. About 1905, in the time of Haidar Khan, its late chief, the district of Kumarij was more important than today: Haidar Khan, by force of arms, obtained unlimited control from the top of the Kotal-i-Malu to Kazerun, where he established himself as Deputy Governor, turned out and defeated Khwajeh Ibrahim, Kalantar of Kazerun. Haidar Khan died of wounds inflicted by a slave at Kazerun in September 1909, leaving an infant son, Farajullah Khan, in the guardianship of a black confidant, Khurshid. The latter possesses considerable talents, and great bravery : he has had to repel attacks by a brother of the late Haidar Khan, and constant aggression from men whom he has outlawed from Kumarij, including the well-known Ah Mohammed. The Kashkulis are bitter enemies of his, and covet the district. In the spring of 1911 Nizam-us-Sultaneh determined to attack Kumarii urged on by Soulet-ud-Douleh: several hundred Qashgais with other partisans of Nizam bombarded the village, and Khurshid, after shutting himself up in the Khan s fort on which many of his own villagers fired, escaped to the Kuh-i-Mast, He was gradually joined by his adherents, and returned in June 1911 to Kumarij. when he destroyed most of the houses in the village to prevent the inhabitants opposing him again. He makes a great show of ruling not in his own right but on behalf of Parajul ah Khan. He is on friendly terms with the Kalantar of Kazerun, Khwajeh Abdullah, Nasir-ud-Diwan, but not very well disposed towards Hussem Beg of Dahki. He pays his own tufangchis (who probably do not number more than 150) well. The outstanding feature of Khurshid's politics is enmity with the Kashgais. The Tang-i-Turkan is a no-man's land, neither yashgais nor Kumanjis venturing beyond their respective ends.•5 :,el Plai, , So «Hien Previous rulers of Kumarij were:— Mulla Mohammed Sbeffi (killed by retainers about 1871 5 wives: had 10 S'&gt;ns). married Mxilla Hassan Quli (given Daliki village and killed there about 1891). Mulla Abbas Quli (killed by retainers about 1895). Son (in exile at Famur). Son (in exi'e at Snahpur,. sepautj Dfoghtfer (married* Khwajeh Abdulla Nasir-ud-Diwan).

B.—Since the above was written, Khurshid Beg has been accidentally killed : and the political future of the district becomes still more uncertain. Kazerun and Shahpur. The Kazerun plain is a Government of the province of Fars, having a Governor appointed by the authorities in Shiraz: Shahpur was in former times a separate district, but its maliyat (taxation) is now payable from Kazerun and it may be taken together with Kazerun. Boundaries ; on the ; — South-West : the Kuh-i-Mast mountain, separating the district from that of Kumarij. North-east : the mountain range separating it from the Nedun valley, North-West : the Chakkun defile, and the Mulla Na'l Shikan pass, separating it from the (Shulistan) Mamasenni district, distant about 22 miles from Kazerun town. South-east : Pul-i-Abgineh and the Mulla Arab pass, distant about 7I miles from Kazerun and separating it from the Famur district. The valley is therefore about 30 miles long by 4 broad. The revenue of Kazerun is chiefly in kind, some 700,000 lbs. of grain being taken by the Diwan. The village of Dawun is farmed to the Parsi bankers Jamshidian. The villages of Kazerun are Round Shahpur are Kazerun (capital: about 12,000 inhabitants: two parts Bushakan. Bala and Pain). Saifabad. Qaleh-i'-Seyyid Nasir. Mulla Arab. Fathabad. Kemunkeshi. Sa'adabad. Deris. Khudabad. Qaleh-i-Seyyid. Sadrabad. Pul-i-Abgineh. Qaleh-i-Hakim Bashi. Shah Khusrou. Tul-i-Guak. Kur-a'-i-Khamseh. Qaleh-i-Tabatabai and Mashtun. others. Kasakun. Balyan. Mehrinjan. Abu Ali. Dawun.i6 The Kazerun plain is extremely fertile: grain, opium, tobaccb and beans are chiefly grown. Towards the Shahpur end are rice swamps, and a large amount of rice is imported to Kazerun from Shulistan and the Mamasenni district. Dawun which is high up on the hillside, some 7 miles from Kazerun, produces large quantities of raisins. Kazerun and Dawun are also noted for the numbers of mules used on transport work, and owned by the inhabitants. The Government of Kazerun has been for the past few years entrusted to Khans of Qashgai clans, or to underlings of the Governor-General and the Ilkhani: these however change constantly, and the permanent order of the town is in the hands of Khwajeh Abdullah, Nasir-ud-Diwan, hereditary Kalantar, brother of the late Khwajeh Ibrahim. Three generations ago this family emi grated from the Khwajeh family of the Haft Lang branch of the Bakhtiaris. He is connected by marriage with the Sardar-i-Nedun. The villages of Shahpur end of the valley are in the hands and control of the Kashkuli Khans, who encamp on the banks above the Shahpur river spring and autumn. Similarly the caravanserai Khwajeh Ibrahim, off the end of the Tang-i-Turkan, is occupied by Kashkuli tribesmen and others. Deris is a large village, with some 100 tufatigchis, ruled by Derodar Rajab. Pul-i-Abgineh is in the independent control of Mohammed Ismail Khan, its Kedkhuda, who is a near relation of the Kedkhuda of Kaluni in the Dasht-i-Barm. The Kura'-i- Khamseh were owned by the Imam Juma of Shiraz, but the Kashkuli and Farsimedan Khans forcibly took possession of them in th^ autumn of ign. G.Ci B. f\,Simla.

De'puty Governors. —Mansur-i-Diwan continued to hold the appoint- T ment up to the 18th April when he was Local officials. relieved by Shaikh Nasir Khan, who proved to be a strong and fairly capable Deputy Governor. He in his turn was relieved by Mirza Mahmud Khan, on the 3rd October, an enlightened man who has travelled in Europe; who was employed in the Imperial Bank of Persia for 17 years, but who is lamentably weak and unable to exercise pro per authority. Mirza Mahmud Khan retained the appointment up to the end of the year. Karguzars. —In January, the Acting Karguzar, Muhammad Hassan, was relieved by Saiyid Husain, Hassam-e-Saadat, who has carried out the duties of Deputy Karguzar for both Bandar Abbas and Lingah throughout the year. Bandar Abbas is his permanent residence, and he has only paid four short visits to Lingah during the year, in January, March, August and October. ^ ^ , Turkish. —Mr. New was in charge of oreign epresen a ives. Turkish interests throughout the year. Monsieur Nabil Zia Bey, Turkish Consul at Bushire, visited Lingah in the summer, staying from the 3rd to the 15th August. Before calling on Mr. New he erected a flagstaff and hoisted the Turkish flag at the house where he was staying. His attitude throughout his stay was most discourteous, and without any reference to Mr. New he enrolled some 400 persons of Persian, Oman, and Trucial Coast origin, as Turkish subjects, 40 of whom were given papers of Turkish nationality, which were forwarded from Bushire by Monsieur Nabil Zia through the post to a Persian friend of his at Lingah, for distribution. Nearly all these papers of Turkish nationality were subsequently re covered from the holders by the Persian Government. Representations of this extraordinary behaviour towards Mr. Vice-Consul New were made to the Porte by His Majesty's Government, with the result that Monsieur Nabil Zia was dismissed from his appointment at Bushire. Mashat and Omdm—Muhammad Tahnun continued as agent of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat throughout the year. Anjuman. —This assembly has died Local Government. altogether, and during the year no meet ings have been held. Meetings.-—The Turkish Consul's visit to Lingah in August, and the subsequent action taken by the ^ Persian Government in confiscating un authorized passports issued by him, created some unrest locally. A certain section formed a kind of indignation society, which, towards the close of the year was assuming more dangerous proportions, and which threatened^ to completely destroy the authority of the Deputy Governor. The following three Persian officials were members of the society and although this was: known to the Deputy Governor, he was quite powerless to check them :— Abdur Reza Khan (Collector of Revenue). Abdur Reza (Chief of the Deputy Governor's tufangchis). Bahman Shah (Persian Postmaster). Through the representations of the Political Resident the last named was transferred. Lecan-es-Sultan acted as Director till 0astomBi the 18th April when he was relieved by Monsieur L. Collette. R47 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF In November, an agreement was concluded by the Customs Administra tion for a renewal of the lease of the present Customs premises, belonging U) Khan Bahadur Agha Beder, for a term of three years, commencing from the 23rd June 1912. Certain renewals and alterations are to be undertaken, which should greatly facilitate the landing and storing of cargo. Smuggling of rifles, coffee, tea, and aniline dyes has continued unchecked, and the Customs launch permanently stationed here for patrol duty has only effected one capture during the year. Two dhows were captured in December at Charak in the act of smuggling a few bags of tea and coffee. They were brought to Lingah, but were subsequently returned to the owners, and the Customs Administration merely demanded the actual duty on the tea and coffee carried by the dhows. Shih Kuh. —Nothing of importance has occurred during the year in the „ Shib Kuh districts, except some petty on i ion o oun ry. bickering between the Abaidli and Hamadi clans, who have been at enmitv for years past. The latter Shaikh was anxious to take his revenge out of the Abaidlis for the treacherous part they played on the occasion of the Varavi invasion into Shib Kuh, in October 1910, but, through the influence of His Majesty's Vice-Consulate, both were prevailed upon to desist. The disposition of the Shaikhs of districts remains the same. Laristan. —The Sowlet-ed-Dowleh was travelling in Laristan, with Khunj as his headquarters, from February to April. He had an engagement with, and defeated, the Galehdari and Varavi Chiefs, after which the former Chief was invited to accept the Governorship of Laristan. Lar. —Saiyid Abdul Husain, a mad Mulla of Lar, arrived there from Shiraz early in the year. He is a dangerous person who organized the nation alist rising in Laristan early in 1909. He has become more eccentric lately and his power has somewhat diminished in consequence. There is much bitter enmity between the people of Lar and Girash, and in November some considerable looting and counter-looting occurred. During the months of June, July, September and October the town and district of Lar was visited by a succession of severe earthquakes. The terror- stricken inhabitants lived outside the town for months; many people were killed and bazaars, houses and water reservoirs were destroyed. Some 400 residents, who deserted the place on account of the earthquake and other oppression, settled permanently at Lingah and Debai, while others are said to have also migrated to districts in the interior. The road to Lar has been very unsafe throughout the year, and news was received of no less than seven caravans 8erv 0 icf tion of Eoads, Telegraphs and PoBtal which were plundered by Bahlui and Nafar robbers on the road between Bastak and Lar. The most serious case of looting and murder occurred in June, when a caravan of 150 donkeys and 30 mules travelling from Lingah to Jahrum was attacked by Nafar robbers north of Bastak, who killed 20 people accompany ing the caravan and wounded 30. Early in the year 9 caravans from Lar and Jahrum with an approximate total of 1,350 loads got safely through to Lingah. No caravans at all arrived from the 24th May to the 8th September and, during the latter part of the year, 9 caravans with approximately 1,300 loads reached Lingah from Lar and Jahrum. ) Many of these caravans returned empty, A weekly post arrives from Lar by runners, but only very few letters are carried, and no instances of the post having been robbed have been reported. The active measures taken by His Majesty's ships in suppressing the Arms Traffic. Arms Traffic on the Mekran Coast has in- creased the popularity of the Shib Kuh' Coast as an outlet. Arms are now apparently taken by sea, and by land, from Maskat to Sohar and Khasab, from where they are transported across thePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 48 Musandim peninsula to the Trucial Coast ports. And it is stated that arms have even lound their way so far up the Arab Coast as Katif and Katr where depots are said to have been established. The total number of rifles i mded in the Lingah district during the year under review, 2 760 is greatly in excess of the 1910 list, wnich amounted to 972 arms, including Mauser pistols. These rifles are chiefly imported by Evazi and Lari merchants, who send boats across to their agents on the Trucial Coast, generally small craft. Lately many people of Lingah have been attracted by the large profits to be made, and small syndicates have been formed for the purpose of running small consignments of arms. There is a ready sale for good arms among the Arab tribes of Laristan, and m Tangistan, but it is feared many of the rifles imported by Laris and Lvazis nnd their way to Yezd, into the hands of Afghans trading with that place. As before, many Afghans have frequently passed through Lingah, generally in couples., but it is noticed that now more of them move north in the direction of Lar, where their market appears to be situated. The Shaikhs of Charak and Mughu are the worst offenders in allowing their subjects to carry on this illicit but profitable trade. They have been vyarned on many occasions by His Majesty's Vice-Consul against implicating taemselves, but, apart from the comfortable increase in revenue they un doubtedly derive, it is feared that any attempt at prevention on their part would mean their unpopularity among the tribes in the interior, and danger to themselves. ^ Altogether 57 slaves sought redress at the Vice-Consulate during the Slaves. y e . ar -. Of these 22 were granted manu- , . . . mission; 30 applications were rejected, and the remaining 5 cases are still pending investigation. British India Steam Navigation Company. —In May the Company British Interests. introduced considerable alterations in X1 . „' T , tlleir Service to the Gulf, which has benefited Lingah. Fast mail steamers now call here weekly from and to India, in addition to the fortnightly subsidiary service. Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. —Mr. D. Hart has remained in charge of the farm throughout the year. Jn the early part of the year the firm's business was satisfactory, but aeclmed in the last half year, owing chiefly to the abnormal rise in the price of sugar. The unsafety of the route to Lar greatly handicaps the firm's busi ness. Claims.—In May, claimants against the bankrupt estate of Gordhandas, a IIiikIu trader formerly residing at Lingah, were paid their jjto xcxtoi shares. Only two claims against the estate still remain unpaid; one claimant cannot be traced? while against the other there is a counter-claim of a British Indian subject, which has not yet been settled. Disputes.-—Ovdr a. petty dispute about some jewelry, two British Indian subjects living at Qais Island were imprisoned for two days by the Shaikh. His Majesty? Vice-Consul visited Qais ajid found there was no cause for Siich high-handed action. A written apology was given and the Shaikh was made to pay a fine of Rs. 100, being the amount expended by the Hindu traders at Qais who sent a special boat to Lingah reporting the incident. Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. —Mr. E. Randall, an Assistant in the firm, Foreign interests. w . as transferred to Basrah in March, i u tt tx Slnce when ti 16 business has been carried on alone by Herr H. Kosenfeld, who has been in charge throughout the year A few years ago Lingah was the headquarters of the firm in the Gulf, and, besides the Manager, two, and sometimes three, European Assistants were employed. It is thought that the amount of trade done by the firm now hardly justifies their existence here. +1, Ootober it was gathered that this firm had obtained a concession from the Persian Government to mine the iron pvrites found at Khamir (east of l^mgah), but there seems to have been no truth in the report. a49 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Hamburg-Amerika Steamship Line. —During the year 12 steamers from Hamburg called at Lingah, bringing altogether 7,646 packages, about one- third less than the total packages imported the previous year Only two steamers called on the homeward voyage. The total cargo shipped was 5,/96 packages, which includes 3,840 bags of pearl shells; the remaining shipments to Europe consisting of wheat, dates, tobacco and asafoetida. Russian Steam Navigation Company,— ships from Odessa called on the outward voyage bringing a total of 828 packages; one being an oil steamer which did not land any cargo here. Four steamers called homewards and a total of 1,173 packages were shipped. The Company's S. S. ' Tigre ' which arrived here on the 8th December was boycotted by order of the Saiyids. His Majesty's Vice-Consul and Assist- Misceiianeous. ^ Resident.—Mv. R. H. New retained charge throughout the year. Resident's visits. —Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., visited Lingah on the 12th March, and again on the 27th March when ne stayed for two days. The Resident again visited Lingah on the 26th September. Admiral's visits. —Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, R.N., K.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., M.V.O., visited Lingah in the flagship H. M. S. 'Highflyer' on the 28th April. Other visitors.—Mx. H. G. Chick, His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Bushire and Commercial Adviser to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited Lingah staying from the 8th to the 21st August. Mr. Van Peursen of the Arabian Mission visited Lingah for a week in June, and the Reverend Doctor S. M. Zwemer, Head of the same Mission, paid a week's visit in September. Navy and Marine. —The total number of visits made by His Majesty's ships during the year was 103. Consulate Guard. —The guard of one non-commissioned officer and nine sepoys of the 117th Mahrattas were relieved by the same number of the 79th Carnatic Infantry, on the 20th April. The guard at Basidu of one non-commissioned officer and six sepoys were relieved at the same time. Both the Lingah and Basidu guards were again relieved on the 6th July and on the 22nd November. Assistant Surgeon W. H. K, Brumby, I.S.M.B., remained in charge of the quarantine arrangements and of the Charitable Dispensary throughout the year. Captain C. B. McConaghy, M.D., I.M.S., Chief Quarantine Officer in the Persian Gulf, visited Lingah on the 24th February on inspection. Plague. —At the end of April plague broke out at Bushire and at Debai, Quarantine quarantine was enforced against all vessels from those ports. The Deputy Governor co-operated with the Quarantine Medical Officer in endeavouring to prevent native passengers from the Trucial Coast landing near the town, and tufangchis were posted from Bostaneh to Birkeh Siflin for this purpose. Special segregation huts were erected at the quarantine camp to accommodate the increased number of passengers arriving from Bushire and the Trucial Coast. Altogether 8 cases of plague were imported from the Trucial Coast by mail steamers and by native craft, all of which were segregated; two deaths occurred and six cases recovered. It was reported that many cases of plague among Lari and Evazi passengers from Debai were imported through Charak and Mughu, and by order of the Sowlet-ul-Mulk these passengers, some hundreds in number, werePOLITICAL RESIDENCY for 1911. 50 arrested on their way up country at Janah and quarantined for 15 days. This timely action prevented the spread of the disease in the interior. Cholera. —The ports of Basrah and Mohanunerah were infected with cholera from August to November, but no cases were imported here from those ports. At the end of November Bahrain and Debai were infected with cholera. Two cases, both of which proved fatal, were imported from the latter place. R. H. NEW, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Liny ah. Lingah ; The 21st March 1912.rl CHAPTER I!I. ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE BANDAR ABBAS VICE CONSULATE FOR THE YEAR 1911. Trade Routes. It is in some ways satisfactory to note that there have been fewer events n meriting notice in the past year at Bandar Abbas than during 1910. Events worthy of notice are usually synonymous with disturbances in the present condition of Persia, since progress there is none, and on the whole the year 1911 has been less eventful locally than 1910. Far removed and isolated from all centres of political activity, events in other parts of Persia re-echo but faintly here, and the inhabitants of the place display but slight interest in anything but local topics. The bulk of the lower classes and about half of the merchants are Sunnis, and there is a large admixture of Arab, Baluchi and Negro blood in every stratum of society, so that both religious and racial ties are very weak. The year opened with a state of chronic disturbances in Shamil, and of robberies of caravans in the passes on the boundaries of Bandar Abbas jurisdic tion. These lasted till the middle of April, when the increasinsr heat put an end to them. Advantage was taken of this to send a considerable amount of merchandise up into the interior, and an unusual number of caravans for the time of year left Bandar Abbas during May and June. The following is the list of robberies of British-owned goods that occurred during the first four months of the year on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman trade route :— January. —The post was robbed at Galoo Anjir in Farsi, and 26 bags of specie, valued at 34,000 Krans, belonging to Hindus were carried off. 16th February. —A caravan was robbed at Baghu, and 35 donkey loads of goods, valued at 8,632 Krans, belonging to Hindus were car ried off. 24th February. —A caravan was robbed at Gudar-i-Surkh on the bound ary between Bandar Abbas and Kerman jurisdiction, and British goods to the value of 5,210 Krans were carried off. 2nd March. —A consignment of opium being sent to Minab was carried off : value 2,625 Krans. 12th March. —A caravan was robbed at Tang-i-Navergoo, also on the boundary between Bandar Abbas and Kerman, and British goods to the value of 54,300 Krans were carried off. 11th April. —A second robbery occurred at Gudar-i-Surkh and goods valued at 2,600 Krans were carried off. After this the trade routes continued fairly safe till the end of August when an incursion of Baharlus took place. His Majesty's Consul was then at Karachi, and owing to various rumours of a threatened attack on the town, [. M. S. Perseus and ' Espiegle ' arrived : the Consular Guard was also temporarily reinforced from Jask. On the return of His Majesty's Consul, however, it was ascertained that the current reports were considerably exag gerated, and that the Baharlus had contented themselves with robbing a caravan and carrying off some herds and crops from villages in the Shamil Qisirict. British goods to the value of 31,561 Krans were stolen on this occasioD. The roads were fairly safe during October .and November, at the end of which month, however, one Ah Mullah Saffee, a pettv chief from Fars, en camped with a, large number of armed followers in Shamil. Merchants inADMN. REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 5 consequence stopped sending consignments to Kerman, and one caravan wnich did leave was ruboed, Britisn goods to tiie value of 10,969 Krans being carried 0 ~ j w 1 hlcil 2,141 Kr ^ ns worth was subsequently recovered. It will be ob served that the state of the roads was considerably more satisfactory during the last three months of the year than during the first three. This circum stance, however, was purely fortuitous, and was in no way due to any attempt on the part of the Persian authorities to guard the road. A fair number of Europeans travelled up and down the road during the year, including ladies and children, and none of them were molested. The district of Minab is situated some 40 miles, to the- eastward of Minab. Bandar Abbas, at the foot of a lofty , . , , . 1 , range of hills of which it receives the drainage, and this supplemented with wells gives it an ample water-supply, especiaLy after good winter rains. Dykes have been constructed in places by the villagers to store water which is subsequently distributed over the date proves. Dates and henna form the chief products of the district, though a little wheat and barley is also grown : the henna is exported to India and some dates, but none of the latter has as yet been put on the European market: some samples were, however, despatched to London this autumn, and if they are approved of the^re it is probable that regular consignments will be made in In point of climate Minab compares very favourably with Bandar Abbas, as ' Kalah,' the most important village and' seat of the local Governor, is situated some 12 or 14 miles from the sea, and is consequently much dryer than any place situated on the shore. There are some 20 or 25 Hindus estab lished there who export dates, henna, wool, ghi, and of course do an extensive money-lending business, the bulk of the local population being financed by them at very high rates of interest. There are also two or three families of K.soja British subjects there, who own considerable property and export to During the first four months of the year a rapid succession of nominees of the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas, each more incompetent than the last, were appointed as Sub-Governors at Minab: in May, however, one Kerbelai' Muhammad Hassan was appointed to that post, and remained there till December when he left, on account of bad health. His tenure of the appoint ment was a marked contrast to that of his predecessors : no disturbances occurred and, owing in a large measure to his energy and tact, large amounts due to British subiects were recovered. It was mentioned in last year's report that the principal debtor was one Ali Khan: he died in the spring, a fact which considerably facilitated the collection of claims against him and his brothers. About 7,000 tomans were recovered during the summer, from his brothers and heirs, and many minor claims of long standing against other persons were satisfactorily settled. When the year opened Mullah Abdul Rahman, Misbah-i-Diwan, was Local Government. Deputy Governor, and continued to occupy the post till May when he pro ceeded to Busbire to present ' pish-kash ' to the newly appointed Governor of the Gulf Ports. T : he latter discovering that the Misbah-i-Diwan had irregularly amassed a considerable sum here had him arrested by the Rais-i- Nazmieh at Bushire and imprisoned, the Rais-i-Nazmieh being sent here in his place. The latter was a young Tehrani, by name Itizad-i-Hazrat: although considerably better educated and more enlightened than his prede cessor, he was totally devoid of energy or authority. Complaints having been made against him on various errounds to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, the latter agreed to dismiss him, but expressed considerable difficulty in finding a successor : finally, in December, the Misbah-i-Diwan was released, and re appointed to Bandar Abbas. He arrived late at night, on the 26th December, by Customs launch from Lingah and somewhat dramatically in turn arrested and imprisoned the Itizad-i-Hazrat. The Misbah-i-Diwan, though extremely Corrupt, has a certain amount of authority in the town and immediate neigh bourhood : he is on the whole liked bv the local merchants, and he has no nationalist or anti-foreign sentiments : in fact he is usually very bitter against the Persian Government who he says do not recognise the valuable services he has tendered them.53 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF M deGraeve was Director ol Customs till 1st May when he made over charge to M. Four man and proceeded to Cu8tom8 ' Europe. Towards the end of his time here several incidents occurred in which M. deGraeve displayed a somewhat meticulous strictness in his interpretation of the Customs Eeglement: repre sentations having been made on the subject, he was, on return from leave, posted to Northern Persia. M. Fourman wa^ an official of a very dillerent type : although quite new to the country he was most reasonable m every way, and at the same time was held in wholesome respect by his Persian subordi nates. Unfortunately he was transferred in July to Ahwaz, and was suc ceeded by M. Zwinne who has remained in charge up to the end ot the year. He also is an excellent type of official in some respects, and most reasonable m all Customs matters. The only cause of complaint regarding him is'that he only attends the Custom House about two or three times a week, alleging as a reason that he cannot deal with his heavy correspondence there owing to con stant interruptions. The result is that a great deal is left to his subordinates, who transact business in a very haphazard fashion. The constant changes of Directors here is a somewhat unsatisfactory feature of the Customs adminis tration : there have been no less than six changes since the beginning of 1910. M. Zwinne was also threatened with a transfer to Bushire in December, and it was only by energetic protests on his part to Tehran that he has so far managed to avoid it. Nor are these changes desired by the incum bents, since, chiefly on financial grounds, this post is liked by most of them. A somewhat unfortunate incident occurred on the 14th September: the ' Persepolis ' arrived from Bushire with some 80 or 100 Angali tufangchis on board, who had been sent here to protect the town owing to the rumoured Baharlu raid at the beginning of the month. They landed from the '' Persepolis ' very early in the morning with two or three rifles apiece ; orders had on previous occasions been issued that tufangchis were only to be allowed to land with one rifle apiece, and that any spare rifles which they had in their possession were to be deposited with the Customs. The Customs tufangchis accordingly endeavoured to enforce these orders in the present instance, but met with a strenuous opposition which ultimately culminated in a fracas in which shots were exchanged : the ferash-bashi of the Customs, who was merely an onlooker at the proceedings, was killed. A Customs ferash was seriouslv wounded in two places, and one of the chiefs of the Angalis was killedL This enraged the Angalis who proceeded to the Custom House, where they nearlv succeeded in killing Monsieur Pater, a Dutch Customs employ^. Finally, however, the Deputy Governor and the Director of Customs managed to pacify them, and most of them were sent out into the district, and later on sent back to Bushire. Unfortunately it was impossible to take any steps to prevent the import of the rifles, which were rapidly disposed of with the suspected collusion of the Deputy Governor. It was subsequently ascertained that these rifles had been sent by certain Bushiris to other Bushiris resident in Bandar Abbas, the tufangchis receiving 7 Tomans a rifle for conveying them. Representations were subsequently made regarding the part played by the Deputy Governor in this affair, and it was on this account that he was ulti mately dismissed. On the 1st May the British India Steam Navigation Company revised the British interests. programme of sailings of their mail steamers. Bandar Abbas had previously been well served with an inward and outward steamer every week. This service, however, was changed for one by which an inward steamer called in one week, and an outward the following. The mail service was not much affected by this change since arrangements were made for the fast mail to call in at Lingah and drop mails there alternate weeks from Bandar Abbas to be brought down by the inward slow mail. Universal complaints have, however, been made by shippers regarding the new service, and it is now no uncommon thing for cargo to be lying here a month or six weeks before being shipped. Additional steamers have been sent up nearly every week, but they very seldom call in here on their inward journey, and hence do not take cargo destined for Indian ports.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 54 The Russian Govermnent have maintained a native Consular Agent here . T . . during the year, but he does nothing, and oreign n eves s. i s ^ re0 eive no salary. The ships of the Russian Steam Navigation Company paid four calls each way during the past year, but seldom brought more than a few bales of cargo. The Ham burg-Amerika line have maintained a monthly service, and the total value of the cargo carried by these vessels from and to this port on the other hand from October 1909 to the end of September 1910, the only period for which statis tics are available, amounted to £49,199, an increase of nearly 66 per cent, over the preceding year. Tihere were rumours during the summer that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. contemplated opening a branch here; and they even got as far as enquiring about a house : the Assistant, however, who was coming to open the branch fell ill and the project did not mature, and appears to have been dropped for the time being. Assistant Surgeon Lincoln was Quarantine Medical Officer till 10th r . .. August when he was relieved by Assist ant Surgeon Smith from Bushire, and transferred to Mohammerah'. In spite of outbreaks of plague at nearly all the other Gulf Ports, no cases occurred at Bandar Abbas, nor was any other disease epidemic. At the beginning of the year a report was received that an Afghan Arms Traffic oaravan had passed through Regan on its way to Bandar Abbas. The Consul ate Guard was in consequence increased by the addition of 1 native officer and 34 non-commis'sioned officers and men of the 117th Mahrattas from Jask. The report, however, appears to have been incorrect, at any rate as far as the destination of the caravan was concerned, and no Afghan caravan arrived during that winter. The detachment was reduced to its normal strength of 16 rank and file in May. Up to the close of the year no news of the arrival of any Afghan caravan had been received. An infiltration of arms undoubtedly continues, but in very small numbers, and such as are brought into the town seem to come from the direction of Lingah. Thirty-seven slaves took refuge at the Consulate during the past year, g laveB out of which number 16 were manumit ted, the remainder being either restored amicably to their masters, or leaving the Consulate while their cases were under investigation.

There was no change in the staff of the Consulate during the year. His iMaiesty's Secretary of State for Foreign British Consu ate. Affairs, with the concurrence of the Government of India, sanctioned the change of Mirza Nasrullah Khan's designation from 'Attach^' to 'Honorary British Vice-Consul.' On the occasion of the Coronation Durbar at Delhi, the Vice-Consul received the Kaisar-d-Hind medal (second class). Lieutenant-Colonel Haig was absent from headquarters from March 27th to May 18th, during which time he visited Bandar Abbas, travelling down by the Jiruft route and returning by Daulatabad and Baft. Dr. Shiraieff held acting charge of the Russian Consulate throughout the ^ , year. The strength of his escort, which Russian Consulate. i i i i i . . , ., had been reduced to two by the with drawal of time-expired men, was raised to nine by the arrival of a relief in December. Prince Jalal-ud-Dowleh arrived as Governor-General of the Province, Political Events. ™ January but was dismissed, chiefly, it is believed, owing to the intrigues of Sardar-i-Nusrat, Commander of the troops, in July. His principal act was the despatch of an expedition under Sardar-i-Nusrat to Western Baluchistan. The force left Kerman on February 18th, far too late in the season, for Persians are incapable of enduring the heat of Baluchistan an the summer, and re turned on July 1st, having suffered much from the heat and effected nothing. Sardar-i-Nusrat retired from the fort of Fahraj leaving Bahram Khan in possession of it, and appointed to the government of Western Baluchistan the rebel Saiyid Khan (Rifat-i-Nizam) who had come to Bahram Khan's assist ance. He attempted to conceal his discomfiture by bringing back an insigni ficant sum of money and by taking from Saiyid Khan an agreement to pay revenue, which was not worth the p-aper on which it was written. The inde pendence of Western Baluchistan may be regarded for the present as a settled fact, and its reconquest will be a matter of some difficulty, for since Sardar-i- Nusrat's flight Saiyid Khan has not only not remitted any revenue to Kerman, but has expended what he has been able to collect in re-arming his men. Khalifah Khair Muhammad alias QuvVat-ul-Islam, the Afghan, is now settled in the country, and his activity in the traffic in arms is limited only by such measures as may be taken in the Gulf. The Baluchis have made many raids into the Province of Kerman, have ravaged the district of Narmashir and considerable tracts in the districts of Kashit, Khabis, Ravar, Kuhpaya, Rafsinjan, and Sirjan, and have, besides plundering the crops, flocks, herds, and personal property of the inhabitants, carried many women into slavery. On July 4th, shortly before the sudden dismissal of Prince Jalal-ud- Dowleh, a Parsi was stabbed in the town and the murderer took refuge in a' village belonging to Sardar-i-Nusrat, the inhabitants of which drove off the men who were sent by Jalal-ud-Dowleh to arrest him. Before another attempt could be made to seize him, the order for Jalal-ud-Dowleh's dismissal had arrived and the murderer was safe. No effort was made to arrest him and he was ultimately supplied with the means of retiring to Meshed, where he is now said to be. The Parsis of the town, fearing an outbreak of fanaticism, took hast in the Consulate and Sardar-i-Nusrat s endeavours to persuade them to leave were interrupted by the inopportune murder of another Parsi, one of the bastis, who was going to the town to buy food.ADMN. REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL REStDENCY FOR 1911. 56 The murderer of the second Parsi is said to be well known, but no action has been taken, on the plea that it is difficult to obtain evidence. The bastis were at length persuaded to leave the Consulate on July 23rd. At this time a riot against the Parsis of Bam was organized, but was promptly suppressed by some of the local Khans. The news of the ex-Shah's return to Persia excited some interest but stirred no deep feelings. The Azarbaijani Turks and others were opposed to his cause, but the general sentiment seemed to be that, despite his former failure, any state of affairs was to be preferred to the feeble and corrupt rule of the Medjliss. Opinions were, as a rule, guardedly expressed as long as the issue remained doubtful, but the local Qajar Khans consulted the Consul regarding the despatch of a telegram of welcome and congratulation to Muhammad Ali Mirza. ! &gt; After the dismissal of Prince Jalal-ud-Dowleh Sardar-i-Muhiyy was appointed Governor-General of Kerman ' and Baluchistan.' There was much agitation in Kerman against this appointment. Numbers of people, instigated by local demagogues, took hast in the Persian Telegraph Office and sent vehement telegrams of protest to Tehran, and so much violence was used against the carpet weavers to compel them to support the agitation by stop- ping work and joining the hastis in the Persian Telegraph Office that they took hast in the Consulate and would not leave until they had been guaranteed against molestation. The appointment of Sardar-i-Muhiyy was cancelled either in consequence of the agitation or because his services were required against the ex-Shah. The opposition to the appointment seems to have arisen from his reputation which indicated that he was likely to be an efficient governor, and therefore obnoxious to the local demagogues and office-holders. The news of the action taken by Russia in Northern Persia caused more excitement than the normal attitude of the natives of Kerman to public affairs would seem to warrant. The bazaars were closed, the two Consulates were boycotted, a habitual visitor to the Russian Consulate was shot at and wounded, and shopkeepers and others, armed with guns and sticks, daily marched up and down and round about the square of the city with shouts of ' death or independence.' The public performance was regularly attended by the Acting Governor, Sardar-i-Nusrat, as a follower rather than a leader of public opinion. The agitation was unfortunately at its height in December, when the Coronation Durbar was held in Delhi. The local officials declined to accept the hospitality of the Consulate, from which they are not usually averse, and it was impossible to persuade anybody to undertake the illumination of the Consulate. Despite the absence of illuminations, of the Russian Consul, who was not disiposed to venture out after dark, and of the Persian officials, the occasion was celebrated in a fitting manner. The artificial nature of the anti-foreign agitation was exhibited by its instant suppression on the arrival, on December 15th, of Prince Amir-i-Azam who, having been appointed Governor-General in the place of Sardar-i- Muhiyy, had been much delay on his way from Tehran by disturbances in Yezd and its' neighbourhood. Shops were opened, drilling was stopped in Kerman and Bam, and cordial relations with the Consulates were at once re sumed. The districts of Rafsinjan and Sirj an have suffered much from Baharlus and other robbers from Fars, and have obtained no assistance from Kerman. Owing to the insecurity of the roads and the consequent accumulation in Kerman of large stocks of carpets which could not be despatched, one firm, Messrs. Castelli et Freres, discontinued the payment of wages due under con tracts to weavers. Some three hundred weavers took hast in the Consulate as a protest ostensibly against the cessation of payments, but actually against the inefficiency of the local Government, which either could not or would not maintain order on the roads. In ordinary circumstances these weavers would not have been admitted to hast, but as there was reason to believe that they might turn their resentment against the firm's agent, a British subject, they were received, and the question was taken up on the basis of the local Govern ment's responsibility for the security of the roads. With some difficulty a written undertaking to provide adequate escorts at all times on receipt of i 2ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF twenty days' notice was obtained from the Acting Goyernor and the arm, thus reassured, resumed payments and the weavers left the Consulate. No traveller passed through the C qh . Wtors. sular District during the year. The Post Office has been working under grave disadvantages. There is little fault to be found with the system, Post8 ' but the numerous robberies of posts on both the northern and southern roads and the detention of posts en route for fear of robbers have seriously inconvenienced merchants and all having correspondence with Europe, India, and other parts of Persia. The provincial post office was much neglected by the head of the department in Tehran, and at one time in the year the Postmaster complained that for five months neither he nor his staff had received any pay, nor had the contract allowance for the carriage of the posts between Kerman and Yezd been paid. He telegraphed to Tehran that the postal service could not be continued under these condi tions and that he proposed to close the post office. This action resulted in the issue of orders for the payment of arrears, but it is discreditable to the Persian Government that it can be induced to pay for the maintenance of a department only by the threat of a strike. It is still more discreditable to the Persian Government that it caunot be persuaded to fulfil its agreements. In November and December 1910 sums of money, amounting to Krans 23,100, the property of Hindu merchants of Kerman, were robbed from the post between Bandar Abbas and Kerman. The parcels of cash were insured by the Government which, having first de manded a delay of six months under the Persian Postal Law, have since taken no action in the case, though it has frequently been pointed out that the col lection of insurance fees without the intention of meeting just claims for loss is hardly to be distinguished from obtaining money by false pretences. The working of the Telegraph Department has been satisfactory in the Tele ra h face of difficulties. The Inspector of the 6 egrap s ' sixth sub-section was much delayed in his tour between Kerman and Anar by bands of robbers on the Yezd road, the local authorities having failed to fulfil their promise of increasing his escort. The payment of the mounted escort supplied by the Persian authorities for the protection of the Telegraph Office and Officers at Daha-yi-Baghu has been the source of continual trouble throughout the year. In spite of repeated promises to pay them regularly, the local authorities have from time to time allowed their pay to fall into arrears for two and three monthst, and it was only with the greatest difficulty, after threats of desertion by the sowars and on one occasion, a threat that they would help themselves from the Telegraph cash chest, that it was possible to obtain payment of the arrears. Mr. Fenn of the Telegraph Department, travelling to Kerman on transfer from Tehran, was twice robbed on the road, once between Tehran and Yezd and again between Yezd and Kerman. Mr. Gabler, travelling on transfer via Bandar Abbas to Bam, was twice fired at, but fortunately not hit, by Buchaqchi sowars in the employ of the Persian Government, near Bam. The sowars excused themselves on the plea that they took him for a Baluch, but as he was only 250 yards distant when they fired, this excuse cannot be accepted, and as Mr. Gabler has received no apology a claim for compensation has been presented. The condition of the roads throughout the year has been deplorable. Eoada. three principal routes between Kerman and Bandar Abbas, the Sirjan and Baft roads have been infested by Buchaqchis and Afshars and by Bahar- lus and other robbers from Fars; and the Jiruft road, usually reputed the safest of the three, has been infested by Baluchis and other robbers. Buchaq- cnis and Baluchis have also infested the roads between Kerman and Bani) and robbers from Fars the roads between Kerman and Yezd. Eobberies have been numerous on all roads, and the Hindu merchants have sufifered severely- ine increased activity of Buchaqchis was attributed by popular rumourpolitical residency for 1911. 58 corroborated by circumstantial evidence, to their encouragement by the acting governor who was believed to have received a percentage on robberies com mitted. Owing to the insecurity of roads, freights between Bandar Abbas and Kerman have not fallen, but still range between 35 and 40 Tomans (£7 and £8) per kharwar of 650 lbs. The Kerman branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia has been open Baiik throughout the year. Mr. Nelson, the Manager, went on leave in March and was succeeded by Mr. Newman, the Accountant, whose place was taken by Mr. Gardner from Yezd. The Reverend N. V.

The province was free from epidemic Epidemic Disease. , . .i r disease throughout the year. At 9 p.m . on the night of April 18th, there were three shocks of earthquake at intervals of five minutes, the first lasting about ten seconds and the other two about five seconds each. This earthquake damaged some buildings in the town but caused no loss of life in Kerman. In the Ravar district, however, many dwelling-houses and carpet-weaving factories were destroyed, and about fifty lives were lost. From this time until May 2iKi slight shocks of earthquake were frequently felt and, though no damage was done, many of the people, alarmed by the news from Ravar, moved from houses in the town into gardens beyond the walls. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kerman,CHAPTER V. ADMINISTRATION EEPORT FOR THE PERSIAN MEKRAN COAST FOR THE YEAR 1911. Mr H Whitby Smith was in Political charge of the Mekran Coast up to the afternoon of 10th March 1911 when he proceeded on leave. He was relieved by Mr. R. C. Campbell who held charge up to the afternoon of 18th July, the date of his retirement, when Mr. R. C. Barker, C.I.E., assumed charge. Persian Baluchistan was, considering the condition of other parts of Persia during the year, quiet. The GeneraL chief feature of the year under report was the great decrease in the quantity of arms and ammunition imported into Persian Mekran. This was due to the blockade admirably maintained by the Royal Navy. In spite of this, arms in very small quantities have found their way into the interior. The Afghans, having lost heavily in previous years, did not come to the coast in stich numbers as was contemplated at the commencement of the year. Such as came employed themselves in purchasing arms from the Baluchis; they obtained a very small number as compared with previous years. The arms smuggled by Baluchis from Maskat passed through Karwan in the jurisdiction of Sardar Islam Khan of Bint. Sardar Saiyid Khan imported at the beginning of the year, with the permission of the British authorities, 50 rifles and pistols and 40,000 rounds of ammunition. He again sought permission to import further arms but was only given permission to import 25 rifles and 5,000 rounds. Not being satisfied with this number, he returned the permit to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs. Mir Din Muhammad Khan and Mir Mahmud Khan, joint Chiefs of Dashtiari District, and Mir Ashraf Khan and Mir Ahmed Khan of Bahoo District were, with the permission of the Political Resident, Bushire, respectively allowed to import 14 rifles, 6 pistols and 4,000 rounds of ammunition; eight rifles and 1,600 rounds; two rifles with' the usual proportion of cartridges, also 200 revolver cartridges and five rifles and 1,000 rounds with which to protect the telegraph lino passing througK their country. In February, Jalal Khan, Chief of Gwetter, wrote for compensation for the de^th of a Persian subject killed by a shot fired from one of the preven tive cutters at a dhow in which he was employed, under the impression that the dhow was smuggling arms. After a long correspondence, the sum of Rs. 150 was paid by Major Craufurd, Intelligence Officer at Jask, to the family of the deceased through the Clerk in Charge, Charbar. In August, Sardar Din Muhammad Khan asked for the extradition of a murderer, one Aloo-bin-Khudabux, Arrest ' who had bolted to Karachi after com mitting the crime. Men sent by the Sardar to Karachi to identify the crimi nal returned to Charbar unsuccessful. Rupees 400, his share of the loot, was recovered from Mir Din Muham mad on account of a piracy committed, y - in 1910, by Mir Nawab Khan of Bahoo and Din Muhammad's servants on Arab boats belonging to the subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, and remitted to the Political Agent, Maskat, for payment to the victims. Nothing has been recovered from Mir Nawab Khan though efforts were made to get a like amount from him. No claim out of those proved and adjudicated on in meetings held ^ C1 . Charbar, in 1905 and 1906, was settled by the Chief of any one of the districts. The particulars of these claims were wired to His Britannic Majestys Legation at Tehran at their request.

Shahdad-bin-Abbas, a naturalised British Indian subject, was Wali of Charbar acting under orders of both Wal1 ' lyEir Mahmud Khan and Mir Din Muhammad Khan. In November 1911, it was reported that a subject of Mir Mahmud Khan had killed, in revenge, the Baluchi Murder ' servant of a British Indian subject. Efforts are being made to obtain compensation for the family of the deceased. During the year Mir Din Muhammad Khan came to Charbar and re covered Rs. 8-10-0 on account of house Local Taxes. teiX £ rom 33 British Indian subjects. This being illegal, he was ordered to refund the amount which he has done since the expiration of the year under report. In November, a Baluchi, a subject of Sardar Saiyid Khan of Gaih, smuggled a revolver and 140 rounds of Smuggling of Anns. ammunition into Charbar; these were confiscated and delivered to the Persian Customs. The smuggler was in cus tody from the 19th November to 13th December as a punishment. He was then released with the concurrence of Major Craufurd at Jask. In the same month Mir Mahmud Khan arrested four Afghans who were purchasing arms in Dashtiari and sent them to Charbar. They were handed over to the Military Department for disposal. Many matters in dispute among British Indian subjects have been settled by arbitration to the satisfaction judicial. p ar ties, also in correspondence with the Director at Karachi. Gwadur.

After inquiry the British Indian subject wqc fined Rs 40, with the concurrence of the Political Agent, Maskat; a moiety of this was tendered to the complainant for the injury sustained by him. He refused to accept the amount and proceeded to complain to the Sultan. The Sultan referred the matter to the Political Agent, Maskat, and sent the complainant back to Gwadur. As the man could not be persuaded to accept the amount, the case was dropped. In December the Nakhuda of a Kutchi boat returning from Bandar Abbas sold 120 bags of wheat to certain Sale of Cargo. British Indian and Maskat subjects as his own property and under a false name. The cargo belonged to one Tribho- vandass Kalidass of Bhavnagar. The case is under inquiry and remains unsettled. During the year twelve slaves, fugitives from Mekran, were deported to Karachi at the expense of the British Slaves • Government. A severe type of small-pox broke out in Gwadur in January. A vac cinator was sent there at the expense of Epidemics. the Indian Government. In all 281 i deaths occurred from the disease. Many matters in dispute among British Indian subjects, and also between them and the subjects of His Highness JudiciaL the Sultan, were settled by arbitration or by correspondence with the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs at Karachi. In August, two passengers of the S. S. 'Waroonga' from Maskat, residents of Baftan in Persia, landed smuggling of Arms. three rifles and 450 rounds of ammuni tion concealed in their luggage. They carried an old passport. The arms were seized by the Native Assistant, but, as his safety was threatened by the importers, a gun-boat was sent to Gwadur and the weapons delivered to the Commander. In November, three Persian Mekranis successfully^ smuggled into Gwadur six rifles and 800 rounds of ammunition ex S. S. 'Pandua' from Maskat. They proceeded inland where the arms were seized by the Mekran Levy Corps. In December, three inhabitants of Sarbaz landed three revolvers ex S. S. ' Kasara ' from Maskat. They were seized by the Native Assistant atid deposited with the Wali of Gwadur pending further inquiry. They produced a passport in favour of a sepoy of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. The Wali, without further reference, delivered the weapons to the smugglers who proceeded up-country where they raided four camels in British territory. The matter was duly reported to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Maskat. A report regarding the condition of the districts with which he is immediately concerned, by Mr. D.

Karachi; The 13th February 1912.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 62 M R . D. W. M. GUMBLEY'S REPORT ON THE CONDITION OF THE DISTRICTS WITH WHICH HE IS CONCERNED. I have the honour to submit a report on the condition of the country between Biyaban and Gwadur for the year 1911. Mir Haji has been the recognized Chief of the Biyaban District through- Biyaban District. ^ the l™*' HiS 1 mil&lt; \ mature makes . nim much too weak to be a successful Governor in Mekran, and has led to his making frequent appeals to the British Government for help against Barkat. Should we at any time cease to uphold Mir Haji, Mir Barkat will without doubt depose him, in fact Mir Barkat would have done so ere this had it not been that he feared our inter vention. The ill-feeling between them is of course due to the fact that Mir Haji took over the Governorship of the District when Mir Barkat was deported to Bushire at our instigation two years ago. At the beginning of February Saiyid Abdul Rahim, one of Barkat's chief followers, murdered a slave of Mir Haji's named Mattutah who had brought a letter from Mir Haji to Barkat in Bashkard. Saiyid Abdul Rahim accused the slave of being a spy. Towards the end of March Barkat came down to Bahmadi with his father-in-law, Ghoolam Husain, and a following of some three hundred Bashkardis. He said he wished to come to an understanding with Govern ment. On March 25th, Khan Sahib Dilmorad and Mustapha Khan were therefore sent out to meet him, but they were unable to induce him to come into the station as he said he was afraid he would be detained if he did so. He appeared to think that a British representative would go out to Gaigan to meet him; on finding that there was no likelihood of this, he left Bahmadi saying he would return straight to Bashkard, but instead of doing so he went into Biyaban where he looted the country between Karai and Sarzeh. He used great violence, cutting the ear-rings from the women's ears, pulling the rings from their noses, burning their huts and clearing the country of sheep, goats and cattle. He told the inhabitants that he intended harassing the country until he was recognized as Chief, and only those who followed him would be immune. At the end of May the Mekran Field Force, under Colonel Delamain, landed at Sirik and destroyed some of the property belonging to Barkat and his following in that part of Biyaban, as a punishment for his lawlessness. They then marched to Poshak Pass which was held by some of Barkat's following. In the fighting which followed twelve of Barkat's followers and two sepoys were wounded. Unfortunately after taking the defile % the Force retired; had they gone through Barkat and the whole of the property that he had looted from Karai and Sarzeh would probably have fallen into their hands. As it was Barkat spread a story that he had inflicted severe loss on Sirkar, which caused them to return to the coast and embark as expeditiously as possible. At the same time Barkat's house at Jask was destroyed by the 117th Mahrattas under instructions from the Admiral. After these opera tions Barkat lived quietly at Joshder in Bashkard till September when Mir Haji wrote to say that he (Barkat) had gone to Dubben and had killed one Shahdulla and his brother, and had wounded the former's wife and looted all their belongings. Shahdulla was engaged by Mr. Gregson at Gwaj as a guide to the Force engaged there last April, and his murder is a direct act of revenge for the assistance he then gave. In the middle of September Mir Barkat wrote to Khan Sahib Dilmorad expressing a desire to see me. He said he was afraid to come to Jask, but would come to meet me between Jagin and Gabreg when I was encamped there, if I would see him. With the approval of the Resident a reply was sent guaranteeing that he would not be detained if he came in.

Dostdeen and his two companions fired in the dark, killing a slave of Sher Muhammad's, named Araboo. Soon after returning from Charbar to Gaih last spring, the Persians, who had been unsuccessfully fighting Gaih District. Bahrain Khan, sent for Sardar Saiyid Khan to come to Bampur to take charge there. He has been in Bampur ever since and in consequence Mir Islam Khan has been slowly assuming niore power than Saiyid Khan considers him entitled to; this may shortly lead to fighting between them. Khalifa Khair Muhammad with his whole family came down to Kasim- abad, near Bampur, from Seistan in June and has remained in the country ever since, although the Persian Government have issued instructions to Sardar Saiyid Khan to turn him out. When I saw the Khalifa m Bmt this autumn he seemed very anxious to gain the good-will of the British Govern ment. tlis influence in the country seems to be on the wane except perhaps in Bint. The Mekran Field Force landed at Galag on the 10th April and inarched some 35 miles up the Rapch river from whence 90 mounted men, together with Sardar Saiyid Khan and Islam Khan, rode into Bint, and after a stay of a few hours the return march was commenced, which was without incident. The object of the march was to drive the Afghans back from the sea-board, but they had retreated on Fanooch when they heard a Force was coming. One of the indirect consequences was that, in May, the representative of Islam Khan in Karwan looted wheat from Jamedar Yakoob and Line-guard Jungoo, and severely beat the latter and his wife. This they said had been done under Islam Khan's instructions who, they said, wished all telegrapn employes hounded out of his country. His anger was apparently due to the fact that the above-mentioned men iad disclosed his real relations with the Afghans, to our knowledge of which he attributed the ride to Bint by Colonel Delamain's Force. He has since apologised for this, and declares the occur rence had not his sanction. He was most courteous when I visited him m Bint in October and when he came down to Rapch in December. Details of both these meetings were forwarded to you under my Nos. 30 of 12th November# and 35 of 18th December. Sardar Saiyid Khan appears to be annoyed to find that he cannot obtain a pass for all the rifles he wished to import. At the beginning of the year bitter enmity existed between Mahmud T - .. tv . ,, Khan and his nephew Mir Min Muham- Dashtian^District. ^ mad; Sardar Saiyid Khan was, however, able to effect their reconciliation during his southern tour last spring. An arrangement has been come to by which they share the revenue of Dashtian which has so far worked satisfactorily. In September, Mir Din Muhammad went to Rask to marry Mir Ali Muhammad's daughter; he returned in December and is now in Bahoo. Mir Ali Muhammad is the elder brother of Bahram Khan of Dizak. In February, Aree, a subject of Mir Din Muhammad, looted 160 goats, seven cows and four buffaloes from Talang close to Mahmud Khan's fort This was said to be done under instructions from Nawab Khan. In revenge, Mir Dhur, son of Mahmud Khan, went to Mirai Bazaar where Din Muhaifr mad was living and cut down 60 date trees and some fruit trees. On the 27th July, Mir Din Muhammad reported to the Clerk in Charge Charbar, that a Baluch had xobbed and killed an Afghan in his district,political residency i'or 1911. 64 In June, Din Muhammad's uncle, Mehrab-bin-Abdullah, was shot by Aloo, a sepoy of Mir Din Muhammad's. This was an act of revenge against Mir Din Muhammad whose maternal grandfather Mowladad shot Alloo's father some 15 years ago. Mir Ahme4, Mir Ashraf and J^awab Khan have been living on peaceful terms, the result beinff that the district Bahoo istnct. throughout the year. Last summer, whilst Mir Ahmed was • entertaining some Baluchis at Barrao, one of the guests, a Hot named Khan Muhammad, suddenly got up and shot Mir Alimed through the arm. The attempt on his life was due to the fact thiat Khan Muhammad's brother had been killed in a fight against Mir Ahmed some three years ago ^ the quarrel had, however, been settled, and Mir Ahmed did not suspect that any ill-feeling still existed against him. A fine of 300 Tomans has been imposed on the culprit. General. A decrease in the number of slaves exported is noticeable, though they continue to change hands in the country. There was an exceptionally good rainfall last winter and the past year has been one of abundance. There has been little rain this autumn, but the country is so well provided with grain that, should the crops be scanty in the coming year, there will be no shortage of grain. K 2CHAPTER VI.

J. H. Grey, I.A. Mr. W. N. Siqueira was Consular Dragoman and Mirza Ahmed Khan Consulate Mirza. The European colony in the district has grown steadily. Mohammerah contains 21 Europeans of whom 18 are British; in addition there are 37 British Indian subjects. Ahwaz 17 Europeans of whom 14 are British and 23 Indians. The oil-fields at Masjid-i-Suleiman contain 29 British of whom many are Canadian, and 30 natives of India. At the Abadan Refinery there are 17 British, 524 British Indians and 80 Chinese. Governors of Arabistan.; —The Governors of Arabistan changed with the Local officials. sam e frequency as those in other parts of Persia. At the beginning of the year Fakhr-ul-Mulk held the position, but he left for Kerbela on a pilgrim age, in January, returning on the 1st April to Mohammerah, proceeding to Ahwaz for Shushtar the same day. He was dismissed three weeks later, tha Karguzar being deputed to act temporarily. At the end of May Shahzadah Assadullah Mirza, Shahab-ed-Dowleh, was appointed Governor. He did not take up his appointment. In the middle of June Shahzadah Imad-ed-Dowleh was nominated to be his successor and left Tehran travelling md Kermanshah. While on his way the ex-Shah returned to Persia, and Salar-ed-Dowleh raised the standard of rtvolt at Kermanshah. Imad-ed-Dowleh joined him, thus creating a further vacancy in the appointment for Arabistan. ^Tizani—es—Sultaneh was appointed in October, as stated under 11 Inter nal Administration, but he did not take up the appointment. Finally, at the beginning of November, Ijlal-es-Sultaneh was appointed to the post. He is still the nominee, but at the close of the year has not yet arrived to take up his duties. 4? ^ )ver t nc J rs ^P ^ Arabistan does not confer very great powers, most of the country being under the rule of the Shaikh, the portion in the district of Ram Hormuz being administered by the Bakhtiari: thus leaving but bnusntar and Dizful to the nominal Governor of the Province.

Shaikh Sir Khaz al Khan, K.C.I.E., Sardar-i-Arfa, continued his rule during the year under report in which work he was assisted by Haji Rais-ut-ADMN. REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 66 Tujjar as Prime Minister. The two continued on excellent terms and there was at no time tne smallest cause for complaint on the part of this Consulate. Agha Abdi was, as previously, Governor of Mohammerah. Owing to the development of the town he was obliged to pay Liras 6,000 for the post in place of Liras 5,000. He has at all times shown a very friendly spirit to wards the Consulate and, in the summer, married a sister of Mirza Ahmed Khan, the Mirza of the Consulate. The Karguzar was at the opening of the year Itila-ed-Dowleh. This uz official's conduct was far from satis factory. It was very soon certain that he was sending various false reports to Tehran with reference to the relations of the Shaikh and the English. He seemed to be especially opposed to British interests, notably to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and continued malicious and libellous reports appeared in the Tehran papers as well as in those of Basrah and Baghdad the authorship of which was ascribed to him. In the month of July he was dismissed, his official reports having passed all credence and the Shaikh having refused to have any further dealings with him. With his dismissal the reports in the papers ceased, and there is no reasonable doubt that he was the author. He was a drunkard and, though from all sources he made an income of some £1,000 per annum, he was hope lessly in debt and unable to pay his way to Basrah on his departure. On the departure of the Karguzar, Haji Abdul Najid, Nusrat-ul- Tujjar, a nephew of Haji Rais's and formerly Mirza in this office, was appointed temporarily to act in his place pending the arrival of Ikram-ul- Mulk, the new nominee from Tehran. Ikram-ul-Mulk was formerly at Kerman and Seistan. In January, Haji Ijlal-el-Memalik was appointed Eais-i-Adlieh and continued so throughout the year. He proposes leaving for Tehran as he has no work and equally receives no pay. In March, Abul Saadat, an insignificant looking little man who appeared to be hardly sane, was appointed Rais-i-Nazmieh. He raised a police force of some 60 men but was seen no more after November. He was commonly known as the Maimmun Bashi, the monkey chief. Mustaufi-ul-Mulk was appointed Rais-i-Malieh in April and continued so throughout the year, residing mainly at Ahwaz. A ' young Persian,' he has more moderation and education than many but has been unable to succeed in doing much. Shaikh Chasib, eldest son of Sir Khazal Khan, Was Governor at Ahwaz most of the year, except for some time during the summer, when he went to Basrah to be placed under charge of the German doctor attached to Messrs. Wonckhaus with a view to treatment for syphilis. On his return he was placed in charge of the Shaikh's office in Mohammerah but returned to Ahwaz in November. In his absence Abdul Saiyid officiated. In July cholera appeared at Basrah having worked its way down from Amara. Epidemics of this disease are Epidemics, popularly supposed to occur about every seven years, first appearing either at Amara or the Muntafik, On July 16th, two cases occurred on the Persian gun-boat ' Persepolis ' in the Karun at Mohmmerah, both beinsj imported from Basrah. The ship was successfully disinfected and no further case occurred, but soon after other cases were discovered amongst people who had fled from Basrah and very shortly the disease had obtained a hold in Mohammerah in a most virulent form, in many cases those afflicted dying within a few hours of the first symptoms, rendering treatment practically impossible. It very shortly spread to Ahwa£ notwithstanding quarantine measures. The Jemadar and three sowars of the 35th Scinde Horse, who were travelling from Mohammerah to Ahwaz en route to Ispahan in relief of the Consular escort, were attacked and died.67 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The disease reached its height in the middle of August, gradually lessen ing in virulence and finally disappearing in October. In August, Lieutenant James, Mobile Assistant to the Quaran tine Officer, was deputed from Bombay to Mohammerah and assumed charge of quarantine and cholera affairs, twice visiting Ahwaz. No Europeans were attacked until September 28th when two died, one of the cases being probably imported, a third case occurred at Abadan on the S. S. ' Griqua ' and the patient, a Swede, was brought to the Quarantine Station at Mohammerah; details of these are given under ' Medical.' At Basrah Mrs'. Prioe, the wife of the Doctor, died, and also Mr. Blunt- some of the Bahrah Trading Company, and, late in the year, in December, Mr. Dods of Messrs. Lynch. In addition one or two European members of the crews of the ships in harbour died during the summer. The official return of deaths amounted to 240, but it is doubtful whether treble this figure would be too large, if all the straggling villages adjoining Mohammerah were included. It was altogether the worst epidemic that has occurred for many years. Various treatments were tried without any great success, and I think it may be taken that the latest methods, while no doubt excellent when they can be administered in a hospital with a trained staff, are quite useless for the treatment of an epidemic en Uoc. On the other hand, the preventive value of boiled water and general cleanliness in food were, I think, also clearly demonstrated. Notices giving general instructions were posted in the town and generally followed by the upper classes. A point of interest was that all the Europeans who were attacked were suffering from some other illness at the time or had been debilitated by previous sickness. The dispensary is in charge of the Quarantine Assistant Surgeon, and Medical the present arrangements under which that official has been out of pocket over the transaction have not been very satisfactory. The number of patients treated have been 242 per mensem. I have been supplied by Lieutenant James, I.M.S., with the following note regarding the class of disease treated.

Dr. W. F. Kay of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company died of cholera at Deaths. Ahwaz in January 1911. Mr. N. Ramsay, General Works Manager at Abadan, was invalided on the 10th June owing to tuberculosis and died on his way home. Mme. Petrez, wife of Monsieur Petrez, a Belgian Engineer in the em ploy of the Persian Government, died of cholera on the 29th August. Mr. F. J. Woolford, an employe of Messrs. Thorneycroft &amp; Co., died of cholera on the 28th August in the ' Anatolis ' while lying at Mohammerah. Mr. F. Anderson, a Swede, one of the crew of the S. S. ' Griqua' at Abadan, died of cholera at Mohammerah at the end of September. Mr. H. J. Lyle of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was sent to Karachi and died in hospital after being treated internally. Captain Boty, formerly a Belgian officer of the Persian Navy, died at Ahwaz. Mirza Hamza, the Shaikh's trusted Basrah Agent, who represented the Shaikh as Chief of the Muhaisin tribe and who was the husband of the Shaikh s sister-in-law, died at Bombay while on a visit. The quarantine cor^trol was in the hands of Assistant Surgeon G. C. ^ . &gt; Eehling until 24th August when Assist- Quarantlne - ant Surgeon C. H. Lincoln, formerly stationed at Bandar Abbas, arrived and took over the duties of the post. Mr. Eehling was temporarily transferred to Ahwaz from 6th September to 13th December. Affairs ran without friction throughout the year. It has been determined, after reference to the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, that two quarantine guards shall be stationed at the Abadan Oil Refinery to enable tankers to fill while still in quarantine. As the Customs, as noted, already have a surveillance post at Abadan there will be no trouble under this head. Monsieur George Delcroix officiated as Provincial Director of Customs until the first week of May when Mon sieur Zwinne returned from leave. Monsieur Zwinne before hjs departure had, as noted in my predecessor's report, made himself very unpopular by the strictness with which he had interpreted his regulations, and as a result, when it became known that he was to be again nominated to the post, a movement originated with the object of preventing his return. The Shaikh telegraphed to Tehran opposing the appointment and the merchants in the bazaar refused to take delivery of any goods while there was any possibility of the nomination being persisted in. His Majesty's Consulate supported this movement by informing the Minister in Tehran of the complaints against Monsieur Zwinne and acting as an inter mediary for the Shaikh. This action was taken not in any way against Monsieur Zwinne, who, though unpopular, had kept on good terms with His Majesty's representative, but owing to the fact that there seemed to be a tendency, in fact a very strong tendency, to regard as negligible the rights of the Shaikh under his firman as Director-General of Customs to approve of all such employes before their final appointment. Owing to the representation of the Minister and the action of the Shaikh and merchants. Monsieur Zwinne was finally transferred temporarily to Bandar Abbas and Monsieur Delcroix confirmed at Mohammerah. At the end of 1910 the question arose of the appointment of a Belgian official to the Customs at Nasiri to which the Shaikh was greatly opposed, urging that it was against the terms of his firman, and would upset his Arabs, while it in no way benefited him, the fact being that the goods handled were in transit to Tehran and Ispahan, a source of increased expenditure and responsibility to himself. The good offices of His Majesty's Legation were accorded and the matter eventually arranged on the understanding that an iallowance of 250 Tomans per mensem should be granted to the Shaikh.A# ^ § 69 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Monsieur Delcroix has throughout the year shown a very friendly dis position and willing to meet any objection raised. The Customs has not, however, been very satisfactorily managed. The fact that the Director can speak but little Persian places him absolutely in the hands of his subordinates, and there has been a great amount of fraud and even pilfering. The Customs which are hypothecated for the payments of British dues do not receive anything like the amounts that they should obtain. Firms exporting grain can always, sharing the profits of the fraud with the Persian Customs officials, get their stock through by declaring but half the amount, thus saving 25 per cent, of the Customs dues for themselves. This method of business is not followed by any of the British firms employed with the result that Messrs. Wonckhaus, Messrs. Asfar and other foreign shippers are in a position to offer half a Lira per Tagar or 6 per ton more than British firms can afford to give for grain—to the detriment of British interests. The matter is under notice of His Majesty's Consul and the British firms who ship grain. ' The Bank, who are largely interested since they now re ceive all Customs payments, are also taking up the matter. Telegraphs. The Telegraph Service has been un satisfactory practically throughout the year. In March, Mr. Christmas of the Indo-European Telegraph Department arrived in Arabistan to superintend the repair of the telegraph line. He reported that between Shakur and Nasiri 230 wooden telegraph poles had been stolen, and that between Nasiri and Saneh 840 were missing, being approximately 90 per cent, of the whole line. The state of affairs between Mohammerah and Ahwaz, though better in detail, was no better in practice. During the spring Mr. Christmas worked at the line and, purchasing new poles and obtaining a few as a gift from the Shaikh, had it in good trim up to the time he left, in July, when gradually the old state of affairs returned, poles were stolen, officials slack, and by the end of the year the line out of working order once more. In the month of October the local British firms made a joint complaint to His Majesty's Consul stating that, since the Italian-Turkish War, they had not been able to make use of the Basrah line as the Turks would not accept messages in code and that, since the local line was quite unreliable, they were severely handicapped in their business. The traffic between Arab istan and Bushire being equally affected, I forwarded this letter to the Resident making certain suggestions and requesting that the Minister might be approached on the subject. I trust that this representation will result in a line which will work satisfactorily, for the present state of affairs entails much loss to the local British firms who are unable to receive their buying rates, and the Bank is equally handicapped with reference to exchange. The work of the British Post Office has steadily augmented. In 1910, p ost8 the value of 2,285 money orders issued . ' was Rs. 1,83,485; in 1911, this amount nas risen to 4,164 orders aggregating Rs. 2,22,414; registered articles have risen from 2,989 to 3,513 and parcels from 1,718 to 3,034, while there has been a corresponding increase in the number of letters received and issued.

Lynch Brothers, who keep their head offices at Ahwaz for grain purchase, in January again appointed an European Agent to Mohammerah in place of the Indian clerk who had held charge. In December the ' Julnar,' their new boat which, so it was found, did not suit the Tigris was given a trial run on the Karun and still continues on the river as a temporary measure. Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. of London are represented at Mohammerah by Messrs. Asfar &amp; Co. of Basrah who during the year acquired the lease of a wharf on the river for the conduct of the grain export. At the end of the year Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. took a wharf and appointed a European to Mohammerah. A large part of the Mohammerah business is in American oil from the Standard Oil Company, but they also propose exporting grain and doing other general trade. The work of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company progressed steadily through out the year though handicapped, more especially at the Abadan Eefinery, by the cholera epidemic and the month of Ramzan which followed it with its fasts and the consequent inability of the employes to perform their accus tomed task. The pipe line was completed on the 22nd June and stood its test most successfully. Oil reached Abadan on the 25th October and had cholera not come the refinery would no doubt have been in working order by the New Year. A growing village of some 1,200 souls has sprung up on what was formerly but a bare plain and solidly constructed buildings for the European staff occupy the river front. At Mohammerah the new quarters and offices should be finished by the spring. The telephone line connecting Ahwaz, Abadan and Mohammerah was terminated with the pipe line. The Company, in December, was employing in all 45 Europeans, 485 British Indians, 30 Chinese and 1,900 Persians and Turks. The Imperial Bank of Persia completed their new offices on the banks of the river Karun in the town of Mohammerah in December 1910. The Manager's house, an imposing edifice higher up the stream, was occupied in May 1911 and the Accountant's house will shortly be completed. The bank business has steadily increased since its inauguration, in Janu ary 1910, and the work at its busiest is almost too much for the staff of a Manager and one Accountant. The date season has been unsatisfactory owing to the absence of the ^ ^ A 0 moisture-laden south winds the want of The Dcite S bsisoii. i*i iji -i . • n ii which caused the dates, especially the better qualities, to be dried up. In consequence of the north wind the sum mer, though more bearable, was hot, the thermometer registering over 110° in the shade, a high temperature for a climate which, though drier than the true Gulf, is still moist. In September, H. M. S. ' Odin ' arrived to prevent piracy during the date season. She patrolled the river until the end of December when she was recalled to Bushire for the landing of the troops in consequence of the disturbances at Shiraz. The grain season has been one of the most satisfactory on record. In all ^ . o 22,000 tons of grain were exported at a The rain Season. value of about £96,000. The figures have been taken from the Customs statistics. Probably 50 per cent, would more accurately represent the actual exports. There is little to note under this head T . , AJ A . as far as the Shaikh's territories are Internal Administration. concerned. Sir Khaz'al maintained his usual firm rule with the assistance of Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar. In general it may be said that, in internal matters, the71 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF latter gives his advice, but in matters dealing with foreigners or in general policy and trade he has the greater say and usually determines the issue. The Shaikh is accepted and his influence strong throughout his district, but it is said that, with regard to the Beni Turuf and such outlying frontier tribes, his power has been greatly increased owing to the belief that, having received the K.C.I.E., he is now under British protection. This belief is very common and indeed the recent troubled state of Persia has hardly affected the Arab mind for they say ' since the Shaikh is under British protection and we under the Shaikh's it makes but little difference to us whether there is a Shah in Persia or not or whether the Russians take it or leave it, we shall be safe.' At times the old question of the Bakhtiari rivalry has been dangerous. ou uv. . ti 11 x- The Shaikh informs me that he has tried Shaikh and Bakhtiane. ., n . ^ o ■ n- . the policy oi friendliness with that im portant tribal confederacy, but that, owing to the various factions which exist amongst them and the absence of a single powerful head, friendliness with any one section only results in increased enmity with another and that, as the friendship made does not bear any strain, any such attempts do but make the situation worse. In consequence his attitude is one of watchful suspicion. On the other hand it is I think doubtful if the Bakhtiari Chiefs are aware of the provoca tive acts of their henchmen whose highly coloured reports convince them that the Shaikh and his followers are guilty of aggressions on their rights and on their subjects. The triple alliance of the Shaikh, the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh and Sowlet- Mstarbanoes at shushtar. ed-Dowkh, made as a buffer against the Bakhtians, continued since no demands were made upon it. The only thing which could, I think, make it ever mate rialise into actual reality would be Bakhtiari aggression against two of its members at the same time. Were only one attacked the others would give their moral support and assistance, but beyond that they would not go. The troubles which so constantly break out at Shushtar, the supposed centre of Government, owe much to the fact that that town is the headquar ters of the borderland where the Shaikh and Bakhtiari meet. Each Mohalla possesses a feudal lordling whose condition, when at peace, is not one of plenty while, on the other hand, when disturbances arise, he levies a contribu tion for the defence of his quarter which provides him with a living, thus the conditions are perfect for trouble, the Bakhtiari party accuse the Shaikh of stirring up strife, the Shaikh suspects the Bakhtiaris, while between the two the Aghawat of the Mohallas eke out an honest existence. The situation has parallels in the medieval history of Italian towns. I propose in the coming year as soon as a Governor appears, if that desirable condition should ever be attained, to spend part of my time in bhushtar and trust I may be able to arrive at some solution for this difficulty or at any rate to determine the facts clearly, which is the first step to that end, if the end is attainable. oo i Il i/r May disturbances broke out in Shushtar and, from the 17th to the 28th May, ^ shops were closed and no business could be done, and the ' Shushan,' Messrs. Lynch's steamer, was unable to run. Shaikh Murteza, a proteg^ of the Bakhtiaris, and a lay member of the family of Shushtar, had been expelled from Shushtar by the bhaikh the previous year. One of the chiefs of a Mohalla, Agha Shakrullah by n &amp; m o, yho had also been expelled, was soon allowed to return and, in March, Saiyid Murteza was permitted to follow his example. Soon after, instigated, it is said, by the Bakhtiaris, he stirred up feeling once more and, assisted by the son of Moin-ut-Tujiar, started a disturbance against Agha Muhammad Zeman, one of the Shaikh's adherents. Since there was no Governor, the Central Government asked the Shaikh to take steps to put an end to the disturbances. The Shaikh agreed to do so, but asked that his expenditure should be guaranteed and his actions indemni-POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 72 fied. I telegraphed to His Majesty's Minister supporting the Shaikh and pointing out that there was no one else who could deal with the situation. In reply the Minister stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed him that the Shaikh had not been asked at any time to put down the troubles at Shushtar and later repeated the statement in saying that measures the Shaikh subsequently had taken had been entirely on his own authority. Subsequently I was able to dispose of these statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs by sending His Majesty's Minister, in original, the orders received by the Shaikh from the Prime Minister of Persia. It is statements of this nature which make the Shaikh so nervous about the Bakhtiaris and convince him that their influence at Tehran works evil for him. To resume, the disturbances which broke out again in July continued intermittently wherein Sir Khaz'al despatched Shaikh Handzal with 1,000 men to put an end to the undesirable state of affairs. Amir Kuli Khan and Dorab Khan, Bakhtiari, with a hundred of their men immediately went to Imamzadah Abdulla in order to prevent the Shaikh's troops entering Shushtar. The Shushtaris, however, got nervous at the turn things* were taking, and finally sent out a party consisting of the Mustaufi, the Kalantar and Amir Kuli Khan to meet Shaikh Handzal and parley; in the meantime Shaikh Murteza with his party leaders fled into Bakhtiari country and the disturbances terminated. Moatamid-el-Vizarah, Deputy Governor in place of Assadullah Mirza, arrived at Shushtar at the end of July, tie immediately imprisoned all the Aghawat or chiefs of quarters including those to whom assurances of safety had been given. On the intervention of the Shaikh they were released and the Deputy Governor returned to Mohammerah. Shaikh Handzal, the Shaikh's deputy, continued as Deputy Governor till September when he was relieved by Mulla Abdul Saiyid, who had been acting for Shaikh Chasib at Ahwaz. It will be seen then that the Shaikh's authority has been paramount throughout the year, a fact which the Bakhtiaris would not care to tolerate. All that is needed to put an end to these faction fights is an agreement be tween the rival chiefs of the bordering countries; whether such an agreement is possible or whether the interests are too conflicting is a point which remains to be decided. Nizam-es-Sultaneh. —Early in the year the Nizam-es-Sultaneh passed through Mohammerah on his way to take up his post as Governor-General of Fars. He stayed some days with the Shaikh, during which their general relations were discussed and many matters settled. The Shaikh states that the Nizam left with the intention of keeping on friendly terms with the British; that he did not maintain this commendable frame of mind and what happened subsequently will be found elsewhere in this volume. In any case he was finally discredited and dismissed, but almost imme diately after appointed Governor-General of Arabistan, the general idea here being that the appointment was merely to enable him to leave Shiraz in safety, as otherwise his enemies might not have allowed him to depart in peace. Later, orders arrived for his arrest; these orders were no doubt due to the predominance of Bakhtiari influence in Tehran, an influence which was in favour of the Kawam-ul-Mulk and consequently was opposed to the Nizam. The latter notwithstanding succeeded in escaping to his own properties near Daliki where he was temporarily safe from his enemies, and from whence he proceeded to appeal for help to his old friend Shaikh Khaz'al. The enmity between the Shaikh and the Bakhtiari has been referred to above;—if the Shaikh had now left the Nizam to find his own way out of his difficulties as best he could, the latter would have been obliged to make the best terms he could with the Bakhtiari, which might have meant for the Shaikh the thrusting of a long wedge of Bakhtiari influence right into his territories, and the defection of a large portion of it which he had hitherto l 2ADMN.

Accordingly, in the beginning of December, accompanied by Haji Rais, he left for Hindij an to extricate the Nizam, who in due course reached Mohammerah in safety where he remained at the end of the year. Throughout the year the Shaikh cultivated good relations with the Turkish authorities at Basrah. He paid visits to, and received visits from, the Walis of that place using the house of a third person in his visits to avoid difficulties. He also frequently visited his friend the Nakib Saiyid Talib, the Turkish Deputy for the Basrah Vilayet, and son of the Nakib stayed a night with him on his way to Constantinople. The Shaikh's friendship with the Shaikh of Kuwait continued as firm as ever, and the latter paid continued visits to Mohammerah and was here at the close of the year. Shaikh Khaz'al, who rarely leaves his own districts, visited Kuwait in the autumn. Each constantly consults the other in all matters. L. B. H.

Pusht-i-Kuh. —Ghulam Riza Khan, Amir-i-Jang, retained his position as semi-independent ruler of the district throughout the year. Luristan.—The commencement of the year found the Amir Afghan appointed to the Governor-Generalship of this province and he reached Burujird in March. In April, another appointment was made in the person of Lutf Ali Khan, Amir Mufakham. This official governed the district with great ability until his departure in August to suppress the Salar-ed-Dowleh. After his defeat on that occasion the district remained without a Governor on the part of the Persian Government until the close of the year. Bakhtiari. —The posts of Ilbegi and Ilkhani of the Eakhtiaris were held respectively by Ghulam Hussain Khan, Sardar Muhtesham and Jaffer Kuli Khan, Sardar-i-Bahadur. These Chiefs on being summoned to Tehran, in July, to lead their forces against the ex-Shah, left the charge of the tribes to Salar-i-Ashraf and Muntazim-ed-Dowleh who continued to act as Ilbegi and Ilkhani until the close of the year. Kuhgilu. —At the commencement of the year Bahadur-i-Diwan was Deputy Governor of Behbehan. On the arrival of Nizam-es-Sultaneh at Shiraz he nominated Yamin-es-Sultaneh for the post, the latter taking up his duties in February. His arrival was the signal for disturbances in the town due to the intrigues of Bahadur-i-Diwan who desired by this means -to disgust the Yamin with his charge, and hoped that he would ask for per mission to resign and that he himself would be re-appointed to the Deputy Governorship of the town. The Nizam-es-Sultaneh, seeing that the Yamin was incapable of restoring order, recalled him and appointed the Commander of the troops, which had accompanied him from Shiraz, to take over the Governorship in his place. In October, when the Nizam-es-Sultaneh was dismissed, the Bahadur-i- Diwan resumed the Governorship. In October, Amir Mujahid (Yusuf Khan), Bakhtiari, was nominated for the Deputy Governorship and he deputed Khuda Karam Khan and Mahmud Khan to proceed to Behbehan and officiate for him until his arrival. These two minor Khans got as far as Ram Hormuz but lack of funds prevented them from proceeding further. After waiting there for some weeks and communicating with Amir Mujahid by telegraph they returned to their homes. Amir Mujahid had not taken over his appointment by the close of the year, Bahadur-i-Diwan continuing as nominal Deputy Governor.76 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP Mirza Jalal Khan was Director of Customs until the 17th of September Custoina when he was relieved by M. Fourman, the new Belgian Director from Bandar Abbas. In March, the Customs Department received orders to credit all their receipts to the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the special privilege which Messrs. Lynch Brothers' Ahwaz agency hitherto enjoyed of paying their Ahwaz customs dues in Tehran by draft was withdrawn. At the commencement of the year Amanulla Khan, the rebellious son of Pusht-i-Kuh t] } e Wali . of p usht-i-Kuh, was in rebel lion against his father. Peace was made in February and Amanullah Khan took up his residence with his father at Kunjian Chamm. In Jime, Amanulla Khan again conceived the idea of deposing his father and taking over the administration of the country himself. He was encour aged in this idea by the ' Ghulams ''—or Kaka Siah—the descendants of slaves brought into the country by the ancestors of the present Wali who have gradually acquired wealth and great influence in the country. The ' Ghulams ' hoped to be liberally rewarded by Amanulla Khan when, by their help, he would be established in his father's place. An opportunity presented itself when the Wali left his summer headquarters at Deh Bala on a shooting expedition with a small escort. Amanulla, promising rewards to the Wali's 'Amala left at Deh Bala for their support, started off with a large following to meet his father who was returning from his shooting excursion. On seeing him he explained that he had decided to take over the government of the country and had him quietly escorted to the chief Qaleh where he was placed under guard. Immediately the plot was successful and Amanulla Khan established as ruler, the Ghulams and others who had helped him commenced to clamour for their promised rewards. Some demanded villages and others remission of re^eiue on their lands. The new Wali put off these troublesome claimants as long as possible, but, feeling his position insecure and fearing that one of his late supporters would rise against him and oust him in turn from the rulership he thought it better to retire from the position, reinstate his rather and make the best terms possible for himself. Accordingly he approached his father, acknowledged his incapacity to rule the country and asked his forgiveness for his treatment of him, and requested him to resume the rulership. The Amir-i-Jang as usual forgave his son and resumed the administration. i A month later Amanulla again began interfering in the Governorship t gU H g 7 lth the y al T ' S enemies - Th&lt; ' Wali then had him forcibly the Ke ™ anshah bolder, where he was ordered to inwfLI followers.

Once there he quickly took steps to establish order throughout the country, appointed capable revenue officials and re-opened the postal and caravan roads. In August, the news of the ex-Shah's attempt to regain the throne again threw the country into disorder, the trouble being aggravated by letters addressed to the Luristan tribal Chiefs by the Salar-ed-Dowleh calling on them to support him and promising liberal rewards to all who joined his standard. Shortly afterwards the Amir himself received orders from the Central Government to march against the Salar-ed-Dowleh and crush him. He left for this purpose, was defeated by the Salar and returned to his property at Kamareh. On his departure there was no responsible Governor of Luristan, but .Nazar Ali (Fath-es-Sultan, Sardar Akram), the Chief of the Amrai, carried on the government on behalf of the Salar-ed-Dowleh. On the Salar's advance towards Saweh, Nazar Ali accompanied him and, when defeated, the two returned to Nazar Ali's property at Tehran. With Nazar Ali's help the Salar raised another force of Lurs and occu pied Burujird without resistance. In December, he was defeated and ex pelled from that town by the Bakhtiari force sent against him by the Central, Government under the command of Salar Muvaed (Fatha Ali Khan), the son of Amir Mufakham. Salar Muvaed soon left Luristan and the country was again left without any controlling authority until the close of the year. Throughout the year the Samsam-es-Sultaneh has been Ilkhani and Sardar Muhtesham Ilbegi of the Bakh- tiaris. The former, however, has been absent from the tribal country throughout the year, and his place has been filled by the Sardar Bahadur, son of Sardar Assad. The commencement of the year found the aoting Ilkhani and the Ilbegi en route to their country from Tehran, and they reached Malamir early in March to transact the usual tribal business in the low country. In May they returned to Malamir where rumours of trouble in their highlands necessitated their hurried return to Deh Kurd. The Chahar Lang highlanders (Mahmud Salehi) had risen against the Chiefs' authority and persuaded the Zargham-es-Sultaneh (Riza Kuli Khan branch) to place himself at their head promising that they would recognise him as their Chief in the event of their succeeding in throwing off the Bakhtiari Chiefs' authority and obtaining independence as a separate tribe. The Zargham was at Padumba and sent his son Ali Reza Khan to lead the rebellion. The malcontents under Ali Reza seized Feraidun, but at this juncture (30th May) the Ilbegi and acting Ilkhani reached the high country with a large force of sowars learning which Ali Reza Khan fled to his father. The Sardar Muhtesham then sent a small force to punish the Chahar Lang (Mahmud Salihi) and a skirmish took place on the 9th June at Pul-i-Zaman Khan in which the Sardar Muhtesham's followers suffered a reverse. A large Haftlang force was then collected and marched against the rebels from the Zaman Khan direction while a second Bakhtiari detachment with two guns was raised in Ispahan and directed against them from the east. The rebels, realizing that further resistance was useless, sent in their submission to the Khans and peace was made. In July, the news of the return of the ex-Shah to Persia was received, and the Ilkhani and Ilbegi were ordered to raise as large a force as possible and proceed to Tehran. They left the tribal territory in August and appointed Muntazim-ed-Dowleh and Salar-i-Ashraf acting Ilkhani and Ilbegi respectively during their absence. Thanks to the tribal territory being practically denuded of all tufangchis and arms, the remainder of the year passed quietly and there were no further inter-tribal quarrels of any sort within Bakhtiari territory. The marches and counter-marches of the Bakhtiari forces under their various chiefs and their engagements with the forces of the ex-Shah and Salar-ed-Dowleh hardly come within the purview of this Consulate.77 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The Bakhtiari appointments to Governorships were as follows Governor of Ispahan Governor of Kurdistan Governor of Kermanshah Governor of Behbehan Governor of Luristan . . . • • Governor of Kashan . . • • • Governor of Nahavaud, Daulatabad and Malayir .

Zaigham-es-Sultaneh . Sardar Arshad. Ilyas Khan . Sarum-ul-Mulk . • Muin-i- H amay un. Muhammad Reza Khan Muin Hamayun . Sardar Fateh. The changes in the Governorships of Behbehan have been mentioned under ' Local Authorities' and it u S1 ^ remains only to report the tribal changes and other events of interest which have taken place during the year. The Bahmai section of the tribe continued nominally under Bakhtiari rule, but it is doubtful if the Khans succeeded in collecting any revenue from the section for which, however, they are responsible to the Persian Govern ment. In July, Ali Nakki Khan, Chief of the Ahmedi sub-section of the Bahmai, was murdered by a servant at the instigation of his nephew—Darvish Khan. The latter took over the chieftainship of the sub-section and occupied the murdered man's fort at Likak. Husain Khan, Ali Nakki Khan's brother, immediately he heard of the murder, collected some followers and laid siege to the fort. Darvish Khan, after a few days' resistance, made terms with the besiegers who promised to allow him and his followers to return in safety to their homes. Immediately they left the fort, however, they were set upon by Husain Khan and treacher ously murdered. The chieftainship thus fell into the hands of Husain Khan who retained it till the close of the year. The other sections of the Kuhgilu tribe remained nominally under Behbehan and, through the Deputy-Governor of that place, under the Governor-Generalship of Shiraz, but no steps were taken to compel them to pay their revenue nor were any efforts made to prevent the Tebi section from raiding on the Bakhtiari road or the other sections from plundering the roads nearest to their territories. The beginning of the year found the Bakhtiari road open to traffic and Condition of Roads. lar ^ e quantities of goods passing back- , i p t i wards and forwards to Ispahan. In tne end ot J anuary heavy snow blocked the passes and traffic was interrupted tor a period of six weeks. On the road re-opening exceptionally large quan- 1 } es goods were forwarded from both ends, a record caravan of 1,200 animals leaving Ahwaz for Ispahan, on the 4th April. . In middle of May merchants at both ends experienced some difficulty m securing transport animals; muleteers and camelmen taking the oppor tunity to graze their animals on the abundance of ^rass and green food which(g) POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 78 of $ the exceptionally good rains had produced. In June, transport was so diffi cult to obtain and such quantities of goods intended for up-country had accumulated in the godowns of Ahwaz merchants that Messrs. Lynch Brothers warned shippers that they were unable to forward goods and advised them to cease shipping to Ahwaz for the time. In June Tebi raiding parties appeared near the road, and a week or two later a caravan was plundered at Laghamgir. Shortly afterwards the caravan serai at Shalil was raided and all goods lying there carried off or destroyed. When the news of these robberies became known traffic ceased completely and such goods as were lying at the various stages on the road were at the mercy of Tebi raiders or Bakhtiari tribesmen. Caravanserai after caravan serai was plundered and the acting Khans took no steps to prevent further rpbberies or punish the offenders—who, in many cases, were their own sub jects. In August, Messrs. Lynch's Ispahan Agent went to see the Khans at Chigakhor and persuaded them to provide him with an escort of 60 tufang- chis with whom he traversed the road to Ahwaz arriving early in October, It was arranged with the Khans that 250 other tufangchis should be sent down soon after him to picket the road. Shortly after the arrival of Lynch's Agent in Ahwaz, the cholera, which was raging in Arabistan, reached Malamir and all thought of guarding the road was abandoned. The road thus remained unguarded and closed to traffic until November when snow on the mountain passes closed the roads used by Kuhgilu raiders and ensured its safety. From this date until the close of the year traffic was resumed, and the accumulation of goods at both ends of the road considerably reduced. The losses of goods on the road through robberies is estimated at some £15,000 of which over £10,000 was the property of British subjects. The following table shows the goods forwarded over the Lynch Road and numbers of animals employed during the year under report as compared with the two preceding years :— Description.

The first was the absence of all the senior Khans from the Bakhtiari country during the greater part of the year, and the consequent relaxation of control over the tribesmen. The second cause was the calling out of all available tufangchis by the Khans for their military campaigns in Northern Persia, thus leaving the tribesmen helpless to resist Kuhgilu raids. The negotiations between Messrs. Lynch Brothers and the Bakhtiari Chiefs regarding the repairs to the Godar bridge were concluded towards the close of the year the Khans agreeing to pay the sum of Krans 60,000 for the work. Mr. Sotham and an assistant engineer arrived in Nasiri in November to collect the necessary workmen and material prior to proceeding to the bridge. Messrs.

Anglo -Persian Oil Company.—In the end of April negotiations were entered into with the Bakhtiari Chiefs for the acquisition of the land com prising the oil-fields at Masjid Suleman. The Company paid a sum of £22 000 for the 6,131 acres of land and thereby acquired complete rights over this tract of country, for the period of the Company's concessign (60 years). . The pipe-line from the oil-fields to Abadan was completed m June. In January, Mr. Willans was appointed Assistant Fields Manager under the orders of Mr. Ritchie who assumed the General Fields Managership and charge of the pipe-line. Mr. Capito relieved Mr. Willans as Assistant Fields Manager in October. The attitude of the Bakhtiari Khans and their tribesmen towards the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been most satisfactory during the year under review, no friction of any sort being experienced. Such small local disputes as arose have been settled by Doctor Young, the Company's Political Adviser, or on reference, by His Majesty's Consul. The Khans, at the close of the year, had taken no steps to provide other land for the tenants who formerly cultivated the Company's land. The rainfall for the year at Ahwaz amounted to 11*82 inches. The highest temperature recorded was 117 4, Miscellaneous. on g rc j j u |y 1911, and the lowest 31-8, on the 25th January 1911. The good rainfall produced an abundant supply of grain and fodder throughout the territories reported upon. A. GREY, Captain, LA., His Britannic Majesty's Consul j and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz. His Britannic Majesty's Consulate, Ahwaz ; The 15th March 1912.CHAPTER V1IL ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1911. Major A. P. Trevor, I.A., held charge of the Political Agency until the Personnel 19th April, when he proceeded home on long leave. He was relieved on that date by Major S. G. Knox, I.A., C.I.E., who continued to hold charge for the remainder of the year. Captain N. N. G. C. McVean, I.M.S., held charge of the post of Agency Surgeon throughout the year. Foreign Consuls, Monsieur A. Jeannier remained Con- sul for France throughout the year. Mr. John A. Ray held the post of American Consul until the 26th April when he left for America, handing over charge of the Consulate to his Deputy and Vice-Consul, Mr. Muhammad Fathil, who continued to hold charge until the 11th December when Mr. Homer Brett arrived at Maskat and relieved him. The Italian Government Agent, Mr. Umberto Omar, left Maskat on the 26th April and has not been replaced. The relations of His Britannic Majesty's Consul with his foreign collegues have remained most cordial throughout the year. In May, Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad-ar-Ruwaihi visited Sur, on behalf of the French Con sul; for the purpose of enumerating the French dhows there. Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Resident, in the Persian visits of Resident. arrived at Maskat in the E.I.M.S. Lawrence, on the 5th November, and remained until the 16th November. The main object of his visit was to discuss the Arms Traffic question with His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. Negotiations on this difficult subject advanced appreciably, and it is hoped that a definite arrangement for restricting the traffic to its legitimate dimen sions will not be long delayed. The 22nd of June being the Corona- tion day of His Imperial Majesty the ivmg-Emperor, George V, was cele brated with the usual celebrations that mark the King's Birthday. On the 12th December, a Durbar was held by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul in commemoration of the Imperial Durbar held by His Imperial Majesty the King-Emperor at Delhi. It was attended by about 260 persons of whom perhaps 33 per cent, were foreigners headed by Saiyid Nadir, second son of His Highness the Sultan, and the French and American Consuls. The Political Agent addressed the meeting explaining the object of the assembly and concluded by calling for three cheers, which were enthusiastically given, for Their Imperial Majesties. Saiyid Nadir then read out an address sent by His Highness the Sultan in which the latter expressed regret at his inability to be present owing to an accident, his sympathy with the object of the meeting and his earnest desire for the con tinuance and strengthening of the ancient bonds of friendship which united Great Britain and Maskat. The proceedings terminated by the presenta tion of His Imperial Majesty's portrait to Saiyid Nadir on behalf of the Sultan as a memento of the occasion. Royal salutes were fired by H. M. S. 'Philomel' and His Highness the Sultan's fort Jallali battery at noon. Various entertainments were given by influential British subjects, and buildings, both Government and private, were illuminated in the evening. H. M. S. ' Philomel' gave a display of fireworks and search-light effects which were much appreciated. The health of His Highness the Sultan has been good throughout the His Highness the Sultan and Family. Ff 11 '* ^ temporary indisposition, . Already alluded to in connection with the Coronation Durbar, was due to a sprained knee, the result of a M 281 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF fall from a camel; though severe, it is hoped that there will be no lasting result from it. The relations between His Highness and the Agency have been on the whole good, in spite of the Arms Traffic, and have improved con siderably of late in consequence of the opening of negotiations between His Highness and Government in connection with that problem. The year opened with the celebration of the marriages of Saiyids Nadir and Muhammad on New Year's Day. The Political Agent with a party of guests attended an entertainment given by Saiyid Taimur in honour of the occasion. Towards the end of January, the Political Agent presented to Saiyids Nadir and Muhammad the Resident's congratulations and presents on their marriage. Saiyid Taimur left Maskat on the 12th April by B. I. S. ' Kola ' on a trip to Basrah and Baghdad. He returned to Maskat on the 17th May. This visit called forth some anti-English utterances on the part of the local Turkish press at Basrah who endeavoured to make political capital out of a tourist visit. Saiyid Nadir paid a visit to Murair to settle troubles between the Muta rish and the Zaid in the month of September. He also left for Sur in the end of October on tribal work. Saiyid Taimur left Maskat for Karachi and Bombay on the 18th Novem ber to see the Royal reception of Their Imperial Majesties at Bombay. His Highness the Sultan remained at Maskat throughout the year until the 28th November when he left for Masnaa and Sib, leaving Saiyid Nadir to deal with all local Maskat business during his absence. Shaikh Salim bin Suleiman bin Suweilim, who figures under this head- Condition of Country. ^ ] in last ye a f s report, arrived ill Maskat on 30th January. He was summoned on account of various complaints urged against him by British subjects resident at Sohar. He returned to Sohar on the 8th April, and the rumour of his return was sufficient to cause trouble among the Beni Umar. The Wali managed to patch up a peace, but trouble broke out again between the Beni Umir and the Hawasineh supported by the Yal Saad early in May. The Hawasineh suffered severely. This Wali Salim bin Suleiman returned seriously ill to Maskat and died on the 5th June. He was replaced by his brother Mozafar. There was the usual crop of inter-tribal dsputes during the year in the Oman district, but the year began with a settlement effected between the Beni Jabir and A1 Ma'awal tribes by Shaikhs Saif bin Suleiman of Thau of the Beni Jabir and Shaikh Suleiman bin Nasir of the Al, Ma'awal. This settle ment was confirmed by His Highness the Sultan. The whole trouble was very nearly re-opened at Muttra by high-handed action on the part of a tribesman of Al Ma awal assisted by a negro slave of the Wali of Muttra, but fortunately the Wali and Shaikh Saif bin Suleiman were in time to avert what would probably have been a serious affray by enforcing prompt restitu tion to the Beni Jabir sufferers. y. In March, from Sur came news of trouble among the Beni Bu Hassan who attacked the tower of Jinah under Sur, but failed to take it. There was loss of life on both sides, but the Bedouins suffered severely. There was further serious fighting about the same time at Khaburah between the tribes of Hawasineh on the one side and Beni Khalid and Beni Zara on the other. The number of killed reached nearly 200, and His High ness sent Saiyid Badar bin Saif to make an enquiry and arrange terms of peace. On the 28th June, Shaikh Saif bin Suleiman of the Beni Jabir of Thau died ot acute rheumatism. ,, Ghalib bin Ali, His Highness's Wali of Gwadur, arrived at Maskat in the end of July and left again after a stay of about three weeks. mterview m October, His Highness informed the Political Agent that the Bern Bu Ah were faghting with the Bepi Bu Hassan and, at HisI POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 82 Highness's request, the Political Agent wrote warning British Indian sub jects trading in Sur and Ja'alan to keep away from the disturbed locality. The returns which usually accompany this report have been prepared this year and are attached as append ices. The most striking feature of these returns is the indication that, in spite of the blockade, the import trade in arms has recovered from the various blows dealt to it, the import figures for the year 1911 being back again to the import figures for 1909. Another sali ent point is that, during the past two years 1910 and 1911, German shipping has profited over British shipping to a greater extent than appeared in 1909, though even in that year, the greater part of the imported arms and ammuni tion was carried in German bottoms. The large Afghan trade via the Mekran Coast has undoubtedly suffered severely. Perhaps the most evident proof of this was the settlement arrived at between the leading Maskat arms trader, Ali Khan, and the principal Afghan gun-runners, in the month of November, which it is unnecessary to describe in detail here. It showed clearly that the principal Afghans were anxious to get out of the business. It seems clear that the principal activity in the arms trade has shifted up north and, if arms in any quantity are carried by sea at all after they leave Maskat, they must be looked for mainly west of Has Musandim and probably so far up as Katr and Kuwait. The answer to the problem ' what becomes of the arms?' has not, so far as the writer knows, been discovered, but it becomes at least worth considering whether it should not be looked for in Central Arabia and Turkey in Asia rather than in Persia and Afghanistan. r Jhe actual figures for the steamer trade of 1911 are:—in German bottoms, Rs. 10,50,360; in British bottoms, Rs. 5,12,770; total Rs. 15,63,130 as against last year's total of Rs. 6,20,550. Prices do not seem to have varied materially. A comparative statement for the years 1910 and 1911 will be found below. Statement showing ay^roxiraate prices at the end of 1911. A bms.

On the whole, Maskat public health has been good and, with the excep tion of an outbreak of plague in the month of April, fortunately not very severe, there are no epidemic diseases to report as having occurred in either Maskat or Muttra. The plague epidemic died down early in May and the port was given a clean bill of health on the 14th June. Very different accounts, however, came from the districts of Oman. Cholera was reported no less than five times during the year: in the end of January a severe epidemic carried off about 250 of the Beni Bu Hassan and 150 of the Beni Bu Ali tribes in Sur and Ja'alan. Among the victims of this epidemic were Shaikh Sultan, grandson of Amir Abdulla bin Salim of Ja'alan, and Shaikhs Rashid bin Hamad and Ali bin Jumaiah of the Beni Bu Ali. The outbreak was stated later to have spread to Sharquiyah and was reported very virulent at Rostak and Bidiyah. In July, cholera was again reported from Ja'alan among the Beni Hassan villages, and another slight outbreak of the disease was reported from Sur at the end of August. Small-pox was reported, in the beginning of February, from Falaj, and again in May from the Batina Coast where Shaikh Said bin Salim, His Highness the Sultan's Wali of Suwaiq, with his son fell a victim to the disease. His Highness was greatly attached to this official and felt his loss deeply. There was a slight recrudescense of plague in Sib and Kuryat in May when the disease had begun to die out in Maskat itself. Abdul Karim, a low class Poona Muhammadan, continued to manage Customs aud Landing Arrangements. Highness's Customs Department for mm. Ihe issue oi goods to consignees without production of delevery orders or bills of lading still continues and leads to many difficulties and some oppression. In the end of August, His Highness the Sultan at last got tired of the slack business methods of his landing contractor Abdul Kadir, and a parti cularly glaring theft by the latter's boatmen led to his downfall. For some time, the landing arrangements were conducted by the Customs Superinten dent Abdul Karim, and landing charges were immediately enhanced by 50 per cent. There is no doubt, however, that, in the past, they were too low to admit of profitable working without dishonesty. In the end of October His Highness permitted the landing arrangements to be undertaken by a com pany of four men of whom the leader is Ali Khan, the noted Baluch arms dealer. The other three are Zubair, a clerk of His Highness; Hamdan, an Arab subject and employ^ at the British Post Office; and Muhammad KathurL who was the late partner of the ex-landing contractor. Abdul Kadir, and enjoys an evil reputation. These appointments are a clear departure from time-honoured custom in Maskat whereby importers, of whom 75 per cent, are British Indian subjects, appoint their own agent subject to His High- ness s approval. But British subjects, consignees, have only themselves to thank for the loss of this privilege, as they are hopelessly divided among them selves and have only one object in view—the cutting down of landing rates. As soon as the natural result follows, badly paid employes and barefaced theft, they are full of complaint but cannot unite to put an end to the unsatis factory state of affairs. At present there is, so far as the Political Agent is aware, no landing contract of any kind, but, under the present arrangements, there has been a marked diminution of complaints and indeed it is difficult to imagine any arrangement that could be worse than that of Abdul Kadir. During the year under report 48 applications were received from slaves slave Trade. ^ or freedom, of whom 31 were from . Mekran and 17 from Zanzibar. Of the 48 applicants, 24 were freed and manumissions granted. Six more slaves, w ose cases were pending during 1910, were also freed during the year.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 84 His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief paid two visits during the year to Maskat. On the first occa- Royai Navy. g . on ^ . n ^ mont k 0 f j anU ary, official visits were exchanged between His Highness and His Excellency. His Excellency arrived again on the 3rd May but did not land owing to quarantine and left after a day's stay. All the other ships of the East Indies Squadron have been constantly in and out of the port in connection with the Arms Traffic operations. No foreign man-of-war visited Maskat Foreign Navy. during the year under report. The American Mission has been active throughout the year. Dr. Harri son's hospital at Muttra, in the begin- American Mission. ^ of ^ charged n0 fees and became therefore very popular. Miss mutton too opened a small dispensary in the Mission House at Maskat and paid frequent visits to the Sultan's harem and others, sometimes as a private visitor and sometimes as medical adviser. Dr. Harrison accompanied by Rahmat Uddin, a compounder, and an American colporteur left for the interior of Oman, on the 24th January. He was reported beyond Rostak in the beginninsr of April where cholera was prevalent, and he gave some medical relief to the sufferers. He returned, on the 3rd May, but almost immediately left Muttra for Kuwait and the Mission hospital at Muttra was closed for the summer until the arrival of Dr. Thoms, in October. On the 15th January, a heavy storm broke up 30 boats and one ' boom ' , „ . , „ on Muttra beach. Similar heavy eat er an am a . damage was reported from Gwadur where Haji Musa, brother of the Native Assistant, was killed by the collapse of his house. The rainfall for the year amounted to 3*98 inches. The hot weather was late in coming but the heat in June and July was intense. The heat in the latter month was also unduly prolonged, and Maskat did not feel the benefit of the monsoon until the beginning of August. The highest temperature recorded was 110 0° on the 21st June. The highest average day temperature was 101-6° in the month of July, and the highest average night temperature was 89-4° in the month of July. The lowest day temperature recorded was 69 0° on the 23rd January, and the lowest night temperature was 58-4° on 1st February. Tables of temperature and rainfall are appended. S. G. KNOX, Major, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. Maskat; / The 6th January 1912, MASKAT HOSPITAL. Note on the Maskat-Muttra Hospital by Captain N. N. G. C. McVean, M.B. y I.M.S., A gency Surgeon, Maskat. The Maskat-Muttra Hospital remained open for the treatment of patients throughout the year. It has now been in use for about fifteen months and is a great improvement on the old hospital. During the year under report over three thousand patients (including 150 in-patients) have been treated. Although excellent accommodation has been provided for in-patients, the numbers remain low as the natives do not take kindly to staying in hospital; few of them are able to make arrangements for their own food while in hospital, and the funds available for the main tenance of pauper patients are very small.85 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The European ward has been the most successful, and many naval patients have benefited from it. The number of patients treated by the Agency Surgeon has been gradu ally declining during recent years. The statistics of former years have shown as many as 5,000 patients as against the present year's figures of 3,000. This, no doubt, is almost entirely due to the institution of the American Mission dispensary at Muttra. Naturally all Muttra patients npw go there for treatment as well as many sick and wounded from the interior, as their road to Maskat lies through Muttra. Probably the number of persons in receipt of modern medical relief greatly exceeds the statistics of former years. Note on the epidemic of ylague which occurred in Maskat and neighbourhood during spring of 1911 by Captain N. N. G. C. McVean, M.B, I.M.S., A gency Surgeon, Maskat. The first case of plague appeared on the 4th March 1911 among some pilgrims in the quarantine station who had arrived on the 27th of February 1911 in a pilgrim ship; no case had appeared during the voyage of some ten days from Jeddah. This case was a very mild one. On the 15th of March 1911, a second case, that of a sepoy on duty, occurred in quarantine; this case died the same day. On the 30th March, a few cases were discovered at Sidab, a village about half a mile from the quarantine station and about a mile and a half from Maskat; the disease had probably existed only for a few days previously there; Sidab was isolated and all communication with Maskat stopped. About this time, it was reported that rats were dying in Maskat, very few were seen and these showed no signs of plague; however, a case of bubonic plague occurred in Maskat, on the 6th April, followed by a second on the 11th April; after that cases became more frequent and there were a few also in Muttra; the epidemic continued till the 20th May, the number of cases decreasing as the weather got hotter. In all 76 cases with 67 deaths were reported; it was very difficult to get accurate information as the natives objected to notifying cases; the majority of cases were not reported till after QGQXjlL However, it is improbable that there were many more cases, as a watch was kept on the number of deaths occurring. Most of the cases were of bubonic plague, but there were also a good many cases of septicsemic plague. The inhabitants of Maskat were advised to take the usual precautions, imple Jules were framed and translated into the different languages spoken ere. About seventy-five people were inoculated with anti-plague serum; no cases occurred among the inoculated so far as is known, but most of the inoculating was done at a rather late period of the epidemic as at first there was a general belief that the epidemic would soon be over.I POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 90 * In every case the arms were ingeniously hidden; in the case of ' Philomel's capture, the arms were actually built in between the deck and a false deck; in the two 'booms' captured by ' Fox,' the arms were built into the bottom of the vessels; in the ' Bedan ' captured by Tamil they were built on outside the hull on each side of the keel. This extreme care has been brought about by the untiring vigilance of His Majesty s ships and launches employed in the suppression of the Arms Traffic and, besides the actual loss by capture, has added a great deal to the prices now asked by arms runners. The high percentage of modern weapons suggests that those of obsolete types are probably not remunerative enough to be worth the trouble of running.CHAPTER IX. ADMINISTRATION REPOET FOR THE TRUCIAL COAST FOR THE YEAR 1911. As was the case last year, the relations of the several ruling Shaikhs inter se, and with the Bedouins of the immediate interior, were generally- speaking satisfactory, and, except in one instance, gave the Residency no cause for intervention. On the other hand, the larger problems connected with these principalities, such as the pearl-trade; the relations of the Shaikhs with the British Government; and the unenviable notoriety which their coast is earning as a base for the smuggling of arms to Katr and Persia, afforded no little material for anxiety and correspondence. It will be con venient to revert to these questions after disposing of the more simple items of the record. Shaikh Salim bin Sultan has continued in the Shaikhdom and his rela- , ^ . tions with his nephew, the Shaikh of Ras-el-Kheima. | * « tj *, bhargah, have not been brought into issue. The Shaikh of Rams, an appanage of Ras-el-Kheima, lying , little to the east of it, got himself into trouble for conniving at the shipment of arms from his village, in spite of specific remonstrances from Shaikh Salim and the Residency Agent, and was accordingly fined Rs. 2,000 under threat of having his village demolished by H. M. S. ' Fox.' Shaikh Rashid's behaviour has been satisfactory and so far his limits Umm-el-Kowein. ^ ^ at a11 in the re P 0rts of Arms Iramc informers. Shaikh Homeid, since his accession, has given a good deal of trouble to A . inan the Residency, less perhaps from motivs than from ignorance and the tendencies of his rough and quarrelsome disposition. Thus, in July, the Senior Naval Officer, having been instructed by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- Chief to examine the approaches to Zora, (the strip of coast separating Hamriyah and Ajman, which is under consideration as a site for a wireless installation), H. M. S. ' Fox' anchored off the locality for the survey of the Khor, and the Captain prepared to erect some bench marks and a tide pole in order to carry out his observations. Had the services of the Residency Agent been first employed to explain matters to the Shaikh, diffi culties would probably have been obviated, but not having been so prepared and being the character that he is. Shaikh Homeid refused to allow the ship's party to put up any marks and declined to come off to H. M. S. ' Fox ' to interview the Captain. Subsequently, the Residency Agent having been summoned. Shaikh Homeid was induced by him to visit Captain Tancred and apologise, and to allow the tide pole and marks to be erected; three days later, however, before the ship's work was finished, the Shaikh sent off to say that they must be removed at once as his people were excited. The populace at this time were said to be running about armed and restless, but the work was finished and the flags removed without mishap. With the recollection of H. M. S. ' Hyacinth's ' incident fresh in memory, and in view of this further experi ence, His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, at the request of the Resident, issued General Orders to the Squadron enjoining extreme caution in carrying out such duties as the above in the Gulf, and the necessity of consulting the Political Officers concerned before taking action. Shaikh Homeid's behaviour was also unsatisfactory in other directions. He had several times to be remonstrated with for failing to act up to his obligations to his brother Shaikhs under the rules regulating the treatment of runaway divers from other principalities. In this direction his conduct was especially objectionable in that he encouraged the troublesome ' Bin98 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Lutas' (see last year's report) who had transferred their domicile from Debai to Ajman, in enticing away divers from Debai. Later in the year he ceased to pay attention to friendly remonstrance, and even proceeded to ignore the Residency Agent's communications, and on the Resident's arrival at Maskat from India, in March, reports which reached him from the Resi dency Agent made it evident that Shaikh Homeid needed to be brought to his bearings without delay. A visit was, therefore, paid to Ajman in the R. I. M, S. u Lawrence ' en route to Bushire. The Shaikh was ordered on board and called upon to show cause why he should not be fined under the Diving Code. For some time he maintained a demeanour of bluff and antagonism, but eventually gave it up and expressed contrition; paid the fine of Rs. 2,500 imposed upon him, and promised to turn over a new leaf. It will be interesting to see how he shapes when the projected wireless station is installed at Zora, a project which will need cautious handling. Relations with Shaikh Sagar have been satisfactory, and he has been tractable in connection with Abu Musa Shargah ' affairs and such other business matters as have had to be transacted with him. Unfortunately the epidemic of plague, which visited Debai so heavily at the commencement of the hot weather, spread to his port, and it is believed that 400 or 500 deaths occurred during the outbreak. The Abu Musa dispute with the German Government pursued the tedious tenour of its way during the year and was still unconcluded at the end of it. In May, the Resident submitted his reply to the German rejoinder and this was forwarded with the endorsement of the Government of India to His Majesty's Government. It is understood to have been communicated to the German Government in December accompanied by a memorandum proposing settlement by a compromise, the effect of which would be, while safeguarding the Shaikh's rights, to restore Messrs. Wonckhaus, as far as possible, to the commercial position occupied by them at the moment when their operations were stopped by the Shaikh of Shargah's action. There the matter stood at the end of the year. Meanwhile, in order to convince the German Govern ment that we were ready to meet them in any reasonable way. His Majesty's Government acceded to a request from the latter that Messrs. Wonckhaus should be permitted to remove more of the oxide already mined, with the proviso, however, that the time limit of December 1912 should be placed upon their operations. Except for the connection of the principality and others with the Arma Abu Dhabi. Traffic, which will be dealt with sepa rately, the affairs of Abu Dhabi have not been in evidence, and the behaviour of the Shaikh has been satisfactory. The following development has taken place during the year, in connec tion with the time-honoured Taona Piracy Case. The pirate ' Gaithoo, 5, whose capture was chronicled in the Administration Report for 1909 .(page 67), was detained in custody at Bahrain through two pearling seasons in the hope that the repeated endeavours of His Majesty's ships and Political Officers to capture his two brothers would be successful, and that it would be possible to arraign the three brothers together. All efforts, however, proved abortive, and as Gaithoo s conduct, during a confinement of over two years, nad been exemplary, and it appeared difficult to continue it indefinitely, it was decided, in October, in communication with the Government of India and His Majesty s Minister at Tehran, that he should be released and that we must content ourselves with the hope of eventually making good the claim for pecuniary compensation against the Persian Government. Debai It is convenient to take up the thread of Debai affairs from where it was left by the Report of 1910. The feud between the Shaikh and the Bin Luta family seems to die The Bin Luta Family. hard and has continued to be a source of . . , , inconvenience and friction during the year. An interesting coincidence in connection with this case is noticed.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 94 It will be seen in last year's narrative that the Shaikh of Debai's cousin Maktum, after his fatal affray with Muhammad bin Nasir bin Luta, took refuge in the house of one Ahmed bin Dalmuk, a near kinsman of the Shaikh of Debai by marriage. It will also be seen in the same report that the house of Ahmad bin Dalmuk was one of those reported by informers to the Captain of H. M. S. 44 Hyacinth ' as having a store of smuggled arms, and that it was on his proceeding to search this house that his party was fired at. Now one of the persons from whom the Flag Captain's information regarding the presence of arms was obtained was Ahmad bin Luta. This may be only a coincidence; on the other hand it is by no means impossible that the information was laid by the Bin Lutas by way of ' getting their own back.' During the hot weather of 1911, the family inadvisedly and against the specific counsel of the Resident transferred their domicile to Ajman. This in itself made it evident to the Shaikh of Debai that the Bin Lutas had not really buried the hatchet. On arrival at Ajman they commenced intriguing, by employing them selves, or encouraging the Shaikh of Ajman to employ, runaway divers from Debai, a proceeding invariably leading to trouble on the Trucial Coast. They also seem to have been instrumental in sowing seeds of ill-feeling be tween the Chief of Ajman and the Residency Agent, and matters had arrived at a pass which called for prompt treatment when the Resident returned to the Gulf after absence at the Delhi Durbar. The action taken would pro perly fall within next year's report, but to complete the narrative it may be mentioned that the two brothers were heavily fined and obliged to deposit a further sum as security for good behaviour, and appear, for the present at all events, to have been thereby reduced to a tractable demeanour. It is a matter for great regret that plague seems to have come to stay in the Gulf. A verv severe epidemic plague • occurred on the Trucial Coast during the spring and hot weather of the year under report, commencing at Debai and extending to Shargah, and probably to an inconsiderable extent to neighbour ing villages also. The inhabitants themselves attribute the visitation specifically to the intercourse now prevailing between Debai and India by British India steamers; and specially to the arrival of large cargoes of rice m May and June. Owing to the slowness of letter communication and the ignorance of the inhabitants, the disease must have been prevalent for some time before it was diagnosed, owins to some plague-stricken passengers arriving at LmgaH from Debai. Once it got a hold, the disease appears to have spread very r'inidiv and though the circumstances made it difficult to frame any reii- able figures, the Eesidency Agent and the Shaikh of ^ ebal ®^P re °? inl0 T ' that not less than 2,000 persons died m Debai and about 500 m Shargah. It appears to have dted out as suddenly as it came, and by August the towns were said to be quite clear. It is realised that the appearance of plague at Debai, now a regular nort of steamer call, engages the responsibility of the Government of India Fn the matter of medical supervision of the Trucial Coast; a somewhat diffi cult problem, which occupies their lively attention. There being some tangible grounds to apprehend that European pearl merchants, stimulated by the consider- pearl fisheries. able success which has attended their ( „««e r e r s of EuropeanS t0 8et a operations in the direction of pearl (2) Reported depletion of pearl banks. buying in the Gulf Ports, might attempt to enter still further into the local industry by inveigling unsophisticated native Rulers into giving them fishing concessions, the Eesident was author- fsed to explain to the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast, Bahrain and Kuwait how greatly it would be to the prejudice of their own interests to grant suen95 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF concessions and to obtain assurances in writing that they would not do These assurances were duly secured and recorded. sa A belief, resulting from reports of local pearl divers, having obtainpH currency to the effect that the practice of selling the oyster shells on shor which has prevailed during the past decade owing to the trade in mother-o'' pearl with Europe, and has replaced the time-honoured practice of returning the rejected shells to the deep after examination, was resulting in the deole tion of the banks, the Government of India were urged to consider the exped' ency of deputing an expert to investigate the question scientifically. Th proposal was approved in principle but abandoned for the present after some discussion, chiefly on account of the difficulty of charging the cost to Indian revenues. It is hoped, however, that the project, which is of the highest importance to the welfare of the pearling industry, will ultimately take shape. ^ Although, curious to relate, not a single Trucial Coast dhow has been Arms Traffic. captured by His Majesty's ships, carry- rp • ^ , . ln g smuggled arms, and although the 1 rucial Shaikhs themselves persistently deny that there is any illicit export of arms from their ports; yet the Arms Traffic reports from informers and other sources place it beyond doubt that a regular stream of arms and ammuni tion is passing from Sohar through Baraimi to the coast between Raa Musandim and Abu Dhabi, and that from this coast the bulk of the contra band finds its way through the shallows to the westwards, to A1 Bida, and Perskn^oast ^ orms a convenient jumping off place for the The attitude of the Shaikhs in regard to this traffic is rather one of apathy resulting from incompetence and apprehension, than of active com- plicity. it must be remembered that they have no levies or troops and that f S m c ; a] l do t0 P reserve order within the four walls of their own towns, and defend those towns against Bedouin attack. tlle T 611 0r eight sma11 towns on the littoral of the Trucial qi i s ln t ervene long stretches of uninhabited coast line over which the C f n ex + erci 1 se 110 supervision by sea or control by land, and it is from shipped 611 S ^ ) a l on g tins barren coast that rendezvous are made and arms p«rm JA 6 f 1611 an jJ 1 animals ' however, that bring these consignments to the coast ^r tll0Ut wat . era ^ supples, for which they presumably proceed theorptipJllv in f Ileare f t habited spot.

They were found to hail from the Tangistani villages under Baraki a few miles east of Bushire. The Governor of Bushire whose co-operation was asked, as usual, repudiated responsibility on the ground that this part of the coast was under the Governor-General of Fars. The latter on being applied to, pretended to take action but did nothing. The ' Lawrence went out immediately to cruise in the hope of cutting them off, but withqut success. Later the question got bound up with the problem of the action to be taken by the Persian Government to punish the community on the Shiraz road responsible for the attack on Consul Smart, and in conjunction with this question was in abeyance at the close of the year. The 400 odd rifles and ammunition captured were handed over by the Shaikh and destroyed under the orders of Government, the sum of Rs. 2,000 being sanctioned for presentation to the Shaikh in recognition of his action. It is recognised that in thus seizing the arms from the Tangistanis, Shaikh Butti acted creditably and in the interests of the British and Persian Gov ernments, and that no effort should be neglected to ensure that this piracy, costing the lives of eight of his subjects, which was the immediate result of it, shall be visited with just retribution. In other matters. Shaikh Butti r s conduct and regime was difficult and unsatisfactory. The ' Hyacinth ' incident of December 1910 is not only not forgotten, but is brought up at every turn as a justification for a retrograde and anti-foreign attitude in all matters of administration. Thus the Shaikh pretends that owing to the ill-feeling then engendered, his dependents will not tolerate any improvement in the postal arrangements; that he cannot guarantee the safety of Europeans landing at his port, etc., etc. There is no hond fides about these pretensions, but short of the deposi tion of the present Shaikh and his replacement by a more satisfactory Ruler, no speedy remedy suggests itself, other than the institution of specific measures by Government for strengthening our practical control and defining our jurisdiction over the Trucial Coast generally. An opportunity for such consolidation will, it is hoped, be found in the , _ n x• . „ project under contemplation for includ- Wireless Installation at Zora.

Knox, C.I.E., IA up to The Political Agency. ^e handed over to ' Captain D. L. E. Lonmer, I.A. From April to November attempt was made to carry on the office with only one English clerk, but this experiment failed. For some time gratuit ous assistance was given in the Vernacular Office by Agha Ali of Lingah, Throughout the year the deficiency of the staff in both the English and Verna cular Offices was constantly felt. Considerable difficulty has also been experienced in obtaining a regular supply of local and mainland news. The staff have little time and few facilities for this work. Khan Sahib Haji Abbas is now too old to be of much use; Yusuf Kanoo used to be the chief supplier of information, but it was found necessary to restrict the scope of bis services. This he resented, and it has not been possible to reject his offices in general and retain them in one particular. His loyalty to the Agency has recently been more than dubious, and his animosity to certain members of it marked. In consideration of his past services to Government through a long series of years, he was granted, as a Coronation honour, thfe Kaisar-i-Hind medal of the 2nd class. The building of house accommodation for the clerical staff, and major repairs and alterations in the Agency, are matters which will have to be seriously considered in the near future. The sepoy guard was twice relieved during the year, once in April and again in December. The present guard is composed of Hindu Rajputs, a fact which is likely to prove a source of much inconvenience. There was no change in the general character of the work which the Agency was called upon to perform. No new foreign interests made their appearance, nor did any existing ones disappear. The communities whose welfare is in the charge of the Agency are British, , British Indian, German, American, Persian, Turkish (Jews and Christians), Non-Bahrain Arab.

That amity has con tinued to subsist, is less due to any tact on the part of the Political Agent than to Shaikh Isa's lack of all fighting-spirit and his readiness on the ^lightest provocation to offer the other cheek. In September, Shaikh Isa informed the Political Agent that his cousin Shaikh Khali f ah bin Hamad bin shaikh isa and his Re ations. Muhammad had suddenly left Bahrain with the intention of invoking the assistance of the Turks in ' recovering ' his father's property from Shaikh Isa. It was subsequently reported by the Political Resident at Baghdad that Khalifah had passed through that town on his way to Constantinople. As this was not the first occasion on which this family had displayed hostility to the Ruling Power, Shaikh Isa was informed that if he saw fit to take steps in reason to establish control over Shaikh Hamad-bin-Muham- mad and his property, he would have our moral support. As in most matters he preferred to let things slide. Shaikh Isa on two occasions produced letters which had been addressed him by the Wali of Basrah. The first Shaikh Isa and the Wali of Basrah. ^ ^ alleged detention of the Hasa mails in the Bahrain quarantine. To this no reply was made. The second asked for the extradition of a Basrah criminal who was supposed to have absconded to Bahrain. With the Political Agent's approval, the Shaikh replied to this that the man had not come to Bahrain. This was believed to be the truth. Consequent on the agreement arrived at in 1910 between His Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah and the Shaikh etatns of Bahrania in Mohammerah. of Mohammerah regarding the protec tion by the British Government, of Bahrain subjects residing in the Shaikh's territory, some doubtful cases of title to protection had to be discussed. Under the terms of the agreement, only Bahranis who have settled in Arabistan since the accession of Shaikh Sir Khaz'al Khan are entitled to protection. There are probably in fact very few persons falling under this description, and Shaikh Isa, even if he were not misinformed by those interested, would probably be disinclined to recognise the test as satisfactory. No case has, however, as yet become a subject of serious dispute. Early in the year it came to light that the Bahrain Customs were issuing certificates for goods shipped from Tbe Katif Cn 8 tom.. Bahrain to Katif. It was stated that if such certificates were not produced before the Turkish officials, 22 per cent, ad valorem dues were exacted by them instead of 11 per cent,gg ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Shaikh Isa was informed and asked to make enquiries. He at stopped the issue of the certificates, probably without enquiry. From subsequent investigations it appeared that in no case was 22 Der cent, charged, but that the Bahrain certificates enabled goods of genuine Bahrain origin (chiefly lucerne seed) to be imported into Turkish territory free of duty. As this pointed to an assumption on the part of the Turks that Bahrain was a Turkish Province, Shaikh Isa was again informed and advised to maintain his prohibition of the issue of certificates. This he promised to do. At no time has the matter come up in a practical form, i.e., as a subiect of complaint or petition on the part of traders or boatmen. According to all reports received, no Turkish garrison has been stationed Zakhnuniyah. ° n ft 6 firing the year. The Dosins there at the end of the year were on occasions hoisting Shaikh Isa's flag, otherwise no flag was being flown. At the instance of His Britannic Majesty's Political Resident, Shaikh Foreign Poet Offices. ^ Sa 'J VaS invited to subscribe to an agree ment, not to permit any Foreign Gov ernment to establish a Post Office in Bahrain. Should any Power press for permission, we should then be in a position to support him. The Shaikh could not be induced to give such an undertaking, but he promised (in a letter dated 4th September 1911) that should any such proposal be made, he would say that he had so pledged himself, and would at once inform and consult us. In the middle of July, Shaikh Mubarak-bin-Sabah, Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubarak'e visit. paid a few days visit to Bahrain, and Q , i t m. „ was received as a distinguished guest by fenaikh Isa. The motive of the visit was probably to coax back into his fold is errant subject Hillal-al-Mutairi. At any rate he accomplished this.

Goods on board the mail steamers and in the Customs were over hauled, and boats and houses were examined. In no case, however, were these efforts rewarded with success. Such enquiries have been made as were possible with the staff and means available. Their results point to the probability of there being little dealing in arms actually in Bahrain itself. It is believed, however, that several local merchants of high standing are interested in the trade, and it is more than probable that there are often boats in the harbour which are engaged in it. The active centre of the trade is beyond all question Katr and in particular Dohah, where the import by land and sea from Maskat, and the export to the Persian Coast ana to Hasa, are extremely active. During the year 24 slaves were manumitted by the Agency after due Manumission of siavee. Several were refugees from Debai and Abu Dhabi. In two bad cases of recent purchase and importation by a couple of Bahrain subjects, Rashid-bin-Muhanna and Muhanna-bin-Fadhal, Shaikh Isa, on the recommendation of the Resident, exacted a fine of Rs. 500 from each of the masters. In autumn a case occurred in which one Isa-bin-Ahmed, Dosiri, had an ex-slave, who held a manumission certificate from the Agency, imprisoned by the Amir of Muharraq with the knowledge of Shaikh Hamad-bin-Isa. The case was at once taken up by the Agency and all parties pleaded ignor ance. The excuse would not hold as regards Isa-bin-Ahmed as the manu mission certificate had been issued by Major Prideaux in 1906 with his knowledge. Sheikh Isa has issued to the ex-slave, who is a diver, a 4 Barwa Khalawi,' or ' quittance of all indebtedness to his employer,' but he is being further pressed to impose some definite punishment on the offending Nakhuda, who has declined to tender to the Political Agent a formal apology of any sort. Some difficulty was experienced with other members of Dosiri clan in regard to a female soi-disant slave, which was solved after due delay by the issue of a manumission certificate. During the second half of the year there was a strong movement initiated, ts , • t , j m. ^ or at least headed, by Shaikh Kasim, Foreign Bad Characters. , , . ' the Chief Kazi, to put down immoral form of life in Bahrain. There are said to be a large number of houses of ill-fame, which are alleged, probably with truth, to serve the subsidiary pur pose of providing rendezvous for thieves and bad characters, and places for the deposit and resetting of stolen property. It is admitted that Bahrain subjects, and in particular the Shaikh's entourage, are interested in these or similar concerns, but public opinion and the self-righteous Kazi appeal in vain to Shaikh Isa's apathy or inertia. Accordingly strenuous efforts have been made to attack only the foreign^ ers, and the Political Agent has been obsessed by the Kazi, who will only talk in general terms. The Political Agent has expressed his entire readi ness to take such measures as are advisable, preferably deportation, in any case where reasonable proof of evil living is brought against any particular foreigner. Reference should properly be made by the Bahrain Government, but complaints of private individuals who were in any way sufferers by their neighbours' misconduct would be investigated. Only one such suit was filed, and it was immediately settled out of Court. The Political Agent also expressed his readiness at any time to discuss with the Ruler measures to be enforced equally on foreigners and native Bahrainis. He has also deported many foreigners who have been convicted of theft or have been unable to show any probability that they were earning an honest livelihood. The same old generalities and vague expostulations are still voiced by the Kazi, but the movement is subsiding. It was probably designed as a means of bringing the influence of the Agency to bear on Shaikh Isa, and was fostered by individuals who would like to have seen these two authorities at^ administration loseer-heads, and the Agency committing itsclf to arbitrary action which would have offended public feeling. It tailed through the radical inability of the Bahraini to bring any question on to a practical basis, and to substitute ascertained facts for vague assertions. In November, however, things took a more practical turn. Some one at last eained Shaikh Isa's ear and he suddenly issued orders to the Amit of Manama to turn the occupants out of about 30 houses in the town. This was nromptly executed, but it did not at once come to the ears of the Agency as the evicted though many of them foreigners, thought that the Agency must have been consulted and have given its approval. After ascertaining the facts the matter was taken to Shaikh Isa who defended his action by saying that the landlords of the houses were his own subjects. This was not entirely true, and in any case did not affect the question of tenants. Shaikh Isa was accordingly required at once to re-open the shops and reinstate the tenants after which any evidence of evil-living on the part of any of them would, if submitted to the Agency, receive attention. The Shaikh yielded with a good grace and the tenants were reinstated. No charges have been brought against them up to the time of writing, and in one or two cases which were investigated when the matter first cropped up, the people appeared to be harmless and well-conducted. It is undeniable that there is much suppressable crime in Bahrain, due in part to the riff-raff which the pearling industry attracts to the place, but chiefly to the inefficiency of the local Administration. As there is no material from which to draw Police or officials, and no financial system, the reforin of the administration is a very remote hope. Recent history in Turkey, Persia, India and Egypt, and more especially the record of it in the Native Press, has, Arab Feeling in Bahrain. ^ ^ Bahrain ag elsewhere, stimulated much frothy thought and imagination. The old Arab conceit and vainglory suffers nothing apparently from a dilution of the old Arab blood. The Bahrain Arab now dreams of a strong and independent Arab federation, and is proportionately impatient of foreign influence. The unpopularity of the European management of the cargo-landing business in Bahrain at the beginning of the year, and the substitution for it of garely Arab control, was undoubtedly a practical expression of these sentiments. It has cost both Arabs and foreigners pretty dear. The same spirit has seen in the Debai incident an eminent triumph of Arab firmness and diplomacy against the foreign arch-meddler, Great Britain Britain was determined to establish herself in Debai as in Bahrain, but she thought better of her scheme in presence of the masterly firmness of the Shaikh, who would have none of it. This ^ w patriotic ^ spirit, however, fluctuates in accordance with the temporal interests of the moment, and in no single individual is it very deep or very genuine. It is as a sort of popular catchword which keeps alive the idea of difference and opposition of interests and can be employed by the unscrupulous to create distrust, that it is a force. Latterly Muslim versus Christian feeling has been further excited by the events of the Turco-Italian War as recounted by the Native Press and ton stantinople telegrams. The war is of course regarded as purely an i Islamic. Persian affairs are also being watched with interest. The Persians are of course those most exercised in mind, but the Arabs were ready with stori of the landing of the Indian troops having been resisted at Bushire, ana ; would have been gratified by any British reverse. They have no sympaW with Persia or the Persians. , J n n s Pi te ^ a N this anti-European and anti-Christian feeling, the haft of the Bahranis appear to be friendly enough to the Agency. Some NaM» das bear a grudge on account of pearl cases, but public opinion is ' T\ onl .y .generally hostile feeling in the island is, I think', tobe soug', 6 sir is, with whom there is frequent trouble over the 1 ue jU pearling accounts and slaves. They are not readily amenable to ShaisPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 102 Isa's authority, which he is in consequence rather chary of exercising. There will probably be serious trouble with them some day. There is always an underlying feeling of dislike and distrust between the local Arabs and the Persian settlers, but it did not become acute at any time during the year. The death of a Persian boy by a shooting accident in the house of one of the minor Shaikhs was resented and noisily proclaimed as murder, by the mother. There was excellent evidence to prove that the boy accidentally shot himself, but some anxiety was aroused. All that was possible was done to relieve it and the incident had no untoward sequel. The usual signs of the absence of an effective Administration have been in evidence throughout the year in tne Hasa and Katif. Province of Hasa. From the outsiders' point of view, the most significant is the chronic insecurity of the Okair-Hasa trade route, which reacts on the trade of Bahrain. Considerable activity was diplayed in various directions by the lurkish authorities. A Customs import duty of 11 per cent. ^posed on soods of non-Turkish origin, and it is understood that it is being collected. A proposal to take a census aroused strong local resentment, and appears to have been dropped. A proposal to impose a duty on pearls at Katit was also abandoned. . At one time it was stated that a big fort was to be constructed at Okair. A detachment of troops was posted at 'Awamiyah, and the fort at Anik was repaired. Local subscriptions were raised in spring for the Turkish fleet, and m winter for the Turco-Italian War. i m i • u Negotiations were carried on throughout the year between the Turkis authorities at Katif and Hasa, and the Al-bu- Ainam at Kasr-as-Sub^aih and there is little doubt that the Turks intend to assert their claims to jurisdic tion over the place by posting a garrison and planting their nag. A new Mutassarif took over charge of Hasa in June, but rumoured tours by him to Katif, Kasr -as-Subaih and Katr have not yet taken place. In the first half of the year, Abdul Az iz-Ita T S a 'ud made h i raself a source of trouble and anxiety to the townspeople of Hasa (Hofuf) He was in the pursuit of property robbed by the A3man residing at Raqaiqah. He was eventually satLfied and took his departure. Earlier in the year he had threatened Katif. rn. -i i. tt- • Katr did not add much to its history during the year. Sheikh Kasim- bin-Thani is still the Supreme Ruler, but Katr - at Dohah, the only important town and port, he is represented by his fourth son Abdullah. The policy of excluding foreigners from Katr has been strictly main tained Two cases are known to have occurred in which foreign visitors were expelled, and even in Dohah there are said to be no foreign traders. The presence of Turkish troops at the latter place is, however, still toler ated. Towards the end of the year, the garrison was stated to be 58 soldiers, two Dhabits, one gunner and two guns. Investigations made during the year confirmed the fax)t that Katr is the centre of a very large arms traffic (see above). Apart from the wholesale trade, rifles are said to be more or less openly on sale m some dozen and bait shops in the Dohah bazaar. In October, Shaikh Kasim and his son Abdullah were invited by His Britannic Maiesty's Political Eesident to enter into an agreement with the British Government similar to that of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait to put down the trade. But they declined, asserting that there was no necessity as the trade did not exist in Katr. The Political Agent paid a visit to Katr in September and met, and was well received by. Shaikh Kasim at Lusail, and fehaikh Abdullah at Dohah. The migration of the Al-bu-'Ali clan from Dohah to Darin has already been mentioned above.103 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF A table of the cases dealt with by the Agency during the year is appended Jud . cial to this report. Mere numbers are, how- u lcia ' ever^ in themselves no certam criterion of the amount of work entailed. The heavy mortality due to plague placed a large number of estates m the hands of the Agency. This type of case provides much work and is very troublesome. The cases are investigated by the Medjliss-ul-'Urf and that body, which at best meets only once a week, is quite unequal to their rapid despatch. None of the more important of these cases, which date from May and onwards, have yet been concluded. An attempt was made to increase temporarily the membership of the Medjliss in order to enable it to supply two benches, but the gentlemen who were invited to join it declined the honour. The circumstances of this representative institution, which is in many ways deserving of respect, are not altogether happy. The members are all busy merchants and it is often difficult to get sufficient of them to attend. This leads to great delay of work, and some waste of the time of the Agency staff. The Agency is also much inconvenienced in its work by the inefficiency of the local Administration. In particular the incompetence and slackness of the Amir of Manama are distressing to a degree. This old dotard is beyond all hope of, or capacity for, cure, but a substitute would not easily be found. Defendants and witnesses are normally not presented, and the one intelligent Fidawi which each Amir has, is frequently not in attendance owing to illness or some such reason. It is difficult even to get an answer to a letter out of the Amir of Manama. All this makes the court work very burden some. Systematic bullying and reporting might have some effect, but there is no time for this. It is hoped sometime to take up the question seriously and pursue it to some bitter end with Shaikh Isa. The important case of the Katr debtor, Nasir-bin-Shahin-ul-Tuwar, was eventually settled through a series of compromises by which the creditors received in the end about 10 per cent, of their dues. He had been arrested in February 1911 and was released in June 1911. No Katr debtor now ever offers to pay more than 25 per cent, of his debts, following the example set by Shaikh Kasim-bin-Thani who, in 1909, got rid of his debts by 16 per cent, payments. The keen interest shown last year by Major Knox in enforcing the divers* Pearl Cases. rights seems to have borne some fruit. Nakhudas are said to have been more careful in keeping their accounts and more just in settling with their employes, and the number of suits filed since the close of the season is not as yet very large. The prosperous nature of the season had no doubt some effect in making the Nakhudas more generous. The division of the pearling season into two sections, with a recess during Ramzan, brought a large crop of suits into the Agency Court during that month. It was assumed, however, that final accounts could only be legally called for at the end of the season; so in the majority of cases efforts were confined to obtaining payment of subsistence allowance to the divers, and claims for final adjustment were dismissed. In the cases now pending, the old difficulties are still encountered, viz. (i) The unsatisfactory arrangement for supplying a Salifa Court. (ii) The general unwillingness of the Nakhudas to produce their accounts. In March, Shaikh Isa personally promised the Political Resident to reform the Salifa, and he lost no time in taking destructive measures, for Bu-Kais, the unsatisfactory Judge, was very soon removed. Constructive and reconstructive measures are, however, what the Shaikh fails in, and it defied all his ingenuity and resources to elevate any one to Humpty Dumpty's vacated seat.^ In May, he appointed a temporary Board of which the com position was irreproachable,^ but which proved highly illusive, and eventually vanished entirely out of existence. His promises were kept .conscientiouslypolitical residency for 1911. 104 before his unwilling eyes all through the hot weather and autumn; but he refused to declare his mind and conhned himself to making solemn promises, which suggested that he was working up for a brilliant theatrical coup at the eleventh hour. This suggestion was unhappily belied. Some time after the return of the pearlers, and on very urgent represent ations from the Agency, he at last made an appointment—it is said a very late'k g 00( i appointment—but that was not put to the proof as the gentleman never made an appearance and has now resigned. The commission has been since passed on to his brother, but he too has so far remained an abstraction. The result is that all the Agency pearling cases in which compromise could not be arrived at, have had perforce to be referred to the Shara' Court. The question of accounts is at present being fought out in two cases. In one, the plaintiff is a Dosiri Nakhuda. He made no objection at first to bringing his books, but this lapse was no doubt brought home to him by his Dosiri brethren, and when the time came he defied the Kazi's order to bring them. His claim has been ruled out with Shaikh Isa's concurrence. In the second case the diver is the plaintiff, and the Shaikh again has certified him as debt-free, which is probably more than his rights. This, however, scarcely punishes with sufficient distinctness the offence of contempt of the orders of the Shara' Court as well as of the Agency. The cases have been long in a state of suspense, and the Nakhudas have been watching for their outcome with close interest. The Nakhuda's idea is to stroll into the Agency and say that he has a claim of so many rupees against so and so and that he is ready to swear to it. The details are in his books, he does not remember them. Our attitude is that no claim can be allowed the details of which have not, as far as is practi cable, been made known. During the season an interesting dispute arose between Mr. Marx, British pearl merchant, and a local dealer, regarding the validity of various types of seals put on parcels of pearls under negotiation. Shaikh Isa was induced to appoint a special court of experts who defined the local custom in this matter. The statement was confirmed by Shaikh Isa. We have thus suc ceeded in getting a small fragment of the customary law codified, and this is useful. 'The decision went against Mr. Marx, but was fairly justified on grounds of common sense. Temperature. —The hot weather was comparatively cool which was in part accounted for by an unusual amount Cltoiat0 ' of north wind. The dampness of the atmosphere was, however, at least as excessive as usual, the difference between the wet and dry bulbs in summer being frequently less than 6° at 8 a.m. The maximum temperature was 1074° on 16th July 1911. The minimum temperature was'42-2° on 29th January 1911. The maximum and minimum temperatures in 1910 were 102-3° and 40-5° respectively. Rain fell on 26 days and aggregated 6-21of which 5-24' i, fell in six days in spring and winter. There was no rain between 19th April oim 1 and 3rd November. SaliM An unusual feature was the heavy rain received in the first half of November amounting to 2-74'. The total rainfall in 1910 was 4-02 f . The year was a particularly unhealthy one owing in the first place to the presence of epidemics. Plague began Healtl1, on 29th April 1911 and continued till 16th July 1911, and caused some 1,895 deaths. Cholera broke out in Novem ber and disappeared in December after accounting for some 268 lives. The year was further marked by an exceptional outbreak of malaria in early spring, repeated in autumn.105 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Quarantine was in force against Basrah and Mohammerah from August to 20th November; against Quarantine. Maskat f rom 5th April ^ 25th against Bushire from 5th May to 9th July. Bahrain was itself an infected port from 29th April to 27th July and 27th November 1911 to 7th January 1912. J The management of the quarantine left much to be desired. The staff maintained by Shaikh Isa is inadequate and the regulations were not pro perly enforced either on board ship or on land. Constant expostulations were made by the Agency, but without more than momentary effect. All that the personal effort of one individual could do was done by Assistant Surgeon Monani.

The year appears to have been on the whole a prosperous one commer- Commerce. ciall . v - Co . st of living and rates of wages continue to rise and are excessively high. One reason for this is the debauching nature of the pearl industry which has been discussed at greater length in the Trade Eeport for 1910. Another is the inefficiency of the arrangements for landing and deliver ing cargo which leads to much destruction of goods and loss of time and so enhances the price of imported articles. As Bahrain produces practically nothing, the term ' imported articles ' comprises all the necessaries of life. The substitution of a fortnightly for a weekly service of steamers by the T „ %T British India Steam Navigation Com- Ltd a Steam Nav,8a ' on Company ' pany, Ltd., with effect from May has caused considerable inconvenience. Mail connection with India and even Bushire has been made very slow. Occasional intermediate steamers do not help much as they are always more or less unexpected. The German firm of Messrs.

JNo representations have, however, been made as the C ^ D ?®, W T °^ ^ J entail, at any rate for some time, a heavy fall in Shaikh Is a srevenues, which he could not afford, and as the means for handling the existing amount of cargo are so unsatisfactory. This has for years been a fruitful cause of difficulty and discontent, and in the past year things were probably The Landing and Delivery of Cargo. worse than they have ever been before. The natural difficulties which have to be overcome are great, and neither the Government nor inhabitants of Bahrain can provide the brains or the ma e- rial means for overcoming them. Any hope of remedy that lay in the appointment of a European Landing Agent was speedily terminated by the ill-advised petitions ot tne commercial communities against the Wills regime (see last years Admin istration Report), and the subsequent refusal of Shaikh Isa to renew Mr. Wills' appointment on its expiry. A wave of Arab feeling demanded an Arab management, and two local Arabs were appointed to the charge. It is said that they were guarantee against loss by the other Arab merchants. They have proved totally in capable and indifferently honest, and things have gone steadily trom bad to worse Early in the year a Medjliss of representative foreign merchants was assembled by Major Knox, and the whole question was threshed out in detail and opinions expressing some degree of unanimity were recorded m writing. These opinions could not be turned to any practical purpose as it was at, 0 once objected that they only represented foreign feeling. Shaikh Isa eventually agreed to the summoning of a general Medjliss of all merchants to sit under the presidency of an unprejudiced outsider, Mr. Chick, Commercial Adviser to the Political Resident. When however a month later, in April, Mr. Chick arrived, the Shaikh declared himselt unable to depute Arab merchants to sit in the Medjliss within any reasonable time. The Medjliss had therefore to be held without the attendance of Arab irepresentatives, except at the end when they came and misbehaved them selves. They afterwards met separately. This foreign Medjliss drew up a very clear unanimous report on the defects existing and the remedies required. The Political Agent then attempted to get Shaikh Isa to discuss this statement with him with a view to determining how far it coincided with the opinions of the Arabs and how far its recommendations could immediately be put in force. The Shaikh, however, refused point-blank to discuss it verbally, and he gave either perfunctory answers, or no answers at all to letters addressed him on the subject. These ' negotiations were only finally abandoned in October. In the meantime all through the summer, and on till the close of the year, the landing service was hopelessly inefficient. The average rate of discharge from all vessels in harbour has-been, under 2,000 packages per day of 24 hours. The cases of the ' Fazilka ' and the ' Okhla ' in September, October and November may be mentioned. The former took 29 days to land 50,000 bags of rice of which 17,700 were landed in three days by Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., and the latter, 28 days to land 52,000 bags. Between May and October some 12 mail boats had to sail overcarrying cargo. The same cargo has in some cases been overcarried two or three times in succession. The chief results of constant expostulations by the Political Agent were attempts to impress foreign boat-owners, which had in their turn to be combated. On land the work of the Department has been no more satisfactory. The cargo of ' Fazilka ' and ' Okhla 55 and of still earlier boats had not been entirely delivered by the end of the year. Lying exposed to the weather rice had been damaged by rain to the value of many thousands of rupees.107 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF For this the Shaikh disclaims all responsibility. Unauthorised excess rates of fees are being charged and still the work is not being done. Every other branch of the work is on the same footing. The chief sufferers have perhaps been the Banyas, but all have suffered to a greater or less extent, and, by October, public opinion was considerably worked up. The Shaikh then without consulting or informing the Agency summoned a general meeting of merchants to obtain their consent to an increase of the various fixed charges, lighterage, donkey-hire. The Agency intervened and quashed this irregular proceeding. Subsequently a number of merchants, Arab and foreign, held a number of meetings and after much talk a draft prospectus of a Company to under take the landing business was submitted unsigned to Shaikh Isa who approved it and sent it on for the approval of the Political Agent. Approval was withheld, firstly, on the grounds that nothing was known of the appoint ment of the foreign representatives, and secondly, because the proposals were incomplete and unsatisfactory. % Since then the Political Agent has made enquiries and has found that the foreign representatives did not properly represent their communities and that they did not in fact approve the proposals; also that the Shipping Companies, as was obvious, could not agree to the rules it was sought to impose on them. The Agent of the Arab steamers, Yusuf Kanoo, shirked expressing his opinion, and asked for time to refer to Bombay. He had at first been one of the principal promoters. It is right to say that the foreign representatives were careful to keep the Political Agent informed of the progress of the discussion of the Com pany question. Matters are now practically at a deadlock. Nominally th final opinion of the Agency is awaited, but there is reason to believe that no section of the public is really in favour of the Company scheme, as put forward. The defects of the management are due to— (i) inherent physical difficulties, (n) insufficiency of boats, donkeys and men, {Hi) want of brains and honesty. A partial solution might be found in letting Shipping Companies land their own cargo, and reorganising the Delivery Department and importing a sufficient number of transport animals. The sensitiveness and incapacity of the Shaikh and the presence of deep international and personal jealousy and nristrust make at this hour of the day any satisfactory solution highly improbable. It is fair to say that Shaikh Isa, during the year, purchased some boats for lightering at a cost probably of some 20,000 rupees; and he is having s goods shed constructed, which is likely to cost him over Rs. 50,000. The pearling season was a prosperous one. The take of pearls was The Pearling Businees. fair ' aild prices in Bahrain, and subse quently in Bombay owing to the Coro nation, ruled very high. Monsieur Victor Rosenthal, the Frenchman, made his annual visit and was accompanied by a young brother and a cousin. He paid long prices, and probably made purchases to the extent of 30 to 40 lakhs of rupees. A British firm was represented by a Mr. Marx, who operated with much caution, and did not make very considerable purchases. A Bombay firm was represented by two brothers named Pack.

Excellent work is done by their well-equipped Hospital which is being more and more readily resorted to. The services of the American Doctor are much employed by the Shaikh's family. The Mission was last year able to acquire possession of a house of their own for their Bible and Book Shop in Manama Bazaar. It has been kept open throughout the year and is not known to have aroused any hostile feel ing. The senior missionary is Dr. S. M. Zwemer, a volatile but discreet person. He is restlessly energetic, and during the year paid visits to Katif, Iqair, Lingah and Baghdad. The opening of a branch of the Mission at Lingah is under considera tion. The Annual Conference of the Mission was held at Bahrain in Novem ber, and was attended by some 30 persons in all. In the end of 1910, some specimens of mosquitos and of supposed snakes connected in Manama were sent by Scientific.

Climate and Rainfall. —The climatic conditions during 1911 were fairly General favourable though the exceptional cold of January and February retarded the early spring growth in the desert and, though fodder was sufficient, it was not as plentiful as during the previous season; the averages of the maxi mum and minimum thermometers for the first three months of the year being from 15 to 5 degrees less than in the previous year. In consequence the summer was both shorter and milder. The total rainfall registered at the Agency Observatory amounted to 6 inches and 97 cents, which, though below the average, was better distributed over the year. An extract prepared from the Agency daily meteorological reports is attached. Local Affairs. —At the initiative of Shaikh Nasir bin Shaikh Mubarak a proposal was set on foot, in November, to start a ' Madrassah ' in Kuwait. A subscription list was opened and some Rs. 18,000 were subscribed on the spot. At the end of the year it was stated that the subscriptions had amounted to nearly a lakh of rupees including a donation of Rs. 50,000 from the house of Bin Brahim of Bombay. The Shaikh has promised to give to the institution some 13 shops in the bazaar and a date-garden at Basrah. The object of the school is to provide a modern education, which will fit local vouths for their battle in life better than the usual course of writing and Koran-reading given by local Mullahs. It is intended to import teachers from Cairo or Bey rout and to include foreign languages, particularly English in the curriculum. No murders or robberies have to be recorded for the year and the town continues, under the strong hand of Shaikh Mubarak, to be the most peaceful and best governed in the Gulf. Exchange, —The year under report has been an amelioration of local monetary conditions, for, in August, the Shaikh by a summary order practi cally demonetized the Maria Theresa dollar. All prices, sales, purchases have now to be quoted in Indian rupee currency and, though the measure was heartily welcomed by all shop-keepers and townspeople, who used to suffer severely from the constant fluctuation of the dollar, it is being assimilated only gradually by the Bedouin trading with Kuwait. Another measure which has done much to give stability to exchange and circumvent the opera tions in copper of local shroffs, adverted to in last year's report, was the intro duction bv the Shaikh of the Indian one-anna nickel coin for use as small change. The nickel coin has become very popular and hitherto there are no signs of its migration to Nejd, though this may come in time. The nickel coin appears to have been regarded with suspicion, until the Shaikh, on the Political Agent's suggestion, imported Rs. 10,000 worth and ordered their use. Postal Matters. —The reform most urgently required now in Kuwait is the institution of a regular Indian Post Office, similaf to the offices in Bahrain and Maskat. The work has hitherto been carried on by the Agency establishment, and its unofficial character precludes the booking of parcels, money orders and registered articles, all of which would be a source of considerable revenue. From the figures available for the last two years, the work has grown enor mously, especially in parcels and registered articles received for deliverj. Q311 ADMINISTRATION RKPORT OF THE PERSIAN GTJLF ThS matter has been represented to Government and it is hoped that steps towards the institution of a Post Office to meet the growing needs of the port may soon be taken. Celebrations. —The 22nd June being the Coronation day of His Majesty the King -Emperor, was observed as a fete day, the bhaikhs and the Agency fia^staffs were dressed, alms in cash were distributed to over 1,300 poor and in the evening the Agency was illuminated. Snaikn Mubarak with his son, Earned, dined with the Political Agent, and subsequently the other relatives of the Shaikh with all the leading men in Kuwait attended a reception held at the Agency. 7. Owing to the absence of the Political Agent on leave no Coronation Durbar festivities were held at Kuwait, on 12th December 1911. The Shaikh who was at Mohammerah at the time, however, sent orders to his son. Shaikh Jabir, to have his flagstaff dressed and to illuminate the town. Bin Sand's Fm*.—Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman ' bin Saud,' the Amir of Neid, visited the Shaikh at Sirra on 11th April 1911. The Shaikh accorded him a hearty welcome and loaded him with presents in food, clothes, etc for his men. ' Bin Saud ' arrived in Kuwait two days later with a large mounted following and returned to Sirra on the 15th; he was accom panied by his brothers, Muhammad and Saad. Visits were exchanged with the Political Agent by the whole family, who appeared cordially pleased to renew their former acquaintance. Shaikhs from Wai/.—Shaikhs Faisal-bin-Hamed and Shaikh Thari of the Al-Obeid ar-Rashid family left Kuwait in September and set out with a view to conducting intrigues from the north with the Thaffir and Anezah tribes against the Ruler of Hail. Subsequently finding little encouragement and being without resources, they have, it is said, gone to Eiadh, where they appear to be living on the bounty of ' Bin Saud ' Bedouin Shaikhs' Fmte.—Shaikhs of the Ajman, Thaffir, Umtair have visited Kuwait at various times during the year and most of them called od the Political Agent, who is now personally known to probably all the ant Shaikhs of these three tribes. During his tour and meeting with Bin Saud the Political Agent also made the acquaintance of several of the SnaikDs of the more southern tribes, the Kahtan, Dawasir, Saba'i, Sahul and iiani Khalid. On the whole there has been peace, law and order throughout Nejd during the year under review and tne Nejd Affairs. caravan routes were safe and passable during the whole period. In September 1911 it was reported, however, that differences had arisen at Hail between the members of the Ibn Sebhan family. Zamil Ibn Sebnan, the guardian of the young Saud Ibn Rashid, was said to be true to the young prince, whilst his cousin, the Treasurer of the State, wished to oust the boy and usurp the power for the Ibn Sebhan family; the wish has not apparent y materialized. In May 1911, one Muhammad bin Abdulla-bin-Thaneyan visited Shaikh Mubarak. He was a youth of about 18 years whose arrival created so interest as he represents the house of one of the former Wahabi Amirs a is a distant cousin of Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud. His father had been held as hostage in Constantinople and Muhammad was born there. He was repor to be well educated, to speak several languages and to have been 0 ' er ,• 2 Mutasariflik of Hasa by the Turkish Government which he refused P eI1 ° a consultation with Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud.

His truce with ' Bin SauaPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 112 so far continued, contrary to expectation, and no doubt saved his southern and eastern boundaries from being ravaged. ' Bin Saud's ' Raids. — 4 ' Bin Saud 55 successfully raided the Safran, Suleiman sections of the Ajman tribe and a section of the Dawasir in Febru ary at Hamara, two days' distance from Hasa. The Tha'an, Bin Diblan, Uth-Dhamir and Mahfuth sections of the Ajman tribe were raided by Abdul Aziz ' Bin Saud' in May at Jaf near Hasa together with a number of Dawasir and Al-Morrah tribesmen camped with them. At about the same time he also marched against the people of Regeijha close to Hasa, but the latter on hearing of the raid collected in the fort, closed the gates, and begged protection from the Mutasarif of Hasa, promising to pay anything that might be arranged. Bin Saud 55 demanded that all the property of his people looted before should be returned to him, that all people of other than the Ajman tribe should leave Hasa and its environs for their own districts and that he should be permitted to build a fort at Regeijha. The Mutasarif interviewed and treated ' Bin Saud' with much respect, promising to accede to his wishes. ' Bin Saud ' also demanded from the Ajman tribesmen at Regeijha, 3,000 camels and the surrender of 30 men for punishment or in lieu of the men blood-money at 800 in cash a head. The Ajman tribesmen repudiated these terms and having persuaded the Mutasarif's men in charge of the fort to take their part opened fire against ' Bin Saud.' The latter, without retaliating, complained io the Mutasarif who, whilst regretting the action of his soldiers, agreed to impri son or punish the men in fault. 44 Bin Saud ' then pardoned them with the exception of Fahad bin Hithlain. one of the Shaikhs of the Ajman, and Khomeis, Shaikh of the Safran, who were to be kept prisoners until his demands were complied with. On the Mutasarif complying, ' Bin Saud' burnt all the tents and houses at Regeijha. About the end of September it was reported that the Beni Abdulla, a distant section of the Umtair tribe who usually pay Zikat ' to ' Bin Saud being camped with the Harb tribe south of Hail had paid their annual quota to Ibn Rashid's Zikat collectors. Negotiations between ' Bin Saud' and Ibn Rashid bore no fruit and about the end of October news was received that ' Bin Saud ' with a large force of the Ataibah tribe had successfully raided the Beni Abdulla and Harb tribes between Nejd and Medina. How^- ever, the Ataibah tribe, taking advantage of their superior force, decamped with the whole of the loot, leaving nothing for ' Bin Saud. A certain amount was subsequently returned, but' Bin Saud ' is not on good terms with this tribe and raids against it are contemplated. ' Bin Saud ' and the Shariff of Mecca—Tht Shariff of Mecca has taken no serious steps to enforce the terms of the document regarding Kasim, which be extorted from ' Bin Saud ' last year and, powerless as he is, it is doubtful whether he will ever be able to press actively for ' Bin Saud's ' compliance with them, except by correspondence. The Shariff addressed Shaikh Mubarak on the subject and was accorded the usual polite reply that Kasim was beyond Mubarak's province and he could not interfere in Bin Saud's ' affairs. The 11 A raif' —During the year the Araif ' have not made themselves conspicuous by any raiding or other operations. They have been shelterin g with the Shariff of Mecca and intrigues will doubtless continue. ' Bin Saud ' at the close of the year was reported to be marching westwards with a large force of the Umtair, Sabai' and Sagool tribes to attack the ' Araif ' and the son of the Shariff of Mecca who were said to be to the north of Medina with the Ateyba Bedouin. Hasa. —In the month of May news came of a fight between the Bahrainis of Safwa and the Bani Khalid and Sabia tribes resulting in a loss of 40 men killed on the side of the Bahrainis. The reason of the fight was said to be an old dispute and frequent dissensions between the Bedouin and Bahrainis. The Anizah Tribe.—In April it was reported that the Rowalla Anizah had raided Ibn Rashid's people in the vicinity of Jaf.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF lio Saad-bin-Mazi Al-Mutawatah, a petty Shaikh and head of some Anizah tribesmen allied to Shaikh Mubarak, with his brother, Akil, raided the Ajman and Shammar tribes in July inflicting some loss m men and cattle. The Thaffir Tn^.—Thaffiris about 60 in number looted the Jiblan section of the Umtair tribe in the Subhan between As-Safa and El-Hafar in the second week of March. Raids and counter-raids do not appear to have been so rife this year as formerly. From this it can be in- Tribai Polltlcs ' ferred that relations between the tribes have improved to some extent and the few raids noted below can only be taken as spasmodic ones. The growing strength of ' Bin Sand,' his alliance with Ibn Rashid, and the friendly terms existing between these two powers and Shaikh Mubarak probably account for the improvement. News reached Kuwait in the second week of April that Saud bin Lami, an outlaw Shaikh of the Jiblan Umtair, with a party of Anizah Bedouin! raided the Kuwait Rashaisah Bedouin and had taken from them some 600 to 900 camels. Bin Lami after the raid was said to have gone to Shaikh Sa'adun at Khomisia. Shortly afterwards the Thaffir Bedouin raided and looted the tents of the womenfolk left in his camp by Saud bin Lami but let the women have mounts to go and re-join Bin Lami. In July news was received that Faisal-ud-Dawish, Shaikh of the Umtair, had attacked the Ajman at the wells near al-Muteira and defeated them inflicting some loss in men. Some of the Umtair tribe of the Dawish and Al-Fugan sections success fully raided a small party of the Thaffir in the vicinity of Chabaidah to the west of Safwan in August 1011. Ajman Tribe. —About the beginning of July it was reported that whSet ' Bin Saud ' was returning to Riadh he was met on the road between Eiadh and Hasa by a large force of the Arjha section of the Ajman tribe. A figfet ensued resulting in several casualties on both sides. In July the Ajman Bedouin also raided the Rashaidah, Tawatah and some of the Umtair sections at Al-Haisheri taking some sheep and camels. The Umtair is and others, however, quietly combined afterwards and retali ated successfully by looting a large number of sheep and goats with a few camels. In the same month news was received that the Ajman had again raided the Tawatah, Rashaidah and Awazim sections of about 150 of their camels at Haseilan, Atarez and Moraka between Anta'a and Kuwait but that the latter eventually succeeded in re-taking the looted property. About a month later Thaidan bin Hithlain, Shaikh of the Ajman, came to Kuwait and com posed matters with Shaikh Mubarak in connection with this raid. Al bu Ainain Tribe. —The settlement of this tribe at Kasr-as-Sabaih may now be regarded as permanent and it is not improbable that their rela tions with the Turkish officials in Katif and Hasa will lead to difficulties- Rumours of the erection of a Turkish flagstaff were current, frequent visits by soldiers from Katif were paid to the place and at the end of the year reports of a Turkish military post being established at Kasr-as-Sabaih were irequent. It is believed that the post has since actually come into being. The position of the settlement at a point on the coast adjacent to sontf of the best pearl-banks, and to which pearl-boats have frequent recourse ic supplies and water, makes it undesirable that the Turkish authorities shorn 0 obtain a permanent footing there. Shaikh Mubarak moreover claims ju rl diction over the territory. Shaikh Sa'adun. —About the end of March news was received of severe lighting between the Muntafick and the Thaffir at a place called El Hanip m which Shaikh Sa'adun's sons, Ajami and Thamir, were dangerou _ wounded and his nephew Najam killed. Previously a solution of the cli ences between the Thaffir and Shaikh Sa'adun had been arranged throug Kashid, but, on the latter leaving for Hail, Sa'adun attempted to bePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. 114. and overbearing. On his calling upon the Badur and Ziad tribes allied to the Muntafick to support him these two tribes sided with the Thaffir. Sa'adun then marched north with the Thaffir following him. He was short of water and the Thaffir seized what ponds and wells there were in the vicinity of El Haniyeh and caught his water-camels and men. Finally Sa'adun having been without water for three or four days was compelled to halt and the Thaffir with the advantage of freshly watered camels attacked him. Sa'adun was completely routed and left all his tents, camels, womenkind and gear in the Thaffir's hands. In May the principal Thaffir Shaikhs came to Kuwait and were well received by Shaikh Mubarak. They included Hamud-us-Suwait, Nafa'a bin Buwaihi of the As-Smid section and Thair Abu Thara'a of the As-Smid section and when visiting the Political Agent had no words bad enough for Sa'adun. In July when Shaikh Sa'adun went to Basrah to pay his respects to Saiyid Talib (son of the Nakhib of Basrah) on his return from Constantinople he was decoyed by the Wali of Basrah on board the ' Marmaris ' and then arrested on account of his continued molestation and tyranny towards the people and travellers in the desert. He was deported by the Turkish authori ties to Alleppo where, it was reported, he died in November 1911. Shaikh Subah bin Muhammad, Shaikh Mubarak's nephew, came from shaikh Mubarak's Affairs, Basrah on the 13th June to attend the marriage of his own daughter and niece to Shaikhs Salim bin Hamed as-Subah and Hamed bin Mubarak. The marriages took place on the 22nd and 23rd June. A Jewish band of about 12 musicians from Basrah was engaged for the occasion by Shaikh Mubarak, and some mild festivities indulged in. In February, the Shaikh purchased more land on the Shatt-el-Arab; his object was to round off his Matawah property as the date-gardens now bought from Abdur Razak Beg of the A1 Mansur family formed a strip between two plots formerly purchased. With Turkey. —Shaikh Mubarak's relations with the Ottoman authori- Shaikh Mubarak's Foreign Relation., f ' 6 ® during the year under report have been very fairly friendly and no serious differences have arisen. Early in June the protective works of the Shaikh's Fao estate were inter fered with by the fort commandant, but a visit from the Sheikh's secretary brought the Wali of Basrah on the scene, who took energetic steps to prevent further trouble in this direction. In July the Shaikh received a begging letter from the Wali of Basrah appealing to him as a good Mohammedan for a subscription towards the re construction of the Government offices in Constantinople destroyed by fire, and the Shaikh, feeling it difficult to refuse a contribution in view of the terms of the appeal, sent the Wali £T. '500. In August Jasim bin Brahim of the big Kuwait pearl-dealing firm in Bombay purchased for £T. 180,000 all the ' Sanieh ' date gardens on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab from near the Dawasir Islands to Basrah. The property originally belonged to the mother and other relatives of the ex-Sultan Abdul Hamed and reverted to the Turkish Government on his down fall. In connection with this purchase a long article appeared in the Basrah paper Ar-Rishad ' vehemently denouncing the purchase and insinuating that Jasim, who had so long resided in Bombay, was acting on behalf of the British Government. The article, said to be from the pen of Saiyid Talib, the Basrah Parliamentary Deputy, was violently anti-English in tone. When the Turko-Italian War broke out in October, the Shaikh, at the instance of the Ulema in Turkey, opened a subscription list in aid of the war and at the end of November it was reported that he'had taken a lakh of rupees to Basrah to be handed over to the Wali for remittance to Constantinople Later information puts the amount at the more probable figure of £T. 3,000^ of which local merchants contributed rather more than two-thirds.115 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF On 8th November, Shaikh Mubarak was informed that His Majesty the Sultan had conferred a Turkish decoration on him. Nothing further was heard up to the end of the year, but m January 1912 it became known that some Basrah notables had been selected to convey and present the decoratiun the 1st Class of the Medjidie, to Shaikh Mubarak at Kuwait. With the British Government. —The Shaikh's relations with ourselves have been frank and friendly and his co-operation in prohibiting the arms traffic has been maintained at some considerable personal loss in revenue. The Shaikh was desirous of attending the Coronation Durbar at Delhi but the project was found impracticable. His Majesty the King-Emperor, however, on this occasion conferred on the Shaikh an Honorary Knight Commandership in the Order of the Indian Empire, an honour which was much appreciated by the Ruler of Kuwait and by his subjects. With the Shaikh of Mohammerah. —The Shaikh's relations with the Shaikh of Mohammerah seem to be growing more and more intimate. He visited Shaikh Khaz'al several times during the year and about the close of the year made a prolonged stay of over 40 days at Failiyah. He also intends building a house near Shaikh Khaz'al's palace for his residence on visits to the place. Shaikh Khaz'al visited Kuwait on 12th October. He was warmly received by the Shaikh who dressed his flagstaff for three days in his honour. Shaikh Khaz'al after visiting Kadhamah and Jahrah in Shaikh Mubarak's company, left for Failiyah, on 20th October. It was rumoured that Shaikh Mubarak had given him a site on the west side of the town and that he proposed to build a house thereon for his residence. On the 17th November Doctor Francis, Medical Officer to Shaikh Khaz'al, arrived at Kuwait to treat Shaikh Mubarak for neuralgic pains in the back and left arm. He left for Mohammerah on the 27th November. With the Shaikh of Bahrain. —The Shaikh's friendship with the Shaikh of Bahrain, which appeared to be somewhat cooled by the latter's refusal of assistance in ejecting Kuwait subjects who had emigrated to Bahrain as reported last year under ' Pearl Fisheries,' has been revived during this year. Shaikh Mubarak left on 6th July on a visit to Shaikh Isa bin Khalifah and returned on the 18th. He was received by the latter with much honour. The visit's real object, it appeared, was the bringing back of his errant subject, Hilal Umtairi, the wealthiest Kuwait pearl merchant, and in this the Shaikh was successful, for Hilal Umtairi returned to Kuwait about a month after. With the American Mission. —The American Mission continues its peaceful work in Kuwait and seems to be enjoying the good-will of Shaikh Mubarak. The Bible shop which was opened last year continues selling religious books to the people in the town. There was no medical officer in charge of the Mission's charitable dis pensary permanently during the year. Dr. P. W. Harrison occasionally visited the place and once he travelled by overland route to Basrah. T&gt;. Mylrea of the American Mission visited Kuwait from Bahrain on 30th June and remained a little more than a month. At the close of the year Dr. Harrison returned to Kuwait from Bahrain with the Rev. and Mrs. Calverley. Mrs. Calverley is the first lady doctor who has visited Kuwait and finds a fair measure of work for her skill. The public health of Kuwait has been very good and no epidemic occurred Public Health. during the year under report in Kuwai itself or in the vicinity. The Agency Dispensary was open throughout the year and the tota T2* e 4 0f P atie . nts treated amounted to 3,426, averaging a daily attendance ^ qL aS again ^ 3 ^ 62 last y ear - 0f 3,426 patients 2,577 were men and 849 women and children. The attendance of sick in the dispensary has steadily declined during the last two vears, due to the establishment of a dispensary by the American Mission with a European doctor in charge.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1911. ^0 Only five vaccinations were performed during the year, of which three proved unsuccessful and the rest remained unknown. The lanoline lymph from the Bangalore Laboratory is said to have given better results than the preserved vaccine from Belgaum which is being supplied now. Quarantine.- —Until the end of June passengers arriving from infected ports were detained in boats to undergo the quarantine period. In July, however, it is satisfactory to note, the Shaikh was induced to establish better quarantine arrangements, and when Basrah and Mohammerah were cholera-infected in August and Bahrain in December, passengers were iso lated on Kurain Island where tents were pitched for their accommodation and water and supplies sent daily from the town by the Shaikh. Abdul Mehsin, the Shaikh's Customs Master who had sole control of the CuBtoms Administration. management of the Customs, over- reached himself m August and his peculations and overbearing attitude towards the merchants were at last brought to the Shaikh's notice. Shaikh Mubarak therefore deputed Haii Ali, formerly the British News Agent in Kuwait, to keep all accounts of the Customs receipts and payments jointly with Abdul Mehsin and gave him an Arab clerk to help in the work. The measure seems to have satisfied merchants. Naval and Marine. XT The foj^wing ships of His Majesty's . _ -Navy and Royal Indian Marine visited Kuwait during the year :— H. M. S. ' Philomel,' on 27th January and 18th February. H. M. S. ' Highflyer,' on 21st April. R. I. M. S. &lt;c Palinurus,' on 29th September 1911. R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' visited Kuwait five times during the year. His Excellency Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, K.C.I.E., M.V.O., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, with the Political Resident visited Kuwait in the ' Highflyer ' accompanied by the ' Lawrence' in April. The usual visits were exchanged with the Shaikh. Despite the vigilance of British men-of-war in the Gulf of Oman and Arms Traffic. t ^ e Shaikh's express orders prohibiting . ' his subjects from importing arms into Kuwait, systematic attempts are still being made to smuggle arms by some arms-dealers, mostly Persians. In April 1911, an attempt to smuggle a number of revolvers was made by a Nakhuda, Haji Sadeck, from Maskat, but they were discovered by the Customs Master. In the same month a ' boom ' in charge of one Ebrahim bin Mishal as Nakhuda was captured by the Navy with arms on board and taken to Jask. The ' boom ' was returning from India and at Maskat the Nakhuda took rifles on board for conveyance to Kuwait and was promised $10 per rifle as freight. This ' boom,' however, was found to belong to a Katr Arab, the Nakhuda being a Kuwait. A shipment of 25 cases marked K. R. B. from Antwerp purporting to contain loaf-sugar, transhipped at Bombay, reached Kuwait without detec tion in the British India Steam Navigation Company's S. S. ' Palamcotta ' on the 24th July. After the steamer had discharged five capes one case was accidentally broken in being lowered into the lighter alongside the steamer and rifles were seen packed between the layers of sugar-loaves. The Captain, in the absence of the Political Agent, refused delivery and overcarried the whole shipment to Basrah to be disposed of under the Political Resident's instructions. A similar shipment containing arms which was on its way to Kuwait from Antwerp was intercepted by the Customs authorities in Bombay. About the end of July it was reported that a Persian by name Khalil had shipped some arms in a boat for Rohilla, but no definite news could be obtained.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Another Kuwait ' boom ' belonging to Muhammad Hasan bin Ghulam was captured by the Navy, in October, 30 miles north of Maskat, with 60 pistols, 300 rifles and 90,000 rounds ammunition on board. No slaves took refuge in the Agencv Slave Trade. nor was ^ a ppii ca tion received for manumission during the year under report. The Kuwait pearling fleet left for the pearl-banks about the beginning of May and returned about the enS Pearl Fisheries. of August for the fast during the montll of Ramzan. The pearlers who had intended to leave again for the after the Ramzan month left, on Shaikh Mubarak's insistence, before tlie Id-ul-Fitr. The year's catch was said to have been a good one, and as prices also ruled very high early in the season the year was a good one for the Towashes. There was a fall in the market at one time owing to reports of a probable war between France and Germany, but these rumours did not materially affect the prices realized during the season. The wealthiest Kuwait pearl merchant, Hilal Umtairi who emigrated to Bahrain as mentioned in last year's report, was reconciled to Shaikh Muba rak and returned to Kuwait at the end of September. As no pearl fishery was held in Ceylon this year no passes were issued to Kuwait divers for proceeding thither. The British India Steam Navigation Company's steamers continued to gh j ppin call at Kuwait fornightly on their out- ' ping ' ward voyage only until the end of May when consequent on the introduction of a new time-table and mail service Kuwait became a port of call on their inward voyage also from Basrah. This arrangement gives a much superior mail and passenger service, for the port now has a weekly mail service and a fortnightly passenger service both up and down the Gulf and the necessity for sending the Agency launch to Jao fortnightly to fetch Kuwait mails is obviated. Only one fast mail steamer called at Kuwait in March with passengers from Bombay. Two steamers of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company called at Kuwait during tTie year with passengers and cargo. Two English steamers, the S. S. ' Tangistan ' and the S. S. ' Gloamin,' called at Kuwait during 1911, the former with 500 ba^s sugar and the latter with 10,000 cases petroleum. About the end of February news reached Kuwait of the flotation of an Arab Shipping Company with a capital of Rs. 10,00,000 in Bombay. The reason given for this step was that Arab shippers were weary of the British India Steam Navigation Company's methods. They complained that the Company was selfish and inconsiderate and its subordinates exacting and arrogant whilst its officers^ were oppressive and ill-treated passengers. It wa,s also said that the British India Agents in Bombay had approached the prime movers m the matter and endeavoured to prevent the scheme's fruition _u witnout success. Only two steamers of the new Company called at Kuwait during the year.

He was an Egyptian and correspondent of the ' A1 Moayad,' a Cairo paper. Articles relating to Kuwait and the Persian Gulf which had been appearing in the paper were evidently written before his arrival in Kuwait and he seems to have come t© see their effect. Shaikh Mubarak was not particularly pleased, for he did not give him the usual present he bestows on other visiting correspondents. Kapitan Lieutenant a. D. Bbde, late of the Imperial German Navy, who was a passenger by the Arab steamer S. S. ' Lawoe,' landed at Kuwait on 10th October with the intention of seeing Shaikh Mubarak and continu ing his journey to Basrah overland. The Shaikh, who was asleep at the time, could not see him before the ship sailed and Herr Bode therefore left in her commenting on the Shaikh s apparent want of courtesy. The Political Agent made an extended tour of 40 days in the hinterland rr j tt ^ . u rw • i during February and March. He Tours and Visits of British: Officials. t 0 , ,-ii i marched south until he reached Anta a whence he went on to the camp of Salman bin Hamed and Ali bin Khalifa, then in command of Shaikh Mubarak's standing force in the desert. He then marched three days S. W. and reached ' Bin Sand's ''camp at Ellaimiya on the 6th March. He was received in the most friendly and hospitable manner by Abdul Aziz and his brothers and met many of the Ajman, Sabai' and Al-Morrah Shaikhs in the camp. He remained with ' Bin Saud ' from the 6th to the 9th, marching W. N. W. with him to Thaj, an interesting place^ with relics of a former civilization, probably Himyaritic. ' Bin Saud ' and his brothers were all particularly friendly and hospitable and the Political Agent much enjoyed the novel experience of travelling as an honoured guest with the men who at the moment probably have most influence in Central Arabian affairs. On ' Bin Saud ? s ' advice the Political Agent altered his tour as the country to the south was reported to be unsafe with marauding Ateyba Bedouin taking advantage oi Bin Sand's absence so far north. He reached A1 Haba wells on the 17th March, halted a day and proceeded N. E. He found the Suman tract not particularly easy travelling as the district is a Buccession of valleys and 1 plateaux* interspersed with steep hillocks; The* going is rendered difficult by limestone rocks, chips and boulders. The district was, however, very green with new vegetation and would have been magnificent grazing, ground but for the want of wells. Over 600 miles were covered before return to Kuwait, the greater part entirely unexplored, except by Colonel Lewis Pelly in his march to Biadh, The Political Resident visited Kuwait thrice during the year. Captain S. G. Craufurd, D.S.O., Intelligence Officer, Jask, visited Kuwait during the first week of July. Captain C. B. McConaghy, M.B., I.M.S., Residency Surgeon in the Persian Gulf, arrived on 8th September to inspect the Agency Charitabl© Dispensary. The Political Agent visited Bushire in the Agency steam launch ' Lewis Pelly ' in July, and His Majesty's Consuls at Basrah and Moham- merah twice during the year. Captain W. H. I.

Gunter assumed charge of the Mekran Goast in October, vice Mr. R. C. Barker, C.I.E., on the latter's appointment as Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, at the India Office. Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., relieved Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, at Bahrain, whilst the latter assumed charge of the Kerman Consulate on the departure of Lieutenant-Colonel T. W. Haig, C.M.G., on furlough. Major W. E. T. O'Connor, C.I.E., who was at the time en route to succeed Lieutenant-Colonel Haig at Kerman, was deputed by the Government of India, at the request of His Majesty's Minister, to assume charge of the Shiraz Con sulate on the appointment of Mr. W. A. Smart to officiate as Oriental Secretary at Tehran.2 PEBSIAN GrTTLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT ^ 'With the enforced departure of Mr. Sinister from Tehran, the General scepticism prevailing amongst intelligent Persians of the possibility^ improyeinentin the moral and material condition of the country without effective foreign intervention, has given place to a settled conviction of the futility of any efforts made by the Central Government to restore order Eussian troops have remained in considerable numbers m Northern Persia, and on our part, it has not yet been found practicable to effect any reduction in the numbers of British troops employed as Consular guards in the South, tWli His Majesty's Government are anxious to withdraw them as soon as possible. No loans were raised by the Persian Government during the year; His Majesty's Government, however, accorded advances, totalling £50,000 to he devoted to the administrative necessities of Ears : local authorities all over the country declared their inability to carry on the administration, or even- collect revenue without the assistance of large subventions from the Central Govern ment, whose failure to meet such demands was ^ urged in extenuation of the general incapacity of local authorities to maintain law and order. The fear is that the demoralization of the country generally and the decay of the whole organization of Government have progressed too far to be cured by the most liberal subventions : and that, failing some unforeseen development, the most that can be hoped from the grant of financial assistance is that the inevitable day of reckoning will be postponed for a few years longer, the account becom ing meanwhile steadily more formidable, and less within the power of the country to liquidate. Financial assistance, and the measure of control over local administration involved thereby, once withdrawn, there must always be the danger that the administration would relapse into chaos, owing to the fact that tribesmen and peasantry alike are now well armed, and are conscious of their power, whilst men of sufficient honesty of purpose and capability to take up the reins when we lay them down, cannot be produced by Persia now, nor could they be produced in the present generation. As in the previous year, the position of affairs in Pars generally, and on shiraz and Fa« tlle BusMre-Ispahaii road,_ loomed large on the political horizon, and it seems increas ingly clear that for some time to come the line of action pursued by His Majesty's Government in regard to the problems presented by the roads of this province will form the touchstone upon which our subsequent policy in South Persia will be tested and regulated. The negatively unsatisfactory state in which things remained during the Kawam s acting incumbency of the post of Governor-General, gave place, on the arrival of the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh, to a brief period of hope that some permanent improvement might result from his appointment. Such hopes were not fulfilled : it was anticipated by Mr. Smart, when this nomination was fiis mooted that he would prove rather too civilised for so turbulent a province as ars, which only a Governor-General of the old fire eating type could hope o prmg under control, without ample funds, which the Central Government was in no position to provide.FOR THE YEAR 1912. 3 telegraphy had not advanced beyond the preparation of estimates of the cost of constructing the necessary buildings, and though the framework of a lighthouse Lighting .ad buojing i„ the Gulf. ^ought^out and deposited oa Tanb Island m October, and several gas buoys - landed at the embryo lighthouse dep6t at Abadan, it was not found practicable to instal any of the latter during the year, and the Engineer deputed to erect the former only arrived in the Gulf towards the end of December. On the other hand, some 5,000 tons of coal were unostentatiously deposited Hen - aln on our concession on Henjam during the spring, without raising any protest from the local authorities or the Persian Government, and towards the end of the year the coaling staff were transferred to Henjam from Basidu, which thus reverts to its former state of peaceful obscurity. The Bahrain Order in Council underwent further careful examination : judicial. an( l c l ose o; f year it was under stood that it was on the eve of publica tion. An Order in Council was issued in May modifying the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907, so as to include within its limits Mohammerah, with its dependencies, and the Coast and maritime provinces of Persia, the latter term being defined as meaning the provinces of Arabistan, Ears, Laris- tan, Kerman, Persian Baluchistan, and those districts by custom and for the time being included under the authority of the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports. The effect of this change has been to make the judicial sphere in Persia of His^ Majesty's Consulate-General correspond in a large measure with its administrative sphere, and to empower all political officers within it, who are endowed with judicial powers to function when occasion requires, to act under the Gulf Order, subject to the usual authorization of the Government of India. The negotiations with the Porte for a settlement of our conflicting inter- Anglo-Turkish Negotiation. es ^ s ^ -Persian Gulf, to which refer ence was made in last year's report, have made but little progress : it was not until April 15th that the Turkish reply to our proposals of July 29th, 1911, was received, and on all important points it was almost wholly unfavourable ; whilst Great Britain has claimed nothing new, but has merely been asking for the recognition of the position which she has built up for herself in the regions affected, Turkey took advantage of the negotiations to assert claims which she never has been, and is not now, in a position to substantiate. The rejoinder of His Majesty's Government to the Turkish counter-pro posals was sent in July : but the outbreak of the Turko-Balkan war no doubt prevented deliberate consideration of our reply by the Ottoman Government, and no reply had been received up to the close of the year. As in 1911, so during the current year, whilst His Majesty's Government deemed it expedient during the pendency of the above negotiations to refrain from overt action at Kuwait or elsewhere which could be colourably interpret ed as a breach of the status quo, the Turks continued to violate it ^ in various directions notably in connection with lighting arrangements on the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab. Steady progress was made during the year with the construction of the The Baghdad Railway. line, in spite of the Turko-Italian and Turko-Balkan wars, but it would appear that the (jrerman employes of the line have incurred the distrust and dislike of the natives, whom they are stated to have so far treated with no very rigid justice and with scanty consideration. 0 An agreement was reached during the year between the Baghdad Eailway Company and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who formed a Transport; Syndicate to purchase and run vessels on the Tigris, specially to deal with the former Company's requirements : had such a com promise not been arrived at, it would have been open to the Baghdad Eailway Company to run vessels of their own under Article 9 of their concession. The4 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Russian Government was inclined to be dissatisfied at the arrangement, on the ground that it would accelerate the construction of the railway. No active steps were taken by the Russian Government to obtain a con cession for a Khanikin-Tehran line, pursuant to the arrangement come to with Germany at the ' Potsdam interview ' of the previous year. This project continued to be the subject of active discussion, and several officers of the Government of India wen. Tram-Persian Railway. i i • -u a 'WV engaged during the year m surveying various possible alignments within the British zone. Up to the end of the year His Majesty's Government had not made knovn its final attitude to the project, but the trend of official opinion was decidedly opposed to it on strategical and general grounds, whilst as a commercial proposition, further expert investigation has tended to indicate that it is likely to prove, on the whole, unattractive. The Persian Eailways Syndicate renewed its application to the Persian , ^ v 3 r&gt; m Government for a concession for this line Monammeran-Khoremmabad Railway. -j • i • _ ^ xt, i. J and m doing so received the strong sup port of His Majesty's Government. The Syndicate were informed in April that the Government of India and the Board of Trade were disposed to doubt the likelihood of a Mohammerali- Khoremmabad line being commercially successful, whilst recognizing that the suggested Mohammerah-Dizful line would probably be less unremunerative. The Syndicate on the other hand expressed the opinion that there was practi cally no doubt that, of all the proposed railways running from the south of Persia northwards, this railway was by far the most attractive and the most likely to prove a commercial success, even if only carried to Khoremmabad but that, if carried further north to Hamadan, its success would, in their opinion, be undoubted ; whilst they regarded any idea of this railway stopping at DizM with great disfavour. Negotiations for a concession were actively proceeding at the end of the year. No progress was made by the Persian Eailways Syndicate with negotiations Railways in Fars for lines other than the Mohammerali- Khoremmabad project. His Majesty's Go vernment have expressed to the Russian Government their willingness to discuss with them railway concessions in the neutral zone, but not to claim their con sent to such lines as a matter of right until the Trans-Persian Railway shall have proceeded beyond the Russian sphere. At the same time, the Societe d'etudes, for the Trans-Persian Railway project, was informed that, whilst His Majesty's Government undertook (subject to certain reservations) to support them in securing an option for the main line of the Trans-Persian Railway, on the understanding that it should not be exercised outside the Russian sphere until His Majesty's Government deemed it politic and feasible, they were unable to support an application even for a branch line outside that sphere. The Government of India expressed the opinion that the investigations and lepoits or Messrs. Chick and Wilson established claims to a careful consideration o a usmre-Shiraz-Ispahan line and recommended its inclusion in the list of mes or which options or concessions were being asked; it is understood, however, tnat up to the end of the year the Persian Railways Syndicate had confined their piesen emancl to the Mohammerah-Khoremmabad concession, the other lines mentioned m the draft concessions being omitted.

Bahrain . . . .2 lighted and 1 unlighted buoys. An unlighted buoy was established at Bandar Abbas in March, and the Lighthouse superstructure was landed at Tanb Island in October, and at the end of the year Mr. G. J. Homer, an experienced Assistant Engineer of the Public Works Department, was deputed by the Government of India for its erection. Lighted buoys for Bushire and Bahrain arrived during the year, but owing to various technical difficulties connected with their establishment, it was not found practicable to bring them into operation before its close. Although the anarchy which prevailed throughout 1912 in Laristan and the hinterland prevented His Majesty's Vice-Consul from seeing much of the in terior, it will be seen from Mr. New's report that he was able during the year to visit most of the Chiefs of the littoral, as well as the chief of the important district of Bastak and to cultivate friendly relations with them, which have already borne fruit in facilitating the settlement of local claims : in the latter category reference may be made to the friendly and effective action of Shaikh Sagar of Naband in promptly handing over to His Majesty's Yice-Consul, three men implicated in a bad case of piracy on a Kuwait boat: the men were taken to Kuwait in H. M. S. &lt;e Philomel,' and, after due enquiry by the Political Agent, were handed over to Shaikh Mubarak : the case is still in course of disposal. Lingah is the only Persian Port of the littoral visited to any great extent by Arabs of Oman and the Trucial Coast and Bahrain, and the presence of a British officer at Lingah has enabled us to give them much more effective protection and assistance than formerly, a fact which there is reason to believe they fully appreciate. Captain Biscoe's remarks regarding Monsieur Zwinne's ill-conceived schemes for strengthening his personal position and influence at the expense of the Local Government on the pretext of effecting financial reforms, and his inability to keep faith either with His Majesty's Consul or with the merchants, show that Monsieur Zwinne has learnt little from pasfc experience. He displayed similar moral timidity, with much the same result, at Bushire in 1909, and it was the same unfortunate tendencies which led to his enforced departure from Mohammerah at the beginning of 1911 (vide page 68, Adminis tration Eepot for 1911). The difficulties in which several Indian firms were involved at Bandar Abbas, owing to the failure of Persian merchants to meet their obligations, thanks to the prevailing anarchy and the insecurity of the trade routes, are of more than merely local interest. It is noteworthy that Bandar Abbas is the only post of importance on the Persian littoral where Indian merchants are estab lished in any numbers, and Kerman, likewise in the British sphere, the only town in the interior where they are strongly represented. Apart, therefore, from the imperial question of British interests in general the Government of India are separately interested, to a peculiar degree, in the security of the Bandar Abbas-Kerman route and in the commercial conditions prevailing at both places ; and in seeing that every assistance in our power is rendered to these Indian firms, who have successfully established themselves in the face of so many difficulties, and maintained their position for over a century at Bandar Abbas.g PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT As the close of the year, with the advent to Kermaii of an energefe Bakhtiari Governor, the prospects of security on the mam road were somewhat - DcllV11 , , i j - j • frk l-ir^rkP fnv Trmrn T^Pirma.nfinf, rpcnH more favourable; but it is difficult to hope tor much permanent result from the well -intentioned but spasmodic efforts of successive Governors-General ha ered as they are by universal anarchy and lack of funds and innocent of definite policy or aim. The end of 1911 found the situation in the Kerman province still as unsatisfactory as it could well be, and Kermn. conditions in^ Kerman itself specifically disci uietins Local authority practically did not exist, the bazaars were closed in excited protest against the recent action of Russia m hanging certain Mullahs at Tabriz • national volunteers were ostentatiously parading , the Hussian Con sulate completely, and the British Consulate in some measure, boycotted. The arrival of a new Governor-General, however, who started on satis factory lines and inaugurated his regime by scattering a powerful local faction which had been respgnsible for a good deal of local anarchy, caused a detente; the bazaars were soon opened and cordial relations between Persian officials and Consulates established. But upon conditions prevailing outside Kerman, His Excellency's arrival had little influence, nor had he the military or financial equipment to enable him to take any effective action to ameliorate the situation. All through the early part of the year caravan traffic from Bandar Abbas was suspended and the post from both sides maintained only with the most precarious irregularity. ~ Baluchistan was simultaneously in a state of turmoil, the ruling Balucli Khans paying no attention whatever to any central authority and practically parcelling out the country between themselves and appropriating the revenue thereof. In March, Bahadur-es-Sultaneh, ostensibly acting on behalf of the Got- ernor-General, left Bam with a large force for the purpose of collecting revenue in several districts, but he and his following realising the Governor-General's weak position found it an easy transition from the collection of revenue to general plunder, and on being called to task from Kerman, returned insolent answers and went into open rebellion. Collecting a large force at Baft he started^ to march on Kerman with the idea of expelling the Prince Governor and looting the town. The only semblance of force which the Governor-General had to oppose to them consisted of 40 tufangchis of his own guard, and a few Infantry, and by the middle of May the rebels had reached Eathabad, eight or nine miles from Kerman and threatened the town. At this stage the Governor-General, unsupported from Tehran, and with totally inadequate means of maintaining his position, or the safety of foreigners, threw in his hand and took bast in the British Consulate, on the 16th May. &gt; During the night following, His Majesty's Consul was instructed by His Majesty's Minister to bring the Governor-General to the telegraph and tnere an exchange of views took place, as the result of which the Minister of the Interior, on behalf of the Persian Government, promised the Governor-Genera the ^ necessary funds and official support, on his undertaking to resume his duties. This he hesitatingly agreed to do, and under the guidance of Colonel Haig, who practically assumed charge of the situation, eventually summoned up courage to attack the rebels and succeeded in breaking up their force. H e ^ e11 eventually effected the surrender and execution of two of the ringleaders, Mir® Husain Khan and Mirza Qasim. ^ The courage and judgment with which His Majesty's Consul coped inft the difficult situation into which he had been thrust by the incapacity ot Governor-General received the high commendation of His Majesty's Hinis er ^ and Lieutenant-Colonel Haig was shortly afterwards honoured with a ^ 0111 panionship of St. Michael and St. George for his services. The Amin-i-Azam was only able to hold his position for a few weeks longer and was dismissed in July, from which date until Colonel Haig proceedeFOE, THE YEAR 1912. 7 on leave at the end of September a general state of chaos prevailed and continued up to the end of the year. Mr. Newman, Manager of the Imperial Bank, held charge of British interests on Colonel Haig's departure pending the arrival of his successor, Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, from Bahrain, at the beginning of the New Year. The state of anarchy prevailing naturally had a most demoralising effect on Kerman trade with the result that bankruptcy real and fraudulent was very rife and some British traders were badly hit. As in 1911, the peace of this district was little disturbed by the advent Persian-Aiekran Coast. of .Afghans, and the grant to the principal cmers or permits tor the purchase or rmes on a restricted scale for their own use, served to minimise the resentment felt by the chiefs of the district at the stringent measures taken in connection with the Arms Traffic by His Majesty's Ships, who have been indebted to the Indo- European Telegraph Department for a great deal of useful intelligence and much painstaking work on shore, during the year. There is some reason to hope that, with the closure of Maskat as an arms entrepot, this district may before long revert to its normal condition of cheerful and innocuous anarchy. The Persian Government having long ceased to exercise any authority or take any interest in this region, it is the more a matter for congratulation that our local representatives have contrived to remain on friendly terms with most of the chiefs and keep the telegraph lino open throughout the year, in spite of the difficulties and embarrassments caused by the Arms Traffic. A reconnaissance survey for the a Karachi Extension Project' towards Bandar Abbas and Kerman was carried out in the spring under the orders of Railway Surveys. ^ Gov e r T n ™ ent ^ ^r. A. Johns, C.l.-b., assisted by Major L. P. Hopkins, E. E., and other officers. A careful survey was made of the alignment between Karachi and Grwadur* and from the latter point— {i) via Gaih, Bampur and Bam, or Sarbaz and Fahrah to Kerman ; (ii) from Bampur to the iShelag River near Eobat. It was estimated that the Gaih-Bampur-Bam route, which was recom mended in preference to the others, would cost Rs. 1,43,000 a mile for the broad and Rs. 1,13,000 for the metre guage. The problems of Arabistan, both political and commercial, have continued Arab is tan. demand their full share of attention from higher authority. The protocol of 1911 between Turkey and Persia providing for the formation at Constantinople of a Commission to delimit the Turko-Persian frontier, and for a reference Turko-Persian Frontier. to Hague Tribunal in case of failure to reach an agreement, revived this vexed question as a definite and urgent issue early in the year ; and in view of the possibility of a reference to the Hague it was considered necessary to re-examine the whole Arabistan frontier from the Dawairij to the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab both on the spot, and in the light of the archives of His Majesty's Government with a view to defining the present status quo and ascertaining how far it was based on ancient custom or could be justified on historical grounds. In response to an urgent enquiry from His Majesty's Foreign Office as to the precise distance of the locally recognised frontier west of Hawizeh, the Resident proceeded there via Ahwaz accompanied by a native surveyor kindly lent by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, visiting Shuaib on the Karkhah, the westernmost point of the Turko-Persian frontier as locally observed, and returning to Mohammerah via Kishk-i-Hawizeh, Kishk-i-Basri and Diaiji, where the frontier approached the Shatt-el-Arab ; the frontier from Hawizeh to the Shatt-el-Arab was carefully examined and a map prepared showing the precise location of the locally observed boundary.g PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT T.-p,, tenant A. T. Wilson was placed on special dutyinthe same cou tt ectio a in June and visited Hawizeh, in company with Lieutenant Bigby-Be ste , ^ I M in order to fix astronomically the position of that centre upon % correct location of which relatively to Ahwaz some doubt had been tiro» n bv recent surveys. The opportunity wus also taken to ascertain the precise position of thJfrontier to the_North-West of Hawiieh as locally observed, A, a result of the above investigations dealing respectively with the frontier, south and north of Hawizeh, and of a further examination of the frontier in tie vicinitv of the Shatt-el-Arab. His Majesty's Government were placed in pr®, sion of maps showing the precise position of_ the locally observed frontier, together with detailed arguments in support of it, on receipt of which, and after a full survey of the historical and juridical aspects ot the question, a memorandum accompanied by a map was addressed to the Porte^ explaining in detail the lie of the frontier as locally recognised and expressing the hope of His Maiesty's Government that the Porte would consent thereto, in return for which the former intimated their readiness to use their influence with the Persian Government and the Shaikh of Mohammerah and, subject to certain conditions, to induce these latter to recognise Turkish sovereignty oyer the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab. Amongst these conditions were included stipulations that the arrangements proposed by His Majesty's Government for a Riverain Commission were to be accepted by Turkey, and that the Shaikh of Mohammerah was to continue in full enjoyment of his existing proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory. Up to the end of the year, for reasons explained elsewhere, no reply had been received to the above proposals, but it was understood that the Porte was inclined to regard them favourably, and it is to be hoped that during the coming year a definite solution will be attained. The Turkish Government at all events are now under no misapprehension as to the views of His Majesty's Government upon the subject, for on May 10th, some months before addressing the aboTe memorandum, the Porte was warned that persistence in her present pretensions in regard to the frontier in the Arabistan region might react unfavourably upon the adjustment of the respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf, ''in view of the close relations existing between His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh of Mohammerah. ,, The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has made steady progress during the year ^ p and may now be said to have reached ompany. the productive stage, refined oil having been placed in small quantities on the local market; thus from the local point of view, the position of the Company is decidedly satisfactory. His Majesty's Government, however, viewed with considerable anxiety the prospect, which there is reason to think, is by no means remote, that the Augjo- Persian Oil Company, which is at present entirely British, might be forced by commercial pressure to come to terms with and be virtually absorbed by the Shell Transport Company, which is under foreign control, a consummation which could only result in the increase of foreign interests in the Persian Gu , and a considerable enhancement of the price of oil, a matter of much concern to the British Admiralty. The question is closely bound up with the prospects of the concession for oil fields in Mesopotamia being obtained by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who as Concessionaires on the other side of the border in Persia, would greatly handicapped, were the Turkish fields, at all events in the wilayatsoi Baghdad and Musul, to be in the hands of a rival concern. TTj 9 The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were accordingly supported by Majesty's Government in their application to the Turkish authorities fa a c ®j cession, and negotiations at Constantinople were in active progress at tue of the year. The progress of the Mohammerah-Khoremmabad project has been ^ Railways in Arabistan. 011 elsewhere ; when it materialises, ^e g( « u -u • i undertakings given by the ^ 1 . 11 , j Sultaneh m regard to the lands through which the line may pass, will ^ frnm ^ ^ 0 P tioi!l that His Majesty's Government haveseW e StLaikil of Mohammerah in regard to the Khor Musa will enableFOR THE YEAE 1912. 9 regulate the allotment of the foreshore of this harbour to our own satisfaction, should occasion arise. From the accounts given by Major Haworth and Captain Grey of the 01 v j ■*-» 111 • • strained relations which have existed ai an a lan. throughout the year between the Shaikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtiari Khans, it will be apparent that the authority of the leaders of both parties is likely to be impaired and the peace of their territories in danger of annual disturbance, unless some permanent settlement can be reached, a consummation which the efforts of His Majesty's Eepresentatives at Tehran and on the spot have hitherto failed to achieve : the peace of Arabistan was substantially undisturbed during the year, but this was due less to the occurrence of a detent between the parties than to the continued loyalty of all the Arab tribes to their titular head. Captain Grey's report deals primarily with the Bakhtiari, Laristan and Ahwaz Kuhgelu provinces. The two last named districts were in their normal condition of anarchy, whilst during the summer months, the Bakhtiari country was little better owing to constant Kuhgelu raids, in which Bakhtiari tribesmen appear to have participated con amove. The Ahwaz-Ispahan road was completely closed from June to September, but losses of British goods only totalled £1,430 during the year, Messrs. Lynch Brothers having received timely news of impending disturbances in June and having stopped forwarding from either end. The quantity of goods carried over the road shows, however, a considerable increase over the figures for 1911 almost equalling the totals for 1910, but the rate of hire continues to exhibit an r upward tendency and stands at a figure which greatly hampers British trade with Ispahan. It is satisfactory to note that the Oil Company's pipe line laid by a firm of Glasgow contractors and British Engineers has worked uninterruptedly throughout the year without a single leak or burst: the line is laid through most difficult country and its working and that of the pumping stations reflect great credit on all concerned. The passing history of Maskat continues to centre in the negotiations with MaBkat the Sultan and with France for the sup pression or the limitation of the Arms Traffic and the measures taken by us meanwhile for k eeping it in practical check. It is satisfactory to be able to record that during the past year there has been a considerable advance towards the goal desired, thanks mainly to the satisfactory and co-operative attitude steadfastly maintained by His Highness the Sultan. The position at the end of last year was that the Sultan had accepted the Government of India's proposals in principle, in consideration of the addition of one lakh per annum to his subsidy and a payment of a further lakh cash down, intended to represent compensation for loss and inconvenience which His Highness had been incidentally put to by our operations against the traffic during the last few years. The Political Eesident spent the month of May at Maskat engaged with the Sultan and the Political Agent in working out the details of the warehouse scheme. A good deal of difficulty was experienced at first owing to the difficulty which His Highness experienced in coping with the somewhat unwieldy task presented by the scheme as a whole with its numerous intricate working details, and was inclined to imagine pitfalls and international complications on every side. It consequently became necessary to deal with the subject in instalments suitable for His Highness's consumption, and on these lines the negotiations pro ceeded much more satisfactorily. Once committed to the scheme, and confident of our intention to give him unequivocal support in the execution of it, he made little further difficulty over details and accepted the rules drafted for him, subject to a few modifications which were on the whole reasonable. After a warning notice, promulgated on the 3rd June, intimating the inauguration of the special warehouse for arms after a period of three months, the arrangement was duly brought into force, and though up to the end of the year the French Government have maintained their refusal to accept its provisions on the part of their nationals, their attitude has continued to become less uncompromising and20 PERSIAN GrTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT there is every hope that before long a satisfactory understanding with His Maiestv's Government and the Sultan will be reached. Meanwhile the public seem to have accepted the fact that the warehouse arrangement has come to stay and that the days of the smuggling traffic on which they have fattened for so many years past are numbered. There is, of course, a considerable stock of arms in the public and in private warehouses in Maskat which has to be got rid of, and the publication of the notice regarding the warehouse scheme naturally caused manufacturers at home to endeavour to dump at Maskat the supplies which they already had on hand but it will be seen from the Political Agent's report that towards the end of the year imports began to fall off in a marked way. It has been decided to con- tinue blockade operations until the negotiations with France haye been brought to a head, but it is found that the smuggling fraternity no longer risk transporting large consignments and have resorted to passing the arms over in driblets which are jettisoned on the approach of a man-of-war. This development has made the task of His Majesty's Navy all the more laborious and heart-breaking, as comparatively few large captures have rewarded the elaborate search of a large number of native craft. From the public point of view, however, it matters little whether the arms are jettisoned by the smugglers themselves or consigned to the deep after capture by His Majesty's Ships; in either case the object of their labours is achieved. For the present their chief attentions are still mainly centred in the upper part of the Gulf. The Arms Traffic question having continued to monopolize the time and energies of the Sultan and the Political Agent, the pursuit of other important problems connected with Maskat have necessarily remained in abeyance, but one or two items call for brief mention. Firstly, the application of the Indian Pilgrim Ships Act of 1895 to Maskat and to the Persian Coast and Islands wag made operative somewhat hurriedly at the beginning of the pilgrim season, and the bulk of work in connection with its enforcement will fall upon Maskat, which is now a compulsory port of call for Pilgrim Ships. At the end of the year, in connection with the comprehensive scheme of lighting and buoying undertaken by the British Government, the question of the Lighting and Buoying, precise site for a lighthouse at the entrance to the Gulf was under lively consideration, there being some divergence of opinion as to whether the point should be decided on purely navigational grounds or in connection with the strategic necessities of our position at the mouth of the Upper Gulf; the matter was undecided at the end of the year, but the trend of opinion was in favour of the selection of Little Quoin. The general situation of this coast has altered little from last year, and no Trucial Oman. measures on the part of Government, _ ~ either for the introduction of the telegraph shape 1 * 8tren gtlioning of our position in any other way, have yet taken Bw7 hi !?^ 0 l th - bus ^ ai noiig the ruling Shaikhs, the Chiefs of short peSdstf JSr ^ died UIiex P ectedl y in Ae prime of life after ? oast ^ achieved unpleasant notoriety during the year in connection We S th^Z^V 14 is cohered, owing Jthe non-possumus att.- trade f fected tha tt to any deliberate wish to encourage tie hlocLde^he S i de ^ el0pmeilt is tlla t the effective measures taken to counled with flip , oas ^ and to deal with dhows carrying arms up the Guli P. .

The Abu Musa oxide case in dispute with the German Government has made no progress during the year, our counter case having remained under the consideration of the German Government; but it is understood that they are inclined to accept a friendly compromise and there is consequently some hope that the coming year will see the final settlement of this long drawn out dispute. It is an instructive result of experience and one of which it is important p , . - for higher authority to take cognizance, that the fact of being suitably hqused con duces greatly to the health and peace of mind of political officers serving under the naturally trying conditions of the Gulf, and to the consequent popularity of one appointment as compared with another. Thus, under former conditioas at Bandar Abbas, when our representative inhabited an inconvenient Persian built house at Naband, it was never possible to keep an officer there more than two years, and he generally suffered in health and had to leave before that. But since the construction of a thoroughly sound and comfortable residence by the Government of India, the terrors of Bandar Abbas have disappeared and the present incumbent has been able to live in health and reasonable contentment with his family, and willingly faces the prospect of a 3-years sojourn. On the other hand Bahrain, owing mainly to its unsatisfactory house accommodation, has succeeded to the position of the un popularity formerly held by Bandar Abbas. 'No officer seems to be able to exist there without suffering in bodily and mental health, and it is certainly nowadays the least agreeable appointment under the Kesidency. It is greatly to be hoped, therefore, that the Government of India will accept the suggestions put forward daring the current year for the construction of new and sound agency premises in place of the waterlogged buildings now in use. The year has been essentially one of ' mark time ' at Bahrain so far as visible progress is concerned. Nevertheless the two most important current questions affecting Bahrain, namely the improvement of the cargo landing arrangements and the introduction of an Order in Council have advanced con siderably on the record and are on the point of materialising. Questions directly or indirectly bearing on our relations with Turkey, or on issues in negotiation with Turkey, have necessarily been in abeyance owing to the existehce of a state of war between Turkey and Italy and Turkey and the Balkans ; but there is every hope that the coming year will see the inauguration of the Wireless System and the Order in Council, as well as the acceptance by the Shaikh, on the authoritative advice of the Government of India, of a more efficient arrangement for the handling, storage and delivery of cargo. The contemporary history of Kuwait maintains the satisfactory character . of which appreciation was expressed last uwait ' year. The effect that he has purchased more property on the Shatt-el-Arab, and many other indications, show that Shaikh Mubarak's affairs have continued to prosper steadily in the atmosphere of our friendship and support, and he certainly repays cultivation by the sage and enlightened attitude with which he approaches matters of politics and busi ness, and the readiness with which he modifies it to meet the requirements of advancing civilization. For example, while the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast and Bahrain were full of apprehensions when the contemplated creation of wireless stations was broached to them. Shaikh Mubarak fell in with the idea without the slightest hesitation. Again, he spontaneously invited Government to undertake a water-supply scheme for him and has received without demur an American Missionary and12 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT his wife from the Arabian Mission, in addition to the Medical Missionary he agreed to receive with our concurrence three years ago. UI11 He has also made welcome a European representatiye on behalf of Messrs Grav Paul and Company, while continuing to reject the perseyering endeavoursof Messrs. Wonckhaus to insinuate a German representative of their fi rin)at Kuwait. The K.C.I.E. which was bestowed on him in the Delhi Durbar Honours Gazette was greatly appreciated by him and his people, and went far to consolj him for the disappointment which he felt at not having an opportunity of being present himself. As will be seen from the Political Agent's report His Es- cellency Eear Admiral the Hon'ble Sir A. Bethell^ co-operated most heartily in making the utmost of the occasion arranged for its bestowal on behalf of His Majesty the King-Emperor. His friendship with the Shaikh of Mohammerah has continued to become closer knit, and they consult each other in all important matters affecting their interests; moreover they are gradually increasing their territorial and moral influence among the riverain communities of the Shatt-el-Arab. This steady consolidation of their interests is an interesting feature of the politics of the Upper Gulf, and as long as it is based, as it is now, on the common intimacy of their relations with the British Government, it is undoubtedly an useful asset and an element of strength to our political position in the Gulf. It w r as somewhat tantalising that the Danish traveller Herr Eaunkaier m enabled by a combination of circumstances in his favour to enter Central Arabia, while it is closed to explorers of our own nationality, but I think we may con sole ourselves with the hope that a change is coming over the face of Central Arabian politics and that before long the shifting of the kaleidoscope and per severance in the tactful cultivation of friendly personal relations with the tribal notables which the Political Agent pursues, will before long enable His Majesty's Government to remove the embargo and consider Central Arabia open to ap proved English explorers.

Gaptain Birdwood in consequence reverted to First Assistant, whilst Captain A. T.

Smart relieved Mr. Acting Consul G. G. Knox at Shiraz in January and was himself relieved by Major W. F. T. O'Connor, C.I.E., in November, when he proceeded to Tehran to officiate as Oriental Secre tary in His Majesty's Legation. Monsieur Dmitrieff continued to hold charge of the Eussian Consulate- General throughout the year. Foreign Interests. 0 ^ Aguiah Bey held charge of the Ottoman Consulate and Dr. Listemann of the German Consulate. Mr. A. H. Wright, Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia,, continued to hold charge of the Norwegian Vice-Consulate. His Majesty's Consul-General continued to hold charge of the French Vice-Consulate throughout the year, and also of Dutch interests. Some doubt on the latter subject having arisen in connection with the nomination of a new French Vice-Consul^ the Netherlands Minister intimated to His Majesty's Legation in October that he regarded His Majesty's Eesident at Bushire as holding charge of Dutch interests qua British Consul-General, and not in his capacity of Gerant of the French Vice-Consulate. The question of the representation of Dutch interests in the Persian Gulf region by His Majesty's Consul-General and British Political officers generally came under consideration towards the close of the year. Mirza Ali Muhammad Khan, Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh, was Governor of the „ . _ . , Gulf Ports throughout the year, though Persian Officials. ,-1 , 0 ,. . 6 1 •&gt; ,V there were not wanting signs/towards the close of the year, that his immediate predecessor, the Darya Begi, was endea vouring, not unnaturally, and not altogether unsuccessfully, to make the Muwaggar's position untenable, and to enlist in the interests of his own candi dature the support of the Administrator-General of Customs and intriguers at Tehran, such as the Moin-ut-Tujjar, who although he had supported the Muwaggar's candidature for his present appointment had found him insuffi ciently subservient to his ends and interests in the Gulf. It was also noted that the Swedish officers of the gendarmerie who arrived in Bushire in Novem ber displayed a strong bias against the Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh, due to the fact that certain of the Darya Begi's old retainers were attached to them. J The Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh's name was mentioned for this post early in the . »« year, but it was for some time uncertain Governor-General of Pars. ixi i- • , , , , , whether his appointment would be con firmed, and whether he would proceed to his post. He eventually left TehranPERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT in the latter part of August arriving at Shiraz on October 16th, witw incident, though a party of 80 sowars sent from Shiraz to meet him attacked by Buwair Ahmadis at Khaneh Khurreh and fled losing their b; rifles and ammunition. He did not create a favourable impression on first ^ appointment, Ms fframs to local Persian notables conveying an impression of weakness, Mr. Smart, who had known him at Tabriz, was inclined to consider him vw civilized for so turbulent a province as Ears, though he believed that, if not pressed from Tehran, he would be guided by honest judgment of the local situation rather than by prejudice: his only personal connection with the province was the fact that his family owned the greater part of the Mashhad. i-Murghab district between Ispahan and^ Shiraz. His Majesty's Minister ^as not, however, unfavourably impressed with; his bearing, once he had definitely decided to take up the appointment, and up to the end of the year he appears to have succeeded in making good his expressed intention of holding aloof from either of the factions in Ears. Although from his conversation in Tehran lie seems to have started with anti-Kawami prejudices, he refrained from oyert action against Kawam-ul-Mulk, who had been acting as Deputy Goveraor since the departure of Nizam-es-Sultaneh. His attitude towards the other party was facilitated by the resignation of Sardar Ihtisham from the Ilkhani. ship of the Kashgai, which enabled the Governor-General to reappoint Sowlet- ed-Dowleh to that post in December, without, hpwever, inviting him to take charge of the road, or take part in any way in the administration of the province. The Darya Begi accompanied Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh as Commander of the military forces of the Governor-General: his attempts to cause difficulties between Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh and the Governor-General have already been noticed. Though inconvenient they were not unnatural having regard to the humiliating circumstances under which he was displaced by the Muwaggar-ed- Dowleh, two years ago. At the end of the year the presence of his old enemy at Borasjun was causing the Governor some anxiety, which will doubtless increase until Naoroz has safely passed. Mirza Ahmed Khan, Masud-es-Sultan, held the post of Eoreign Office Karguzftr Agent at Bushire throughout the year; his conduct was conciliatory and gave no ground of complaint. Meshedi Abdul Rasul continued in the post of Kalantar and Chief of Kaiantar and Kadkhuda. P 01 * 06 of Bushire until the beginning of t &gt; November when he was arrested by tne Governor. The dismissal of this troublesome but influential celebrity was a source of satisfaction to the Residency as he had shown himself to be a thorough rascal m everv way, and both in the time of the Darya Begi and of the present Governor we had repeatedly had occasion to complain of his hostility and obstruction in connection with Residency cases, whilst there was no doubt tnat ne was hand in glove with the arms smuggling element in Bushire and the surrounding country.

The Belgian Customs Department showed at one time a disposition to take the side of the Kalantar in opposition to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. This attitude on their part could only have been due to their own hostility to the Governor, seeing that they had only just before complained loudly of the Kalantar's proceedings. Their support of the Kalantar did not, however, take active shape and no opposition was raised when the Governor appointed Ahdur Beza as Kalantar in Abdur Easul's place. The duties of Eais-i-Nazmieh or Chief of Police were nominally performed Amin-i-Maiiyeii and Rais-i-Nazmieh. throughout the year by the Kalantar. The post of Eais, or Amin-i-Maliyeh or (Einance Agent) which had been in practical abeyance since the previous year was abolished in October, when the duties of Agent to the Treasurer-General were formally assumed by the Belgian Provincial Director of Customs. This development is dealt with else where in this report: the salary of the Amin-i-Maliyeh appears to have been distributed amongst the Customs staff, but no definitely responsible Persian revenue official was nominated ad hoc even in a subordinate capacity under the Belgian Customs Director. Monsieur A. Constant held the post of Provincial Director of Customs throughout the year, except for a period of four months from August to Novem ber, during which he was on leave in Europe, his place being temporarily taken by Monsieur Zwinne, an official whose vagaries while at Bandar Abbas are dealt with in Captain Biscoe's report. Monsieur Constant, who is a man of some ability, maintained friendly and conciliatory relations with the Residency throughout the period under report, and on his departure on leave His Majesty's Minister, at the Resident's suggestion, expressed to the Administrator- General his appreciation of Monsieur Constant's friendly attitude. In so far as purely Customs matters were concerned, the doings of the Belgian Adminis tration at Bushire call for no special notice. The year was marked by no outrages such as have occurred in previous years, and no difficulties worth recording arose regarding Customs matters between the Administration and the Residency. Smuggling, however, continues with little abatement. It is as agents to the Treasurer-General (M. Mornard) that the activities of the Belgian Administration have been a matter of some concern during the year. The general aspect of this question and its effect upon our interests in southern Persia has already been dealt with in the Review to this Report, and it is only necessary here to refer to the effect of this development on Ears and Bushire. In May 1912 M. Mornard invited M. Constant to proceed to Shiraz as Farg Einance Agent there, but the proposal was declined by that gentleman as not being within his contract, the appointment being also regarded as a somewhat precarious one. Later on M. Stas, who had been brought back from retire ment to act in a financial capacity at Kerman was transferred to Shiraz, M. LeCoffre, a British subject, replacing him at Kerman. The Governor-General made no secret of his distrust and dislike of Belgians generally for Treasury employ. In view of these and other considerations, and of the critical situation at the end of this year. His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz (Major O'Connor) strongly advocated the appointment, if possible, of a suit able Englishman as Treasury Agent, whose guidance and advice would, he anticipated, be much more readily accepted by the Governor-General and who would, of course, work in close co-operation with the Consulate. It was re presented that neither the Persian Government nor M. Mornard could reason ably object to being asked to make such an appointment, seeing that the administration of Ears was being, as will be shown elsewhere, practically financed by His Majesty's Government. It was held, however, that a demand for the employment of an Englishman was not politically feasible, and that we16 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT must make the best of M. Stas ia the hope that he would fiud it the best policy to work in accord with His Majesty s representative. The activities of the Belgian Treasury Department, in so far as thev affected British interests, may be cmi Bushire • sidered under two heads :— (i) interference with the administration of Governor of the Gulf Ports • (ii) extension of administrative control to other departments, sucli as Posts, Telegraphs, etc. The latter question has been dealt witk elsewhere. Under the old regime the Governor used to farm the income both from Customs and Land Revenue, from the Central interference wia tLe Governor of the Government, and make what he could from Gulf Ports. ^j ie con t rac ^ Since 1900, the Governor has had nothing to do with the collection of Customs, whilst, as regards revenue, the Belgian Administration has for some time been entrusted with revenue collec tion from certain districts where it is easiest to collect, the Governor being charged with the remainder. As a charge upon, or in compensation for, the Revenue thus collected by the Customs, the Governor is entitled to receire from them a regular monthly payment, which was formerly fixed at Tomtms 15 ,000, but recently reduced to 11,200 Tomans a month. This payment was arbitrarily suspended by the Customs from 21st March 1912, ostensibly on the pretext that the Imperial Bank of Persia objected to the payment as being contrary to the 1911 loan agreement. On its being made clear, however, that the payment was due out of Revenue and not out of Customs receipts, the Bank withdrew their objection, it being stipulated, however, that Customs and Revenue accounts were to be separated and that Customs receipts were not to be used, as has been the custom, to make good deficits in Revenue collections in order to effect this payment, unless the Bank's prior claims on Customs revenue had already been satisfied. The pay ment to the Governor was, therefore, resumed in July, but only to be stopped again in September, on this occasion at the direct but secret suggestion of the officiating Customs Director, M. Zwinne (although ostensibly on cordial terms with His Excellency) on the grounds that the Governor's attitude towards the Belgian Treasury Administration was improper and his accounts for the previous year irregular. M. Zwinne had not, however, the moral courage to inform the Governor frankly of his views and recommendations, but had repeatedly given him and the Resident also to understand that it was the Bank who were responsible for the stoppage of funds, and that the latter step was not taken at his recommendation. In October, M. Mornard addressed a somewhat offensively worded telegram direct to the Governor, taxing him with behaving ' like a rebel' and making a number of vague charges against him in order to justify his action in stop ping nis monthly allowance. Asked by the Governor to explain the consideia- tions which gave rise to such a telegram, Monsieur Zwinne gave an evasiw reply ; meanwhile some one took steps to have the text of M. Mornard's telegram to the Governor, of which M. Zwinne had received a copy .simultaneonsty circulated m Eushire and neighbourhood. On being invited unofficially liy » Resident to explain the reasons for his duplex attitude he delivered, undei instructions from M. Mornard, to whom he had thought it necessary to refer, a message from the latter affording no replv to the Resident's query, J® conveying the irreyelant assurance that Belgians were not anti-Bng», ™ m Sl 0 w y i SUp ?T Se n M ' Zwinno left for Bandar Abbas a day or twoafte ' , y. ; Constant, who, while taking much the same line as Lttw r to the Governor, was full of scorn for M- methods ot dealing with the question. n r^V t0VVa ^ e 0 - his emol uments by the Customs afforded the Governor» ' Alafi ' leT}r i * ems irregular taxation, such as 'KaJantar ^ Treaiv in T lm P os ^ amounting to ' Eahdari ' and as such contrary , Wm to nl P T f ?

At the close of the year M. Constant evolved a long memorandum in criticism of the details of the statement of account rendered by the Governor, which, if the statements made in it were well founded, would constitute a severe indictment on. His Excellency's financial regime. M. Constant was informed by the Resident that in his opinion, if the Customs Administration desired to use this as a means of impeaching the Governor, the only fair course was to give him a copy of it at the same time as it reached Monsieur Mornard and give him an opportunity to meet the allegations made in it. It remains to be seen what the sequel will be. Captain C. B. McConaghy, held the post of Chief Quarantine n j rj ,, tt t Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf Quarantine and Residency Hospital. i j ii o yj, u.j.j. throughout the year. The serious epidemic of plague which again visited the Island, resulting in 729 deaths out of 965 recorded cases, amounting to a mortality of between 3 or 4 per cent, of the population, is dealt with in Appendix I. It had a most prejudicial effect on the prosperity of the Island. Many families were completely wiped out, and there was a large emigration to Mohammerah, Basrah, and elsewhere, which appears likely to result in a permanent diminution of the population. The epidemic spread to Ahmadi and even as far as Kamarij. It is satisfactory to note, however, that the Sanitary Council paid a cordial tribute to the good work performed by Captain McConaghy and his staff in the endeavour to combat the outbreak; and that the Government of India were also pleased to express their appreciation. The readiness evinced by the community to take inoculation this year in contrast to past experience was a particularly noteworthy and satisfactory feature.

For the greater part of the year, until December in fact, the districts of Dashti and Dashtistan were without a Governor even in name: no revenue was collected and rival factions were able to devote then: selves to the prosecu tion of time honoured feuds, unhampered by any controlling authority. Traffic on the Bushire-Shiraz road was on several occasions subjected to prolonged interruptions or to forcible diversions to execrable and little used tracks, in order to avoid passing through the areas of conflict.PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT The principal rival elements were ranged as follows :— (1) Zair Khadhar of Tangistan in alliance with Ahmed Khan nf Angali against Shaikh Husein of Chahkntah. 01 (2) Agha Haidar and brothers of Ohaghadak and Tul-i-Siah against tb inhabitants of Buneh-i-Gaz who were aided by Zair Khadliarof Tangistan. (3) Ghazanfar-es-Sultaneh of Borasjun in alliance with Nur Muhammad Khan of Daliki against Ismail Khan of Shabankareh, father-iu. law of the former. (4) Nur Muhammad Khan of Daliki and his brother Husein Be? of Kunar Takhteh against Mulla Kuli of Kumarij supported 0 by Ismail Khan of Shabankareh. (5) Ismail Khan of Shabankareh and Muhammad Khan, Kashkuli against Agha Sardar of Khisht and other Khisht elements sup ported by the Daliki Khans. (6) The late Khurshid Beg of Kumarij against Ali Muhammad the Kumarij outlaw aided by Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli. (7) Nasir-ud-Diwan, Kalantar of Kazerun, against Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli. (8) Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, Kashgai, with Ayyaz Kikha Darashuri, against former's half brother Zeigham-ed-Dowleh supported by other Kashgai Kalanfars and Kawam-ul-Mulk. Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh announced, in December, that he had appointed the Governor of the Gulf Ports to the governance of Dashti and Dashtistan, but the latter declined to accept the responsibility unless provided with a force for maintaining his authority in collecting revenue. Meanwhile the Governor General's communications and his attitude towards local Khans betrayed such ignorance of the elementary facts of the situation as to occasion much scornful comment amongst local notables who showed no disposition to co-operate. The Nizam-es-Sultaneh, whose doings are related in the Mohammerah Administration Report, has not figured in the local politics of Ears during the year under report: the proscription against him was removed, at the interven tion of His Majesty^ Legation, in M arch, and he shortly afterwards pledged his Ears properties (Khisht 6 dang, Daliki 3 dang, Zirah 3 dang, Nabardeh o dang) to Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah. The latte^ endeavoured to collect the revenues of these districts, but with only partial success. The revenue of the village of Zirah above mentioned in the district of the same name, had een pledged together with other lands to the Russian Bank in Tehran by the JNizam, and was one of the items redeemed by the Imperial Bank of Persia, under circumstances detailed in the Mohammerah report.

It was deemed necessary as a precautionary measure, and in anticipation of any further military measures that might be indicated to land a small force at Bushire, thus freeing His Majesty 's ships from the guarding that port. One hundrod and sixty men of the 79th Carnatic Infantry were accordingly landed on December 30th and after this 100 men on the 2nd January, a naval brigade of 200 men were held in readiness to land if necessity arose, and 200 hired mules were retained at Bushire for use as transport should it appear that immediate action was imperatively required. It soon became clear, however, that this was not the case and the hired mules were dismissed, but the infantry retained at Bushire. Accommodation for this detachment was fortunately obtained almost at once, the fin^ block of buildings erected by the late Malik-ut-Tujjar at Eeshire being leased at a very reasonable figure by the Residency for their use. The 79th Carnatic Infantry were relieved in Novem ber by a detachment of the 2nd Queen Victoria's Own Eajput Light Infantry, without occasioning any remark or incident, indeed there is reason to think that the Governor of the Gulf Ports has been inwardly much relieved and fortified by their presence, and it was popularly believed that had they not been stationed here, the Tangistani tribesmen of Zair Khadhar would have made the arrest of Abdur Rasul, Kalantar, an excuse for coming in force to the Island, a course which would almost certainly have resulted in further distur bances, such as occurred in 1909 and 1910. A squadron of the Central India Horse remained at Bushire throughout the year. The Government of India suggested the despatch of a battalion of Infantry , ^ ,,. . to Bushire as a preliminary measure, with Proposals for obtaining reparation. . , . x . ,, V, . F a view to seizing the Customs which should be retained, the surplus receipts over and above what was due for the loan being kept as a contribution towards the claim to be made upon the Persian Government ; they also indicated the necessity for a blockade of the coast to prevent the tribes from obtaining supplies of ammunition, the latter step, was taken by the Naval Commander-in-Chief early in January : the occupa tion of Bandar Abbas was also suggested. As regards punitive measures against the offending tribes, the Government of India considered that action in this direction would be extremely difficult and hazardous, but they intimated that should the local situation at Shiraz render the relief of the troops at Shiraz and Ispahan imperative, they might find themselves compelled to send a force of 5,000 men to bring away the troops now in the interior, together with the members of the Shiraz Consulate and any British subjects who might desire to avail themselves of the opportu nity in order to leave Shiraz. They were opposed on military and general grounds to the despatch via Lingah or Bandar Abbas of a battery and battalion of Infantry which had been suggested by His Majesty's Acting Consul, Shiraz, and supported by His Majesty's Minister, but proposed to hold Bushire until the Persian Government had given satisfactory redress. In connection with the above proposals, the India Office pointed out that the despatch of troops to Shiraz would have to be postponed until the force there was actually in danger, and that the occupation of Bushire would not necessarily afford a sufficient lever to move the Persian Government to efficient action. It was further pointed out that at Shiraz, Ispahan and Yezd there were Consular Representatives and subjects of other Powers, including Russia, and that in the event of our withdrawal we must contemplate the contin gency that steps for their protection would be taken by Russia, the appearance of whose troops in the neutral sphere could not fail greatly to affect the policy of the Anglo-Russian Convention as regards Persia. The Russian Government had in fact already adumbrated the possibility of their having to strengthen their Ispahan escort in order to protect Russian caravans passing from Ispahan to Shiraz and Tehran respectively. The Persian Government simultaneously urged His Majesty's Government not to take any drastic measures but to leave them to deal effectively with the situation20 PERSIAN GtlLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT themselves, alleging that heavy casual jes had already been m&amp;cted o a Pe^ •'bv the improper use of Maxim guns ' on the occasion of the attack oa Mr Smart, and further, that those responsible had been pursued and arrested by Muhammad All Khan, Kashkuli, statements tor which there was not the smallest founclation. His Majesty's Minister expressed himself very reluctant to contempl^g the evacuation of Pars, though in view of the many objections to wWchfe alternative courses were open, lie would nave been m favour of such a course were it not for the size of the force which would be necessary m order to effect this It would seem regrettable, he said, that so great a Military display sliould be undertaken merely to result in the abandonment of our interests in Ears, His Majesty's Acting Consul at Shiraz, however, at first anticipated very serious disorders in the spring and, whilst unable to prophesy whether this would result in an attack on troops and Europeans in Shiraz, considered that such a contingency could not advisedly be ignored. On 16th January, His Majesty's Foreign Office telegraphed their decision to evacuate Shiraz and requested the Government of India to submit proposals as to the composition and size of the force necessary to effect this after consultation with His Majesty's Minister. The evacuation of Ispahan and Yezd was also contemplated, but was decided v to be unnecessary. On 23rd January, the Government of India replied urging reconsideration of the question of withdrawal, it was pointed out that the situation had eased considerably since the alternative of evacuation was adumbrated and that the Shiraz detachment could, should need arise, return via Ispahan and Ahwaz. The Government of India were inclined to think that the seriousness of the situation and the probability of dangerous developments had been overestimated by local officers, and expressed the belief that danger could be averted by timely negotiations with the tribes concerned and by other measures which tliey considered should first be attempted. Doubts were expressed as to the wisdom of withdrawing our Consulate, as such a step would create a vacuum of which others were likely to take advantage, to our detriment. The Government of India stated that not less than a war division less one brigade would be required to effect a withdrawal from Shiraz, and that its despatch and possible retention would have an injurious effect in Muhammadan opinion and would afford a fresh pretext for Russian action in thC/North. They strongly recommended that negotiations be opened (as had already been suggested by them on January 11th) with tribal chiefs for the preservation of order on the road. In pursuance of this scheme a regiment of Native Infantary would be sent to Bushire, and it would then be explained to the chiefs concerned that His Majesty's Government were extremely anxious to avoid intervention, that they had no designs against any of them ; that sucli outrages obviously could not be tolerated ; but that, before resorting to extensiTe operations, His Majesty's Government offered to them the opportunity to give us satisfaction for the recent outrage and to enter into a direct compact witniis for the maintenance of security .on the road. It was contemplated to subsidise the Chiefs concerned, in return for which they should keep up guards on a regular roster and regular pay, a Special Assistant to the Eesident being appos ed to supervise the arrangements; it was also suggested that in order to asso ciate the Persian Government with these measures, Swedish Officers woul ^ employed to assist the British officer in supervising the road levies. Before negotiations could commence, however, it was considered necessary that the Khan of Borasjun should be eliminated or punished, and astrio blockade of the Persian littoral maintained. As regards the vindication of our position vis-a-vis the Persian Government) it was suggested that steps should be taken to exact from the Persian Govern ment reparation for the recent incidents and the cost of the measures propoj As a preliminary step in this direction, the Government of India suggest a a Regiment of Infantry and a Mountain Battery should be located 111 i ish enclosure at Basidu: their presence, it was considered, was ^ es A m connection with measures being taken for the suppression of the APOIl THE TEAR 1912. 21 Traffic, and would lend weight to our communications to the Persian Govern ment, whilst if further pressure were needed, it could be conveniently applied by the occupation by the same force of the Kishm position. His Majesty's Minister considered this scheme so greatly preferable to the alternative of evacuation as to be well worth a trial and expressed the hope that effect should be given to them at once. These proposals were further developed by the Government of India in a telegram, dated 5th February, to the Home Government, which had up to that date come to no decision regarding the despatch of troops to the Gulf, which was an essential preliminary to the inception of the proposed negotiations. It was represented that our objects were threefold :— (1) To get the individual or individuals responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart to settle accounts with us. (2) To induce the headmen who exercise control on the road to come to an agreement with us for the maintenance of order thereon. (3) To discount the risk of dangerous tribal fighting in the spring in the neighbourhood of Shiraz. The Khan of Borasjun having been first dealt with, it was proposed, as soon as troops embarked from India, to issue a full press communique both in London and Calcutta, and to make a communication through the Resident at Baghdad to the Ulema of Mesopotamia to induce them to exert their influence in order to allay apprehensions of Great Britain's intentions: the advisability of pressing the Persian Government to telegraph in the same sense was suggested for consideration, and it was further proposed that a brief exposition of British intentions and policy should be issued from Bushire in Persian under the signature of His Majesty's Oonsul-General to the principal headmen. The ground being prepared as above, His Majesty's Oonsul-General would then address the headmen concerned in the attack on Mr. Smart, and those interested in the road, explaining our intentions and inviting them to meet his representatives at a given rendezvous if they wished for a peaceful settlement. If the headmen responded, negotiations were contemplated on the following lines:— (1) Each individual would be required to undertake to co-operate generally for the maintenance of order on the road. (2) To make himself responsible to us for a particular section of road and to supply a certain number of guards of good character on monthly pay to be paid under supervision of our own Superin tending Officer. (3) To pay compensation for all British goods robbed within their section. (4) To sell supplies at fair rates to be arranged in consultation with our Superintending Officer and to abstain absolutely from the levy of transit dues. « On our part we should guarantee, as long as they fulfilled their obligations, a regular subsidy and the monthly pay of the guards, and we should give the headmen an assurance in some form of our good offices against extortion by the Persian authorities except in the case of proved misconduct. The cost estimated at £10,000 per annum, might ultimately be made a charge on the Customs or recovered from the next loan to the Persian Govern ment. The reply of His Majesty's Government to these representations not having by them been received, the Resident telegraphed on 10th March urging an early announcement of our intentions, pacific or otherwise, in as full a manner as possible, and suggesting the following specific measures by the Persian Government:— (1) To induce the Ulema of ISajaf to send telegrams on the lines already advocated to tribal chiefs and headmen. (2) To appoint at once a responsible and independent Governor -General for Pars.22 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT ■ (3) To offer a^Governorship to the Kawam-ul-Mulk and to insist on U departure from Shiraz. In the meantime, however, on March 8th, His Majesty's Foreign Office who were previously disinclined to take active measures and anxious to await the formation of Swedish gendarmerie, now proposed (as they considered the situation in Shiraz to be getting worse), to commence negotiations on the lines suggested above: they enquired whether the despatch of troops was regarded as an^essential preliminary and intimated that, in view of the opinion expressed by His Majesty's Minister that the despatch of troops was unnecessary as far as negotiations were concerned, they were disposed to deprecate the step. The Eesident replied on the 13th March to the Government of India expressing the view that the despatch of troops was a sine qua non to the suc cessful outcome of the negotiations, more particularly in view of the time that had elapsed since the attack on Mr. Smart without any overt action on our part, He considered that there was no reason to think that the situation had got worse, and again urged that if His Majesty's Government decided to take no action to secure reparation, an announcement on the subject should be given the fullest publicity in order that we might, at all events, derive some benefit from this further indication of our friendly forbearance. The Government of India, on March 23rd, intimated to His Majesty's Government that they considered that the Resident should be authorised with out further delay to negotiate with the headmen on the road, but considered despatch of troops to Basidu unnecessary, in view of the improvement in the attitude of the Persian Government: they urged that continued pressure should be brought to bear on the Persian Government in order to effect the punish ment of those responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart. They expresssed the view that our cavalry escorts at Shiraz and Ispahan constituted the one weak spot in our position, and must, until greater security prevailed on the roads, remain where they were. On April 2nd, His Majesty's Government intimated to His Majesty's Minister that, after careful consideration of the whole situation, the following decision had been arrived at:— (1) Those persons who are well known locally to have been guilty of attack on Mr. Smart and party, must be handed over for punish ment to the Persian Government. On this requirement being fulfilled His Majesty's Government would at once withdraw the detachment at Bushire, and if the tribal chiefs and headmen showed for at least two months a friendly feeling and peaceful attitude and if road outrages do not recur, cavalry at Ispahan and Shiraz would also be withdrawn. (2) The Persian Government must undertake, before troops are finally withdrawn, to support the Swedish Officers to the best of their ability. (3) They must also induce the Najaf clergy and extremists at Tehran to telegraph to the tribes as proposed above. (4) A new Governor-General must be sent as soon as possible to Tars. (5) The Kawam to be provided with a good post elsewhere. (6) Occupation of Basidu not considered necessary. (7) No public announcement of our policy held to be advisable, beyond intimation to the Persian Government. and 3 men likelv^C I* woundi ng of Mr. Smart £1,000; for 4 K iii^ value of lost property £944 ^^ently disabled £300 each; for 7 men less seriously wounded menFOR THE YEAR 1912. 23 ment in the matter of the punishment of the guilty parties^ which was not the case. A few days after this decision was reached, the Persian Government learned of the contemplated negotiations with the chiefs; they at once protested strongly that the Central Government's prestige and authority would be damaged thereby : they were told informally in reply that the scheme would not have been carried into execution without the concurrence and approval of the Persian Government, and that the latter's prestige would have been care fully safeguarded. On 19th June His Majesty's Poreign Office telegraphed that there was no room for hope that the culprits would be handed over to the Persian Govern ment within the time limit specified in the British note of April 14th, and enquired w r hether it was politic to continue insisting on the surrender of cul prits : in reply to a request for views on this point the Eesident and also His Majesty's Consul^ Shiraz, urged the vital necessity of securing the punishment of the guilty parties and'His Majesty's Minister in his reply to His Majesty's Foreign Office likewise expressed the opinion that this condition could not advisedly be dispensed with. The^ Government of India expressed the view, on July 12th, that the idea of the indefinite retention of the cavalry under present conditions and of construction of barracks must be abandoned, that cavalry must be retained until October, and that, meanwhile, action might possibly be taken by the new Governor-General such as would enable us without loss of face to withdraw the troops in October, failing this^ the question of the line to be adopted by us would have to be further considered early in September. In commenting on the above, on August 16th, His Majestey's Poreign Office concurred with the views of the Government of India that the regiment should be withdrawn in October; and as regards the possibility of re-estab lishing British prestige intimated that His Majesty's Government were prepared to take any measures that the Government of India or the local British offi cials could suggest which would not entail an expedition into the interior of the country. In the meanwhile, a force of gendarmerie was badly defeated, on August 4th, a few miles from Shiraz, and the situation in and around that town ap peared to be getting worse. His Majesty's Consul, on learning of the above mentioned decision of His Majesty's Foreign Office, urged, on August 15th, that the cavalry regi ment should not be withdrawn until reparation had been obtained, questioned the possibility of withdrawing the regiment without sending up more troops to cover the movement, and suggested instead, that we should support the local Government with small loans, under supervision, and by a regular force say 1,500 strong, gradually to be raised by British officers, the Swedish officers being considered destitute of the necessary qualifications. He added, however, that an essential preliminary to such action would be to rehabilitate our in fluence by securing reparation, sufficiently to give weight to our support of the local Government and to enable our officers to form a local force. In this connection he proposed the despatch of additional troops from India and then to proceed to secure reparation or force, withdrawing as soon as this object had been obtained He anticipated that such action would assist the local Govern ment whose difficulties, on the other hand, would be greatly increased were our cavalry to be withdrawn before the tribes who had attacked them had been called to account. On 20th August His Majesty's Minister telegraphed that Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh, who was about to leave Tehran for Pars did not wish the troops to be withdrawn from Shiraz, but had suggested that the Ispahan detachment should be moved to Shiraz, as a first step towards with drawal, so soon as those responsible for the outrages of December last had been surrendered, a step which he was convinced of his ability to secure, parti cularly if Muhammad Ali Khan, the chief offender, was not to be reckoned as a guilty party, and if execution of culprits was not to be insisted on: * he * On October 23rd the Foreign Office authorised His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz to acquiesce in waiving capitalPERSIAN GUM ADMINISTRATION REPORT said however, that he could not guarantee the safe passage of the troops to r . coast, at all events until we had obtained reparation. On August 21st, the Government of India made the following proposals;^ (1) A Consular guard of 12 cavalry and 1 British officer and 60 sewit. to be left at Shiraz. y (2) A mixed brigade of 1 squadron cavalry, 4 battalions infantry 1 Battery mountain artillery, one company Sappers and Miners and details to be despatched from Bushire to Kazerun plain. force not to be used for punishment of tribes, but for defensive purposes. On August 31st, the Secretary of State replied that he was advised tliat this force was dangerously small even for protective purposes and that, to inflict adequate punishment, a larger force was needed. His Majesty's Minister in commenting on the above proposals deprecated any military action for the present and suggested that the new Governor-General, in whom lie had some confidence, should be financed by His Majesty's Government to enable him to establish himself firmly in the province. As regards the pro posed military operations, he expressed the view that an expedition, if sent should be punitivo and should, if undertaken at all, take the form of an oc cupation of the Kazerun valley until such time as the gendarmerie could take over the road and the abuses of Eahdari' had been regulated. On September 27th, the Government of India addressed the Secretary of State to the following effect:— (i) Idea of punitive expedition had been intentionally discarded, as, though it would have been intelligible had it been despatched in the spring, it would after such a lapse of time be difficult to explain. (ii) It was admitted that suspicion of the tribes and even of the Persian Government would be aroused, that withdrawal of regiment could only be effected with difficulty, and that it wonld only be by firm determination that trend of events towards action could be resisted. (Hi) In view of the opinion of His Majesty's Government and of His Majesty's Minister that it would only be possible to effect withdrawal by a force of sufficient strength to punish assailants seriously and to follow them up for the purpose. Government of India had been led to reconsider the position, as in their opinion such action must necessarily result in prolonged guerilla warfare and very probably the ultimate occupation of southern Persia. (iv) They deprecated any action likely to precipitate occupation, though it was a matter for consideration whether it might not be forced on us in future. The only alternative appeared to be to retain the regiment at Shiraz for the present, and that the Governor-General should be suppoted by us as far ar. possible, though they could not be sanguine of his success. This course was finally decided on, and on October 5th the Ispahan squadron left for Shiraz, arriving there on October 22nd, without incident. Up to the end of the year no steps had been taken by the Governor' . e / al ^ to secure the arrest or surrender of those responsible * for the attach on Mr. Smart's party.

Kal Khan Ali. fu (f0r the a ' tack 0n Kotal) -FOR THE YEAR 1912. 25 taclied by His Majesty's Government to the improvement in the state of the roads that was to be expected so soon as the schemes of the Swedish gendar merie officers had developed, that no apology is needed for devoting some amount of space to a narrative of their plans and doings. The Commandant of the gendermerie submitted his scheme to the British and Kussian Legations early in Pebruary : it was estimated to cost 700,000 Tomans during 21 months, at the end of which time the force would be com pletely organized. The scheme included a force of 1,450 men for the Bushire- Ispahan road at a cost of 254,000 Tomans for 21 months : this force was to be stationed along the roads, but the Commandant hoped tliat he would be able later on to organize a mobile column in addition, whose operations would not be confined to the roads : the hope was expressed that the scheme would be in full swing on the Bushire-Ispahan road a year after the arrival of 3 Swedish officers at Shiraz, and on half the Bushire-Yazdikhast road within 6 months The Eesident in this connection urged that it was essential that the Bushire-Shiraz road should be dealt with en Hoc : until this had been done no practical advantage would accrue to our trade. The first Swedish officer arrived at Shiraz in February and 2 more arrived a month or so later. It was not until August, however, that any attempt was made by the Swedish officers to put the force, which they were engaged in raising, to any practical test, and then the occasion was ill-chosen, and the outcome disastrous. Major Siefvert and Captain Nystrom with 80 mounted and 180 unmounted gendarmes and one mountain gnn marched towards Diringun, about 20 miles south-south west of Shiraz, where they encountered a force, said to be acting under or under the instructions of the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. * The great part of the infantry gendermerie fled without firing a shot, and were surrounded and captured with their arms. The rest of the force wdth the Swedish officers fought for some time but ineffectually : the breech block of the gun blew out and it was soon out of action. There were a number of casualties and nearly all the gendarmerie's rifles appear to have been captured; some of them, however, were afterwards re turned by the Sowlet. This unfortunate incident, which necessarily attacted considerable atten tion throughout Persia and in England, did not tend to engender very san guine hopes of the ultimate success of the gendarmerie, a feeling which the Eckford incident served to accentuate. Meanwhile the attitude of the Swe dish officers towards local authorities in Shiraz was not as satisfactory as it might have been. 'Whilst necessarily without experience in dealing with Orientals, they alienated the sympathy of the Governor-General and of entourage by an unfortunate measure and highhandedness and tactlessness. Major O'Connor was driven to the view that they were not entirely fitted for the task imposed upon them, and urged that in the event of a proposal, then under discussion for the formation of a small regular force of picked men under the Governor-General materialising it should be controlled by British officers of the Indian Army. He anticipated no serious friction with the Swedes, and pointed to the parallel of the Russian Cossack brigade in Northern Persia work ing side by side with the Swedish gendarmerie, and to the fact that the employ ment of Indian officers under the Persian Government in Pars had been sug gested before, notably in the British note of October Mth, 1910. The jproposal . was, still under consideration at rlie end of the year. On December 18th two Swedish Officers, Major Brandel and Captain Ny strom, arrived at Bushire from Shiraz for the purpose of selecting recruits, a number of whom had been brought together by the Governor some three weeks before, at the request of the Governor-General. The association of these officers with the Darya Begi, who had come from Tehran with Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh as his Military Commander, and the fact that two or three of his old Bushire ad herents were in their suite gave rise to a good deal of suspicion and unpleasantness as between them and Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh. In fact they arrived thoroughly imbued with the conviction that the Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh as a friend of Kawam- * His association w ith the incident was afterwards denied both by himself and by the Governor-General, but he seems to bave been responsible for,if not actually the leader of the band in question.20 PEBSIAN GULF ADMINISTEATION REPORT ul-Mulk was necessarily hostile to the gendarmerie, and every action tlie Gow, nor took, such as the arrest of the Kalantar, was invested by them with a sinil ter intention. The Muwaggar- ed-Dowleh on the other hand, knowing that the Darya Beoj was in the Governor-General's entourage was inclined to be suspicious, and not without reason, of various steps taken by the JVIukhbir-es-Sultanehand ofthe instigation of the Daiya Begi. Matters were not improved by the appearance at Bnshire, as interpreter of the Swedish officers, of one ct Muhammad Eeza ' Veneziani, of Shiraz, an Italian Jew and pervert to Islam; and, almost simultaneously, of Muntasir-ul-Mulk in command of a detachment of the Malayir regiment. The latter had given trouble at Ispahan in the past, and it was freely stated that he had been des patched specifically with a view to helping various other intriguers to render the Governor's position untenable. It will be seen therefore that at the close of the year that there was some reason to apprehend that the Swedish officers through ignorance and inexperience might, if they would not listen to the friendly counsel of His Majesty's Consul- General, become involved in the chronic intrigues which are characteristic of Persian administration, a circumstance which could not fail to react unfayonr- ably upon their effectiveness and utility. When the question of withdrawing the troops at Shiraz was mooted, in Financial assistance given by His MajeBty' b August, His Majesty's Consul^ whilst dep- Government to the administration of Fare. recating SUCll action, had suggested ES items of a constructive policy, the raising of a small regular force under British officers, and the reversion to a suggestion he had put forward in May for the support of the local Government by small loans to be expended under supeni- sion; but he expressed the view that the essential preliminary to such a policy would be rehabilitation of our influence by securing reparation sufficient to give weight to the local Government. His Majesty's Minister concurred in this proposal, and suggested that were the Governor-General to be given from £2,000 to £ 3,000 a month, he could create a valuable military force, which would enable him to maintain order : so that by the end of a year he might hope tohaye established himself firmly in the province and to be in a position to collect all the revenue necessary for the wants of his Administration. It was suggested, that the money might be paid through the Treasurer-General to his Agent in Shiraz and handed to the Governor in concert with the British Consul.

The section of the road between Dashtarjin and Shiraz having been officially declared safe and in the control of the gendarmerie, a party of 26 sowars with 17 followers and 17 baggage mules of the Central India Horse, accompanied by Major Kettlewell and Captain Eckford proceeded with the consent of the Gover nor-General, for some days shooting on the Hashtarjin lake, about 40 miles from Shiraz. They were ambushed, however, between Khaneh Zinian and Dashtarjin, on 11th December, by a large body of tribesmen estimated at between 200 and 300 men. The following is the official narrative of the incident, as telegraphed at the time by Major O'Connor, based on Major Kettlewell's detailed report: Party consisted of Major Kettlewell, Captain Eckford, 1 non-commissioned officer, 26 sowars, 17 followers and 17 baggage mules. They started from Khaneh Zinian 7 a. m ., 11th December, half an hour after party of about 150 Persian sarbazes who were marching down road independently. Twelve men were told off as baggage guard, remainder with officers as advance guard. At bridge over Kara Agach river Persian officer of gendarmerie with two mounted gendarmes who had accompanied Major Kettlewell to river, galloped on ahead to inspect gendarmerie post at Burj-i-Timuri on top of Sineh Safid Pass. Major Kettle well also sent on ahead native officer and 2 sowars to prepare quarters at Dash tarjin. Scouts were also posted on wooded hills on left flank. After short halt party proceeded. Eoad here runs through tamarisk and thorn jungle for about 1J miles. The two officers accompanied by six or seven sowars had passed beyond jungle, and just as leading mules were appearing from jungle hot fire was opened on party from hills on left. Advanced party gallop ed ahead, got under cover, dismounted and started to climb hill. It was difficult to discern enemy through thick jungle but shots were exchanged and it was now that Captain Eckford was shot through heart. Eew minutes later Major Kettlewell saw from crest of ridge 150 to 200 men rush out from bottom of ravine below towards river bank His men fired at them but they quickly disappeared into jungle. Meanwhile sowars of baggage guard had crossed to north bank of river and taken up position in low hills. They report that smaller body of robbers joined attack also from north. Major Kettlewell now collected men with him, descended hill and crossed river bed- taking Captain Eckford's body with him. They joined other party and a native officer and two sowars, who had gone ahead, also rejoined party here. Meanwhile robbers appear to have made off over hills to north with their booty. Whole party then returned to Khaneh Zinian moving by north bank of river. During this movement some 15 to 20 horsemen were seen on hills to north and shots exchanged. Major Kettlewell states that he saw no caravan either at Serai at Khaneh Zinian or on road. Small party of Persians with three or four mules who left Serai after sowers had started were robbed and their mules taken. They returned to Serai on foot where Major Kettlewell saw them but he had not seen them on iroad. Major Kettlewell also stated that, beyond the firing, no attempt was made to attack his small party. Bobbers were apparently only out for plunder and cleared off at once when they had seized mules. As to gendarmes, it would appear that Persian officer, when he reached the Burj, brought his men back along crest of hills and it was there that they were wounded. Major Kettlewell only saw them in the distance moving along hills to south when he was return ing towards Khaneh Zinian. Up to the end of the year it was not ascertained with certainty to what tribe or tribes the robbers belonged, but it appears fairly certain that Buwair Ahmadis, Mamasanis and Kashkulis were all implicated, and there is reason to suspect that Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, whose dependants were responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart last year, was, at all events, cognizant of the intention of the band, if he did not actually instigate the raid. Major O'Connor reported that it was clear that the attack was aimed not against the officers and men, but was actuated purely by motives of robbery.2g pfesian gtjlp administration repoet the case differing in this respect from previous attacks made during the year 0l British officers and men : it would seem that the attack on Captain Eckford's party was only incidental to an attack on a large caravan which had k Khaneh Zinian before them and which was just m front: and a number of mules with their loads were carried off from this caravan m addition to those taken from the regimental party. Eeports as to the number of casualties on either side were conflicting, but it appears that four gendarmes were wounded in attempting to follow up the robbers after the incident. Among the latter it seems fairly certain that two were killed and three wounded. The Persian Government were profuse in their expressions of regret and the usual promises to secure the exemplary punishment o f those responsible for the outrage, and with this object an elaborate plan of operations was presented, including a punitive expedition operating from a base at Kazerun, as Bellas encircling movements which were to be entrusted to the Governments of Ispahan and Behbahan (both Bakhtiaris) and to the Bakhtiari Chiefs generally, The confident hope was expressed that within one month those guilty would be captured and brought to justice. The Ministry also spoke confidently of a body of 300 horsemen who were alleged to be actually pursuing the robbers, but it does not appear that this force had any material existence. His Majesty's Minister expressed the opinion on 16th December that the Persian Goyernment would undoubtedly prove incapable ^ of carrying out the above measures, and that in view of that contingency it was desirable that Government should take steps to prepare an expedition in the spring that would be able to restore order, and if necessary punish offenders on the Bushire- Shiraz road. In the meanwhile, however, he pointed out that we were obliged by climatic conditions alone to give the Persian Government a delay of two or three or even four months in which to attempt to execute their proposed punitive measures and to give the Governor-General a chance of proving his mettle, the expediency of the latter course having been strongly urged on him by Major O'Connor. On December 18th the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed to His Majesty's Minister his earnest hopes that the Governor-General would be allowed sufficient time by His Majesty's Government to execute the punitive measures now under preparation, in the successful outcome of which he expressed confidence, adding that he would be the first to welcome a British punitive force if the measures to be taken by the Persian Government failed. In reply to an enquiry by His Majesty's Poreign Office as to the practic ability of a Bakhtiari punitive expedition, under British officers, if necessary, all local officers concerned strongly deprecated any such project, and His Majesty's Minister likewise regarded it with disfavour. The Darya Begi left Shiraz on December 22nd with a force of about 100 Persian soldiers en route to Kazerun, where it was contemplated that he would organize on behalf of the Governor-General a small local force of some 600 men with a view to subsequent punitive operations. Considerable ferment was created at the beginning of the year in Shiraz Events in shim. tlle despatch of inflammatory from Najaf and Tehran inciting the tnoes and others to resist ' the southern neighbour ' and certain leading Mullahs Shiraz actively incited the local population to adopt an anti-foreign attitude ; 0 which the pricipal manifestations were a run on the local branch of the Imp® Bank of Persia and a short-lived by cot t of Messrs.

H. H. Bill, I.O S., in his report for 1907 to 1908 that 'the divinity which did hedge a European and especially the property of a European, has to a great extent vanished, and the impunity enjoyed without exception by all the perpetrators has not tended to restore it.' In recording before leaving Shiraz his appreciation of the behaviour of the 39th Central India Horse, Mr. Smart added that their conciliatory and friendly demeanour had gone far to commend them to the townspeople and that there had been a noticeable absence of friction between the troops and the populace generally. The condition of the Bushire-Ispahan road remained deplorable through- „ , , , „ out the year: the combined effect of Condition of trade routes in Fars. « Rahdari'', insufficiency of mules, and current hostilities between districts along the route (the latter factor operating principally between Borasjun and Kazerun) was to raise mule hire to a figure undreamt of a few years ago. These circumstances, combined with the anarchy which prevailed on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road during the summer, caused a rapid increase in Russian and a corresponding decrease in British Trade in Ispahan, and this most important market, in which up to a few years ago British trade predominated almost to the exclusion of that of Russia bids fair to be lost to us unless the state of the southern roads soon improves. A few figures may be quoted in illustration of the above :— Transport per 100 mans (775 lbs). 1907 Krans av. 124 1908 170 1909 » 250 1910 » 170 1911 )&gt; 155 1912 » 395 Not only did the rate touch 50 Tomans (£9) for general merchandise, but in October muleteers were asking 32 Tomans (about £6) for each mule of a convoy of 160 mules to take supplies to the Central India Horse in Shiraz I Exactions of this kind were not confined to the roads: both at Shiraz (3 to 4 Krans) and at Bushire (fKrans) levies were made on mules leaving the town, on various pretexts. The gendarmerie had not succeeded, up to the end of the year, even in inducing local chiefs to moderate their charges; gendarmerie posts were established in October between Shiraz and Kazerun, but they were withdrawn in November, having proved unable, according to the Governor- General's own statement, to prevent the local chiefs taking ' Rahdari ' between Bashtarjin and Kazerun. Erom Dashtarjin to Shiraz, a distance of 40 miles, ' Rahdari' was said to have been stopped, but this would appear to have been due less to the measures adopted by the gendarmerie than to the departure to their winter quarters of the Kashkulis who infested the route. Oerman. —Doctor H. Listemann, who enjoys the personal rank of Consul, ^ was in charge of the German Yice-Consu- Foreign interests, j a |. e throughout the year. While main taining a strictly correct attitude towards British Official representatives and friendly relations with the Russian Consul-General, he was at daggers drawn with the Prench Doctor and the Belgian Customs Director and part of the British mercantile community over personal matters. In March, a German subject named Roever, a merchant resident in Shiraz, came down to Bushire to be married by Doctor Listemann. Two other German subjects, Herr Heinicke and his wife, also of Shiraz, passed through Bushire on retirement from Persia. With the exception of Herr Appelt, an Austrian subject, late of Constantionople, who arrived in December vid India en route to30 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION EEPORT Shiraz. where he was said to be proceeding on business connected with tk purchase of carpets, and of the Agent of the Hamburg-Amerika Line i! Bushire ; these are believed to be the only foreigners coming under Doctor Listemann's jurisdiction, within the year. The Hamburg-Amerika Line and Herr Eobert Wonckhaus and Company were represented till May by Herr Eisenhut and Herr Sandri. men Herc Eisenhut departed on leave in the summer, Herr Albert TJhlemann arrived from the Basrah branch to replace him. In the early autumn Herr Sandri vas also transferred to Basrah. Twelve vessels of the Hamburg-Amerika Line called at Bushire on the outward voyage during 1912, and landed about 42,630 packages from Antwerp, a total of 47,807. This total was over 10,000 packages in excess of the figure for 1911, and constitute a notable increase, composed entirely of Belgian loaf sugar. -The last two or three vessels were carrying the initial consignments of material for the Baghdad Railway Company to be discharged at the wharf, which the Company have leased above Basrah : transhipment of this cargo and arrangements for forwarding rt to Baghdad were to remain in the hands of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company till February 1st, 1913. No German vessel loaded with dates for Australia this year, and the field was left open to the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels. On the homeward voyage 12 vessels of the line called at Bushire (the last leaving for Bombay) and loaded consignments of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Com pany for Hamburg, and a limited number of packages, general cargo, for Persian exporters -Monsieur A. Dmitrieff remained as Acting Consul-General throughout 1912. The Russian Steamship Agency was in the hands of Monsi eur Alexandre Konoff, who returned from Russia during Hie year. His elder brother is in charge of the Agency at Basrah. In January 1912, while the Resident was on duty in India, Monsieur Dmitrieff, in collaboration with Monsieur Konoff, began hoisting two powerful Acetylene Lamps high upon the flagstaff of the Russian Consulate-General, with the object, as he himself said, of assisting vessels to navigate at night. The lights were much appreciated by the seafaring community and all shipping and could be seen far out at sea. By the summer they were, however, working very irregularly, being often extinguished during high winds and towards the end of the year first one and then the other lantern got out of order and were not shown regularly.

In March a visit was paid to Kuwait in company with His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief: on the way back the paddle shaft of the ' Lawrence' unfortunately fractured and she was obliged to proceed under her own steam, though only able to use one paddle-wheel, to Bombay for repair. She was replaced temporarily by the E. I. M. S. ' Investigator' which was kindly placed at the disposal of the Resident by the Marine authorities. The Resident visited Ahwaz in April, and in connection with the discussion proceeding with reference to the Turko-Persian Frontier in the Arabistan region proceeded thence to Hawizeh and westward to the village of Shwaiyib on the edge of the marsh into which the Karkhah empties its waters, and which drains into the Shatt-el-Arab above Basrah. From Shwaiyib he returned to Mohammerah via Kishk-al-Hawizeh» Kishk-al-Basri and Diaji. From Mohammerah the Resident proceeded by mail to Maskat, where lie remained until the first week in June in connection with Arms Traffic negotia tions. On leaving Maskat he visited Bandar Abbas, Henjam, Basidu, Lingah, Bahrain and Kuwait. Mohammerah was again visited in August in connection with the Turko- Persian Frontier question.

From Bushire he proceeded in the 'Lawrence' to Mohammerah, where he visited the Shaikh and Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait who happened to be staying there at the time : the day following he went to Ahwaz and Shushtar, en route for Ispahan and Tehran.

During tliG year 1912 the hospital has treated i 13,716 out-patients. Ho8plta1, 31 in-patients. 599 operations have been performed. This shows an increase of 319 out-patients treated as compared to 1911, in spite of the fact that, during the severe epidemic of ^ plague that existed from Eebruary to end of June, the attendance was diminished, and also that, owing to the moving of the hospital to other quarters, the hospital was closed for about three weeks except for urgent cases; nor does it include any of tlie people who came for inoculation during the epidemic of plague, nor people attended in their houses who were suffering from plague. It is satisfactory to find that for the past three years there has been an appreciable increase each year in the attendance. During the year the health of the Gulf Ports has been satisfactory with the o ^ exception of Bushire, which was visited am ary opera ions. a severe epidemic of plague, lasting from the beginning of Eebruary to the end of June: during this period there were 965 cases with 725 deaths, against 118 cases with 97 deaths in 1911, about 6,000 people are supposed to have left the place during the epidemic. Inoculation proved much more popular than in 1911 as 4,048 were against 422 in 1911; about half of this number were inoculated at the One sepoy of the Residency guard was attacked; he was amongst the native regiment made a good recovery: no cases occurred Reshire. The attitude of the Sanitary Council at Tehran was very friendly during the course of the epidemic and they expressed their thanks to the Quarantine Staff after the epidemic was over; the local authorities also were more enlightened in their attitude and more helpful than in previous years. In October, three cases of cholera having been reported from Ahwaz, Cap tain James, I.M.S., the Mobile Assistant, was sent there in case an epidemic might break out, but luckily no further cases occurred. There were no epidemics at any of the other Gulf Ports, vii-t Mohammerah, Lingah, Bandar Abbas, Jask, Kuwait, Bahrain and Debai. Table working of the Persian Quarantine stations 1912.

On information supplied by this Vice-Consulate, he was arrested at Bandar Abbas and imprisoned. This individual was also implicated with a gang of Persian officials and others in holding secret indignation meetings, directed partly against British interests, and with a view to obtaining the m missal of the Deputy Governor, who was aware and fearful of their powerless.

He is hasty, and given to applying much energy in upholding the dignity of his office and to petty matters, and has little sympathy with the methods and customs of the people. Smuggling of arms and ammunition, coffee, tea, and aniline dye, con tinues unchecked. A Customs launch has been stationed at Lingah throughout tie yeai, but it is used chiefly for collecting revenue from outposts and making transfers. 5:3 The Director of Customs took over charge of the collection of all land revenues, of the Lingah district from the Deputy Governor, apparently in April, EevUfue. 110 notification of the change has ever . . ., .. _ ^ een made to this Vice-Consulate.

These increased powers proved too much tor Monsieur W illemsens, who regarded the Deputy Governor as part of his establishment to be ordered about at will and even threatened with deductions from his salary. ^ Hie continuance of these financial powers vested in the Customs seems likely to lead to the assumption of political importance and interference by the Belgian Customs Directors. Naband. Anent the performances of the Customs as revenue collectors, the distiict of Naband falls within the scojjc of the Provincial Director at Bushire, who, experiencing difficulty in collecting outstandings from the Shaikh evolved the sympathetic {sic) idea of assisting the Shaikh's neighbour and enemy, the Shaikh of Gabandi, to attack him and take possession of the Naband district. The Shaikh of Naband acknowledged his obligation, and justly pleaded to be excused liability for villages, which were captured from him years before by his enemies of Gabandi, but to this the Einancial Administration turned a deaf ear, and iji July, organized an expedition consisting of a field gun and 200 tufangchis, which were sent from Bushire by the Persian ship t{ Persepolisto ^ ^ ie Shaikh of Gabandi and assist him in annihilating the people of .N aband. The expedition proved an utter failure, and, having accomplished nothing after two months' operations, returned to Bnshire without the field was ^ken possession of by the Administration's friend, the Shaikh or Gabandi, who refused to give it up. unjust action was induced by a menial Persian official of the Administration, named Shahab bin Muhammad, to meet his own corrupt ends, and who,^ later, committed^ the indiscretion of writing to the Shaikh of Nab and, in the name of his Adminstr&lt;ition and of the Persian Government serious^ aspersions against British interests.

During the year he has appointed and deposed many so-called Governors of Lar. Saiyid Haji Baba of Bairani (Governor) was relieved in April in favour of a Baharlu Arab, named Khurshid Khan^ who in turn displeased the ruling Saiyid and was deposed in July, when he became an outlaw and revenged himself by plundering caravans and cattle in the vicinity of Lar. Ghulam Husein Khan or Varavi was then made Governor, and, as usual, the unfortunate Lari mer« chants were compelled to make him a large allowance for the office, besides88 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT feeding his numerous tufaugchis and followers, for their supposed protection With these calls, aud au Ex-Goyernor plundering their carayans, in aclditi a to the usual depredations by Baharlu and Nafar robbers on the road, the diffi! culties of trading can be gauged. For years past a bitter enmity has existed between the Laris and Girasliis and in December, the latter made an attack on Lar, which however did not deyelop into more than the plundering of cattle and the destruction of the Laiis 1 water-supply. BastaiX-Vmrng the threatened attack on Lingah in March, the Chief of Bastak, Muhammad Taqi Khan, Sowlet-ul-Mulk, remained loyal and rejected the advances made to him by the enemy for free access through his district For months he applied himself to fortifying the passes m his district. His Majesty's Yice-Consul had the opportunity of meeting him and his Mughu in October. Shih Kuh, Tavuneh —ln October the Shaikh of Tavuneh, bin Eahma, and two of his followers, were treacherously shot Gaithoo, Muhammad and Ahmed bin Jasim, who were concerned m a piracy in 1903, the first named being captured and retained for some years in custody at Bahrain. Shaikh Muhammad bin Eahma recovered slightly and came to Lingah for treatment, and, at the advice of the Medical Officer, was sent to t£e Civil Hospital at Karachi. He returned thoroughly cured, and was most grateful for the attention shown to him. ^ Threatened attach on Lingah. —In revenge for the capture of a large con signment of rifles made by H. M. S. ' Tamil ' on the 10th Eehmary, wMcl proved to belong to people of the Varavi and Turakama tribes, the. religions head, Agha Mir Abul Hassan Tali, proclaimed for an attack on Lingah and invoked the support of Saiyid Abdul Husein of Lar, who promptly issued a ' Jahad ' and promised to join the movement. The threatened attack assumed serious proportions by the 7th March, and, as it was directed against Briti influence, it was decided to increase the Vice-Consulate guard. OntheM March, two British Officers, three Native Officers, 126 fighting men and 20 fol io wers of the 7th Duke of Connaught's Own Rajputs from Jask, under tk command of Major J. Stewart, were landed, and remained on shore till the 191 April. The enemy were joined by the Shaikhs of Ishkanu, Galehdar and Gabandi, and, according to reports, numbered some 5,000 strong at Ishkanu, where they waited for some considerable time for Saiyid Abdul Husein, who, it transpired later, was much disturbed and engaged by the movements of the son of tlie Kawam-ul-Mulk, Nasrat-ed-Dowleh. to the north of Lar. Owing to the Saiyids inability to assist them and to the spread of exaggerated rumours of preparations made at Lingah, dissension grew in the ranks of the enemy. The Shaikhs oi Galehdar and Gabandi, who were not really in sympathy with the movement, were the first to disassociate themselves with it. With the lack of supplies and any form of organization, discontent spread among the enemy, who dispersed by the end of April. A month later a feeble attempt was made by Saiyid Abdul Husein to agau 1 fan the flame but, it met with no response. \ Nasrat-ed-Boicleh. —During his travels in the Jahrum district m ApJ' the Kawam-ul-Mulk's son, Nasrat-ed-Dowleh, had an altercation witn ^ Baharlu Chief, Eeza Kuli Khan, at Fasa, in connection with the recovery taxes. ^ Eeza Kuli Khan is said to have threatened Nasrat-ed-Do^ 6 &gt; ^ shot him in self-defence.

The actual figure for the whole Shib Kuh coast, as far as Naband, is probably more, as good information of imports smuggled, beyond Birkeh Sifla to the eastward, and Chiru to the west, is not available. The arms are brought from the Trucial Coast, principally, according to information, from Sharjah and Ajman, in small lots of 40 to 100 rifles, and the usual method of boats is to promptly jettison their cargoes, if there is any fear of capture by naval ships. Boats belonging to Oharak, Mughu and Duvvan are chiefly engaged in the trade, while the arms are mostly consigned to Evazi traders, financed by the some of the principal merchants at Lingah, many of whom are interested. The quality of arms imported is chiefly the 275 Sporting Mauser, the price of which at Lar stood at about Es. 250 early in the year, and later dropped to Es. 210, owing to a plentiful supply. A large number of the rifles are absorbed by the Shaikhs of Shib Kuh and the Chiefs of small districts in Laristan, whose fighting men are mostly armed with Mausers. As reported last year there are still indications that some of the rifles are taken to Yezd, and get into the hands of Afghans trading v ith that town. Arms jettisoned during the year by boats crossing to the Persian coast, according to information received, totals 655 rifles and 43 Mauser pistols, which may safely be taken as a low estimate. Captures Other than that effected by H. M. S. ' Tamil' on the 10th ^February, consist of only 4 rifles, 2 Mauser pistols, 864 rounds of ammunition, 4 rifle bolts, with a quantity of personal kit and many letters, made by Police Constable Muhammad Anwar on board the British India Steam Navigation Company's S. S. ' Patiala ' at Debai on the 25th May. The owner of these arms, Muhammad Sharif bin Ibrahim Shafia Balooki of Lingah, was arrested by the Shaikh of Debai and subsequently imprisoned at Bushire. In August the Deputy Governor made a capture at Meharakan of about 60 rifles, en route from Lingah to Lar, but some leakage occurred, and the number reported was only 45 rifles, still in his possession. Of the five cases of applicants for manumission, pending enquiry at the slave Trade c ^ 0se 0; ^ l^ll, all were manumitted. During the year only 11 slaves sought redress at the Vice-Consulate ; four were granted manumission and five cases were rejected, the remaining two cases being still under investigation.

Rindarahi firing case. —A serious case of firing on a Bushire boat lade with goods consigned to Messrs. Gray Paul and Company of Lingah occurred at the end of December 1911. The outrage was committed by inhabitants of the Island of Hindarabi, subordinate to the Shaikh of Ohiru, and, as lie flat! refused responsibility and redress, a demand for immediate settlement of tlj case, or payment of a fine of Es. 5,000, was presented to him at Chim on the 10th March. The fine was paid. This strong action brought the his senses and he promptly agreed to imprison the Headman of who was responsible for the firing. As the Shaikh of Ohiru was su of good behaviour and friendly, the fine of Rs. 5,000 recovered from him expenses for damage done and compensation amounting to Es 228-4, was remi ted to him on the 23rd August. *8.

NEW, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul Assistant Resident, Lingah. Lingah, The 25th January 1913 .]FOE THE YEAR 1912. 43 chapter iii. ADMINISTEATION EEPOET EOE, THE BANDAE ABBAS VICE- CONSULATE POE THE YEAE 1912. The year under review falls naturally into two portions : during the first Genpral six months trade was almost at a standstill. Merchandise was accumulating at the port without it being possible to send it up to the interior, and so bad did things become that several British Indian firms were temporarily in serious financial straits. During the same period a difficult political situation was created by the action of the Local Director of Customs which resulted in the bazaars being closed for about three weeks, and the Deputy Governor and leading members of the Persian mercantile community taking 'bast' at the Consulate as a protest against his action. In the midst of this a large band of raiders entered the district and approached within two miles of the town : H. M. S. ' Perseus' and ' Alert' arrived and troops were disembarked for the defence of the town, but the local authorities ultimately succeeded in dealing with the situation. The second half of the year was almost as uneventful as the first had been eventful. At the end of August a party of about 50 armed horsemen entered the district and robbed some unfortunate Parsee British subjects who were tempo rarily residing outside the town, but with this exception nothing that merits to be chronicled occurred during this six months, though indeed in the present state of Persia such a condition of affairs is perhaps more remarkable than the reverse would have been. Erom November onwards numerous caravans arrived from Kerman, and by the end of the year a large quantity of merchandise had been transported with security to the interior, and the congestion which had previously existed had been almost entirely removed. v . n 1f Captain H. V. Biscoe held charge of the Vice-Consulate throughout the year. Mirza Muhammad Ali, Sadid-i-Sultaneh continued to represent Eussian xn . t&gt; interests here in the capacitv of Consular Foreign IvoprGscntivtivos. ji • i Agent : the post however is purely honorary, there being neither pay nor work attached to it. Mullah Abdur Eahman, Misbah-i-Diwan, held the appointment of Deputy _ , Governor up to 20th April when he was Local Government. i-i mi dismissed under circumstances which will be chronicled under another head. He was succeeded by Ali Karam Khan who subsequently assumed the title of Shuja-i-Nizam and retained the appointment till the close of the year. He is entirely illiterate, and during his first few months of office was weak and apathetic, at any rate where British subjects were concerned. On the return of His Majesty's Consul from Karachi however he appears to have received a hint from Bushire to change his attitude, and he has since proved himself a fairly capable and satisfactory incumbent. Saiyid Husein, Hassam-e-Saadat, retained the appointment of Karguzar of Bandar Abbas and Lingah throughout the year. There was no permanent Deputy Governor of Minab up to the month of June, various incompetent nominees of the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas being from time to time appointed. The post is of some importance from the point of view of local British interests as many Hindu firms have extensive dealings with the inhabitants of Minab and finance the harvest there, and many claims are always outstanding in this connection. As a result therefore of representations by His Majesty's Consul, Kerbelai, Muhammad Hassan was appointed Deputy Governor of that district in June, and remained there up to the end of the year. He is a relative of Khan Bahadur Agha Badr of Lingah44 PERSIAN GTJM 1 ADMINISTRATION REPORT and has always been most friendly disposed towards British subjects WU not a man of much force of character or influence, he does his best to obtai a settlement of outstanding claims against Persian subjects, and generally w with a fair measure of success ; he is a veiy satisiactoiy man for the post. Monsieur Zwinne held the post oi Director of Customs up to the 23rd hh when he was relieved by Monsieur ri Conduct of Director of Customs. lettc from Lingah, who in turn ^ relieved by Monsieur Zwinne, on 1st December. The latter continued to hold the post to the end of the year. The feature of the administration this year has been the handing oyer to the Director of Customs entire control of the finances of the district. Under tlie previous system the Deputy Grovernor used to collect and pay to the Governoi of the Gulf Ports the revenue of the district minus such charges as pay of tufangchis, etc., which he could get his superior to allow, and anything additional to these which he could extract from the local inhabitants went into his own pocket, and formed his salary. In February^ the Deputy-Governor was informed that, from the beginning of the next Persian year, i .e., from 21st March, the revenue should be paid to the Director of Customs who would paj the Deputy Governor such sum as might be fixed as his salary, and as pay for his establishment, tufangchis, etc. The introduction of this system, which w consequent on the appointment of Monsieur Mornard as Treasurer-General, completely altered the status of the Director of Customs and, from being an official appointed to perform certain well-defined and limited functions, he became a factor in the local political situation and in some ways the most influential person in the district. As controller of the purse he could bring considerable pressure to bear on all Persian officials, who naturally found it i their interest to adopt a subservient attitude towards him, and his functions were extended to every branch of the civil administration. As was mentioned in last year's report, Monsieur Zwinne was very lax in exercising supervision over his subordinates; he attended office but seldom,and left everything in their hands. As he was also a person with strong likes and dislikes, the result was that certain Customs employes who stood high in his favour obtained an unduly influential position at the customs and, in many instances, adopted a very high-handed attitude towards the mercantile commun ity, who had no redress, as the Director of Customs was seldom at the office and even then could only be approached through his interpreter. On assuming charge of the finances Monsieur Zwinne announced the introduction of various local taxes, which had been abolished by, and in abeyance since, the Anglo- Persian Commercial Convention of 1903. The irritation caused by the conduct of the Customs employes was augmented by the introduction of these taxes and finally culminated, on 5th April, in all the Persian merchants of the town clos ing their shops and taking 'bast' at the Persian Telegraph office, demanding the dismissal of two Customs employes, a Monsieur Patei^ a Dutch subject, and a Persian by name Mirza Husein Khan. Monsieur Zwinne appears to haie reported to Tehran that their action was really a protest against the introduction of the ^ new taxes and was fomented by the local priests and the local agent o the Moin-ut-Tuj jar of Tehran, and asked that the latter should be expelled fro 111 the town. Monsieur Mornard approached His Maiesty's Minister o^ the suO- ^ a ^ er as ^ :e( ^ f 01 'the views of His Maiesty's Consul. Onreceip oi this telegram the latter interviewed Monsieur Zwinne and after some t 18 cussron Monsieur Zwinne agreed that Monsieur Pater should be transferred t Char bar by the first steamer and that he would hold an enquiry into any spec 1 complaints that might be put forward against Mirza Husein Khan. ^ Te o 0 ® tionswere then carried on through the Misbah-i-Diwan with the merclian and finally, on the 12th April, they met Monsieur Zwinne at the Cons* and there the above terms were formally agreed to by both parties,^ meic ants left bast' and the bazaars were opened. iVTrw* 16 Misbah-i-Diwan undoubtedly rendered valuable assistance inthisnic# thp pff Ur 4- .fw 1 ? 0 ^ on one 01 ^ wo occasions complained to Captain Bisc SLS^ lle ^. nd him difficul t to deal with in financial matted J wffll w-^ 0S f^ y 0f re P laci ng him: the latter however stated that,® MonXl 7 • '^ wanworkedwellasfaras was concerned, and uii r wmne could name a really satisfactory substitute he was not pr PFOR THE TEAE 1912. 45 to move in the matter; he was however quite willing to use such influence as he possessed in support of Monsieur Zwinne should the Mishah-i-Diwan prove obstructive in any way. As Monsieur Zwinne was then in the habit of consulting Captain Biscoe in almost every matter of importance in local affairs, and subsequently sought his advice regarding the salary that should be paid to the Deputy Governor, and other details of the new regime, Captain Biscoe not unnaturally assumed that he had dropped the idea of making any representations against the Misbah. On the 20th March the Misbah-i-Diwan had received reports to the effect that the Governor of Eushire contemplated dismissing him; as he feared arrest he took 'bast' at the Consulate. On the 23rd March however assurances for his personal safety were given by the Governor through the Eesidenfc and he was induced to return to his duties. This digression is necessary for a proper understanding of what subsequently occurred. The mail steamer by which Monsieur Pater was to leave for Charbar was expected on 18th April, but two days before it was due. Captain Biscoe ascertained that Monsieur Zwinne did not intend to adhere to the terms of the agreement entered into with the merchants, and to send Monsieur Pater off by that mail. At an interview which took place Monsieur Zwinne admitted this, but stated that he had not understood that Monsieur Pater was to leave by the first mail : but on Captain Biscoe's pointing out the extreme undesira- bility of his not adhering exactly to the agreement entered into with the merchants, he again agreed definitely that Monsieur Pater should leave that mail. On Thursday afternoon, however, just after the mail had left. Monsieur Zwinne wrote and informed His Majesty's Consul that he had after all found it inconvenient to send Monsieur Pater to Charbar, but had sent him to Hormuz, an island about seven miles off, to await the following mail. The following day the principal merchants of the town arrived at the Consulate, informed Captain Biscoe that it was quite evident that the Director of Customs had no intention of keeping faith with them and announced their intention of taking 'bast ' at the Consulate and closing the bazaar as a protest against his action. It also transpired that Monsieur Zwinne, while accepting Captain Biscoe's mediation in his difficulties with the merchants, had at the same time been acting in direct opposition to his known wishes and had been making representations against the Misbah-i-Diwan to Tehran, as a result of which the S.S. ' Persepolis' had left Bushire with a new Deputy Governor and some tufangchis on board and had anchored that day behind the island of Hormuz, with the object of effecting a surprise and landing the new Deputy Governor and his tufangchis at night and capturing the Misbah-i- Diwan. As however the Belgian commander of the ' Persepolis ' landed on the beach at Bandar Abbas at noon in the steam cutter of the ship, and subsequently left with the Director of Customs for Hormuz, the plan was ill- laid, the Misbah-i-Diwan was informed of the intention to capture him and in company with some 200 tufangchis also sought 'bast' at the Consulate, which fortunately possessed an extensive compound. At about midnight the &lt;c Persepolis ' arrived with the new Deputy Governor, Ali Karam Khan, Monsieur Zwinne and Monsieur Pater on board ; it subsequently transpired that the latter had proceeded from Hormuz to Minab to collect tufangchis to support Monsieur Zwinne's projected coup d'etat. For some time an absolute impasse existed : the bazaars were closed, the ex-Deputy Governor and a large number of tnfangchis were in &lt;c bast' at the Consulate and all business was at a standstill. Monsieur Zwinne appeared to be thoroughly alarmed at the turn affairs had taken, and again sought Captain Biscoe's assistance, but the latter naturally declined to be a party to any further negotiations and the merchants resolutely declined to enter into any direct communication with him. Telegrams were sent by them to Tehran demanding Monsieur Zwinne's transfer, and Captain Biscoe suggested that either Monsieur Zwinne should be transferred or the Misbah-i-Diwan reinstated. The impasse continued till 9th May when news was received that a band of raiders about 400 strong under one Husein Kalleh Khan, a follower of Saiyid Abdul Husein of Lar, had entered the district. On 13th May a large number of men were visible on a ridge about two miles north of the Consulate and some sowars rode up to within about half a mile of the town. As the loca authorities appearedpersian gxtli' administration report in be unable to take any active steps against them, His Maiestv's , asked for the presence'of a Maa-of-War. H. M._ 'Perssus' arrived on the following day and anchored m front of then! sulate. The main body of the raiders was at a place called Issin, about ten rnf! north of Bandar Abhas and a body of about 150 men continued to J on the ridge two miles north of the Consulate On the evening of the Z May a body of about 100 sowars appeared in the hamlet of Naibaad two 2 east of the centre of the town, and the chief source of water supply. MotZ length to action by the fear of having the water supply cut off, the Depnb Governor took active steps against the raiders and, at about 11 A MoHtli! 16th, a force of 150 tufangchis supported by a gun of ancient model advJ on Naiband: a battle ensued in which some five or six were killed on eacl side, but one cf the leaders of the raiders, a brother of Husein KallehKk was mortally wounded and this turned the scale and after about one and alj hour's fighting they withdrew. The local tufangchis were reported by thistici to have exhausted all their ammunition, and as it seemed not unlikely tbttk raiders might attempt to take their revenge to which the local forces coulj have offered no resistance, it was ultimately decided to land a force froml Majesty's ships for the defence of the life and property of British subjects. Tfe landing operations commenced at 4-30 p m ., but unfortunately it was blowiip hard at the time and considerable difficulty was experienced in bringing the km laden boats through the surf. One boat was swamped and two men were droW, and it was not till about 7-30 p.m . that the force of 110 men were i ashore. The raiders appear to have remained at Issin the following day ht, on the 18th May, news was received that they had left for the interior and tk troops were re-embarked. On the approach of the raiders the majority i merchants fearing danger to their families and property had left the Consulate and re-opened the bazaar. The Misbah-i-Diwan however remained in 'last,' Finally, on 6th June, the Political Eesident arrived in the E. L I, S. ' Investigator ' from Maskat and, on the 8th June, His Excellency tk Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh arrived from Bushire in the u Mozafferi.' Hisli- cellency declined to reinstate the Misbah-i-Diwan at Bandar Abbas, but after considerable pressure agreed to appoint him as Deputy Governor of some plate within his jurisdiction within a period of two months. These terms m accepted and the Misbah-i-Diwan proceeded to Karachi to await lis appointment. It was not until he had been reminded by the Political Kesideni that the Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh proceeded to fuliil his undertaking, but i length, at the beginning of September 5 orders were issued to the MisM appointing him Deputy Governor of Lingah and directing him to proceed to Bushire to receive instructions prior to assuming charge of the post. He displayed considerable reluctance at the idea of proceeding to Bushire, i finally promised Captain Biscoe, who was then at Karachi and on the eve i returning to Bandar Abbas, that he would do so and would leave by tie following mail. Apparently, however, after Captain Biscoe's departure, i courage failed him, and he was subsequently heard of at Calcutta, hayin? definitely refused to go to Bushire. In July Monsieur Zwinne was transferred to Bushire and succeeded Monsieur Collette, who held charge till 1st December when Monsieur returned. The change was regretted as Monsieur Collette proved himself an eminently obliging and reasonable official during his tenure of the post At the beginning of the year the routes from Bandar Abbas to ^ Condition of country. were extremely insecure, and bu , , merchandise was sent up to the in r ^. , stagnant at Kerman and the Hindu firms would not take the which tney would probably have taken had a brisker market been - , en goods at their destination.

David Sassoon and Company of Karachi, were robbed of everything they had with them, watches, jewellery and even clothes, and arrived subsequently at the Consulate in a very destitute condition. Apart, however, from this one incident the closing months of the year have shown a distinct improvement in the condition of the country. Erom Novem ber onwards numerous caravans and travellers have come down from and left for the interior without incident of any kind. The long-continued anarchy in Persia appears to have at length caused ^ , T . , the collapse of many Persian firms in the Bntisn Interests. • i. • •n p j * n interior: with many of these firms the Hindu firms of Bandar Abbas and Kerman had extensive dealings. The failure of the Persian firms consequently reacted directly on the Shikarpuri firms many of whom found themselves involved in a severe financial crisis. Drafts drawn on Bombay to a considerable amount by various Persians in Kerman and purchased by Hindus were dishonoured on presentation; this caused a panic, and both the Banks and Hindus ceased to deal in Persian drafts: the Hindus however had obligations to meet in Karachi, and being unable to remit money by draft, had, in some cases, to ship goods back to Karachi for sale there. Heavy remittances were sent by post, and to such an extent did the money-order work of the Post Office increase, that an extra assistant had to be sent up from Bombay to enable the local Postmaster to cope with the work. Representations were made by Shikarpur firms to the Government of India, the Commissioner in Sind and the Karachi Chamber of Commerce, and ultimately arrangements were made between the Hindus and their creditors, who consisted mainly of European firms in Karachi, by which a period of grace was given them in which to meet their liabilities. This the opening of the routes ultimately enabled them to do, and it is hoped that the brisk caravan traffic between Bandar Abbas and Kerman at the close of the year will completely re-establish their financial equilibrium. The failure of these firms, in whose hands is probably 90 per cent, of the trade of this port, and whose activities lie almost exclusively within the British sphere of influence, would have been a serious contingency. The British India Steam Navigation Company continued their fortnightly service of steamers throughout the year: the service however was insufficient to carry the cargo, and extra steamers were sent up very frequently. As the sailings of these letter boats were irregular, the service proved unsatisfactory, and before the close of the year the Company had announced their intention of reverting to the weekly service, which will certainly prove much more satisfac tory to shippers. The Arab Steamers Limited had at their inception published a time table of regular fortnightly sailings: to this however they have been quite unable to adhere, and their sailings have been gradually becoming fewer and more irregu lar. It seems doubtful whether the Company can continue long unless they have a radical change of management. The ships of the Russian Steam Navigation Company paid 7 calls at Bandar Abbas during the year.

Henjam possesses a sheltered anchorage, is easy of access and centrally situated. As soon as the supply of coal at Basidu is exhausted, His Majesty's ships will coal at Henjam, 50 tons only being left at Basidu. Thirty slaves took refuge at the Consulate during the past year, out of which number 13 were manumitted, the remainder being either restored amicaWj to their masters, or leaving the Consulate while their cases were undei investigation.

Haig held charge of the Consulate from the British Consulate. beginning of the year until October 23rd when ne made over eharffe. by telegraph, to Major W. P. T. O'Connor, O.I.E., then at Tehran. Major O'Connor in turn made over charge to Captain D. L. E. Lorimer by telegraph, on October 31st. Captain Lorimer, the writer of the present report, did not arrive at Kerman during the year under review, and he there fore writes without any personal knowledge of the facts or events recorded. Lieutenant-Colonel T. W. Haig, C. M. G., left Kerman for Bandar Abbas, proceeding on leave, on 3rd October 1912, and reached the latter place on 23rd October 1912. On leaving Kerman he made over acting charge to Mr. L. Newman, Local Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia who continued to be acting Consul until 26th November 1912, when he was relieved by the Honor ary Vice-Consul Mirza Nasrullah Khan. This appointment of a private individual, Mr. Newman, led to a demur by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who urged that it was customary in such circumstances to entrust the Consulate to the Senior Gazetted Government Officer in the station, in this case the Superintendent, Mr. Tanner. Lieutenant Colonel Haig adduced reasons in this case for his choice, and the appointment was upheld by higher authority; but it will doubtless not form a precedent. The Imperial Bank is interested in so many commercial cases, that the position of the Manager, when plaintiff as well as Consul, must inevitably become somewhat delicate. Honorary Vice-Consul Mirza Nasrullah Khan proceeded on one year's leave to Shiraz, on the 27th March 1912. He returned before his leave had elapsed, on the 26th November 1912, after which he held charge of the Consulate till the end of the year. No steps were taken to supply his place during his absence, with the result that His Majesty's Consul (in this case a Persian Scholar) had to undertake his own vernacular correspondence and copying work, and to perform the outside duties of Consulate Mirza himself, or else depute them to the Mirza of the Bank. The disadvantages of such an arrangement are sufficiently obvious. The new system of Pinancing His Majesty's Consulates in Persia (under the control of the Government of India) laid down in the letter of the Govern ment of India in the Poreign Department, No. 2085-Est. A, dated 6th July 1912, was introduced with effect from 1st July 1912. It entailed a serious reduction in the funds of the Consulate, and the reduction of the staff by the senior of the two English clerks. Owing to the reduction of the grants and the exceptional expenses incurred on the relief during the year, both of the Escort and of the Consul, the new Office allowance was exceeded. As regards the reduction of the staff, this only took effect from the 13th September 1912, or shortly before the Consulate was deprived of a proper Consul. The new system of accounts has not yet, i i practice, produced a diminution of work in any way equivalent to the loss of the service of one clerk. The Indian Consular Escort was relieved on 5th August 1912, the detach ment of 10th Lancers being replaced by one of the 23rd Cavalry. Of the latter the 5 sowars came from Ahwaz on the reduction strength of the escort there, and the Daffadar came direct from India. Both escorts were much delayed en route by the insecurity of the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road. The new esort left Ahwaz on 2nd May 1912 and only reached Kerman on the aPERSIAN GrTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT 4tli August, while the old escort left Kerman on 13th September 1912 only reached Bandar Abbas on 23rd October 1912- The medical wants of the Consulate were atttened to by the _ Surgeon whose services are lent to the Indo-European Tele^aph Bepatfa by lc Government of India.

Subsequently, in Octolier, he was replaced by the Salar-i-Muayyad, son of the Amir-i-Mufakham. Charge of the Katguzari was held by the Wakil-ul-Mamalik, a and incapable youth, until 21st August when he resigned under orders from Tehran. During the remainder of the year acting charge was held by tk astute and capable and equally dishonest Mirza Habibullah Khan. During March the Karguzari was temporarily closed owing to a disagree ment between the Karguzar and the Governor-General. The principal event of the year in the Political sphere was the # revolt oi the district initiated by certain uncb Major events of the Year. strappers of the Governor General, asl carried on with the help of most of the tribal chiefs. The following is a W account of its origin, progress, and suppression :— In the month of March the Amir-i-Azam put Mirza Husein Bahadur-us-Sultaneh, a former head of Police, in charge of a force of men and 2 guns with instructions to visit the districts or Narmashir, E Jiruft, Aqta, Afshar, and Sirj an and collect the revenue. He started out foi Narmashir accompanied by the Enfat-i-Nazim. Both these were known to oe bad characters, and the Amir was warned against employing them, but tumei a deaf ear to his advisers. After practising great extortion in Bam and Narmashir, and plundering Salar A,lam Khan of Pusht-i-Gudar, the two colleagues proceeded to Ru(U On receiving orders from the Amir-i-Azam to make restoration to Alam Ji they returned insolent answers and raised the standard of revolt. Tliey w speedily joined by the Bahadur-ul-Mulk, ex-Governor of Jiruft, the sm Diwan of Jabal Bariz, and by the chiefs of Afshar and Buchaqchi who all sw an oath of mutual fidelity. The Zargham-i-Nizam of Eudbar sent a coutmg to join them, but avoided committing himself personally. The rebels advanced plundering and putting to flight Muhammad the new Governor of Jiruft, and seizing the Governor-General's . and 30 of his men, and they took up their quarters at Baft^witb a to o , about 1,000 men. They provisioned themselves from Rayin and imprisoned the governor of Pariz. They then proposed to march on ^ which was entirely defenceless. They entered into correspondence wi disloyal party of ' Democrats ' in Kerman city and began their adyanG^j^ no heed to letters addressed to them by the British and Russian ^ They finally encamped at Fathabad 8 or 9 miles from the town. &amp; ^ j following account of subsequent events in Colonel Haig's words w few verbal alterations:— ^ 'In the meantime the fears of the Governor-General incre^ed to day. The force at his disposal was inadequate, the Minister . -ir prina ii^ m direct communication with the rebels and had a.local agent m 0 the extent of the ' democratic ' movement in the town and among « was unknown, so that he did not know to whom to turn for help an was most difficult to restrain him from taking to flight, and at 6 224 pdfor the tear 1912. 51 heart entirely, declared that he could no longer be responsible for the safety of the Bank treasure and of Europeans, and, early on the morning of May 16th, fled from the city and sought the protection of the British Consul, encamping in a garden adjoining the Consulate. ' The Bank treasure had already been removed to the Consulate, a tele graph line had been run thither, and all Europeans had been warned to be prepared to take refuge at short notice. &lt;e At midnight, on May 16-17th, the Consul was called to the British tele graph office by His Majesty's Minister, with whom was the Minister of the Interior, and was told to bring the Governor General with him. The Persian Government at length promised to support the Governor General, to supply him with the necessary funds, and to approve all measures necessary for the restoration of order. On the strength of these promises the Consul was able, though not without difficulty, to persuade Amir-i-Azam to promise to return to town in the morning. At about 9-30 a. m . he returned to the town, pre ceded by the Consul, who had certain preliminary arrangements to make, and took up his quarters in the Persian Telegraph Office, within the citadel. The Superintendent, who was in league with the rebels, and was the channel of communication with the Minister of the Interior, was suspended, the leading ' democrats ' were arrested, and other measures necessary for the restoration of order were adopted. The rebels on this day cut all telegraph wires on both sides of the town and, as no payment of money had, up to this time, been sanctioned, the Consul obtained 5,000 tomans from the Imperial Bank of Persia for immediate needs. ' The Governor General still hesitated to attack the rebels and, on May 19th, the Consul found it necessary to visit them, as they appeared to be de luding themselves with the belief that it would be possible to detach him from Amir-i-Azam and obtain his support. In the course of two prolonged visits, on May 19 and 20, they were convinced that this was impossible, but they refused to send in representatives to negotiate with the Governor General. The Consul succeeded, however, in detaching from the rebels and bringing into town Muhammad Khan of Jiruft and between two and three hundred Afshars under Sowlet-ul-Mulk and two other leaders. The Governor General still remained inactive and continued negotiations after the time for them was past, but at length, on May 25th, was induced to attack the rebels. They had already begun a retrograde movement towards Baghin, and sent off all their plunder, but he attacked and defeated them, capturing one of their guns. They fled into Bardsir ( where they still are ), and in the course of their flight cut the telegraph wires at Baghin. The Governor General, however, failed ^to follow up his advantage and waited in the hope that a split might occur in the rebel camp, and that some might come in and submit. Some of the leading democrats were, in the meantime, banished from the town, and Basharat-ul- Mamalik, the Telegraph Master, was sent off to Tehran. ' On the afternoon of June 6th the Governor General, after much un necessary delay, marched from the town in pursuit of the remnant of the rebels. His movements were very leisurely. A few days later Bahadur-ul-Mulk -submitted to him and was followed by Ghunj Ali Khan, ex-Ilkhani of the Afshars. The latter was later imprisoned for the purpose of enforcing payment of arrears of revenue and of compensation for the damage done by the rebels. Agha Murad Khan, chief of the Buchaqchis, afterwards submitted and was told that he must surrender Mirza Husein Khan and Mirza Kasim. He requested that their lives might be spared, but was told that this was impossible. They were surrendered to the Prince at Mashiz, on the afternoon of June 17th and hanged on the morning of June 18th. This was satisfactory as there had been Teason to fear that the Prince would commit the fatal error of sparing their lives. Both Kerman and Bam were illuminated to celebrate their execution. ' The Prince then moved on to Turushab and engaged in endeavouring 3 I in#, to collect arrears of revenue and compensation from the rebels. He was said * rft to have received 10,000 tomans from Bahadur-ul-Mulk. ical# 1 : 'Several fugitives from the rebel camp, chiefly Baluch followers of : Eifat-i-Nizam, were intercepted in and near Rayin and taken into Bam, where n for#' they were stripped of their plunder and imprisoned. , 'pjjjjgjAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT oJ The remainder of the story may be summarised as follows ;--Befo t e k departure from the Province the Amir-i-Azam also had Ahbas Sabili, a panion of the Eifat -i-Nizam, blown from a gun. The treasure of the Imperial Bank of Persia was taken back, on July Jm from the British Consulate to the town The condition of the country, ever, subsequent to the departure of the Amir-i-Azam, continued to bedepl#. able The Ifshars and Buchaqchis plundered people and insulted women the town of Kerman and the surrounding villages, and were encouraged rati® than restrained by the Adl-us-Sultan, the only official m the place ml a ,, power. This man also connived at the escape ot the two imprisoned ciiefs Gunj Ali Khan Afshar and Husein Khan Buchaqchi, which he pleaded lij was powerless to prevent. What stands out in the history of this revolt is the levity of the Ukl leaders who allied themselves with men like the two arch conspirators, % utter want of initiative and pluck on the part of the Amir-i-Azam, who is now locally lauded as a hero, and the inability of the rebellious confederacy froni want of organisation and mutual trust to face the merest semblance of organised resistance. Einally, the intelligence, let alone the loyalty, of the ' Democratic' party in the town, is shown up as being of the^ meanest quality. Did they ever imagine that they would have any place in the sun in a scheme oi the world organised by the Afshars and Buchaqchis ? The Persian ' Demo crat ' is just a step more childish and contemptible than the Persian ' Aristocrat who at least shows some appreciation of his own immedialt interests. The firmness and common sense displayed by Colonel Haig in his dealiii, 5 with this situation, and his success in maintaining his Humpty Dumpty, tk Amir-i-Azam, on the top of his wall in security if not in dignity received ai immediate expression of approval from the British Government, who bestowed upon him the Companionship of St. Michael and St. George in recogni tion of his services. The Amir-i-Azam, destroyer of rebels, defender of Kerman, and now a popular hero, was by his grateful Government immediately dismissed from office. He now resides in private obscurity in the seclusion of his domains at Damaghan. Sic transit gloria mundi : but it is believed that a bf portion of the last year's revenues of Kerman enables him to sooth the bitter- ness of his spirit with material comforts. When the new Governor General, the Amir -i-Mufakham, appeared 01 the stage the province was in the state of confusion natural after an aliuos successful rebellion and the dismissal of the triumphant Government Ciiani' pion. Eaiding and robbery were rife in all the districts and on all the roads. The new Governor first spent a month in the Eafsinjan district and, wij his sons and Bakhtiari following, had several engagements with large bancs robbers which led to the establishment of security on the Yezd -Kerrnan ija The prestige so gained and the advance of the season had an immediate p elsewhere, and before the end of the year the rOads, which for ^ closed for caravan trade, were again open, and the post began their destinations. On the 30th September he entered Kerman city. Two P r0 ^ ems, j!l ever, at once presented themselves, first the supply of arms and ^niinn . and second that of funds—both essential requirements for a projecte i , tion into Baluchistan (which has for some years been practically mdep and a revenue collecting tour round the other districts. ^ A solution had not been found for either problem by the end of ^ Among the political matters of lesser importance which occuirect Minor Political Affairs. the year the following i -J 116 ^ti-foreign feeling and demonstrations which were in tfo Ainir ^A Were 01106 suppressed on his airFOR THE YEAR 1912. 53 The unsatisfactory conduct of the Sardar-i-Nusrat, in regard to the murder Sardar-i-Nusrat and his relations. 9^ Certain s and the anti f ji ei^n demonstrations, was mentioned in last year s report. In February, he was summoned to Tehran and eventually complied with the summons, his brother remaining in Kerman. The Adl-us-Sultan used all his powers of intrigue to have him brought back, and throw his influence into _ the scale against the new Governor, the Amir-i-Azam. Colonel Haig, writing in February 1912, says that this faction had, during the last two years at least, exercised all its influence against the appointment or retention of an efficient Governor General and that the destruction of its power should be of great advantage to Kerman. During and after the rebellion the behaviour of the family appears to have been ai best ambigous, and Colonel Haig believed them to be in league with the Afshar and Buchaqchi robbers. It has already been noted how, durino' the Adl-us-Sultan's tenure of power, he allowed these tribes to commit excesses m the town, and connived at the release of their leaders from prison. He also conducted a persecution of those who had been supporters of the Amir-i-Azam. Eventually the Sardar-i-Nusrat returned with the Amir-i-Mufakham having made his peace with the Legation and having probably been sufficiently bled tt ^ ,? ers ^ an Authorities to make him more discreet for some time to come. He and his brother attempted to ingratiate themselves again with the Consul. To their appeals Colonel Haig responded that bye-gones should be bye-^ones at the same time expounding to them, for their future guidance, the doctrine of by thdr fruits ye shall know them.' No further cause to complain of the family arose during the year. They owe their local influence to money, not force of character, and had previously been regarded as srood friends of the Con sulate. Owing to the circumstances the Consulate and Indo-European Telegraph Cases of Bast Department were in considerable request „ . ' as places of ''bast' or sanctuary. The lollowmg cases may be mentioned :— In Eebruary, the followers of the Muin-i-Diwan, Deputy Governor of Jabal Bariz, took 'bast' at the Indo-European Telegraph Department Office Bam, as a protest against that official's arrest by the Governor General. In April, the Amir-i-Azam's Private Secretary took ' bast ' at the Consulate. In May, the Amir-i-Azam took ' bast ' in proximity to the Consu late. In July, some 30 or 40 persons who had been on the side of the Amir-i- Azam took ' bast ' in the Consulate from the persecutions of the de facto Governor, the Adl-us-Sultan. These cases gave a considerable amount of trouble, and m some instances Parsi subjects were given letters of protection from the Consulate, on which they will probably seek to trade in the future. In October serious disturbances broke out in Sirjan, and the Governor, sirjan. Mirat-us-Sultan, was expelled from the Tv/r ^ ^ c i ^ towi1, Tlie Am i r -i-Mufakham sent the r* / j ! ' ! Sardar - 1 -^srat, to reinstate him. The rebels successfully cleienaed themselves, and negotiations were entered into. These were inter rupted by further fighting when, the sinews of war failing, on the part of the Crovernment forces, a truce was made. The Afshar chief, on his release from imprisonment in Kerman in July, TheAfshars. determined to try conclusions with the ■ m - * /» r o ^ , new Ilbegi of the Afshars, the Sowlet-ul- Mulk, Afshar, for which purpose he called in the assistance of Ears robbers He appears, however, to have got the worst of it and to have had to recognise t ?? 0 i US i gl i j i oither he, however, nor Earajullah Khan, Governor of ahr Babak, obeyed the Amir-i-Mufakham's summons to Rafsinjan. The state of affairs and parties in Baluchistan does not appear very clearly Baluchistan. from the Consulate records.54 PEBSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Sadi Khan, Sardar-i-Nizam, appears at the beginning of the year to l, been at war with Khan Muhammad Khan whom he plundered. Te Later on, in April, it was reported that Said Khan, Bahram Khan Ai Khan and Ghulam Easul Khan had divided up Western Baluchistan.'ainoT,! themselves for revenue purposes. In June, it was reported that Ali Shah Khan, chief of the Naruis Nusratabad, had joined Khudadad Khan in plundering the Sarhad district, In December, Said Khan again appears in public, firstly as attach Nawab Khan, and secondly as writing to the Governor General to sa? that he could not pay Malyat, but that Persia should be grateful to Mil for his loyalty in steadily withstanding the pressure of the British to join their side. At an earlier date he had sought to intervene to save the life of Eifat-i. Nizam by threatening to plunder Narmashir and Bam. He was too late. It is useless to dwell on this at length.

Apart from Baluch raids into Narmashir, etc., some 23 cases of raids and robberies are mentioned in the diaries for the year, and this list is probably far from com plete. Narmashir was raided by Baluchis almost continuously, improved at the end of the year when the Amir-i-Mufakham began to himself feared, and to some extent felt.

A Consul cannot acquire an insight into the characters of the various tribal and local chiefs, from working friendships with them or hope to acquire the smallest influence over them, when he is debarred from visiting the people in their own houses and haunts. Despite the part actually played by Colonel Haig in regard to the rebellion of 1912, His Majesty's Consul, on his way up from Bandar Abbas, never heard his name or existence mentioned though he discussed the matter with intelligent persons who displayed a know ledge of every detail of the rebellion itself.

Mr. E. C. Barker, O.I.E., held political charge of the Mekran Coast until p ersonnel the afternoon of 24th October 1912 when he proceeded to England to take up the post of Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. He was relieved by Mr. E. E. Gunter, Superintendent, Indian Telegraph Depart ment, who held charge for the remainder of the year. On account of the effective blockade of the Mekran Coast by the Eoyal Arms Traffic. Navy, the Baluchis were only successful in importing a very small quantity, of arms from Maskat. The landings and captures have been dealt with in a separate report. During the year Afghans confined themselves to purchasing arms locally from the Baluchis; very few came to the Coast. For the protec tion of the Telegraph line from Afghans and Baluchis who were incensed by captures of arms by the Eoyal Navy, the following Chiefs were granted permits to import rifles from Maskat.

It may be mentioned that, while the other chiefs of Persian Mekran were endeavonring to obtain permits for as many rifles as they could, Mir Tslam Khan, Chief of Bmt, made no request for permits, this may be because he was satisrying his requirements in some other way. Letters of introduction to the address of the chiefs were given to the Karachi Extension Railway. officers of the Karachi Extension Eailway • -r, , r , _ . who carried on their surveying operations in Persian Mekran during the year. They were hospitably received by the meis and given necessary assistance through their respective districts.58 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT The following chiefs were in receipt of telegraph subsidies, etc., year.

Receipts to the amount of Rs. 700 to be deducted from the subsidies, when due, were obtained through the efforts of the Munshi of this office from the representatives of Mir Din Muhammad Khan of Dashtiari and Mir Ahmed Khan of Bahu who came to Karachi in August last with the proper seals of their masters. The amount will be distributed to their creditors. After a lapse of ten years Rs. 63-8-5 only were recovered from the Political Department, Kalat, in full settlement of the claims of the Line establishment which amount to Rs. 950 on account of camels plundered by the late Muhammad Timer Khan, Nowsherwani, in the Kuntdar raid. On the 16th June, Mir Barkat plundered property worth Rs. 750-8-0 belonging to the Jask Sub-Division. The claims have been deferred until some good opportu nity occurs of recovering the amount. The Director proceeded on his annual tour about middle of March and Toui after inspection of the Telegraph Stations in the Persian Gulf returned to Karachi in April. He was met by Mir Barkat outside Jask where the conditions men tioned in Mr. Gumbley's report were discussed with him. As he did not show any inclination to come to terms, the negotiations were broken off. Mir Barkat left for Bashkard. During his stay at Charbar, the Director saw the represen tatives of the chiefs of Dashtiari and Bahu, the chiefs themselves were away at Bampur. Such other events as occurred during the year, are mentioned in the reports of the respective districts. Jask. Mr. 0. H.

GUNTER, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, In Political Charge, Mehran Coast. ME. D. W. M. GUMBLEY'S EEPOBT ON THE CONDITION OE THE COUNTRY BETWEEN BIYABAN AND GWADUR EOE THE YEAR 1912. Mir Haji has remained Chief of Biyaban throughout the year, and the Biyaban District. strained relationship between him and Mir Barkat has continued. This has caused a good deal of looting of which the following are the chief incidents. On May 13th Barkat was reported to have seized Qualamni and to have looted the whole of the country round it. In June, Muhammaduk, brother of Barkat, murdered one Shahsowar, the Headman of Kuhistak, together with his son and four followers. One of Muhammaduk's men was also killed. A few weeks later he looted a number of camels from Goshki but most of these he returned to their owners on receipt of a certain sum of money for each camel; some three or four, however, were retained. Towards the end of July Mir Haji and his son, Gul Muhammad, managed to surround Muhammaduk and seven of his men near Goshki. After four hours fighting Muhammaduk's brother arrived on the scene and begged Mir Haji to desist. The latter said he would make peace and let Muhammaduk go if he would return the stolen camels above referred to. This was agreed to and Muhammaduk coming down from the hill he occupied sat under a tree await ing Mir Haji when he was treacherously shot dead with four of his followers by Mir Haji's men. On bearing of this Barkat collected a following and, on the 7th August, came down to Bazgir, between Sirik and Seekoei, where he burnt over a hundred huts and looted the country. One old woman of Bazgir was killed during the raid. Suleiman Nawab, seeing the flames of the burning village from Sarzeh, collected a following and marched to Bazgir which was reached in the early morning He attacked the looters of whom he killed one and wounded another before driving them off. Some two or three weeks later Barkat's followers, marching towards Bazgir, entered the house of Ibrahim Nawab, brother of the above mentioned Suleiman, and put him to death. Barkat's men then marched towards Goshki but found the Goshki Pass held by Mir Haji. In the fight which ensued Barkat's party were defeated and retreated to Kuhistak each side losing one man. In September Barkat looted a number of camels from Biyaban. This he did as a means of raising money and returned the camels to their owners on their paying about a third of the value of the camels. The condition of the Jask District has not been satisfactory nor has the Jask District. bahaviour of Mir Mustafa Khan been all that could be desired. He has spent the greater part of the year away from Jask, much of the time with Barkat in Bashkard. He professes to be afraid of incurring Barkat's displeasure if he lives in J ask at peace with Government and at the same time fears the dis approval of the Sirkar on account of the lengthy and frequent periods for which he absents himself from his district. This position troubles him a good deal, but he is too weak-minded to follow any definite policy and vacilates in accord ance with the degree of fear he feels for Barkat or the Government. Karachi; The 20th January 1913,02 PERSIAN auir ADMINISTRATION REPORT On March 15th after Nasmllah, the Persian in charge of the JagV had unsuccessfully tried to collect some taxes from the Looran vilW* !?' latter were hauling a boat belonging to Messrs. Duarte Brothers on to L i tJl ? when the Persian Sarbaz from the Port approached. The Baluchis been? frightened walked away but were chased by the Persians. On getting to? quarters the latter again asked the Baluchis if they intended paying the u demanded ; the reply from the Loorames was that they had paid their tail ? Mustafa Khan, the Chief, and did not intend paying them again, where! the Persian soldiers opened fire on them killing Esau Dilwash and Mound Pudulla, Abdullah Muhammad, Ibrahim Muhammad, Haji Kassim and jJ Zangie. On the 17th, 70 or 80 Baluchis under Murad came in in a Tery excfi state with the intention of besieging the Port and revenging themselves on I Persians. They were however dissuaded and the Sarbazes were sent W to Bushire by the next mail. At the end of March Mir Barkat wrote that b would like to come in to see me if I was willing to receive him and ^onlj gurantee him safe conduct. This was done and we met five and a half mil® outside the Jask station on 5th April. _ He was most profuse in his profession of friendship and expressed himself willing to do ^ anything we required, but I was unable to induce him to promise to come into the station to meet tb Director on his arrival as he had a great fear of the Military force stationei there. A meeting was eventually arranged on the banks of the Jask creek ani took place on the 13th April, Barkat being accompanied by about a hM armed followers. During the interview the Director explained to Mir Barkat that, as a condition of our recognition of him, we should require him to agree to the following :— (a) that he should reside in Jask permanently and not leaie it without our knowledge; (b) that he should abstain absolutely from either direct or indirect con* nection with the slave traffic, arms traffic and Afghans; (c) that he should deposit say Es. 10,000 as security for his adherence to the above conditions. He agreed to the second condition but, with regard to (a), he said he coi not agree to live permanently in Jask as his means of livelihood were k Bashkard. This condition was then gradually reduced till he was asked to fe one month in three in Jask but, as he still refused to do this, the discussion oi this clause was dropped. With regard to (c) he said that he had been deprive! of his territory for two years and was unable to find the required security, Mt that he would be able to find the amount three months after he was reinstate! He was asked if he could find half the amount at once but said he could not do so. Pinding that he was unwilling to agree to the terms offered the intei' view was brought to a close. He promised to return and live quietly in Bast- kard until such time as he could accept the terms offered to him by GroTerIl■ ment, but instead of doing so he instigated most of the raids described in tjaj part of this report dealing with Biyaban and Jask. I have since heard tM the real reason that Barkat refused the terms offered him was that when he w pressed to live in Old Jask he became convinced that we asked this so that^ should be able to capture him. Mullah Dadshah, the venerable and well disposed father — . was murdered by Barkat's slaves on the night of the 27th April. The moij for this cowardly crime was apparently that Mullah Dadshah was friendly 10 he British Government and Barkat wished to shew that he would cause an aluch, fnendly to us, to suffer whatever his standing. He no doubt cod dered that if he could make himself sufficiently troublesome to us we * e wi ling to recognise him on his own terms. , vrm-n^ Sth Barkat's faction under Abdulla Dervish and Mir f 0 ll 0 wing villages to the north of Jask Bay: .

This may result in a blood feud. Sardar Saiyid Khan has been in Bampur as Persian Governor of Baluchis- Gaih District. t . an throughout the year with the excep tion of a few weeks when he came down to Lashar to settle a dispute between Islam Khan and his brother, Mirza Khan. The Sardar's eldest son, Mehrab Khan, formerly known as Pir Bukhsh, has been left in Gaih in charge of the district. Hakim Khan with six or seven Afghan companions has been wandering round the Bint and Karwan districts of Gaih for most of the year purchasing arms and ammunition. The year in the Gaih district has been uneventful but the number of slaves that have been exported is larger than usual. In this regard it is noticeable that the trade has not been confined to negroes but has been extended to the poorer classes of Baluchis who are caught and sold into bondage at the Arab ports. The unfriendly feeling between Mahmud Khan and Mir Din Muhammad Dashtiari District. continues; the former seems to resent the fact that his nephew. Din Muhammad, draws an equal share of the revenue of Dashtiari with himself. He considers his age should entitle him to a greater share. In July Mir Bachu, Sardar Din Muhammad's Agent, and his nephew, Noor Muhammad, were shot dead at Jagger Koh in Dashtiari by Mir Abdul Wahid, Said Muhammad, Gholam Khan and Haibut Khan. The cause was that Mir Bachu had married a girl to whom Abdul Wahid was engaged. Nothing of interest has taken place in the Bahu district which continues Bahu District. to . be administered by Mir Ashraf and Mir Ahmed. Slaves.

Maior L. B. H. Haworth held the office of Consul throughout tk Major Haworth was on leaye during the month of February, during whicli time Captain Grey officiated. Captain Grey was away from Headquarters in connection with Bakhtiari affairs, from the 14th April till the 20tli October. Mr. W. N. Siqueira continued as Dragoman and Mirza Ahmed Khan as Mirza. Ijlal-es-Saltaneh arrived at Shushtar early in June and took up his ap- pointment as Governor of Arabistan, Loc»i officials. Since he was the brother of Sadik-es-8ol. taneh, the Persian Commissioner with the Oil Company, it was hoped that lie would prove a capable man. He turned out, however, to be as weak and corrupt as the ordinary Persian Governor, and, being without force, was unaWe to effect any improvement in the situation at Shushtar, Dizful or the surround' ing country. In a very short time he came into opposition with the people through his desire for 'mudakhil ' or illicit income. Soon after his arrival he sent totk Shaikh for assistance to quell local disturbances, which assistance the Shal refused until such time as the demand should be confirmed by the Persiai Government. Ijlal-es-Sultaneh succeeded in maintaining a fluctuating Govermneit throughout the year and still continues in his position. Vaqar-ul-Mulk was appointed Deputy-Governor and took up his duties at the beginning of April. He continued in that post until September, wlien he was dismissed, Muayid-ul-Mamalik being appointed in his place. On the Customs Department taking over charge of the Eevenues the Go vernor-General presented his accounts which were found to be quite impossii It appeared that he had already drawn considerably more than he was entitled to and his accounts were still under review at the end of the year. Mustaufi-ul-Mulk was relieved of his duties as Rais -i-Malieh and arrivei Revemie from Ahwaz on the 10th December on ^ way to Tehran. Amir Khan, a British subject, arrived from Tehran on the 21st Novemte to take up the appointment but has not as yet succeeded in doing so, owing J the Belgians having assumed charge of the Eevenue Department and hayu? placed the work in the hands of their own men.

Captain James, I.M.S., eldest son, continued as Governor at Ahwaz. His mother takes a large share in the Government and appears to be a most m{ Medical. Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf, has kindly- supplied-me with the following note. The health of Mohammerah during the year 1912, in so far as infectious diseases are concerned, has been good, no epidemics having occurred. Two cases of plague were landed from ships arriving from Bushire, but were detained in the Quarantine station and no cases were introduced into the town. As far as the general health of the town is concerned it is impossible to speak with any accuracy, the Government dispensary affecting merely a fringe of the population, the bulk of whom treat themselves, or are treated by local hakims. The return of attendances at the charitable dispensary shows an increase the figures being 3,395 for 1912, as against of the previous year, , it fas U 2,909 tor mi. The most common diseases in order of their frequency were Diseases of the eye „ of the digestive system Injuries Malaria Diseases of the skin Venereal diseases . • 491 487 352 312 265 220 No statistics are available to show the mortality from various diseases occur ring in the town. Eye diseases are exceedingly common amongst the population. The absence of any form of conservancy, the presence of filth and refuse in the streets and on the river banks, and the consequent plague of flies together with the utter lack of cleanliness, more especially amongst the women and children, result in the infection of the eyes of a large proportion of the latter. In the absence of treatment permanent disfigurement follows in many cases. Malaria is probably more common than would appear from the returns. The greatest prevalence is shown in the quarter from April to June. Creeks dug for the irrigation of the palm gardens form an excellent breeding ground for mosquitoes and, as the local inhabitant builds his hut on the bank of some creek, small or large, the conditions for the propagation of malaria could not be better. The water of the creek is also used for every possible domestic purpose, the creek being a depository for the household filth and at the same time the source of the household supply of drinking water. Diseases of the alimentary tract are therefore always present though long use would appear to have conferred on the people a surprising immunity. Venereal disease is also probably more frequent than would appear from the returns. Minor operations to the number of 66, consisting of dental extractions, incision of abscesses, removal of foreign bodies, etc., were performed. There being no accommodation and no possible operating room major opera tions are impossible. Cases both medical and surgical which need indoor treatment have to be sent away without relief, and the work of the dispensary is confined to the treat ment of minor ills. Proper accommodation and an adequate staff would increase the utility of the dispensary fourfold, and the task of overcoming the ignorance and prejudi ces of the people and of obtaining their confidence would be greatly simplified. On May 16th Monsieur Fourman took over charge of the Customs Depart^ Customt; ment at Mohammerah, Monsieur Delcroix the previous incumbent being transferred to Tehran.66 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT As reported last year, the state of the Customs had been far tory/ On Monsieur Eourman's arrival he saw that it would be do anything towards improving matters as long as he had to work witUp staff which Monsieur Delcroix had collected and he informed His Mai J Consul that he proposed to go slowly, but to weed them out one by one. 1 The most important person to be got rid of was Shoukat-es -Sultan [i Inspector, who had had Monsieur Delcroix completely under his thumb, fc sieur Fourman was able to get him removed to another post. The next important change was the transfer to Bushire of an Armeniaii, Baghdadlian bv name, Chief Verificator of Customs and the head of tlie elk who had so successfully defrauded his department. As he did not proceed® transfer on the date ordered Monsieur Fourman took the opportunity to dismig him. In the meantime most of the others who had served with ' croix were either dismissed or,transferred, one or two being su out in defrauding the Customs. Monsieur Abi, a Jew, formerly a teacher in the Alliance Isr manshah, continued as assistant to Monsieur Fourman and appears to be right hand man. With his newly constituted staff Monsieur Ponrman k done much to improve matters and is respected by the people of the town, era by the merchants who are losing by not being able to defraud the Customssi successfully as in the past. Naturally the Augean stable has not been absolute ly cleaned, nor could one hope for so desirable an end in Persia, but whatb been done is highly to be commended. Monsieur Fourman is a conscientid worker and I feel convinced that he is not anti-English. In June Monsieur Bouckaert took over the appointment of Director al Ahwaz. Shoukat-es-Sultan had been acting since the transfer of Monsiem Fourman. Monsieur Bouckaert appears to be strongly pro-German but tok otherwise harmless. With the appointment of Monsieur Mornard as Treasurer-General to came a tendency to place every administe Belgian Officials, tion in the charge of the Belgian Custom officials and nowhere was this more marked than in Arabistan, where the Kro tors of Customs had previously complained that one man was unable to coff with the work. In succession Passports, Posts, Telegraphs and finally KeTeffl have come into the hands of this overworked official with the result that, nffl to the Shaikh, the Belgian Customs Director has become, for the Persian,® most important person in Arabistan. The Governor of the Province hiw receives his salary and has his accounts checked by the Customs DepaitWi and it can easily be realised the importance this gives, in an Oriental countrj to the officials of the administration which is entrusted with that work. It is doubtful whether the Customs Department will even be able to ca trol the revenues successfully, as at present organised. The Mustaufi ot e have always conducted their accounts on a system which is understood on n themselves and which even a Persian would find difficulty in following retiring revenue officer, the Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik remarked to His Maw Consul that the mere translating of documents, etc., so as to make them in gible to the Customs Director, was a difficulty which seemed insurmoun. An entirely new system would seem necessary as the only solution difficulty. ^ With the growth of Mohammerah, and perhaps more especially British Port Office. the work of the British Post .,, , steadily increased during tne wi be seen from the following figures of the receipts and output: 1912. Ordinary letters received for delivery . . 43,920 47,964 Begistered Books, etc., etc. Newspapers Parcels .

This request was readily agreed to since the great bulk of the work comes on the two days between the arrival of the mail and its departure. Accordingly, in July, an Assistant was sanctioned. The pay was however too small to obtain anyone locally in a place where clerical labour is so much in demand, and it is hoped that an assistant will be des patched from India. The Persian Postal Department was taken over by the Belgian Customs officials in June 1912. In Persian Posts. ,xi e j i • the same month of the previous year His Majesty's Consul was approached by the Governor of the town at the instance of the Shaikh with a view to the establishment of a Persian post office at Abadan. The query was made on instructions from Tehran and a reply was given that, should the Persian Government have any such desire, the correct course would be to approach the British Legation in Tehran. The subject was not renewed and nothing further was heard of it till November of this year, when it was announced that post offices would be instituted at Buzi, Mashur and Hindian, and it was rumoured that there were similar intentions regarding Abadan. Shahzadah Ahmed Mirza of the local Customs left Mohammerah in November to open the three first named offices at places where post offices had formerly existed but which had been closed as it had been found impossible to make them pay. On the evening of the 24jth December a notice was sent to this Consulate, by the Director of Customs in his Postal capacity, saying that a post office would be opened at Abadan. On receiving this notification His Majesty's Consul wrote asking where the post office was situated, and on being informed that it was in the office which had been rented to the Customs Department, for Customs purposes, within the limits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession, wrote to the Director of Customs saying that it could not be allowed without the permission of the British Legation. His Majesty's Minister on being informed of the circumstances of the case issued instructions to this Consulate to the effect that the objection which had been made was to be maintained. It is difficult to understand the conduct of the Belgian administration in the matter. It was evident that they expected that objections would be made to the line of action which they were taking, indeed private information is available confirming this fact. It would be difficult to imagine that it could be otherwise since they were placing a Persian Government office on ground conceded to a British company, without asking the permission either of that company or of the British Government. That any objection made by the Oil Company could be upheld was equally evident since, apart from political considerations, no company could permit of the inconvenience which would be caused by their private land being turned into a public thoroughfare: with the Oil Company this objection was all the stronger owing to the danger which might result through the inflammable nature of their products. That some ulterior motive underlies these institutions is clear, if only from the manner of their inception. The post office at Abadan may have been intended to form a base of attack upon the British post office at Mohammerah, it can hardly have been intended simply to annoy. At the close of the year the matter was still under reference but has since been satisfactorily settled by the local Director receiving orders to act in consultation with His Majesty^ Consul, and the post office has been suspended pending final orders from Tehran to close it. The telegraph line, Mohammerah-Ahwaz-Bushire, which forms the connection with Tehran, has hardly Telegraphs. worked during the year under report, K 2gg persian, gulf administration report with the exception of the portion Eamuz-Behbehan which has been in exister,« at intervals. The remainder of the line ceased to work before the grain seal began. The repairs effected by Mr. Christmas of the Indo-European Department, as reported last year, were very soon allowed to lapse int?tS normal conditio^ and it became apparent that the line 'Vould never work under native control. Many complaints were received from the local firms who in October 1911, had addressed a joint letter to His Majesty's Consul expressing the great loss incurred by British companies owing to the existing condition of affairs. They pointed out that they were unable to obtain their grain rate from home or their exchange rates from Tehran within a reasonable time and that, further, since the war with Turkey, they could not even send their coded messages via Basrah. Rates from Tehran were frequently useless when they arrived and were, indeed, sometimes an actual cause of loss owing to the delay in their f delivery. A similar complaint was repeated in August 1912, hut made jointly to their head offices in London. These Complaints were forwarded on, strongly supported, but His Majesty's Government were already engaged in pressing forward the Arabistan Convention giving the control of the lines to the Indo-European Telegraph Department. This convention was finally signed soon after the close of the year, and it is to be hoped that work on the section will soon be commenced. In August, on information received from the Resident, His Majesty's r Consul searched the S.S. ' Bahrain,' of the Arab Steamship Company, for arm which it was suspected were contained in bags of lime which had been exported from Maskat, by one Gabriel. Among the bags of lime were found concealed 23 rifles and two packages which appeared to be filled with ammunition but which, on being subsequently opened up, were found to contain automatic pistols.

Agha Abdi continued as the Company's agent on behalf of the Shaikh. Messrs. Lynch Brothers —Mr. 'W Martin arrived from Baghdad and took over charge of the local office. Messrs. MacAndrews and Forbes. —In the month of February, Messrs. MacAndrews and Eorbes, an American firm of liquorice exporters of Baghdad and elsewhere, whose employes in these parts are all British subjects, formed a company registered in London and attempted to open up a business with the liquorice growing in Arabistan. Having obtained from the Shaikh a monopoly for the digging and export of all the root growing in his limits at an annual rental of L.^OO, they started work on the Upper Diz They were however unable to get diggers at reasonable rates and accordingly closed down for the hot weather, On starting work in the autumn Mr. Moynihan, the manager, found the difficulties insuperable and has accordingly completely abandoned the venture and has returned to England. He states that the liquorice would repay work ing if managed by a local company in conjunction with other interests, but that, m present circumstances, it would not pay a company to keep up a special staff lor toe purpose. He has however stated to His Majesty's Consul that, should the Klioremmabad Eailway be built in the immediate future, his firm would once more attempt to take up the question. His Majesty's Consul convened a meeting at the Consulate consisting of Chamber of Commerce. the heads of the local British firms with , . , a view to the formation of a British Cham ber ot Commerce which it was felt was a necessity, both for the assistance and development of trade and also owing to the many questions which were arising locally and on which joint action was otherwise difficult. The idea was readily taken up and a Committee formed which had by the c.ose of the year drawn up its rules and regulations which were to be placed before a general meeting for sanction and adoption.

Last year it was reported that 'the old question of the Bakhtiari rivalrv has been dangerous ' while under the heading 'Shushtar 'it was anticipated tnat lurther trouble might be expected. „ , l ® le anticipated trouble developed itself on the arrival of the executive a itian Khans on their annual visit to Arabistan in the early spring.70 PE11SIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Last year closed with tlie Shaikh's Deputy acting as Deputy Govern Shushtar after the Shaikh had restored, order iu that place, at the sue ki 1 urgent request of the Persian Government. The executive Khans on I v their winter quarters, at Ab-bid, north of Shushtar, informed the Shaikh unless his Deputy were removed from the town immediately he would betn out by force. ^ The situation becoming critical, after reference to His Majesty's Mini t and to the Eesident, it was agreed by the^ Chiefs of both sides that the points I issue should be discussed by representatives of both sides in the presence oft? British Consular officers for Arabistan and Ahwaz. The Shaikh, relying on this meeting, had taken small precautions to protect himself : the Khans in Tehran also had promised the Legation that no hostile movement should take place. The Shaikh then realised too late that the local Executive Khans proposei to make good the threats which they had made against him and he had but j few Arabs in Shushtar when, at the end of April, the Bakhtiaris attacked ani took that town. On seeing the stage which matters had reached the Shaikh collected at Naseri an army of some ten to fifteen thousand men and proceeded to maicl on Shushtar. In the meantime the Khans in Tehran promised the Legatioi that the town should be evacuated. This, however, was not done till the daj the Shaikh's forces advanced from Ahwaz whereon the Khans retired to tte own country by double marches. This evacuation was claimed to be the result of orders which had been issuel from Tehran. This would not, however, appear to be very probable since, wi at Shushtar, the executive Khans were writing letters to the tribes around asking them to join them in attacking the Shaikh and boasting that they would tab Ahwaz and even Mohammerah. The Arab conuugent then occupied Shushtar but, on being informed througl the Minister and His Majesty's Consul that tlieie would be no further hosi movement against him, the Shaikh immediately disbanded his forces. At tk request of the Persian Deputy Governor who had, previous to this, arrived at lis post, a few men were left at his disposal to assist him in keeping order. An incident, however, occurred which has been the cause of much suk quent trouble. The forces on both sides, Arab or Bakhtiari, are composed of irregulai troops with the smallest amount of discipline : there is, it need hardly be saii, no commissariat department yet men and horses have to be fed. Thus an ariiij lives on the country through which it passes and is not an unmixed blessing,W a friendly or a hostile force.

The Jarrahi lands lie in the heart of the Shaikh's country and their posses sion by a hostile tribe would place him in such a vulnerable position that he immediately refused to acknowledge the sale claiming on behalf of his tribes the right of pre-emption. He stated to His Majesty's Consul that, sooner than allow the Bakhtiari t 0 occupy a position so vital to his well-being, he would fight the question out with them once and for all. In July the Sardar Jang was appointed Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris with full powers, and was instructed to settle outstanding questions with the Shaikh. He informed the Minister that he would sell the Jarrahi lands to the Shaikh and asked that a confidential message to that effect might be sent to the Shaikh through the Consul at Mohammerah. The Shaikh was still very nervous about the Bakhtiari movement for he stated that from previous experience he had no great cause to believe in the good faith of that tribe. ^ Finally he accepted the position on the recommendation of His Majesty's Minister who telegraphed that he was convinced of the good intention of the Bakhtiari and said that he was certain that if the Shaikh would be less suspicious all would go well : he added that since Sardar Jang had asked him to inform the Shaikh that he need fear no aggressive movement on the part of the Bakhtiaris, the fact that these assurances had been given through the Legation should be sufficient to re-assure the Shaikh completely. In October, one Rahim Khan, Arshad-ed-Dowleh, a maternal uncle of the Sardar Jang, arrived, bearing letters, from the latter to the Shaikh and to Haji Rais, in which it was stated that he was a person thoroughly to be trusted: the letters further stated that he had received full instructions and was the Sardar Jang's agent for the purpose of making an agreement with the Shaikh, with a view to putting an end to the present differences. The Shaikh received the Arshad-ed-Dowleh as a duly accredited agent of the Sardar Jang and made various agreements with him which only awaited the ratification and signature of his principal. Later the Sardar Jang complete ly disowned his agent, stating that he was quite unauthorised, notwithstanding the fact that the letters introducing him were actually in the Sardar Jane's own handwriting. The matter now assumed a new phase. The Sardar Jang, who had arrived on the borders of Arabistan, at one moment demanded large sums for the Jarrahi lands, at another stated openly that he had no intention of selling them and that they were required for the Bakhtiaris who would if necessary occupy them by force. He also demanded large sums as compensation for the Aqili raid, to which I have previously referred. On this in December the Shaikh proceeded to Nasiri and having collected his headmen around him, in case it was necessary for him to call upon his tribes to defend the Jarrahi lands, began to make all necessary preparations for defence. So the position remained at the end of the year.

His Majesty's Consul has heard of cases during the past year in which the Shaikh has had to use strong measures. With such a state of affairs as that72 PEESIAN GULP ADMINISTRATION EEPOET which has existed between himself and the Bakhtiaris in recent times amount of intrigue is bound to occur among those who for the time haml t ? discontented and of such there are always some in any Oriental count w K If _i?

Some of the Arabs of Eailiayah have shown restiveness but nevertheless the Shaikh has steadily consolidated his u and has been gaining more influence with the Arabs around. There has been no cause for the complaint made by the Sardar Assad tt the Shaikh has oppressed his people unduly. The town of Mohammerah has been quiet and shows signs of increasin prosperity. The Governor, Agha Abdi, is a man of the old school who J neither read nor write and will hardlv be able to deal with the situation ^1 the town develops, as it must do with the arrival of the railway. Captain James has noted on the want of sanitation in the streets of tie town, but I have little doubt that, when the time comes, the Shaikh will folk any advice we may give him with a view to bringing things onto, amoif modern footing. The Governor's rule is autocratic in all matters connected with the dispe^ ing of justice, but there has been no complaint to make from the point of i of this Consulate. The Shiakli has realised the importance of improving communicationsii the town and has placed the arrangements for a road from the river to thetoi in the hands of His Majesty's Consul.

A loan was accord ingly arranged through the Imperial Bank of Persia, but before it was complet ed, the Nizam, evidently acting on private information, found it desirable to leave Persia hurriedly. (A telegram which arrived immediately on his depar ture cancelled the permission he had received to go to Europe except vid Tehran). In the circumstances the Shaikh agreed to push through the loan of 70,000 tomans in his own name and to liquidate the debt to the Russian Bank, receiv ing as security for the debt the temporary control of all the Nizam's lands in Arabistan and the south of Persia. As the Shaikh has backed the undertakings which the Nizam has given us the arrangement is satisfactory. The relations between His Majesty's Consulate and the Shaikh have been Relations with the shaikh. excellent throughout the year. His Ex cellency has done everything that he can to show his appreciation of the favourable position which he holds with respect to the British Government and has given us constant practical proofs of his goodwill. In the summer, when the Turco-Persian frontier question was to the fore, he received the thanks of Sir Edward Grey for the readiness with which he ac cepted our views and propositions. In November he gave to His Majesty's Government an option over the whole of the shores of the Khor Musa and its tributaries to a distance of a mile inland, an undertaking which should prove of great value should we extend the railway to that place. Por this option the Shaikh received the thanks of His Majesty's Government. The present Consulate being hardly worthy of the British Government when compared with the fine buildings erected by the local firms, it has been decided to build something more suitable. In September His Excellency pre sented lis with an excellent site on the Eiver Karun, two acres in extent, for the erection of a new Consulate. The land has been given on a free lease for sixty years. The above will show the feelings by which the Shaikh is now actuated to wards us and it is to be trusted that the feeling will continue, and that the bonds by which he is drawn to the British Government will become closer and ^ firmer as time passes on, to our mutual benefit.

Incendiarism, which was at first suggested^ has nothing to support it as a theory beyond that an attempt had once previously been made to burn down the Oil Company's house. In that case however discharged boatmen were suspected while in the case of the Consulate there was no suspicion against anyone. The re-organisati on of the otnce has given considerable work. L.

In March Captain Grey received his commission as Yice-Consul, and the local rank of Consul, which the incumbent of the post had hitherto was abolished. The duties of the post were not however materially altered. Captain Grey was instructed that his position and duties as regards Bakhtiari and Luristan re mained as before and that he was to consider these his primary duties, 'but tit, when in Arabistan, he would be under the orders of His Majesty's Consul Mohammerah, and would exercise no independent Consular powers within the latter's jurisdiction.

Bahhtiari. —Najaf Kuli Khan, Samsam-es-Sultaneh, and Ghulam Husein Khan, Sardar Muhtesham, continued as Ilkhani and Ilbegi of the Bakhtiaris during the year under report. They were, however, absent from Bakhtiari territory throughout the year, and the tribal administration was carried on by Muntazzim-ud-Dowleh and Salari-Ashraf, the former as Ilkhani and the latter as Ilbegi. Owing to the chaos which resulted from the lax and corrupt adminis tration of these two young chiefs the senior chiefs were in July obliged to deprive them of their appointments and, under pressure from His Majesty's Legation, appointed Sardar-i-Jang, of the Haji Ilkhani family, to the Ilkhaniship of the whole tribe. Murteza Kuli Khan received the appointment of Ilbegi but^ Sardar-i-Jang was empowered to change the Ilbegi if he thought advisable provided the appointment was always filled by a member of the Ilkhani family. Kuhgelu.—Ai the commencement of the year Amir Mujahid was nominally Governor of Behbehan and the Kuhgelu tribes but had not taken over his appointment, Bahadur-i-Diwan continuing to act as Deputy Governor of the town. In March Amir Mujahid finally left Ispahan for Behbehan arriving at Malamir on .the 25th March. He halted for 10 days at the latter place to collect sowars^, et cetera, and reached Eamuz on the 5th April. He remained at Eamuz about a month when, owing to the intrigues of the Haji Ilkhani family with the Kuhgelu, he was forced to abandon his appointment and return to his house at Shamsabad. In July Sardar-i-Jang was appointed to the Governorship of Behbehan and Kuhgelu and deputed Amir Mujahid to the governorship of Behbehan and Kuhgelu The Amir arrived at Eamuz on the 18th October and entered Beh behan on the 15th November. Monsieur Eourman was Director of Customs in Nasiri till June when he Custoins&gt; was transferred to Mohammerah. His place was filled by Monsieur Bouckaert who remained in charge till the close of the year under report. In the commencement of the year Messrs. Lynch Brothers notified mer chants that they would be charged warehouse fees for goods remaining on their seifs for a longer period than seven days. This notification was necessitated by the fact that merchants had adopted the practice of not taking delivery of their goods when, owing to closure of the road or scarcity of transport, they were unable to forward up country. Messrs. Lynch Brothers' 4 seif' is, by an arrange ment with the Customs Department, considered a bonded warehouse and the merchants by leaving their goods there avoided paying customs' dues. The Customs Department insisted, under their regulations, in charging ground rent as before on uncleared goods and the merchants thus found them selves called upon to pay two ground rents on the same goods. In October a meeting was held, at which the chief merchants, the Director of Customs and Messrs. Lynch's agent were present, to discuss the matter and it was decided that the question should be referred to Tehran with the recommen dation that the Customs should in future charge half of the ordinary ground rent fees and Messrs, Lynch Brothers an equal amount : thus making the total fees payable by merchants on uncleared goods the same as at other Gulf ports. No reply had been received to the Customs Director's recommendations at the close of the year. No friction was experienced between the Customs Department and British firms during the year under report. Fusht-i-Kuh. —Pusht-i-Kuh like Arabistan has, during the past year. Condition of Country. l)ee . ]1 0ne of tlie feW COmers of Persia which has remained unaffected and peace ful during the chaps which has reigned elsewhere. The Wali, Amir-i-Jang, has administered his territory with his usual firmness and ability with the' result that his people have remained quiet and contented. His son, Amanullah70 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Khan, has not indulged in his usual rebellions against his father, and the WoK felt sufficient confidence in him to release him m October from Ms virtual imprisonment in Huliran. In July Salar-ed-Dowleh fled from Kermanshah, on the arrival of Farman Earma, and proceeded to Deh Bala where he asked the Wali to aid him in expelling Parman Earma from Kermanshah. The Wali refused to do so and Salar-ed-Dowleh left for Luristan and Kurdistan. In the month of February the Wali, on learning of the strained relations existing between the Shaikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtiari Khans, ofed to assist the former in the event of hostilities. This offer was declined bytlie Shaikh as there appeared at the time to be no danger of a rupture. In tii e end of April when hostilities had actually broken out the Shaikh reminded the Wali of his promises of support. The Wali replied that he had left for his 'Ilaq and was not in a position to arrange to send a force for the Sliaikli 's help. The Shaikh's subseqent policy in regard to the Bakhtiari Khans in break- ing off his friendly relations with the Haji Ilkhani family and attempting to establish a friendship with the Ilkhani family without keeping the Wai informed of his intentions caused some annoyance to the latter and at the close of the year the friendship between the two chiefs had undergone considerable cooling off. Luristan.^Qi\i&amp;os has reigned supreme throughout Luristan during tlie year. The Lur chiefs have come to regard themselves as practically indepen dent of the control of the Central Government, and a hard task awaits anj Persian official who may be appointed to quiet the country in the future. All those appointed to the Governorship of Luristan during the year were Lur tribal chiefs with the single exception of Sardar Said, and this individual did not succeed in entering Luristan at all. To the tribal chiefs their appointment as Governor-General made no differ ence whatever. They did not attempt to interfere with their neighbouring and friendly tribes, and devoted their whole energies to enriching themselves at the expense of the townspeople of Burujird or Khoremmabad as the case might be. Needless to say the result of this state of things has been disastrous to the commercial prosperity of the province. The trade of the two chief towns— Buru- jird and Khoremmabad with Dizful in the south and Hamadan and Kerman shah in the north—has practically ceased. Such rare caravans as have passed over the trade routes of the province have done so under the protection of tribal escorts hired at exorbitant rates. In September the Resident in the Persian Gulf urged upon the Government of India the necessity of deputing an officer to Dizful with the object of improv* ing our knowledge of Luristan and extending our influence in the province. The proposal was still under consideration by the Government of India at the close of the year. Bakhtiari. —At the commencement of the year under report the acting executive Chiefs—Salar-i-Ashraf and Muntazzim-ed-Dowleh—were in the Bak tiari low country,. They were joined in February by Sardar Ashja whoW just been dismissed from the Governor Generalship of Ispahan. This i^y 1 dual, although holding no official position, constituted himself supreme c e and directed the policy of the acting Khans until his recall to Tehran in W esides his intrigues with the Haji Ilkhani adherents of the Bahmai Kugl^ 1 which rendered it impossible for Amir Muiabid to establish himself at Behheban, qiq is no doubt that he was the moving spirit in the events which culmi 11 ^ ec m e forcible expulsion of the Sheikh's representative from Shush tar. ii 10 f tlie /^P arture Sardar Ashja for Tehran the Amir Mujahid, disappointed by his failure to establish himself in Behhehan, ^ onprop i-h Cai ?W a S a i^ ls t the senior Khans the sole object of which w em into appointing him to a lucrative governorship in Persia. youna« ma ^ er - The Amir had no difficulty in persuading they were bein § hardly used by their senior comrades.FOB THE YEAR 1912. 77 pointed out that, while the senior Khans were busily engaged in enriching them selves at the expense of the State all oyer Persia, the interests of himself and the younger generation had been totally neglected and they had been afforded no opportunity of taking their part in the general robbery ; they had even been charged with the unremunerative duty of tribal administration thus setting free their senior relatives. Having, with these arguments, got the younger Khans on his side the Amir next approached the tribesmen. Little argument was needed with them. Realizing that the chiefs were divided among themselves they took the law into their own hands and anarchy soon prevailed throughout Bakhtiari territory. Having thus succeeded in stirring up the country, the Amir sent a deputa- tion composed of Sardar Patheh, Munazzam-ul-Mulk and other junior Khans to Ispahan to discuss terms with the senior Khans in Tehran by telegraph. The senior Khans were already alarmed at the news they had received of the state of anairs m their country and feared that the tribes, once thoroughly out of hand, they would have difficulty in re-asserting their old authority. They were at the same time being pressed through His Majesty's Legation to restore security for ntisii trade on the Bakhtiari road which had been closed to traffic since the ascent of the II in June. They therefore bestirred themselves, dismissed the ac mg Hkhani and Ilbegi and appointed Sardar-i-Jang, a man of exceptional energy and ability, supreme Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris and in addition Governor oi Behbehan and the Kuhgelu, for a period of five years. He was armed with considerable powers and specially empowered to deal with the young Khan party as he thought fit. Tomans 45,000 were placed at his disposal which the Jllians had borrowed from the Imperial Bank of Persia. In the beginning of August Sardar-i-Jang reached Ispahan from Tehran and was there met by representatives of the Amir Mujahid's party. These representatives informed the Sardar that they were prepared to forcibly resist ms march to Chighakhur (the summer administrative capital) unless he first came to terms with themselves. After much discussion the Sardar succeeded in ringing the Amir s representatives to a reasonable frame of mind and induced ttem to return to the Amir with letters promising that he would try as far as possible to satisfy the just aspirations of the young Khan party. Captain Grey also sent a message to the Amir explaining that he had been specially deputed o accompany the Sardar and to assist him in his mission, that the Sardar's ap- pomtment to the Bakhtiari Ilkhaniship had our support, and that any action on Part which would hamper him in the execution of his duty would incur the severe displeasure of His Majesty's Government. • a ® ar( ^ r '^. an ^ e ft Ispahan for Chahar Mahal on the 24th August accompa- mea by Captain Grey and a special escort of Indian Sowars. A few marches out ot Ispahan messages were received from Amir Mujahid to the effect that he and tne young Khans accepted the assurances of the Sardar regarding the satisfaction of their claims and that he had abandoned all thought of forcible resistance. 0 days later all the Khans assembled at Chighakhur and the grievances o e Amir s party were gone into and a settlement satisfactory to all parties was armed at. The Amir himself was induced to again accept the Governor- sliip ot Behbehan, it being arranged that in the spring he should be relieved mere by a younger Khan and proceed to Yezd as Governor. Of the Junior Khans some were despatched to Yezd, others to Tehran and Ispahan and a few employed in Bakhtiari territory. All the appointments afforded opportunities or moderate mudakhil (squeeze). The rival Khans once satisfactorily disposed of, Sardar-i-Jana had no diffl- ^ the tribesmen in hand. They were by this time heartily sick ot the lawlessness which had reigned during the past four months and welcomed tne return of the Sardar whom they both like and trust. He set to work with energy to recover and return looted property, settle disputes pumsh offenders and safeguard the Bakhtiari road and, within a month, ttw k 1 ! C0U ? i 1 i y . was ; i as c l met an(1 well governed as it used to be before the Khans abandoned their role of tribal chiefs to become the dictators of Persia. This state of affairs continued until the close of the year under report.FOR THE YEAR 1912. 79 W Sons of (4) Lutf Ali Khan f (4) a) Fath Ali Khan -{ (4 b) Ab( } (4 c) Azi \J{4&gt; d) Izz Abdullah Khan Azizullah Khan Izzatullah Khan H aji I lkhani ' F amily— contcL Amir-i-Mufakham Sardar-i-Muazzam Shuja-es-Saltan (5) Gulam Husein Khan Sons of (5) f (5 d) Ali Reza Khan (5 5) Amir Mansur Khan (5 c) Abdul Husein Khan (5 d) Grhalam Reza Khan (6) Nasir Khan Sons of (6) (7) / (6 «) G-ulam Reza Khan \ (6 ^)Muzaifar Khan and one other infant son Sardar Mutesham Sardar-i-J ang Sardar AshjV Sultan Muhammad Khan Son of 7 (7 a) Abdul Reza Khan (8) Ali Akbar Khan Salar Ashraf Son of 8 (8 a) Ali Askar Khan (9) Muhammad Reza Khan Sardar Fatheh Sons of the late Beza Kuli Khan.

Relations with Shaikh of Mohammerah. —In August 1911 the Shaikh of Mohammerah received orders from the Central Government to put down disturbances which had broken out in Shushtar. He despatched for this purpose a force of Arabs under his nephew Shaikh Handzal. This chief, after quelling the disturbances, remained on in Shushtar with a small Arab force performing the duties of local Governor. He was later relieved by Mullah Abd- es-Saiyid. In March of the year under report Shaikh Khazal received orders from the Prime Minister (Samsam-es-Sultaneh, Bakhtiari) to withdraw Abd-es-Saiyid from Shushtar. The Shaikh did not obey these orders as he had information that the Bakhtiaris intended to appoint their own representatives to the Shushtar Governorship and feared that they would commence intriguing with the Arab tribes under his control. He signified his willingness to withdraw if a neutral Governor was appointed to the Governor Generalship of Arabistan with head-80 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT quarters at Shushtar. Such a Governor had been nominated in the „ Ijlal-es-Sultaneh and his assistant Vakar-ul-Mulk was at the time on his Shushtar. The Bakhtiari Khans several times repeated their demand to the „ Jai that he should withdraw from Shushtar threatening to turn his representative out by force if he did not comply. The Shaikh paid no attention to these orders and, in April, chiefs with a considerable following entered Shushtar. The Shaikh's representative and his small Arab following fled. In May the Khans in Tehran, under pressure from His Majesty's ordered the acting chiefs to withdraw from Shushtar. This was done, a force of Bakhtiari sowars under a certain Ali Nakki Khan being left to support Vakar-ul-Mulk who had by that time arrived in Shushtar. The Shaikh shortly afterwards despatched a large Arab army to Shushtar and Ali Nakki Khan and his following evacuated the town. The acting chiefs shortly afterwards left for the high country and in their absence the Shaikh's Arabs raided Bakhtiaii property in Aqili and the Dizful district causing damage variously estimated at from Tomans 3,000 to 100,000. Shortly afterwards Ijlal-es-Sultaneh reacW Shushtar and took over the Governor Generalship of Arabistan. During the summer the Bakhtiari Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani families jointly purchased half of the Jarrahi lands from Mushir-ed-Dowleh for Tomans 15,000. This was done with the avowed object of re-selling to the Shaikh anil making a profit on the transaction ; the Khans realizing that the control of the lands was vital to the Shaikh. Sardar-i-Jang reached the low country in December and, up to the the year, no arrangement had been come to as to the sum for which the JarraM lands would be sold to the Shaikh or the amount of compensation to be paid by the latter for the Aqili raid. The Shaikh-Haji Ilkhani friendship received a severe blow in the spring from the events in Shushtar which were engineered by Sardar Ashja' and tlie subsequent Arab raid on the Sardar-i-Muhtesham's property at Aqili. The Shaikh established friendly relations with Amir Mujahid during tk year and hoped through him to get the Ilkhani faction on his side. The otk Ilkhani Khans however shewed no desire for such a rapprochement. Kuhgelu —The Kuhgelu tribes have, like most of the nomadic tribes of Persia, ceased to regard themselves as subject to any control on the part of fche^ Central Government. They have ceased also to have any respect for their western neighbours, the Bakhtiaris. Formerly it was sufficient for a Bakhtiari ruling chief to establish himself near the Kuhgelu frontier with a small following, summon the headmen of tk Kuhgelu tribes, take hostages from them for the good behaviour of their tribes- men and thus ensure the safety of the Bakhtiari road and Bakhtiari villages adjoining Kuhgelu territory. This simple and inexpensive mode of procedure has now ceased tok efficacious, and the Bakhtiari Khans are faced with the alternative of eitto subduing the Kuhgelus by force of arms or leaving matters as they are an ir Z territor y i 11 the low country and the Bakhtiari road at the mercy throughout the summer when their own tribesmen are in ^ north. • , : P. unn | the year under report the Bakhtiari Khans, though professing'J® mtenfaou of suhduing the Kuhgelus by force, did not attempt to do so, and ti® nominee to the Behbehan Governorship succeeded only with some difficulty 11 entering and maintaining himself in his capital. o ril ''. s J ere not slowto take full advantage of the cbaotj S ^-Western Persia and with impunity raided Bakh* and the Ispahan and Fms districts as opportunity oiferek a vhtiari B,oad was open at the commencement of the year Condition of Reads. to the presence of the Bakhtiari -k , '*'' lowFOR THE YEAR 1912. 81 # Towards the end of April it became evident that there was no chance of Amir Mujahid establishing any sort of control over the Kuhgelu chiefs, and the only conrse left open to the Khans to ensure the safety of the road was to post sufficient guards on the road itself and the Kuhgelu passes as to render it impossible for Kuhgelu raiding parties to cross the Bakhtiari frontier. Needless to say that such a course, involving as it did considerable expense, found no favour with the chiefs and no action of any sort was taken to safeguard traffic. In the early part of June, when the Bakhtiari tribesmen had left for the high country and the Kuhgelu passes were open, the first raiding party reached the road and carried off a caravan of over 60 mules. Other raiding parties from the Dushman Ziari, Tebi and Bahmai sections, numbering in all over 1,000 men, poured into Bakhtiari territory plundering caravans, attacking Bakhtiari villages and carrying off merchandise stored at the various stages. Traffic had completely ceased by the end of June. One of the first acts of Sardar-i-Jang on his arrival in Chighakhor was to re-open the road. For this purpose he despatched 200 guards chosen from the best armed Bakhtiari tribesmen under a young chief, Bahadur-es-Sultaneh, to picket the dangerous section of the road from Shalil to Malamir. The guarding of the section from Malamir to the Arabistan border was entrusted to 0 Khuda Karim Khan, chief of the Chahar Lang. On the 18th September the Ilkhani announced officially the opening of the road and traffic was at once resumed and was still in full swing at the close of the year. In October, Lieutenant Bullock, who was travelling to Ispahan by the Bakhtiari road, was attacked and robbed between Sarkhum and Dopulun by a band of about 30 Kuhgelu brigands. His Indian orderly was wounded and died later at Ispahan. The section of the road where this outrage occurred was considered beyond the range of Kuhgelu raiders and the Ilkhani had therefore not considered it necessary to guard it. The section of the road was picket ted immediately after the incident and no further robberies occurred. The losses of British owned goods on the road through robberies amounted to £ 1,430. The following table shows the goods forwarded over the road and the number of animals employed during the year under report as compared with the two preceding years. Description. 1910. 1911. 1912.

The work at the fields has throughout the year been well ahead of tk requirements of the refinery. Excellent discipline has been maintained at the fields and there have been no disorders to record either among the European or native staffs. The attitude of the Bakhtiari Khans and tribesmen towards the has been most satisfactory during the year, no friction of any sort being enced.

Maskat now boasts of electric lights. There was another proposal to light the towns of Maskat and Muttra but in this Mr. Baiyanker did not succeed, as the necessary funds were not forth coming. On the 11th August, Joakah bint Twaini bin Said, an influential and an elderly member of the Sultan's family, died. The Political Agent wrote a letter of condolence to His Highness which was suitably acknowledged. Owing to this event. His Highness did not celebrate the Eamazan Id festival as usual. Shaikh Suleiman bin Abdur Hahim, the Ba!uch Jamadar of the fort Jelali, died on the 2nd of May. On the 2nd of January, Saiyid Taimur, who had been to Bombay to wit ness the reception of Their Imperial Majesties, returned to Maskat and im mediately visited his father at Sib, returning to Maskat on the 6th. In May, he made a short tour in the interior of Oman and, again in August, he spent a fortnight on the Batina coast. Saiyid Nadir visited Sur in 'Noor ul Bahr' in May. On the 19th December he left again for Semail and remained in the interior till the close of the year. The event of the year in Maskat tribal history was the murder, in the Condition of the country. month of March, of Said bin Ibrahim, ruler of Eostak, by his cousins. Ibrahim and Muhammad, who were immediately afterwards killed by the soldiers of the Sultan. Eostak has always been a thorn in the side of the ruler of Oman, but it does not appear that his influence has advanced there appreciably, as Ahmed, the younger brother of Said bin Ibrahim, is ruling there undisturbed. Shaikh Buti bin Suhail, the late Shaikh of Debai, visited His Highness the Sultan of Maskat in the month of March and stayed there some 10 days. Early in May, there _ were troubles between the Hawasineh, headed by Shaikhs Nasir and Saif bani Hamad and the Bani Oomar, as a result of which the Hawasineh Shaikhs commandeered three boxes of ammunition which he forced British subjects, Khojas of Khabura, to buy. The Khoias were however subsequently honestly repaid and the troubles subsided. . humours have been constantly flying about Maskat to the effect that a umy ersal ^ rising of the Bedouins of the interior will take place as a protest against His Highness' arrangements for regulating the arms traffic. His High ness has also received many threatening letters, notably from Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, A1 Harathi, the 'stormy petrel' of Oman politics, but nothing else has come of all these manifestations, and it does not seem that tribal politics this year have been more disturbed than usual. The regulation of the arms traffic snQiud indeed, if successful and wisely used, go a long way towards restoring the ouitan s authority over the unruly tribesmen of the interior. Arms Traffic. Tllis Problem has again absorbed the energies of the Agency staff to the exclu sion of more profitable occupation. The usual returns accompany this report. - d %ures for the steamer trade of 1912 are:—in German bottoms. Es.20,69,050; in British, Es. 12,94,435; total Es. 33,64,485 as against a total ot iis. 14,63,130 last year. ^ A slight portion of this increase can be accounted for by a rise in the price of rifles and ammunition towards the closing half of the year. ^ The rise in imports has been shared equally between British and German snipping. Another reason to account for the increased imports was that, from the beginning of the year, the arms traffic fraternity were well aware that the Bntish authorities, in close communication with His Highness the Sultan were plotting against their peace and profit and, on the 11th June, these negotiations resulted m the issue of a proclamation by His Highness, establishino- the Arms warehouse and setting forth rules and regulations to govern the fmport and export of these dangerous goods. The date fixed for the enforcement of the86 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT above notification was the 1st of September 1912, and the arms dealers naturally endeavoured to avail themselves to the utmost of the periorl nf that still remained to them. 01 » Eor the moment, the success of these measures is shown by the fact tl since the close of October, imports into Maskat have ceased entirely, while t?' returns for September and October are very materially less than those for? preceding seven months of the year. The arms traders, and especially fi ^ French, are reaping a temporary enormous profit by the surreptitious sale of rifles and ammunition, in defiance of the rules and regulations, at double [\ usual prices but stocks are running low and must be exhausted before lop unless the negotiations, proceeding in Europe, anent the legality of tJe proclamations and the rules made thereunder, turn in favour of the Frencli pretensions. The warehouse was duly established on the first of September. A superin. tendent from India, Saiyid Kasim bin Saiyid Imam Kadri, with a previous excellent record in Government service under the East Africa Protectorate was appointed thereto by His Highness the Sultan with the approval of the GoTern- ment of India. Saiyid Kasim has a difficult task to carry out and has siowii marked ability, zeal and discretion therein. The buildings, appropriated to tk ends of the warehouse, are conveniently situated close to the Customs House, accommodation is adequate and records and accounts are in good order. At present, the local Oman market is so glutted with arms that there is little opportunity for legitimate sale but, as the situation clears and the question ol Erench acquiescence in the rules and regulations relating to the arms trade adjusts itself, there seems no reason why the warehouse should not pay its way. The opposition of the local tribesmen, already alluded to in this report, does not seem serious. It may be interesting to note here, as a sign of the commencement of» fidence in Saiyid Kasim on the part of His Highness the Sultan that the latter has permitted Saiyid Kasim to work, at small cost, some experimental lime kilns near Maskat. Saiyid Kasim believes that he will be able considerably to increase and cheapen the local supply and eventually, perhaps, to send lime to Karachi. The quarantine arrangements, under the supervision of the Agency Public Health, Hospital and Quarantine. Surgeon, have WOl 'ked Well during i year. The public health has been good and, with the exception of a solitarj P^ Case ' ailc ^ ^ r0m one of the British India ships, which fortunately got well, there were no epidemic diseases either in Maskat or Muttra during the year.

His Highness approached the Political Agent with a view to collecting ma'asharat (export duty) from British subjects in the Batinah ports. The question was placed before the leading British Indian merchants who objected to the proposal on the grounds that His Highness' authority in those parts was so weak that the result of any such orders would be that British merchants would pay the ma'asharat, whereas Arab merchants, in those parts usually Bedouin Shaikhs, would escape. They therefore thought that, in the Batinah ports, the ma'asharat should be levied from the cultivators, who would be able to collect from merchants by charging a higher price for their goods.

The past year has been politically uneventful as far as the mutual relations of the Truoial Chiefs a ad the affairs of the hinterland are concerned; no serious dissensions occurred among the Chiefs of the maritime tribes, whilst their relations with the Bedouin were generally satisfactory. The ruling Chiefs of Abu Dhabi and Debai, Shaikhs Tahnun bin Zaid and ButtLbin Soheil, were gathered to their fathers during the year, but though, in both cases, it at first seemed possible that the succession would be disputed, in the event the question, was amicably adjusted and the Government of India were asked in due course to accord their recognition to the new incumbents. The details of succession are given below in the sections relating to these Principalities. The Arms Traffic, however, continued to be a stone of stumbling for many of the Chiefs, who, partly from apathy and partly from a not entirely unreason able apprehension of incurring the hostility of the tribes in the hinterland, have been slow to take rigorous measures to prevent their coast and even their towns from being used as jumping off places by the arms smugglers. Shaikh Salim bin Sultan has continued in the Shaikhdom, but it has not Ras-ai-Khaimah. beei1 considered advisable to accord speci fic recognition to his independent status, at all events until we have disposed of the Abu Musa case into which his achievement of a status, as Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, independent of the Shaikh of Shargah, might conceivably introduce a complication. Shaikh Rashid's behaviour has been satisfactory, but his action in Umm -ei -Kowein. expelling from the Town his half brother, Nasir, and the latter's mother, on suspicion of being connected with an alleged attempt against his own life, is likely to prove a source of trouble tq the Residency, if a reconciliation cannot be effected. At the time of the Resident's return to the Gulf from India, Ajmau. In February, a controversy which tjirea- tened to become acute was raging between the Chiefs of Ajman and Debai in regard to various outstanding claims and in particular with reference to the Bin Luta family (vide pa^e 78 Chapter IX, Administration Report, 1910). Shaikh Humaid's Principality frequently figures in the reports of Arms Traffic informers and the repeated remonstrances which have been addressed to him in common with other Trucial Chiefs on the subject have not had as much practical effect as could be desired, though like his fellows, Shaikh Humaid strenuously protests his readiness to act in accordance with the wishes of Government and denies the truth of reports communicated to him regarding exit of caravan consignments through his coastal limits. Relations with Shaikh Sargar have been satisfactory except Sha , in connection with the Arms Traffic in ' . ■ f which his apathy and unwillingness to take any action which might bring him into collision with his people or his neighbours, have made him difficult to deal with. This question was brought to a head in September when Isa bin Abdul Latif, son of the Residency Agent having specifically asked for and been refused assistance by the Shaikh, with the aid of a few volunteers from among his own friends, effected the capture of a consignment of some 875 rifles and 60 boxes of cartridges, despatched by caravan trom Maskat en route to the Ghandhah creek, some 40 miles beyond Debai which had been dumped and delayed at a place short of its destination called90 PERSIAN GfLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Thowaimah near Shargah, owing to the refusal of the Bedouin proceed farther, and the consequent necessity of obtaining fresh transport arms were in due course handed over to one of His Majesty's ships wvl proceeded to Shargah for the purpose; three Nejdi Arabs who were along with the arms were, under authority of the Government of India genit Karachi for imprisonment by the Civil authorities. ' Ho Isa bin Abdul Latif's courageous and loyal conduct was suitably reward d by the gift of a fine telescope appropriately inscribed. Subsequent to the seizure of this consignment, the Eesidency Agent had been absent at Eas-al-Khaimah, wrote to complain that Shaikh Sa^ar J neglected to take proper precautions to safegard Isa Abdul Latif from molestation or worse at the hands of Arab strangers, who, it was represented had designs on the latter's life; Shaikh Sagar was warned by the First Assistant (who had been deputed in another connection to the coast in B I M. S. ^Lawrence') that if any more was heard on this subject, le Eesident would advise the Government of India to give Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif a sepoy guard; no further development, however, occurred and was allowed to drop. Towards the end of the year, after reference to the Government the Shaikhs of Shargah, Debai and Ajman, whom reports indicated tobe .... principal delinquents in Arms Traffic matters, mainly because they occupy tie centre of the Coast, were informed that unless they exerted themselves more seriously and effectively forthwith to stop the use of their territories by an traffickers, Government would be obliged without further warning to impose heavy fines on them for their neglect, or even to take measures on land to eradicate the illicit trade. To Shaikh Sagar was added an expression of Government's strong disappro val and surprise at his entire failure to co-operate in the seizure oi arms at Thowaimah above referred to, and he was warned of his personal res- ponsibility, in case he failed to accept the Resident's advice, to fine and expel certain specified individuals, subjects of his, who were reported by the Resi dency Agent to be trading in arms. The Shaikh of Hamriyah was formerly considered to be a dependent of Hamriyah. theJawasim Shaikh of Shargali but lie broke away from the latter Principalitj in lb75 and has been rather in the position of a 'nobody's bairn' ew since, whilst the Shaikh of Shargah has been so notoriously apathetic an! weak m dealing with all his allies and adherents, that it is not a matter or suprise that he should have alienated, in turn, the affections of his nominal vassals, the ^ Shaikhs of Pujairah, Khor Fakkan and Hamriyah; the W named district, being next door to Zora on the east, it seems probable that, s ouid we instal ourselves there, it would in practice become necessary for ^ 0 ^ Shaikh of Hamriyah direct; the Government of Twr* ^ e ™ ore &gt; asked to give the Resident discretion to inform ShaiB c ur Ranim that, as a matter of convenience, connected with our presence at Zora, it was proposed in future to deal with him direct, and that if jf r ^ us ^ e( J. the Resident would be prepared to recommend Jie rnmen of India, after a time, to recognise him as an independent Slrf Tahnun bin Said, the ruling Chief, died in October 1912 after a ^ Abu Dhabi. of 2 years, and was succeeded J had bppn o « j ^ brother, Hamdan bin 2aia * had the 11 qp a* i?- i a • res P® c t e( i Shaikh but a chronic invalid, not havin? sitting or lying postura' 106 ^ aCCessio11 aild tllus having to spend his W 611 dealinss^ftWhn 1 ? ,a l 11 , ulrl an d his successor have been tractable in recover from fhp 'U esi ? e ^ c y» arL( i have exerted themselves in the endear commuted on a their influence compensation forap^ lias made it all fhp Their satisfactory attitude in this r®?. the ^ ^ difficult to fence with their frequent import) urse themselves from the Persian Government direct, 224 FFOR THE YEAR 1912. 97 it is hoped that something in that direction will be feasible in order to wipe off this long outstanding case.

The result of this and of the absence of other distractions in the form of epidemics, is shown by an increase in attendance during 1912 as compared with 1911, though the figures of attendance for 1910 have not been reached. The actual figures are given below :— Year. In-door. Out-door.

Lieutenant Townshend, EE., of the Public Works Department, inspected the Agency building in June, and his report on its condition was highly unfavourable. In these circumstances it was useless to elaborate plans for the 2nd and 3rd items above, and the Politi cal Eesident referred the question of whether the Agency should be entirely rebuilt on the same or a different site, or merely be subjected to extensive repairs for the decision of the Government of India. The question is still under consideration, as the Government of India have called for plans and estimates for the new Agency and subsidiary buildings before giving their decision. In the meantime, a considerable plot of land contiguous with the Agency ground on the west has been given to the Agency by Shaikh Isa. This will suffice for any new buildings which may eventually have to be erected. The detachment of the 7th Eajputs was relieved by one of the 2nd Eajputs on 11th November 1912, and left for Bombay on 25th November 1912. Shaikh Isa bin Ali enjoyed good health throughout the year, and so did his sons. Shaikh Hamad, the eldest, made his usual shooting trip to Lingah in the autumn. Shaikh Muhammad, the third son, made the pilgrimage to Mecca overland returning to Bahrain on the 28th December 1912 after an absence of three months. Shaikh Muhammad was most hospitably received by the Sharif of Mecca, and by other local potentates en route. He appears to have enjoyed the trip on the whole. ^Sepoy Guard. Shaikh and Family. It will be remembered that Shaikh Isa and his Relations. Khalifah bin Hamad bin Muhammad A1 Khalifah, a disloyal relation of Shaikh Isa, left Bahrain in September 1911 and made his way to Constantinople to lodge complaints against the Shaikh of having appropriated his and his father's property. In. the present year he returned to Basrah, and it is understood that the Wali of Basrah, Hasan Eeza, was instructed to interest himself in his case. The Wali showed his interest by addressing a series of impertinent letters to Shaikh Isa calling on him to accord fair treatment to his oppressed relations. The first letter, which was dated 13th April 1912, and subsequent ones, dated 20th May and 20th June 1912, were shown by Shaikh Isa to the Political Agent. The latter strongly advised the Shaikh to take no notice of them, but Shaikh Isa insisted that his dignity would suffer if answers were not sent by himself, and he accordingly made non-committal replies which he showed to the Political Agent. The Political Agent kept the Eesidency informed, and Shaikh Isa's letters were written against the express advice of the Political Eesident. The Shaikh100 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT contended that the correspondence was friendly and personal, and as such mitted to him by the Treaty of 1892. i ' Finally, in August the Wali sent a letter by hand and requested SliaiH Isato discuss the matter with the bearer, Abdur Eahim Basri, ContractorS the Hasa-Nejd Turkish Post. Shaikh Isa declined any such discussion, but too fright at his own temerity and spoke to the Political Agent in some agitation of the probability of a Turkish man-of-war being sent to Bahrain. Captain Lorimer did what he could to raise his spirits while pointing the moral, ^ it required a letter from the Eesidency to allay his perturbation, Reference was made to the Government of India, and on instructions received from it the Political Agent conveyed a verbal warning to Shaikh Isa couched in the following terms ;— ' The Government of India instruct Captain Lorimer to warn Shaikh Isa bin All A| Khalifah of the impropriety of his conduct in sending replies to the letters of the Wali of Basrah as he did in the case of Shaikh Khalifah bin Hamad _ A1 Khalifah, and similarly * 1st Article:—That 1 will on no account enter strictly to forbid him from violating his Agree- into any agreement or correspondence with any other ment * with the High British Government of than the British Government. 1892 (14th Shaban 1309) by any further correspon dence with the Wali/'' A written copy was subsequently handed to the Shaikh that he might not be able to assert his ignorance of its terms in case of a reference to it in tlie fut Lire. Shaikh Isa did not have any difficulties with any of his other relations during the year. Prior to the affairs of Khalifah bin Hamad, the same Wali had in Maict oi -i i t ^ ^ w v ^ t? i. addressed two letters to Shaikh Isa asking Shaikh Isa and the Wall of Basrah. i • j , , , , _ . , ^ mm to arrest and send to Basrah undei escort certain deserters from the Turkish Army who were said to have to Bahrain. Shaikh Isa, as in the other case, insisted in writing himself to say rightly or wrongly that the men could not be found in Bahrain. The corres pondence had no further sequel. Babrain Subjects Abroad. „ , The status Of Bahrain Or SOlfaj Bahrain subjects m Mohammeran did not come up during the present year. On the other hand, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul at Lingah wrote,oa 5th May 1912, that many of Shaikh Isa's subjects were coming to Lingah witli a out passports issued by the Shaikh and countersigned by the Political Agent M provided with ' Tazkarahs ' signed by the Bahrain Persian merchant Haji Abdun Nabi Kal Ewaz. Further particulars were asked for but were not forthcoming. Shaikh Isa was approached on the subject and promised, as01 previous occasions, to try and induce his subjects to take out proper passports. _ man, Abdun Nabi referred to above, is known to be in the habit of issuing ' Tazkarahs ' in this way to Persians in Bahrain as though they resident in Persian territory, but it has not as yet been found convenient to take action against him, pending the introduction of the projected Order m (jouncil for Bahrain.

Aatin '' jj'fp 8 at time were m sucb a state of confusion, complaints by all classes of the community so rife and Ahmed Yatim himself so anxious to be rid ) 4^ of the business, that Shaikh Isa decided to replace him. Various candidates were brought before the^ Shaikh by various interested parties. Hearing this the Political Agent reminded the Shaikh that he should only make a new ^ ^ appointment after discussion and agreement with the Agency. Shaikh Isa replied that he had already appointed Abdul Karim Khadim (Persian) who appeared to him to be a very suitable man for the post The Political Agent expostulated but without effect, and finally lodged a' formal objection refusing to accord approval on behalf of Government. ., The Shaikh maintained his ground and the appointment duly took effect- Abdul Karim, a mean and lying low class Persian, had already during a lono- tenure of office (in 1907-10) proved his incompetence and objectionableness, and ms re-appomtment now for a year was generally unpopular. He &lt;?ave the ordinary undertaking to the Shaikh, but the sum to be paid for the privileo-e ot lanamg cargo was raised from Es. 14,400 to Es. 18,000. a This has made Abdul Karim extremely grasping, and has led to manv complaints ^ against his exactions, which, though contrary to precedent were in some cases in accordance with the letter of the law. Strong objection to his irregular action was expressed to the Shaikh bv the Pontical Resident on his visit in June, and the whole unsatisfactory state of the Landing Management was discussed at length, but resulted onlv in the customary vague and futile promises of improvement by Shaikh Isa. He was given a month in which to talk matters over with the Political Agent and evolve some new system, preferably including the appointment of some responsible outside persons satisfactory to us, to supervise the Department Failing the production of some such scheme, the whole question would be referred to Government. Shaikh Isa resolutely declined to discuss the matter, and in due course, m August, the Political Eesident addresed the Government of India on the subject in a long despatch (No. 1956, dated 25th August 1912), review ing the past history and present position of the affair. In December orders were received from the Government of India to call upon the Shaikh to frame and submit a suitable scheme within a specified time. At the end of the year the Shaikh stated that he was giving the matter ms consideration. 0 mm tone' .On the removal of Ahmed Yatim, a large number of claims were lodged Til « fffiIT c a r go lost, not dehvered, or damaged.

It expressed itself unable to an opinion m regard to nee damaged by rain which pecuniarily constituted the ■Aiii*'* i the claims. This was not to be wondered at as Shaikh Isa had n ■!W alway ? re P ud iated all responsibility on the part of the Department for losses so caused. In all the other claims, however, the Landing Agent either admitted hk Ga» J. : liability, or his liability was asserted by the Court admitted his isfacW!' _ A considerable number of these claims were then, or have since been met in most cases by the production of goods, showing that the Defendant had bTen ags&amp;s 't a 1 sx' ,a8,1 ' ,m 10 • '■ oi rtich102 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT It is hoped that it may be possible to deal in a similar way with more cases against the new Contractor, whose administration has been little if at aj more successful than his predecessor s. Difficulty was at first experienced i n findins Arab members to sit on the Court, but m November a Speci; was formed which met several times during December and settled a — claims. The old question of raising the landing rates was kept well to the forefo the Shaikh and interested parties during the year. The claim principally BretJ was thit of the donkeymen for which there is probably some slight jastificatioj in fact It was finally decided to accept the raising of the rates, pending the result of the recent reference to Government on the whole landing question fe. coming known. The war in Tripoli continued to engage the attention of the Arabs and they displayed much interest in the terms of the interest in the Turco-itaiianwar. settlement. Early in the year a subscrip. tion list for the Eed Crescent Society and for the helping of the distressed Muslim soldiers in Tripoli was opened and money was personally collected by Haji Mukbil -ud-Dukair and Yusuf Kanoo. About II?, 28,000 was supposed to have been promised, and it is known that Us. 20,000 was actually remitted to Basrah for transmission to Tripoli via Egypt. The reluctance to forward the money through Constantinople was very marked. Towards the end of the year, the Turco-Balkan War naturally excited a ffood deal of interest. Owing to the all- Interest in the Turco-Balian War. sCnCC of the telegraph, and a ' mail service, news was received very late and authentic news^ was is mented by fictitious reports of Turkish victories received from bazaar rumours. The Agency endeavoured to supply correct news wlien poss ible. In November a subscription was raised for the Eed Crescent Society ani a sum of Es. 1,04,000 was collected, the Shaikh subscribing Es. 10,000 and all the well-to-do merchants and others subscribing handsomely. ^ At the end of December, Yusuf Kanoo and Shaikh Abdul Wahab Zayyani proceeded to Basrah to transmit the amount to Constantinople, taking the precaution land at Bushire and send a telegram to the Saltan giving details of the a subscribed and of the fact that it had been subscribed by the Shail inhabitants of Bahrain for the Eed Crescent Society. This was considered necessary to prevent the Wali of Basrah interfering in the matter. The Debai incident appears still to occupy a place in the foreground of . ,-vr the Arab mind, and frequent references to Arab Newspapers. ^ ^ to ^ in the Arab fe papers, etc., in circulation in Bahrain. By way of example there was a long reference to it in the Mujallat-ul-Mumr of July published in Cairo. These papers also interest themselves in Bahrain affairs. In the aria® just referred to there is a hostile reference to imaginary regulations for tM Pearl Fishery which the British Government was supposed to be going to introduce. ^ In the al-Mmir of Basrah, dated 27th September 1912, there were som? entirely fanciful remarks regarding British activities in Bahrain.

The local Arab appears to be veryFOR THE YEAR 1912. 103 ible, sometimes even against his better judgment, to the influences of personal friendship. It is to be regretted in some ways that the pre-oecupations of the Political Agent in Bahrain and the largely judicial position he holds, make it difficult for him to go out of his way to cultivate the acquaintance of the Arabs personally. It is difficult for him to see much of them except in relation to business when their interests are often at stake. The constant necessity also of guarding the interest of a large alien population, who are not popular, tends na'turally to produce some sense of opposition between the Political Agent and the Arabs. On the whole, however, the relationship existing between them is to be regarded as decidedly satisfactory. In all places circumstanced as Bahrain is, difficulty must necessarily arise Good offices to Bahrain Subjects and others. in particular cases in deciding to grant or withhold our good offices. The right to British protection is highly prized, and when once acquired every effort is made to give it a hereditary character. Thus the descendants of a Bahrain subject who has become a Naturalised British subject in India, cling to the privileges of their forebear; and those persons who have for one reason or another been made Honorary Munshis regard the protection of themselves and their offspring as the legitimate price of their services whether these are real or imaginary. The ideal position aimed at, of course, by all such individuals and families is to have a foot firmly planted in each camp and to be able to appeal to the Agency when in extremis or when their case is bad. Legally it is evident they have no standing ground, but they have public feeling on their side, and rejecting their claims we have to face a certain depreciation in public opinion. The question of protecting such persons may at any moment come to the front, and in such a case the temptation is always to carry our prerogatives to the extreme or beyond the extreme point. That is what is always expected of the Political Agent, not only by his staff but by the general public. In the case of Bahrain, our position seems sufficiently strong to warrant oti? throwing considerations of prestige in such cases to the winds and keeping within the strict limits of legality. This principle has been acted on during the year, and the 'good offices' of the Agency have on more than one occasion been refused to persons presum ing on a lapsed or defective right. After an interval of six years another regrettable intanc of punishment by Primitive Justice. mutilation has been recorded. The Political Agent approached Shaikh Isa tentatively •on the subject, but found him strongly entrenched behind the sanction of the Shara. The case was referred to Bushire, but a letter from the Political Resident suggesting that the Shaikh should undertake not to sanction such punishments in the future, received only an uncompromising non possumus answer. No necessity or excuse for barbarous punishments exists in Bahrain, and we occupy such a strong and prominent position that our moral responsibility, which is fully recognised by the public, is very great if we permit their employment to be continued. The last case of mutilation occurred in 1906. The matter was therefore referred to Government with the suggestion that Shaikh Isa should be warned that such punishments cannot be permitted in Manama, and it has been decided that a warning will be given to the Shaikh when the Bahrain Order in Council is introduced. As the result of a great friction which occurred between him and his Katr Loci Government. 0f ^ P 0siti01 l, Shaikh Abdullah bm Jasim A1 Thani re signed his governorship of Doha and has since persistently refused to resume the governorship without an explicit undertaking from the members of the tc A1 Thani' family that his orders would be obeyed. Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad A1 Thani used every effort to patch up the quarrel between his sons, but was not successful. The Wali of Basrah inter ested himself in this affair and communicated to Shaikh Jasim that the Turkish^ PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Government earnestly hoped that he would use his influence to avoid tlie (ii s ruption of the ' A1 Thani ' family. Towards the end of the year, it was reported that the people of Doha had begun to feel the strain of Shaikh Khalifah bin Jasim's rule as Governor of Doha and that they were anxious to see Shaikh Abdullah reinstated. Tliese events bode no good for the A1 Thani family for the future. As the result of the imprudent action on the part of a Yuz BasM inseiz- ing lucerne from some lucerne sellers of Hasaan ai ' Tarut, a serious quarrel occurred between the Tarut people and the local Katif authorities, which resulted in the recall to Hasa of the Yuz Bashi. Two serious skirmishes occurred during the year between the townspeople and the Bedouin :— (а) One between the Amayir Bedouin of Anik and the gardeners of Saihat in which the loss of 40 men in killed and wounded occurred; (б) and the other between the Bedouin and the people of Safwa whicli resulted in the loss of six men in killed and wounded. These incidents caused great uneasiness among the people who blamed tlie Local Government for being powerless to put down Bedouin raids, and who, as a remedy against such occurrences, suggested the posting of strong garrisons in all the outlying villages. The Ojair-Hasa Trade Eoute continued unsafe throughout the year owing „ , to the depredations of the Bedouin, tlie The Oiair-Hasa Trade Route. i • i? jv t -u • 1.1 hi- • , n chiei onenders being the Manasir tnoe, Two caravans were waylaid and looted during the year. With reference to the remarks in last year's report regarding the setttle- . men of the Al bu Ainain tribe at Kasr-us- Subaih, the intrigues of the tribe witl the Turkish authorities have resulted in the establishment of a small Turkish Post at Kasr-us-Subaih. It has however been decided that this port is not in cluded in the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Kuwait so that the question of tlie doings of the Al bu Ainain in that locality is no longer of any particular impoi- tance.

Among other property being conveyed for him were two pearls, the property of the Sultan of Maskat. A complaini was also lodged by an Indian Muhammadan barber. Eeference was made to Shaikh Isa to induce him to exercise Political influence on the mainland which he imagines he acquires through the yearly doles which he makes to representatives of the tribes. In the course of time it was reported that the bulk of the property W been recovered and handed over to the Mutassarif of Hasa. Nothing more Ms been heard and no further complaints have been made by the sufferers to tue Agency, so presumably they have been satisfied.

The number of slaves manumitted during the year was 11. ' difficulty was encountered in Manumission of Slaves and Slave Trade. an y 0 f these Cases. The case of Isa bin Ahmed, Dosiri, mentioned in last year's dragged on throughout the greater part of the year. Pressure was kept upon Shaikh Isa to bring him to book, but the Shai was afraid of the powerful Dosiri faction, and other disagreements supervened between Isa bin Ahmed and the Shaikh's son, Muhammad. At one time Isa bin Ahmed went over to Hasa and began negotiating ?i the Turkish authorities. When the Political Eesident came to Bahrain, k June, he was however at Budaiya. Shaikh Isa promised to bring him in, but he was actually permitted to make his escape to Darin. Shaikh Isa was tk required to pay up a fine of R 500 on his account, and further action was contemplated. Isa bin Ahmed then began to see good to make his peace with us, antla fairly satisfactory letter of apology was received from him. Eeferencewas made to Shaikh Isa and then direct negotiations were opened with Isai Ahmed who was required to come in to the Agency and confirm his apologj verbally. This he eventually did, in October, and the episode closed his declaring himself a devoted friend and supporter of the British Goyem- ment. Credit for the arrangement, which for the moment at least is satisfactorj, is largely due to Shaikh Abdul Latif, Dosiri, his tribe-fellow, who had Mmsei gone through a somewhat similar stage of development, and is now on verj satisfactory terms with the Agency. In August, a Somali Nakhoda Muhammad Musa (the same individual mentioned in the Euwairat Robbery Case above) entered a charge ag® another Somali, Omar bin Yusuf {alias Said), of having^ kidnapped ^ sold 3 Somali boys whom the Complainant had temporarily deposited b Oman. Omar, who was by this time on board a steamer in the h ar J* ^ arrested and placed in detention. He denied the accusation and countercharge against Muhammad Musa.

He was very obstinate, being obviously unwilling to appear in the r61e of an innovator, and was only with difficulty induced to accept a special formal assurance by the Government of India that they were going to erect stations at Kuwait and elsewhere. On this being later forthcoming he withdrew his objection, and a site on the coast f mile to the south-east of the Agency was selected by the Political Agent and approved and measured and marked out by Lieutenant Townshend, R.E., of the Public Works Department and Mr. Gumbley of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. This stage was reached in the beginning of September, and no further progress has been made locally except that the above-mentioned piece of ground measuring 700' X 600' was formally given to the Agency by Shaikh Isa in December. It is hardly necessary to touch on this subject, which has been dealt with p ., at length in the Trade Eeport for 1911-12. Commercial. T-t • • x x ,f , . . It is sumcient to say that, owing to a succession of good pearling seasons, trade is booming in Bahrain, and British Shipping Companies and merchants are more than holding their own. At the end of the year a second European was appointed to the firm of Gray Paul &amp; Co. as assistant. At the end of the year information was received that the weekly mail » «i. . j &lt;*• mi vr • l- n service was to be reintroduced from the British India Steam Navigation Company. beginning of next year. This will be a great improvement.

'Palinurus' arrived here on 8th October 1912, for surveying the vicinity of the Turkish Coast and the northern approaches to Bahrain, and was still in these waters at the end of the year. At the instance of the Mutassarif of Hasa, Abdur Eahim, the Basrah- „ r, ^ ' Hasa Postal Contractor was sent to Baarab-ei-Hasa Post. Bahrain in April by the Wali of Basrah to make better arrangements for a rapid mail service, and to proceed to Hasa to remove all irregularities in the Postal Service reported by the Mutassarif. Abdur Eahim did not, however, go to Hasa on the plea that the route was unsafe, and complained to the Wali that unless the Government took measures to suppress the Bedouin raids on the Ojair-Hasa route, it would not be possible to establish any regular service between Basrah and Hasa. During his stay in Bahrain he got a larger mail boat built. Abdur Eahim receives Es. 310 per mensem for the Basrah-Hasa Contract, and the Forwarding Agent in Bahrain, Mulla Abdur Eahim, is paid T£3 a month. The service between Bahrain and Ojair and Bahrain and Katif is weekly, and between Basrah and Bahrain sometimes weekly and at others fortnightly. The mails are sent in bags as personal luggage by the British India, Arab and other steamers. The state of business of the branch of the firm of Eobert 'Wonckhaus and ^ ^ ^ Company at Bahrain is much the same as e erman inn. described in last year's report. The firm has filed a large number of suits in the Agency Court to recover debts on shell transactions. This institution pursued the even tenour of its way, and had no difficulties with the local authorities or the people mencan ission. during the year. Dr. S. M.

At present there are no regular proteges of the above Powers in Bahrain. The Pearling Season in Bahrain having been a good one and the place consequently prosperous, the number of claims and suits filed in the was low. The number of cases between Nakhodas and divers was small, Kakhodas could afford to be comparatively liberal to their men. The remarks made by Captain Lorimer in last year's report regarding tlie inefficiency of the arrangements for dealing with cases apply with eq 1 ' this year. The Amir of Manama continues to be as incompetent and as ever, and the Shaikh will not remove him or even appoint a more man as a deputy or assistant. The whole judicial arrangements are highly unsatisfactory, and the Politi cal Agent in his judicial capacity is always in the position of having: to make bricks without straw. The difficulty of summoning parties, witnesses, etc., is very great, and it is often very irksome to find oneself responsible for adminis tering justice in such a haphazard way as it has to be administered here, owing to the fact that the Agency has no executive staff of its own and has to worl through the local authorities. However, foreigners are only too anxious to make use of the Agency, and, such as it is, the Court is no doubt most efficient in the Islands, which is some consolation. During the year Muhammad bin Padhal was appointed Salifah Judge and lie has decided cases between N akhodas and divers promptly and well. Un- fortunately he was dissatisfied (naturally) at not getting any pay, and may resign at any time. The Political Agent mentioned the matter several times to Shaikh Isa, and at the end of the year a trifling salary was granted to tlif Salifah Judge; whether he will be satisfied with it or not remains to Itf seeA. The Chief Kazi, Jasim bin Mahza, dealt with most of the cases referred to him in a satisfactory manner. As mentioned above a Special Majlis has been arranged to deal with clam 15 against the Landing Contractor. The Majlis-ul-i-Urfi cannot dispose of cases quickly as it only meets once a week ; some of the administration cases mentioned in the last Report $ been settled, but such cases are bound to dra* on for a very long time under existing conditions. to this report^ ^ CaSeS dealt by ^ Agenc ^ durin S the ^ iS The following is a summary of the weather report for 1912 kindly. by Dr. H.

The jear under review has been a remarkably prosperous one for Kuwait The chief reasons for this fortunate Gencra1 ' state are the comparative peace of tlie desert routes which permitted the free transit of caravans, the good condi tion of the cattle in the desert, which allowed the realization of prices for them as well as for other desert produce, and the favourable pearl season which, following as,it did on two previous good years, has made money plentiful and cheap in the town and so enriched the sea-faring folk that their extravagance now bids fair to make Kuwait a rival to Bahrain in its, notoriety for the high cost of wages and living. Although the growth in trade, the rise in the prices of practically all com modities, and the exceedingly high wages now demanded by all crafts brings about temporarily an atmosphere of great affluence, a reaction seems bound to follow on the ' slightest depression in trade or the pearl-market for the poorer classes are thriftless to a degree; indeed a man who can easily earn as much as Rs. 5 a day is, as often as not, heavily in debt. No one seems to contemplate the possibility of a lean year, nor to consider the desirability of making some provision and when it does come, I fear the distress in the town will be severe. The highest maximum temperature recorded during the year was 115° for the 10th June and, excepting a few days Climate and Rainfall. m the beginning of that ^ month, whicli were rather trying owing to the prevalence of southerly winds, the sum mer on the whole was not very severe, though not as mild as that of the previous year. The winter also was much milder, the minimum recorded temperature being 36° as compared with 2^ 7° of the previous year. The total rainfall registered at the Agency Observatory amoiuted to only 2 inches 66i cents, which is less than half the average (the average of the past three years is inches 39 cents). The rainfall sufficed at the beginning of the year to provide fair grazing and fodder, but the absence of rain in November and December is causing anxiety ; and there will be scarcity and impoverisfl- ment of the livestock in the desert in the ensuing year, unless copious rain falls early in January 1913. An extract prepared from the Agency daily meteorological reports is attached as Appendix I. On lith January a sensation was caused by the arrest of ^ one Local affairs. bil1 Ghanim and some of Ws fo Ug on a charge of conspiracy against bna Mubarak's life.

The incident took place on the highway by the Shaikh's palace and on representations being made by the Political Agent to Shaikh Mubarak, on his return from Mohammerah, energetic steps were at once taken by the latter and such of the offenders as were then discoverable were suitably punished; some of the articles robbed were recovered and returned togethefr with the value of the missing ones. Prom the general talk in the town it was evident that Shaikh Mubarak's action in the matter had a most salutary effect in emphasizing the fact that he would not countenance an assault on a British prot^g^ whether committed by townspeople or men of his own following. The Kuwait 'Madrasseh' referred to in last year's report has now 0 , , come into being, but the fact falls far Kuwait School. i j i» ai •? i • • n t short of the ideal originally proposed. One Saiyid Muhammad Eashid, the proprietor of the Egyptian religious periodical ' Al-Minar,' visited Kuwait'in May, and it was intended by some of the subscribers to the institution that he should supervise the selection of teachers. Local opinion became divided, however, and the result has been that the ' Madrasseh ' is now no more than the ordinary Arab school, in which instruction in the Koran and the elements of reading and writing is imparted to small boys. A party still desires a proper modern education likely to be of more real benefit in after life, but the bigoted Muhammadans' idea that know ledge of the Koran is all sufficient prevents any real progress. In April plans and estimates for the building were prepared, and about October a house, with a large quadrangle and some 6 or 8 large and several smaller rooms, was finished at a cost of about Rs. 30,000 and the school was opened for the public. At present some 170 to 180 boys are on the roll and the teaching staff consists of:— the Principal, by name Yusuf bin Esa bin Husein, a local Kuwait Arab ; an expounder of the Koran and the Hedaya by name Shaikh Muhammad Naj- muddin, a British Indian subject from Lahore who receives the respectable monthly wage of £T. 17 with free quarters at the school premises ; one Saiyid Umar, a Smyrna Turk, who teaches Koran-reading and intonation and writing, on a salary of £T. 7 and two other Baghdad Arabs. The Saiyid Muhammad Rashid referred to above, accompanying Muham mad bin Salim, the Bombay Agent of Shaikh Mubarak, arrived in Kuwait on the 9th May and next day delivered a lecture attended by Shaikhs Jabir and Nasir (Shaikh Mubarak's sons) and some 1,000 Arabs of all classes. He lectured on the rites and the propagation of the Islamic faith, and in the course of it warned his hearers against foreign missionaries and others like them who endeavoured to obtain a footing in Muhammadan countries. The lecture was not actively anti-European or anti-Christian, but its tone undoubtedly indicated that foreigners should be discouraged. Though the Saiyid remained more than a month in Kuwait, his subsequent lectures were confined strictly to interpretation and elucidation of the Koran and Hadaya, possibly on a hint from Shaikh Mubarak, whose guest he was. A project for the enlargement of one of the boat harbours, which had been suggested to the Shaikh some eighteen months ago, took shape in December when work was begun on the boat-harbour from a little east of the Agency house almost up to the Shaikh's palace. The old wall has been moved seawards and about three times the former area has been made available for boats, which will now be afloat almost the whole 24 hours instead of only at high tides as was formerly the case. Owners of houses on the foreshore and boat-owners were required to subscribe towards the expenses, and some Rs. 28,000 was collected before the commencement of the work. The scheme has effected a great public improvement and is of material assistance to pearl-boat owners. It is expected that the work will cost about Rs. 35,000 to 40,000 to complete. The improvement in local currency matters, mentioned in last year's report, continues and rupees are no longer Exchange. discounted in Kuwait, whilst exchange has become steadier.

There is now a f i large supply of sovereigns in circulation, and people prefer them to Tn i l Liras as they are exchanged by the Shroffs at their full legal rate of ^ [ with sometimes a small premium. The exchange of Maria Theresa ' depends mostly on the rise and fall of the silver market-—in January it quoted at Rs. lil^ per 100 dollars and by December had risen steadily to u? rupees per cent. This rise was due largely to the considerable Bedouin and Nejdi divers leaving for their homes in Central Arabia at tlie ^ of the pearling season and requiring their gains in dollars. Although trans tions are now generally carried on in rupees, merchants prefer to quote prij for certain commodities in dollars because they obtain a profit thereby on {\ exchange. This, it appears, cannot be averted so long as dollars remain jj circulation, and Bedouins insist on payment in that currency. Camels, live- stock generally and articles bought from desert tribesmen are those usually dealt in in dollars. The postal work of the port, which is still being carried on by tlie Postal Matters Political Agent's Office, has grown to such dimensions that, |in the registration and parcel branches, there were at one time being received as many as loi to 180 ordinary and value-payable parcels in a week. Latterly, howeyei this number has slightly declined owing to an arrangement by which inwail parcels are delivered to the Shaikh's Customs for assessment and recovery of the import duty on them, which was previously evaded. Under p arrangements the public have only the facility of sending their fully correspondence from Kuwait, for no registered articles, parcels nor i orders can be accepted from them by the Political Agent's Office for des™ Consequently merchants, the public and the trade of the port are all severelj handicapped and therefore the remarks in last year's report cannot be too stronglj emphasized—that the most urgent need of the port is the very early inaugura tion of a regular Indian Inland post office in Kuwait similar to those in Bahraii and Maskat. The matter has already been before the Government of India for some years, and it is hoped will receive their favourable consideration ani that they will be pleased to provide a large, flourishing and growing port witl this most elementary necessity of civilization in the very near future. Another necessity which made itself felt acutely during the past sumiM Water Supply, has arisen from the continued growdiii prosperity and population of Kuwait, that of an adequate Water-supply. It will suffice here to state that the ki has for the past few years relied for its fresh water supplies almost entirelj on boats plying to and from the Shatt-el-Arab. How precarious must lie this source of supply will be apparent when it is remembered tliat thj distance is over 60 miles, and the boats are entirely dependent upon wind p weai.her for their sailings. The Shaikh has now realized that if water-famine waicli have become almost weekly occurrences, are to be avoided, he must to a proper water supply system in the town itself whatever the method or costmaj be. He requested that Government would assist him with the expert knof ledge required to determine the merits of various systems and to undertake the whole project; he further gave them the option of retaining the working P their own hands or of handing it over to him on completion as seemed to ttoj best In the latter case he begged that he might be permitted to paythe^ y s^ me suitable instalments The matter is an urgent one, and if it cou , arne nrough before the coming summer, would remove a source of g ie _ adw^on + t . 0Wrl - It remains to be seen what scheme it will ^ S Sefr S 113 to . ado P t and whether GoTermnent will he prepaieu to eiteii lineir assistance m any shape.

This security has resulted from the continuance of the truce between ' Bin 'Saud ' and ' Ibn Rashid/' backed up by the former's strong rule over the Bedouin tribes of the interior. The wells at Al-Gara and As-Safa, which were destroyed by the Shammar last year, were re-opened in January by a party of the Jiblan Umtair. Owing to strained relations continuing between ' Bin Saud ' and the Sheriff of Mecca, the latter prohibited all Nejd people from coming to Mecca, Medina, and other places within his authority in Hedjaz. This measure probably injured the Sheriff more than any one else for, as a consequence, all Nejd traffic has been diverted to Kuwait and Hasa. Trouble is anticipated at Hail between Zamil ibn Sebhan and his cousin, Saud bin Saleh as-Sebhan. The former who is guardian to the young Saud Ibn Eashid ' is well disposed to him, while Saud bin Saleh as-Sebhan, who has a large following, wishes to kill a Ibn Rashid' and usurp the power for the Sebhan family. As the young ' Ibn Rashid ' is the last of his line, that family is on the verge of extinction for no -doubt jealousies between the members of the Sebhan family will ultimately lead to the boy's death, Zamil ibn Sebhan is reported to be an upright fair-dealing man but unfortunately has not the same control in financial matters which Saud bin Saleh possesses through his family connections. ' Ibn Rashid ' and the Shammar appear to have led a particularly 'ibD Eashid-.'' Raid.. peaceful life during the year for only one small raid on the Thaffir tribe was report ed at the end of March. In the second week of December it was reported that ' Ibn Rashid ' had ordered the whole Shammar tribe to concentrate at As-Sabt wells and await his arrival from Hail As-Sabt is some three days north west from Al-Hafar, and it is not yet known against whom ' Ibn Rashid ' intends to move. Bin _Saud with the Umtair, Al-Morrah, Sabai, and Sahul tribes was 'Bin Saud's' Eaids. reported to have left the Urmah plain in February to raid the Ateyba and, on 10th March, a messenger came into Kuwait bringing details of its success near Jabal-au-Nir on the RiadhMecca road ; a considerable amount-of loot in camels and tents was taken and several of the Ateyba Shaikhs submit ted to ' Bin Saud.' Sections of the same tribe were twice again raided by him: once in April at Sha'ara three days wesfc of Shagra when Afas bin Mahaiyah, one of their Shaikhs, was killed with some 25 others, and a second time near Kharmah in south-west Washm when it was said ' Bin Saud ' took some 1,500 camels, 2,000 sheep, 30 horses and a large quantity of tents and camp gear as booty. In the first week of August he raided the Al-Morrah tribe near Kharj. In November a Bin Saud' left Riadh on a tax-collecting tour in Kasim after which it was said he intended to move northwards ; later news received in the second week of December proved, however, that he had returned 'to Riadh, though his force had been kept intact. The 'Araif ' successfully raided the Kahtan tribe in south-west Nejd The 'Araif.' in February. Seeing that no material help was forthcoming from the Sheriff of Mecca, the Araif ' joined the Ateyba tribe about May in their summer pastures near Matmbah on the Riadh and Boreidah roads to Mecca. It is for sheltering the ' Araif ' that this tribe has been continuously harassed and subjected to constant raids by ' Bin Saud'. The improvement of relations between the various tribes reported last Tribal Politics. y ear lias continued, a result hardly to have been anticipated and probably due only to the effective pressure which can be brought to bear by one or other of the three principal rulers, so long as friendly terms and .. the balance of power is maintained between Shaikh Mubarak, ft Bin Saud ' and Jbn Rashid'.116 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT A number of the Umtair, Thaffir, Ajman, and other Shaikhs have Kuwait during the year at yariom +^7 Eedouin shaikh^ Vnits. and most of them called on the Politic i Agent. The notable exception was Faisal bin Sultan-ad-Dawish, the Chi! Shaikh of the Umtair, who is not on good terms now with Shaikh Mubarak and ' Bin Saud/' It appears almost to have crystallized into a custom now fo r Bedouin Shaikhs to call at the Agency during their visits to Kuwait, and the fact is useful in maintaining touch with tribal politics in the interior. Paisal-ud-Dawish, the Chief Shaikh of the Umtair, camped in March in The Umtair Tribe. the ^ ^ W ? lls ^ » reported at various times between that place and Shakra, west of Zobair. He has thrown in his lot with the Muntafick and ' Ibn Rashid ' and consequently is not at present grata mW either Shaikh Mubarak or ' Bin Saud.' News was received on 3rd August that Ishgair bin Muhammed of the Ad-Dawish section of the Umtair tribe had raided the Tawatah section of the Anizah tribe allied to Shaikh Mubarak at Safwan. The Tawatah people were reported to have moved to Jahra and that Shaikh Mubarak contemplated sending a punitive expedition against the raiders, but an apology and restitu tion of looted property prevented what would have led to a rupture the whole Umtair tribe and Mubarak. Tvro small raids by the Ajman tribe were reported to have taken against Ibn Ghanaiman of the L 2man n c ' Umtair and on Awazim and Kuwait Araibdar in the third week of May. Parties of the Ajman tribe, who had been wandering in the vicinity of Kuwait for the purpose of looting stray Bedouins, finally contemplated a raid on some of Shaikh Mubarak's people at Wafra, but news having been communi cated in time by a shepherd, Shaikh Mubarak's men were prepared and wk the raiders arrived on the spot they received more than they bargained for, were defeated and 29 men were brought into Kuwait on the 15th July and imprisoned. Pour of them belonging to the Al-Morrah tribe were released bj the Shaikh on explanation, but the remainder spent some months in prison before being set free.

'FOR THE YEAR 1912. 117 Information was brought in March hj an Ajman Shaikh that the Mutas- sarif of Hasa had visited the Kasr-as-Sabaih settlement some two months before with a number of Turkish soldiers and that he had left a ' Chaush ' (sergeant) with 4 soldiers in Kasr-as-Sabaih. At various times Shaikh Mubarak has replied to the A1 bu Ainain's overtures for his protection that they must give up coquetting with the Turks before he will assist them. They have now definitely placed themselves under the Turkish flag and Mubarak consequently has washed his hands of them. In July the Shaikh contemplated sending his yacht to Bombay for over- shaikh Mubarak's Affairs. haul. It appears ^ that though carefully painted outside, it has never occurred to any one that the yacht's bilges inside would require attention. Consequently her bottom plates and frames are so badly corroded that the lightest blow from a hammer makes a hole. The yacht however has not yet undergone any of the necessary repairs. It is satisfactory to record that Shaikh Salim, Shaikh Mubarak's second son, has taken ^ up his residence in Kuwait. He formerly resided at Puntas and only occasionally visited Kuwait, there being a long estrangement between him and his father. The reconciliation was due to Shaikh Khazal's good offices. A British Indian who has recently been installing electric lighting at Maskat and Mohammerah named N. S. Bayankar after an inspection visitT to the Shaikh's palace, on the|14th October, secured a contract at the end of Octo ber ^ to light the Shaikh's palace with electricity. Shaikh Mubarak told the Political Agent that the contract was for Rs. 7,000 to supply an oil-engine dynamo and 400 lamps. t Tlie Shaikh's position financially appears to have improved materially during the last 2 or 3 years. He is showing a commendable public spirit in taking up various useful projects for the benefit and improvement of his town and people. A water-tank steamer of 300 tons capacity, costing about £7,000, is shortly expected to arrive from England which the Shaikh has ordered for +he purpose of bringing water from the Shatt-el-Arab. Realizing that even this measure will not suffice to obviate periodical water-famines, he submitted his request for Government help in furnishing the town with an adequate and Complete water supply system, as noted elsewhere. Shaikh Mubarak has been making further large purchases of date-gardens on the Shatt-el-Arab. Details are not at present available but he must now own a very considerable area of land on the right bank of the river. He still has difficulty in getting the land registered in his own name and therefore satis fies Turkish requirements by substituting the names of his women and others. This method, though it may suffice for present needs, is not unlikely to lead to considerable trouble on his death and in the subsequent division of his property. The Shaikh's relations with the British Government and their Political Shaikh Mubarak's relations with the British Agent are as friendly and harmonious as Government. could be desired. He has frequently, and with friendly confidence, consulted the Political Agent on various entirely unofficial matters connected with his own and his people's affairs, as an instance of which may be cited his request for the assistance of the Government of India in the matter of providing Kuwait with a water supply system. Shaikh Mubarak seems now to have abandoned entirely the suspicious and obstructive attitude he was formerly occasionally inclined to adopt towards British interests, as for example in the case of the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamers in 1908. His rule is impartial and makes no distinction between Arabs and Christians, and such claims and complaints as have been referred to him by the Political Agent have generally been dealt with promptly and fairly. In September Mr. C. P. Macpherson, a partner in Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., visited Kuwait to arrange for the conversion of their branch agency, hitherto carried on by a clerk, into an agency under a European assistant, liie Shaikh cordially agreed and Mr. D. Hart arrived at the end of the month118 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT to take charge.

A site was selected in September by officers from the Public Works and Persian Gulf Telegraph Departments, and it is hoped the work will shortly be put in hand. On the 16th April it was arranged, on the Political Resident's invitation- The Shaikh's Investiture with K.C.I.E. ^ ^Oin- mander-m-Chief should invest the Shal with the decoration conferred upon him by His Imperial Majesty King Georee V on the occasion of the Delhi Durbar. Through the courtesy of His Ex cellency, Sir Alexander Bethell, the occasion was made an imposing function which will be long remembered in Kuwait. Two Guards of Honour with band landed from the flagship and were mounted at the Shaikh's palace. His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief left the flagship under a salute, the ship being simultaneously dressed, and was received at the Shaikh'! landing-steps by Shaikh Jabir and the Political Agent. He was conducted to the Audience Hall being received at the entrance by Shaikh Mubarak, the Political Resident, and a Guard of Honour of Royal Marines with Band. The Audience Hall had been filled previously with local dignitaries and officers from the flagship while a large crowd had assembled in the adjoining court yards to see the function. After greetings had been exchanged and refreshments served. His Excellency rose and addressed the Shaikh in English, an Arabic translation of his speech being read immediately afterwards. His^ Excellency then invested the Shaikh with the Star and Badge of a Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, while the flagship fired ^ a salute of 12 guns, and Guard and Band gave a general salute. After Shaikh Mubarak had made his acknowledgments coffee was served and His Excellency then took his departure being accompanied bv the Shaikh, the Political Resident, the Political Agent and the Shaikh's family to the landing-steps, where he bid the Shaikh good-bye and entered his galley. On His Excellency's departure the Shaikh's shore battery saluted with 15 guns being followed by a similar salute from the Shaikh's yacht.

The Shaikh was informed that negotiations between the Porte and His Baghadad Railway. Majesty's Government were proceeding with a view to the final settlement of all differences between them concurrently with a solution of the Baghdad Railway terminus question. Interested as he naturally must be in such a matter the Shaikh appears content to leave his own part of the case in our hands, confident that we will obtain for him such terms as may be compatible with his interests. Al; the same time he does not admit that the lapse of time has given the Turkish Government any better right to the points on his boundaries still occupied by their petty detachments. The cordial and intimate relations existing between Shaikh Mubarak and with the shaikh of Mohammerah. Shaikh Khazal continue to be cemented by the exchange of frequent visits. Shaikh Mubarak visited Pailiyah four times during the year in his yacht remaining on each occasion from three to five weeks. Shaikh Khazal with his Secretary, Haji Eais, arrived in Shaikh Mubarak's yacht on the 22nd August escorted by his own launch. He was received by the Shaikh with his usual warmth and hospitality, and after spending about a week in Kuwait the party returned to Mohammerah on the 29th August. Shaikhs Salim bin Mubarak, Ahmed bin Jabir, Ali bin Khalifah and others of Shaikh Mubarak's family have also visited Eailiyah. Friendly relations which were revived last year still subsist between the with the shaikh of Bahrain. Subah ^ a n d Al Khalifah families, though no visits were exchanged. In January the Mission established a Minister in Kuwait and rented with the American Mission. another house from the Shaikh for his use. 3 The staff now consists of a doctor, a ladv doctor, and a Minister assisted by a colporteur and a dispenser. Plans have been prepared and the material ordered for the proposed Mission hospital and work will shortly be commenced on the site which, as alreadv stated in the report for 1910, has been acquired on the west side of the town. * Various members of the Mission from other stations have visited Kuwait during the year, among them Br. Mylrea and Mr. Shaw. Dr. P. W Harrison in the course of his work, visited the pearl-banks by native boat during the diving season, but found himself unable to do much beyond dispensino- a few medicines. b The Shaikh's relations with the Mission have been uniformly friendly and he took pains to provide them with a house when the one already occupied bv them had to be vacated suddenly. 1 ^ Messrs.

The Shaikh gave an evasive reply and sugsrested their addressing themselves first to the Political Resident or the Political Agent.

When Bushire was plague infected Quarantine. j n Pebruary, the Shaikh ordered quarantine to be undergone at Shuwaikh on the mainland, but after having had explained to him how severe the epidemic was in Bushire, and that the large numben of people deserting that place for Kuwait would inevitably introduce tk disease into the town unless securely and properly quarantined, he reverted to the former arrangement. Assistant Surgeon N. M. Eahmatullah, L.M &amp;S., was in charge of the dispensary and quarantine duties until the 17th May when he left for India on the termination of his appointment, being relieved by Military Assistant Surgeon O.C.Kelly, I.S.M.D., who continued in charge for the remainder of the year.

Owing however to some friction and mutual recriminations between them a third man dj' name Yusuf Nasrani had been added to the Customs staff by the Shaikh, In January the Shaikh issued stringent orders for the thorough searcl and inspection of all boats plying between Kuwait and the Shatt-el-Arab oa departure from and arrival in Kuwait. The order was probably connectea with the supposed plot against his life. The duty on the live-stock and camels brought in for sale by land was raised by the .Shaikh towards the end of January from i a Kran on eacfi sheep or goat and Es. 10 on each camel to 10 per cent, of the sale price, w duty on raw wool has also been enhanced to 10 per cent. Shaikh Mubarak having learnt that merchants were using the post offic 6 to evade Customs duty on articles such as gold thread, musk, etc., at beginning of May requested that all parcels which had hitherto been direct to addressees should be handed over to the Customs for assess! recovery of duty. The Political Agent agreed and arrangements, w worked satisfactorily, were made to meet the Shaikh's wishes on the W those obtaining at British offices in the Persian ports.

The news of the institution of the Arms Warehouse in Maskat Arms Traffic was rece i vec l as flight have been expected with some dissatisfaction particularly by those traders still interested in the Arms Traffic. From reports reaching the Political Agent it appears that arms, evidently from old stocks, do still find their way to Kuwait in small quantities probably from Katr, though the high price weapons fetch in Kuwait shows that the traffic cannot be extensive, • About the beginning of April there was an unconfirmed rumour that 1,200 rifles had been landed secretly at Shuwaikh. Some arms certainly appeared to have been landed, but enquiries did not establish their number or from what vessel and in whose interest. A certain amount of feeling was aroused on the arrival of several large buggalows returning from India which had been searched by His Majesty's Ships for arms. As none were found on board and the owners were respect able men the Shaikh took up their complaint rather strongly. The loss and damage suffered in the process of search was subsequently compensated by the Government of India. M. Ibrahim Elbaz, the Trench arms dealer in Maskat, arrived on the 13th June with Nakhoda Mahdu Abdulla. He spent three weeks in Kuwait and left on the 5th July after closing his accounts with his former agent, Abdulla Atiji. He was reported to have approached several merchants for appointment as his agents but the offer was declined. The Shaikh was given permission to import 6,000 arms for his own and his people's use on the understanding that they should not be sold elsewhere. He has not up to date availed himself of the full number permitted. Qnly one application was received for manumission during the year from a Slave Trade local slave woman ; her case was investi gated and subsequently she became recon- . ciled to her master. The Kuwait pearling fleet left for the banks early in May with at least p parl ^ . 100 new boats added. The fleet returned during August for the Eamazan fast month and returned to the banks for a month's fishing during September and October. The catch of pearls was very fair and slightly above average ; prices were, however, very high, and pearl-towashes were compelled to pay dearly for what they bought from the boats. The result has been that the divers have had an excellent season, in a few cases a diver's share having been as much as Es. 1,500 to 2,000, but there were very many, on the other hand, who did not receive more than Es. 200. Three notably fine pearls were fished which were sold from the boats for Es. 47,000, Es. 27,000 and Es. 23,000 respec tively ; the first was a perfect sphere said to be the size of a small marble and to weigh some 17 carats. Prices appear to have ruled quite 20 to 30 per cent, higher than last year, but there was a sudden drop and a stagnant market at the close of the year following on the outbreak of the Turco-Balkan war. News of a piracy off Katr reached Kuwait on 30th December 1912. p iracy The 'victims were it appears a Nakhoda Husein, his son and a Kuwait Arab who had left Kuwait in their own bellam ' for Basrah and thence Katr and Oman ports with a cargo of dates for sale. Whilst returning to Kuwait the three were murdered by the rest of the crew who coveted their goods and money. The crew made for the Persian coast and whilst weather-bound off Eas Naband, the Shaikh of the place, Sagar bin Khalfan, on the information of a negro member of the crew, arrested them.

A traveller by name M. Barclay Eaunkiaer of Danish nationality arrived Foreigners and Traveller,. in Kuwait on 29th January from Basrat, intending to go to Hofhuf.

He was travelling as a Naturalist Explorer under the auspices of the Danish Geo graphical Society, for etnographical, botanical and geographical purposes. He left Kuwait on the 24th February travelling with a caravan to Zilfiand Boreidai; thence he reached Eiadh through Sadair and finally through Hofhuf and Ojair to Bahrain.

It is difficult to say that there has been any improvement in Southern General situation in Persia. Persia generally during 1913. The . financial assistance in the shape of loans granted by Russia and Great Britain has led to some tightening of control, but2 PERSIAN GULF ADMIKISTRATION HEPORT the Pars, Luristan and Kerman reports below go to show that tiglitemiig of control has only led to various lawless acts and rebellions ; the money has been or is rapidly being, spent, and little show of order has resulted, even tempo rarily, and there does not appear to have been any return on the money spent which would encourage one to look forward, with any hope for the future. The country has become more heavily involved in debt, has pledged her resources and there are no increased revenues resulting to pay past obligations in the form of interest, much less repayment of capital, or to meet the future needs of the administration. During the year, a joint advance of £400,000 was provided by Eussia and Great Britain. Of the latter's share, a sum of £30,000 was set aside for the administration of the province of Fars and £10,000 for the construction of a new Customs House at Bushire. A further advance of £100.000 was made by Great Britain expressly for expenditure on the Gendarmerie of Pars. The entire reconstruction of Persian finance and the project of a large loan, from which present obligations are to be met, under tbe control of a European Commission have been discussed, but Persia has practically no security to offer. Considerable reductions in the small numbers of British troops in southern Persia have been effected, and the strength of the Biitish Indian troops on Persian soil hardly amounts to a strong half battalion, but no appreciable reduction has followed of Russian troops in the North.

In addition to the above, the lamp at the Telegraph Station at Jask which was used to show a light for the 44 Patrick Stewart' when previous notice had been given, has been replaced by a lantern of the type used as ship 's headlights and is now shown as a permanent light. Similar arrangements are under contemplation at Chahbar and Henjam. In connection with the lighting and buoying scheme, a plot of land , with a godown and carbide store has been rented from the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany in their concession at Abadan ; plans for a permanent depdt and slipway are being prepared by Mr. C. J. Homer, Assistant Engineer in charge, Persian Gulf Lighthouse Works. The proposal for a beacon on Halul Island has again been put forward. The want of a vessel to undertake the duties of lighthouse tender has been severely felt during the past year, and it appears that the vessel is now only just past the 'estimate ' stage. No further steps have been taken to install the wireless stations which Wireless installation. we f sanctioned by the Secretary of State earl y ln las t year owing to the detailed estimates having greatly exceeded the original estimates. The temporary station at Eeshire has given some trouble as regards the transmitting station ; messages have been sent on behalf of the local Persian authorities without exciting remark. The permanent station at Jask has continued to work satisfactorily during the year. This installation figures in the ' Official list of Radio-Telegraph Stations ' published at Berne. It is understood that all the new ships, belonging to the British India Steam Navigation Company, which have been constructed or are under construc tion for the Gulf run. are, or will be, fitted with wireless telegraphy. Great developments have taken place during the past year in the Gendar- Gendarmerie merie Scheme - ^ the administrative area of the Residency there are detach ments at Shiraz and Kerman, the former being in occupation of the Bushire- fchiraz road. These detachments are dealt with in detail in the district reports. The Persian officers are their great weakness; once away from their owe dish officers they are all too apt to relapse into brigandage and rapine. b 34 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Throughout the south, it is believed among all classes that the Gendarmerie is the special protege of His Majesty's Government, and their mistakes, if such occur, are laid to our charge. The doings of the Turkish Consulate, a curiously unnecessary institutioh at this port and due to Sunni intrigue insa ' afforded some mild interest during the year and Lingah has been unfortunate in not sharing, with the rest of the Persian Gulf Ports, in the improvement that time seems to have been gradually bringing about in the relations between His Majesty's representatives and the Customs administration. A decrease in arms ^ smuggling is noticed and it is satisfactory that His Majesty's Vice-Consul anticipates a considerable improve ment in trade from the successful expedition of the Kawam-ul-Mulk against the Laris. Lingah was successful in securing the culprits in two flagrant cases of piracy, committed against Kuwait dhows. Bandar Abbas sounds a cheerful note; there has been greater security and Indian merchants have had a fairly pros- Bandar Abbas. perous year. It is always a matter for congratulation when a Persian Governor is able to remain at his post for 12 months and the Deputy Governor, Shuja-i-Nizam, appears well suited to th^ rather backward district he is called to administer. Pandar Abbas seems also to have cause for self-congratulation in its last Director of Customs, and it is a pleasure to note the cordial relations between both these officials and His Majesty's Consul. The report is however compelled to record the robbery and maltreatment, in the month of Februaryj of Mr. Greene of the Karachi Exten sion Railway by Baharlus within 30 miles of the town of Bandar Abbas itself, while a similar attempt was made, one month later, by a more formidable band of the same tribesmen. On this occasion, the survey party were forewarned and forearmed and gave the raiders a warm reception. But before these marauders would quit the district, it was again found necessary to land British forces. In the interests of British trade. Captain Biscoe draws attention to the crying need for cheap telegraphic communication with the interior, a matter which has the attention of the Government of India. ** There seems to be no chance of any arrangement being come to between „ ^Messrs. Strick and Messrs. Ellinger over Hormuz Oxide. . , , the matter. The Moin has been very troublesome over the fulfilment of Messrs. Strick's contract. Coal has been landed at Henjam from time to time without raising any „ , , TI . comment from the Persian Government. Coal at Hen]am. The two important events of the year in Kerman have been the reorgani- Kermaa sation of the revenue department under European control, and the entry of a force of Persian Gendarmerie on the scene. As regards the first, Captain Lorimer is bold enough to predict that the effects of the measure may, on the whole, be beneficial; he adopts an attitude of prudent reserve on the second. The Amir-i-Mufakham continued Governor of the Province until October 1913 when he was dismissed after an ineffectual struggle with Mr. Lecoffre, the Finance Agent. Several petty squabbles preceded the final disaster.^ The Bakhtiari Khan proceeded on tour to Bam in early March and remained in the district until early July. The tour was successful from the point of view of the maintenance of order, but a failure as regards the collection of revenue. A similar tour, or rather raid, into Baluchistan, which His Excellency planned in the autumn, was discouraged from Tehran. In the place of the dismissed Governor, his brother Sirdar Muhtasham was appointed but did not join his post during the year. The province wou not appear to have suffered from his absence and the locum tenens, p ir Nasrat, proved satisfactory. The cry of &lt;c no more Bakbtiaris ' recorded wi some appearance of sympathy by His Majesty's Consul, deserves notice. TT—FOR THE TEAR 1913. ft A strike of carpet weavers, in October, is estimated to have cost Foreign carpet mercliants £1,000. Baluch raids, as usual, afflicted the province, notably that on Tahrud in May and again on Jiruft in November. An interesting and remarkably full account of municipal affairs and intrigues of Kerman city will be found in Captain Lorimer's report. It was only at the end of the year that the Gendarmerie arrived. The Swedish officers in charge were handicapped by illness and ignorance of the East, and the force has not yet had time to produce any effect good or bad in Kerman. The report notices the Trans-Persian Railway project and the proposed. Trans-Persian Railway and Kerman Mining Kerman Mining Concession. Neither Concession. ^ have so far materialised, but the country between Karachi and Kerman was again thoroughly examined and, in the course of this examination, some attention was paid to the mineral resources of the country round Kerman. The impressions gathered were unfavourable. The cheerful and innocuous anarchy, anticipated in last year's review, Perso -Makian Coast. would seem to have characterised this district during the year. Mir Barkat, who used to be such a disturbing factor, appears to have settled down to dull respectability. The fact of Bampur being abandoned to Mir Islam Khan of Binth is significant, as well as the reported intention of that Chief to oppose any attempts of the Persians to^ re-assert their authority in Baluchistan. The contingency is so remote, that it hardly seems likely 1914^e P eaCe C0UIltl 7 sicle be disturbed by Persian activity during During the year, post offices have been opened to the public at Henjam Post offices. aild Charbar. The Mohammerah report, as might be expected in the case of the most Arabistan. flourishing and progressive port in the Gulf, contains many matters of interest. German progress needs careful watching, especially when our Consul is con vinced that their success is, partly at all events, based on smuggling. The Belgians do not seem to have made themselves popular in the district and attacks on them and friction between them and the Shaikh, due to their attempts to encroach on His Excellency's prerogatives, form a feature of this year's report, as they have done in the past. An abortive attempt to establish a Persian post office at Abadan brought them into conflict with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, and His Majesty's Representative. The question of increasing accommodation at the British Post Office at Mohammerah and of the establishment of new officers at Abadan and Ahwaz were under consideration at the close of the year. The Mohammerah-Ahwaz-Borasjan section has been handed over to the Indo-European Telegraph Department during the year. The needs of Mohammerah in the matter of hospital, school and road are discussed by His Majesty's Consul. It is satisfactory to note the progress made by the two most notable local British enterprises, the Ansrlo-Persian Oil Company and the Mohammerah Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia during the past year. An event of considerable importance and much local interest to Moham- merah was the arrival there of the members of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission. No serious work, beyond that of preparation, was done before the close of the year. The Mohammerah report also contains an interesting account of the progress made up to the end of the year of the Mohammerah-Khurramabad Railway project; the set-back appears to be only temporary, and we may look for some advance before the present year closes.6 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTEATION REPORT Major Haworth lays stress on the importance of clearly informing the Persian Government of the exact position of affairs between us and Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, and the necessity under which we lie of seeing that His Excellency's rights are respected. Captain Grey gives an interesting account of the unsuccessful Bakhtiari expedition against the Kuhgelu tribes, in February, and shows how the result in May was that the Sirdar-i-Jang was eventually obliged to disburse a modified ** blackmail' in the shape of pay to Kuhgelu road guards, a temporary palliative, very satisfactory for the Kuhgelu tribesmen and not unfavourable for trade during the summer months. Time alone will show whether the criticisms of the other Bakhtiari Chiefs who condemn this arrangement are well- founded. Much of the report is taken up with the dispute between the Shaikh of Mohammerah and the Sirdar-i-Jang over the Jarrahi lands. Actual fighting was circumvented with difficulty, but a satisfactory settlement, which, it is hoped, may prove lasting, was at last arrived at, in November, when the title deeds of the lands in dispute were at length made over to Shaikh Khazal. The work of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company proceeded satisfactorily in this part of the country, and the relations between the Company and the Bakhtiaris were excellent. This Agency has seen a troubled year. The politics of the interior were in a state of turmoil and a serious rising as a ' of the tribes clouded the last few months of the rule of His Highness Sir Saiyid Faisal bin Turki, G. C- I. E. The latter died in the early days of Oatober after a reign of 25 years. His successor and eldest son, Saiyid Taimur, came peaceably to power, on the 15th November, and letters from the French and British Consuls, announcing his recognition as Sultan by their respective Governments were presented to His Highness. The Maskat Warehouse for the storage of arms and ammunition offered for sale to the Omani public and other approved purchasers would appear, from the figures g : vea by the Political Agent, to have justified its existence. Two notable figures of Maskat local celebrity, the arms trader Ali Musa Khan and the Customs Superintendent, Abdul Karim have, at least temporarily, been removed from Oman owing to the;r contravention of the regulations of this useful institution. Unfortunately there is little room for doubt that to the practical suppres sion of the arms traffic is also due the formidable rising among the tribes that has darkened Oman history during the year under report, and, but for British support, would still some months later be a serious menace to the continued existence of Maskat as the capital. The Agency report gives a full Mstory of the rising, and it is not too much to say that it was only the timely arrival of the 2nd llajputs under Lieut.-Colonel Smith, coupled with the strong support of His Majesty's ships, in the early days of July, that saved the Sultanate. Maskat indeed cannot be too grateful to Bushire for the prompt response to His Highness's appeal for help, by which, within 3 days, the Eajput Wing was landed ready for any work that they might be called on to do, at Mattra. On Lieut.-Colonel Smith and his men fell the full brunt of preparing for the land defence of Maskat and Mattra in the torrid heat of July and August and what that means only those who have lived in Maskat really know. The conduct of the troops, as indeed was only to be expected, and their relations with the inhabitants have been excellent. The end of the Abu Musa Oxide Case seems at last, after a lapse of 7 Abu Musa. years, within measurable distance of una Oxide. solution. Messrs. Wonckhaus and Oo. have agreed in principle to accept a lump sum down in settlement. Figures have been put forward, through the German Embassy in London, as a basis for estimating the compensation for the cancellation of the contrac, after due examination, it is proposed to submit the figures, supplied by t e firm, to an independent tribunal, possessing the business experience necessary to fix the amount of compensation eventually to be paid.FOR THE YEAR 1913. 7 The history of Bahrain during the past year contains little of interest, and Bahrain. extent Bahrain may be considered '' fortunate'. The usual troubles c mnect- ed with the landing of merchandise prevailed, but some headway against the natural defects of the port, enhanced by the curious attitude of the Ruler and his Arab subjects towards reform, has been made and we may be on the eve of better things. Shaikh Isa, it is satisfactory to note, is younger than ever and appears to thrive on the protests of modern haste and civilisation. The mainland, on the contrary, cannot complain of being dull and in Persian Gulf politics perhaps the most important event of the year and one which may be expected to have far-reaching effects, has been the occupation of A1 Hasa, in early May, by the Amir Abdul Aziz bin Saud. Little resistance was offered by the small Turkish garrison or local Ottoman authorities, who all left Bahrain eventually on the 1st June. It is too early jet to prophesy what the eventual outcome of this bold move of the Amir may be, but it is hard to see how the Porte will be able to recover the territory thus rudely torn from its authority and one may at least be permitted to hope that this comparatively fruitful province, rich in possibili ties, will not, in the future, remain so entirely closed to all foreign enterprise, and commerce, as it has been during the last fifty years of its history under Turkish domination. An interesting interview between the Amir and the Political Agents, Bahrain and Kuwait, representing the Resident, took place in December, as the outcome of the appearance of Bin Saud as a ruler on the shores of the Persian Gulf. His friendly demeanour and anxiety to meet British sugges tions produced a most favourable impression. The death of Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad ath Thani of Katar, in July, and the peaceful succession of his second son Abdullah receive notice in Major Trevor's report. His Majesty's Government have decided that it is inexpedient to promul- The Bahrain Order in Council. ^ ^ 1 enf ° rCe Bahrain Order in Council locally, till such time as the Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 29th has been ratified and passed out of the minds of the general public. The same hopeful tone of steady progress that has been noticed in previous Kuwai |. years pervades the Kuwait report again this year and shows the benefit of the rule of one strong man in these Arab principalities if he can only be found. The serious illness of Shaikh Mubarak in the early part of the year was a grave anxiety. The well-known longevity of Arab Shaikhs in the Persian Gulf encourages one to hope that such a public calamity as the death of this farsighted and politic ruler may yet for many years be deferred. His life's work, however, may be said to be crowned by the signature of the Anglo-Turkish Convention which, as the Political Agent well remarks, regularises the status of Kuwait. The usual proofs of Shaikh Mubarak's enl'ghtened policy were forthcom ing this year in his reception of the Commission of Oil experts headed by Rear Admiral Sir Edmund Slade, K.C.I E., K C.V.O. It is satisfactory to relate that the friendship between the I: wo riverain Arab Shaikhs on the Shatt-el-Arab continues as firm as ever. In November of 1912, Shaikh Sir Mubarak-rs-Subah asked the help of ^ o Government in a scheme for the provision nwait ater upp y. 0 £ a SU ppiy of sweet water to Kuwait, a matter of urgent local importance. Two alternatives presented themselves :— (1) The establishment of a condenser. (2) An attempt to tap some artesian source of supply. In April of the present year, a report on the lat'er project was submitted by Mr. Pascoe of the Geological Survey of India, who was strongly in favour% 8 PERSIAN GULR ADMINISTRATION REPORT of a trial boring although evidence of the presence of water was insufficient to allow of any certain judgment being given : the members of the Slade Com mission, who visited the locality later, expressed the opinion that a test borin? would be necessary. No reliable data as to the probable cost of such an opera tion could be procured, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, when approached stated that the only terms on which they were prepared to take up the enter prise was on the basis of a percentage of the total cost. It was, therefore pro posed to ask the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to sink a trial boring on' some arrangement of this nature, but later opinion favours the condenser, and estimates are being called for and carefully studied. S. G. KNOX, M AJOR, Offg. Political Uesident in the Persian Oulf t pK)R THE TEAR 1913. 9 The Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf during 1913. The measures for the suppression of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf General Review. during the year ending December 31st, 1^13, were conducted on the same lines, and sanctioned on the same scale, as those of the preceding year. The trade, how ever, so far from suffering any abatement, continued brisk and flourishing' and, towards the close of the year, even showed signs of recrudescence. The arena of gun-running became considerably enlarged, and continued to move westward. Prom the date of the opening of the bonded warehouse in Maskat, namely, September 1st, 1912, that port rapidly ceased to be a distributing centre, but its place was taken by a number of small depdts which were scattered chiefly amongst the Oman hills and along the Batinah coast. Some of these situated in or near the Wadi Samail became absorbed during the rising in Oman which first began to assume serious proportions in the month of May. Dep6ts are now to be found at Barkah, Masna'ah, Suwdq, Khaburah, Khadhra and Sohar. Along the coast of Trucial Oman there are stocks of rifles at Khasab, Dibai, Sharjah, and A-bu Dhabi j while in A1 Katr the trade still rests mainly with Dohah. With the travel 1 ing of the storm-centre westward, the town of Kuwait has become more and more affected, and at the present time it is the largest emporium at the northern end of the Gulf Such names as Euc Hilleh, Khor Mashur, and Ram Hormuz, are increasingly familiar in the sphere of arms traffic ; and Basrah and Mohammerah are responsible for a greater number of arms now than formerly. Most of these places have regularly contributed their small, dhow-borne consignments of arms and ammunition to south-eastern Persia. As rifles continued to dribble into Mekran from the south, so Afghans continued to dribble in from the north ; and during the year under report a far larger number of rifles reached Kabul from Mekran than during the pre ceding year. It was at first thought that these isolated stocks of arms on the Arab coast would soon become exhausted, or at any rate cease to be of any account : but in vieAV of the fact that, after supplying local needs, they were still able to despatch nearly 8,000 rifles, and upwards of 650,000 rounds, to the Persian coast from their surplus, it seems tolerably clear that these dep6ts are being replen ished by some means or other. There are two principal potential sources of supply. Firstly, there are the large allotmenis of arms and ammunition which are made periodically by the Sultan of Maskat to the lesser Shaikhs of the Oman confederacy, and which oddly enough are not referred to in the Ware house report. Secondly, there are the similar consignments which are cons tantly passing through the Maskat warehouse for the Shaikhs of Kuwait, Mohammerah, Bahrain and other places, as well as for various Governors,' Chiefs, and Sirdars. The aggregate of issues on these two counts represents very large quantities both of arms and ammunition upon which there is no sort of check, and the ultimate disposal of which is by no means free from suspicion. So far we are on firm ground ; but when we approach the question as to whether, or not, any of the Gulf ports, other than Maskat, are receiving sup plies direct from Europe, we must tread cautiously. Even allowing that many of the rifles issued from the warehouse under the two foregoing headings find their way into unauthorised hands, it is difficult to understand how these dep6ts are able to maintain themselves as distributing centres unless they are supplied independently of the warehouse altogether. This, of course, can only be done in two ways, by land and by sea. Now to bring arms down to the Arab coast across the desert would involve enormous risk if indeed it were practicable at all ; whereas to smuggle them in amongst the thousands of bales of merchandise which are delivered almost weekly at the various ports of call would be a matter of great simplicity. The logical conclusion is therefore that the ocean-going steamers are at all events helping to keep these dep6ts supplied, a theory that is in no way inconsistent with the information at our disposal. c10 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT The Arms Warehouse at Maskat, which came into existence on September The a ™ Warehouse. 1st, 1912, been of very great assistance m the suppression of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, an:l since its institution the imports of arms and ammunition into Maskat hive fallen off ia a romxrkibla mxnasr It will b3 roaillei tint at the opening of the warehouse, tho local authorities were alike unabie to compel the bringing into Maskat of the large stocks of arms which had been accumulated in the Oman hills and along the Batinah coast, or t) prevent the dealers from sending out of Maskat every round and rifle tliey could lav their hands on. These circumstances gave rise to the state of affairs reviewed in the preceding paragraph. As a set-off against them, however, it can be fairly claimed that, of the former infiltrations of arms and ammunition into Oman, barely one-tenth is now reaching the inhabitants. A carefully compiled annual report, reviewing the working of the arms warehouse during the first, year of its institution, was issued by the warehouse superintendent in October last. Oa the whole the warehouse seems to have been well run, though there was evidently some slackness in regard to the issue of arms and ammunition as samples A noticeable feature was, however that neithor the deposits nor the withdrawal of rifles on behalf of the Sultan of Maskac were sh)wa at all. Tho absjnca of these details detracted from the yalue of aa otherwiso satisfying report, doaling as they do with the items under which leakage is most likely to occur. Out of a fleet of 9 ships belonging to the East Indies Squadron, 5 have Kaval Measures bcen maintained more or less in the Persian Gulf for blockade purposes. These ships have been assisted by four armed launches to which the E. I M. S. Minto has anted as parent ship These launches have been responsible for most of the patrol work which has been done during the year Since the month of August, only one ship has been continuously available for blockade purposes, with the result that oporatio is were latterly greatly relaxed. This may have given rise to the opinion, apparea^ly prevailing in Mokran, that tae British Government are no longer greatly concernel about the arms traffic. Ovving to the suallness of thj consignmonfcs leaving the Arab coast, and the wide area of the trade, no captures cithor of arms or ammunition were effected throughout the year, and bat few jettisonings claimed. Hear-Admiral K. H. Peirse, C B., M.V.O., assumed command of the East Indies Squadron in January 1913. At the end of the same month, a cutter with 9 men under Lieutenant Smith, belonging to II M. S. Fersem, was lost off the Persian coast near JVlugam. In June, combined naval and militarv operations took place against a portion of the Tangistan coast, the inhabitants of which had been responsive for a piracy on a Dibai boat in August .1911 The operations began on the l4lhof June, and were completed on the 24th of June. The village of Madumari was the first objective. After some preliminary shelling, a landing was effected, in the face of a certain amount of opposition, for the purpose of launching or destroying the dhows belonging to the village. One seaman was killed and five wounded during the landing, As some of the villagers from Dilbar took part in the opposition on this occasion their village was next attacked, by a combined force of 230 men of the 2nd Hajputs, and 200 blue jackets and marines from the ships. While the village was being demolished the ccn ering party was subjected to a heavy fire from hostile riflemen, of whom 100 were mounted. There were no casualties on our side. On June 24th, some dhows were removed from Khor Khuwaiv. Altogether 20 dhows were destroyed, and 11 were taken to Kha ag Island Previous to this the village of Dilbar had been a considerable gun-running centre, and traded largely r ™ . Katr. These operations had a most salutary effect upon the arms traffic in Tangistan, In the following month, four or five of the blockade ships were ordered o concentrate at Maskat in consequence of a threatened rising in Oman Alter some weeks they dispcrged, and were then sent- to Bombay to refU.FOR THE YEAR 1913. 11 In March 1913, the garrisons of Jask and Charbar were reduced to 40 and Miiiiary Measures. ^ ^en respectively, the headquarters of the /nd Eajpu^s being transferred to Bushire. About the same time a detachment of that regiment was sent to protect the Consulate at Bandar Abbas on account of a threatened attack by Borne of the neighbouring tribesmen The detachments both here and at Lingah, are consular guards, but the cost of their accommodation, together with thos3 of Jask, Charbar and Henjam, is debifcable to Arms Traffic. The 39th Central India Horse left Shiraz in April, and embarked at Beshire for India on the 16th, 17th, and 29di of April. About 230 men of the 2nd Rajputs, and the Intelligence Officer, Persian Gulf, took part in the operations on tlu Tangistan coast, to which reference has already been made. On July pth, in consequence of a threatened! rising in Oman, 250 men of the 2nd llajputs from Bushire were sent to protect Maskat and Matrah, at the express request of the Sultan. The rising was caused by the acquiescence of the Sultan to the establishment of an arms w^rehou^ at Maskat. The troops encamped at Bait-al-Falaj, about 11 miles from Matrah, and the same distance from Uuwi. On September 3rd, the srarrison was augmented by the arrival of a wing of the 102nd Grenadiers, and a portion of the 13th Mule Corps, vhich brought up the total of troops in Oman to over 700 of ail ranks. In December, a double company of the 95th (Russell's) Infantry arrived at Jask, and shortly after the remaining wing of the 102nd Grenadiers arrived in Bushire, relieving the 2nd llajputs who left for India on the 23rd December. A General Staff Officer is employed in the Persian Gulf as Intelligence System of intelligence. Officer whose headquarters was changed CS*** in April from Jask to Bushire. In 1912 the Navy also employed an Intelligence Officer, but the appointment was discontinued at the beginning of the year under report. Major S. G. Craufurd, C.I.E., D.S O , was Military Intelligence Officer from 1910 to April 1913, when his place was taken by Major C. C. R. Murphy, Indian Army, who performs the duties of both. The Indian Police maintain a Sub-Inspector and two Head Constables at Maskat, and a Head Constable at Jask, under a District Superintendent, on special duty, whose headquarters are at Karachi. The Director of the Persian Gulf Section of the Indo-European Telegraphs ia employed on special political duty in Mekran, under the orders of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. There is also a combined patrol and telephone establishment in those parts under the telegraph officer in charge of the Jask Sub-division, for the purpose of giving information concerning the landing of arms on the coast between Jask and Charbar, and also in regard to the presence of Afghans in that neighbourhood.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR EARS AND BUSHIRE FOR THE YEAR 1913. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, held charge of the ^ ^ office of Political Resident in the Persian Residency and Consular Staff. Gulf aad His Majesty's ConSUl-GeneS for Ears and Bushire until the 8th December ; when he proceeded on leave to England. He was relieved by M!r J. G. Lorimer, C.I.E., I.C.S 3 who continued to hold charge to the end of the year. Captain L Bird wood held the office of First Assistant to the Resident throughout the year, while Lieutenant P. G. Loch, on the 18th March, relieved Captain A. T. Wilson, C IM G., of the post of Second Assistant. On relief,. Captain Wilson was appointed Additional Assistant to the Political Pvesi- dent in the Persian Gulf for special duty in Khuzistan with effect from the 18th March. He left on the 24ith March for Dizful and proceeded on leave from Mohammerah on May 8th. He arrived at Tehran on 9th September, handed over to Captain Crosthwaite on the 9th November and towards the end of the year proceeded to take up his appointment on special duty as Deputy Commissioner Tnrco-Persian Frontier Commission. Captain C. B. McConaghy, I M.S., performed the duties of Residency Surgeon until the 4th April when he proceeded on leave and was relieved by Major S. Hunt, I M.S. Captain G. G James, I.M.S, Mobile Assistant, vacated the post of Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Officer in the Persian Gulf in June 1913, and was not replaced. Mr. Vice-Consul H. G. Chick held charge of the Vice-Consulate throughout the year. Mr. C. J. Edmonds remained as Consular Assistant during the same period. The post of His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz was filled by Major W. P. T. O'Connor, C I.E., throughout the year. Monsieur Dmitrieff held charge of the Russian Consulate-General until ^ . T , , his death by suicide, on the 10th March; foreign Interests.^ of ^ ^ ^ Monsieur Loiko until his transfer to Baghdad on relief by Monsieur Belayew, on the 17th August, On the 6th November Monsieur Belayew relinquished his charge to join the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission. Monsieur Loiko again returned to relieve Monsieur Belayew and continued to hold charge until the end of the year. Doctor H. Listemann, German Consul, proceeded on leave on the 19th May. He was relieved by Herr Wassmuss who held charge throughout the remainder of the year. This is the same Herr Wassmuss who held charge of the German Consulate during a previous leave taken by Dr. Listemann in 1909 and 1910. Mr. A. H. Wright, Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, was in charge of the Norwegian Vice-Consulate until 22nd April when he was reb'eved by Mr. F. H. C. Gibbs, also of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who held charge till the end of the year. Monsieur Aguiah Bey, Turkish Consul, held charge until his departure on leave, on the 11th July. Nejed Redjeb replaced him on the 21st December and remained in charge until the end of the year. His Majesty's Consul-General continued to hold charge of the French Vice-Consulate and of the Dutch Consulate throughout the year.I'OIl THE YEAR 1913, 13 Mirza Ali Muhammad Khan, Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh, continued to hold Persian Officials. charge of the office of Governor of the Gulf Ports throughout the year. Bushire has been fortunate in that it has not been exposed to the change of Governors, so frequent in other parts of Persia and so detrimental to progress and a good government. Our present Governor is enlightened, by no means opposed to progressive measures, and appears to have the welfare of his charge at heart. Some municipal reforms have been effected and others are planned with some hope of their realisation. Shiraz and Ears have also retained the services of the same Governor- fiove-nor-General of Fars. General throughout the year. The Mukh- bir-es Sultaneh was however none too secure in his seat. His relations both with the gendarmerie and the Finance weie at times strained to breaking point; in the course of the summer he resigned. His grievance was that neither the Pinancial Agent nor the Comman dant of the^gendsrmerie consulted him nor did they obey his orders. His resignation was not accepted and he was soon persuaded to return to Shiraz arid resume his duties. He must however be given credit for useful work in more or less keeping the peace between the two rival factions at Shiraz and, on the whole, during 1913, the situation in Ears showed some slight improve ment on the previous year. The Darya Begi continued at Shiraz throughout the year and was a constant source of solicitude to His Excellency the Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh, Governor of Bushire, who was unceasing in his accusations as to the intrigues of the former to oust him from his post, without however much result. Mirza Ahmad Khan, Masud-es-Sultaneh, continued to hold the post of Karguzar Eoreign Office Agent at Bushire through out the year. He is the present Gover nor's brother and follows his policy of looking to the Besidency for support. He seems to be a 'persona grata ' with the Eoreign element in Bushire and a satisfactory incumbent. Last year's report under this heading dealt with the arrest and imprison- Ealantar and Kadkhada. , of Mashedi Abdul Easul and the disturbances that resulted therefrom. The Governor of the Gulf Ports compelled him, in the beginning of the year, to sign a promissory note for Krans 45,000 payable on demand and, on the 16th January, finally released him on the intervention of Shaikh Ali Dashti and and on the security of Mirza Muhammad, Kazeruni. The appointment of Abdur Riza Kban as Kalantar was also noticed at the end of last year. This man, though not entirely satisfactory, is probably the best man who can be found to hold charge of this appointment. He remained at his post throughout the year and nominally performs, in addition, the duties of Chief of Police. It was reported last year that the task of collecting the revenue of the Gulf Ports had been entrusted to the Customs Administration. The arrange- -p. ... menc continued in force throughout the Financial Agency. , ,. ™ ~ - present year; some difficulties arose be tween the Belgian officials and the Governor over the matter of his personal salary and the supply of funds to carry on the local adtr inistration, in which, on the whole, His Escellency appeared to be really badly treated and was successfully supported by the Besidency; apart from this the arrangement worked better than might have been expected. r lhe Governor-General of Fars had, at the beginning of the year, appointed the Masud-al-Mamalik to the post of Governor, or zather Mamur, of Dashti' and Dashtistac, but no progress was made in the matter of revenue collection. In June, a suggestion came from Shiraz that, as the Ears Administration &lt; was quite unable to collect the revenues of the districts of Dashti and Dashtistan, it would be as well to hand over these districts to the Governor of Bushire. who might be able to do something.14 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Some opposition was at first shown to the transfer by the Mukhbir-es- Sultaneh but he eventually desf atoliecl a telegram to the Muwaggar-ed D'Avleh entrusting the government to him. This reform had bee:i for ^ome time ur^ed by this Ee&gt;iderjcy, as a glance at the rrap will su^ce to show that these dis'ricts can be easiest controlled by the Governor of the Gu f Ports who has access to them both by land and sea. Relations between the Governor-General of Ears and the Governor of the Gulf Ports were not altog ther as cordial as they might have been. At least once in the course of the 3 ear, the Governor-General pressed for the Governor's dismissal and his replacement by the Darya Begi This attempt at the control of the Gulf Ports by the iars Administration was happily frustrated, but such attempts are most objectionable as detrimental to British interests and success ful administration. Monsieur A. Constant held the post of Provincial Director of Customs Cugtoin8 until Monsieur Zwinne a rived at the end of March to tak^ over charge. Monsieur Constant left Bush ire for Europe at the end of April. Monsieur Zwinne remained in charge the post of Customs Director until the end of the year. Monsieur Constant continued to maintain the satisfactory attitude so favour ably commented on in last year's report and Monsieur Z\\i-ine a'so seems to have turned over a new leaf and, beyond occasional attempts at double dealing which he appears unable to resist, showed no signs of reverting to his Eandar Abbas vagaries' during 1913. On the 8th March, as Monsieur Constant. Belgian Director of Customs, - Constant ' ontego. f ld Madame Constant were driviu- home from an entertainment m Bushire Town, they were stopped and fired at at close quarters by an unknown Persian, armed with a revolver. The assassin Mas alone and ran alongside the trap while he fired four times. Madame Constant was shot dead immediately and her husbar.d was severely wounded. The funeral of Madame Constant took place on the 9th March at the Roman Catholic cemetery at Bushire and was attended by His Excellency the Governor, tlie European community and other friends. On the l Uh March, Monsieur Mornard, the Treasurer-General requested His Majesty's Minister ac Tehran to express to the Resident 'in his own name and in that o c the Belgian Ctistoms Service his deepest thanks for all that you have done for Constant to assist his recovery and for your kindness in seeing tLat the funeral of his unfortunate wife was befitting the sad occasion.' Monsieu: Constant's own theory of this cowardly and treacherous act was that he was attacked as representative cf the Treasurer-General. He was always opposed to the performance of Treasury duties by the Customs officials. His Excellency the Governor came to the conclusion that one, Shaikh Shahab, a dismissed employe of the Customs Department, had instigated the murder out of revenge for his dismissal; this man had been enlisted in the gendarmerie and appeals to have been a prime mover in the mutiny of the gendarmerie {vide infra) which followed close on the ' Constant' murder. He absconded, on the 10th April, and w r as never arrested in spite of the many attempt^ made to effect his capture. Another individual, Mitza Ali Khan, another dismissed employe of the Customs, who was also subsequently enlisted in the gendarmerie, w T as airested on suspicion of being the actual murderer. He was heavily indebted to the Customs department, had been sold up and imprisoned by them for several months on aocount of a deficit of 300 tomans in his accounts but, though he remained in confinement until the end of the year, no satisfactory evidence came to light against either this man or Shaikh Shahab, and the actual perpe trators of the outrage are still unknown. In April 1913, an official application w^as made by the Belgian Legation for an indemnity of 1,25,000 francs. This application received the support of His Majesty's Legation at Tehran, who, on the 7th May, informed the Resident that the Persian Government had consented to the payment of the indemnity.TOTL THE YEAR 2913. 15 Monsieur Constant left Bushire for Belgium on the 28th Anril The' Constant 'outrage at once brought forward prominently' the danger to which the foreign community at Bushire Transfer of Headq^rtors of fhP 2rd Qneen was exposed bv the nrofoun-l nf Vic'otias Own Uajput Light lafantry from Jask nT1 n rr &gt;. L * J\ 'U- x i f « to Buahire. anarchy leached in tlie hinterland of Bushiieand the dangerous impotence of the local authorities.' Foreign Consular representatives (on one occasion a meeting of the Consu lar body was proposed) appealed to Sir Percy Cox, asking what measures could be taken to promote order and security and thus free the Consuls from their responsibility vis a vis their respective Governments. Sir Percy Cox undertook to provide guards for such Foreign residents as had not, like the Russian Consul, their own Consular guards, from the troops then at L'ushire and urged on Government the transfer of the headquarters of the Regiment then serving at Jask, to Bushire His recommendations were accepted After some useful work against the Tangistanis, the strength of the regiment was greatly reduced by the transfer of a wing, under t e command of Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, to Maskat inear'yJuly. They were relieved at the end of the year by a wing of the 102nd King Edward's Own Grena diers under Major A. C. Edwards, but the wing is under strength and barely sufficient to furnish guards to tho houses of Europeans and protect its own depfit at Bushire. It will hardly yet have been forgotten that last year's Administration ' Eckford regreUable incident.' Report for Pars and Bushire gave in . # some detail an account of the death of Captain Eckford. His Majesty's Minister had expressed the opinion that, as the Persian Government would undoubtedly be unable to capture th6 guilty or bring them to justice, it was desirable that Government should take steps to prepare an expedition in the spring to restore order and, if necessarv, punish offenders on the Bushire-Shiraz road. The Dai ya Begi left Shiraz on 22nd December of last year to organise, on beLall: of the Governor-General, a small local force of some 600 men with a view to subsequent punitive operations His expedition proved useless and he returned to Shiraz on the 28th January. Sir E. Grey objected to a punitive expedition in the spring on the score that it would lead to disappearance of the pretence of Persian independence and to tlie partition of Persia, directly due to the action of the British Govern ment. We were to renew our efforts to strengthen the Persian adininistratioji and to give support and encouragement to the gendarmerie. A public apology for the outrage either by the Persian Government or the Governor-General of Pais was also suggested If this was not considered sufficient, other measures, more useful and less embarrassing than an expedi tion into the interior, were put forward, e g., the consolidation of our interests and position at the entrance to the Gulf at Hen jam or Bandar Abbas. Landing of troops at Bushire or Kharag island was also sugges + e r l in the event of it being considered that Bandar Abbas was not sufficiently mar the scene of the outrage. Por various reasons urged by the local officers, any further public apology was not considered advisable; as the outcome of the Constant murder, the headquarters of the 2nd Rajputs were transferred to Bushire from Jask chiefly on the strength of the weighty grounds that, if we did not move in the matter of the promotion of the general safety of Europeans, some other Power would. The t'ersian Government and especially the Bakhtiari element, in the month of March, made much of crushing defeiis inflicted by the Amir Mujahid on the Buwair Ahmadi tribes. The report of H. M's. Vice-Consul for Ahwaz {infra) shows clearly the exact value that should be attributed to these dis astrous Bakhtiari attempts to restoie order and punish disturbe s of tlie peace.16 PERSIAN (Htt/P ADMINISTRATION REPORT In short, the Eesidency records of the year have been searched in vain for the smallest indication of any reparation that has been made for the death of a gallant and distinguished British Officer. In January His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, urged the withdrawal of the 39th Withdrawal of the Central India Horse and Central India Horse in the early spring Rajput detachment from Shiraz. on the ground that they were practicallv useless for the escort of caravans on such a road as that from Bushire to Shiraz which was the object with which they had originally been despatched and that, while no blame whatever would be attached to the officers and men whose conduct, under most trying circumstances, had been beyond praise throughout, their presence at Shiraz had led to a number of minor incidents culminating in the death of Captain Eckford. His Majesty's Minister eventually decided that the question of with drawal was one in which political considerations were far outweighed by military ones and advised that the Officer Commanding the Eegiment should submit the proposal for the opinion of the Military authorities of the Government of India. The proposal to withdraw the regiment was approved. Warnings by the Govern or-General of Ears and the Governor of the Gulf Ports were addressed simultaneously to the headmen on the Bushire-Shiraz road They explained that there could be no doubt of the policy of forebearance and friendliness followed by the British Government towards Persia in spite of several attacks on British subjects and the losses suffered by their traders from robberies and illegal exactions; and they pointed to the decision to withdraw the British troops at Shiraz as a signal illustration of British friendship. A question arose at the same time if whether the infantry detachment sent up in 1911 should be withdrawn with the cavalry ; it was finally decided that it should be withdrawn and would not be relieved. Pinal orders on the subject issued from the Poreign Office on 7th March, and Colonel Douglas decided to move in the first week in April. They eventually left Shiraz on the 5th and arrived at Bushire on the 16th April without incident. The headmen on the road proved friendly and Colonel Douglas informed the Hesident that the regiment was shown every civility and attention by the headmen of Daliki, Borasjun and Ahmadi. On the same day Sir E. Grey asked His Majesty's Minister to instruct Sir P. Cox to 'ex press to Colonel Douglas and the regiment under his command ' my sincere congratulations on the termination of their most arduous duty. I much appreciate the tact and self-restraint shown by the regiment in trying cir cumstances during 18 months in Persia.' In the end of January, the Kawam-ul-Mulk visited His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, and pointed out that the Governor- Expeditions of the Kawam-ul-Mulk. General's new force was making slow progress and that the spring season, when the tribes would again be on the move, was drawing near and that it was essential to make an example of at least one section from each tribe, e g ■&gt; the Baharlus from among the Khamseh and the Kashkulis from among the Kashgais. Asked how he proposed to effect this chastisement, the Kawam -ul-Mulk replied that, if he were given 30,000 tomans and 100,000 cartridges, he would undertake to chastise the Baharlus. The Consul deprecated the idea of the Kawam-ul-Mulk being again given public money to play, with but he and the Governor-General agreed that it would be to the public advantage if the Kawam-ul-Mulk could leave Shiraz in some way or other. His Majesty's Minister, in commenting on the above, agreed that it would be most unwise to entrust the Kawam with public money in order to allow him to advertise—what was probably the fact—-that he was more powerful in .1 ars than the Governor-General himself, and expressed a hope that he woulu be able to induce the Central authorities at Tehran to obtain a Governorship for h im or, failing that, to try and get him to Europe.POE THE TEAR 1913. 17 Sir E. Grey agreed and directed that His Majesty's Consul should be ins tructed to discourage independent action by the Kawam-ul-Mulk and impress on him the necessity for loyal assistance to the Governor-General. No hope of obtaining money should be held out to him. Nevertheless by the 8th March we find the Kawam-ul-Mulk still at Shiraz and the Govern or-General proposing to employ him in the task of maintaining order during the coming tribal spring migration. He is to enlist 300 horsemen and about 400 riflemen to be paid by the finance Agent from savings on his budget. A financial agent is to accompany the force and control expenditure. The Kawam-ul-Mulk is to go to Easa and the other eastern districts where he will be in a position to restrain the Baharlus and Arabs and collect some revenue. On the 6th April he started. The tribal migration passed off quietly; there was no disturbance of any kind and more confidence and tranquillity prevailed than had been the case during the tribal migration for some years. In early May the Kawam-ul-Mulk with a force of 7,000 to 8,000 Arabs was reported to have advanced to near Darab. Some sections of Baharlus had sub mitted, but the majority of the Chieis had fled, and the Kawam-ul-Mulk had sent 850 horsemen in pursuit. The expedition experienced some difficulty owing to scarcity of forage and ravages of locusts in the Fasa district. In early June we find Asghar Khan, brother of Muhammad Kuli Khan of the Shebani Arabs, a prisioner in the Kawam's hand. The Kawam is about to return to Shiraz and the problem of 44 what to do with this too powerful subject' is exercising the minds of the Ears authorities. A fortnight later, the Kawam is in Mervdasht and Muhammad Kuli Khan, who has just suc cessfully evaded the gendarmerie, surrenders to him. The Governor-General hangs Asghar Khan, and Muhammad Kuli Khan is executed by the Kawam. These freebooters had for some years past been one of the chief causes of dis turbances in Ears and had organised Arab depredations which had occasioned serious loss to private individuals and to the State. During the expedition, another firebrand also disappeared in the person of Shaikh Zakarieh, who was murdered by his own people. This brigand was responsible for many of the raids into Kerman from the lawless south Eastern districts of Ears. Thus three of the most turbulent factors of the disturbed situation were removed from the scene and the Kawam-ul-Mulk's prestige was greatly increased. The expedition was described in the following terms by His Majesty's Minister in a Despatch to the Secretary of State Its object was ' to punish certain Khamsjh tribes, more especially the Baharlus, who frequent the South eastern and Eastern districts of the province. It would appear that this ex pedition has met with no small measure of success, and has retrieved a dis aster to Government arms that took place near Darab some 4 years ago, since which time all semblance of Government authority over the district had dis appeared. There is, of course, a danger that Kawam-ul-Mulk, when he returns as a conqueror, may become a more dangerous factor than before.' The Kawam-ul-Mulk eventually returned to Shiraz on the night of the 3rd August. He did not, however, stay long as, on the 24th September, His Majesty's Consul reports that the Einance Agent has completed an arrange ment with Kawam who undertakes the Governorship of Lari&amp;tan, Sabeh Juyin Bidchahi, Sabeh Rudaneh Ahmadi Easa and the Khamseh tribes. The annual revenue for these districts is 2,07,765 tomans The Kawam was accorded a reduction of 73,000 tomans for this year and 53,000 for next, and responsible for all expenses, taking over and conducting the administration. On several occasions between his return to Shiraz and October, his name was put forward as a possible Governor according as the position of Mukhbir- es-Sultaneh appeared, from time to time, impossible to sustain. On the last occasion it was suggested that u if the change is made, the initial appointment should, of course, come from the Persian Government, but His Majesty's Government would be prepared to assure him, if appointed, that so long as he co-operated loyally with the Central Government, he could count on the diplo matic support of His Majesty's Legation at Tehran and His Majesty's Consu late locally at Ears.'18 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Simultaneously with this proposal, however, the Kawam, furious at the conduct of the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh Avhich will be touclu d on elsewhere, pointed put that the latter's proceedings must produce the woist possible effect amon? the Arab and other Chiefs whom Kawam had iccently reduced to order # Sowlet-ed-Dowleh was i&lt;ot checked, he could probably succeed in makino- the Kawam's task as Governor uf i^aristan, etc., impossible, and he talked of resigning. On the 8th November, the Kawam's departure was reported from Shiraz on an expedition into Laristan, etc., from which he had not returned by the end of the year. Last year's report showed that the Governor-General had reappointed the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. ^ ^ k ' lanistli P Of the E.ashgai at the close of the year. On the 13th April, His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, wired to His Majesty's Minister the result of a long conversation with the Jlkhani. His Majesty's Consul noticed that his general attitude v as that of profound distrust of the Persian Government and impressed on him that his two principal duties were— (1) loyalty to the Persian Government and its representative in Ears and (2) maintenance of order amsng the Kashgais. Sowlet-ed-Dowleh declared that he was able to produce the principal offenders in the attacks on our troops but wou 1 d only surrender them to His Majesty's Consul as a proof of his good-will towards the British Government. His Majesty's Corsul explained that he had no aut'hority to accept such a condition. Sowlet was manifestly disappointed. However, he promised to give full support to the gendarmerie. In May it was rumoured that a reconciliation had been effected between the Kawam-ul-Mulk and the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. This was characterised by His Majesty's Minister as a truce that will presumably last only as long as it is in their mutual interests it should continue to do so, or, in oiher words, as long as the Governor-General by virtue of his own personality or of the open sup port of the Central GovernmeLt and HisiMajesty's Legation, is recognised as the mod; important factor in the province.' In October, however, His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz reported telegraphi cally to His Majesty's Minister, the following resume of Kashgai affairs :— 'For some months past discontent of Kashgais against Sowlet has been steadily increasing. He had trouble with tribe in Spring which he only overcame with difficulty by patching up truce between rival parties and by accepting Muhammad All Khan as dominating personality amongst tribal Kalantars. Since then he has steadily persecuted Kalantars who fought against him on side of Government during 1912. This persecution has culminated lately in his arresting families of Ali Pinah Kikha, principal Kalantar of Parashuri clan, and others. This has driven Kalantars to desperation and they or rheir representatives have assembled in city to lay case before Governor-General. Deputation of them headed by Sowlet-es-Sultaneh visited me yesterday includ ing Muhammad Khan, Kashkuli, Ali Pinah Kikha, Darashuri, and number of other men well known and influential in tribe. They demand Soviet 's dismissal and threaten serious tribal difficulties if Ilkhani is not changed. t£ It is essential that some proper understanding should be come to with Sowlet. Three principal questions present difficulties. 'First. Disagreement with Kalantars referred to above. 'Second, Question of Muhammad Ali Khan and other rascals at present enjoying Sowlet's protection. I will refer to this matter again lower down. 'Third. Sowlet has prohibited export to Shiraz of grain from his pro perties in the south, and very serious consequences are thereby threatened. Governor -General has therefore summoned Sowlet to meet him in conference in Shiraz when it may be hoped satisfactory arrangement in all these points may be arrived at. Sowlot is suspicious and fears to come and Stas and a are doing our best to induce him to do so, and Stas will give him personal guarantee of safety. If the Sowlet comes in and arranges matters satislactoulyfor the tear 1913. 19 with. Governor, well and good. If not, events must take their course and, in my opinion and that of Governor, his deposition will be ioevitable. Should latter alternative occur, it would be desirable that force of gendarmerie now on road between here and Kazerun should be strengthened by few hundred men simply as military precaution. No other step would be required from them, and there would, in my opinion, be no fighting.' ' Only influential Kalantars on Sowlet's side are Muhammad Ali Khan Kashkuli, Ayyaz Klkha, Darashuri, and there is litcle doubt that both would desert him imme liately it* he were deposed. ^ Indeed I hear that already his few remaining adherents are leaving him in anticipation of this event. Meanwhile cmducfc of Muhamma I Ali Khan is greater scandal than ever! Your Excellency is already acquainted with our causes of complaint against him. Since my arrival hce he and his men have been concerned in numerous cases of highway robbery round about Shahpur, etc. He has now attained such an influential position that he has made himself practically master of large areas north and north-west of Shiraz. I have recently received detailed reports of his proceedings from reliable eye witnesses. He is building series of forts in neighbourhood of Ardakhan and terroiises whole country in that direction. ^ I have seen letter written by him to friend in Shiraz announcing his intention of opposing any Governor of Mamasanni country sent from Shiraz, and it is known that he intends to make himself master of that dis trict also. There are many other grounds of complaint against them with which I will not trouVe you now. Man, in fact, is public nuisance, and his suppression sooner or later is inevitable. As to replacement of Sowlet, there is strong general feeling now that time has come for removing Ilkhaniship from that family None of members can really control tribe. Governor's idea is that Ilkhaniship should be made Government appointment and that Ilkhani should govern trihe through medium of Kalantars. In this I entirely agree. In event of present Ilkhani being changed now, Ilkhaniship could be vested as temporary measure on Sowiet-es-Suitaneh who is Ilbegi, while question of future gn ernmeat of tribe was being discussed at Tehran ' The removal of Sowlet was not favourably regarded by the Central authorities at Tehran, and an attempt was made by the Ears authorities to induce him to come to Shiraz, so that a temporary settlement could be patched up between the Ilkhani and his tribal Kalantars. His Majesty's Minister was of the opinion that the deposition of Sowlet-ed- Ibwleh would be calculated to engender discord and disorder, while Colonel Hjalmarson, of the gendarmerie 'deprecated very strongly the use of the geadarmes for the purpose of compassing the overthrow of Sowlet for two reasons; firstly because Sowlet was the one man in Ears who had rendered the gendarmerie corlial assistance, and had enabled them to take possession of a portion of the road, and assist in the suppression of the extortion of illegal road taxes, and that he felt it would now be a treacherous act that might be quoted elsewhere adversely against the gendarmerie, were his men to operate against him, secondly, he thous'ht that it would be a mistake to get the gendarmerie mixed up in an affair which might develop into action against a powerful tribe.' In November, His Majesty's Consul reported to His Majesty's Minister that the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh had never been an entirely satisfactory Ilkhani. ' Apart from his various adventures and shortcomings in the past, his attitude towards the present Governor-General has been characterised by unceasing suspicion and lack of candour. One of the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh's first administrative acts on taking charge of the province was to reappoint the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh as Ilkhani of the Kashgais, and he has ever since endeavoured to maintain friendly relations with him, and to inspire him with confidence. It is quite comprehensible that the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh should entertain a deep distrust of all Persian officials and their ways : but this is carried to an absurd extent when the Ilkhani, even when guaranteed his personal safety by the British Consul and the Belgian Pinance Agent, refuses to come into Shiraz to meet the Governor-General in a friendly conference.' The Sowlet, however, continued to hold the position of Ilkhani of the Kashgais to the end of the year. d-220 PEESIAN GULr ADMINISTRATION REPORT In bidding farewell for the moment to the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, it i 8 interesting to note that, in June, Herr Wassmuss, the German Consul, Bushire proceeded to Shiraz whence he did not return until 1st November. On the 26th September, His Majesty's Consul reported that the German Consul returned from a tour to Persepolis via Baiza, where most Kashgais were then assembled and spent the night with Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. The meeting waa ' accidental and quite a surprise' to the German Consul. The latter was evidently very busy collecting all possible information regarding the affairs of Fars. His activity, considered in conjunction with the visit of two German Military Attaches in the spring, under the auspices of the gendarmerie, seems significant of Germany's interest in Fars. Last year's report shows that this measure surmounted the ' sanction' Proviflion of funds by His Majesty's Govern- sfcage,^ but had not actually been put into 1 menfc for the needs of the Fars Administration. practice. £10,000 had been expended and £15,000 had been earmarked for Fars, and His Majesty's Minister was authorised to advance up to £6,000 per month from this sum, though no part of the £15,000 had actually been paid over. A beginning was, however, made with the new year when M. Stas, the new Finance Agent, arrived at Shiraz. At a meeting with the Governor-General of Fars, M. Stas was obliged to point out that, although, by the judicious expenditure of £15,000 the Governor-General would be able to carry on his administration until the end of the current financial year or about the beginning of March, and would also be able to lay the foundation for a small mobile force and a system of road guards, he would then find himself once more penniless at least 4 months before it would be possible for him to collect any considerable sum in the form of revenue. The normal monthly expenditure of the province (gendarmerie excluded) amounted to about tomans 40,000. In favourable circumstances, the Financial Agent] believed that tomans 450,000 could be raised as revenue during the next financial year. He, therefore, represented that funds should be advanced for the first 4, or preferably, 6 months of the year, and estimated his requirements at from Tomans 160—240,000. His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, in reporting these estimates to His Majesty's Minister suggested that a sum of £40,000 to £50,000 should bo lent on the security of the revenues of Fars under the same conditions of security and control as were imposed in the case of the £15,000. His Majesty's Minister replied that £30,000 should suffice and trusted that M. Stas' estimates of expenditure, which appeared high, could be reduced. On the 8th March, His Majesty's Minister informed His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, that the negotiations for an advance of £400,000 were well advanced and that he had instructions to make the condition that not less than £30,000 were to be earmarked for the needs of the administration of Fars. The financial administration of the province has apparently been moderately successful in spite of occasional restiveness on the part of the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh. It will be remembered that, in last year's report, was recorded a proposal Formation of a force for the Governor-General by His Majesty's Consul that a regular of Far8 - force, say 1,500 strong, should be gradually raised by British officers. It was considered that Swedes were destitute of the necessary qualifications. There was some controversy on the question of whether Swedes should be employed as advisers to the new force and the attitude of the gendarmerie towards it was perhaps illustrated by their refusal to permit any of the new arms, ordered for the gendarmerie, to be handed over to the Governor-General's force; the Swedes were, however, prepared, as a proof of their readiness to assist the Governor-General to allow them the antiquated weapons with which the gendarmes were then (in January) armed. These rifles were described by His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz as 300 old rifles of very inferior quality. This offer was coupled with the condition that the Fars administration would help in the cost of transport of the new rifles then at Bushire to Shiraz. Even this arrangement, however, fell through, as the gendarmes were not prepared to risk bringing up the new rifles for some tune,FOR THE TEAR 1913. 21 and it was next proposed that the Governor-General's force should receive its arms from India His Majesty's Minister wired to the Foreign OHRce asking that 1,000 rifles and 500 rounds per rifle might be supplied by the Government of India. Some ammunition was left at ^hiraz by the Central India Horse at the Governor-General's disposal and the 1,000 rifles together with the necessary ammunition to complete the proportion of 500 rounds per rifle reached Bushire in April. Seven hundred rifles and 150,000 rounds were however later diverted to Sistan for'the use of the Governor there. The 300 remaining rifles and some of the ammu nition were utilised by the forces lent by Shiraz to the Gulf Ports admini stration for the control of Dashti and Dashtistan. Colonel Merrill considered the rifles unsuitable for the force he was proposing to raise and the question of arming the Shiraz forces has not yet been definitely disposed of. In the middle of February, Shiraz submitted its proposals for the new force. Pive hundred sowars were to be maintained and the following measures were urgent:— # (1) Engagement of European officers for the supervision of troops and military arrangements generally. (2) Arms and ammunition to be provided for the Governor-General's new force. In the end of February, the Governme it of India put forward the suggestion that the proposed military force of tbe Governor-General of Fars, oa the success of which not oaly the success of the gendarmerie but the peace and order of the province, collection of revenue and the repayment of the loan depended, should be placed under British officers, in order to ensure to our traders safety and increase of trade. His Majesty's Government, however decided against this proposal. In March, first appears the suggestion that a compromise on the vexed question of British officers versus Swedes could perhaps be found by employing Merrill, an American officer. Colonel Hjalmarson objected to Merrill as a hopeless administrator, quite incapable of keeping accounts. In December 1913, His Majesty's Minister had to report that the general complaint against the Swedes was that they could not submit their accounts and that 0 their methods were extravagant. In February, Sir Edward Grey solved the controversy by seeing no objection to the employment of Colonel Merrill, and directed that £30,000 should be earmarked the general loan for the purposes of Fars administra tion. The first definite request for Merrills services appears to have been made by the Governor -General in the month of June, but it was not until October that it was definitely decided that he was to go to Shiraz at once to organise a military force for the Governor-General. He was to co-operate closely with the Swedes and to arrive at a complete understanding with the Governor-General under whose orders he was directly placed. Major O'Connor was of the opinion that it was important that before Merrill left Tehran, a definite understanding should be arrived at between him and the'Treasurer-Genera 1 as to the fixed minimum sum he could be supplied with monthly for the purpose of the organisation of a suitable force. 20—25,000 tomans monthly were in His Majesty's Consul's opinion requiied. Colonel Merrill was to draw up a budget under the advice of the Finance Agent, and the latter should receive instructions to furnish Merrill with the necessary funds subject to usual financial control. Colonel Merrill must be permitted, Major O'Connor continued, a free hand in reorganising local troops. The present rabble would have to be disbanded and dismissed. These were the indispensable preliminaries towards the success of Merrill's task. The formation of the force was thus, at the close of 1913, in its initial stages, and it is difficult to make any forecast as to its future, though its success will go far to solve a well-nigh impossible problem.22 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Very early in the year it was armounoei that His Majesty's Government had decided to make an advance of Swedish Gendarmerie. £100,000 for the Ears Gendarmerie. The Ala-us-Saltaneh, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, in assuring His Majesty's Minister of the desire of the Persian Government to re-establish ordar in the S ^uth, ganrantee the security of the trade routes and eventually punish those guilty ot! the attack on Mr. Consul Smart, in December 1911, of the murder of Captain Eckford, on the 11th December 1912, and of various other outrages, confess'd that the Persian Government had unfortunately no means to carry out a programme drawn up by Colonel Hjalmarson, the Swedish Colonel commanding the gendarmerie, which it was hoped would effect the objects of the Persian Government's desires, and therefore expressed a hope that His Majesty's Government might see fit to advance the money required for the purpose, namely, £350,000 under such guarantees as might be considered desirable that the money would be devoted to that and to no other purpose. It would not be necessary, ho said, for the whole sum to be advanced at once, but it was essential, for the satisfactory execution of the scheme, that the Persian Government could rest assured that the money would be forthcoming when wanted. Colonel Hjalmarson's scheme provided for a corps of 1,800 men to cover the route from Bushire to Yazd-i-Khast, of which 1 3 000 men should be at headquarters which were fixed at Shiraz. On the 13th February, the Swedish Colonel submitted to the Minister the Interior an amended programme whioh involved for the two years a total expenditure of £26^,000 for the guarding of the section of the southern road which extends from Yazd-i-Khast to Bushire. Major Brandel arrived, it will be remembered, at Bushire at the close of 1912 and, at the time of the Constant murder, had some 200 men enlisted from the districts around Bushire. Very shortly after the Constant murder he was left with 30 or 10 men who originally came down with him from the north. 168 genlarmes, mostly Taugistanis, had resigned in a body, because two recruits ha 1 bean stripped naked and flogged for some offence. For the force, the arms and ammunition, made in Germany, were lying at Bushire awaiting despatch to Shiraz very early in the year. They arrived, there on the 5th May in safety. The safe arrival of these arms was the result of a fine piece of work, watched with much anxiety by all concerned and would have been more creditable if some rather dubious negotiations with the powerful Khans on the road, by which the latter were led to believe that the gendarmerie would connive at the levy of their illegal exactions, called Jiahdari, on trade, had not proved a powerful lever to secure the quiet passage of the arms in question. On February 27th, the first detachment of the gendarmerie, '450 strong, left Tehran for Shiraz ; Colonel Hjalmarson followed with the French Minister on the 11th March. They arrived without incident on the 31st March. A further detachment, 600 strong, left Tehran on the 23rd April. On the 17th April, Major Brandel sent some letters to the Kban of Ahmedi, proposing that he should co-operate in a raid on the Khan of Borasjun with whom Ahmedi was not on friendly terms. He planned all this, just at the lime that the arms caravan was about to proceed up the road, presumably by way of smoothing the way for the venture, as if the gendarmerie had not already enough on their hands. No one in authority at Bushire was consulted. The head tufangchi of the Customs wrote the letters without the knowledge of his own Customs Director and, if the letters had not secretly come to the knowledge of Sir Percy Cox, who discussed the situation frankly with Major Brandel, a difficult task might well have been rendered impossible by an irresponsible side show of this kind. Some mention has been made of the Muhammad Kuli Khan episode when we were tracing the career of the Kawam-ul-Mulk throughout the year under report It was mentioned that Muhammad Kuli Khan successfully evaded the gendarmerie. This was perhaps rather a euphemistic way of putting it. , Excel 1 ency the Governor-General of Fars, after consultation with MajorsFOU THE YEAR 1913. 3 3 O'Connor and ?iefyert had arranged that a detachment of gendarmes, then on its way to Shiraz should halt at Sivend until they were joined bv Maior Siefvett with a smaller force from Shiraz. The combined force was to attack the Shahham Arabs under Muhammad Kuli Khan and kill or capture their leader The movement was duly carried out, ana it was reported at flist with rjerfeot success, several villages hemg restored to their rightful owners an'l much stolen booty recovered Later advices showed that, though the success had been general, less stolen property had been recovered than' was st&amp;ted at fl , . and Muhammad Kuh Khan had not been captured. Then ngly stories bean to be whispered about that the gendarmes had looted and ravished like anv Bakhtian;, and tnat Siefyert himself haa accepted horses ai.d carpets from Muhammad Kuli Khan, who promised to murend-r at Shiraz within 3 davs a promise which he was, of course, caieful not to fulfil. ' ' Siefvert then returned to Shiraz and, on Muhammad Kuli Khan not putting in an appearance, a second Swedish officer was sent out to complete his task. This second effort ended also in failure; Muhammad Kuli Khan was allowe d to escape with all his family, although the Swedes had 500 men ti put against him. To crown the misfortunes, Kawam-ul-Mulk appeared upon the scene a few days after the gendNrmes had been withdrawn attacked, captured and hanged the Shahbani Chief in 24 hours. Tin Swedish officers deny that there is the smallest foundation for the accusation of looting made against the gendarmes ' but the truthful historian wil] have to record harder things about them in relation to Kazerun, wlen the events of the year 1914 have to be reviewed in their turn. A Swedish officer naivel-/ remarked to a British confrere the other day in Bushire 44 I must believe what my own men say . If that is the spirit in which they are going to conduct enquiries, no one but a Swede will believe what a Swede says. ihe difference between the Swedes and the Governor-General reached their climax in September when, on the night of the 10th September, a Saiyid was killed by a negro gendarme. The latter was arrested by the police and confined in the ark. Next morning an enquiry was held in the Adliyeh and the man was condemned to death. Captain Lundberg visited the Governor-General at noon and asked that no execution should take place until Colonel Uggla had had an opportunity of discussing the case with the Governor. The Governor agreed and Uggla arranged to visit him at 5-aO. p.m. In spite of this promise the Governor had the man executed in the afternoon and he was already dead when Uggla arrived. The same evening Captains Lundberg and KiFander marched a body of gendarmerie into the ark and Killander entered the Governor's presence with 8 armed native officers and demanded the corpse which was eventually handed over and was buried with full military honours on the 12th September. It appeared that the officers acted without instructions from Colonel Uggla who, on the IS^h, expressed his regret to the Governor-General for their action. This episode very nearly enaed in the dismissal of the Governor-General. In the summer it was found that the full scheme of policing the road from Shiraz to Bushire could not be cairied out as the gendarmes, men from the north, were unable to stand the execessive heat of the lower section of the road. The Governor-General therefore made an arrangement with certain headmen on the road south of Kazerun under which rahdari was to be abolished, in return for a monthly stipend paid to the Khan, and the enrolment of a certain number of his men as road guards The scheme entailed an expenditure of about £150 a month or rather less than it was estimated would have to be paid for similar services under a scheme drawn up by the gendarmerie. In the end of October, in spite of the unanimous objections of all responsible for the maintenance of order in the southern section of the Bushire to Shiraz road, including all the Bnshire authorities, a detachment of gendar merie 800 strong proceeded to occupy the southern section of the road. The intention was to reduce all subsidies as much as possible and eventually stop them altogether, . The Pvesident addressed remonstrances pointing out that the chiefs were being led to believe that these subsidies were permanent, whereas it was clear that the offer or payment of subsidies was merely a ruse designed to bring24 persian gttlf administration report about peaceful occupation of the Khan's buildings and that it was contemplate^ to cease payment directly possession had been gained. He protested against British officers being in any way associated with these oriental strategems. He urged that, before the gendarmerie came below the last Kotal, Major Uggla should coire on to Bushire and discuss matters with the Governor of the Gulf Ports, in whose jurisdiction the Khans resided, and with the Finance Agent and himself, the three persons in the best position to advise regarding this portion of the ro^d, who had a claim to be consulted. He also urged that any agreement come to with the Khans of Borasjun and Ahmadi should have the official cognizance and written endorsement of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The gendarmes arrived in due course and the main result of their presence, so far as regarded the lower section of the road, was to dislocate traffic by the wholesale impressing of mules for their service and to impose vexatious restrictions on the 'movement of caravans. That they are the best hated people in the Gulf Ports district was perhaps only to be expected and must not be laid to their charge. The following, with some slight verbal omissions and alterations, is taken from the report of His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, on the attempt of the gendarmerie to punish the notorious brigand, Ali Muhammad, Kamariji. &lt;c On the morning of the 15th a force of all arms, about 600 to 700 strong, with its five Swedish officers (Majors Uggla and Lundberg, and Captains Killander, Pousette and Lundberg), marched out towards Shapur district which lies to the north of the Bushire road extending from about the village cf Debris to the K ah jar Caravanserai, and bounded by the hills about five or six miles to the north. ' As far as concerned Muhammad Ali Khan no difficulty was experienced. Major Uggla sent an advance guard of cavalry to cut off his retreat in case he meditated any treachery, and himself proceeded directly to his fort of Eateh- abad. Here he was courteously received by Muhammad Ali Khan, who appeared to be in a wholesome siate of apprehension, and who agreed to quit the district with all his men, on the 17th, leaving only (by arrangement with Major Uggla) some 30 tufangchis to act as joint guards to various towers together with gendarmerie. ' Whilst these negotiations were in progress. Captain Pousette had advanced with a few men to the Tul-i-Kuhah fort (these various places will be found marked on sheet No. 10 0 of the degree sheets published by the Survey Department of India), occupied by Ali Muhammad and his band, and called upon him to surrender. On his refusing to do so, a force of all arms advanced against the fort, and at 2 p.m . began the attack upon it. These operations lasted until sunset and were continued during the night. As far as could he gathered from the accounts of the Swedish officers, the attack was well pressed forward, the two small 7 centimetre mountain guns advancing eventually to within 50 to 100 yards on the walls of the fort, and the gendarmes in general behaving very well and courageously. The brigands (estimated at about in number) kept themselves well hidden, and maintained a brisk and accurate fire on the attackers. ' The fort is an exceedingly strong one, standing on a small rise, built of solid stone, and with two tiers of fire. ' After nightfall (according to the accounts of the Swedish officers on the spot) the troops entirely surrounded the fort, and a storming party was . J 1 ! readiness to rush in as soon as a breach was effected. But just after midnig it was found that the fort had been quietly evacuated, and when the gendarmes rushed in there was no one there. It is impossible to understand how, excep through gross negligence on the part of the attackers, or the connivance o some of the gendarmes, the brigands effected their escape. It was a moonlight night, and a dog would have been plainly visible at 100 y a - r ., The ground immediately surrounding the fort is open. There were ^ our , Ag officers on the spot, and a sufficient force of gendarmes to surround the p a entirely. With ordinary vigilance and care not a man should have es ^ a f en alive. And yet Ali Muhammad, 50 men, 5 women, and some donkeys aFOR THE YEAR 1913. 25 with ammunition, etc , succeeded in getting away without anyone seeino- them or knowing in which direction they had gone. It was a most deplorable blunder, and has been the direct cause of all the subsequent troubles at and near Kazerun. ' The gendarmerie had no sooner taken over the road under the conditions just described when large numbers of them had to be concentrated again to repel an extraordinary situation that arose at Kazerun. After the main column of the gendarmeiie had moved down the road, the gendarmes at Kazerun proceeded to destroy towers and disarm villagers in the vicinity The villagers flocked into Kazerun and, on the 21st November, attacked the gendarmerie barracks about sunset. Ali Muhammad, KamarijL who as already reported, had effected his escape with his whole band and had been lurking in the neighbourhood, joined in the attack. About midnight 32 gandarmes evacuated the barracks and fled to the telegraph office, where, under the orders of the Assistant Superintendent, Shiraz, the telegraphist disarmed them so as to avoid an armed conflict in the telegraph office, A force of 400 to 500 men was despatched by Colonel Uggla to return to Kazerun at once The Darya Begi was despatched by the Governor-General from S iraz with a small force of 100 cavalry and 200 infantry to help in arranging the local situation and to support the gendarmerie in every possible way. In the mean time it was reported that Ali Muhammad Kamariji's tufangchis had killed a local Finance Agent near Dehris. After some sharp fighting on the 29fch, 30th November and 1st December, the gendarmerie eolumn entered Kazerun and restored order. Ali Muhammad, Kamariji, however again escaped, but his son-in-law was killed in the fighting. The tale of casulties was as follows :— Gandarmas 5 killed, 3 Persian officers and 23 men wounded. Enemy 29 corpses counted, wounded unknown. Three ringleaders were hanged. On the whole the gendarmerie are undoubtedly making their presence felt in the south. Their ultimate success is problematical. In the three immediately preceding articles mention has been made from FinSncial assistance given by His Majesty's ^i m ® to time of funds advanced and loans Government to Persia. proposed for SOuthem Persia, more especially Ears with which this report is immediately concerned. It will perhaps be interesting to trace the history of the conditions it was proposed from time to time to attach to the grant of this financial assistance and what they finally resulted in. The expedition planned to avenge Captain Eckford and restore order on the road had been vetoed and the Ala-us-Sultaneh, with an ingenuity that compels our admiration, had utilised the incident to borrow money from the long suffering British Government for a force officered by Swedes who were bent on introducing the commerce of their own country and making things easy for that of Germany and, incidentally, annoying, in so far as in them lay, our comrades of the Anglo-Eussian entente. The Political Eesident suggested desiderata which might be secured from the Persian Government in return for our forbearance. The list was a formidable one and is given below :— &lt;c l. Documentary recognition of our prescriptive rights to control light ing, buoying, and policing of Gulf in the same way that our position has been recognised in respect of quarantine, in regard to which the position might with advantage be reaffirmed inci dentally.' ' 2. Documentary recognition as a permanency of the old prescriptive postal rights and privileges which we still enjoy, and an expres sion of readiness to see those extended to other Persian ports of the Persian Gulf as occasion may require.' (&lt; 3. Undertaking to refrain from giving any lease or concession, com mercial or otherwise, in Southern and South-Western Persia (i. e., in the area comprising the British and neutral zones under the Anglo-Eussian Convention), or in Persian islands of the Gulf, to £26 PERSIAN GtTLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT any foreign subjects or Government, without the knowledge and consent of His Majesty's Government. We have precedent for such request in the undertaking given by the Shah to the Russian Minister referred to in Mr. Mailing's telegram of 27th August 1908, to the Foreign Office, repeated by me to India on the following day. This, peihaps, might be secured in the course of current negotiations for mining concession ' '4. Extension of rights of navigation to the Upper Karun. ,, ' 5. Abandonment of empty claims to sovereignty over Bahrain and recognition of our protective rights over those islands and Trucial Coast and our title to protect their subjects in Persia.'* ' 6. Undertaking to grant option to British Company when the time is ripe for the formation of lighterage company in Gulf Ports.' ' 7. Acceptance of Consular Officer at Bampur when needed. ,, Sir Percy Cox made no suggestion here in connection with the Kishm- Henjam position as we appeared to be effectively consolidating ourselves in an unobtrusive way and further openings were likely to offer themselves. On the 24th May the Government of India reduced these to the following:— (i) Documentary recognition of our prescriptive rights to buoy, light and police the Persian Gulf. (ii) Navigation rights on the Karun might be mentioned but were not pressing. (iii) Recognition of British Consular protection in Persia for Bahrainis and Trucial subjects. Persia should be pressed for an undertaking that she will lease or alienate no islands or part of an island in the Gulf to any other Foreign Power without our consent and that she will further leas^ to us, should occasion arise, such portions of the islands of Kishm, Henjam, Hormuz, Larak and Shaikh Shuaib as we may require in connection with the buoying, lighting and policing of the Gulf and for the convenience of His Majesty's ships em ployed in this connection. His Majesty's Minister was authorised to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty's Government were most anxious to assist them to restore order in Ears by means of the gendarmerie and were prepared to contribute to the financing of the administration, apart from their contribution to an advance on account of loan on the following conditions:— 1. Acceptance of our proposals as regards control over expenditure. 2. Gendarmerie budget to be drawn up by the Swedish Commanding Officer at Shiraz and agreed to by His Majesty's Consul and the financial agent in consultation, and when this is done, that all actual payments should be made by the Swedish Commander. 3. That the condition proposed by Sir Peroy Cox should if possible he ob tained as modified by His Excellency the Viceroy, All mention of the Karun, however, had better be omitted„ 4. That all purchases for the gendarmerie should be put up to open tender. 5. That proper security and interest can be arranged. On March 6th, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran reported to Sir E. Grey that there would be no difficulty in arranging that the purchases for' the gen darmerie should be put up to open tender, but that it would be very hard to secure the other conditions suggested by the British Consul -General at Bushire. He had urged an arrangement to enable a programme for the lighting and buoying of the Gulf, and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had agreed to urge the acceptance of this condition on the Cabinet but said that the right to (police Persian waters of the Gulf involved greater responsibility than his Government could assume. He also begged that the question as to BiitisnFOR THE TEAR 1913. 27 protection of the Bahrainis and subjects of the Trucial Chiefs might stand over. He asserted that Persia had no intention of alienating any islands in the Persian Gulf to any Foreign Power, either now or in the future, and he autho rised His Majesty's Minister to take official act of this statement which he said could be inserted in a written agreement. On the 8th March, the following amended conditions were imposed by Sir E. Grey in the following terms :— '1. Acceptance of our proposal respecting control over expenditure and respecting the tender systems for purchases.** « 2. A written arrangement respecting the lighting and buoying of the Gulf. We do not insist on mention in this of question of policino' territorial waters otherwise than for necessaiy protection of lights and buoys, provided that His Majesty's Minister had a verbal assurance that no question will be raised to our prescriptive rights in the Gulf geuerally.' 3. If we take note of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs' assu rance not to alienate any Persian islands in the Gulf to any Foreign Power it might be quoted hereafter as an admission on our part of Persian rights in Bahrain.' 'It should, therefore, be made clear that His Majesty's Government main tain their attitude in regard to the protection of Bahrainis and Trucial subjects and, in refraining from pressing their request for Per-ian recognition of this claim, do so only on the understanding that their rights will not be disputed in practice.*' Finally on April 7th the following instructions were sent:— 4&lt; As regards lighting and buoyage of Persian Gulf, His Majesty's Government consider that, unless there was reason to think that the Persian Government would now accept proposed stipulation as regards formal agreement in terms set forth in the 2nd clause above, the best course would be to withdraw it altogether. When informing the Persian Government that it was withdrawn, His Majesty's Minister was to add that His Majesty's Government regard themselves as possessing a prescriptive right to the control of the lighting arrangements in the Gulf, which, if occasion arose, they would not hesitate to enforce.' The final conditions of the loan were set forth in aide memoires exchanged between His Majesty's Minister and the Vosuk-ud-Dowleh. In either case, the concluding paragraphs, as concerning matters in which this Eesidency has a vital interest may perhaps be quoted in extenso. The Minister's note concludes as follows :— ' His Majesty's Government had hoped that, in view of the benevolent attitude adopted towards Persia in the matter of the disorders on the southern trade routes, which have led to assaults upon British officials and seriously affected British trade and of the readiness displayed to assist Persia financially, the Imperial Government would have been disposed to come to a definite understanding with the British Government, concerning certain questions connected with tie Persian Gulf, such as the buoyage and light ing; and the recognition of the right of British Consular Officers to protect certain persons.** ' Seeing, however, that the Persian Government are reluctant to under take the responsibility of making a satisfactory written arrange ment upon the subject, His Majesty*s Government have decided to withdraw the demands which were put forward as a condition of the advance of £100,000 on behalf of the gendarmerie of Fars; but in doing so they wish it to be understood that they regard themselves as possessing a prescriptive right to control the lighting and buoyage arrangements in the Gulf, which, if occasion arose, they would not hesitate to enforce.** e228 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT 'His Majesty's Government also wish it to be made clear that they maintain their attitude respecting the right of British Consular Officers to extend protection in Persia to the subjects of Bahrain and Trucial Chiefs, and that, in refraining from pressing their request for Persian recognition of this claim, they do so only on the understanding that their rights will not be disputed in practice. The aide memoire furnished by the Vosuk-ud-Dowleh to His Majesty 's Minister states :— ***** but with regard to the concluding passages in the memorandum re the buoyage and lighthouses and the recognition of the riffht of British Consular Officers to protect certain classes of persons the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to refer ilis Britannic Majesty's Minister to the proposals made to him on the evening of the 11th March by His Excellency the Mushaver-ul- Mamalik, Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, respecting the erection of lighthouses and to previous correspondence between the Persian Foreign Office and the British Legation on the Bahrain question. It is to be added that the Persian Foreign Office maintains its former views in the case alluded to, and all similar cases.' , The latest information on the subject of the gendarmerie and their cost is perhaps rather beyond the purview of this report, but it was understood, in May, that the gendarmerie were going to cost £400,000 per annum. For one year from that date sufficient for the day was the evil thereof. The day is past and over at the time of writing this report, and it is quite an interesting object of peculation as to what is going to happen next. This term is frequently used in official correspondence and the Resident Policing of the Persian Gulf» defined. ^ as .' in the end of February, asked by His Majesty s Minister to explain exactly what was meant by it. In reply the Eesident telegraphed as follows :— ' Policing ' may be said to comprise ' the maintenance of measures and the performance of duties necessary for the preservation of the Maritime Truce.' t( These duties are chiefly exercised in the suppression of piracy, the slave trade, and traffic in arms; in maintaining order amongst boats engaged in the pearl fishery and the protection of dhows employed in the exportation of dates from the Shatt-el-Arab and its vicinity ; also in the prevention of breaches of the Maritime Truce by the passage by sea of armed dhows in connection with inter-tribal warfare on land.' ' When necessity arises these duties carry us into territorial waters^ and even to terra firma. Vis-a-vis the Persian Government we have already claimed to exercise our discretion in this direction and on repeated occasions have given effect to it/' &lt;c The right is thus one which is habitually exercised by us with or with out the previous concurrence of the Persian Government, but without disregarding Persian sovereignty unnecessarily, and our ^requirement at the present moment is merely specific and general recognition by Persia, as one of the maritime powers of the Gulf, of this right, with a view to consolidating our juridical position in regard thereto vis-a-vis outside Powers.' The Besident pointed out that in the course of current negotiations with the we had made a similar demand. In ^Aprll, ilic Government of India accepted the Besident's definition of the duties implied in the term policing ' the Persian Gulf.FOR THE YEAR 1918. 29 These tribesmen with the Mamasannis and Muhammad Ali Khan, Kash- Buwair Ahmadis. kuli, figure in last year's report' as the perpetrators of the &lt;£ Eckford' , outrage. In the course of the present year, they or at least a portion of the tribe, came into contact with the Residency in a rather curious fashion and the fact seems worthy of record. The tribe are divided into dwellers in the hot country (Garmsiri) and dwellers in the mountains (Sarhadi). It is the first division or rather their chiefs who came into contact with the Residency, while it is the latter to whom the murder of Captain Eckford has been attributed. On the 14th January, the Resident reported to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran that deposits of money, amounting to roughly 15,000 tomans the property of certain Buwair Ahmadi Chiefs were in Bushire, partly with the Imperial Bank of Persia and partly with the British naval contractor. Nego tiations for the withdrawal of these deposits were then in progress. The Resi dent invited His Majesty's Minister to consider, in consultation with the Tehran Bank^ Manager, the expediency of asking the Persian Government to request the British authorities at Bushire to withhold payment of these deposits, as it was conceivable that the payees were concerned in the murder of Captain Eckford. The Minister did not, however, consider himself justified in taking this step which might be regarded by the Bank's clients as a breach of confidence, more especially as it was beginning to be thought at Tehran that the Kughelu, rather than the Buwair Ahmadi, were responsible for the outrage of December 11th, 1912. Uncertainty as to whom actually the money should be paid and quarrels among the heirs of the original depositor delayed payment of this money which was still in deposit at the close of 1913. This Chief does not figure largely in the records of the year. In late Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuii. October, Colonel XJggla informed His Majesty s Consul, Shiraz, that he had offer ed to vacate Shapur so that it might be restored to its proper owners on the condition that the surrender is effected in the presence of a gendarmerie force. How the Shapur valley was evacuated by Muhammad Ali Khan has already been related in the close of the article on the ' Gendarmerie ' One of the results of the Kawam's expedition of April and May 1913, Proposed sale of villages in the neighbour- ^^-S the Confiscation to the Stute Of certain hood of Mervdasht and Kafrak to satisfy British villages in the neighbourhood of Mervdasht clal ™ s • and Kafrak. His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, suggested that the sale of these villages would suffice to pay off a large portion of the British claims for losses suffered in the province of Ears which amounted to about £20,000, and that the Persian Government should be moved to authorise this sale for the purpose or at least to earmark the annual revenue towards the gradual liquidation of the British claims. His Majesty's Minister supported this proposal, but Sir E. Grey found that there were a variety of objections to such a course, for instance, other British claimants might resent the preferential treatment accorded and other powers might be tempted to urge the Persian Government to send a military expedition for the settlement of their claims. Sir E. Grey preferred that funds from the sale or revenue of the villages should be earmarked for the upkeep of the gendarmerie in Pars or for otherwise strengthening the local administration. A further submission of the views of His Majesty's Consul was requested and he suggested that the sums recovered should be divided proportionately amongst claimants of all nations for losses incurred in Ears. This proposal eventually received a rather qualified approval from His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs, in November, but no claims were actually settled before the end of the year. A special article has been devoted to the ' Constant ' outrage which, after » „ , , , all, may fairly be taken to have been an aS 0 Busl ' re and the surr0 ' ndiDg isolated act of revenge of no special significance by a dismissed employe ; others follow dealing with the Tangistani operations and Bakhtiari aggressions against the Lirawi tract. Eor the rest, there is little to remark.80 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT. Under the heading ' Kalantar and Kadhuda ' of last year's report, some mention is made of disturbances by Tangistani sympathisers of the Ka'lanta Mashadi Abdul Rasul. There was a slight recrudescence of these disorders i*' the month of April when Zair Khadhar, the headman of Tangistan, besieged Chogodak a village under the Khan of Ahmadi. A threat was made to send the Eajputs to clear out the aggressors but, before the need for any actiye steps arose, Zair Kbadhar was repelled and left for Ahram in his own country The Administration Report for 1911 gives, under the heading ' Trucial OferaiiOBB against Tangistanls. ' an aCC0U « t 0f ^ent that led to these operations. It is sufficient to say here that they were undertaken to exact compensation for a piratical outrage committed by these tribesmen on a Bibai pearling boat. All efforts to induce the Persian Government or the subordinate authorities of Fars to take action had failed, and, in April, Sir Percy Cox advised the seizure of native craft belonging to Txngistan. Arrangements were made with Haidar Khan Hayat Davudi, Dhabit of Hayat Davudi and Bandar Rig, for the detention of the captured dhows at the island of Kharag pending payment of comnensaHnn and the surrender of the culprits. On the 9th June, a telegram was sent by the Resident to His Excellency the Governor-General of Fars informing him of the action it was proposed to take. The Centra] Authorities at Tehran were at the same time apprised by His Majesty's Minister of the decision of His Majesty's Government based on Sir Percy Cox's proposals On June 14th, the village of Madumari was bombarded and, on the next day, after a preliminary bombardment, every available man was landed. One able seaman was killed and five were woundea, two only slightly, by sniping from the shore. The dhows were found hauled a considerable distance up the creek and fifteen were either blown up with guncotton or burnt. His Majesty's ships ' Pelorus, ' ' Philomel' and 14 Sphinx ' took part in this operation. On the 22nd June, the same ships, but this time with Lieutenant-Colonel Snrth and 200 men of the 2nd Queen Victoria's Own Rajput Light Infantry on board, commenced operations against the village of Dilwar, destroyed it and brought off four large dhows and one fishing dhow. Operations were also undertaken against the villages of Halileh, Rustami and Bulkhair on the 26th and 27th June. The nett result of these operations were, 24 dhows captured and searched of which 11 were held up to ransom, 10 were, after enquiry, released and three sunk, 17 dhows were destroyed. Madumari village was shelled and Hil^ar destroyed by the landing parties. The operations were eon- ducted by Commander P. Hill, R.N., Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf. The Resident expressed to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-nhief * a PP rec i a tion of the cordial manner in which Captain Hill co -operated with both the Officer Commanding 2nd Rajputs and the Resident, and of the eirective and judicious arrangements which he had made in spite of the double handicap of bad weather and heat. In his final report on the operations, the Resident brought to the favoura ble notice of the Government of India the services of Captain Hill, R.N., Senior Naval Officer, of the officers commanding H. M. S ' Philomel' and bphmx , of Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, Commanding the 2nd Queen V^toms Own Rajput Light Infantry and of his First Assistant, Captain L. .Biidwood, who acted as Political Officer to the combined forces. xt ^5 Allowing extracts are taken from the report of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to the Admiralty , . I co ^r that the small number of casualties is in a great measure due to the able dispositions made by Commander Peter W. E. Hill of H. M. B. ! 6 orus ^ as conducted these operations throughout with much skill and energy, and I have great pleasure in recommending him for some mark of tneir i ^ordsnips recognition. Commanders George N. Ballard, ' Philomel/' and orge J lodd, ' Sphinx,' who were in charge of the landing parties on dif- tftrent occasions, are also deserving of praise. The detachment of the 2nd (Queen 1C p 1 ^ s -Rajput Light Infantry under the command of Lieutenant-Colo- ne ij. a, omith also did excellent work, and I submit an expression of myFOR THE YEAR wis. 31 appreciation of the valuable co-operation rendered by them may be conveyed to the War Office. I sm also much indebted to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for the invaluable assistance and advice ^iven by the First Assistant Resident, laking into consideration the exceedir^ly tryino climatic conditions caused by the intense heat and rough sea experienced durino' the operations, it is great satisfaction to me to draw attention to the zeal^and gallantry displayed by all officers and men concerned.'* The Government of Ind f, while resetting that the operations should have resulted in loss of Me, considered that the ability and courage with which tbev were conducted reflected great credit on all concerned. They asked that an expression of their appreciation might be conveyed to Captain B rdwood, and congratulated Sir P. Oox on the general success of the operations, which thev considered largely to be due to the able manner in which he had planned and guided the expedition. The captu-ed dhows and their cargoes realised at public auction a sum of 85,000 in round numbers which was credited to Government. An expression of the gratitude of the Government of India was conveyed to Haidar Khan of Hayat Davud for his co-operation in the Ian din a- of British troops at Kharag Island. The favourable results that followed the operations were conspicuous dunng a tour made early in 1914 by Messrs. Chick, Commercial Adviser to the Eesident, and James, Chemical Expert of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company through Tangistan. The Tangistanis apparently bore no malice and enter tained their visitors most hospitably. Sir Percy Cox took occasion of these operations to request His Majesty's Minister at Tehran to point out to the Central authorities that, if only the repeated recommendations of the Governor and himself for the provision of a force or of funds to raise one had borne fruit, His Excellency would, after the operations, have been able to place a garrison of his own at the chief Tangistani port in co-operation with the Customs administration. He reported that His Excellency said that he could do so immediately, if he had authority or funds to entertain 200 men He- presentations in this sense were made by our Legation at Tehran, and as a result Dashti and Dashtistan were temporarily entrusted to the Governor of the Gulf Ports who was authorised to entertain a small force to keep the districts m order and recover Government revenue. Dashti and Dashtistan have not yet however been officially transferred. The Residency has, during the past year, watched with some anxiety the Bakhtiari aggression on Lirawi and Hayat Davud. methods adopted by the Bakhtiari Gover- „ nor of Behbehan, for administering his charge. The spoils of the Amir Mujahid are said to have been little less than 100 000 tomans in value, but the Central Government had not, so far as could be ascertained at the close of the year, received any of the past year's revenue due for Behbehan and the Kuhgelu from the Amir. These, however, are chiefly matters for the Central Government to attend to. Hie Amir Mujahid came immediately across the Residency sphere of influence when, bent on plunder, he turned his attention to the coast districts, commencing with Lirawi and the port of Dilam and demanded revenue for the past two years, as well as for the year 1913 Geographically, Lirawi is a purely littoral district situated between the province of Arabistan on the north and the district of Hayat Davud, under the vjovernor of the Gulf Ports on the south. Since 1840, it has remained annexed to the Behbehan Government, itself a sub-government of Ears. In 1887, its port, Dilam, was placed under the trovernorship of the Gulf Ports, just created. Before or about 1900, the istnct was granted by the Shah to Paji Saiyid Said-us-Sultaneh, a quondam uvernor of the Gulf Ports. He pays about 2,000 tomans per annum in Krm + ^ en ^ ra ^ Government and farms the district to the Khans for i U tomans per annum nett. This sum has been paid regularly by the ans, nnder the advice of their relative of Hayat Davud, to the Imperial vr n . Persia. Revenue had been paid up to March 1912 when the Amir i^Ujaind arrived ^ in Behbehan. Under the advice of the Shaikh of Moham- ran, the Lirawi Khans were induced to go and pay their respects to the32 PEESIAN GTJL]? ADMINISTRATION BEPORT Amir Mujahid who fleeced them and compelled them to give bonds for the payment of the revenue for the years 1911-1913. Remonstrances were made to 'Tehran whence came stringent orders to the Amir Mujahid not to interfere in either Lirawi or Dilam. In spite of these orders, the attitude of the Amir Mujahid became so threatening that, in April of this year, the Khans of Shahbankareh, Angali and Chahkutah all wrote to Haidar Khan of Hayat Davud saying that they were ready to send armed men to help the Lirawi and Davud Khans to resist Bakhtiari aggression in the coastal plain which they all fear. It is equally unwelcome to this Residency, which has no wish to see the disorder, bloodshed and rapine, which usually accompany the Bakhtiaris wherever they appear, devastate the comparatively tranquil and orderly dis tricts to the north and in close proximity to Bushire. The best solution from the point of view of this Eesidency is to place the district under the charge of the Government of the Gulf Purts. Geographically —Lirawi is, like Arabistan and Hayat Davud on each side of it, south of the coastal range. Historically. —There is justification for the change, as Lirawi used to he under Bushire in the time of the Arab Shaikhs Trihally. —The Lttoral from the borders of Arabistan to Bushire is ruled by one family of Khans, all of whom recognise the Khan of Hayat Davud (Bandar Rig)) as their head. financially. —Lirawi is a fief, owned by a private landlord, and the revenue is paid through the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Central Govern ment and the owner of the fief. In July, it was rumoured that Haji Saiyid Said-us-Snltaneh was pressing for more revenue and threatening that, if he did not get it, he would sell or lease the district to the Bakhtiari Khans. In August the Resident wired to His Majesty's Minister suggesting that the Central Government should buy the Lirawi lands from Haji Saiyid Said-us- Sultaneh at the price he originally gave for them. He pointed out that it would be very profitable for the State and asked that the district might then be placed under the Governorship of the Gulf Ports. In the meantime the Lirawi Khans made another remittance of revenue to the Imperial Bank of Persia for the half-year ending the 21st September 1913, for remittance to Said-us-Sultaneh. In October 1913, two more Bakhtiari Governors again appeared at Behbehan and renewed their demands for revenue on the 31st October last. The Resident addressed a despatch to His Majesty's Minister urging the placing of the district of Lirawi under the Gulf Ports and its purchase by Central Government. Later, the Resident addressed the Government of India on the subject pointing to the dangers of Bakhtiari aggression with special reference to the possibility of their being used as a catspaw by the Russians, who were said to be acquiring considerable influence over the Bakhtiari chiefs. Prom the foregoing remarks about the condition of Pars, it will hardly he ^ ,, ,, , . ^ expected that we should be able to give Condition ot trade routes m 1 are. i? xi x -PoTrrmrstlilp for the present year any more tavouraoie comments on the condition of the Bushire-Ispahan road than were given last year. Still, some progress has been made; ' ' has been checked, and a combination of the Bushire forwarding merchants, under the aegis of tne Governor of Bushire, has been able to effect a very considerable diminution of the rates of hire. The 1912 report left the average transport rate at 395 Krans per 100 maunds. As mentioned last year the rate actully touched 5oO Krans. So early as March of this year, Mr. Chick, the Commercial Adviser to the Consul-General for Pars, was able to congratulate the community of forward ing agents on a reduction from 440 Krans to 300 Krans per 100 Bushire maunds. It was then hoped to reduce the rate still further and this hope was fully realised, for the rate went down to 255 Krans per 100 Shiraz maunds tor piece-goods, and 270 Krans per 100 Bushire maunds for sugar. They rose again slightly at the end of the year to 270 Krans for piece-goods and 290 Krana for sugar,FOR THE YEAH 1913. 33 The ' Naqlieh' department has been severely criticised, but it is sub- m itted that critics do not realise that the root of the evil has nothing to do w ith the department but is the ' deficiency of mules.' It is hard to see the remedy for this trouble^ as the mules are no longer bred. Persia has too many crying needs to permit her to think of such luxuries as encouraging mule breeding and it will take years of security to bring back the old state of affairs when 6,000 mules per month went up and down the Bushire-Ispahan road loaded Tvith merchandise. It is even doubtful whether it would be worth while making serious efforts in this direction, were such possible, as it seems that before long mechanical means of transport must abolish the antiquated u caravan.' Captain C. B. McConaghy, I. M. S., held the post of Chief Quaran- Quarantine and Eefiidency Hospital. Officer in the Persian (jult until the month of April when he proceeded on long leave to England and was succeeded by Major S. Hunt, I. M. S. Major Hunt was away on leave during the month of December when his duties were temporarily performed by Captain M. D. Wadia, I M. S., Medical Officer to the Wing of the 102nd K. E. O. Grenadiers, now stationed at Bushire. Captain G. G. James, I. M, S., stationed at Mohammerah acted as Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer till the middle of June. He then took leave and reverted to military duties in India, and no Medical Officer could be spared to take his place. Bushire was free from epidemic disease excepting for a few cases of plague which occurred mostly in the small villages near the town amongst the fishing community. All the cases occurred in April and May. 104 persons were inoculated at the dispensary as a protection against plague. General Birdwood, Secretary, Army Department, accompanied by Colonel y isitg&gt; I ^ee, Military Secretary to the Viceroy, visited Bushire in an unofficial capacity, in November 1913. Admiral Peirse also visited Bushire in the same month. The Hesident left for Maskat in H. M. S.

Eye-diseases abound and treatment for sore eyes is much appreciated. A large number of Muhammadan and Jewish women attend. The building occupied by the dispensary is well situated but poorly adapted far taking in-patients and the change made in 1912 was a retrograde move. The provision for a decent hospital for Bushire is much to be desired and has been mooted by a few leading members of the community, but it seems desirable for it to take the form of a development of the existing Eesidency Dispensary rather than that the latter should suffer or be eclipsed in any way by an independently conducted institution. Many anonymous complaints against various members of the dispensary staff came to hand. With the concurrence of the Political Resident, a com plete change in the subordinate staff was made towards the end of the year. The working of the Quarantine arrangements at all the Gulf Ports includ- Q . ing Kuwait and Bahrain has gone smooth- Samtary and Qaarantme Affairs. -i 0 -, x • &lt;» i -i i ly and satisfactorily, and there has been no change in the personnel except at Bushire. The Clayton Gas Disinfecting Machine was overhauled and kept in satis factory working order and was located temporarily at Mohammerah instead of Bushire. Plague appeared at Bushire and Dibai. Bushire was reported plague p lague infected from 16th April to 24th May. The epidemic was a mild one and only 30 cases with 25 deaths were recorded. Dibai was the only other port infected with plague, which lasted from 13th Pebruary to 5th August. Dibai is a weak spot in the Quarantine Ad ministration of the Gulf, and a source of danger to other ports, especially Bahrain and Lingah, and will remain so till a medical officer can be posted there. In April one fatal case of plague occurred on board the Persian Customs S. S. sc Muzaffari' and the ship was fumigated and deratized (?) at Mohammerah. No cases of Cholera or other epidemic disease occurred at any port in the Chalera - Persian Gulf during the year.FOE THE TEAR 1013. 37 CHAPTER II, admimstration report op the vice-consulate, lingah for the year 1913. Mr. R. H. New was in charge of the Vice-Consulate, Lingah, until Personnel. the 17th October 1913, when he handed . . -o t - .. , over charge to Mr. G. A. Mungavin who arrived from Bushire on the 12l;h idem. The latter was in charge at the end of the year. 5 Deputy Governor.—mvia, Mahmud Khan retained the appointment up Local Officials. to the 20th of December, when he was x-nj 4 -i i , r . _ _ Sieved by the Midhat-us-Sultaneh, Kargu- zar at Bandar Abbas. Mirza Mahmud Khan, outwardly correct, and friendly was unfortunately unscrupulous and greedy, and extorted illegal fines on every possible occasion. In May, Karbalai Muhammad Husain, late Deputy Governor ot Mmab, was appointed Bais-i-Adliyeh (Chief Justice) in Lingah on a fixed salary of 50 tomans per mensem with the result that the monthly returns from court fees mounted appreciably. The Deputy Governor had been in the habit of appropriating them. In accordance with orders received from the Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh, through the Customs Director, Bushire, Mirza Mahmud Khan was transferred to Bushire at his own expense. Midhat-us-Sultaneh, the new Deputy-Governor, is a young man of about 27 years of age. He speaks English fairly fluently and appears to be intelligent, and well-mtormed, though he is lacking in experience. He seems at present inclined to work with His Majesty's Vice-Consul and no doubt will find out with experience that this is his best policy, especially as very little can be done locally without the support of His Majesty's Vice-Consulate. Karguzars. There has been no permanent Karsruzar throughout the year. Hassam-e-Sadat, formerly Deputy Karguzar of Lingah and Bandar Abbas, was appointed Mufattish-i-Hakumat by H. E. the Muwaggar-ed-Dowleh. The duties of Karguzar fall on the Deputy-Governor. In his capacity of Mufat- tish-i-Hakumat Hassam-e-Sadat visited Lingah in August. Turkish. Mr. E». H. New remained in charge of Turkish interests until Foreign representatives. the end of March. It is true that, on the . 3rd March, Monsieur Bifaat Bey arrived m 1 - ^ ons ^ a:,:l ^ lno P^ e - The Imperial Persian Government had recognised him officially as Turkish Consul at Lingah, but his arrival at Lingah, was the first intimation received by either the local Deputy Governor or His Majesty's representative, of the new appointment. Pending receipt of official notifica- 7^ e ^ overIlor, arrived on the 29th March, Monsieur Jiiiaat Bey should not be recognised locally. The Turkish Consulate was formally opened on the 31st March with great pomp and ceremony ; in response to official invitations, the Deputy Governor ana His_ Majesty's Vice-Consul were present. Prayers were offered up by a ocai Mulla named Shaikh Muhammad Mehdi when the flag was hoisted amid cheers from the crowd. The appointment has been most unfortunate and prejudicial to our interests, both here and on the Trucial Coast, and is to be regretted. It was undoubtedly brought about by the intrigues of a local Persian subject Muham mad Abdullah Khwajeh. fP? ^ UI1 . e » Monsieur Eifaat Bey left Lingah for Basrah, and notined to His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul that Salim Khwajeh (whom he a appointed as Secretary to the Turkish Consulate), would be in charge of iurJash interests during his absence. n ^ Monsieur Bifaat Bey, following the procedure adopted by his e ague, Ahmad Hamdi, Turkish Consul at Bushire, in September 1909,38 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT notified the Arab and Persian Steamship Companies Agents at Lingali thai- all steamers leaving for Basrah or other Turkish Ports, should submit 'thei Bills of Health to him with a view to having them visM. The Steamsti^ Companies were instructed not to comply with this illegal request. In September, an Arab, subject of the Shaikh of Dibai, was wrongfully granted a passport as a Turkish subject, to which the local Deputy Governor took exception. Monsieur Eifaat Bey again left Lingah for Basrah on October 1st when his Secretary once more acted for him. He did not return until December 1st, when he merely passed through by Russian steamer en route for Constan tinople. Salim Khwajeh continued in charge of Turkish interests, and though no longer recognised officially by the local Deputy Governor, and Customs after the Turkish Consul's departure for Europe, continued to fly the Turkish riag up to the end of the year. Muhammad Tahnun has continued in office as Agent for His Highness Maakat .„d Oman. the Sult T f ? f 0man du ™g ^ year. He is not officially recognised by the local authorities, and has instructions, in case of need, to request the assistance of His Britannic Majesty's Eepresentative. {a) Early in Eebruary a petty quarrel occurred at Duvan between the Local Government. Ale and Jowasmi tribes . over fishing rights, which nnally developed into a serious disturbance in which Shaikh Khalfan bin Musabbah Ale Ali took an active part by wound ing two Jowasmis and imprisoning three of their leading men. Half the village of Duvan is in the jurisdiction of the Charak district, while the other half, occupied by the Jowasmis, is in the Lingah district. On their release, the Jowasmis came to Lingah and reported the matter to the Deputy Governor, demanding that Khan Bahadur Aqa Badr be asked to take up their case, and protect them from the oppression of the Ale Alis, The Deputy Governor offered to use his influence and promised to write to Shaikh Khalfan, but the Jowasmis frankly stated that his (the Deputy Governor's) influence and intervention would be worse than useless. The Deputy Governor finally appealed to Khan Bahadur Aqa Badr to try and intervene, but was informed that he was unable to interfere without the orders of the Political Resident, or this Vice-Consul ate. It is understood that the Deputy Governor referred the matter to his Chief in Bushire. About the middle of the same month, about 70 of the Jowasmi tribe decamped from Duvan and settled at Mughu and Bustaneh. {b) A coolie carrying a bag containing 2,000 rounds of Mauser ammuni tion was caught by tufangchis in the bazaar in May and was taken before the Deputy Governor. The latter is said to have stated that the ammunition belonged to a friend of his named Muhammad Amin Avazi, to whom he intended to return it, which he subsequently did. Numerous changes took place with regard to Customs Directors during the year. Monsieur Willemsens was relieved by Monsieur Collette in 1912 and the Customs. latter remained in office till May 1913, when Monsieur Van Den Abele was sent to Lingan to relievo him. In August Monsieur Moreau relieved Monsieur Van Pen Abele, who was transferred to Ahwaz. Monsieur Moreau only held temporary charge pending Monsieur Willemsens , return, which was on 17th of October, iho latter has remained in charge since. Monsieur CoJlette was brusque but not unreasonable and sravo little trouble. &amp; XT •^ ons i eur Van # Den Abele was easy-going and could not control his staff. He lett matters to his subordinate Mr. Martin Paul an Armenian, formerly m the Persian Telegraphs. Drunken brawls took place among the CustomsFOR THE YEAR 1913. 39 employ^, whom the Deputy Governor had to pacify as best he could, and at last the conduct of Mr. Paul grew so outrageous that His Britannic Maiesty's Vice -Consul was oblisred to request the Political Resident, Bushire, to use his influence, and Mr. Paul was removed from Lingah. Monsieur Moreau was a happy-go-lucky individual who took little interest in his work. Monsieur Willemsens on the other hand is almost the polar opposite to his confreres. He is most energetic and apt to carry matters to extremes He lacks in tact, and this defect with excess of zeal often leads to disputes with the local merchants, with whom he is most unpopular. He carries his per sonal likes and dislikes with him into his office. He is inclined to be anti- British^ though he has often stated that the best policy is to work hand-in- glove with the British officials. He does so in most cases, but only because he must. Smuggling of arms and ammunilion, tea, coffee, aniline dye«, tobacco, etc., Kevenue. continues, though the supply of arms . and ammunition from the Arab Coast has fallen off greatly. During the year a Customs launch has been stationed at Lingah, but she was in no way utilised to try and prevent smugoiin 0 ', but merely to collect revenue from the outposts. The collection of all land revenue has been in the hands of the Customs throughout the year. Great difficulty has been experienced at times by them in collecting the revenue from the outposts, and they have been compelled to apply to His Britannic Majesty's representative for assistance. The sanction of the Political Resident was obtained and Khan Bahadur Aqa Badr was therefore requested to use his influence with the various semi-independent Chiefs. General advice and assistance was afforded the revenue officials until Mr. Martin Paul, who during the year was appointed Amin-i-Maliyat, began to intrigue, and set a course of his own which we could not countenance. Mr. Martin Paul's dealings were crooked and some of the collections were very cleverly misappropriated. Naband. The same state of things prevails in Naband, as during the previous year. His Excellency the Governor of the Gulf Ports has promised to restore the villages unjustly taken from Shaikh Muhammad Khalfan, and, although there has been some talk of an expedition being sent by His Excel lency, up to the end of the year nothing had been done. Most of the villages, some of which are within half a mile of each other, have no communication with one another, and the villagers are in constant fear of attacks from their neighbours. Lav. —Lar and the surrounding country was in a constant state of unrest throughout the year. In March Ghulam Husain Khan, the Governor of Lar and Chief of the Varavi tribe, was treacherously shot by Saiyid Haji Baba of Bairam, at a feast given by the latter at Lar. This naturally led to a fi^ht between the followers of the respective chiefs, in which some 18 or 20 casual ties took place. Saiyid Haji Baba himself expired a few days later from wounds received at the time. Abdul Husain Khan, the elder son of Ghulam Husain Khan, succeeded his father as Chief of the Vara vis. Kawam'Ul'Mulk.-—NQ^ of the Kawam-ul-Mulk's intended expedition to Lar did not tend to improve matters in the interior. Saiyid Abdul Husain, the Mad Mulla, commenced stirring up the people, and collecting fighting men rroni the various tribes, with a view to opposing the Kawam. The Kawam's advent was anxiously awaited by numerous Lari merchants, who had become tired of the tyranny of the Mad Saiyid, whose headstrong acts had led to a state ot chaos. Trade with the sea-ports had be3ome a most precarious undertaking, it is anticipated that the trade between Lingah, Bandar Abbas and the interior will show a very considerable improvement, once the Kawam has got the coun ty properly under control, Badak. —The Bastakis have been fairly quiet on the whole. The Chief oi -Bastak, the Sowlet-ul-Mulk, had some slight trouble with some of his own subjects, the Janahis, which necessitated Muhammad Eiza Khan going to anah with a small force of tufangchis. A fight ensued in which two of40 PEE SI AN GTFLF ADMINISTRATION REPOUT Muhammad Riza Khan's tufangchis were killed. Eventually a settlement was arrived at and he was allowed to enter the town. Shibhuh. —Considerable damage was done to many houses and forts in the Cugam, Kalat, and Chiru Districts by an earthquake in March. Twelve people were killed. In June, Ishkanu was raided by a band of Turk Nafar robbers, who, after killing and wounding about 15 Ishkanunis, carried off much property and cattle. Baqar Khan, the Chief of Ishkanu, together with his eldest son, Hasan Ali Khan, were killed in the month of October by six men deputed by the brother of the late Saiyid Baba of Bairam, who, it was said, was in constant fear of an attack from Baqar Khan. Mirza Ali Khan, another son of Baqar Khan, succeeded his father as Chief of Ishkanu. The Shuja-i-Mzam, Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas, visited the Shibkuh Ports in the Persia^ Eevenue Cutter ' Muzafferi ' about the middle of October, in connection will Maliyat duties. He was accompanied by 20 tufangchis.

About the middle of January the roads from Lingah and Bandar Abbas to Lar, were held up by 600 Turk Nafar robbers who were reported to have carried off a caravan of 200 donkeys. A large band of robbers also plundered, and carried off 2 caravans of 200 animals each, between Lar and Jahrum, in July. Tufangchis were despatch ed from Jahrum to recover these, and, after a severe fight in which they lost about 20 men, they succeeded in re-capturing 200 donkeys. Most of the caravans returning to Lar during the year took up piece-goods, sugar, and kerosine oil. During 1912 most of them returned up-country empty through fear of being robbed. The following is a list of the caravans which arrived at Lingah during the year 1913 :— From Number of caravans. Number of animalsj Articles brouglit down.

Arms landed along the Shibkuh Coast further west taan Chiru, and those east of Birkeh Sifla have not been taken into account, as reports from these quarters cannot be relied upon. The total number would be considerably swelled if these could be accurately ascertained. The most popular type of rifle still appears to be the *275 Sporting Mausei, the price of which in the interior is said to have ranged between E300 an R400. The increase in the price confirms our diminished returns.FOR THE YEAR 1913. 41 The Hamburg-Amerita S. S Ekbatana, ' which arrived at Lingah on the 1st of June, was suspected of carrying 15 cases of arms and ammunition for this Port. As they had no opportunity of landing these cases on the night of the 1st, Herr Hosenfeld, of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company the Steamship Company's Agents, proceeded to Bushire by the steamer with a view, it was thought, of facilitating matters for discharging the arms either at Bahrain, or at one of the other small Persian Coast Ports, or perhaps arranging for dhows to take delivery at sea. 0 Only 13 rifles and 5 Mauser Pistols are said to have been jettisoned by boats crossing over to the Persian Coast, but no doubt the actual figures were much larger. In 1912 as many as (555 rifles and 43 Mauser Pistols were jettisoned. Both the applicants for manumission, whose cases were still pending at Slave Traffic. 9^ 0se y ear j were manumitted. During the year 14 slaves applied for redress, two were manumitted, one bolted after lodging his complaint, of the remainder one returned to his master, and the rest were dismissed.

The bulk of the imports by German Steamers consisted of Crystal and Loaf Sugar. Only 2 steamers called on the homeward voyage and this was in order to land cargo overcarried on the up trip. The number of packages embarked at the Port for Europe amounted to 71 which were alf shells, except for two bales which contained tobacco.

His Excellency attempted to land on the 25th, but was compelled to return to the Plagsnip owing to heavy seas which made landing impossible. His Excellency Eear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, K.C.I E , K.C.V.O., visited Lingah in H. M. S. ' Sphinx' on the 1st December with the other members of the Oil Commission. His'Excellency and party landed at 8-30 a.m . on the 2nd. and remained ashore the whole day, prospecting for oil. A well from which water was drawn in the presence of His Excellency and party, showed traces of oil, but they were unable to say whether this was a natural spring, or whether the oil had got into the well by accident.

The pirates, who were captured by Shaikh Sagar of Nahand, were handed over to His Britannic Majesty's representative, together with the money robbed by them Hia Britannic Majesty's representative proceeded to Kuwait with the prisoners and handed them over to the Political Agent, Kuwait. 5 Another serious case of piracy and murder occurred later in the year this also being committed on a Kuwait ballam. The four culprits who were the Somali crew of the ballam were captured at Lingah on the Mail Steamer ' Baroda ' and were returned to Kuwait. E391 and £25 were found in their possession, while later on El,772, which the private crew had hidden between Chiru and Kalat, was unearthed, one of the prisoners eventually wil lingly showing the spot where they had hidden the money. One of the most important events of the year was the completion of the Persian Gulf Light House Works. Tanb Island Light House, under the superintendence of Mr. C. J.

Assistant Surgeon J. Johnstone, I.S M.D., was in charge pf the quarantine Quarantine. operations during the year. It was solely . through the energy displayed by this Officer m systematically and personally examining dhows, after plague had broken out in January at Hibai and at other places on the Trucial Coast, that the disease was kept out of Lingah. In April, plague even broke out at Kalat and Chiru, on the Persian Coast, but all the roads were guarded and people were not allowed to enter the town from these places, before being medically examined, and undergoing quarantine. Quarantine restrictions against Hibai were removed at the end of August when the Port was declared free from plague. Majort Hunt, I.M.S., Chief Quarantine Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf, visited Lingah on the 16th of October and inspected the Quarantine Station. G. A. MUKGAVIK, ■His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident^ Lingah.44 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPOItT chapter 111 ADMINISTRATION REPOET FOR THE BANDAR ABBAS VICE- CONSULATE FOR THE YEAR 1913. The year under review presents a striking contrast to those immediately pre- r ceding it, and the dawn of more peaceful and more prosperous times appears at leno-th to be breaking over South Eastern Persia tuough it is early days yet to pr jphesy. It is true that incursions by Baharlus occurreji in February and again in March but these disturbances were sporadic and their effect was but temporary. No caravans conveying British owned goods were robbed during these raids, and the condition of the trade routes to the interior was more satisfactory than it had been for many years past. Peaceful conditions were the rule and not the exception as heretofore, and the confidence of merchants, which had been rudely shaken by the frequent robberies oi the preceding 3 years, was a in great measure restored. Captain H. V. Biscoe, His Majesty's Consul, held charge of the Vice-Con- sulate up t^ the 12th Mav, when he v ice-Consulate. proceeded on 3J months privilege leave, returning on the 27th August During his absence the Head Clerk, Mr. N. J. Gazdar, was in charge. On return from leave Captain Biscoe continued to hold charge up to the eod of the year. The Russian Government continued to maintain a Consular Agency here „ ^ and were represented by Mirza Muham- oreign epresen a ivos. Ali Sadid-us-Sultaneh. He proceed ed to Bushire in August, to visit the newly-appointed Russian Consul there, and while there received a decorat'on consisting of a gold medal with ribbon. He takes but little part in local affairs of any kind. Mirza Ali Karam Khan, Shuja-i-Nizam, was Deputy-Governor of Bandar- . „ ± Abbas throughout the year, and proved oca ovemmen . himself a thoroughly satisfactory incum bent. He was zealous in his efforts to obtain redress for British subjects, and to settle their disputes, and succeeded in recovering several long outstanding claims. He is illiterate but not lacking in intelligence, with a genial manner, and is on very friendly terms with His Majesty's Consul. Saiyid Husain, Hassam-us-Sadat, was Karguzar till the 23rd January when he was relieved by the Midhat-us-Sultaneh, a young English speaking Persian. As might have been expected he lost no time in embroiling himself with the Shuja-i-Nizam, whom he despised, both on account of his parentage and of his lack of education. Their relations continued very strained until July, when the Midhat-us-Sultaneh's salary having been reduced from tomans 150 a month to tomans' 45, he resigned the post and left for Bushire. From that time the post of Karguzar remained vacant, all references from the Consulate being dealt with by the Deputy-Governor. It had long been customary here to refer tin majority of cases direct to the Deputy-Governor instead of to the Karguzar, who was consequently a wholly superfluous official. By his removal the practice has become regularised and a useful precedent established, should an officious individual be at any time appointed as Karguzar. The Hassam -us-Sadat however arrived from Bushire on the 4th August, and took up a new appoint ment under the title of Mufatishi-Hukumat, his functions being apparently to inspect the accounts of the Deputy-Governor of Lingah and Bandar Abbas, presumably in order to enable the Governor of the Gulf Ports to exercise some control over them. Towards the close of the year he was put in charge of the Passport Office as w T ell. Under instructions from Bushire the Shuja-i-Nizam proceeded on a revenue-collecting tour to Kohistak, in June, where he met Mir Barkat Khan and Mir Haji, and according to his own statement succeeded in extracting ■ ^FOR THE YEAR 1913. 45 tomans 3,000 revenue from them, the first time these gentry have paid for many years. He was also sent on another revenue-collecting mission to Bandar Dha- ladha, Tahri, Kangun, etc, on the 18th October, in the S. S . 44 Muzafferiand was away till the 21st December, his brother Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan acting in his stead. Karbalai Muhammad Hasan was Deputy-Governor, Minab, till the end of February, when he resigned the post and proceeded to Bushire The Shuja- i-Nizam thereupon appointed his son, Kohandal Khan, Deputy-Governor to the post, which he retained up to the end of the year. He appears to have been very high-handed in his dealings with the Persians but had the sense not to molest British subjects. However, towards the close of the year it was rumoured that he was not wholly disinterested in the arms traffic; informal representations were therefore made to the Shuja-i-Nizam and he was removed a few days after the close of the year. As usual there have been several changes during the year among the Belgian Cugtoms Director of Customs at this Port, and the system of constantly transferring their officials from one place to another which appears to find favour at Tehran, c6ntinues, to the great detriment of commercial interests. Monsieur Zwinne held the appointment from the 1st January till the 20th March, when he was transferred to Bushire and handed over charge of the office to a com mittee of 3 Persian clerks On the 30th March Monsieur Willemseds arrived from Lingah and assumed charge of the post: he remained in charge till the 6th October when he was relieved by Monsieur Eourman from Mohammerah, who remained in charge to the end of the year ; his contract however expires early in 1914, and he is anxious to proceed on leave. Eeference was made in last year's report to the conduct of Monsieur Zwinne; his departure therefore was in no way regretted. Monsieur Willemsens, his successor, can be summed up in the words fc well-meaning but incom petent'. Soon after his arrival he started squabblinff with the Deputy Governor over financial matters, and the tension continued until his depar ture. He appeared to regard himself as morally responsible for the general conduct of the Deputy-Governor, a heavy burden to assume, and his attempted reformation of the latter's character did not conduce to friendly relations between them. Moreover on arrival here he discovered a large deficit in the Customs cash chest, and thus gained the hostility of his predecessor, Monsieur Zwinne, who was now his superior at Bushire. Feeling himself thus unsupported he tried to induce His Majesty's Consul to act as mediator in his various disputes with the local authorities, a r61e which Captain Biscoe declined to assume. His administration of the Customs also was singularly unsuccessful: filled with a zeal for reform, he took but little count of the realities of the situation, and instead of endeavouring to make the best of the means at his disposal he spent his time in elaborating schemes, most of which were counsels of perfection. He was extremely honest and obliging, and filled with good intention, but utterly unpractical. His successor. Monsieur Fourman, was already known at Bandar Abbas, having served here for three months in 1911, and is the best Director of Customs that has held charge here of recent times; firm with his employes, and tactful in his dealings with the local authorities and general public, his administration of the Customs leaves little to be desired. If only it were possible for him to remain here for some time several much-needed reforms could probably be put in hand, but, as mentioned above, he is already due for leave. The trade routes continued peaceful and secure throughout the year, ^ r except for a brief period in February oncUtion o t e country. ail ^ March when the district was overrun by a large force of Baharlu sowars. By a happy chance no caravans con veying goods belonging to British merchants were travelling at the time, and the only caravan which was robbed was one carrying merchandise belonging to Persian subjects. Throughout the year large quantities of merchandise were sent up to the interior, and reached their distination in safety.46 persian gulf administration report But though no merchandise was robbed during these raids, attacks were unfortunately made upon British subjects who happened to be travellino in the district. On the 24th February, Mr. Greene of the Karachi Extension Railway, who was surveying near Jallabi, a village about 30 miles from Bandar Abbas, was suddenly surrounded by some 50 Baharlu sowars who pro ceeded to strip him and his Indian followers of all they possessed, including their boots and most of their clothes. The robbers then having ascertained that Mr. Greene's money was in his camp near Jallabi made off in that direction: by a most fortunate chance some of the Deputy-Governor's sowars, who were returning from escorting a caravan, arrived at the camp before the raiders, and the latter thereupon refrained from attacking it. Meanwhile, Mr. Greene with his native surveyors, seeing the robbers departing in the direction of the camp, decided to make for Bandar Abbas. He had to walk 17 miles with bare feet, before he was able to obtain a donkey, and ultimately reached the Consulate, about 4 p. m ., in a very distressed condition. All his personal effects were subsequently restored to him, and the only actual loss sustained was that of some not very valuable garments which the party happened to be wearing at the time, and of some surveying instruments and field bocks v inch were wantonly destroyed by the raiders. A feature of this raid was the rapidity with which it was carried out. The district had been peaceful for some months past, and no rumours of the approach of the raiders preceded them, as is usually the case. They arrived without warning and left as rapidly as they came. The Deputy-Governor despatched tufangchis in pursuit of them, but the attempt was obviously futile since the raiders were all nearly mounted, and they succeeded in driving off a large number of herds of cattle and making .good their escape into Ears. Mr. Gieene subsequently proceeded in the Con sulate launch to Minab where he joined a survey party under Mr. Nunn who had come from Jask. The whole party then proceeded to Bandar Abbas, but, on the 11th March, when near Dehnan, some 25 miles from Bandar Abbas, they were attacked by another and more numerous band of Baharlu raiders. The survey party consisted of Messrs. Nunn, Greene, Watkins, Craker and about 100 followers, including an escort of 12 Baluchis supplied by Mir Mustapha of Biyaban, and 19, sowars of the Makran levy corps. The attack started at about 9 a. m „ just as the party were loading up to leave camp, and opened with some shots at long range. The country there is covered with low scrub, and had the raiders been other than what they were the position would have been a most serious one, as the attacking force had excellent cover to approach under. However they appear to have contented themselves with keeping up a fire at long range, to which Mr. Js r unn and bis party replied vigorously, and after some hours succeeded in driving them off. It is said that they lost seven men killed, while of the survey party four men were slightly wounded. Word was sent in to Bandar Abbas that day, and the local authorities at once despatched tufangchis to their assistance: they reached the Consulate at 6 p. m . on the evening of the 12th, without further incident. The raiders, however, who were under the leadership of one. Alia Kuli Khan, did not leave the district, and the scanty force of some 100 tufangchis maintained by the Deputy-Governor was obviously insufficient to compel them to do so. As the Deputy-Governor also stated that he was short of ammunition it was considered desirable to ask for one of His Majesty 's ships, and, on the 14th, H. M. S. ' Pelorus', Captain Hill, Senior JSTayal Officer, arrived. The main body of the raiders was reported to be at Issnv ten miles north of Bandar Abbas, and detached parties of sowars were visible on a low range of hills about one and half miles north of the Consulate. Captain Biscoe happened to be away at the time, and Mr. R. H. New, His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Lingah, under instructions from the Political Resident, proceeded to Bandar Abbas to assume charge on shore. On the 17th March, a naval party consisting of one officer, forty-one men, and two maxim guns was landed for the defence of the Consulate, and remained on shore till the 19fch, when they were relieved by fifty sepoys of the 2nd Queen Victoria's Own Rajputs under the command of Major A. Le P. Smith. Finding that the town was strongly held the raiders contented themselves with overrunning the district of Shamil, and after having collected large quantities of herds, camels, etc., finally concentrated at Issin on the 23rd, and left the district the follow^FOR THE TEAR 1913. 47 ing day.

The virtual ruler of the district has been Saiyid Abdul Hussain, a person who came into prominence at the time of the Nationalist revolution, and appears to have been opposed alike to Nationalists and Constitutionalists. Amon® other things he issued his own stamps, and for about a year these were to be found affixed to letters coming from Lar. It has been evident, however, that a numerous section of the population have wearied recently of the Saiyid's rule and internecine feuds have broken out among them : the advent of the Kawam therefore, will certainly be welcomed by many of the inhabitants and, should he succeed in finally establishing his authority over the turbulent nomad tribes of Laristan, much will have been accomplished towards the restoration of order in South Eastern Persia.

They are] however, a difficult community to assist, consisting as they do mainly of small agents of Shikarpur firms : the principals of these 5rms never visit Bandar Abbas and everything is left to the agents, who receive either a salary or a small share of the profits. These agents are not unfrequently unreasonable S tll ® ir 1 demarL ds, or even when they have a strong case endeavour to streno- then it by the most wild and exaggerated assertions : also they are generally split into several factions. A redeeming feature, however, is that, with their departure from India they seem to throw off their natural propensitv for litigation. They realise that it is preferable under the conditions existing here to endeavour to effect a settlement of a dispute in an informal manner tt ivt • tllan to file a . formal suit &gt; and the judicial powers with which His Majesty's Consul is invested are never exercised. The Steamship Oom- pames also being represented solely by native agents, further complicates matters, since they have no power to settle claims, etc , themselves and their representations do not appear to carry the same weight at the head ottices as they would if they were put forward by a European representative. 0 constant changes among the Directors of Customs further militate against any serious attempt to improve the extremely primitive customs arrangements. The chief requirements of the Port in the interests of British trade are leiegraphic communication with the interior of Persia and India instead 01 the high cable rates in force at present: improvements in the Customs premises and arrangements, and the representation of the British India Steam JMavigation Company by a European.

ADMINISTRATION EEPOET FOR THE KERMAN CONSULATE EOR THE YEAR 1913. His Britannic Majesty's Honorary Vice-Oonsul, Mirza Nasrullah Khan held local charge of the Consulate up British Consulate. to January 10th, when he was relieved by Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, I. A. The medical charge of the Consulate remained in the hands of Assistant Surgeon E. G. Steinhoff, Medical Officer to the Indo-European Telegraph De partment, Kerman. His Majesty's Consulate has been handicapped in recent years by the in adequacy and partial inefficiency of its staff, and it has been impossible for it while giving due attention to the constantly increasing demands of local politi cal and commercial work, to maintain any effective touch with the affairs and personages of the districts. Attempts were made to stimulate the Consulate Munshi at Bam to greater mental activity, of which the chief result was to make him ask for more pay; and to find suitable newswriters in Rafsinjan, Sirjan and other quarters, which likewise proved unsuccessful. With a view to remedying this state of affairs proposals have now been submitted to the Government of India for the appointment to Kerman of a junior Political Officer with the style of Vice-Consul who should act as assistant to His Majes ty's Consul and enable him to acquire, by means of touring, a proper knowledge of the affairs and people of the districts. The work of the Consulate has been referred to as constantly increasing- Correspondence is, of course, no exact indication of the amount of necessary and useful work done, but it may be admitted that no one is likely to be so lost to all sense of propriety as to make an idle hobby of official correspondence. Viewed in this light, the statistics of the amount of correspondence, etc., passing through this office, furnished in Appendix I, may be of some interest The character of the work which fell to be carried out during the year was not in all cases entirely pleasant. Circumstances required the Consulate, in several instances, to adopt an aggressive or pursuant policy. Hostile pro ceedings, which have resulted either in the expulsion or the discrediting of those concerned, were instituted against the Consulate English Clerk, whom it is hoped it may be possible shortly to dismiss; the debtor, Ali Asghar Khoi, Pandelis Josephides, certain British Baluchi Arms Traders, the Mirza of the Imperial Bank and Mr. Bruggmann not to mention, of course, the Amir Mufa- kham, Governor-General.

The Amir-i-Mufahham, Oovernorship and expedition. —The principal political event of the year was the reorganisation of the Revenue Department Political History. under European control, and the fight for supremacy which naturally ensued between the old style Governor-General and the new style European controller of the finances. The Amir-i-Mufakham was already established firmly in his office with all the prestige of having broken up and dispersed the bands of robbers who had been terrorising and decimating the countryside, when His Majesty's Consul arrived, on the 10th January, followed by Mr. Lecoffre, on the 17th. The Amir lost no time in impressing his views on the suitation upon His Majestys Consul and asking for his assistance. {a) He was bankrupt and asked for a sum of 40,000 tomans which he said was due to him from Government on account of his pay and expenses for the preceding two months. (&amp;) He urged the necessity of his making a tour with a military force round the districts of the Kerman Province for the purposes of collecting the revenue, of intimidating the disloyal and confirming the loyal. He would be able to undertake it if granted the 40,000 tomans claimed. (c) He complained bitterly of the enmity and dishonesty of Mirza Ibrahim Khan, Amin-i-Maliya, and the relations he had gathered round him in office. After a month and a half of negotiations in Tehran with the Treasurer General, and in Kerman with Mr. Lecoffre, to whom funds were remitted, an arrangement was arrived at, and a breach which threatened between the Amir and Mr. Lecoffre was avoided. Part of the Amir's claim was paid, and ne was relieved of certain financiaLresponsibilities by Mr. Lecoffre. He kept his word and started, on March 9th, for Bam. Here he remained for some Weeks recruiting his forces, arranging local affairs, and corresponding with s 2f 52 PEESIAN GVW APMINWRATION REPORT some of the Baluch chiefs. No results of any consequence were arrived at as regards Baluchistan. From Bam the Amir moved on through Narmashir and vid Mil-i-Earhad into Kudbar and Jiruft. The local chief of Eudbar, the Zargham-i-Nizam, declined to trust himself in his camp, but negotiations took place which resulted in the Zargham's paying up the balance of his revenue for the preceding year, some 13,000 tomans, as well as presents amounting to 7,000 tomans. He also came to a working understanding with the Amir for the preservation of order in the district. Tho Amir-i-Mufakham then proceeded to the Aqta Afshar country. Here he found that ready money, for the payment of the arrears of revenue, was not available. He referred to His Majesty's Consul and Mr. LecofPre who advised him to arrest and bring in the principal chiefs and leaders of rebellion in the Afshars tribe, Ghunj Ali Khan and the Sowlet-ul-Mulk. This he declared he was not strong enough to do. The Afshars tendered a nominal obedience, and it was alleged by the Amir that they eventually paid up the last year's revenue, gave undertakings for the arrears of previous years and for the good govern ment of their country, and restored the bulk of the property stolen by them in the preceding year. In return the Amir appointed one of themselves, Eath Ali Khan, as Local Governor and took three persons as hostages. In the meantime the Amir had been negotiating with and threatening the principal recalcitrants of Sirjan. Matters here did not go so smoothly for, on his .entering their country, most of these persons fled to the hills where they made a display of rebellion. Some show of fighting took place and, eventually, the chief ringleaders were secured, Hussain Khan, Bnchaqchi, two sons of J^ajaf Kuli Khan, and the Rashid-us-Sultan. Hussain Khan was released on parole, the Sirdar Nusrat going surety, and, as was to be expected, broke faith and escaped. The Amir proceeded with the remainder of his prisoners to Kerman» which he reached on July 5th, leaving the Sirdar Nusrat to settle matters wdth Hussain Khan. The fugitive was not recaptured but in some w r eeks of negotiations the Sirdar's forts are said to have resulted in security being obtained for the payment of the forfeited penalty. If it was ever recovered nothing is known of what became of it. From the point of view of the general security of the province the expedition had been a success, and it was with this object only that His Majesty's Consul had recommended and pressed for it. * If there was little fighting, and that only in Sirjan, no reverse was sustained by the Government force, while the province was reduced to a state of order, and the Amir's prestige was firmly established. Had the expedition not been undertaken it is probable that the unrest, still simmering after the rebellion of 1912, would have rapidly gained strength and led to the establishment of complete anarchy in the districts and on the trade routes. On the other t and, as a means of collecting revenue, the expedition cannot be called a success. Considerable sums of money were doubtless collected by the Amir but the bulk of them went into his own capacious pockets, while movable property of all kinds is said to have been despatched by him from Sirjan to his home in Kamara. All that he paid in or accounted for to the Revenue Agent in Kerman was 28,935 tomans. The Amir-i-Mufakham and the Revenue Department. —During the progress of the Amir's expedition frictipn had gradually been growing up between him and Mr. Lecoffre and the Revenue Agents in the districts. Tb» latter, especially the Ihtisham-ul-Lashkar in Jiiuft, complained that the Amir disregarded them and appointed Local Governors to whom he granted the privilege of collecting the revenue as their chief emolument. The Amir on his part complained that the Revenue Agents disregarded him and assumed all the powers of independent executive officers. After his return to Kerman the Amir frequently addressed His Majesty's Consul in this strain and accused Mr. Lecoffre of wanting to be ' Sultan' of the Province. There was just enough in appearances to make this charge difficult for a third person to meet. Mr. Lecoffre is a self-centered man with large ambitions and a sorne- what narrow mind, and his vanity makes him consciQusly and even unconsciously magnify the importance of his office and scope of his functions. Still more difficult was it to indulge in any general defence of his SU ^?W nates, who are mostly the creatures of Ibrahim Kham himself an undoubteaPOR THE YEAR 1913. 53 schemer and swindler, and wlio are not likely to be more angelic than other petty Persian officials of their class. When the Amir therefore indulged in tirades against Mr. Lecoffre and his agents and demanded a definition of the spheres of the Governor-General and the Hevenue Department, it was only possible to report by calling on him to adduce concrete facts and to establish them by definite proofs. Fortunately he was not prepared to take the necessary trouble, for there is little question that with the means at his com mand he could have made out |a strong case for himself which it would not have been easy entirely to upset. Later he began to devote his attention to the possibilities of Baluchistan as a plundering ground where he might pursue undisturbed the Persian hobby of getting rich quickly, and he pressed His Majesty's Consul to urge on the authori ties the necessity for sanctioning an expedition into Baluchistan in the autumn. His Majesty's^ Consul did not believe in the public utility of raiding expeditions into Buluchistan, until the Persian Government was prepared to occupy the country in force and have itself permanently represented in it by a Governor with an adequate backing of military force. He told the Amir so, and said that at present he was not inclined to recommend more than the creation of a chain of armed posts along the Kerman-Baluchistan boundary, which there was every reason to believe would suffice to restrict the activities of the Baluch tribes within the limits of their own country. There they might be usefully employed in gradually decimating each other. All that was immediately necessary was to prevent the recurrence of Baluchi invasions of Kerman territory such as those into Tahrud, Khabis, and Narmashir which had taken place during the year. Losing faith in the ability or willingness of the Consulate to play into his hands, and probably irritated by remonstrances which His Majesty's Consul had addressed to him regarding his excesses in Sirjan, the Amir now began to meditate taking matters into his own hands. He was further impelled to this by annoyance at the delegation of the gendarmerie and at Mr. Lecoffre's refusal to pay from the Kerman Treasury a sum of 10,000 tomans which the Persian Government had awarded him in satisfaction of old claims in regard to his campaign in the west of Persia. In the meanwhile he prepared for all emergencies by displaying an unwonted degree of pliancy in his actual dealings with Mr. Lecoffre. Indeed, towards the end of September, the latter had spoken of asking His Majesty's Consul to convey to him a formal acknowledg ment of his obliging and helpful attitude. The dismissal of the Amivi-Mufakhain. —Early in October the Amir got his opportunity and took advantage of it. A notice issued by Mr. Lecoffre to the effect that it was proposed shortly to introduce the Nawaqil tax (a tax on all animals and vehicles owned in or entering the town) gave rise to some talk and formal demonstrations. This could have been easily checked at its inception by the Amir, but he declared that he could take no measures except on direct orders from the Persian Government, though the tax was in accord ance with a law passed by the National Majlis^ and was in force in various other towns including the capital. Behind the scenes, the Amir gave the agitators assurances of his support and, at his instance,, the agitation against the Nawaqil was turned, into an outcry against the Revenue Department. Charges were brought forward against the office of the embezzlement of large sums, and the right of the opium excise officials forcibly to enter private houses was challenged as being contrary to Islamic Law, while the officials themselves were accused of outraging the modesty of women in the course of their visit ations. The agitators then proceeded to enforce a strike on the part of the weaving community for which the latter had no desire, and the police received orders from the Amir to abstain from any action. Por more than a week all work was at a standstill and the city was in the hands of the mob. Portu- nately the Kerman mob is on the whole a very well-behaved one. Meanwhile the agitators had taken ' bast ' in large numbers at His Majesty's Consulate and every endeavour was made to force the hand of His Majesty's Consul into taking part in the hue and cry against the ' Nawaqil ' and the Eevenue Department. His Majesty's Consul however occupied himself in trying to discourage the agitators and to press the Amir to take action to restoo, order. Eventually,PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT as the result of a reference to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, the Amir-i- Mufakham, who remained obdurate, was dismissed and his brother, the Sirdar Muhtasham, then and still in Tehran, was appointed in his place. The appointment was not however announced till the fourth week of the month. In the meantime the carpefc weavers' strike had come to an end, on the 13th October, but not before it had occasioned a loss estimated at nearly £1,000 to the foreign carpet merchants. The cessation of the strike had followed on the receipt of a telegram from, the Persian Government announcing that the 4 * Nawaqil' was abolished, which the Amir published with the omission of the word ' temporarily ' hoping thus to gain a cheap popularity. The Amir, on the 22nd October, publicly announced that he had resigned and that his resignation had been accepted. He withdrew from public affairs, sent out orders recalling the scattered parties of Bakhtiaris in the districts and eventually set out for Yezd with his Lieutenant, the Amir Hismat, on Novem ber 1st The gendarmerie arrived on October 21th, while the Amir was still in Kerman, but no friction of any kind arose between them and the Bakhtiaris Thus ended the Amir's attempt to crush Mr Lecoffre, for such it had been, and to assert the absolute supremacy of the Governor-Greneral over the Finance Department and all comers. That his failure caused him much chagrin is improbable as he and his men had secured for themselves all the readily securable property m the province and their only further hope of lucrative business lay in a Baluchistan expedition. The agitation did not however entirely cease on the Amir's departure. An outcry had been raised against the appointment of the Sirdar Muhtasham, which, while the Amir remained in the offing, was couched in the form of a demand for the reappointment of that most estimable Governor. On his final departure the cry changed to one of ' No more Bakhtiaris,' which was being reiterated by the wealthier class of the population up to the end of the year. The Oovernorship of Sirdar Nusrat. —On relinquishing the reins of Gov ernment the Amir-i-Mufakham had entrusted them, to the Sirdar Nusrat, an arrangement in which His Majesty's Consul concurred and which was subse quently ratified by the authorities in Tehran. In the fortunate absence of any serious outbreaks in the districts, the Sirdar Nusrat carried on the affairs of the Government in a satisfactory manner till the end of the year. He showed himself friendly to the newly arrived gendarmerie and, profiting by the lesson presented by the Amir-i-Mufakham, lie studied every means of commending himself to the good graces of Mr. Lecoffre. His deference to His Majesty's Consulate, based on his own lesson of the preceding year, and his appreciation of his own interests, and perhaps also in part on a genuine feeling of old friendship, did not fail at any time during the year. His faults appear to be principally the result of a desire to enjoy the position and importance in Kerman to which his rank entitles him combined with a weakness of character which makes him unable to sustain the part with credit in times of difficulty. The appointment of the Sirdar Muhtasham. —Ever since his appointment, the Sirdar Muhtasham has been announced as on the point of leaving Tehran to join his post, but the announcement still remained unfulfilled at the end of the year. His Majesty's Consul has been and remains of opinion that he will not appear in Kerman before Nauruz, March 22nd, and that it is improbable that he will come at all, unless he is granted a Baluchistan expedition. With out the latter, the post is not under present conditions sufficiently attractive financially to entice one of the bigger Bakhtiari Khans. Happily up to the present, the rebels and robbers of the province have almost entirely neglected their opportunities, save only in part the Baluchis. If this continues Mr. Lecoffre's dictum, that Kerman requires no powerful Governor, nor external armed force, will be made good. If it does not, the Persian Government will have incurred a serious responsibility. The cry of 'No more Bakhtiaris '* from those in the province who have anything to lose i-i natural and in itself must command the sympathy of any( POB THE YEAR 1913. 55 disinterested onlooker. Bakhtians carry the practice of extortion bevond the bounds of what is regarded as reasonable even in Persia, and the Amir-i Mufakham and his crew, in spite of his pious assertions to the contrary werp no traitors to their blood and traditions. As a result Kerman cannoVat the moment conveniently fill any more Lur stomachs and pockets. It is also questionable how Mr. LecofPres nerves and the Swedes'tempers would stand the presence of their common heles noires the Bakhtiari. In the exneriencf. nf His Majesty's Consul, the Amir-i-Mufakham, taken all ^uud was aVy favourable specimen of the Bakhtiari cousinhood and the Sirdar MuhtasliaTr; unless he is now a reformed character, is not at all likely to be an improvement on him. In the review of the general course of the administration of the province during the year, the more important matters of internal political interest have been touched on, but some further details regarding district politics and local institutions may now be given under separate heading! Despite the intermittent appointment of Governor's agents in Rudbar Rndbar. J n d the delegation in autumn of a small . p ,, j n , : ^ orce Bakhtiari sowars nominally for the protection of the roads, all real power and authority has continued to rest m the hands of the Zargham-i-Nizam of Kahnu. The Bakhtiaris' activities were principally devoted to extracting Sahdari (illegal road tax) from caravans. The Zargham is a man with a natural bent towards submission to authority; but if the way of transgressors is hard, that of those who trv to abide by the law m Persia is harder, and the wisdom and wills of the seroent are necessary to the virtuous. r At the beginning of the year, the Zargham sent in 2,000 tomans to the Amir-i-Mufakham as an earnest of the payment of his arrears of revenue. Later, during the Amir s expedition, he came to terms with him, made considerable payments and was made officially responsible for the safety • u® v. i. i • J e ,)een no reason to complain of the manner in which he has carried out his duties. When the Baluch invaded Jiruft and Rudbar m IJecember, he mustered what force he could and went in pursuit. In spite of two disastrous actions, he persisted in his course to beyond Ria-an From there he returned, but he is said to be hatching plans for a retaliatory expedition into Sarhad. He is a relation by marriage of Sirdar-i-Nizatn of Geh, but by taste he is a firm friend of the Nawab of Narmashir with whom Sirdar- i-JV'zam isatprepetual feud. This produces complications in the relations of the Zargham who however appears in general to follow the dictates of friend- «mp rather than those of affinity. The district is the haunt of Afshar Turks who are principally Nomads by Aqta Afshar. habit and all robbers by profession. The • 0 i • T11 , . „ , , . chief figures are Ghunj Ali Khan, who si^ns himself Ilkhani and his nephew the Sowlet-ul-Mulk. Ghunj Ali Khan tad been arrested m connection with the rebellion of 1912, but had been released again. The early part of the year was occupied with quarrels between the two leaders which ended in the Sowlet being driven out of the Afshar coun- {V- TvL 5 ha n Professed himself willing to pay in the revenue due from himself. When the Amir-i-Mufakham approached the Afshar country on his towhe was joined by the Sowlet-ul-Mulk who had just before been implicated or wm stated to have been implicated, in a caravan robbery at Isfandaqah. Tii.on 'rri, Ti 1 ! 0Ver t0 1118 S1( k reoe ived him well and sent him off in peace, me Afshar put up no fight, and the question of the payment of the revenue was made a subject of negotiation. As stated above the Amir was i!

They appear to bv smpn -S aiIie ^ om robbery, and Ghunj Ali Khan has made various attempts y pecious. words to get himself into the good books of the Financial Agen56 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT and to commend his purity of motives to His Majesty's Consul. He tag also, it is believed, made friendly overtures to the gendarme officers. AH this is much in itself but negatively it is a great improvement on his attitude during 1912. It will be interesting to see later what sort of practical relations are established between the Afshars and the gendarmes. Sirjan had ended 1912 badly by revolting against the Amir-i-Mufakham 's nephew, the Salar Am]ad, and turning Sl ^ an ' him out of the place after a Governorship of only 18 days. They alleged excesses and oppression on his part which he had not had the time, whatever his will may have been, to perpetrate. Sirjan appears to have possessed a number of rich families who had acquired their wealth by methods familiar in Persia but irregular, and were outraged at the idea of being forced to part with it by the same methods. Russain Buchaqchi is a worthy member of that fraternity of robbers. Arrested for his share in the rebellion of 1912, he had been allowed to escape by the Adl-us-Sultan (the Sirdar Nusrat's brother). He was now a robber, a rebel, and a revenue defaulter. Ahdul Eussain Khan was an Irresponsible youth who had surrounded himself by a gang of armed 'ne'er do week' by whom he allowed his actions to be governed. Others were JSajaf KM Khan and the Itashid-ns-Sultan. In spring, at the instigation of these ruffians, a large number of Sijanis sent in a petition to the Consulates and chief authorities in Kerman demanding that the Amir-i- Mufakham should not enter their country. This has, of course, elicited only a snub and the ringleaders say well to enter into negotiations with the Amir while he was in the Afshar country. It was believed that affairs had been prac tically settled, but whether the Amir's demands had been too big as was alleged or merely from fear that they might become so, as soon as he entered the^districtf the merchants raised all the forces they could muster and took to the hills. It appears that some skirmishing and more negotiations took place with the result that the persons HussakuKhaii and the Eashid-us-Sultan were secured. The former however escaped, leaving the Sirdar Nusrat, who, for reasons best known to himself, had gone surety for 10,000 tomans for him, to face the music. The Sirdar had no such sum of money and was much perturbed to find himself pressed on one hand by the Amir and taken to task on the other by His Majesty's Consul for improper conduct in going surety as a high Government official for a notorious rebel. He spent several agitated weeks in the country after the Amir had left before he obtained some sort ot guarantees for the payment of the forfeited security. The end of the story is not known, but the money never found its way into the coffers of the State. Murad Knan was appointed to the official chieftainship of the Buchaqchi in place of Hussam Khan, who continues to proclaim his own virtues and demand restoration. Ahdul JTusmin Khan's property and estates were forfeited. Subsequently he was wounded it is said by his own^men, and was brought in for medical treatment to Kerman where he still remains. The Eashid-us-Sultan was flogged and stripped of his property. H® ^ a8 then brought in town where he remained in confinement for several montus, no one caring to go surety for him. On release he raised some claim agamsi the Eevenue Department. His Majesty's Consul obtained for him an mterview with Mr. Lecoffre who had declined to see him, but the only result was tnai the Eashid went away further embittered saying that Mr. Lecoffre had pre tended not to understand Persian. Suck are the ruses of Persians ana o c of the Persian Government., The Governor who replaced the Salar Amjad at the beginning of the year and has remained in office throughout it, is MuMasham-ud -Howleh, bro ® Sirdar Nusrat, but he appears to have counted for very little m t taken of affairs in the district. • . .

As European consignments were apparently left immune the matter did not call for the attention of His Majesty's Consulate. The History of Bam is little beyond a chronicle of the bickerings of petty Bam. Khans and factions and querulous com- . plaints against its Governors, but Bam held a place in men's mmds as being at once the bulwark of Kerman against the Baluchis, and the threatened objective of invasions which they constantly projected and not infrequently carried out. As a matter of fact, though its outlying villages suffered, and it was repeatedly a place of refuge fortheir inhabitants, it sustained itself no direct attack. This sub-province, now entirely out of control of the Central Government, Baiuchist&amp;n. presents no feature of political unity'. It harbours merely a collection of jarring tribes, who, only to seek relief from the monotony of intertribal squabbling, combine at times their forces to raid the neighbouring districts and plunder their more industrious but feeble and defenceless population. Baluch internal politics are very involved, and it is not easy in Kerman to obtain any very exact or illuminating information regarding them. The number of petty chiefs is great and each has his own petty policy, controlled by petty necessities and circumstances. As far as can be gathered at present, most of the faction fighting in the province may be attributed either to an old feud between Said Khan, Sirdar-i-Nizam of Geh with Bahram Khan and Asian Khan against Nawab Khan, who sometimes enjoys the assistance of the Zar- gham-i-Nizam, or to that between Sherdil and various of the Sarhad chiefs against the Akram-us-Sultaneh, a Bam magnate who resides in Narmashir. It may be laid down that in existing circumstances Baluch disturbances to the east of the parallel of Bam are of no consequence to British and of small con sequence to Kermani interests. Could, however, the security of Narmashir be assured the commercial importance of Bam as an importing and distributing centre of foreign goods might be expected to increase. When, however, the parallel of Bam is crossed to the west the prosperity of Kerman and the safety of its external and internal trade are at once jeopardised. This was proved in practice in 1913. Tahrud Invasion. —Early in May, while the Amir-i-Mufakham was absent at Aqta, a large force of Baluchis was reported to be marching on Narmashir. The Governor of Bam raised all available forces and hurried off to Eigan to meet them, but the enemy gave him the slip and, on the 14th, a party appa rently 600 or 700 strong fell on the defenceless villages of Tahrud lying between Bam and Kerman. They gutted the villages and the Indo-European Telegraph Department Telephone office, plundered a large caravan at Sarvis- tan, and, returning again eastwards, pillaged the villages of Darzin, Marghak with a caravan they encountered there, Deh Bakri Damanaha, and Kuh-i-Saiyidi. The Governor of Bam hearing the news hastened back to Bam, which the Baluchis had already passed again on their way east, and gave them pursuit. He was worsted and the Baluchis pursued their homeward course via Duristan. Among the leaders of this raid were Wali Muhammad Khan, Agha Sherdil Khan, Darugha, Shah Abbas Khan and Shahsowar Khan. They are reported to have carried off from Tahrud over 800 camels, mules and mares, as well as cattle, and a number of female prisoners, while the value of property robbed or des troyed in the caravans was very large The Hindus alone, who were the heaviest sufferers, lost some 16,000 tomans (£3,000) worth of goods. It was only through their sheer bad luck that the Baluchis missed a caravan bringing up 150,000 tomans from Bandar Abbas for the Imperial Bank of Persia. About the same time, another strong party of Baluchis had made a descent into Khahis, where they stayed some time seizing or destroying everything they could lay their hands on. They appear also to have been active on the Khorasan road. Wider ambitions and a little determination would have secured them Eawar and Kerman, for the local authorities were practically5S PEESIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT powerless, in the absence of the Amir, who was too far off and himself too weak to give effective help. Attack on Bawar. —Though the Baluchis now retired, rumours were cons tantly current throughout the summer of further projected incursions and in September, they appeared again in Khabis and a party, fortunately only a small one, made its way as far as Eawar. The Rawaris with the small Government garrison made some show of resistance and, being probably much superior in number, drove off the enemy with some loss. Had they failed the pillaging of this important weaving centre would have entailed extremely heavy loss to most of the European carpet firms. Jiruft Invasion. —The rumours of invasion still continued through October and November and, towards the end of the latter month, a strong force actually entered Narmashir demanding the blood of Agha Khan. The G-overnor of Bam, Salar-i-Mufakham, had hurried to Eigan but found himself outnumbered. Fortunately for him, some say through his negotiations, the Baluch force broke up into two bodies one of which appears to have moved off towards Kashit and Khabis from which direction looting was subsequently reported. The other and main party advanced into Jiruft, where they plundered and murdered and took prisoners and again moved off gradually through Rudbar and Narmashir. This party was about 400 strong. The Zargham-i-Mzam turned out his forces, but twice suffered defeat and returned again to his home from Eigan leaving the Baluchis to pursue their way in peace to Sarhad. He bitterly reproached the Salar-i-Mufakham for not having co-operated with him. Thus stood the Baluch question when the year came to an end. The Baluch Problem. —It remains to say a word on what was done, and what it was possible to do, to mitigate the Baluch evil. In the first instance, in May, this quarter of the province attacked was depleted of all forces. Only at Bam was there a small force, perhaps 50 to 100 Bakhtiari sowars with the Amir Hismat. This man showed energy and pluck and probably saved Bam by his display of activity and readiness to take the offensive, and with the force at his command that was the most he could do. Beyond this, the attack was so sudden that it was impossible to organise any defence. All that could have been done was for the Amir-i-Mufakham to have hurried up with his forces from Aqta. This again would only have been useful had the Baluch raid developed into an occupation, and it would probably have meant a compensating outbreak in the Afshar country and Sirjan On the appointment to Bam of the Salar-i-Mufakham, who would not have had even the small Bakhtiari force that was at the disposal of his pre decessor, Mr. Lecoffre and His Majesty's Consul submitted proposals for the sanctioning of a monthly payment from the Treasury for the maintenance of a force of 200 mounted men at Bam. With some trouble a reluctant consent was wrung from the Treasurer-General, and the payment of 1,800 tomans a month, calculated to be sufficient for a force of about 200 men, was sanctioned in August. On the occasion of the second invasion, in November, His Majesty's Consul recommended the sanction of a grant for the levying of a force from the nomad and hill tribes of Kerman to oppose the invaders, but the proposal was rejected in Tehran. Such proposals are, of course, open to the objection that they must always entail a considerable waste and embezzlement of public funds, but anything is preferable to meeting Baluch aggressions with folded arms, and will prove cheaper in the long run. The Baluchis will give up these larger schemes as soon as they see that they are met with some pretence of force and are attended with risk. A Sirdar Muhtasham in Tehran and a Bakhtiari force in Ispahan have no terrors for them, while a Kermani Governor in Bam with a following of a hundred or two Bam peasants or loafers is an object to be treated with generous contempt' and none of the districts which the Baluchis visit has sufficient manhood or arms to put up any effective resis tance. The easiest way of dealing with the matter would, of course, be by a Persian military expedition, but to this there are many objections. To be at all successful it would require a large outlay by the State. The prout'63) FOE THE TEAE 1913. 69 would go to the officer in command and any improvement in the situation would end with his withdrawal or at any rate with his departure from Kerman which, it may be taken for granted, would soon follow his triumphant return with his spoils and booty. r The affairs of the city are necessarily predicated to a large extent by the Afiairs of Kerman City. «n ^ ^ 0f ^ ? 0vem0r ' and so tar as this is the case, they have al- „ ready been dealt with. Tliev can mnalW be referred to the basis of protest against authority, in one form or another whether the person of the Governor, or the enforcement of taxes or restric tions. In a commercial community there is also the authority and rights of the employers to be reckoned with, but questions arising in regard to these may be better dealt with under the heading ' Commercial. ,, As a class the religious leaders in Kerman would compare favourably with those m many other towns of Persia, and their influence is not very dominant. There are, however, individuals whose mischief-making is only limited bv their powers and opportunities Of these, Haji Mirza Ali Muhammad Muitahid is one. WhenHisMajesty sConsul arrived in January, he found the man at loggerheads with the Amir-i-Mufakham. It is tolerably certain that he had wrongly appropriated a piece of land belonging to others, and when the Amir after prolonged expostulation, proceeded to pull down a wall which he was building^ round it he was probably acting strictly in accordance with iustice. But justice m Persia has frequently to be tempered with diplomacy Ali Muhammad obtained on some pretext the protection of the Russian Consulate and was given the protection of Russian Cossacks and the Russian fla^ The AnuM-Mufakham found himself up against a stone wall and appealed for help to His Majesty s Consul. The latter refused to discuss the merits of the case but after some correspondence and discussion, secured the withdrawal of the Russian protection for which there was not even a pretext. At or before this point however, the Amir left on his expedition and the question was never finally settled. This did not impede Ali Muhammad from intriguing against the Amir and his Deputy Governor and harassing, by means of a band of his roughs those who had taken part against him, including the Tmam Juma. Later, Ali Muhammad founded a society called the Haiyat-i-Ilmi, whose object it was to assume to itself judicial powers in regard to disputes between the townspeople. He is also on the black list of the Revenue Office, and with a view to injuring it he has been agitating in the name of the Haiyat-Ilmi in favour of the Governorship of the Sirdar Muhtasham with his Bakhtiari force He is believed to have been one of the instigators of the disturbances in the town in October. When the Amir started out for the districts he left his Deputy Governor Muwaffaq-ud-Dowleh, to act in his place. This gentleman, a Tehrani, was pleasant enough but hard up and consequently corrupt. He was also weak for he lacked both force of character and the assurance of the Amir's confidence and support. Eventually he fell out with the Amir and suddenly took his departure ia the end of June. In the meantime a certain Itimad-ul-Mulk had started from Tehran to take his place. This man, who has Russian sympathies and a bad record, was objected to by His Majesty's Legation, and the appointment was revoked. He disregarded, however, all orders to stop at Yezd or return to Tehran and, despite all protests, forced his way on to Hafsinjan. Here, it is believed, the Amir-i- Mufakham bought him off, and he returned to Yezd. Various individuals were then proposed for the post, but eventually the Amir Hishmat was appointed on the suggestion of His Majesty's Consulate. His record at Bam was good and, aurmg his short tenure of office in Kerman, September and October, he gave satisfaction to all classes. He is a man who might make a good Governor under he new conditions which are being introduced in Southern Persia. I 11 April, rules were suddenly published by the local authorities regulating e conditions of the carpet-weaving business. They were largely of a hygenic- sanitary character and, as involving immediate large structural alterations in 1 26() PEESIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT the ordinary typo of factory, wer&amp;in most respects impracticable. They also included the appointment of an inspector who should have the uncontrolled right of entering every factory and imposing penalties for the breach of the new regulations. The whole weaving community at once rose in arms against these regula tions. The factory-owners and weavers, on the grounds of the impossibility of rebuilding their houses, and the European carpet buyers, on the grounds that their private designs would be placed at the mercy of the inspector, and that, in the closing of many factories, which was bound to take place, their contracts and advances would go to the winds. Both parties also pointed out that the inspector, who had already paid for his appointment, would only use his autho rity to enrich himself by fines, or bribes for remitting fines. Several hundred master weavers from the town and villages spent some days in bast at His Majesty's Consulate. His Majesty's Consul took up the ground that, though reforms were undeni ably desirable, the regulations were impracticable and the means proposed for enforcing them objectionable ; and at his suggestion the Muwaffaq-ud-Dowleh, who was only too ^lad to get out of the mess he found himself in, issued a notice that the regulations were withdrawn and would only be reintroduced after a discussion between the Government authorities and all parties inter ested. Nothing more was heard of the matter. There is no doubt that the industry as carried on is responsible for a great deal of human misery,^ in de forming and arresting the development of the children, especially the girls em ployed in it, but, official reforms in present day Persia can only be ineffective for their professed objects and a source of a hundred new abuses. A good deal is being quietly done by European merchants who use their influence to en courage the improvement of existing factories and the building of more sanitary new ones, while the Mission Hospital does what it can to relieve the misery which is caused by deformity and incomplete development. Many cripples with distorted misgrown legs obtain some relief and the lives, at least of many young would-be mothers, are saved, only, however, as a rule to be jeopardised again. After this the only serious affair in the town was the agitation, in October, against the Revenue Department already mentioned, which was the work of the Amir-i-Mufakham and a few mischief-makers, including, it is believed, Jallal ud-Din (Mulla), Mirza Yahya, and the Nusrat-us-Sultan. The later agitation against the appointment of the Sirdar Muhtasham was conducted on orderly lines, and it is not likely to become acute till there is some greater certainty of his ever coming to Kerman. Throughout the year His Majesty's Consulate was a place of general appeal to all aggrieved or malcontent people. In the early part of the year many Persians with prospective grievances addressed His Majesty's Consul with the hope of obtaining promises of protec tion ; some of them produced testimonials to their services in the public interest during 1912, granted by the Consulate. No promises or encouragement of any description was given to such applicants and they soon desisted from their efforts. The introduction of European control over the Revenue Department, and p ^ , the establishment of the gendarmerie The Revenue Department. ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ wer e likely to produce lasting results, for good or evil, in modifying the future course of affairs in the province. The balance of probability is in favour of their proving beneficial. In the problem of the reorganisation of, finance in the province there are at the moment two dominating elements, firstly, the personality of Mr. Leoott 1 ' 6 ' and secondly, the nature of the operation of pouring the new wine of effiwen control and protection of the revenues into the old bottles of the traclitiona^ system of Government by a supreme Governor-General, the main objec oFOR THE YEAR 1913. 61 whose administration is to enrich himself and maintain his followers on the esources in kind and cash of the province, without interference from any exterior authority. This conception of the rights and functions of a Governor is sanctioned by the practice of thousands of years, and is as much an article in the creed of the oppressed as of the oppressors. It will have to be destroyed an( i the motive force must come from the European. The Persian talks' of r ) U re -handed administration, but it forms no part of his dreams, and in the depths of his mind he only thinks of it as a thing to be enforced on his enemies, not on himself or his friends. One European up against the hosts ot darkness and supported only by dishonest Persians can hope to make but slow rooress. His enforcement of Government's rights is a thing which touches an^offends almost everyone, and which is not balanced by the small and un known amount of restraint which his presence may exercise on the peculations and exactions of his Persian colleagues in other departments. In the early stages of reform the personality of the reformer is almost every thing, and the nature of the reforms is of minor importance. Mr. Lecoffre has courage, determination, industry and considerable knowledge and astuteness, and these are all to his credit. On the other hand he is vain, . self- centred, aloof, indeed almost a recluse, and entirely lacking in a sense of humour and hon homme- He has the air of a man of only one idea and the wild eyes and manner of a madman. These qualities, in Persia, constitute very serious defects. Mr. Lecoffre is also a visionary and a theorist. As in this he resembles many reformers past and present, criticism is dangerous, but he is a visionary and a theorist in a hurry and under the power of extraneous influences. As the Amir Mufakham once remarked with some degree of truth, he wants to be King of Kerman ; but he does not want to stay long in Kerman, and is not prepared to test the truth of the saying that everything comes to him who waits. An undoubted error on Mr. Lecoffre's part is his readiness to have recourse to Persian ruses and expedients, of which he has made no secret to His Maiesty's Consul. He believes in the ready lie that turneth away wrath, and he does not hesitate to bluster and employ threats which he knows he cannot fulfil. Eor months before their arrival he used the gendarmerie as a bugbear and bogey which was going to dance to his piping, and he actually telegraphed to their commandant to bring in by force the Deputy Governor of Eafsinjan, the Amir Mufakham's nephew, though he says he never really meant this to be done. By such methods he sells his birth right and chief asset, the reputation as a European for sincerity and straightness. The loss will not be made good even by his giving out in the bazaar that he is a ' very blood thirsty little fellow.'* It will not be judged unnatural that Mr. Lecoffre failed to win for himself a position in the affections of the Amir Mufakham, a man who, with certain good qualities, possessed all the ordinary desire of a Persian Governor for wealth, and who shared Mr. Lecoffre's sense of hurry and inability to wait. In all other respects these two men were the points of contact of two opposing principles. More serious is Mr. Lecoffre's failure to gain, even in a small degree, the affection of the public. His task is in many ways an unpopu lar one, but this would not in itself have been fatal. It is his haughty manner, unsympathetic nature and inaccessibility which have really handicapped him. Did he not know his Persia and his Persians well the case would have been even worse, but he does not as a rule set up impossible standards, and he does display some practical reasonableness. On his first arrival he had to reorganise the office which was in confusion and to deal with the Amir Mufakham's demands and accounts After that he was able to devote himself to the problem of collecting, m part directly and in part through the Amir, the revenues of the province. The Eevenue Department is now represented by special agents in all the districts, who collect what revenue they can, either through the ordinary Kadkhudas holding their appointments from the Governor, or through other Kadkhudas specially appointed by the Department for its own work. This transfer of the revenue work from the Government Kadkhudas (who were in some cases tound unsatisfactory) to special nominees of the Department was one of the causes of the Amir Mufakham's numerous complaints.I; 11 62 PEESIAN GULP ADMINISTRATION REPORT The folio Trins^ is a statement of the revenue due for the year 191341 and of that actually collected and expected to be collected : REVENUE OF THE PROVINCE OP KERMAN, EXCLUSIVE OF BALUCHISTAN Total Annual Demand.

' The amount of reductions to be granted will not be less than 25,000 tomans—a clear loss to Government. These reductions may be divided under the heads :— 1. Impoverished or dispersed tribes. 2. Pillage and looting of Baluchis. 3. Collected in excess by former Governors during last two years' With reference to the Amir Mufakham's expedition the following note by Mr. Lecoffre is of interest.

Another portion of this sum was discreetly passed over and accepted as irre coverable by the Amir and the farmers.' In August, after the Amir Mufakham's return, Mr. Lecoffre found time to turn his attention to other matters, and he announced the impending introduc tion of the ct Nawaqil' (animal and vehicle) taxes, and issued orders for the resumption of Government lands in the town which had been appropriatedi TOE THE TEAK 1913 63 Without proper authority by private persons.

His Majesty's Consul received instructions from His Majesty's Minister that British subjects and were not to pay these taxes. Mr. Lecoffre was informed accordingly ^and no demand has been made on Europeans. It may be remarked that the Nawaqn &amp;rXarrTval ^ and in 0 P eration before 2 As regards the order for the resumption of State lands, no very drastic action appears to have been taken on it as there has been no general outcry on til6 fLlDj'OL. * Mr. Lecoffre, in the autumn received from Tehran copies of very stringent regulations for the examination of carpets with a view to suppressing the use of aniline dyes. He has very wisely not attempted to put them in force. Little aniline is used in the manufacture of the ' Kerman carpet' of export and the enforcement of the regulations would demand the services of an expert chemist with a considerable staff. Amlme, probably imported via Pars, is largely used by theAfshar nomads m the rugs which they weave and which are now be- coming an article of export to America and-Europe. Mr. Lecoffre, who has a fertile and daring mind, produced during the year a number of schemes for the better administration of the province e .o. Gov- ernment by a cabinet consisting principally of himself and other selected Europeans with a figure head Governor; the reconquest and reorganisation of Baluchistan under his own supervision as Chief Political Officer ; a tribal coun cil for managing the affairs of the tribes; and the placing of the City Police under European control. ^ ^ Before their arrival he counted on extracting much service from the een- darmene, but in this he has been disappointed. L , E® said at the end of the year that he had obtained orders from Tehran for A® 7 1. ? if be P laced uader tlle supervision of the Swedish Gendarme Omcers, but the latter did not quite support this statement. The institution of a force of Persian Gendarmerie under Swedish Officers The Gendarmerie. was second great innovation of the year. In view of the long-continued insecurity of the trade routes in the Kerman Province, the India Office, m the month of May, proposed that a force for the protection of the Bandar Abbas road should be organised under British Officers The proposal was acquiesced in by the Foreign Office. Strong obiection to it was however raised by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran on the grounds that it would be resented by the Persian Government, and shortly afterwards it was announced that the Persian Government was prepared to extend the system of gendarmerie to Kerman. Upon this His Majesty's Secretary of State for tomgu Affairs decided not to press the proposal for the employment of British Officers further for the time being. Prom the purely local Kerman point of view it is much to be regretted that the original proposal was not adhered to It would have been regarded by the population as the natural and reasonable tmng tor us to do. And the proof that we are actually prepared to take effect ive action in the defence of our rights and interests would have raised our pres tige immensely throughout the whole province and so have rendered easier in many ways the protection of these rights and interests. British Officers would nave been more efficient and personally popular than the Swedes who have been deputed here appear ever likely to become. It is to be remembered that, wnile the pick of the officers of the Indian Army, with experience on the right lines would have been available, only a few of the officers of the Swedish Army are likely to find service under the Persian Government attractive. It will do Jiem no good in their own home service. The result is that, in general, we only hope to get an inferior type of Swedish Officer, who in no case can ave had any useful experience. This is likely seriously to handicap the effi- icncy and popularity of the force raised while adding largely to the difficulties64 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT of His Majesty's Consulate, which is saddled with the task of ' smoothing' ove^' , all difficulties arising between the gendarmerie and the authorities and people of the province. The policing of the Bandar Abbas road, granted sufficient funds, should not however in itself be a very difficult business. The nucleus force of gendarmerie arrived from Tehran on October 24itli. It was constituted as follows :— 1 Swedish Commandant Major G-. Glimstedt (of the Swedish Eegular Army). 1 „ &lt;c Intendant' „ Lychnell „ „ (Quartermaster) 1 „ Cavalry Officer Captain deMare (of the Swedish Reserve). 1 „ Infantry Officer „ Oertingren (^'policeman.') About 9 Persian Officers, including a Doctor. „ 200 rank and file, Northern Persians, of whom about 150 were said to be fighting men. Up to the end of the year the force was handicapped by both Major Glimstedt and Captain Oertingren being laid up with enteric fever, while the other two officers were at first frequently indisposed. Besides this Major Lychnell and Captain Oertingren are quite new arrivals in the country, and know no Persian and extremely little French or English. None of the officers have had any experience of the East or Easterns, and their knowledge of Persian feeling and modes of thought and of the conditions of the country acquired in Tehran is slight. Mentally they are not brilliantly endowed, and they are inclined to be hasty and headstrong in action. They have therefore much to learn, and they have but a short time to do it in, as Glimstedt's and de Mare's contracts expire it is believed within a year, and the former at any rate will have to proceed to Sweden to undergo his examinations for promotion. It would be foolish at present to prophesy either hard or soft things regarding the future of the gendarmerie. With all their defects, which exceed those mentioned, the Swedes are men, know their own minds, and intend to be obeyed, and are keen on their work, but they are neither wise as serpents nor harmless as doves. They have made some progress with recruiting, and the strength of the force at the end of the year was about 270. Whether they have succeeded in tapping good material, on which much will depend, is not yet known, and in any case they have not had enough officers available to effect much in the way of training. They contemplate moving down to Bandar Abbas in full force early in spring, with single-fly tents and no sun hats. If they do not perish en route of starvation, or sunstroke, they will return with a Swedish Nursing Sister and a Swedish Doctor, who is at present studying Tropical Medicine in Paris. His Majesty's Consul has proffered such counsel on these and other matters as he could without offence. His personal relations with the Swedes are excellent. The Karguzari was in the charge of Mirza Habibullah Khan, Acting The Earguzari. Karguzar, throughout the year He is an able and hardworking man, with a very thorough knowledge of Kerman. He has frequently officiated as Karguzar, during the last twenty years or so, and is always de ficto Karguzar, as no new-comer can carry on without his help. He is not all that could be desired in the way of honesty, and was an object of special aversion to the Imperial Bank of Persia's ruling genius, Mirza Mustafa Khan. The result of these two circumstances was that his conduct of certain cases in the latter part of 1912 was not entirely satisfactory, but he has worked well for the Consulate during the past year, and, judged as Karguzars go, His Majesty's Consul is disposed to regard him favourably. Early in the year it was announced that a permanent Karguzar was to be sent from Sistan, but he never came and, in May, information was received fwm His Majesty's Legation that a certain Wasiq-us-Sultaneh in the Foreign Office in Tehran had been appointed. He also, however, did not put in an appearance.FOR THE YEAR 1913. 65 In his early days Mr. Bruggmann, Agent of the Persian Carpet Company (German), announced his intention of ousting Mirza Habibullah Khan, but he aid not make good his threat. Charge of the Russian Consulate was held throughout the year by the The Russian Consulate. Consul, Dr. Chiriaieff. He has talked continuously of his approaching relief, but, though a young Russian doctor arrived in December, there were no signs of a new Consul. Kerman has, it would seem, a very bad name in the Russian services, though it would be a paradise for a Russian in search of rest in a good climate. The only affair in which the Russian Consulate played an important part was the case of jVdirza Ali IVluhammad, IVTujtahid. Otherwise, beyond occasionally harbouring malcontents and then doing nothing for them, it was io all appearance quite inert, partly perhaps the result of Doctor Chiriaieff's being something of a chronic invalid, and a confirmed recluse. Relations between the Russian and Brit^.h Consulates and Consuls were entirely friendly throughout the year. Soon after his arrival, His Majesty's Consul's attention was attracted by Arms Traffic preceedings of a gang of Baluchis who were registered in the Consulate as British subjects, irequent complaints were brought against them of swindling, and it ^as found that they made their livelihood mainly by trafficking in arms. The case was made worse by the fact that they were in close intimacy with the Consulate (clerk, who posed as their patron, and was the son-in-law of one of their number. This clerk, with a ^ disreputable Persian friend, had carried on negotiations on behalf of the Amir Mufakham for the purchase of arms in Ispahan, without the knowledge of the Acting Consul, Mr. Newman of the ImperialfBank of Persia, and the Baluch is were the active agents in the business. In the end the boxes of ammunition purchased were found, on arrival at Yezd, to contain stones But it is unnecessary to pursue this story. Ascertaining that the Baluchis were thoroughly bad characters, His Majesty's Consul ob tained permission to take action under the Persian Coast and Islands'Order in Council, and proceeded to demand heavy security from them not to engage in further dealing in arms. On their failing to produce the required security he passed an order of deportation against them. Some difficulty was experienced in putting it into effect as they had large outstanding debts, and succeeded in making away with various assets, including arms, which they were known to possess They were however eventually able to satisfy their creditors, and left for Bandar Abbas under Persian escort, en route to Karachi. The whole business gave much trouble, and took nearly four months to bring to a termi nation. It is believed that the British nationality of some of the seven men deported was questionable, and that they had originally been registered in the Consulate at the instance of the clerk with a view to enjoying its (unconscious) protection in their various nefarious practices—arms dealing, cheating, and forging 4t sanads' for claims. Had they been officially Afghans and not British Indians, it is very unlikely that they would have come to erief and been deported. While this was going on, a party of Sistanis were arrested at Bam for carrying contraband opium, and were deprived of a number of rifles which they had in their possession. They denied their guilt, took 44 bast 'in the Telegraph Office, and claimed to be entitled to British protection. On investi gation it was found that two of their number had old rahdaris ' from His Majesty's Consulate, Sistan, certifying that they were in the employment of British Indian subjects and entitled to assistance. Eor these two men His Majesty's Consul obtained the restoration of the bulk of their property. This party appears to be one which had had dealings with the Baluchis, subse quently deported, in Kerman, and had claimed the help of His Majesty's Consul in this and other dubious transactions. Later other Sistanis turned up armed with similar credentials. His Majesty's Consul, who had already been in communication with His Majesty's Consul, Sistan, again referred to that officer, who asked that the documents66 PEESIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT should be confiscated. This, however, was not possible as the holders of the had in the meantime disappeared. His Majesty's Consul, Sistan, wno was no way responsible for these certificates, which were old, expressed his intentio 11 of strictly supervising the issue of such documents in the future. Sistanis no doubt, do actually work for British Indian traders in Sistan, but their main object in coming to Kerman appears to be to deal (presumably on their own account) in bad ghee, arms, and opium 'sukhtah, ' in which they are muck assisted by being able to pose as British proteges. The commercial conditions of the year were not unfavourable, but there Commercial was ai1 inlieritailce trouble from 1912 in several difficult bankruptcy cases, in which the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Hindus were creditors. These cases had fallen into a state of great confusion, but were brought into some degree of order during the year, though they still remained unsettled and are likely to remain so for some time to come. During the year the security of the routes was in general satisfactory, but there were unhappily a few serious outrages. The robbery of large caravans at Sarvistan and Marghak by Baluchis has been already mentioned. This robbery was followed by that of a large carpet caravan at Daulatabad, on the Pars border. Portunately, thanks perhaps to action by the Amir Mufakham, the greater part of the property was at once recovered. The Kawam-ul-Mulk has since led an expedition to Darab to secure the restoration of the residue, but, s far as is at present known, he has suffered defeat and is unlikely to be successful. During the year the Consulate had to deal with some five fresh robberies but the number of claims involved considerably exceeds that of the robberies. In the way of recoveries the year was a red-letter one, though that, as will be seen, means little. Eecoveries aggregating 16,068 Krans were actually effected by the Amir Mufakham in regard to three robbery cases, and one of these was settled, albeit only on the basis of a compromise. Such results, it would seem, are without precedent in the records of the Consulate during the last ten years.

The number of cases outstanding on 31st December 1913 was therefore actually 38 of a value of about Krs 1,121,467. It is impossible to state the total monetary value of the claims exactly, as in some cases claims have been lodged for goods the value of which is not specified. Of the 5 remaining 'fresh cases' the settlement of is in prosress or is promised. 1 5 Besides suffering from the bad faith of Persian debtors and the corrupt- ness of Persian officials, added to highway robberies and the helplessness of the authorities, trade in Kerman is hampered by several more easily removable ■causes. PostalService. Theflrst pf these is] a slow, irregular and untrustworthv postal service—The matter is receiving His Majesty's Consul's attention and it is hoped early in the ensuing year to put up a case for the re-organisa- tion and reformation of the Postal Service which it will be impossible for the responsible authorities to neglect. Telegraphs.—The second is the absence of direct uhm betvveen Kerman and Bandar Abbas. At present telegrams sent have to pass over the submarine cable and are charged at the rate of S 1 E&gt;ar^ {about Re. 1) per word. 2 A demand for a direct land line has bfeen officially submitted by His Maies- ty s Consul It has been favourably received by His Majesty's Minister the Telegraph Authorities m Persia and the Persian Foreign Minister, but it is at present meeting with opposition from some quarter in London. ' It is honed ^hat this may soon be overcome ^ Banking—A. third cause of inconvenience is the absence of all Banking facilities at Bandar Abbas A recommendation that the Imperial Bank of Persia should be pressed to open a branch there has been put in by His Maiestv's Consul. It is understood that all the local Managers of the Imperial Bank of Persia in the Gulf expressed themselves last year in favour of such a step The prospects of a general improvement in the commercial conditions of Kerman in the coming year are not altogether gloomy. It is hoped thai in course of time, the gendarmerie may prove effective in putting a stop to brigandage on the main trade route, that connecting Kerman with Bandar Abbas Praudulent debtors and bankrupts have been run hard during the past year. The most notorious, one Ali Asghar Khoi, fled from Kerman in Pebru- ary, only to be arrested in Tehran, where he has been kept under restraint or a sort ever since. His father, who was implicated, was forced to come to ienran rrom Tabriz, and proceedings have been taken against them under the auspices of His Majesty's Legation. Had the man stayed in Kerman and made enort to pay up, he and his family would have passed a much happier year. The debtors Kausian have been so harassed that they are sick of life and iiusam Kuli Khamnai, after making some measure of restoration, found life so strenuous in Kerman that he absconded. As there was little hope of obtaining further satisfaction from him it was not considered worth while to pursue him. Continuous pressure was kept up on the unwilling authorities until they oun it expedient to take effective action against some of the Kausians' more important debtors and so recover some of the assets of the firm. In none of these instances have the pecuniary results, at least as yet, been very stnkmg, but it is believed that this relentless harrying of the fraudulent 11 nave an excellent moral effect a^d serve to deter many from following m their footsteps. If robberies are stopped, fraud restrained within reasonable limits, the L\ a . s ™ re ^ ormecl ; direct telegraphic communication witb Bandar Abbas a lisiied, and banking facilities provided at that place, the commercial munity of Kerman will not have much reason left for complaint. k Z68 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT —The question of the Trans-Perdan Eailway was a subject of much attention in the earlier part of the year Mr. W. A Johns, C.I E , of ,, _ T . , . t w the Public Works Department, and Mr g' FT British Interests and Institutions. ^ p n i • i a ■ 1:, - Tipper, of the beological Survey of India, were deputed by the Indian Government to examine the course of the best alignment between Karachi and Kerman, and to renort on the mineral resour- ces of the country through which it would pass. At least this was inferred, for no notice or information regarding the mission was received by His Majesty's Consul The two officers just mentioned arrived at Kerman, on January 19th, having travelled up through Baluchistan via Geh and Bam. They examined the country round Kcrman and, in particular, the principal reprrtecl sites of coal and other mineral deposits Mr. Tipper failed to find any miiie- ral deposits of commercial value. Coal was only found in small quantities and of poor quality. Search for a practicable alignment for a railway towar s Bandar Abbas over the mountains from the Deh Bakri Pass westwards to Baft was equally unsuccessful. Mr. Johns was understood to have reported in favour of an alignment from Ispahan via Yezd to Kerman and thence via Bam past the south-west of Masitabad, Bampur, Geh, Chahbar, and thence along, or fairly close to, the coast to Karachi Feeder lines were proposed— (1) Erom Masitabad into Jiruft. (2) From Masitabad to Bandar Abbas. (3) From Bampur to Nusratabad, Sistan. (4) From Pasni to Kej and Pishin. It is understood, however, that His Majesty's Government has vetoed such an alignment and is holding out for one from Ispahan via Shiraz to Bushire or Bandar Abbas. To the writer it appears that what the economic neecls of Persia demand regarding lines connecting the chief inland trade centres with the nearest parts on the coast, the principle which indeed underlies the Hamadan, Khurramabad, Mohammerah scheme A similar line from Kerman to Bandar Abbas would act as a conduit for the trade of most of Eastern Persia, including in a measure Khorasan, and would appear to be free from most of the strategic drawbacks of a line striking the coast further east. It would probably lead to a great economic development in the parts of the province that are capable of becoming productive, snch as Jiruft, and would put a termination to the lawless condi tions of the country between Kerman and Bandar Abbas in a w T ay that sub sidising the Persian Government may fail to do. For the meantime Kerman appears to be far removed from any hope of railways. Proposed Mining Concession —During the first half of the year negotia tions were also being carried on by British financiers with a view to obtaining a concession for the exploitation of the mineral resources of parts of Kerman and the adjoining provinces. The proposed area of the concession was limited on the north by a line connecting Abadeh (between Yezdikhast and Dehbid) and JSeh, on the west by a line running due south from Abadeh, on the east by a line running south from JNeh following the 60th degree of east longi tude and on the south by a line following the outline of the coast and 40 miles inland from it. Difficulties have been experienced in settling the exact terms of the con cessions, and the question of a loan, which it was proposed should be made to the Persian Government by the concessionaires, and claims raised by those interested in the Trans-Persian Eailway scheme to rights in all mineral supplies situated along the course of their proposed alignment, further complicated matters No settlement appears to have been arrived at before the expiry of the year. Mr. Tipper's unfavourable report on the reputed mineral deposits of Kerman throws some doubt on the commercial value of the concession. Indo-European Telegraph Department. —In March the Superintendent, Mr J. W. Tanner, paid a visit to Shurgaz, wherelthe line at present crosses a large torrent bed, and is liable to be swept aw r ay whenever a flood comes. 1 6 only remedy was found to be to make a diversion, and accordingly a new si e for carrying the wires across the torrent bed was selected. Since then, time bas been occupied in discussing the nature of the material to be employed, and it is improbablo that work will be commenced before next November.FOR THE YEAR 1913. 69, The Telegraph Office at Tahrnd was plundered by BalueMs in May Mi- Tanner further reports 'Last August an Afghan caravan smashed nine insulators near Garmac and did otter damage. As the Afghans are generally well armed and numerous we are helpless against them, and the only hope of stoppins; their depredations is to have them stopped as thoy cross the border into AMiaiiistan But at present the Persians have no force for such a project A Sistani lashkar also did considerable damage to the line in October 1913 The matter was reported to the British Consul, Sistan, but I have not been informed if any action was taken on the report.' As regards the arrangemeats for protecting the line in Baluchistan, he makes the following ravourable report :— ' With the aid of Mr. Lecoffre, we have been able to put the smard supplied by the Persian Government for the lines in Baluchistan on a better footing as regards pay. Rifles and ammunition have also been issued to them also brass ' nishans ' to enable them to be identified. The members of the Nahrui tribe, under Alishah Khan, and Taj Muhammad Khan, who have been deputed to guard the line between Bam and the frontier, are doing very well and we are satisfied with them . ' « By mears of these men we are able to get into touch with other Baluchi tribes, and in this way we have more than once been able to recover articles and animals that have been stolen from our people. Their influence is also making itself felt in the reduction of wilful damage +o the line. Certain Afghan caravans are the greatest sinners in this respect now.' The following is his report on the telegraphic work of the Department during the year :— ' Messages, both forwarded and received, and both International and local, show a decrease as compared with 1912. As the local rates have been lowered' the receipts payable to the Persian Telegraph Administration show a considerable decrease. ' Imperial Bank of Persia —The Bank gave much work to His Maiesty's Consulate during the first part of the year. They had been conducting certain large bankruptcy cases on behalf of themselves and the Hindu creditors, and they had allowed these cases to get into a state of great confusion. The Bank Mirza, Mustafa Khan, had, in 1912, been appointed official representative not only of the Bank, but also of the Hindus and of His Majesty's Consulate, and for many months he naturally managed all affairs concerned with them, his views and recommendations being in all cases adopted Being a Persian he, of course, abused his position, and there is satisfactory evidence that he was' positively dishonest in several instances. In March, the Managar, Mr. Newman, was transferred to Tehran makin^ over chaige to the Accountant, Mr. Gardner, i ortunately charge was again transferred to Mr. A. Wright in June. Mr. Wright has spent an enormous amount of labour in trying to get things into order and has to a large extent succeeded. He is now under orders again for Yezd, which is much to be regretted. Strengthened by evidence obtained by Mr. Wright, His Majesty's Consul deprived Mirza Mustafa Khan of the authority which he had held for a year on +1? t F Consulate and Hindus. He has also strongly recommended that the Bank should remove the man from Kerman and has informed them that he i T? C ^ ne i n any way to recognise him. Mirza Mustafa was not only dishonest, but also extremely tactless and was on the worst of terms with all the local officials. f +1 Ma 3 est y' s Consul has further insisted on the Hindus appointing an agent ii +U 1 • 0W:,1 * alwa y s see ^ to others, the Bank or the Consulate, to pull their chesnuts out of the fire for them, and then complain that they have been swindled. ^e Hindus. —The Hindus have carried on their business, it is believed, profit. They are now more cautious in their dealings with Persians. The70 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT failure of the Parsees, e.g , Kausian, has left them an almost clear field in th import business. They were, however, the chief sufferers by robbery during the year. They entered fresh claims on account of bad debts for Krans 22,678 of which, however, 13,280 was recovered before the end of the year. Church Missionary Society. —There was a considerable change in the staff during the year, and some signs of activity. The Reverend A. Boylan arrived in November and proceeded to organise a school. The medical work was carried on by Dr. Schaffter and Dr. (Miss) 'Westlake and Miss Oarrick, Nurse till autumn, when Dr. Schaffter went to Yezd. He was followed by Miss Carrick in December. Dr. Dodson came out from leave in November. The following are the statistics of the medical work done during the year :— In-patients . , , . . , . .469 Out-patients ........ 4,981 Repeated visits of out-patients ..... 12^042 Patients visited in the city . .... 1,527 Patients visited on itineration . . , . . 475 Major operations .... . 377 Minor „ « . . . . Not recorded. Nothing unusual in the medical history of the year. JEastefn Rug and Trading Company. —This concern, registered as a British Company, maintained its lead among the carpet firms Prices rose owing to the increase of competition due to the establishment of the German Company, the Persische Teppich Aktiens Gesellschaft, and the arrival of three new agents of American firms, but had fallen nearly to normal again by the end of the year. Export is still chiefly to America, but the European demand is steadily increas ing. The export of carpets for the year was probably a record maximum, but there are large unsold stocks in London and Constantinople. It was arranged that the Company should be merged in the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Limited, whose head office is in Smyrna, with effect from the 1st of the new year. The latter concern has a big capital £1,000,000 and does a big business but is said to have sunk so much capital in buildings and stock that it is in rather a critical financial position. Castelli fy Co. —This firm shows signs of decline and, towards the end of Foreign interests. S' 3 y ear ' its agency was left in charge of a Persian, the notorious Hussainoff. The Kazan Company —The Agent of this American firm, Pandelis Josephides, was discovered to have been engaged with Ali Asghar Khoi in defrauding the latter's creditors. He was also detected in other dishonest practices. At His Majesty's Consul's instance His Majesty's Legation withdrew British protection from the firm in Kerman. The JPersische Teppich Aktiens Gesellschaft. —An agency of this company was opened at Kerman in January by Mr. G. Bruggmann, a Swiss subject. No arrangements had been made by the firm for Consular protection, and Mr. Bruggmann went about saying that he was himself going to be appointed German Vice-Consul. He began operations by some rather sharp ancl un- gentlemanly practices towards the Eastern Eug and Trading Co., whose guest he then was. Thereafter he appears to have quarrelled with every one he had dealings with, the Karguzar, whom he tried to browbeat; his employes, who accused him of assaulting them, and his servants who would not stay with him. European society he entirely eschewed and there was no quarter in which, for one reason or another, he was not extremely unpopular. In August His Majesty's Consul received instructions to extend British protection to him, andpersian gulf administration report The following Europeans vi s ite d Kerman during the year :— Arrived from Left for B usiuess.

The suggestion wasj adopted. Mr, Garnett was able to convey the Legation's views of their respective func tions and positions to Mr. Lecoffre and the Swedish officers, and also to discuss other matters of political importance. [Note, —The unusual length of this report may perhaps be justified on the grounds, firstly, that no full conspectus of British interests and of the work of His Britannic Majesty's Consulate in this quarter of the 'British Sphere' of Persia appears ever to have been given in the past, and secondly, that the vear under review has seen the introduction of several important developments in the administration of the province, wh ch may have far-reaching effects on British interests.)

ADMINISTRATION REPOKT FOR THE PERSIAN MEKRAN COAST FOR THE YEAR 1913. Mr. E. E. Gunter held Political charge of the Mekran Coast throughout the year. An account of the importation of the arms and ammunition into Mekran forms the subject of separate reports. In spite of the blockade of the Mekran Coast by His Majesty's war-vessels, the Baluchis succeeded in importing 1,963 rifles with a corresponding quantity of ammunition which shows an increase of 1,175 rifles in comparison with the number imported during 1912. As in 1912, the Afghans confined themselves in collecting arms in the country, the majority obtained in Karwan, which appears to be the centre of the trade. A greater part of the consignments were landed in the territory of Sirdar Islam Khan.

GUNTER, Director, Karachi ; Persian Gulf Telegraphs, The 2ht April 1914. In Political Charge, Mekran Coast, F. D.78 PERSIAN GXJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT ME. F PINSENT'S REPOET ON TEIE CONDITION OP THE COTJNrEY BETWEEN J ASK AND GWADUE. Mir Haji continues to be the recognised chief of the greater portion of T} ., , . , this district. The relationship between la m 18 ric ' Mirs Haji and Barkat has been a deal more cordial during the past year, though it is said that the latter has not as yet forgotten the treacherous murder of his brother Muhammaduk by the former's men towards the end of July 1912. Outwardly these two chiefs are friendly, and a part of the district (between Kuh Mubarak and Karai creek) has been given to Barkat by Mir Haji, but in spite of this there is always likely to be a certain amount of ill-feeling on the part of Barkat who, according to Baluch custom, feels that it is his duty to avenge his brother's death. This may be the cause of trouble in these parts sooner or later unless Mir Haji takes proper steps to reconcile Barkat and gets him to forget the incident. I am given to understand that the Persian Government has not as yet recognised Barkat's return as chief of the portion of this district. One Saiyid Abdul Eahim of Go wan has been looting and oppressing the people under his care, and Mir Barkat asked me to have the rifles presented to the Saiyid by Major Craufurd recalled. I referred the matter to Major Murphy, the present Intelligence Officer, and also forwarded a letter from chis chief to that officer on the subject. In November last Mir Barkat left old Jask with the intention of settling matters with this Saiyid, but up to date no information regarding the result has as yet reached me. I believe the rifles were given to Saiyid Abdul Eahim as a means of protection against Earkat who, last year, was guilty of many raids in different parts of the district round about Jask. The Jask district under Mir Mustafa Khan and Mir Hoti has been quiet T v tv, f • i. during the year, with the exception of an * ^ attempt on the life of Chiragh, Mustafa Khan's eldest son; no serious disturbances have occurred. This is due to the fact of Mir Barkat having completely given up raiding and oppressing the people and also, from what I can gather from different sources, it can be assumed that no further trouble in the future need be expected from him. After his record of the past few years, Barkat's conduct during the period under report has been exemplary, from being the oppressor of the poor he has turned round and severely deals with any one who acts unjustly. This, undoubtedly, is due to his desire of reconciling himself with our Government, from whom he is very anxious to receive pardon for past misdeeds and, should this act of grace on our part be extended to him, I do not think it will be a matter of regret to us at any time. In my interview with Barkat, on the 12th October last, I found him very courteous, besides he appeared to be keen on settling his affairs with us and he promised faithfully to pay up the Eupees 5,000 security demanded within a very short time. My advice to him was to deposit the amount he had collected up to date with the Clerk in Charge of Jask Station in order to show that an effort on his part was being made to get the money together. On the 31st October Barkat sent his Wazir to Jask with Es. 1,200 and Krans 8,050 and this amount is now in deposit pending receipt of the balance when this chief hopes to receive his pardon from our Government. Krans 350 is approximately the equivalent of Es 100. Mir Barkat is still very suspicious ; no inducement on my part could get him to visit me at Jask or even enter the station limits at that place, his excuse being that a few years ago the Persians captured and deported him to Bushire and he begged me to excuse him, adding he had not forgotten the experiences and trials he underwent at the hands of the Persian Government when last he came near our station. From the following which accompanied Barkat to my camp it is apparent that he does not trust us. Over a hundred well armed men sat round the tent in which the interview was held, and the chiei himself refused refreshments until I assured him that no design on his life was intended. Even after my assurances he allowed several of the headmen present to partake of tea, etc., and it was only after an interval of half an hour that he consented to join in the hospitality. Barkat states he is preventingFOE THE TEAR 1913. 79 tlie importation of arms in his district to his utmost power; has entirely ceased to engage m the slave traffic with the Arab Coast; has come to terms with the people at old J ask, and is reconciled to Mir Haii of Biaban • but he oarnnf agree to reside withm 24 hours, call of Jask as he has large interests to look after at Bashkard and other places. He is agreeable to come in when sum- moned and asks for three days, notice, which I consider is a reasonable proposal on his part. r r Prom reports receiyed it would appear that Illai Khan, the headman of the Anguran district (Bashkard) died some time early in August, and it is the intention of Mir Barkat to make an eftort to get himself appointed in the place of the deceased. All the people of the district are agreeable and welcome him as their chief, but the relations of the deceased headman, particularly the son Muhammad Khan Illai, view his attempts with great disfavour, and probably this will lead to trouble in that place. Barkat has every hope of the Persian Government assisting and recognising him in the near future as chief of Acguran. One G-huIam Husain, a Baluchi of some standing and recently Wazir to the late Illai Khan of Anguran, also an intimate friend of Mir Barkat's a year or two ago, while attempting to collect revenue in October last had a disagree ment with some villagers which resulted in a few shots being exchanged between the parties and the death of a slave belonging to Ghulam Husain This man and Mir Barkat are not on terms now owing to Ghulam Husain siding with the late Illai Khan's son with regard to the chieftainship of the district, and it is Barkat's intention to deal most severely with him on his return to Bashkard. Mir Ghiragh, the eldest son of Mustafa Khan, in attempting to prevent the passage of arms at the end of October 1912 in which two Karwanis were killed has resulted in a blood feud. Ghulam Shah, the father of one of the men shot dead in the affray, is now residing in the Karwan district and is determind to be avenged. This man made an unsuccessful attempt to murder Ohiragh on the night of the 12th June last, but in the confusion and darkness the attackers, consisting of Ghulam Shah and five others, Mistook the house and did some damage to another resident of Yekdar. The raiders after setting fire to the house, retreated and have made no further attempts on Ohiragh's life up to date. In this affair one of our line Jemadars had a camel killed and a lineguard lost a goat, both animals being shot, and the owner of the house, besides haying his place destroyed and barely escaping with his life, lost a number of go^ts which were burned to death. Sirdar Saiyid Khan, the chief of Gaih, has been at Bampur during the (raih District. greater part^ of the year managing that district, it is said, in the interests of the Persian Government but, early in November last, he left for Gaih fort in order to attend the marriage ceremonies of some of his near connections, and has sent Islam Khan to represent him at that place. Rumours have reached the Coast to the effect that the Persians are coming down in force to Bampur assisted by European officers (probably the Swedish Gendarmerie) and this is more likely the reason why Saiyid Khan vacated in favour of Islam Khan. A deal of jealousy exists on the part of Saiyid Khan with regard to the chief of Bint. The latter has of late become a great deal more powerful than the former chief considers safe, and it is said that the ruler of Gaih will find Islam Khan a very difficult person to deal with in the near future, and the only reason why he has been allowed to act at Bampur is in the hopes of the Per sian Government breaking him as this chief foolishly intends resisting the coming of the Persians. Saiyid Khan, assisted by Bahram Khan during the earlier part of the year, had several small fights with Nawab Khan, in which the latter lost one of his sons and serveral slaves who were killed. Bahram Khan is now acting as a go-between, and it is hoped a reconciliation will be effected shortly. Islam Khan of Bint, in April last, raided Balak owing to the people refusing as he said to pay taxes and behaved with great harshness to the inhabitants, looting every one of practically all their possessions. In this aixair one of our patrols named Shah Beg suffered considerably. It Was80 PERSIAN GULT 1 ADMINISTRATION REPORT Islam Khan's intention after raiding Balak to proceed to Bir and act in the same high-handed manner but, owing to the determined stand made by the people of the place, he abandoned the attempt and retired on Bint, but he has not forgotten the incident and will sooner or later wreak his vengeance on the people who attempted to oppose his advance. Hot Faqir Muhammad of Parag, a headman in the receipt of an annual subsidy of Rs. 150 from our Department, was murdered on the night of the 10th August last, thus removing a strong man who always worked in our interests and one who looked well after the line employes. The murder was committed by one Mirdil, a connection of the deceased, in revenge for the treatment he had received from Eaqir Muhammad, who had imprisoned him recently for stealing cattle belonging to the inhabitants of Parag. Small parties of Afghans have throughout the year been searching for arms in the Karwan and Bint districts ; it is also reported that caravans have left the country travelling north, but the number of Afghans and rifles accompanying them are greatly reduced. Mirs Mahmud Khan and Din Mahmud Khan continue to act as rulers of this district of Persian Baluchis- Dashtiari Disirict. tan and the relationship between these two Chiefs are a great deal more cordial than it has been for years. The latter, as he is getting older, appears to be getting more settled in his habits and gives his uncle (Mahmud Khan) the respect that is due to his age, consequently affairs in this district are generally satisfactory. On the 2nd of October last one Bahram Din Muhammad, a Eind from the Pishin district, created a little excitement by appearing a few miles off Charbar with a few followers and threatening to do for any British Indian subjects he met, and kidnapping the principal Hindu and Khoja representa tives at that port. It is believed an actual attempt of kidnapping was made by Bahram but, fortunately, it ended in a failure as the people of the Charbar baazar were on the alert, knowing it was the intention of this outlaw to do tbem some harm. After a day or two Bahram retired to Dashtiari, where his movements were lost sight of until the 24th November last, when it was reported at Charbar that he had left Kasserkand ten days previously and had let people know it was his intention to harm me or some of the people con nected with my camp. At the time of writing no information concerning the whereabouts of this man can be had, but it is generally believed he will quietly retire to his own district after a while and that his threats are all bluff. It is said that Bahram has been behaving in an unsettled manner for over a year a ad, in February last, looted five female camels from Tobo, in the Dasht district; three of the animals belonged to Sowar Nezar Muhammad of the Jask Sub-division's local escort. These were returned by Bahram on the payment of Ps 80 to the Sowar, who ,has now put in a claim for this amount. Sirdars Ashraf and AJimed Khan are the recognised rulers of this part of Baluchistan and, as far as the district Bahu District. i s concerned, nothing of any interest is available for record. Both chiefs are ruling quietly and, as the country is in a fairly flourishing condition, affairs are normal. One Hayatan, a ryot of Sirdar Ahmed's, has occasionally crossed the border into the Sultan of Maskat's territory and lifted some cattle belonging to the people round about there. This man is said to be a connection of Ahmed's, the chief's second wife being his daughter. The traffic in slaves between the Mekran and Arab coasts still continues, 01 though in a lesser degree than in previous 0 ra ^ years, but the buying and selling of slaves generally in the country is quite a recognised form of business. Seventeen male and thirteen female slaves were exported at different periods; the parti culars of each case are as follows:— (1) Nakhoda Bamzan of Khunarak left Rapch on the 13th January 1913 with four male and three female slaves. (2) Ali Khan Sharaf and Sahib Khan of Lashar, on the 15th January 1913, shippedFOE THE TEAR 1913. 81 ™ slav t es fr0m Tank.

ADMINISTRATION EEPOET FOE THE AHA BIST AN CONSULATE EOR THE YEAH 1913. Major L. B. H. Haworth, LA., held charge of the office of Consul through out the year, Captain A. J. H. Grey bein® His Majesty's Consulate. Vice-Consul at AhwaZ. Ijlal-es-Sultaneh, who took over the appointment of Governor of Arabistan during the previous year, continued a local officials. feeble rule. He is a pleasant man but weak, and typically Persian in his methods. He owed his continuance to the joint support of the Shaikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtiari Ilkhani. Ikram-ul-Mulk retained his post as Karguzar, which position is rather a sinecure in Mohammerah. The other various Persian appointments such as Eais-i-Zakhireh, Rais-i- Adlieh, the Master of Ordnance and the Chief Magistrate were vacant during the year. Shaikh Chasib, Nusrat-ul-Mulk, the Shaikh's eldest son, was Governor at Ahwaz and gave general dissatisfaction. He is hopelessly extravagant, always in difficulties for money and conse quently not too particular how he comes by it. Under an arrangement made with the Governor by the Shaikh and Sirdar-i-Jang, the Bakhtiari Ilkhani, the Deputy Governorship of Dizful was made a joint concern in charge of Imad-ed-Duftar, the Shaikh's representative, and Kutb-es Saadat, the Bakhtiari Ilkhani's. The arrangement worked fairly satisfactorily. In August, Monsieur Fourman, the Director of Customs, was transferred to Bandar Abbas, being relieved by Customs. Monsieur Bouckaert, the Director from Ahwaz. Monsieur van den Abeele, a new arrival, relieved Monsieur Bouckaert at Ahwaz. Monsieur Bouckaert has continued the work of his predecessor in improY- ing the Customs arrangements. He has opened regular registers in order to supply the information demanded by this Consulate and attempts to control his staff. The task is a difficult one since much of the work is necessarily in the hands of Persians and the temptations to fraud in Mohammerah are great, especially in the grain season. This last indeed is the chief problem since a tradition of dishonesty seems to have been set up among the employes of the Department in Mohammerah. The point of interest to British firms is to put a stop to the wholesale smuggling in the grain trade; in this smuggling the Germans are among the chief offenders causing a severe handicap to the British purchasers who do not descend to sucn measures. The Customs officials receive a proportion of the proceeds and thus the firms engaged in this work are enabled to save themselves as much as 25 per cent, of the duties and are in a position to offer proportionately higher prices for wheat and barley. His Majesty's Consul, after consultation with the British Chamber of Commerce, has demanded that the following two additional checks be added y the Customs. 1. That all ships shall deposit copies of their manifests at the Customs House for exports as well as imports. 2. That all Captains shall testify to the draft of their ship on arrival an on departure.Monsieur Bouckaert has shown himself amenable though at first it appeared as if the contrary was to be the case. Relations with him have been good. Monsieur van den Abeele appears to be a nonentity; there have been no complaints against him. uu 110 The open condition of the Customs premises has been the subject of cons- taut complairit, and the Department has now given a contract to Messrs Lvnch Brothers to fence in the enclosure. The godown accommodation is insufficient though the bmldmo; erected for the workshop for the Customs Preventive Service launches has been handed over for the purpose, Commandant Depiere bavins transferred tlie workshops to the customs ship Persepolis.' A question which is causing some trouble is that of Customs responsibility for goods on their wharfs and for which they have given receipts. The Customs Officers have already been mentioned and there remains only Commandant Depiere, the officer in Belgian Offioiala. ( charge of the Persian Customs Preventive Service. Monsieur Depiere, who speaks English well and was at first very friendly has shown signs of a pro-Eussian tendency, a tendency which is possibly trace able to personal causes. The only foreigners in Mohammerah are the Belgians the German company being represented by an Englishman. Members of British firms are not accustomed to meeting foreigners, a remark which applies more especially to such of their members as are of the type which hails from Glasgow, and accordingly they mix badly. Monsieur Depiere did not achieve either in Mohammerah or in Bushire, the social importance which he desired' and it is possibly this which has made him somewhat anti-English. He made^ the sailors of the 'Persepolis' do a certain amount of brick layers and building work in his house which resulted in a strike and may give the clue to an assault which was subsequently made on him, though he states his assailants were Arabs. The attack on Monsieur Constant caused considerable anxiety to all Belgians. On the 15th August, Monsieur Eourman and Monsieur Depiere were walk ing along the canal cat in the desert behind Mohammerah when they were attacked from behind by two Arabs carrying sticks. Monsieur Depiere received a nasty cut over the head and Monsieur Fourman was given a blow on the arm. The assailants then fled. Such an assault on Europeans, or for the matter of that on anybody, was a thing unknown in Arabistan and caused some excitement, while it increased the nervousness of the Belgians. There had been considerable friction between the Shaikh and the Customs Department owing to the undoubted tendency of the Belgian Administration to attempt to neglect the Shaikh's rights in Customs mutters and to encroach upon them whenever possible. The rights which the Shaikh possesses in Customs matters are among his most valuable assets, and mark definitely the difference between his territories and any other part of Persia. It accordingly became necessary for him to seize an occasion when the Customs had neglected his rights and to take up the question, point out the omission and refer to the rights and privileges which he possessed under Eoyal Such an opportunity was given on the appointment of a Persian Customs official. No notice had been given to the Shaikh, to whom all such appoint^ ments are required to be referred for approval and sanction. The man had been acting for some little time when the Shaikh pointed ont the irregularity and stated that, owing to his objections to him as an official, ne was unable to sanction his continuance in the department. The official objected to appeared to have been giving some trouble to the Shaikh's Arabs in M 284 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT an unnecessary way. In this matter His Majesty's Consul supported the Shaikh as it was most important from the British point of view that the rights of the Shaikh in such matters should be clearly marked. At first the Customs Director, though acknowledging the right of the Shaikh, refused to act as desired, and finally, the Shaikh, in his capacity as Director General of Customs, dismissed the offending individual on his own authority. A further case occurred in which Monsieur Eourman dismissed the Chief of the Shaikh's guards without referring the matter to the Shaikh first. Though it is possible that there may have been ground for complaint against this man, the action of the Director was highhanded and tactless. On the assault, to which I have referred, taking place the Belgians immediately ascribed it to the Shaikh's instigation. Eour days llater a further incident occurred in which some of the quarantine employes had a quarrel with the Captain of the Customs steam launch Mazanderan '. The dispute was due to the fact tha.t the Captain and his men had bathed naked near to the place where the women were in the habit of going to fetch their water. The ' Mazanderan ' was anchored near to the shore and, after reaching his ship, the Captain appears to have been roundly abused by men of the quarantine guard, fle immediately went on board the ' Persepolis' and, after seeing Captain Depiere, went ashore and waylaid one of the quarantine guards. A fracas resulted in the course of which one of the guards, in struggling with one of the sailors, fell on top of him. The sailor received some internal injury and died the same night. The whole affair was subsequently admitted to be a simple accident and the quarrel quite unpremeditated as far as the quarantine men were concerned, indeed this was evident from the start, but Com mandant Depiere ascribed this event also to the instigation of the ^ Shaikh. In actual' fact the Shaikh was quite unconnected with either affair. He is too clever a man to think of paying off a debt in such a manner as an assault on Belgian officials, attention from Tehran being the last thing which he desires. He had the previous year asked His Majesty's Consul to warn British subjects against walking on the desert unattended, especially during the date season when Arabs of all types are about. These questions have all settled down and the relations between the Shaikh and Customs appear cordial. Abadan.—A-i the end of December 1912 the Belgian Administration placed ^ ^ a Persian Post Office at Abadan, within 08 ce8 ' the limits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession, in the building which the Company had supplied to the Customs Department for the purpose of a Customs surveillanc e post. This step was taken without consulting either His Majesty's Government or the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the object being to obtain the profits arising from the correspondence which issues from Abadan and which at present goes to swell the takings of the British Post Office at Mohammerah. Objection was immediately taken to this action on the part of the Belgian Administration. It would have been impossible for the company to consen to a public Persian Post Office being placed within their concession since it is necessary that their full control over the movements of the public within tneir limits should be maintained owing to the danger which might arise from smo- ing, or the careless striking of lights. It would have been equally impossi to permit the breach of concessionary rights which was committed by the os a Department in their method of instituting this branch office. All the Company's correspondence is sent direct to Mohammerah by launch or carriage. The object of the postal authorities was to divert tins s J® , of correspondence into the channel of their own department, a process w would gradually have been extended to the other out-offices of the omp ' which would thus have been forced to depend upon the unreliab e . , system for the transaction of its business. His Majesty s Consul acco oFOR THE TEAR 1913. 85 protested against the action taken and informed tlie Director of Customs and | os ts that, without orders from the British Legation in Tehran, he could not permit the Persian Post Office to be placed within the limit of a British con- cession. Notwithstanding tliis protest, it transpired, tliat letters were being accepted by the Post Office which, indeed, issued picture post-cards to popularise the n ew venture. His Majesty's Consul was obliged to inform the Director of Customs that&gt; owing to the inconvenience caused by the public using the thoroughfare to the post Office, the company would be obliged to close the road leading to it. The matter had been, in the meantime, referred to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, and the office was finally closed in the month of March. After the close of the year the Director of Customs again approached His Majesty's Consul asking whether His Majesty's Government would object to a Post Office being instituted at Abadan outside of the limits of the Oil Company. At the same time the Anglo-Persian Oil Company asked whether it would be possible to place a British Post Office at Abadan, more especially to deal with the money order business which had attained large dimensions and was becoming a tax on the company. These two questions were taken to Bushire for discussion with Mr Lorimer. His death prevented their being taken up and they have since been kept pend ing the arrival of His Majesty's Minister's despatch, on the general subject of Posh Offices in Persia, reference to which will follow on the subject of the British Post Office which was proposed for Ahwaz. Ahwaz. —In his letter, No. 431, dated 9th February 1913, to the Govern ment of India, on the subject of British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf, Sir Percy Oox raised the point that there was no British Post Office at Ahwaz. He stated the principal firms have learnt by bitter experience that correspondence of urgency or importance cannot safely be entrusted to the Persian Post Office ' 'it would be convenient, both with a view to facilitating our commerce and emphasising the position of Ahwaz as one of the ports of the Persian Gulf to initiate a British Post Office there.' His Majesty's Consul was accordingly called upon for a report and suggested that, in the circumstances, a launch service would be preferable to a land service, since the base of our con tention was that Ahwaz was a Gulf port. Negotiations were accordingly opened with Messrs. Strick, Scott and Com pany, the agents of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who, after the close of the year, agreed to accept a subsidy of £250 per annum and to maintain a weekly launch service for the purpose in connection with the British India mail steamers. The Postmaster-General having objected to this charge being made against the Postal service, it was recommended that any deficit should be met by a Political grant. While the final contracts were being drawn out after the conclusion of the year, a telegram was received by the Resident from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran in which it was stated that the Persian Government had objected to the institution of the proposed Post Office and that a despatch dealing with the general question of British Post Offices in Persia had been sent to Bushire. All Post Office questions have been kept pending its arrival since it would be of little use putting up suggestions until the tenour of this despatch is known. Mohammerah. —The work of the British Post Office has continued to expand and it has been found necessary to obtain better accommodation than the present cramped quarters within the Consulate building. Plans for a new Post Office are being approved and a site of land, along side the Consulate, has been obtained from the Shaikh for the erection of the new building.1 86 11 t, PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT The following figures will show the growth of post office work during the year and, incidentally, the continued expansion of Mohammerah. — 1910. 1911. 1912. 1913,, Registered Letters received • • 2,989 3,513 8,683 4,607 Registered Letters despatched . • ... 830 1,749 Parcels received ..... 1,718 3,034 3,202 4,607 Parcels despatched .... ... ... 195 295 Rs.

At the request of the Mohammerah Chamber of Commerce the temporary repair of the line was undertaken, with wooden poles, during the summer. The poles were so frequently stolen, however, that the line was soon down again. It has now been commenced from the Borasjun end with iron poles and it is hoped that it will be in working order again before long. In November 1913 a Consular Surgeon was appointed for Mohammerah. Me(iical&gt; Captain H. W. Pierpoint, I.M.S., was nominated for the post, but was sub sequently transferred to the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission. His place was not filled and, in consequence, the Consulate has remained without a Medical Officer. In present circumstances this has been very un fortunate since not the least of the methods which we should employ to mark our predominance and to extend our influence is by the erection of a Hospital. It is to be trusted that His Majesty's Government will realise the importance of this point. # At the moment of writing plans for a hospital are being submitted. The Dispensary has steadily increased its w^ork under the capable charge of the Quarantine Medical Officer, Assistant Surgeon Lincoln, who supplies me with the following figures. The allotments for this purpose are insufficient and the Assistant Surgeon has to do the dispensing and entering up himself. A compounder has been sanctioned and will shortly be employed.

The school is now financially on a sound footing and the numbers have gone up to close on 100 boys. The opportunity to hand with this school for increasing our influence is so apparent that His Majesty's Uonsul has submitted to His Majesty's Government suggestions for its improvement. His Majesty's Consul has equally been asked to take over the making of a Roads. r ? ad tllrou S h tlie d ate gardens from the river to the town.

Monsieur Dmitri Belayew, the acting Russian Consul-General at Bushire, Turco -Persian Frontier Commission. visited Mohammerah on the 16th October in connection with the Russian portion of the Boundary Commission of which he had been made the Deputy Commis sioner. He returned to Bushire and, on the 8th November, arrived in company with Captains Zkhaia^ and Alieff, the Russian surveyors, who had come out from Russia, in the 4 4 Tigre.' Captain A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., the British Deputy Commissioner arrived on the 2nd December. Captain H. W. Pierpoint, I.M.S., Medical Officer to the British Commis sion, arrived on the 11th December with Mr. Hubbard, Secretary to the Commission, with the native members of the survey party. Lieutenant-Colonel Ryder, D.S.O.^ R.E., arrived by the same mail but proceeded to Basrah to make observations with Major Cowie, R.E., who had remained at Bushire. Mr. A. C. Wratislaw, C B., C.M.G., Chief Commissioner, arrived at Mohammerah on the 15th December. Monsieur Minorsky, Chief Russian Commissioner, with Mrs. Minorsky arrived on the 13th December. Itela-el-Mulk, one of the Persian Commissioners, arrived with the Russian Commissioners on the 13th but, up to the close of the year, the remaining Persian and Turkish Commissioners had not arrived. Captain Brooke, 18th Lancers, with the Cavalry Escort arrived on the 26th. The British Commission took up their residence in camp while the sians hired a house in the town but, up to the close of the year, little was done except making general arrangements.

During the year work at the Abadan Eefinery has continued steadily and the exports show a substantial increase. The quantity of various grades of refined oils exported reached a total of 163,000 tons. Over and above this heavy consignments of cased oil was despatched for the local market. The Imperial Bank of Persia. —Notwithstanding that it was a bad year for business, the Bank reached their turnover of the previous year. Messrs. Lynch -Bros.—Mr. Martin, the Agent at Mohammerah, died in March and was relieved by Mr. Ashton who was invalided for typhoid later in the year. He was relieved by Captain Rawlins, who has recently died of cancer. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co. were represented by Mr. Spence throughout the year. An Admiralty Commission consisting of Admiral Sir Edmond Slade n . . K.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., Professor Cadman of the Birmingham Univerisity, Mr. Blund- stone, a mining expert, Mr. Pascoe of the Geological Department of the Government of India with Mr. Clarke, of the Board of Trade, as Secretary, arrived on the 26th of October and were joined by Mr. James, the Geologist to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. They proceeded to Ahwaz and the Oil Fields on a tour of inspectioa of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concessions, returning to Mohammerah on the 7th November. They left for Kuwait on the 10th of the same month returning again on the 17th, leaving finally in H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' on the 20th en route to Bahrain. The Commission was much struck with the possibilities and prospects of the Oil Pields. The option for the railway from Mohammerah to Khurramabad having Mohammerah-Khurramabad Railway. been obtained by a British Syndicate, four engineers, Messrs. Whitelaw, Apted, Moore and Douglas, arrived to commence the survey in April. They completed the preliminary survey in the Spring. Captain A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., who had been appointed Political Officer at Dizful, in connection with the railway, had already proceeded to Ahwaz e% route to Dizful on the 28th March. He remained in Luristan and Dizful and finally proceeded home on leave, in May. Having completed their preliminary survey of the portion of the country between Mohammerah and Dizful, the survey party proceeded to India, except Mr. Whitelaw, who proceeded home. They returned to Arabistan in September while one of their number, Mr. Douglas, travelled to Hamadan via Baghdad to meet Captain Wilson who was returning to Tehran and who, accompanied by Mr. Douglas, travelled through Luristan from the North arriving in Dizful in November Captain Wilson made arrangements with the various tribes en route for the safe passage of the party for the survey of Luristan. Captain Crosthwaite had, in the meantime, been appointed to relieve Captain Wilson, who had been nominated Deputy Commissioner with the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission. Captain Crosthwaite and the survey party were joined by Dr. Young at the end of November. Dr. Young represented the Hail way syndicate. Pourparlers were carried on with the chiefs of the Luristan tribes with reference to the payments which they required for the safe conduct of the railway party through Luristan. Captain Crosthwaite and Dr. Young finally decided that they would be too much at the mercy of the tribes through whose country they would pass and who would be able to demand what sums they wished once they had gotPOE THE TEAR 1918. 89 the survey party into their country, accordingly all idea of attempting the task wa s abandoned. A plan had been put forward, strongly supported by the Shaikh of Moliammerah, for the appointing of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh as Governor General of Luristan and Arabistan. The idea was that, by insisting on his beinff given sufficient forces and with the support of the Shaikh, he would have ,,0 difficulty in quieting the country and gmng the party the safe conduct which they required. This plan was knocked on the head by the bad health of the Nizam who was unable to take up the appointment at the time. His Majesty's Consul recently visited Dizful and formed the opinion that it would have been possible to have carried out Captain Wilson's arrangements had the Political Officer been able to enlist a guard of some 60 or 70 men to accompany him and the party. No Luristan tribe would have attempted to browbeat a party so accompanied while the men of a suitable type, who would not run away at a shot, could have been found. His Majesty's Consul had occasion to test the courage of a guard supplied him on a recent tour. It may be added that, in dealing with tribes in Persia, it is necessary to make a certain show and a guard of some nature is necessary simply to mark the importance of the envoy or official. The Political Officer possessed no such guard which was no doubt the cause of some of the impertinence complained of. H. M. S. Sphinx arrived at Mohammerah on the 3rd September in con- Date season and piracy. nection with the date season. She pat- rolled the river and bar and also visited Basrah. She left with Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, K.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., on the 20tli November, as noted under Oil Commission. There were two piracies on the river between Mohammerah and Basrah immediately after her departure. In the first case an Indian dhow was looted and tlie Captain killed. The assailants came alongside in bellams at night and attacked the boat. In the second case a lighter belonging to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was attacked by a band of pirates. About 100 cases of oil and some £50 in cash were taken. Both cases occurred near Ab-ul-Kliasib a within Basrah territory and out side the limits of this Consulate. It was anticipated that the obtaining of the option for a railway from German competition. Mohammerah to Khurramabad would focus the attention of foreign powers upon Arabistan, a remark which would apply with greater strength to Germany than to any other nation. The measures necessary to consolidate our position in Arabistan has already been the subject of discussion with the Resident and, on August 2nd, a report on this subject was submitted. In that report the danger of Poreign competition was shown and the necessity for steps to determine our position was demonstrated. It was pointed out that, once our political position was determined, the rest was of smaller importance. At the very time the report was being completed, at the end of July, the Germans placed their first steamer the ' Pioneer' on the Karun. The ship had actually been imported for work on the Shatt-el-Arab in connec tion with the cargo arriving for the Baghdad Railway, but has continued to work on the Karun up to the close of the year. The 14 Pioneer ' was immediately followed by the tug ' Samara ' which, though under the control of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., flies the Turkish flag and was imported for work on the Tigris. Up to the close of the year these two ships towing two barges each had made twelve trips on the Karun aiid had disposed of l,4i23 tons of cargo.90 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT The question of this German competition has overshadowed ail other subjects in political importaDce in Arabistan. It is hardly necessary in this report to repeat the terms of the various despatches which have been submitted on this subject, since to do so would extend its limits to undue proportions. It will suffice to note that measures have been submitted for approval which, if sanctioned, will, it is trusted meet the situation. The movement is one which was to be expected as the natural outcome of the policy of the German Government on the Baghdad Railway and in the Shatt-el-Arab. Messrs. Wonckhaus have for some time had a grain purchasing branch in Mohammerah. Since the middle uf the year they have shown much greater activity. As noted they have placed two steamers on the river, they have been in negotiation for a wharf at Ahwaz, and have placed a German to control their business at that place. They have placed with a German firm orders for motor barges which will shortly be ready for traffic Their agent approached the Imperial Bank of Persia in Mohammerah with an offer to carry specie at half the rates charged by the British India or by Messrs. Lynch Bros Herr Zinnow, one of their Directors, has visited Ahwaz and wished ;to visit Shushtar. There is little doubt that the firm intend to open at Dizful and Shushtar while everything points to their taking up a Porwarding agency to Ispahan. They are making big preparations for the grain season, and the agent here has asked the Imperial Bank of Persia to quote rates for £30,000 worth of krans. This activity is hardly commercial only, and suggestions have been for warded to higher authority as to the best way to meet it. It is undeniable that the German firm is carrying out its attack very well. Both here and in Basrah the firm understands the value of a good show for impressing the Eastern, and they never have any hesitation in spending money where a good advertisement is to be obtained. Their name consequently stands well and brings them in much trade. In the previous year we had assisted the Nizam-es-Sultan eh to obtain Nizam-es-Suitaneh. I 110116 / f f om Imperial Bank of Persia m order to release him from debts to the Banque d'Escomptes in Tehran. The Shaikh of Mohammerah provided the money to enable the Mzam to get away to Europe as there appeared to be danger of his being stopped He subsequently took the loan from the Bank to meet the amount having received the Nizam's properties in Arabistan and the South of Persia as security. The Mzam had not been very successful in gaining our good will in Shiraz in 1911 owing to the mistaken line of policy he had followed while Governor there. His old friendship with the Shaikh was however unbroken and it was soon realised that, if he could be brought completely under our influence, his value to us could be very great. All the lands covered by the Mohammerah- Khurramabad Railway, as far as Dizful, which do not actually belong to the Shaikh are the property of tiie Nizam-es-Sultaneh and his co-heirs though managed by the Shaikh. The latter was prepared to go security for the future good behaviour of the Nizam. The Minister was accordingly approached with a view to obtain ing safeguards for the Nizam's safe return to Persia. Pinally, in June, it was determined to give the Nizam an opportunity of whitew ashing himself provided that he save us a guarantee in return for our support to the effect that he would take no step opposed to officials of the British Government and that, if he ever w ished to lease or sell his lands in Arabistan or Luristan, he would only do so after consulting the British representatives while equally should he desire to change the agents o^ factois of his properties or to put foreigners in their position he would only do soFOE THE TEAE 1913. gi w ith the approval of the said British representatives. His MaW,,'* i had been in indirect communication with the Nizam through the ShaS of Mohammerah and the necessary guarantee was immediately |iven On the 24th October the Minister telegraphed that the Minister of the Interior had stated that the Nizam-es-Sultaneh could return to Persia in perfect safety and need have no fear of the Persian Government or of anv hostile influence. He also offered the Governorship of Luristan to Vhp Nizam and laid special stress on our interest in the Nizam's welfare The ahove mentioned guarantee given by the Nizam, combined with the Shaikh's good will, give us indirect control over the greater part of Arabistan and part ot i* ars. The Nizam-es-Sultaneh has now returned to Persia and, his health having considerably improved, there is hope of his being appointed Governor General of Luristan, a position which, notwithstanding our desire to see him accept it, he was unable to take up when first offered him owin&lt;* to the severe illness which he had had in Europe which had necessitated a serious operation. During the early months of the year the relations between the Shaikh and the Bakhtians continued to be the question engrossing all attention Shaikh of Mohammei-ah and Bakhtiari. 111 -^histan. Two important points had , • „ remained unsettled from the previous T £ e Sllaikl1 ofthat Part of the JarraM lands which had been purchased by the Eakhtiari from the Muahir-ed-Dowleh the other being the unfortunate raid on the Aqili lands which was made by r e ^ i ra KS . n' heen collected to repel the Bakhtiari attack on the Shaikhs Deputy Governor at Shushtar in the previous May. settlement of the latter case was largely a personal matter since it mainly concerned the Sirdar Muhtasham, the then Minister of War, and his family, the owners of the lands. Owing however to the weight of the Sirdar Muhtasham m Bakhtiari councils it added to the gravitv of the general situaition. ^ The question of the Jarrahi lands was more serious. The lands had j'y the Bakhtians in Tehran, perhaps with a view to irritating the Shaikh and as an asset m the political situation where he was concerned, but also with a knowledge that if they had to sell it would be possible to obtain an enhanced price. of the sale to the Bakhtiaris the Shaikh immediately stated untenable t0 be Corn P leted since ^ woul(i make position That he was foolish to allow the purchase to be made is undoubted, but m ^7 con sider a sale possible without his being first informed of the proposed transaction. In actual fact it was completed before he had heard The iands in question are populated by the Shaikh's Arab tribes and eir control by Bakhtiaris would constitute a menace which he could not ace apart from the blow to his prestige. The Jarrahi lands had always T* • j 8 - P ossess i on ftE-d under his control and Government and if the samrnns did, as they threatened to do, take over the country his position n a ave received a shock which it could not have sustained. ^ las getting more and more unsettled the conditions in I s . , ai } fy e been steadily improving. The policy of the Shaikh has been to •xf. i-V 118 ., Powers gradually over the detached 'and scattered Arab tribes n ms borders or who own him as their lord and chief. Ihis policy is one which it is for us to encourage as it is greatly to our M' 1 o^he Shaikhdom, which grew during the chief ship of Shaikh iza , the brother and predecessor of the present Shaikh, has greatly increased wh/1* incumbency of Shaikh Khazal while British support and the honours c he has received from the British Government have greatly assisted him. IriK ^ Bakhtiaris into a portion of the land, the property of es 0Wnin g allegiance to him, would not only have damaged the Shaikh's92 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT prestige but, with the knowledge of the assurances which we had given him would also have affected our position both with the Arabs and the Bakhtiaris whether the point came actually within our assurances or not ; indeed this last would have been a position on which they would have had no correct inform ation. To meet the situation the Shaikh collected forces so as to have them at his disposal should the Bakhtiaris take any forward measures. By the time the Bakhtiaris arrived in the Spring he had some 10,000 to 15,000 men massed in various parts of the country, in Jarrahi to menace Eam Hormuz and near Dizful to threaten other Bakhtiari property. Sirdar-i-Jang, the Ilkhani of the Bakhtiari, had, in Tehran, made a definite promise to the Minister that he would hand over the Jarrahi lands, i .e., their purchase deeds to the Shaikh. On reaching Bakhtiari country, however, he announced that he had no intention of doing so. As matters were approaching a crisis and, after representa tions to the Minister, the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz was sent to the Sirdar Jang to inform him that any disturbance in Arabistan would be a matter of grave concern to His Majesty's Government. His Majesty's Vice-Consul was also told to impress on Sirdar Jang the importance of his carrying out his promise to the Minister to dispose of the Jarrahi lands to the Shaikh. Captain Grey reports that at first Sirdar Jang was obstinate, but that he finally became more reasonable and told His Majesty's Vice-Oonsul that, in actual fact, he had not the power to sell without the consent of the Khans in Tehran. After a period of crisis the Shaikh's eldest son and iHaji Eais visited the Sirdar Jang near Eam Hormuz and terms mere arranged which terminated the danger and the Shaikh dismissed his troops. The bargain cost the Shaikh a fair amount of money but was little com pared with the expenses for the upkeep of an army. Sirdar Jang informed Captain Grey that he had intended to send agents to take over the lands until he realised how grave a matter of concern it was to His Majesty's Government. It was thus touch and go as to whether Arabistan should be in a blaze. The terms arranged required the sanction of the Khans in Tehran which was not obtained until the Minister had brought his influence to bear. Sirdar Jang finally met the Shaikh at Bend-i-Kir near Ahwaz on his home ward journey to Bakhtiaristan and the final terms of the agreement were signed, in May, by which the Shaikh paid tomans 30,000 for the Jarrahi lands and gave a present of tomans 5,000 for the damage done in the Aqili raid. Neither His Majesty's Consul for Arabistan nor His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Ahwaz were present at these proceedings, but a copy of the agreement was sent to the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz to mark the fact that it had been arrived at. The meetings at Eamuz and Bend-i-Kir are a tribute to the political genius of Haji Eais and it seems difficult to realise that, at the finish, the Shaikh became the agent for the Bakhtiaris in all matters in Arabistan. His Majesty's Consul has in season and out of season impressed upon the Shaikh that his interests lie in attempting to keep up his friendship with the Bakhtiari, a point which he fully admits. The difficulty is to carry it out owing to the fact that the Bakhtiari are so divided among themselves. At the moment of writing a meeting is taking place near Ahwaz between the Shaikh and the Sirdar Jang. It is hoped that the friendship which has been maintained throughout the year will be strenghthened. There are two points of difficulty which should be removed. The first is the Amir Mujahid, w^o helped the Shaikh in the time of his need but who is at the present moment an embarrassing friend owing to the fact that he is on very bad terms with the rest of the Khans and his friendship with the Shaikh is not well viewed. It is to the Shaikh's credit that he refuses to throw him over The Amir Mujahid is proceeding to Europe which may get rid of the difficulty.JOE THE TEAR 1913. gg The other question is that of the Zaitun lands which are nartlv tl,o , 0 f the Sirdar Assad and other Bakhtiaris. These lands are a source of constat irritation and the Shaikh must either purchase them outright at the price the Bakhtiaris ask or must give up his mortgage on them at a reasonable Eelations with the Shaikh. 1 with the Shaikh haVG COIL- tinued to be as satisfactory as ever With the development of Arabistan however and the STflTiH™ nf ^ for the Mohammerah-Khurramabad RaUway a new phase has arrived The Shaikh feels that his position is not assured in suite of in^n^ ,, on account of, the terms on which he is with us. P ' Udeed ^ From our own point of view also the situation is one which needs revision. For the Shaikh the position is not assured since the development of Arabistan is of necessity bound to increase the avidity of the Persian ft™™ ment with regard o his territories. The fact that on good terns wXu^ and is giving us all that lies in his power does not endear him to the Persian Government and makes him a certain number of enemies. He feels tli P r. tw while willing to give to u. all that we | may desire or he can supply L Vo ^d like, in return, to acquire a greater sense of security than he enjoys at present Our position also was one requiring thought. We had assured the Shaikh that we would see that his rights and privileges were respected bv the Persia n Government. This assurance was a private one. J If the Belgians increase their control oyer the revenues and the general Government and the Swedes also increased their control over the countrv a might easily anse when we should find ourselves in a difficult position To refuse to assist the Persian Government in a reform might be to assume aposi- tion which might seem to be standing in the way of progress and which we could not adopt; on the other hand to agree to their demands might verv easilv be agreeing to an encroachment on the rights and privileges of tie Shaikh. To meet the Shaikh's difficulty and our own the only alternative appeared to be to inform the Persian Government of the fact that, owinf? to the Vreat interests we had m Arabistan, we had been obliged to take up a very special Ed 1 Shaikh and to see that his privileges were Laiii- This procedure has accordingly been recommended for the consideration of His Majesty s Government. Another point which required deliberation was the question of the Shaikh's Heir ihe Shaikh was anxious that we should delete from the assurances the words referring to the approval of his tribes on this subject. aSSurailces It was obvious that, before we could do this, it would be necessary to have tne right to approve of the heir ourselves. This question is also under consideration. The Shaikh has shown himself, as ever, willing to meet all our wishes. He consented to the terms of the Anglo-Turkish Convention in all matters in which ne was concerned, agreed to make the British Commissioner on the Eiverain i^oard his agent in matters affecting the Shatt-el-Arab and showed everv trust m our arrangements. ^ Mnii? 6 iiaS . a ^ s0 g ran ^ e( i us an option for irrigation on the Karun near i . T ki s 0 ption is but temporary and with a view to something more definite being determined. 5 Intimately connected with our relations with the Shaikh is the question Internal administration. of his administration. y0ars a ^ 0 Mohammerah was an Arab village, to-day it possesses the sn™! qa -n Ur0 P earL population in the Gulf. At Mohammerah itself there are v uropeans, while 8^ miles away, at Abadan, is a colony of a further 30 Europeans and 1,000 British Indians. thp ^ ie C0n ^ nue( i development of the place will need more than staff at the disposal of the Shaikh.94 PERSIAN GTJI/P ADMINISTRATION REPORT Agha Abdi, the Deputy Governor, has done astonishingly well, but he governs by rule of thumb and can neither read nor write. These methods have succeeded fairly well up to date and this Consulate has nothing to complain of since its desires are always acceded to, but the future will demand some thing more. The Shaikh is willing to do what he can for the better regulation of his towns, but all matters await a reply to the various representations which have been made and which are referred to under 'Relations with the Shaikh. 5 ' Shaikh Chasib, the Shaikh's eldest son who, as has been stated, has been Governor at Ahwaz, has been far from an unqualified success. His Majesty's Consul is about to suggest to the Shaikh that either he be brought to Mohammerah to be under his father's eye or that he be sent on an extended tour to Europe. The latter plan would keep him out of the way for some time and would be the easiest way of putting his next brother in his place, should it be necessary. Haji Eais, the Shaikh's right hand man, was absent in India, Egypt and Europe for the last six months of the year. His absence showed how much of the routine work of the Shaikh's terri tories hangs on his shoulders. It was frequently difficult to get letters answered. While home the Germans made a special point of seeing that he was well entertained and that everything was shown to him. On the 11th June His Majesty's Consul, in the presence of the European Presentation of the Potrait of His Majesty community and a large gathering of King George V to the Shaikh, Persians and Arabs, handed over to the Shaikh a picture of His Majesty, King George V., which had been sent by His Majesty's Government for presentation. His Majesty's Consul took advantage of the opportunity to refer to the good relations existing between the British Government and the Shaikh and to ex press the hope that those relations would always tend towards the progress and prosperity of Arabistan. mfor THE YEAR 1913. 95 CHAPTER VH. administration report por the ahwaz vice-consulate for the year 1913.

The commonest diseases were eye-diseases (2,006 patients), skin affections (1,662 patients) and intestinal worms (1,292 patients). Epidemic diseases were small-pox, influenza and whooping cough.

A sum of £80 was raised by private subscription from the European residents and the ground was enclosed with a well built stone wall. Bakhtiari. —Najaf Kuli Khan, Samsam-us-Sultaneh, and Ghulam Husain Khan, Sirdar Muhtasham, have continued Condition o£ country. their official appointments of Ilkhani and Ilbegi of the Bakhtiari tribe throughout the year under report. These two Chiefs have, however, been absent from tribal territory during the whole year, and the tribal administration was being carried on by Sirdar-i-Jang as Ilkhani and Muitaza Kuli Khan as Ilbegi at the commencement of the year. Bakhtiari expedition against the Kuhgelu. —At that time Sirdar-i-Jarg was busily engaged in organising the force with which he announced his intention of completely annihilating the Kuhgelu tribes and thus carrying out the promises which he had made in Tehran, at the time of his appointment in 1912. To follow the fortunes of this expeditionary force it is necessary to give some account of the state of affairs in the Kuhgelu country at the time when it was launched into the territory of that tribe. Amir-i-Mujahid, who had been appointed to the Governorship of Behhehan and Kuhgelu by Sirdar-i-Jang, in October of 1912, reached his capital in Nov ember of the same year. The Kuhgelu chiefs treated the Amir with scant courtesy. They refused to come in and make their submission to him, or, in any way recognise his position or authority. The Amir spent his time profit ably in collecting taxes from the town and immediate environs of Belibehan. He made minor changes in the internal administration of the Bahmai tribe, which pays its revenue and is subject to the Bakhtiari chiefs, and treacherously captured Ali Muhammad Khan, the Chief of the Garmisiri section of the Taibi. This state of affairs continued until January, when it became evident that by force of arms alone was there any hope of getting the Kuhgelu ki hand and establishing some sort of authority over them. A military expedition was therefore decided upon and fovo columns were formed. One numbering some 3,000 Bakhtiari tofangchis, under Sarum-ul-Mulk, supported by 1,000 Bahmai of the Ahmadi section under Husain Khan, was collected on the Bakhtiari frontier, near Kaleh Ala. The other column was composed of 1,000 Bakhtiaris supported by a force of about 1,000 friendly Kuhgelu. The Kuhgelu consisted of a small section of the Buwair Ahmadi under Shukrullan Khan, the Churam and Bavi tribes. This column was sent to Amir Mujahid to operate from the direction of Behbehan. The Bakhtiari contingents in both these columns were a ragged lot of peasants badly armed with a miscellaneous assortment of anti quated weapons and provided with a minimum of ammunition. The two columns started into Kuhgelu tribal territory on the 20th Pehru- ary, the objective of both being Deh Dasht, the approaches to which had been occupied by the hostile Kuhgelu tribes. The northern (Kuleh Ala) column had got no further than four or five marches into the enemies* country when it was cut off from its base by the Kuhgelu. The country in which the force was operating is devoid of supplies and the column was soon reduced to the direst straits. The few baggage ^ and donkeys, which had accompanied the column were killed for food, and 0 Bakhtiaris, faced with starvation, began deserting in great numbers, fleeing o their homes and being robbed and stripped en route by the Kuhgelus. column struggled on as best it could to Kaleh Eaisi, where, on the night o 15th March, it was attacked by a force of Taibi and completely routed, exact Bakhtiari losses in killed and wounded in this engagement are not Knew »FOE THE TEAR 1919. g7 but, tliey were considerable, and it is known that the Taibi captured 120 Bakh- tiari riflss. Sarum -ul-Mulk attempted to rally his force, but the tribesmen were so disheartened by the reverse and desertions increased to such an alarming extent that he eveatually decided to withdraw from the enemies' country He re- crossed the Bakhtian frontier a few days later. The Southern or Behbehan column meanwhile had met with better success. It advanced as far as Deh Dasht, fighting some minor engase- ineats and capturing some towers and tribal forts, It appeared how ever, that these successes were in no way due to the Bakhtian tofangchis' who took little or no part in the fighting and the majority of whom deserted within a Tor y short time, but were due solely to the efforts of the friendly Kuheelus who soon formed the greater part of the force The fighting soon degenerated into promiscuous intei-tiibal quarrels and the so-called column ffraduallv disbanded, all hostilities ceasing when Amir Mujahid abandoned the Behhehan Governorship in May. The result of this complete failure of the Bakhtiari Military expedition was to confirm the Kuhgelu tribes in the belief that they have now nothing to fear from their Baklitian neighbours, and that they are more than a match for them when it conies to fighting. Bakhtiari relations with the Shaikh of Mohammerah. —While these events wore taking place in K.uhgelu country, a critical situation had arisen between the Bakhtiaris and the Shaikh of Mohammerah in connection with the Jarrahi lands, and the damage caused to Bakhtiari property by the Arab raids on Aqili in 1912. Sirdar-i-.I ang, at the time of his appointment to the Bakhtiari Ilkhaniship, had assured His Majesty's Minister that he enter tained the most friendly feelings towards the Shaikh, and would, during the winter, re-sell to him the Jarrahi lands and settle the question of the Aqili compensation in a friendly spirit. In January, however, the Sirdar announced that he had no intention of selling Jarrahi but would shortly send his mamurs to take possession of the property, and he declared that the only point for discussion with the Shaikh was the question of the amount of compensation, which the latter must pay for the damage caused at Aqili. The Shaikh, on this, decided, if necessary, to resist forcibly any attempt on the part of the Sirdar to send representatives to Jarrahi, and, with this end in view, came to Nasiri and summoned his Arab forces to the number of some 3,000 will-armed men. He stationed another force of 1,000 men on the Earn Hormuz-Jarrahi road. Having taken these precutions, he let it be known that although he would resist any attempt on the part of Sirdar-i-Jang to send reprensentatives to Jarrahi, he was willing to buy those lands from the Khans for the same price which they had originally paid for them, viz , Tomans 15,000. Sirdar-i-Jang declined even to disciiss the question of sale and re-iterated his intention to take over the lands immediately the Kuhgelu expedition was finished. Hostilities appeared imminent and it was decided that we should intervene directly with the Sirdar-i-Jang and Shaikh Khazal and attempt to induce the latter to offer and the former to accept Tomans 30,000 for the Jarrahi lands, this sum to include also the Aqili compensation. Shaikh Khazal agreed to this figure without difficulty and Captain Grey was deputed to proceed to Sirdar-i- Jang's camp and endeavour to influence him in the direction desired. As a result of the subsequent interviews which took place it came to light that the Bakhtiari Khans had specifically forbidden Sirdar-i-Jang to negotiate the sale of Jarrahi with the Shaikh and had directed the latter to take over the property. Captain Grey was however successful in making the Sirdar see that an attempt to take over the property would most certainly lead to hostilities with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, and that we should consider flim and the other Khans responsible for such breach of the peace. He obtained the Sirdar's promise that he would not send mamurs to Jarrahi and would himself urge upon the other Khans the advisability of disposing of the lands in dispute to the Shaikh and establishing friendly relations with him. ,, The Shaikh's sons and his Vizier, Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, were invited to tlle Sirdar's camp, and, during their visit, the Sirdar, as an act of grace, agreedm PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT to forego all claims on account of the Aqili raid. He received in return a &lt;c present ' of Tomans 5,000. As a result of tlio Sirdar-i-Jang's representations to the Khans the latter eventually authorized him to sell Jarrahi and the transfer was subsequently completed for a sum of Tomans 30,000. In March a meeting took place between Sirdar-i-Jang and Shaikh Khazal at which a general compact of peace was concluded between the two tribes, the former acting on behalf of all the Khans. The Khans at first objected to the figure at which Sirdar-i-Jang had sold the Jarrahi lands, but later, finding that they could squeeze no more money from the Shaikh, accepted the former's arrangements and executed the deeds of transfer. These deeds were delivered to the Shaikh in November. In June Sirdar-i-Jang announced his intention of resigning the Bakhtiari T . , A „. Ilkhaniship and requested the senior inteTnal Aiiciirs. ^ , • i. i • mi • Khans to nominate his successor. Thia decision was caused by the attempt of Amir-i-Mujahid to upset the arrange ments made by the Sirdar with the object of ensuring the safety of the Bakh^ tiari road, and also by the attitude adopted towards him by Murtaza Kuli Khan, his Ilbegi. The latter gradually came under the influence of Amir-i-Mujahid and adopted a policy of petty hostility to Sirdar-i-Jang, which greatly embarras sed him. The Sirdar's resignation was refused by the senior Khans and lie carried on the Government as best he could until October, when he finally announced his intention of giving up the Governorship and withdrew to his home at Surk. The senior Khans at last bestirred themselves and summoned him to proceed to Ispahan and there discuss his grievances with them by tele gram. As a result of the discussion the Sirdar agreed to continue in the Bakhtiari Governorship on the condition that Murtaza Kuli Khan should be relieved by another Khan of the Ilkhani branch as Ilbegi. The Sirdar had not left for the llaq up to the close of the year. Mention has already been made of affairs in Behbehan and the Kuhgelu elu country up to the time of the withdrawal of the Bakhtiari expedition and the aban donment of the Governorship of the district by Amir-i-Mujahid. On the departure of this Chief, the district relapsed into its normal state of uncontrol until October, when Sirdar-i-Jang nominated two young Bakhtiari Chiefs, Bahadur-us-Sultaneh and Iskandar Khan, to the joint Governorship of Behbe- han and the Kuhgelu country. These two Chiefs established themselves in Behbehan and busied themslves with collecting the revenue of the town and environs, but failed to establish any control or authority over the Kuhgelu tribes by whom they were com pletely ignored. The Sakhtiari road was open at the commencement of the year under Condition of roade. report. ^ The Bakhtiari expedition against the Kuhgelu tribes, its withdrawal ana abandonment of the Kuhgelu Governorship by Amir-i-Mujahid have already been mentioned. In May Sirdar-i-Jang found himself with one month before him in which to take steps to prevent a repetition of the orgie of disorders of 1912. The failure of the military expedition had lost him what prestige he possessed with the Kuhgelu tribes; but, before taking meaures which would inevitably involve considerable expense, he decided to test once more the efficacy of 4 bluff *. He sent messengers to the Godar bridge to prevent the northward migration of the II who consequently collected in immense numbers in the Malamir plain, and then sent bombastic messages to the Kuhgelu Chiefs ordering them to come and make their submission to him and leave hostages for their good behaviour during the summer months. In the event of their non-compliance with his demands he threatened that he would himself lead an overwhelming force against them and utterly annihilate them. The Kuhgelu Chiefs duly appeared before the Sirdar, not, as the latter had hoped, in the r6 1 e of supplicants but on equal terms, to discuss with him the amount or blackmail which they were willing to accept in return for their refraining irom raiding the road and Bakhtiari villages situated near the Kuhgelu frontier.FOR THE yiJAR 19J3, 99 The Sirdar, seeing that his bluff had failed of effect, lent a willing ear to these proposals, and, after some discussion, agreed to hire 250 guards from tha Kuhgelu at the rate of Tomans 8 per mensem for each man. In addition he provided these guards with ammunition, and, in some cases, with rifles. The ftuhgelu, as a guarantee of their good faith, gave hostages to the Sirdar, who remained with him throughout the summer. These guards were posted on the Sarrak -Sbalil section ot the road, the only section exposed to Kuhgelu raids. The rest of the road was guarded in the usual way by Bakhtiari guards paid by remission of revenue. The cost of the Kuhgelu guards amounted to Tomans 8,000 for pay alone, and the total expense to which the Sirdar W as put was estimated by himself at Tomans 15,000, of which sum the Kuhgelu received at least Tomans 10,000. The Kuhgeus congratulated themselves on their bargain, calculating that they had profited more by taking service than they would have by raiding the road. In years of disorder the most that the raiders can hope for is to rob one or two large caravans before the news of their activity reaches Ispahan and Ahwaz and traffic is suspended. The measures taken by the Sirdar worked perfectly, and not a single robbery was reported on the section of the road entrusted to the Kuhgelu guards. The guards loyally^ observed their part of the bargain and refrained from demanding rahdari or interfering in any way with passing caravans. The policj of the Sirdar in thus s setting a thief to catch a thief ' has been seTerely criticised by the other Bakhtiari Khans and others whose opinio a is of value. They argue that Sirdar-i-Jang, by virtually paying blackmail to the Kuhgelu, has exposed the weakness of the Bakhtiaris and confirmed the Kuhgelu in their opinion that they are more than a match for them. They ajssert that similar measures might possibly prove suocessful for Another year, but, sooner or later, the Kuhgelu Chiefs will realise that they have the whip hand and will demand remuneration quite beyond tha means of the Ilkhani. Sirdar-iJang himself, in a moment of expansion, admitted that tha steps taken were only temporary measures and that a successful punitive expeditiqa against the Kuhgelu remained the only permanent solution of the problem. The road guards were withdrawn in October when the downward migra tion of the tribesmen assured the safety of the road. No losses of British owned 'goods on the road, though robberies were reported to the Vice-Consulate daring the year. The following table shows the goods forwarded over the road and the number of animals employed during the year under report, as compared with the three preceding years.

Lynch Brothers undertook the Agency of the Sooiete de Tombac, and tobacco exported by that firm was included in hynch's transport statistics. It amounted to 6,997 owts, in 1912 and 11,934 cwts. in 1913. To obtain a just comparison for tha four year® these figures should be deducted from the totals for their raspectiva years.

This rise in rates is due in a great measure to the partial failure of the winter rain and consequent scarcity and dearness of grain and fodder, and partly to the general rise in prices, throughout Southern Persia. Sirdar-i-Jang undertook various repairs and improvements on the road during the year. The road in some of the worst parts was cleared of boulders, a good stone bridge was constructed over the Sabz Kuh stream at Dopulun, to replace the dangerous wicker structure, the Karun bridge at Dopulun was repaired and the building of a new caravanserai was commenced at Pul-i- Godar. The structural alterations to the Godar bridge were also undertaken by Messrs. Lynch Brothers during the year, Mr. Sotham, Mr. Reed and a staff of Baghdad! mechanics and workmen proceeded to the site in December. Anglo-Persian Oil Company. —The pipe line and pumping stations , at Tambi have been working satisfactori- Britisn Interest. i y ' The drilling operations at the Oil Fields, in Bakhtiari country, have progressed satisfactorily. At the close of the year five wells were being allowed to flow, ten others were capped and in a position to produce whenever required, fifteen more were drilled through to the cap rock and could be brought into production in the course of a few days, and two others were in process of drilling. The total is thus 29 wells drilled or drilling against 26 at the close of 1912. Owing to a series of breakdowns in the plant at Abadan and other accidents the pipe line has at no time been running to its full capacity, the number of wells allowed to flow has therefore been small. Permission was obtained from the Khans in May to sink trial wells at Maidan-i-Bibiyun and Naft-i-Safid. The necessary plant and drilling machp nery was transported to the latter field at the close of the year. Excellent discipline)was maintained at the field during the year, and there were no disorders to record among the European or native staffs. The attitude of the Bakhtiari Chiefs and tribesmen towards the Company has been most satisfactory and no friction has been experienced. The Bakhtiari tribesmen, who formerly cultivated the land acquired by the Company, were, in March, settled on other vacant land by Sirdar-i-Jangi and this long standing difficulty was thus satisfactorily settled. Mr. Ritchie continued as General Fields Manager, throughout the y ear » Mr Capito acting as Assistant Fields Manager.for the year 1913. On the recommendation of His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul arrange ments were made, as a precautionary measure, for the storage of a number of rifles at the Fields, sufficient to arm the European, Indian and Armenian staffs and the Bakhtian guards, inese nfiei with ammunition were delivered at the Fields during the year. His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Cor sul visited the Bakhtiari Khans at Tours of His Britannic Majesty's Representa- Sar-i-Leh in connection with the Shaikh- tive i j. • ,, Bakhtiari relations, leaving Ahwaz on 17th February and returning on the 10th March. He left for the Oil Fields on the 16th April and after a halt of a week, proceeded to Ispahan, which was reached on the 10th May. On the 18th July he again left on tour, visitino- the executive Chiefs at Chighakbur, and travelled via the Khans' homes at Shalam- zar, Junaghun and Farsun to Karkunan to report upon the Karun diversion scheme at that point. He returned by another route reaching Ispahan on the 10th August He left Ispahan on the 4th October and, travelling via Surk and Masjid Suleiman, reached headquarters on the 23rd of the same month. His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul was absent from Headquarters alto gether about 7 months, during the year, and a distance of 1,050 miles was travelled by road during the tours. A French traveller, Monsieur Bourqin, with his wife, traversed Bakhtiari Miscellaneous. ^ 0f Major Cox and Lieutenant Fowle, Indian Army, travelled from Ispahan, to Ahwaz in March. Major Crauford, accom panied Captain Grey to Ispahan in April. Monsieur Viollet, a French architect, and his wife, traversed the country in July, and Lieutenant Steward, Indian Army, also in July. The road was also traversed by Mr. Baird, M.P., and Mr. Hope, British and Foreign Bible Society, and Mrs. Jlope, in October and November. All these journeys were performed without incident. In November two Russian Engineers visited Karknnan to survey and report upon the irrigation scheme at that site. The rainfall for the year at Ahwaz amounted to 12-62 inches.

Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad ar Ruwaihi, French Consulate dragoman, visited Sur during the first week of May for the purpose of renewing dhows' papers. Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf „ c ■ visited Maskat only once during the year, \ iai s o esi en . October, when he spent a fortnight there. Oji the 1st January, Proclamation day, the Agency flagstaff was dressed. The Foreign Consuls and also His High ness the Sultan dressed flagstaffs, forts and yacht. The usual ceremonial visits were paid by the Sultan and the ^Foreign Consuls. During the Sultan's visit Khan Sahib Saiyid Muhammad bin Saeed was presented with the ribbon and the badge of ' Khan Sahib.' On the 6th May, the accession day of His Imperial Majesty, King George V, was celebrated. The Agency flagstaff, Foreign Consulates and the Sultan's forts were dressed for the occasion.

' Swiftsure.FOR THE YEAR 1913. 103 On the evening of the 4th October in the present year, His Highness the Hi» HigtaesUhe Snit«u and his familj. ^ultan Sir ^ Saiyid Faisal bin Turkf, . rr^ v, 4? vr O.I.E., Sultan of Maskat and 'Oman died Of a dropsy. Though, for some years, his health had occasionally shown disquieting symptoms, His Highness was actively attending to State affairs during the months of August and the first half of September. Even as late «! 28th September, the Agency Surgeon, who was, with Major Corrie Hudson I. M.S., in constant attendance on His Highness until the very end antici pated no immediate danger, though the Sultan's condition glye cause for grave anxiety, Relations between His Highness and the Agency were exceedingly cordial until the sad event recorded above took place As the Imam's rebellion presently to be mentioned, gathered strensth, His Highness came to rely more and more on the advice and assistance of the British authorities and it was remarked, in more directions than one, that the rebellion had shown His Highness where his true interests lay and on whose friendship he could confidently rely. Saiyid Eazal bm Turki became Sultan of Maskat in 1888, succeeding his father, Saiyid. Turki bin Saeed, whose second son he was. He was not, however, recognised as Sultaa of Maskat and 'Oman by the British Government until 1890. In 1895, a formidable rising of the Hinawi tribesmen took place against him, when the rebels actually penetrated into Maskat, and Saiyid Pazal was turned temporarily out of his palace and became a refugee in the Eastern fort of Maskat. At the time of his death, he was faced with another serious rebellion, which is described later in this report. We may almost say that his reign too marked the rise of the arms traffic, which so frequently imperil led the friendly relations between his State and the British Government. It may be possible to hope that the warehouse which he established last year may practically close this troublesome question so far as concerns Maskat. The other main controversy which troubled Maskat tranquillity during Saiyid Fazal's reign was the t£ Prench flag' question, settted in favour of the views of the Sultan and the British Government by the Hague tribunal in 1905. A much abused man, while he lived, Saiyid Eazal bin Turki has, in many quarters, been deeply regretted since his death. He was undoubtedly a weak mlerjsbut his pleasant genial manners and accessibility won him some popularity. He never wanted personal courage and was undoubtedly kindly and humane. He could never, at least so far as the writer could observe, find it in his heart to punish anybody and the natural result, in a place like Maskat, was chaos in the administration. The loud lamentations, that accompanied his corpse to its last resting place, were not altogether due to the hysteria of the crowd. That Maskat declined greatly in prosperity during bis reign was not due so much to any action or neglect on the part of the ruler but to external circumstances over which he had no control.X Much of the transport trade in which Maskat catered for to the smaller Persian and Arab ports, has now disappeared owing to the direct visits of steamers from India and Europe to those ports. The tribes of 'Oman had never any justification for their rebellious attitude towards a ruler who never troubled them with taxation nor oppressed them in any way. So far as his means admitted, he was generous to theJtribesmen and it was probably only his weakness, coupled with rumours as to the possible effect of the new arms traffic regulations, that tempted them to darken the closing days of his existence. He was succeeded by Saiyid Taimur, his eldest son, who was recognised by the British and French Governments on the 15th November 1913. A member of the Sultan's family who may come into greater prominence later on is Saiyid Dhiyab bin Fahad bin Turki, who arrived at Maskat about June of the present year. He has been educated in England and talks English fluently. He is a young man of pleasent manners and appearance ; on State occasions he, with Saiyids Nadir and Muhammad, remains in attendance on oaiyid Taimur but does not so far interfere to any great extent in the aamin- istration.PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT 'Rver since the death of His late Highness, Saiyid Muhammad bin Turki, his sons have been living in the closest retirement and are never seen abroad' Saiyid Muhammad evidently felt aggrieved at the recognition of Saiyid Taimur as Sultan and, although the present Sultan and his brother Muhammad invari ably visit their uncle and his family once a week, he shows no signs of being pacified and continues to ' sulk Eolations between the present Sultan and the Agency have remained friendly and even cordial, in spite of some differences of opinion in the affair of the deportation of Ali Musa^ of which more hereafter. Very sincere efforts have undoubtedly been made in the direction of reform, especially in the matter of the local administration of justice and of the Customs, perhaps the two directions in which it was chiefly needed It would appear that the present Sultan is too much inclined to rely solely on the advice of Zubair and Ahmed as Shubaili. These men are both of Arab extraction but the latter has acquired British nationality and is well known in Bombay. He is a man of some ability and business knowledge. Zubair seems to be little beyond a successful courtier. Of His Highness' brothers, Saiyid Muhammad bin Faisal seems to have some influence and has the general reputation of being the clever boy of the family. Saiyid Nadir seems to have some strength of character and the Magisterial work of Maskat falls chiefly on his shoulders. Of Saiyid Hamad, the 4th son, we hear little in these days During the closing months of his life, Saiyid Paisal showed him some favour and it is possible that he is now paying the penalty. On the 23rd Pebruary, Saiyid Badar bin Sif, of the A1 Bu Said, who was known as the Commander-ia-Chief, died at Maskat. He was perhaps the most respectable member of the Sultan's entourage but did not appear to enjoy much influence or exercise any authority. The rising of the 'Oman tribes, under the leadership of the s^-called Tmam of Tanuf, Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, Condition of tie country. } las overshadowed all other events in 'Oman tribal history for the year under report. This rising was due to the preachings of the principal Ibadhi Shaikh, Abdullah bin Hamaid as Salimi. His method has been to misrepresent the Arms Warehouse as a subtle device of the English for depriving the 'Oman tribes of modern weapons and special ly of ammunition, so that they might reduce the tribes to impotence and then ride i oughshod over them. The first results of these machinations were the alarmist reports that reached Maskat, in the 3rd week uf May 1913, that Shaikh Abdullah as Salimi had set up his son-in-law, Salim-bin-Bashid, as ' Imam of the Muslimin The rebellion spread rapidly. Nizwah fell about the beginning of June and the Wali, Saiyid Saif bin Hammad, committed suicide, fearing to fall into the hands of the rebels. Izki and Awabi followed in the course of the month. After the fall of Izki, Shaikh Isa bin Salih al Harithi joined the rebel faction, whose principal temporal leader so far had been Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir and ^Nabhani, the Taminah of the Bani Biyam. On the 2nd July, Major Murphy, of the Intelligence Department arrived from Bushire to study the situation with a view to making arrangements, should necessity arise, for landing British troops for the defence of Matrah and Maskat. On the 6th of July, His Highness the Sultan appealed to the Political Agent for assistance and wrote officially to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in the same sense. By good fortune, His Majesty's ships 44 Philomel ' and 'Odin ' were in Maskat harbour, the ' Polorus' was on her way and the 3 ships received orders from His Exqcllency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to stand fast till the situation cleared. On the 9th July, a wing of the 2nd Bajputs, under command of Lieu tenant-Colonel Smith, arrived at Matrah from Bushire. At His Highness direct request, they were landed at Matrah and the next day occupied Baital JVaj, a hamlet near Matrah, with a picquet posted on Ruwi village,FOE THE YEAE 1915 105 His Highness proceeded to Sib on the 15th Julv anrl attempts at reasserting his authority but no serinL ^1.5 SOme feeble returned to his capital on the 24th July. 10118 fi ^ tln § of any kind, In the beginning of August the forts of Bidbid ^ q •, the hands of the rebels, and constant rumours of ti t&gt;a , mai1 passed into and Matrah were received. plans to attack Maskat On the 3rd September, the garrison at Bait al 'Pal,-: , , addition of a wing of the 102nd King Edward's Own rL (loubl e d by the date until the death of Saiyid Faisaf bin Turid no L^f 1618 ' . ^ this took place.

In the month of August, orders were received by the Political Agent and the Erench Consul from their respective Governments directing that an inventory of all Erench arms in private warehouses and the State Warehouse should be taken, that the arms contained in the private warehouses should be locked up therein and placed under the official seals of both Consuls. These instructions were carried out and stocks to the approximate value of £59,624 according to the French estimate and £42,937 according to the British estimate were inventoried and placed under seal. The result of these measures was to withdraw from circulation, so to speak, ajrms to the value of £33,000 or over. The Trench merchants announce that the negotiations regarding compensation for these stocks withdrawn have reached a successful conclusion, but no official corroboration of this statement has been received. In the month of October, the ill-considered export from the State Ware house of a large consignment of cartridges to the Bani Bu Ali tribe at Sur, before the usual shipping documents had been received and in defiance of the regulations, led to serious consequences for the chief delinquent, as in the month of December, His Highness the Sultan consented, after pressure, to the deportation and banishment of Ali Musa Khan the notorious Baluch arms trader, for a period of five years. The consignment of cartridges alluded to was his property and there was no doubt that it w as at his instigation that His Highness had consented to give peremptory directions to his Superintendent to allow this flagrant breach of the regulations. The prompt and stern remons trances of the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, who was then at Maskat, led to the immediate recall and re-deposit in the Warehouse of the cartridges in respect of which the breach of regulations had been committed, and in view of the prompt reparation made by His Highness Saiyid Taimur, the Govern ment of India were pleased to overlook his conduct and that of the Superintendent who, it is only fair to say, had done his best to withstand the pressure put upon him, but it was insisted that an example should be made of the chief offender. The banishment of this notorious arms trader has undoubtedly served to inspire all arms traders with a wholesome respect for the regulations of the State Warehouse and transactions with the Warehouse have practically ceased since his departure. It seems certain that the returns of the Maskat arms traffic will show an even greater diminution in the coming year and that the importance of Maskat as a distributing centre for this traffic will disappear. A comparative statement of prices for 1912-13 is attached. It naturally shows an enormous increase in the price of all goods of this description, but the figures are to this extent fallacious that, with the Warehouse Regulations, it would be difficult to find buyers, and a seller who based his estimates on these prices, would undoubtedly, be disappointed. Buyers, on the contrary, would have to submit to these extortionate prices. The public health has been, on the whole, good. In the month of December 13 w tt uv, xr ^ i a n r. there was an outbreak of small-pox in Health, Hospital and Quarantine. The AgeIlcy Hospital was open for the public and the number of patients treated during the 12 months is 6,017, the daily average being 40*28. The quarantine arrangements under the Agency Surgeon have worked well during the year. Two pilgrim ships called at Maskat during the year. Arrangements on . . board the ships were found satisfactoiy and therefore no trouble was experienced.

Eighteen patients were operated upon for cataract with good results in 17 and improved vision in one. Two cases of stone in the bladder were operated on, of which one was successful; the other unfortunately died on the succeeding day from Bronchitis. Two patients were operated upon for Appendicitis and two for Hernia, with satisfactory results. Only since the outbreak of smallpox have the people in Maskat and Matrah shown any desire to have their children vaccinated. Since the begin ning of December, 155 primary vaccinations have been performed. One case of smallpox was landed from a British India ship and treated in the Quaran tine station. The hospital buildings are in a fair state of repair, the supply of drugs and dressings have been adequate and several important instruments have been added to the equipment of the hospital. Major J. W. Little, has been in medical charge during the year, with Sub-Assistant-Surgeon J. F. Mascarenhas in sub-charge. The marked increase in the number of patients attending the hospital during the last two years is greatly due to the popularity of this Sub-Assistant Surgeon, who has been presented by the Surgeon-G-eneral to the Bombay Government, with half the ' Moore's Prize ' for good work, a reward much sought after by Sub- J.

There is little of interest to record during the past year on the Trucial Coast. The relations between the Chiefs of the seaports among themselves and between them and their Bedouin neighbours remained satisfactory. The Arms Traffic, of which mention was made in last year's report, has been reduced to such comparatively in- Arms traffic. significant proportions by the precaution ary measures taken at Maskat itself, that- there has not been any necessity to endeavour to induce the Trucial Shaikhs to take preventive measures against arms smugglers. The position remains exactly as it was Ras-ai-Khaimah. described last year. It has not been possible to effect a reconciliation between Shaikh Eashid and his half-brother Nasir. Shaikh Umm-ai-Kaiwam. Eashid's conduct has been anything but satisfactory and he has refused pointblank to obey the instructions he has received from this Eesidency through the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, whom he treated with scant respect. It seems that it will be necessary to coerce this Chief, who persists in refusing to grant justice to his half-brother. Ajman and Sharjah have no history for record this year. Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid, a fine looking and typical Arab Chief, who has only lately come info his Shaikh- Abu Dfchabi. t *1 i j i • • dom, appears to have governed his prin cipality wisely and well and is able to absent himself from his town for considerable periods. This may fairly be considered a criterion of whether an Arab Chief is firmly established or not. Shaikh Hamdan was invited by the Sultan of Maskat to come to his assistance with advice, if not men, against the rebels. He came to Maskat and stayed there till the end of the year. His pre sence may have afforded some moral support to His Highness Saiyid Taimur, but it is doubtful whether it seriously affected the situation there. His enter tainment certainly cost His Highness a round sum of money. While at Maskat, Shaikh Hamdan probably voiced the general apprehension which the success of the Amir at A1 Hasa caused among the Trucial Chiefs. Any rise in the fortunes of the ruler of Eiadh generally affects them immediately with anxiety on their own account, though every now and then, some temporarily dissatisfied Trucial Chief or Beadouin outlaw 7 conceives the brilliant idea of bringing in the Amir in the hope of fishing in troubled waters. An instance of this kind occurred during the year when the Chief of Ajman wrote an unnecessary letter to the Amir and the Political Eesident directed the Eesidency Agent, Sharjah, to repeat to the Trucial Chiefs the general warning already given to them to abstain from correspondence of this kind. There seems to be no present grounds for any anxiety on the part of the Maritime Chiefs as the Amir is fully occupied elsewhere. The death of Shaikh Butti bin Suhail was noted in the Administration D . ba . Eeport for 3912. There was the usual quarrelling among the deceased Shaikh s relatives over the succession, but a choice was happily effected without bloodshed or serious disturbance. Shaikh Said bin Maktum was elected by the family. The Eesident visited Dibai at the close of the previous year and recommended the recognition of the new Shaikh-elect. What might have proved an ' unfortunate incident' occurred in August, when a boat from H. M. S. 44 Sphinx' which was conveying the Besi-TOE THE YEAR 1913. 115 dency ? on . to the shore at Dibai, was fired at twice. Further shots were fired during the night and bullets fell near the ship, though not actually striking it Fortunately no one was hit. The occurrence was the m ore significant as Hts Majesty s Eesident was on board H. M. S ' Snhin*' a t the time. The Shaikh was summoned on board the next morning to expMn He came with his Wazier, Butti bin Rashid, and their demeanour was friendly apologetic and conciliatory ; the incident was eventually settled by the delivery to the Shaikh of a warning from the Government of India insisting on the deportation of the culprits to the Persian Coast and stating that the recurrence of such incidents must force Government to take serious measures to establish order in Dibai iwo Eastakis were eventually deported. The Administration Report of 1911 for the Trucial Coast mentions the p ir acy on a Dibai boat by Tangistams. During the year under report the latter tribe were dealt with by punitive measures which are recorded elsewhere The important point for Dibai is that, in November of this year, as a result of those measures, R15,000 were paid as compensation (blood-inoney) to the Shaikh of Dibai through the Residency Agent acting under the orders of this Residency. The question of a representative of the British India Steam Navigation Company proceeding to Dibai was eventually satisfactorily settled and a native of India, Mirza Muhammad, took up his residence there in January of this year and, in spite of some temporary disagreements with the Shaikh, of no great importance, appears to be gradually making his way there and strengthening the Company's position.

Major A. P Trevor, C.I.E., held charge of the Agency throughout the year. Assistant Surgeon G. K. Monani took six months leave to England in the spring, in order to go through a course at the London School of Tropical medicine. During his absence Assistant Surgeon S. S. Muhammadi of the Bombay Provincial Medical Survice, officiated in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital. This arrangement was possible by the fact that the Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital has been placed on the Cadre of the Bombay Provincial Medical Service; a step which has considerably improved the prospects of the incumbent. The reorganisation of the office and the introduction of the contract grant w ^ , system of finance, referred to in last year's report, have worked fairly well. It will, however, be difficult, if not impossible, to get junior clerks for the English and Vernacular Offices to stay on the pay offered on a non-pensionable footing as they can do so much better with firms and private offices. Application has been made for increased pay for these officers. Another drawback is the arrangement by which the Steam Launch stays 6 months at Bandar Abbas; considerable inconvenience was caused by its absence at the end of the year when the Political Agent had to go to the coast of the mainland on one occasion, and would have visited several other places on other occasions had the Launch been available. _ , The relations between the Agency and I{i6lB&gt;tions witn Shaikh Xsft* i i Shaikh Isa have been very friendly throughout the year, and no difficulties have arisen. As mentioned above, Assistant Surgeon G. K. Monani was absent on leave . , r ., „ , for 6 months of the vear, and his place was Victoria Memorial Hospital. , c* otct n/ri filled by Assistant Surgeon S. S. Munam- madi from Bombay. The Victoria Memorial Hospital did very good work during the year, the attendance being a ' record.' The actual figures, as compared with 1909, the previous highest, are given below:— Tear. Indoo'. Outdoor. Total. 1909 98 4,876 4 ; 974 1913 78 5,252 5,330 This increase was to a great extent due to the fact that, for the greater part of the summer, the Hospital of the American Mission was closed. I)r. and Mrs. Worrall, the Physician-in-charge and his wife (who is also a Doctor), left Bahrain for India in May and, except for July and part of August when Dr. Harrison from Kuwait came as a substitute, no doctor was with the Mission until December after the Annual Meeting of the Mission to decide postings, etc., when Dr. Harrison was appointed Physician-in-charge. The fact that the Mission Hospital w r as closed naturally affected the Victoria Memorial Hospital; the capture of the Hasa Province by Bin Sand was another factor. During the summer quite a number of gun shot wounds were treated.POR THE YEAR 1918, ny As there was a considerable amount of rain during the early part of the Agency buildings. year the Agency buildings were very , uncomfortable, the rain going through to the ground floor m many places. Plans and estimates were submitted for new buildings, in April, but the question is still under consideration as the Govern ment of India have called for a further report as to whether the existing build ings are capable of repair and improvement. 0 The detachment of the 2nd (Q.

Shaikh Isa and Family. ■'■ Sa . ^ man y Ways SCCmS younger ... , . than he did 10 years ago, and frequently spends long days hawking and shooting without overtaxing his strength. Shaikh Hamad made his usual hawking expedition to Lingah in the autumn; on this occasion he was accompanied by Shaikh Muhammad, the second son of the Shaikh. Khalifah bin Hamad bin Muhammad A1 Khalifah returned to Bahrain shaikh isa and his relations. during the year. Soon after his arrival he apparently began intriguing with the Turkish Postmaster, but this official left soon after Bin Saud took Hasa in May. Khalifah called on the Political Agent and tried to enlist the latter's sympathy with tales of Shaikh Isa's tyranny, etc., but he received no encouragement in that quarter, and he has now apparently ceased from troubling, at all events temporarily, as nothing has been heard of him since then. One or two letters were received by Shaikh Isa from the Wali of Basrah shaikh Isa and the w.u of Basrah. ™ theearly part of the year and were shown by the Shaikh to the Political Agent before an answer was sent. The Political Agent suggested that, in view of the fact that the Turkish Government were giving up their pretensions to Bahrain, the Porte might be requested to instruct its officers in the Gulf not to communicate direct with Shaikh Isa any longer; the proposal however was not approved. With reference to the remarks in the last report regarding the proceedings , of Haii Abdun Nabi Karbalai 'Awaz, Bahrain subjects abroad. , ,, , , „ ,, 5 this individual was called before the Kesident in November and warned not to issue ' Tazkirah ' passes in future. He vehemently asseverated and took oath that he would never do such a thing again, but it remains to be seen whether he will keep his promise. The Politi cal Agent has since been signing ' Tazkirah' passes for Persian subjects returning to Persia. Up to the end of the year, as far as is known, Haji Abdun Nabi did not break his promise. No flag was flown on the Island, either a numya ' Turkish or Arab. Some Dosiris visited the place in the autumn. During the year considerable improvements were made in the Customs premises. An upper storey was built on us oin8 ' the actual Customs House for the use of the Director and for the accommodation of any special ' Majlis ^ The room is a very good one and makes an excellent place for any important official visitor to pay a return visit to the Shaikh, if time does not permit of a trip to Maharraq. The new Customs shed was railed in at the sides and a fairly large yard enclosed outside. The pier was built out to over 600 feet and will, it is hoped, soon be completed to 800 feet when it will accommodate cargo boats except at very low tides. A passenger jetty is also being built at a little distance from the pier, and between the two there will eventually be quite a good little boat basin. Seth Naraindas Tikamdas of the firm of Gangaram Tikamdas, who was Director of Customs up to almost the end of the year, is responsible to a great extent for these improvements, and deserves great credit.113 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT At the end of 1912, the Government of India directed that the Shaikh T ^ , should be required to submit proposals for Landing arrangements. i. p j i i i 1 - J^^r the improvement of the landing arrange ments without delay. He was asked to do this at the beginning of 1913, and his proposals were sent up by the Political Agent early in Eebruary. The main features were that the Agents of Shipping Companies should be given the option of landing cargo brought by their Companies' steamers on payment of 5 per cent, on the gross landing fces, that the Shaikh should appoint a Ware house Superintendent who would receive the goods from the Companies' Agents at the jetty, sort and store them, and issue them to the consignees, who would themselves undertake the removal of the goods to their houses or warehouses. It was first proposed to give this conoession to shipping companies for 5 years, but the time was subsequently increased to 10 years. The Shaikh duly appointed his Customs Director to supervise with a Warehouse Superintendent under him and, as a temporary measure, nominated one of his employes Ali bin Abdullah to run the boat arrangements. Up to the end of the year, however, the Shaikh's proposals had not been approved and the temporary landing arrangemfmts are still going on at considerable loss to the Shaikh and inconvenience to the public. The arrangements when once the cargo is landed are now working well, and are a great improvement on those made by the old inefficient Landing Contractors. The contract of the last Landing Contractor, Abdul Karim Khadim, expired on 6th April 1913 and, as mentioned above, his work was split up and the shore arrangements were put in the charge of the Director of Customs and the actual landing in charge of Ali bin Abdullah. The special Majlis referred to in last year's report sat frequently about the end of Abdul Karim's time and afterwards and settled a good many claims. Several claims are still outstanding against him, and Messrs. Gray Paul and Coy. have not been able to get their accounts of cargo of steamers, etc., settled up with him yet. He is a hopeless person to have any business with. The local interest in this war soon waned and the vast majority of the T . .. population very soon, after the beorinnins' Interest m the Balkan War. p ji j t i 0 ^ oi the year, realized that the sum of El,0.1,000, referred to in last year's report as having been remitted to Constan tinople, might easily have been better spent.

On the 4th May, a rather serious fight took place between Basris and Foreign Bad Characters in Bahrain. Kurdis ia the Bazaar. _ A large proportion or the Basris m Bahrain are bad characters who have been obliged to leave Basrah. As a result of the row it was possible to call on several of the worst characters to give security for good behaviour, and since that time various steps have been taken against the bad characters with the result that they have not given any trouble during the last 4 or 5 months. It is hoped that this state of affairs will continue since they now, as the Chief Kazi says, ' have had bits put in their mouths.' On the whole the Agency has been on good terms with the Shaikh's Position of Agency. officials and the Chief Kazi and the popula tion generally. There have not been any cases which excited acute feeling. Salih bin Eashid, the S£ Amir' ? of Manamah, who is a sort of Deputy shaikhs officers Governor or Prefect of the town under the Shaikh, had long been a 4 bete-noire ' of the Agency. It is understood that this gentleman was never a good &lt;4 Amir' even in his younger days, but for many years past, age and infirmity had made him quite incapable of performing his duties at all. This, combined with the fact that he could not read or write and would never keep up any office establish ment, rendered work with him very trying. It is satisfactory to be able to state that the Shaikh has at last removed him from his post. The ' AmirFOR THE YEAR 1913. 119 of Maliarraq, All bm Husam al Kumri, a much more active and efficient man has been transferred to Manamah while lahad bin Jalal, one of the Fidawis of Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa, has been made Amir of Maharran. The former seems to be doing well, and bis presence in Manamah will assist in keeping the Foreign bad cbaracters, referred to above, in order. The latter is reported to be very strict and for tbis reason to have fallen foul of the Shaikh's con fidential factotum Ah bin Abdulla, but otherwise he seems to have started well. The only two events of any public interest connected with Bahrain durins the year occurred on the mainland, and come under the headin 0 * External ^ These were:— (1) The expulsion of the Turks from the Hasa Province by Shaikh Abdul Aziz Bm Saud, Amir of Neid, in May, and (2) The death of Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad el Thani, Euler of Katr in July. On the 8th May news was received in Bahrain that Abddul Aziz bin Hasa and Katif. Saud had seized the town of Hasa. Later information showed that, on the niffht of the 5th May, Bm Saud with a comparatively small following attacked the town Aided by adherents mside and the pusillanimicy of the Mutassarif and other Turkish Officers, Bin Saud's men speedily captured the town, and even the citad-el known as ' Kut ' did not offer any serious resistance There was some fighting round one of the gates of the tow a in which a certain number of men were killed and wounded on both sides. After capturing the town. Bin Saud sent the Mutassarif and other officials off to Ojair and the iurkish garrison, numbering about 500 men, were allowed to proceed there also. The first refugees from Hasa reached Bahrain on the 10th May 1913, and the Mutassarif with other officers arrived on the 12th. It was arranged that the S S. ' John O Scott' (an old British cargo boat now owned by Kasim Kha- dhairi of Basrah and sailing under the Turkish flag) which happened to be in Bahrain, should go to Ojair and fetch the Turkish troops, the intention then being to send them all hack to Basrah at once. This was, however, frustrated by the activity of Major Nuris Bey who arrived in Bahrain, en route for Hasa to take command of the garrison there, on the 9th May, just in time to hear of Bin Saud's success. This officer, who had just come from the Balkans, was naturally much against .evacuating Katif and giving up the province of Hasa without striking another blow, so when, on the llth May, the 'John O Scott ' returned with the troops from Ojair, he took the vessel over to Katif on the 16th, with the intention of assisting the garrison there to resist Bin Saud. He found, however, that the place had already been handed over to Bin Saud's forces, and so brought back the Turkish garrison who were being sent away in boats. On various pretexts such as want of coal, lack of water and other things the 'John O. Scott' remained in Bahrain with some (400j four hundred men on board. On two or three occasions Nuris Bey said that the ship would return at once to Basrah, but she did not do so. On the 25th May, a party of 3 officers and about 30 gunners arrived from Katr with a field gun, and having received this reinforcement Major Nuris Bey hired a number of Tangistani and other boats in harbour and started off to recapture Ojair on the 26th with all the avilable men, numbering some four to five hundred. The troops, however, had no stomach for any fighting and when they landed on the 27th May were easily beaten off by the Arabs and retired to their boats with some losses. An officer and about 60 men were surrounded in a tower and would probably have been killed by the Arabs, if Bin Saud had not arrived in person, on ^he 28th, and sent the party back to Bahrain. In the meanwhile Major Nuris Bey had been superseded by Colonel ^hdul Jabbar Bey who had arrived on tho 23rd May to negotiate with Saud. However, he w r as not able to achieve anything and eventually, on ^he 1st June, the ct John O. Scott ' left for Basrah with the Turkish troops.120 PERSIAN GrXJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Xhiring the stay of these Turkish troops there was some excitement in Bahrain and there was considerable chance of rows occurring between them and the local Nejdi population. It was, therefore, suggested that His Majes- ty's Government might be moved to inform the Porte that Turkish troops would not in future be allowed to use Bahrain as a base for operations on the mainland. Directly he took over the de facto administration of the province of Hasa and the coast towns Bin Saud entered into correspondence with the Resident, and with the Political Agent, Bahrain, with a view to re-establishing what he called the ' friendly relations which had existed between the British Govern ment and his forebears. ,, In the course of this correspondence Shaikh Abdul Aziz expressed a desire to meet the Political Hesident, so Sir Percy Cox sug gested to him that he should come to the coast for a meeting when the Resi de ut visited Bahrain about the 20th November 1913. Unfortunately the Resident's letter found Bin Saud at Kasim, at the other end of his territory, and it was impossible for him to reach Bahrain in time. During the Resident's visit on the 21st November a messenger arrived from Bin Sciud saying that he regretted he could jiot come in time and adding that he would reach the coast about the 10th Moharram (11th December). This was, of course, too late for Sir Percy Cox and it was arranged that the Political Agent, Bahrain, accompanied by Captain Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, should go over to Ojair and meet Bin Saud when he reached the coast. Accordingly, having heard from Bin Saud that he would be at Ojair on the 15th December, the Political Agent accompanied by Captain Shakespear left Bahrain on the moming of the Mth and reached Ojair early on the ]5th. Bin Saud, who had arrived about half an hour before, received the Political Agent on the quay and was most courteous and polite. Major Trevor and Captain Shakespear spent that day and the next in Bin Saud's camp and were most hospitably entertained. The camp broke up and Bin Saud left for Nejdi about daylight of the 17th, the Political Agent setting sail shortly after. Bin Saud was evidently anxious to obtain the good offices of His Majes ty's Government in settling his dispute with the Turkish Government and expressed himself ready to meet the wishes of Government. He issued orders to his e&lt; Amir ' at Katif to help and protect British Traders, and to settle their cases and claims (and those of British Proteges also) in consultation with the Political Agent, Bahrain. The Political Agent and Captain Shakespear got back to Bahrain on the evening of the 18th December, having been delayed by calms and a con trary wind. Since the occupation of the Hasa Province by Bin Saud this route has „ m n „ ^ been practically safe, and caravans have Oiair-Hasa Trade Route. , 1 &lt;» i rrn -n i • been passing freely. The Bedouin rob bers are at present too much afraid of Bin Saud to attempt any raids on cara vans. Doubtless this fear will wear off, but it is certain that the state of the road will be better under Bin Saud's regime than the Turks ; it could not, in any case, be worse. After the Amir Abdul Aziz Bin Saud took Hasa Province there Katr seemed to be considerable probability that he would overrun Katr also, and Shaikh Jasim was in considerable trepidation, especially as some con nections of Bin Saud's, the Araif family, who had been intriguing against him, had taken refuge in Katr. Some correspondence passed between Shaikh Abdul Aziz and Shaikh Jasim, in which the former called upon the latter to turn out the Turkish garrison and give up the Araif, but Shaikh Jasim de clined to do either, the first because he hoped the Turkish garrison would he some protection, and the second because it was against Arab usage. Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad Ath Thani died on the 17th July 1913, after a short illness, at a very great age. He was succeeded by his second son Shaikh Abdullah who had for a number of years been Governor of the port ofFOE THE TEAR 1913. ^ Doliah and his father's right hand man. To this fact no doubt Shaikh Abdullah owed his peaceful succession. &lt;U1 The Resident visited Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasimin August, and informed him of the general trend of the negotiations between Great Britain and Turkey in so far as they referred to Katr. J Up to the end of the year the Porte had not removed the Turkish garrison from Katr. The detachment is believed to be 200 men. Towards the end of the year the Turkish Gun Boat « Marmaris ' visited Katr on several occasions From what one hears it seems that the idea prevails in Katr that the pro vince will be handed over from Turkish to British protection and the pros pect apparently does not commend itself to the people. Shaikh Abdullah has been uniformly friendly m his correspondence with the Political Agent and shows signs of being anxious to please the British Government. piracies. -^ 0 piracies of Bahrain boats were reported during the year. It was not possible to get this case settled as, by the time Nasir-ut-Tuwar Fuwairat case of 1912 could ^ be prevailed 'upon to come to ^ . Bahrain, th^ Somali Nakhuda and crew had left the (xulr and it was impossible to make a proper enquiry into the case Shaikh Nasir was present several times in the Agency, but no news could be obtained of the Somalis, so eventually the surety mentioned in last year's report was cancelled. Nothing of any interest in connection with the Arms Traffic occurred at Arms Traffic, Bahrain during the year. Further correspondence took place with reference to the limitation of arms carried by pearling dhows, and finally it was suggested to the Shaikh that all sailing craft belonging to Bahrain, including pearling dhows should be given certificates showing the nature of the craft, name of Nakhuda, number of crew, number of arms carried and other particulars. The Shaikh, however, demurred strongly to introducing any such new-fangled procedure and the gist of his objections was submitted to higher authority, since which nothing further has been heard of the matter. slave We. Thirteen slaves were manumitted during the year without any special difficulty arising. With reference to this case the man Abdur Eahiin bin Mirza of Chiru Sale of three Somali boys. eame before the Political Agent in con nection with another claim made against nim while he was on a casual visit to Bahrain. His name being an unusual one, enquiries were made and he was found to be the man who had purchased the three Somali boys whose case was referred to in last year's report. After being detained at Bahrain for some little time in connection with the other case against him Abdul Rahim bin Mirza was sent to Bushire for disposal on the 18th May 1913. Nothing was heard here of the Bahrain Order-in-Council till November Bahrain order -in-Goundi. wlien the Political Agent received a copy of the Order, which had been issued on the 12th August, from a book-seller. Shortly after this, however, instructions were received to the ellect that the Older would not be put into force at present. In view of the undoubted increase of work which the Order will bring and ibe excessive amount of work which the small office has to do at present, the rolitical Agent submitted some proposals for an increase to the Aeencv •establishnmt. ^ wireless station. No Progress was made with this scheme during the year. It is not necessary to touch on these matters which are dealt with at length Commercial and shipping. in the Trade Reports. During the year two gas buoys, which had been sent by Government, Ga8 buoyg were laid down at the entrance of Bahrain harbour. The outer buoy,122 PEESIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT flashing white was fixed by E. I. M.

When Bin Saud took Hasa, however, he left and has not returned since. The regular Postal Service has been sus pended since that time. Mr. Hoist, who had been Manager for about three years, left Bahrain on leave on the 29th August 1913, being Wonctiiaus and Coy. succeeded by Mr. George Harling who had been his assistant for four months before he left. Dr. Worrall was senior member of the Mission during the early part of the vear. Some dissensions, the nature of || American Mission. which never became public, arose in the Mission and resulted in Dr. Worrall going on leave to India in a hurry in May 1913.

The disposal of cases has been rendered somewhat less difficult recently owing to the fact that the old Amir of Manamah has at last been removed an active Amirs have now been appointed both in Manamah and Maharraq. There is consequently some improvement in the production of ^ parties an witnesses. It is hoped that matters will continue to improve in this direction. The Chief Kazi, Shaikh Jasim bin Mehza, continued to deal satisfactorily with cases referred to him. The Salifah Judge Muhammad bin Fadhal also did very good work. ^ In the autumn an effort was made to dispose of a number of the old a ministration cases lying with the Majlis-ul-Urfi, and a lot of estates of deceFOS THE TEAR 1913. ^23 persons, bankrupts and absconders were, in fact, wound up and dividends distributed. The special Majlis met several times during the year in connection with cases against the late Landing Contractor, Abdul Karim Khadim, whose con tract expired at the end of March. A considerable number of claims are still outstanding against this individual. A table of the cases dealt with by the Political Agent is appended to this report. There was good rain in the early part of the year, and the hot weather climate . was not at all a severe one. The et Barih Shamal ' lasted a long time during the hot weather, and in fact considerably interfered with the pearl diving. A memorandum on the Meteorological conditions of the year kindly fur nished by Dr. Harrison of the American Mission, who is in charge of the Meteorological instruments, is attached to this report. There was no epidemic of plague or cholera during the year. This was H ^ lth&lt; very fortunate particularly as the sequence of epidemics of plague every other year, which has prevailed since 1905, was broken. Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade and a party of Geologists and Petro- v isitors&lt; leum Experts visited this Island in the autumn. They arrivedin H. M.

His Excellency Eear-Admiral E. H. Peirse, C.B., M.V.O., Naval Com mander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, paid an official visit in H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' to Bahrain on the 7th December. On the morning of the next day (the Admiral having arrived on a Sunday), Shaikh Isa paid an official visit to His Excellency and received a salute of 11 guns on leaving. Shortly afterwards His Excellency returned the Shaikh's call at the Manamah Customs House, the new upper storey having been tem porarily converted into a reception room. It makes a very convenient place Jor such calls as it can be easily reached at all states of the tide and saves a frip to Maharraq. At the conclusion of the visit a salute of 15 guns was fired. Hia Excellency left Bahrain on 9th December 1913. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Eesident, Persian Gulf, paid a visit to Bahrain on the 21st and 22nd November on board the R. I.

Harrison, M D,, of the American Mission. The year of 1913, as shown by the Bahrain records, has been one of moder ate temperatures, scanty rainfall and comparative freedom from high winds. The maximum temperature for the year was registered, July 15th, and was 103-2 0 . Eight times in the course of the year, temperatures higher than 100° were reported The year's minimum temperature was registered on February ^ 5th, a temperature of The rainfall of the year amounted to only 8 35 inches. All of this except about one-half an inch fell in the months of January and February, over two- thirds of the year's total being in the latter month. There was a slight shower in May. A total of inches *54 fell in December. It has not been a year of violent storms. Only thirteen times in the course of the year was a wind velocity as high as twenty miles per hour record ed On February 23rd, there was recorded a velocity of thirty miles, which was the most violent wind of the year. The usual winds have been very light, and the sea calm.

Politically the year 1913 has been of more than usual importance in the history of Kuwait but, from an economic point of view, it was rather unsatisfactory, for the anticipations of a dry year in last year's report unhappily proyed to be true and a bad pearl season further aggravated the depression of local merchants. The caravan routes, however, were safe throughout the year, but the desert, nearly everywhere, was barren and the condition of the cattle and live-stock consequently poor, leading to a comparatively small trade with Bedouin. A bad pearl-season bears particularly hardly upon the poorer classes and those who are improvident were to be seen selling their women's jewellery, household goods and -even garments in order to make both ends meet. The ensuing year, so far at least as the desert tribes and people are concern ed, promises a better outlook, for fairly heavy rains have been reported in the hinterland, a fact which, together with a mild winter, usually means ample grazing for flocks and herds. The total rainfall registered at the Agency Observatory was only 3 inches and 13 cents, which is much below the Climate and Rainfall. « ■ rrn average of past years. The summer was unusually mild and late, for the highest maximum temperature recorded during the year was 113-5 for the 18th August, and September proved to be the only really oppressive month. The lowest minimum temperature recorded was SO 1 8 for the 6th Eebruary as against 24 7 and 36 0 in 191] and 1912, respectively. An extract prepared from the Agency daily meteorological observations forms an Appendix to this report. In the beginning of January a Khan' or 'Kapandari' of which one Khalil bin Ebrahim Khattan had the farm for some B4i,000 for 3 years, was re- farmed by the Shaikh to one Jasim bin Mahammad Budai for E7,000. The probable reason for this large advance was some private ill-feeling between the old and new farmers for the Shaikh took the unusual course of cancelling Khalil's agreement and refunding the proportion due for the unexpired portion of his farm when he accepted Jasim's higher bid. In the 3rd week of April it was reported that some Katif (or Katr) Arabs, who came to buy wool, ghi, sheep, etc., from A wazim Arabs on the coast south of Kuwait, were summarily dealt with by Shaikh Salim bin Mubarak. It appears that, for fiscal purposes, it is necessary that all such purchases should be made in Kuwait town and to prevent a recurrence of such practices Shaikh SaUm confiscated all that these Katif (or Katr) Arabs had, excepting only their boats, and ' sent them empty away.' Garbled reports having reached Kuwait, in May, of a settlement between the British and Turkish Governments regarding the Baghdad Eailway, under which the terminus would be at Kuwait, a number of merchants have been acquiring sites from the Shaikh on the foreshore west of the town, at rates distinctly remunerative to the Shaikh. At the instance of Shaikh Nasir bin Mubarak and some young Arabs with -4 u, t J.. .. 'soi-disanf aspirations to progress, a chantabie institutions. charitable fund was opened, in Eebruary, with the laudable object of importing a Muhammadan doctor for a free dispensary, to provide funds for supplying water free of cost to deserving P oor and for granting free passages by steamer to distressed Muhammadans, etc., etc. Over 82,000 was said to hav® been subscribed and a house given as aPOR THE YEAR 1913. 127 -fu^e or 'dharamsala'. The yearly subscription to the fund for those willing to subscribe was fixed at not less than R6 each. In March it was stated that efforts were being made to obtain the services of Assistant Surgeon Davud-ur- Kahman Khan who is a Sunni Muhammadan and, when in medical charge of the Kuwait Political Agency during 1904-1907, was held in high esteem by local Arabs. Later, however, Shaikh Mubarak brought a Turkish doctor by name Asad Beg from Basrah as his personal medical attendant and placed him incharge of the new charitable dispensary. After a visit to Bombay, during which Asad Beg purchased some R5,000 worth of medicines and surgical instruments, charitable work at the dispensary began. In October he accompa nied the Shaikh to Eailiyah and there resigned his appointment.' The Arab dispensary being without a doctor the Shaikh eventually sent the medicines and instruments left in the dispensary to Basrah and disposed of them for some 182,000 only. It seems fairly evident that Dr. Asad Beg succeeded in lining Ms pockets to no small extent during the short period he was in Kuwait. The scheme at the outset was not received very favourably by the elders of the town who said that they should have been consulted, and its collapse was no great surprise. Mr. E. H. Pascoe of the Geological Survey of India arrived, in February, to Water Supply P reliniin ary investigations for a water-supply scheme, a reference to which was made in last year's report. In connection with this he visited Bandar Shuwaikh, Kubbar Island, Warah Hill and adjacent places in order to obtain geological data as to strata and formations. The matter is still under consideration with the Government of India and, up to the date of this report, no decision had been reached as to whether a supply from artesian well-borings or from a sea water condensing plant would be the more advantageous. The matter is an important one, in which an early decision is much to be desired. At the beginning of August there was one serious water-famine owing to a strong ' Shamal ' which lasted 10 days preventing the sailing of any boats. A new tank-steamer, ' Saeed ', ordered by the Shaikh from the Clyde to supply water to the town from the Shat-el-Arab arrived on the 16th October. It is improbable that she will be able to cope with the requirements of the town but, when she took up her duties, it was found that she was more success ful than was at first anticipated, for she could deliver over 300 tons of water every 3 or 4 days. The Shaikh has not kept her regularly at the duty for which she was imported and she is now undergoing alterations with a view to making her more of a yacht or passenger vessel. Up to the end of the year the postal work of the town has been performed ^ ^ by the Political Agent's office, but it is Postal Mat ter«. j .' o j . i. ^ ± a j. n satisfactory to observe that all arrange ments are in an advanced state and that the inauguration of a regular Indian Inland Post Office at Kuwait will take place as soon as the Anglo-Turkish Convention is published. The exchange of the Maria Theresa dollar fluctuated between R151| and 145 per 100 dollars from January to xchatlge * May. In June it began to rise steadily until it reached R154-8 per cent, in October when the boats returned from the pearl fisheries ; subsequently it declined to E.148 per cent. in. December. Sove reigns, rupees, annas and copper pice were exchanged throughout the year at their par values. The anniversary of the birthday of His Majesty the King-Emperor was celebrated on the 3rd June by the distri- e e rations. bution of alms to the poor and the dress ing of the Agency and Shaikh's flagstaffs. In the evening the Agency was illuminated and a reception held by the Political Agent which Shaikhs Jabir and Salim and other members of the Shaikh's family, and all the leading men in Kuwait attended. The usual congratulatory visits were paid by the Political Agent to mem bers of the Shaikh's family and some of the leading men on the Id-ul-Pitr on the 2nd and 3rd September.128 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT The town continues to be thoroughly well governed under the strong rule of Shaikh Mubarak and with fKp Law and Crime. ,. p x • -i , exception ot the two incidents noted below, no serious crime, disturbances or robberies have taken place during the year under report. A disturbance took place in the Agency premises on the night of the 9th Eebruary, three strange drunken Arabs causing a fight. They were tied up and handed over to the Shaikh, who imprisoned them for a short sentence after administering a severe beating. An Arab, by name Khalid bin Khamis, who was formerly a pilot in the British India steamers, murdered one of his male slaves on the night of the 17th March. Khalid, it appears, was drunk at the time and, on his slave endeavouring to prevent him from going out of the house became annoyed, took a revolver and shot the slave, whose body was then thrown into an under ground latrine in the house: In the morniag the slave's wife, who was living in the same house, reported the crime to Shaikh Jabir. The latter arrested and imprisoned the murderer, confiscated all his property and subsequently ex pelled him from Kuwait. The caravan roads to Nejd were particularly safe throughout the year and caravans have been leaving regularly for and arriving from Zilfi, Buraidah, Anaizah, Hail, Shaqrah, etc. Capture of JELasa by Bin Saud. —The most important event in Nejd affairs this year has been the ejectment of the Turks from the Hasa and Katif province by Abdul Aziz bin Abclur Bahman ' Bin Saud ', the Amir of Nejd, news of his occupafr'on of the above places reaching Kuwait from Bahrain, on the 15tli May. In July it was reported that he had also occupied Kasr-as-Subaih and that he had appointed one Bin Mandil as his deputy find governor there. The Customs duties, it was said, had been fixed at 4 per cent, on goods imported by sea. It was also stated that the Customs receipts at Katif had been farmed by him to one Bin Earis of that place for $50,000, for the remaining period of the current Arabic year. Bin Saud remained at Hasa for about two and a half months to consoli date his position and then left for Biyadh. Bumours were current in Kuwait that the Sharif of Mecca and Ibn Rashid, at the instigation of the Turks, were contemplating an attack on Bin Saud, but subsequent reliable information proved that Ibn Sabhan, the guardian of Ibn Bashid and dp, facto Buler of Hail, was on excellent terms with Bin Saud. As regards the Sharif, negotiations between him and Bin Saud to re-open the Haji Boute from Nejd (closed for the last two years), were successful and there was every prospect of the Sharif and Bin Saud coming to an agreement of mutual benefit. No advance or overt action has hitherto b«en taken by the Sharif or his family, while frequent messages of good-will and presents have been exchanged. One result of Bin Saud's assumption of authority in the Hasa and Katif districts has been to bring him within the sphere of Gulf politics immediately affecting British interests. A meeting between him and the Besident haying failed to take place owing to Bin Saud's distance from the coast at the time, another was arranged and took place on the 15th and 16th December at Ojair, when the Political Agent, Bahrain, accompanied by the Political Agent, Kuwait, represented the Besident - Various matters were discussed and Bin Saud showed himself to be exceedingly friendly and anxious to do all that he could to meet British suggestions. Bin Saud's Baids. —In March it was reported that Bin Saud had raided the Shair section of the A jrnan tribe, east of Biyadh, and that he had with him at least a thousand of the townsmen from Nejd' villages, as w r ell as Bedouin of the Kahtan, Sabai, Mutair, and some sections of the Ajman tribes. Alter having successfully raided the Al-Morrah tribe in April, to the south-west Hasa, he rested his force of some 600 to 700 men at Khafs (50 miles north o Riyadh), with the intention, it was stated, of raiding northwards againstFOE THE TEAR igjg. Ataibah tribe before returning to his capital. Later events proved, however that bis objective was really the Turkish garrison at Hasa and the ejectment of all Turks from Eastern Arabia. ojcoumeni Ibn Bashid's Raids —In the 2nd week of May, it was stated fh,! Ibn Rasbid had raided some sections of the Ataibah tribe some 90 miles South West of Hail m he vicmity of Jabal Muwashan. It appears the Ataibah had previously raided the Harb tribe, who are Ibn Eashid's followers, and had refused to make restitution of the loot. ' ^ TheAraif. During the year the Araif (cousins of Bin Saud), have made n o move nor succeeded in causing any diversions; some of them are still in sanctuary with the Sharif of Mecca and the Katr Shaikhs. The year has been a lean one for the desert tribes for the want of the later Tribal Politics. precluded the possibility of a ffood . , , , ,.*? dder /?f' r i an( i consequent scantiness of herbage much lowered the condition of Bedouin flocks, herds and cattle The Political Agent m the course of his spring tour, however, found that further south conditions were better, the country having received a fair amount of rain and Bedouin of the Mutair, Sabai, and Kahtan tribes were all in the vicinity of the Dahanah ridge and southern Summan district, while their cattle appeared to be in first class condition. The country, however, showed the want of rain and such herbage as there was had already dried up in April with the approach of the hot weather. The desert north of the Summan tract as far as Kuwait was almost bare of herbage practically no rain having fallen since January. Raids and counter-raids have not been frequent among the tribes for the same reason as given in previous reports, viz the friendly relations existino between Shaikh Mubarak, Bin Saud and Ibn Eashid. Some of the tribes even complain that, with these rulers so firm in their alliances, their own principal occupation, that of raiding, is gone. Bedouin Shaikhs.—A number of Bedouin Shaikhs visited the Political Agent at various times of the year, among them being Mutlaq bin Mahailab, Haif bm Azah bin Ishqair and Bandar bin Naif bin Ishqair, Shaikhs of the Mutair tribe, who called on the Political Agent in January. The Mutair Tribe.—At the end o£ July it was reported that Mandil Ibn Ghanaiman of the Malaibah section of the Mutair had raided the Safran sec tion of the ^ jman tribe at Makah taking over 200 camels, the casualties beino- one man killed on each side. The Ajman 2 7 n^.—News was received in the 3rd week of February, that a party of the Ajman who had gone to raid the Mutair tribe near Haniyah found some of the Bashaidah encamped in the vicinity and attacked them killing three men and looting all their camels. The loss on their side was said to have been two men and two horses killed. This raid impaired the good relations between the Ajman and Bin Saud and Shaikh Mubarak and was due to the weakness of their Shaikhs, the Hithlain family, in being unable to restrain their younger warriors. Two small parties of Ajman and Mutair Bedouins came into collision near v&gt;ara Hill, on the 16th Juae, apparently with little damage to either side. At the end of July, it was reported that Adh-Dhamir, a Shaikh of the Ajman tribe, had raided some 500 to 600 camels belonging to the Tawatah TOion of the Anizah tribe allied to Shaikh Mubarak at Safwan. Shaikh Mubarak, it was stated, had written to Bin Saud, to punish the raiders and enrorce restitution of the looted camels, which was duly carried out later in the year. &lt;51 Tribe- —News was received in the second week of February, that aikn Ajaimi bin Sadun of the Muntafik with the Adh-Dawish section of the so 11 ^ qaa ^ 0 ' ra ^ e( i Ba'adur, a sub-section of the Muntafik and that nf it n camels were taken as loot.

The Shaikh took great personal *fLt in the preliminary arrangements and the proceedings and expressed in warmest terms his thanks and appreciation in being honoured with so the * anu ...i, TTic Mainstv's favour. Shortly before the arrival of Sir Edmond Slade with a commission of • eana oil Field 00—.. f ^perts the Shaikh willingly gave a Mining and ui document binding himself not to lease rant any concessions for oil-wells except with the concurrence and on the Commendation of His Majesty's Government. He was also most active nd helpful in furthering the investigations of the Oil Commission. An unusually large number of British Indians visited Kuwait during the nr &lt; , nme for trading purposes, but the majority as drivers, these latter beinff from the Malabar Coast. The most important event of the year has been the signature of the .. Anglo-Turkish Convention after negotia- Angio-Turkxsh onveu ion. tions which have extended over two years. The Convention deals comprehensively with the whole sphere of Persian Gulf politics, but the portions more nearly affecting Kuwait m^y be summarized as follows:— (a) The Porte's claim to suzerainty over Kuwait is admitted together with the right to appoint a Turkish Agent for the protection of Turkish nationals to reside in Kuwait. (b) The Porte admits and recognizes the validity of all agreements between the British Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait. (c) The confines of the Kuwait Principality are defined and include an area some 200 miles long from north to south and 150 miles from east to west. (d) The Porte accords the Shaikh an almost absolute autonomy, agreeing to abstain from any interference in external and internal affairs or in questions of the succession. (e) The two Powers are agreed that, should the Baghdad Eailway be prolonged to Kuwait, arrangements as to the Customs duties, facilities, etc., at the terminal port and in connection with the railway within Kuwait boundaries shall not be conipleted without full consultation with the British Government. (/) The Shaikh will be entitled a Turkish Kaimmakam and the Porte will also so entitle each succeeding Shaikh by Imperial Pirman. The Convention was, on the whole, fairly well received by the Shaikh though he was at first much perturbed at the clauses permitting the residence of a Turkish Agent, and requiring the recognition^ of each succeeding Shaikh by Imperial Eirman. He was also uneasy as to his rights regarding Customs duties, etc., under the clause regarding the possible prolongation of the Bagndad Eailway. He was eventually reassured on these points, though he still persists in trying to obtain a definite assurance from the British Government guaran teeing the succession of his own heirs made to the Shaikhdom. The Convention regularises the status of Kuwait and in that respect is a yaluable ftistrument. The Shaikh's relations with the Ottoman Government continue to be friendly, though no doubt his sympathies Witt the Turkish Goveroment. are Bi n g au( l i n his efforts to free himself from Turkish interference in Eastern Nejd. Shaikh Sir Mubarak-us-Subah, seeing that funds were being sent to the Turkish Red Crescent Society from all quarters and feeling that furthur - couragement of subscription from Kuwait might place him in an un es '- position, convened a meeting of the leading merchants on the and opened a subscription list in aid of the wounded and sufferers m Balkan War. He despatched £T.7,000 to Basrah by his for remittance to the Ked Crescent Society in addition to £' • » was said had been previously remitted by a draft. S w 1132 PEKSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Abdul Aziz Bin Salim Badr, formerly Shaikh Mubarak's Secretary and now ao-ent at Basrah, arrived from Basrah in the Shaikh's yacht on the 24th \ pril with Haji Ta'ah Chalabi, Member of the Basrah Chamber of Commerce, and the Turkish Mudir-i-Tapu (Land Registrar) of Basrah. The two latter it appears were at Fao and, on hearing that Shaikh Mubarak was very ill, board ed the vacht there and came to see him; both returned to Basrah five days later. The visit was probably connected with the registration of the Shaikh's properties in the' Tapu Office. The Kaimakam of Fao arrived from Eao by a'ballam'on the 13th April to beg the payment in advance of the land taxes on the Shaikh's date gardens at Eao for the ensuing Arabic year. He returned a few days after, the Shaikh having given him a draft on Basrah to fall due on the first day of the new fiscal year. Eleven Turkish sailors arrived in Kuwait on the 26th May. It appears that in making for the Lightship at the Shatt-el-Arab Bar they were drifted south by wind and tide and, after 5 days at sea, succeeded in landing to the south of Eas-ul-Arz whence they came overland. Ihe Shaikh's relations with Shaikh Khazal continue to be very friendly and intimate. He visited Pailiyah 4 times with the shaikh of Mohammera . during the year remaining as many as 6 and 8 weeks on each occasion. In the 3rd week of January he sent 1,000 bags of rice by native boats to Shaikh Khazal for the use of the latter's force at Nasiri. In the beginning of the year Eeverend Calverley and Dr. Harrison of the American Mission applied to the Shaikh w ith the American Mission. them to visit Anizah or Eiyadh. The Shaikh evaded a direct answer by requesting them to produce a written assurance from the Political Agent that he had no objection to their proposal. They then addressed a joint letter to the Political Agent requesting this assu rance and absolving him from any responsibility should they come to grief in their enterprise. The Political Agent did his best to discourage them from attempting so hazardous an undertaking, warning them that the invitations which they had received from Bedouin medically treated in the Mission Dispensary were no safeguard owing to their want of influence. Finding it difficult to shelve their application, the matter was referred to the Political Eesident and by him to the Government of India. With their authority the head of the Mission at Basrah was informed that it was considered inconsistent with British interests for members of the Mission to visit Central Arabia from the coast of the Gulf and that we were therefore compelled to 'discourage such an enterprise. The matter, however, has not been dropped and may lead to difficulties in the future. Mr. Shaw of Messrs. Shaw and Haynes, Consulting Engineers, Basrah, started work on the new Mission hospital in January but, owing to delay in receiving material and want of labour, the work proceeded very slowly. Mr. P. C. Haynes who was latterly superintending the construction stopped work in the middle of November, since when further funds have been provided and the building is now being pushed forward together with the quarters for the Minister and the Doctor. Dr. Harrison and Reverend and Mrs. Calverley, with occasional visits to other Gulf ports, were in Kuwait almost throughout the year. The former was, however, relieved by Dr. Mylrea in the beginning of December when he proceeded to Bahrain. With the exception of an epidemic of smallpox from the middle of September to the end of December, the health of the town has been very good. The Agency dispensary was open throughout the year and 3,398 patients . -p.. were treated as against 3,261 last year or The Agency D, S pe„ M r y . a ^ of CaSCS Of Q'SO as against 8 95 for 19] 2. One hundred and seventy-two vaccinations were performed in 1913, all being successful excepting 35 who did not report themselves.FOR THE YEAR 1813. 133 When Bushire was plague infected in April passengers arriving at Kuwait Quarantine. quarantined in boats near the Shaikh's „ Customs, the Shaikh having abando™?

The ^^Te^marfed and the Governmeat of India have been asked to make a special grant of money to admit of its being adequately fenced in during 1914. The administration of the Shaikh's Customs rested with Abdul Musin Customs Administration. and Haji Ali Abda until August 1913 when the former, who was in the last stage of consumption, was given leave and one Saliman bin Badr, a local Arab was appointed in his place on a salary of R200 per mensem plus a loan of E10 3 000 for trading purposes Haji Ali Abda was removed on the representa tions of the new incumbent who manned his Department with an entirelv new staff. The new Customs Master seemed unable to realize his responsibilities and was soon in trouble with the British India Steam Navigation Companv's local agents over mislanded and excess cargo, which he appeared to regard as Ms perquisite; in November, however, the Shaikh himself discovered that Suliman bin Badr had been secretly selling all mislanded cargo and appropriat ing the proceeds. He immediately dismissed and imprisoned him for about 5 days, only releasing him on the payment in cash of E3,000 against some RIO,000 claimed for embezzled Customs receipts and E2,000 on account of dates given to him by the Shaikh last year. He is said to have since paid the balance to the Shaikh. Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil, a local Arab, has now been appointed Customs Master, with Mr. William Hickey, a Basrah Christian and formerly clerk and manager of Messrs. Gray Paul and Company at Kuwait as Hamal-Bashi. Unless these two men give way to the many temptations which present themselves in the Customs for enriching themselves, it is hoped that the management of the Customs will be considerably improved. Yusuf Nasrani who was taken as a clerk in the Customs last year was dismissed in April. His dismissal was unexpected and was probably the result of iiltrigues on the part of the other members of the Customs establishment. The Customs premises have been considerably enlarged during the year by the reclamation of more ground and the extension of; covered space. The whole has also been properly fenced and merchandise awaiting clearance is not now exposed to the old risk of loss and damage by thieves and weather. The Shaikh, with a view to making merchants clear their goods sooner and to avoid accumulations, is said to be contemplating the introduction of wharfage dues shortly. He has also, it is reported, ordered from England a 3-ton hand- power crane for landing and shipping heavy packages at the wharves. The following ships of His Majesty's Navy and the Eoyal Indian Marine Naval and Marine. visited K ™ait during the year : H- M. S, Philomel' on the 11th January. H. M. S.

As a result of the establishment of the Arms 'Warehouse in Maskat the Arms Traffic. illicit traffic in arms appears to have died out entirely, so far at least as Kuwait is134 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT concerned, for no further cases of attempts to smuggle arms have been reported during the year under review. In January a complaint was made to Shaikh Mubarak by a Nakhuda of a boat belonging to the Marafi house that she was stopped by a British man-of- war near Charak, though loaded with dates and bound from the Shatt-el-Arab to Oman The case was enquired into and, as the complaint appeared to have been grossly exaggerated, the facts were explained to the Shaikh and the matter dropped. In April the Political Agent heard in the desert that a large proportion of the arms seized at Shargah in September 1912 by the Residency Agent belonged really to Abdul Aziz k&lt; Bin Saud ' and certain news of the fate of the Arabs captured with them only reached Nejd about the end of February 1913. Bin Saud discussed the incident with the Political Agent who submitted his repre sentations on the subject to the Political Resident. In view of the political changes caused by Bin Saud's ejectment of the Turkish troops from the Hasa province it was decided to be inopportune to move in the matter. Head Constable Mir Aslam arrived from Bushire on the 25th July in charge of Mahdu, a notorious Kuwaiti arms smuggler, who had been deported from Maskat by orders of His Highness the Sultan. The prisoner was handed over to the Shaikh who, after subjecting him to a severe flogging, sentenced him to a fine of Bl,500 with 3 months' imprisonment in double irons. Durino* 1913 only one application was received from a local slave for the manumission of his wife, daughter and slave Trade. himself. The case was represented to the 'Ruler of Kuwait who, after enquiry, took the whole family into his own service, the negro to work in the Customs and his wife in the harum. He also undertook that, should the negro at any time desire to leave his service, he would be given his freedom forthwith. Work on the Kuwait pearling fleet was commenced in April but, owing to the large stocks of last season's pearls Pearl Fisheries. gtill lying unrealized in Bombay, money for advances was scarce and these were, this ssason, limited to R70 and E50 to each diver and puller. The whole fleet left for the banks in the first fortnight of May and returned in the first week of August for the Ramzan Id. It again left for the banks in the first week of September and returned in the second week of October. The season was reported to be a poor one in the take of pearls and a bad one for prices and consequently where divers received advances of R700 after last year's season they were lucky to get R200 this year. One result has been that the Nejdi diving fraternity is said to be con templating giving up diving and joining Bin Saud in his raiding expeditions against the tribes as likely to be more profitable. The 4 pirates referred to in last year's report were brought to Kuwait in H. M. S. u Philomel' on the 11th IVacie8 ' January. The murderers were handed over to Shaikh Mubarak for safe custody and the Political Agent held an enquiry in the matter. The crime being proved fhe suggested that sanction might be accorded to their execution by rifle shot. On the receipt of the orders of Government the Shaikh was informed of their acquiescence but, as the murderers were the subjects of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, Shaikh Mubarak decided with his consent to imprison them for life. One of the pirates named Kadhair Bin Marzuq died in prison on the 20th March, and two others later in the year. Another piracy was committed this year by the Somali crew of a Kuwait Towash's ballam ' while she was on her way back to Kuwait from Bahrain^ The Towash and owner of the 'ballam,'' Saif bin Zaid with his cousin^ Yusut bin Husain bin Ali, and a Baghdadi cook were returning to Kuwait after selling his pearls in Bahrain. On the night of the 22nd July when east ot Kasr-as-Subaih one of the four Somalis shot and wounded Saif. His cousin, Yusuf bin Husain bin 'Ali, startled from his sleep, made an effort to grapple with the assailant but, in the scuffle which ensued, he and Saif bin were thrown overboard. The ' ballam ' then altered her course for the PirateFOR THE TEAR 1913. 135 Coast carrying with her E5,500 which the Towash had on board, Yusuf bin Husaia supported his cousm till daylight on the 23rd when they were picked no by a passing pearl-boat and taken to Jubail. Saif bin Zaid died 2 hours iL from the effects of his wounds and exhaustion and Yusuf bin Husain turned to Kuwait on the 28th with news of the crima. His Majesty's ships were warned by telegraph and the Shaikh sent a ' boo n ' to the Pirate Coast to collect all available information about the «ballaai' and the culprits. Iklen wero al^o sent to Lingah and Maskat and one of these recognized the 4 nirates boarding the mail steamer at Lingah as passengers. They were arrested and sent to Kuwait m charge of an employe of the Lingah Vice-Consulate. The Political Agent held an enquiry into the case and handed over the pirates to Shaikh Jabir for safe custody pending instructions from Government as to their disposal. Three of them were eventually shot, on the 1st October, and the fourth man who first confessed and was later instrumental in the recovery of the looted property was granted a free pardon. When the British India Steam Navigation Company introduced a new SM • time-table for their Persian Gulf slow mail steamers at the beginning of the year, a fortnightly call on the outward voyage only was provided for Kuwait but, on representations being made, the Company was induced to provide a weekly service on the outward and a fortnightly call on the inward voyage. The weeks in which these steamers do not connect with the fast mail service the Agency Launch exchanges the mails at Fao, but the Company now pay the cost of coal and stores so expended. This service meets the requirements of the port and has worked satisfactorily throughout the year. Only one of their fast steamers called at Kuwait with mails in September. Very few steamers of the Arab Steamers, Limited, have called at Kuwait during 1913, the majority of them having been engaged in the Hijaz pilgrim traffic. The S. S. 'Naderi '^of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Com pany called with cargo in March. Other British steamers which called at Kuwait in 1913 are the :—S. S. ' Bahristan,' ' Westminster ', ' Bengrove ', ' Merton Hall', 44 Lotus ' and 'Eaithwaite Hall'. The second two with 10,000 and 5 ,500 cases of kerosine oil respectively and the last two with cargo for the ' Merton HalL' , Shaikh Nasir bin Shain-ut-Tuwar arrived from Bahrain on the 6th Eebru- „ . , m „ ary to obtain the Shaikh's permission to oreigners an rave era. settle at Kasr-as-Subaih. As the Shaikh was away at Mohammorah at the time he remained with Shaikh Jabir. He left for Katr by native boat on the 8th March, Shaikh Jabir having told him that nothing could be done for him in the absence of his father. The Shaikhs were warned that Nasir's residence in Kuwait or Kasr-as-Subaih was considered undesirable and he has not again visited Kuwait. No other foreigners called at Kuwait during the year under review. Captain Currie, Marine Superintendent of the Burmah Oil Company, visited Kuwait from Mohammerah on the 9th July in order to select a site for a bulk-oil loading depdt for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He returned on the 10th having found no suitable place in the vicinity Kuwait. Mr. Gilder, travelling agent of Messrs. John Minnett, Limited, Engineers of Bombay, arrived on the 27th November. He interviewed the Shaikh on the 28th but could secure no orders for his firm and left for Basrah on the 11th December. The Political agent left on a tour in the desert on the 8th March to the south of Kuwait; he reached As-Safa Tours and Visits of British Officials. ^ ^ ^ gi .Gara Wells On the 15th. After leaving Ul-Gara wells he marched South-West through the Suman and Dahana districts and onwards to Gaiyiya wells and Majma town which he reached on the 24ith. He spent a day there with Abdullah bin As- kar, the Amir of the place who was most friendly and hospitable, the political Agent having met him before in the desert and also in Kuwait. Majma is a small town of perhaps 5,000 inhabitants with large date gardens around it.13 0 persian guir administeation eepoet Hearing that Bin Saud was within 3 days' march and close to his intended return route the Political Agent decided to diverge to Bm Saud s camp and renew Ins acquaintance. After leaving Majma the Political Agent contmued hw tour south-eastwards and reached Bin Baud's camp at Khafs on the 30th March He remained, halted 3 days in Bin Sand's camp and was treated m the most friendly and hospitable fashion. He found that though Bin Sand and his m- fluential men were anxious to hear the latest news of the Turko-Balkan War, they evinced no sympathy for the Turkish cause. After leaving Bin baud s camp the Political Agent marched east-north-east to the Rnmaihiyah wells and thence north-west to Hafar-ul-Ats wells Colonel Pelly is the only other European who has visited this district, which as far as desert can he was a pleasing expanse of rolling downs covered with green Arafi] bushes m flower and numbers of wild flowering plants. After leaving Hafar-ul-Ats the Political Agent marched northwards again crossing the Dahanah and Suman tracts to Jariya-as-Siyah wells. He had difficulty over water but fortunately found some in a rock fissure after 3 days' march in the Suman—the water though exceedingly bad was acceptable. Prom Janya-as- Siflah he proceeded to Hamth whence he turned north and reached Kuwait on the 21st April. His trip covered a considerable amount _ of unexplored country and should prove useful from a geographical point of view. The Political Agent visited Bushire twice in the Agency Launch ''Lewis Pelly,' in January and October and also His Majesty s Consuls at Moham- merah and Basrah in June and December. He visited Kubbar Island on the 24th February. He accompanied the Resident to Bahrain on the 17 th November and again visited that port on the 6th December with His Excel lency the Naval Commander-in-Chief.

During the year under report, the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf on the whole, may be said to have passed through two distinct phases. The first of these, which lasted until the outbreak of the European War, was brisk and flourishing; and the second, which marked the closing months of the year almost complete collapse. ^ ' Pirst Phase. During this period the Naval blockade was still in force more strictly in the Gulf of Oman than in the Persian Gulf, and, as far as the Mekran Coast is concerned, during the half-year ending 30th June 1914, only 975 rifles and 102,100 rounds of ammunition were landed. It is gratifying to be able to state that, in comparison with the statistics for the corresponding periods for previous years, these figures not only show a remarkable decrease, but are the lowest on record. It must be remembered that reports of landings almost in variably emanate from native informers and that, if they err at all, it is on the side of exaggeration.^ Nearly every consignment of arms which has been successfully landed in MeJ^ran since the beginning of 1914 has consisted partially, and in some cases almost entirely, of obsolete weapons. If therefore, from the already small total of rifles landed, deductions be made on these two counts, the balance immediately shrinks to a negligible quantity, and conse quently, for the first time in the history of the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf, it can be said that the dhow-borne trade in arms to the Mekran Coast is of no real account. The reason for this satisfactory state of affairs is that Maskat has ceased to be a harbour for traders, large and small, owing to the more or less satisfactory working of the Arms Warehouse. Moreover, with the deportation of the notorious Ali Khan-bin-Musa Khan, all the small brokers who were carrying on a secret trade with numerous Baluchis from the Mekran Coast, fled further 'west to the Batineh Coast and endeavoured to form small Dep6ts in that district. During the latter half of *1913, when it transpired that they were being replenished by some means or other, these Dep6ts began to cause some anxiety. ■However, it is now clear that the majority of those along the coast have entirely ceased to exist and that if any still remain in the highlands of Oman hey only contain rusted and unmarketable weapons. B2 PERSIAN GULP ADMINISTRATION REPORT The Afghans coming down into Mekran, of whom there have been larger numbers than has been the case during recent years, had to get rifles brought over from the Arab Coast by advancing money to Baluchis, who knew the Batineh well, and then sending them over to collect them. Prom early in the year, however, Nakhudas only agreed to carry arms under the understanding that, if their dhows were held up by a Naval ship, every rifle on board would be promptly jettisoned. The result was that the Baluchis always came back with the same story that they had met a man-of-war (which was very often true) and had been obliged to throw all the rifles overboard. The Afghans, tired of their losses, had to abandon this plan, and a certain number set out to visit Maskat and exploit the Arms Warehouse there. They travelled by a very roundabout route and arrived there safely, but before they had had time to do any business, they were captured, relieved of all their money and deported. The adventures of these Afghans clearly show how difficult it has become to obtain even the smallest number of rifles of the right sort from the Batineh Coast, The north of the Gulf now became more and more evident as the scene of operations, or rather the centre of distribution, notably Kuwait and Zubair. The question now arises, what was the source of supply to these centres ? It has been remarked that the Maskat Arms Warehouse was working 'more or less satisfactorily.' This has been said advisedly, as large consign ments of arms and ammunition were allotted by the Sultan of Maskat to various Shaikhs and Chiefs, principally on the Trucial Coast of Oman, also large consignments were drawn from the Warehouse by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah. None of these allotments appear in the Warehouse returns. As a result of certain investigations into the Arms Traffic at Kuwait, it was reported that certain leading men of the district were engaged actively in the trade They made it their business to find out what kind of arms and am munition were most marketable locally, and they then ordered them from Maskat. Generally speaking. Arms Traffic in Kuwait was impossible except through Shaikh Sir Mubarak, who formerly, there is reason to believe, winked at one or two irregularities. Arms were sent from Kuwait to Zubair and Basrah, whence a few went to Baghdad and others to Mohammerah. Persian gun-runners, who used to import arms from Maskat into Persian ports, now made Kuwait the emporium for their trade. They were^ reported to be in the habit of bringing arms to Bud Hilleh, the most convenient port, and thence distributing them to outlying parts. Apart from this leakage from the Warehouse in Maskat, there is a suspicion that Jibuti had, to a very small extent, taken the place of Maskat as a distn- butino* centre. No confirmation was received of a report to the efiect tiiat Jibuti dhows occasionally found their way up the Gulf, except perhaps in a report received from Maskat that a dhow flying the Prench flag was suspected of having landed arms on the Mekran Coast near Charbar. Information was received, however, from two independent sources that arms were being sent rrom Jibuti to Yanbo and other Hedjaz ports, whence they were sent to Al-Madman Prom there they were taken northwards by the Hedjaz Bailway to some point which could not be ascertained and thence across the desert to Kuwait an^ Zubair. In this connection it may be noted that 20 cases of rifles ana am munition are said to have been despatched from Al-Madmah for Ajaymi, Shaikh of the Muntafik Arabs. Whilst the consignment was en route it was captured by Ibn Eashid's men, but was subsequently allowed to proceed owing to an understanding having been arrived at between Ibn BaShid and Ajaymi. It was further stated that 13 M. H. rifles were imported into Zubair from Al-Madinah by one Bin Gadaan of Majm'ah. This evidence would seem to point to the fact that unprecedented ® were being made by those interested to import arms and ammunition into me Persian Gulf regardless of cost. The Prench traders in Maskat had been compensated by the Indmn gov ernment and had left the Gulf. Practically all the native dealers o y standing had thrown up the business, Still there remained, evidence g and increasing activity in Arms Traffic, in the north of the Gulf especia -y activity was undoubtedly due to German influence and interest.poe the yeafi 1914. ^ It had been known for some time that German ships plyino in th P fi„lf smuggled arms and ammumtion into Basrah concealed amongst materials for the construction of the Baghdad Railway. It was suspected also that lar^e consio-n men ts were transhipped from these vessels into dhows in unfrequented parts of the Gulf. On the surface these appear to be merely commercial enterprises without any particular significance, but when the case of the Germ^ S mmedia arose quite a new construction maybe placed on these transactions In view of what follows it may be well to state here the details connected witil tfl6 CclSG. The following telegram was received from the Admiralty, dated 6th April 1914 :— ' ^ Begins—' Information received that German ship Nicomedia leff Antwerp on ,31st March probable destination Balrah wTth S cases 'Granite' marked:— K.S P .O. 6892,1-22 and S.K.O. 168-182 Consigned Bushire by firm Walford and Co. First lots are known to contain rifles and probably second lots consist of car- tndges.'— Ends. The Nicomedia arrived at T^ushire, on May 10th, at noon, and she remained till after sunset on the 11th. On the 13th, the Provisional Director of Customs at Bushire, whom the Resident had taken into his confidence, reported that these cases had not been landed at Bushire. It was further ascertained that they did not appear on the Bushire manifest. The fact that Herr Wassmuss the German Consul at Bushire, left Bushire in the Nicomedia and proceeded to Basrah, is regarded with extreme suspicion. Indeed it would almost seem to point to the fact that German Government officials not only had knowledge of but actually aided this traffic in arms. In connection with this it may he noted that reliable information was received to the effect that the Germans were importing rifles into Baghdad, making use of the railwav as far as possible in doing so, and further, that these rifles were being sent to the Lur Chiefs to help them to resist the advance of the British railway survey party in Luristan. Information was received also from a reliable source that the Germans were concerning themselves in the trans-Arabian Arms Traffic. Arms were brought out in German steamers, presumably belonging to the Hamburg-Amerika Line^ and landed at the port of Yanbo, situated on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea rather south of Al-Madinah in latitude. I rom this evidence it seems that the German venture was not only confined to commerce but that it had a political significance, the extent of which, if it had continued, it is impossible to gauge. And so the first phase closes with the Arms Traffic in a more or less flouri shing condition in the northern part of the Gulf, while in the south and on the Mekran Coast it has become an almost negligible quantity for the first time in its history. Second Phase. As has been enunciated at the beginning of this report, this phase is one of almost complete collapse. During this period there has been no Naval blockade and no Arms Traffic preventive measures whatever have been taken. The coast was clear, the seas were open to all and sundry who might desire to cross them with their boats jaden with arms and ammunition without fear of capture or even hindrance, the same system of intelligence, however, has been maintained and all landings have been reported as usual. These have been few but with one or two com paratively large ones, which there is reason to believe have been exaggerated, fciost of these arms have been brought from Katr, and by Afghans who had made the journey thither to procure them.4 persian gtulf administeation eepoet Although the trade in munitions had decreased on the outbreak of the European War to an almost negligible quantity in Mekran, there was still considerable activity in the northern arena. This activity, however, practically ceased with the cessation of Grerman shipping. The logical conclusion, therefore, is that the Arms Traffic in the northern part of the Gulf has, to a large extent, been recently kept alive by the Germans. Whether their motives were purely commercial or ulterior we may never know, evidence points to the latter. Since the arrival of the Indian Expeditionary Force at Bahrain and the capture of Basra, by the British, the Arms Traffic in the northern part of the Gulf has also assumed a practically negligible quantity. There is reason to suppose that there is a certain quantity of munitions remaining in Katr, which in ail probability will be absorbed by the Arab tribes in the vicinity. Still a few may find their way over to the Mekran Coast. The stocks of arms on the Batineh Coast are finished and the only likely prospects of replenishment in the future are in the event of peace being declared with the Imam in Oman, when undoubtedly his followers and those of the Sultan of Maskat will be only too ready to dispose of their arms to the first buyer. The same applies to the armed tribes in the northern part of the Gulf and on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, unless effective measures are taken to control the disposition of arms. E, C.

Captain L. Birdwood held the office of Eirst Assistant to the Eesident until his departure on leave, on the 6th June 1914, when he was relieved by Captain W. G. Neale, who held charge of this post until the close of the year. Lieutenant P. G. Loch remained as Second Assistant to the Eesident until the 25th June, wten he was relieved by Captain E. W. C. Noel, who held charge until the end of the year. Lieutenant P. G. Loch was also posted temporarily as Eirst Assistant to the Political Eesident from the 9th Eebruary to the 7th March. Major S. Hunt, I.M S., performed the duties of Eesidency Surgeon and Chief Quarantine Officer in the Persian Gulf until the 20th October, when he was relieved by Major J. M. McPherson, I.M S. The post of Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Officer remained vacant throughout the year. Mr. Vice-Consul H. C. Chick held charge of the Vice-Consulate until the 11th May, when he made over charge to Mr. C. J. Edmonds, Consular Assis tant. The last named officer retained charge of the Vice-Consulate until Mr. H. G. Chick again returned to duty on the 13th December 1914 and Mr. C. J. Edmonds reverted to the post of Consular 1 Assistant, which he held until the close of the year. The post of His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz was filled by Major W. E. T. O'Connor, C.I.E., throughout the year. Monsieur Loiko held charge of the Eussian Consulate-General throughout Toreign Interests. year. Herr Wassmuss, German Consul, held charge until the 8th July, when Doctor H. Listemann returned from leave and assumed charge, which he held until the end of the year. Mr. E. H. C. Gibbs, Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, was in charge of the Norwegian Vice-Consulate until the 28th Eeb ruary, when he was relieved by Mr. W. E. Man son, also of the Imperial Bank, who held charge until the end of the year. Nedjed Eejeb remained in charge of the Turkish Consulate until the 3rd July, when he committed suicide. After his death, the affairs of the Consulate were entrusted to Moollah Husain, a local Persian, who has been Turkish Con sular Dragoman for many years. No Consul de carriere has yet been sent to replace Nedjed Eejeb. His Majesty's Consul-General held charge of the Erench Vice-Consulate umil the 16th September, when, after a period of about 2J years, during which Erench interests had been in the charge of this Consulate-General, Monsieur Vadala arrived, assumed and remained in charge until the end of the year. Owing to the! departure, in the end of July, of Major Marzin, the Erench mili tary doctor, who was in medical charge of the Eussian and Erench Consulates and of the Imperial Persian Customs Department and, owing to the fact that6 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT no substitute was sent by Prance to replace him, the charge of all these various medical interests devolved on the Eesidency Surgeon, who continued to dis charge these rather difficult and delicate duties to the satisfaction of his many employers and until the end of the year. The Customs were particularly appreciative. Major S. G. Knox, I.A., C.I.E., as acting British Consul-General, on the 8th March, assumed charge of Dutch interests from Captain L. Birdwood, and remained in charge for the rest of the year. On the 2nd July, Dr. Marobbio, Doctor of Oommerial Sciences, arrived in Bushire to represent Italian interests. He remained only a short time and left for Tehran via Mohammerah and Ahwaz, handing over charge of the Con sulate he had founded to Captain W. Gr, Neale, who held charge until the end of the year. Mirza Ali Muhammad Khan, the Muwaqqar-ed-Dowleh, continued to hold charge of the office of Governor of the Gulf Ports throughout the year. His attitude towards British interests has been somewhat supine of late. During the War, he has, on the whole, preserved the neutrality towards belligerents enjoined on him by the Central Government at Tehran. In his demeanour, however, signs of pro-German sympathies have not been lacking. They are probably induced by Persian public feeling around him, actively anti- Bussian, suspicious of Great Britain and therefore pro-German. The Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh has remain- Governor-General of Fars. ec [ j throughout the year, at his post at Sbiraz. • Mirza Ahmad Khan, Masud-es-Sultaneh, continued to hold the post of Foreign Office Agent at Bushire, through out the year. This last year he has been unjustifiably slack in dealing with British cases, more probably however from excessive opium smoking and indolence than any anti-British bias. Abdur Eiza Khan, mentioned last year, has held the post continuously xr, i. j jt- «.. , and attracted no particular notice. Kalantar and Kadkhnda. * r Monsieur H. Bourgeois took over charge from Monsieur Zwinne on the Ciigtoms 29th March 1914. Monsieur Bourgeois has, especially since the War broke out, shown a steady desire to work in with the British. He appears to be a capable and conscientious official with a sincere desire to do his best for the interests he is in charge of, and this Eesidency has no reason to complain of him. Some figures showing the effect of the War on the port of Bushire have been obtained through the courtesy of the Provincial Director and are quoted as of some interest.

It is believed that the advance will be maintained as it is understood to be due to congestion on the Russian railways and disturbances m Azarbaijan, which are closing the Russian Trade Boutes, and British trade from the Persian Gulf Ports has a chance nf winning back some lost ground. ctnLtJ 01 In last year's report it was mentioned that the wing of the 102nd Grena- Indian Troops at Bushire. diers was under strength and barely suffi- , , , -p.

This wmg was further depleted to send reinforcements to Maskat m the beginning of November, and its strength now stands at 4 British officers and 200 men. 5 Towards the end of the year, slight and rather unexpected indications from His Excellency the Governor appeared to imply that, to His Excellenov at any rate, the presence of the force is unwelcome. ^ In February, the attitude of hostility adopted by His Excellency the General situation and events in Fars. Governor-General towards all Europeans 01 . , .v „ - , . ,, f the of the Persian Qovernment at Shiraz began to be reflected m the town and shots were fired one nio&gt;ht at Colonel Merrill's personal servant. It was established that they were intended for Monsieur Stas, the Belgian Finance Agent. The Governor-General refused to take action or make any display of energy in endeavouring to effect the arrest of the culprits and the Colonel of the Gendarmerie, at the request of Monsieur Stas and with the knowledge of His Majesty's Consul, deported a notorious Shiraz intriguer, named Nasir-ul- Mulk, to Bushire, whence he went on to Kerbala. Early in the year, Shiraz reports indicated that the situation at Kazeruu Kazemn episode and death of Major ohison. was unsatisfactory. Hobberies were fre- quent and, on the 6th February, the Finance Agent was attacked by the men of Ali Muhammad, Kamariii; two of his party were killed and three wounded. On the 26th February, in the course of an attack on the house and tower of Nasir-i-Diwan, the late Kadkhuda of Kazerun, who had adopted a menacing attitude. Major Ohison, the Commander of the Gendarmes, was unfortunately shot dead while he was endeavouring to lay a mine to blow up the tower. His party wavered and withdrew to their barracks and the Gendarmes were sur rounded and besieged. With rare courage, Madame Ohison saved the situation and took com-, mand until the arrival of Major Eimbaud, a Frenchman in the employ of Colonel Merrill, who forced his way into the beleagured garrison and did much to restore the courage of the men. In recognition of his bravery and initiative, ne received from his Government a well merited Cross of the Legion of Honour. Reinforcements under Swedish officers were hurried up from Shiraz and shire and, on the 2nd March, Colonel Merrill started from Shiraz with a relieving force. On the 5th March the town was re-occupied and Nasir-i- ijiwan, with all the tufangchis, fled to the hills. Colonel Merrill acted as Military Governor and did what he could to restore and maintain order. For some days this was little enough, as he received no support from the Swedish olncers, while his- own force was too weak to restrain the Gendarmes bent on revenge and especially plunder. The town, including the bazaar, was entirely ooted by them. Some 30 or 40 prisoners, including the principal merchant, narrowly escaped death on the flimsiest charges owing to Colonel Merrill's exer- lo ns. It was some months before tranquillity was re-established, but eventually ^ early June, the author of the troubles, Nasir-i-Diwan, came to terms with ajor Uggla, Commandant of the Fars Gendarmerie, and entered their service! The Kazerun episode shook even the faith of His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, Finance of the Fars Gendarmerie. 1x1 the eventual SUCCCSS of the Gendar- merie and possibly led to a close examm- £i r onn C0S ^ ^ : fr )roe &gt; ^ or » March, he pointed out that it was about 0 J ^ J e arly, more than the entire revenues of the province.8 PERSIAN GULP ADMINISTRATION REPORT In May lie pointed out that large sums incurred by the Gendarmerie were owing to British firms, whom we had encouraged to supply them with goods. In June, an additional advance of £50,000 was made by the Home and Indian Governments for the upkeep of the Gendarmerie, of which £40,000 were reserved for Pars. At the beginning of November the money had vanished with the excep tion of a smalfbalance required to meet the claims of British firms for goods supplied. Exactly how the force continues to subsist is not clear. The beginning of the year saw the Kawam completely rout the forces of Saiyid Abdul Husain of Lar and enter Kawam and Sowlet. i n co-operation with his son, he succeeded in re-^sserting his influence over the Khamseh tribes and in restoring some semblance of order over the whole oE Eastern Ears and Laristan. In May, His Majesty's Consul reported that the Sowlet had been recon ciled with his brother, and had maintained better order recently among the Kashgais than had been seen for many years. The Kawam and Sowlet were more or less reconciled and, in view of their rehabilitation in the eyes of the Ears public and the consequent change in the political situation, His Majesty's Government gave them both assurances to the effect that they would be prepared, through their representatives and good offices with the Persian Government, to afford them moral support to main tain them as heads of their respective tribes on the following conditions : (i) that they keep the peace towards each other ; (u) that they maintain order among the tribes for which they are respectively responsible ; (Hi) that they should preserve satisfactory relations with British repre sentatives and pay due regard to British interest. (iv) that they should pay their lawful revenues to the Einance office at Ears and should support the various Government Departments. In July, the arsenal, with the valuable munitions it contained, was des troyed by an explosion, due to careless- Destraction of the Arserial. ^ rpj^ was some loss of Hfe and limb and many of the surrounding buildings were seriously damaged. In last year's report, we examined at some length the plans for the formation of a force for the Governor- Colonel Merrill 's Force. General of Ears. Last June, His Excel- lencv countermanded all that Colonel Merrill had accomplished. By July, the whole scheme had broken down and the so-called Army 'had relapsed into its former condition of inefficiency. This notorious outlaw, chief culprit in the attack on Consul Smart and to the force during the Kazerun episode, lost his life towards the end of October in Death of All Muhammad, Kamariji. a local fight near Kazerun.

The Muwaqqar-ed-Dowleh has effected some notable reforms within the town itself, principally in road-making, cleansing of the town and repairing the sea front. To continue the good work, he was anxious to tax foreigneis for municipal purposes. The Residency was glad to do what was possible to assist and, as a result of voluminous correspondence, Sir E. Grev authorised His Majesty's Minister at Tehran not to instruct but advise British pay tlie P ro P ose(iDew municipal taxes at Bushire, on the condition Uiat the Governor was informed at the same time that the right to obiect to tae payment of such taxes is reserved if at any time under the present b-overnor or his successors it appeared that British subjects are getting no beneht from the levy, or that the funds collected are being squandered or not devoted to the objects specified. Sir E. Grey further stipulated that it be made quite clear that tue payment of any taxes, which cannot be claimed as due under the 1903 Convention, is for specific purposes of public utility, whereby British subjects benefit equally with others and does not involve any breach in the validity of that instrument. A further condition laid down was that other Foreign subjects also paid these taxes, while His Majesty's Minister reserved to His Majesty's Govern ment the right to consider the whole question at the end of this year . Probably as a result of the limitations thus imposed, the Provincial Controller of Einance, on the 1st August, informed the Resident that he had deterred the question of the payment by foreign nationals of the new municipal taxes until further ordeis were received by him on the subject. At the end of 1913, a portion of Colonel Merrill's local force was Dashti and Dashtistan, despatched to Bushire to assist the Gov- t ernor in collecting the revenues of these districts. His Excellency never believed in these men, who, he said, were10 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT recruited from the dregs of the Shiraz populace. He desired that Captain Lundber' of the Swedish Gendarmerie should discipline and perhaps lead them on their expedition, but this proposal, though constantly revived by His Excellency, failed to meet with the approval of the Central Authorities. The foice met with scant success, desertions were numerous and the Chiefs but moderately impressed. In spite of the considerable expense involved, only Tomans 13 000 were collected out of Tomans 35,000, but of late some revenue has been collected by Abdur Easul, ex-Kalantar of Bushire, who figures promi nently in the report for the year 1912. The districts have not yet been officially transferred to the Government of the Gulf Ports. The leading Bakhtiari Khans continued to cast covetous eyes on Lirawi throughout 1914, and their intrigues were Baiihtiari aggression on Lirawi. a 00ns t an t source of alarm to the Lirawi Khans, and of trouble to His Majesty's Minister and the Residency. In January, the Khans of Lirawi petitioned the Central Government to secure them from aggression by transferring the district to the Government of the Gulf Ports. The Prime Minister in reply gave them assurances and stated that previous orders for non-interference had been repeated to Sirdar-i-Jang, Bakhtiari : but despite the fact that Sir W. Townley telegraphed m January, June, September and November 1914, that he was pressing the Persian Gov- ernment strongly for the transfer, no result had been obtained by the end of the year. In February, the owner of the Fief, Hap Said-us-Sultaneh mortgaged the farm of Lirawi to the Bank against an advance of 20 ' 000 t 5' man ® repayable by half-yearly instalments of 2,500 tomans. The Khans have since remitted punctually to the Bank at Bushire, instead of to the owner two instalments of rent inclusive of the State tax payable to the Treasury in Tehian by the owner of the Fief. But in May, regardless of the revenue having been paid at Tehran, the Belgian Treasury Agent at Bushire ordered the Khans to pay revenue to him, and at the same time it appeared that M. Mornard, the Treasurer-General, had been secretly arranging with the Bakhtiari Governor of Behbehan, Sirdar Muazzim, for the latter to levy the Malty at from the district and remit it to Bushire. In August, it was reported that the Bakhtiari Khans at were aerain pressing the owner to sell Lirawi, and, m September, Sir W. y learnt from Haji Said-us-Sultaneh that he was being offered increased rent by the Bakhtiaris : in consequence His Majesty's Minister found it necessary to warn Amir Mufakham, Bakhtiari, to keep their hands off Lirawi.

J the Governor had no sufficient and reliable force to ensure the co these revenues. Those of the Gulf Ports (Customs revenues always excepted) leave margin for safeguarding the caravan route.FOR THE YEAR 1914. ^ The problem seems likely to be settle itself, as, eeonomical COll- ciderations compel the withdrawal of the Gendarmerie and, if thesuWdiV* f. the Khans are left unpaid, there is little doubt that the levy or Eahdari will recommence. In 1911, Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, the Khan of Borasjun, arrested two of Interference of Gendarmerie in Tribal Affairs. Tr S 'l i } ea(lmen ^ ^6 Borasjun m u . V1 ^b e 0 f Kulul, on a charge of plotting against him. These men have ever since been kept in chains by him in snite of the recommendations and remonstrances of Ismail Khan, Khan of ShahbVm kareh, to whom they are also related. As a result of this action of the Ghazan- far, his wife, a daughter of Ismail Khan, left her husband and with her voiim, son returned to her father. ^ u o Negotiations for reconciliation and exchange had several times been carried on ineffectually, when suddenly, at the end of June 1914, the Governor-General of Pars, who had entrusted the conduct of affairs of Dashti and Dashtistan of which Shahbankareh and Borasjun form part, to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, issued orders to Ismail Khan through the Gendarmerie officers for the immediate surrender of his daughter and grandson to Ghazanfar. These were followed by the appearance of Gendarmerie officers, acting on orders from their Swedish Commandant, and then a force of 100 Gendarmes at Sa'dabad Ismail Khan's chief village, with orders to coerce him. The Khan was power less and evacuated the village, leaving his daughter to be carried off by the Gendarmes to Borasjun. The Khan complained bitterly of the action to Mr. Edmonds, Acting British Vice-Consul, when on tour shortly after, and, in view of the friendly attitude of the Shahbankareh Khans to the Eesidency and this injudicious interference and partizanship in tribal quarrels by a force which has repeatedly been told to confine itself strictly to policing the road, the Resident considered it necessary to make strong protests to Shiraz and' Tehran. At Shiraz, ^ however, far from excusing himself, Colonel Uggla, by stipulating for conditions involving a surrender of territory by Ismail Khan, made the only suitable reparation, the release of Ismail Khan's relations impri soned by the Ghazanfar impossible.

The attendance of patients continues to be satistac- tory.

It is noteworthy that a considerable proportion of our patients are women and they show less objection than women of the same class in India to undergo treatment at the hands of the male doctors. The building which serves for a hospital is the property of a Persian who has for lor g expended no money on its upkeep. Consequently the building is in the last stages of disrepair and its condition is such as to render it a most unsatisfactory place in which to carry on medical and surgical work, it is greatly to be desired that the British Medical Staff in Bushire may soon be housed more worthily. A small fund, accumulated by contributions of some of the chief in habitants of Bushire, has for some time been destined by them to go towards the provision of a good hospital, and until recently it appeared as it tn intention was that the new hospital should be run by Persians. A counter proposal with some considerable authority to back it is to the effect that tun be raised locally to assist in the building of a new hospital on a site to be gran - ed free by its proprietor. The hope has been expressed that the ^oyernmen of India would be good enough to permit the Staff of the Eesidency D ^pensa y to run the new Hospital intended to replace it, and that further the ^ over ment of India might possibly assist in the expense of building the hospita . There is little doubt that it will be a considerable time before the oca efforts, if unaided, will suffice to build and maintain a good hospital.for the year i9i4. 13 The Quarantine System in the Persian Gulf has worked smoothlv dnrine Qaarantine. the year.

Mirza Abul Kasim Khan and proceeded to take up his seat in the &lt;&lt; Ma3lis ,, as Member for Bandar Abbas. Mirza- Abul Kasim Khan held charge till the end of the year. He was up to quite recently but a clerk in the personal service of His Excellency the Muwaqqar- ed-Dowleh. He is decidedly lacking in experience and tact. He at first did not display much anxiety to cultivate friendly relations with the Vice-Consulate; but a marked change was noticeable after he received a warning from his Chief at Bushire to work in agreement with the Vice-Consulate. The Deputy Governor performed the duties of Karguzar during the year. Salim Khaja represented the Turkish Government up to the 13th May, when he proceeded to Constantinople after Foreign Representatives. nominating his uncle Muhammad Khaja as his successor. The Deputy Governor recognised neither of them as Turkish Representative. Muhammad Khaja was very active, after War was declared on Turkey, in spreading false news reports about the progress of the War. Muhammad Tahnun continued to act as Agent for His Highness the Sultan of Maskat during the year. Monsieur Willemsens held charge as Director of Customs during the year. Customg During the first half of the year he never lost an opportunity of causing the Vice- Consulate trouble. Numerous complaints were preferred against him to the Political Eesident at Bushire by the Vice-Consul and he was summoned to Bushire by the Provincial Director of Customs to answer them. After his return from Bushire he displayed a better feeling towards the Vice-Consulate and a desire to work amicably. In retaliation for the confiscation of two boats by the Customs Department the Shaikh of the Island of Qais, no doubt with the knowledge of his Chief, the Shaikh of Charak, ill-treated and imprisoned a Customs Official. The Vice- C(&gt;nsul, on being appealed to by M. Willemsens, effected the release of the official. No steps have yet been taken to punish the offenders. Smuggling is still rife in the Lingah District and on the Shib Kuh Coast and to minimise it M. Willemsens has recommended the introduction of a uniform tariff of 5 per cent, on all goods. The Revenue of the Lingah Town and Eevenue. District was collected by the Customs Administration without any difficulty. A scheme for the re-assessment of the Revenue has been prepared and submitted by Monsieur Willemsens to Tehran for sanction by the &lt;c Majlis.' Condition of th, oonntry. The country has been on the whole very peaceful. The province of Lar was quiet during the greater part of the year after tne Kawam-ul-Mulk succeeded in breaking the power of Saiyid Abdul Husain and punishing the Baharlu tribe.POU TSE YEAR 1914 15 Ifo serious inter-tribal quarrels on the Shib Kuh Coast were reported Shaikh Mazkur of Gabandi continued to defy the Persian Government by not payin 0, his revenue, which is now three years in arrears.

In April, it was reported that the post had been robbed just outside Lar. A few instances of gun-running were reported on the Shib Kuh Coast Arms Traffic. during the year. The total number of arms amounted to 56 rifles and 15 revolvers; 10,000 rounds of ammunition were also landed. The firm of Messrs. Eobert Wonckhaus and Company were suspected of being engaged in the Arms Traffic; but it was impossible to prove it owing, firstly, to the great friendship which existed between the local manager of the firm and Monsieur Willemsens, the Customs Director; and secondly, to the facilities accorded to the Pirm of landing their cargo at their own wharf instead of at the Customs House. Under these circumstances it was the easiest thing imaginable for the firm to import rifles packed in Vermicelli cases, and ammunition in packages resembling bundles of gold thread and to declare them as such. The arms could then have been transhipped to the Shib Kuh Ports or sent into the interior. Nine slaves took refuge in the Vice-Consulate, of whom three were slave Traffic. manumitted. The remainder were re turned to their owners after their grie vances were redressed. One slave absconded before his case was settled. Trade was normal up to the outbreak of the War, when imports and Briti 8 h interestB. exports practically ceased owing prin- cipally to scarcity of money due to the dislocation of the pearl market, and secondly, to the absence of shipping. Towards the end of the year, however, a limited quantity of goods were imported from India. The British India Steam Navigation Company continued their slow Mail Service up to the outbreak of the War when, owing to many of their vessels being requisitioned by Government as transports, the Service became extremely irregular. The other Steamship Companies which called at Lingah were the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Arab Company; Strick Line, Bucknalls, Bombay Persia and Persia Arabia Steam Navigation Company.

The latter being a reservist was summoned to join the colours and left Lingah by country boat for Basrah in September, whence he escaped disguised as an Arab at the time the British Expeditionary Eorce were moving on Basrah. He returned to Lingah in December. After the outbreak of War the Eirm confined its labours to recovering their outstandings and to spreading false war news and intriguing. The Hamburg-Amerika Line paid 7 calls on the outward journey (from Hamburg) and brought 15,481 packages. They paid only one call on the homeward journey. The Russian Steam Navigation Company paid 2 calls each on their ooit- ward and homeward journey. They brought and took away very few The Prench cruiser ' Jeanne D'Arc ' visited Lingah in January. Towards the end of 1913 the British India sailing vessel 'Batal Zaver Prasad ' of Cutch was stranded near Busati Piracj - on the Shib Kuh Coast. The crew were ill-treated and robbed of all their possessions by the local people, who also made away with the whole of the cargo of dates and broke up the vessel, ine16 PERSIAN GTTLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT value of the dhow and cargo amounted to Es. 21,799. The Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf demanded the sum of Rs. 25,000 from the Governor of the Gulf Ports as compensation, and the latter deputed the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas to negotiate with Shaikh Mazkur of Gabandi, m whose jurisdic tion the outrage took place, for the settlement of our claim. The negotiation as the result proved, was doomed to failure, as Shaikh Mazkur who had alreadv flouted the Persian Government by not paying his revenue for several years, was not likely to disgorge except by coercion. The case was still pending at the end of the year. The prosperity of the Lingah District, as of the greater part of the Shib r r Kuh Coast, is chiefly dependent on the The war. its effect on trade. pearl trade. This trade was practically killed at the outbreak of the War with the result that money become extreme- lv scarce and orders could not be placed for goods. There seems a very poor prospect of a complete revival of trade for years to come. That no bankruptcies were recorded since the outbreak of War is due, no doubt, to the conservative nature of the people, who do not yet seem to realise the magnitude of the struggle and the vast expenditure of wealth, which must keep the whole world from investing in such luxuries as pearls for manv years after the conclusion of the War. As soon, however, as the position is fully realised, pearl dealers will be called upon to repay the advances made to them and the result will be many failures. Before the entry of Turkey into the arena of the War, public feeling was more or less indifferent as to the result.

Miiza Ali Karam Khan, Shuja-i-^'izam, was Deputy-Governor of Bandar Local Government. - Abbas throughout the year, and has held # the post now for nearly three years, a continuity ot tenure which is a welcome change from the former constant changes. He has continued to work most satisfactorily for British interests and to maintain most friendly relations with Captain Biscoe ; no friction of any kind has existed during the year. 1 here has been no Karguzar at Bandar Abbas during the year and all business between the Consulate and the local authorities is transacted direct with the Deputy-Governor. Karbalai Muhammad Hassan held the appointment of Kalantar of Minab from April to the end of October, when he proceeded to Bushire. An inter regnum ensued, but at the close of the year, news was received that Karbalai Muhammad Hassan had been re-appointed. Monsieur Fourman has held the post of Director of Customs and Pinance Customs. Agent throughout the year, and as a result . . no difficulties of any kind have occurred. He has invariably shown himself conciliatory and broad-minded. He has bad occasional^ differences with the Deputy-Governor on matters of Pinance as was almost inevitable, but on the whole, both sides have shown forbearance and matters have never become acute. At the end of the year he was about to relinquish the post and proceed to Europe to join the Belgian Army. For the first time for many years, the district of Bandar Abbas has Condition of the Country. throughout a whole calendar year enjoyed complete immunity from pillage and disorder. Petty incidents have occurred from time to time, a few head of cattle or a few stray donkeys being driven off ; but the robbers have never been numerous and the incursions en masse by Baharlus and other tribesmen w hich have formed such regular items of past years * reports appear to have ceased. The last raid w r as in March 1913, since when nearly 2 years have elapsed. The situation in the province of Kerman does not appear to have been quite so satisfactory, but on the whole the security of the Trade Eoutes was not seriously interfered with, and no robberies of merchandise were reported at Bandar Abbas. One Hindu travelling down from Kerman to Bandar Abbas had his personal effects carried off by some Baluchis, but with this exception, all British travellers between the two places, of w 7 hom tlwre w ere a considerable number,, reached their destination without incident. As might be expected, the villagers in the district are still in a somewhat ' jumpy ' condition, and when His Majesty's Consul proceeded on tour, the arrival of his party, consisting of himself and some half a dozen sow T ars, was in some places the signal for18 PERSIAN GULP ADMINISTRATION REPORT the male portion of the population to man the local fort or flee to the hills. On the whole, however, the continuance of the normal state of affairs ia undoubtedly having a calming and reassuring effect on the inhabitants. The winter rains had completely failed up to the end of the year ; an early rainfall in October gave promise of a good harvest but no further rain fell, and the outlook for the poorer classes was a black one, as the failure of the rains tended to raise still further the prices of goods, which were already abnormal on account of the TV ar. Parlies of Gendarmerie under Swedish officers visited Bandar Abbas from Kerman in April, June and October. It was originally proposed that they should establish posts along the Bandar Abbas-Kerman Trade Route, and that the two places should be linked up by a telegraph line during the autumn,, hut the project did not mature, chiefly on account of the War. The o-reater security of the Trade Routes found an immediate reflex in the trade returns, those for the Persian year Tiaie - ending on the 20th March 1914 k showing an increase of 31 per cent, in imports over those of the preceding year. returns for the first quarter of the Persian year 1914-15 again showed a steady increase over those of the corresponding period of the y ea J before ; the outbreak of the European War, however, at once paralysed trade: no shipments were received from Europe, and but few from I n dia as the mail service was at once reduced and freights rose. Some merchants who held stocks at the outbreak of War realised handsome profits as the prices of almost all the ordinary articles of commerce went up Once the existing stocks were exhausted, business came almost entirely to a standstill; but very small quantities of goods were received by sea or from the interior. The Persian merchants expressed consternation at the cessation of trade, and with their small financial backing and extensive credit system it was obvious that many of them would be hard hit. The Hindus on the other hand faced the situation with equanimity, and, while admitting that business was slack, appeared to have no anxiety about the future. The general attitude of the populace towards the combatants in the War was mainly coloured by Russophobia. The ^ T&amp;r ' They displayed no hostility at the com mencement of the War to Great Britain, but pro-German reports, emanating chiefly from Basrah, coloured all their views, and their entire ignorance ot even the rudiments of geography obtained credence for the most absurd rumours. To counteract these, Captain Biscoe, from time to time, gave lectures on the War to the British Indian community, who displayed consider able interest and subscribed liberally to the Indian Relief Eund, and summaries of Renter's telegrams were circulated in Persian and English. The entry ot Turkey into the arena, however, naturally aroused the sympathies of the Muhammadan population, but even then it took ^ the form rather of lending a ready ear to tales of Turkish successes than of a display of hostility to Great Britain. The capture of Basrah came as a great blow, and for a long time afterwards tales of its reoccupation by the Turks were daily spread abroad and eagerly believed. The Hamburg-Amerika line paid 8 calls here, the last being in July, and brought 18,720 packages. The vessels Foreign interests. the Steam Navigation Company called 5 times.

Tehran in March and, after a con- siderable halt in Ispahan, arrived in Kerman on the 27th April. The Sirdar-i-Nusrat acted for him till the middle of March, when the Saham-us-Sultaneh arrived with 120 Bakhtiari sowars as Deputy-Governor. Even before his arrival in Kerman. the Governor-General found himself at loggerheads with the Eevenue Department and Mr. Lecoffre. The latter had handed over the Governor-Generars quarters in the Bagh-i- Nasiri to the Gendarmerie and was trying to keep on Mirza Ibrahim Khan as Amin-i-Maliyah though the Sirdar-i-Muhtasham had procured his dismissal in Tehran before he left. The Sirdar-i-Muhtasham insisted on the restoration of the Bagh-i-Nasiri and the dismissal of Mirza Ibrahim Khan before his arrival in Kerman and he carried his point in each case. Except as regards difficulty in the recovery of certain joint claims of his and the Sirdar Bahadur's against the Persian Government variously given by them as 18,000 and 25,000 tomans, he did not otherwise fall foul again of the Eevenue Department. He was in indifferent health and suffering from a worrying skin affection which two visits to Mahun in May and June and one to Lalazar in July did not alleviate. A private arrangement which he tried to work with the Gover nor of Yezd for bringing the Shahar-i-Babak district under Kerman only led to a disturbance and had to be abandoned. He was also unsuccessful in an attempt to get the Shahab-us-Sultaneh appointed Deputy-Governor of Yezd. The disturbance in Bam which took him and the Consul to that place is treated elsewhere. He wished to introduce reforms into the Carpet Factories especially to prohibit boys and girls working together and to regulate the hours of work but found the matter too difficult. The Sirdar-i-Muhtasham's chief aim and object in accepting the Kerman appointment was to organise2:2; PERSIAN GtFLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT an expedition into Baluchistan. With this end in view he fathered the mission of the Mishah-i-Diwan to Baluchistan, but when the latter found himself unable to get further than Charbar and asked for pecuniary assistance,, he washed his hands of him. He clung, however, as long as he could to the hope of marching into Baluchistan and was much aggrieved at not being- supported in his project and at having to give it up. His Governorship does^ not appear to have been particularly noteworthy in any way and he is chiefly remembered locally for his close-fistedness. The history of Eudbar during the year was uneventful. The Zargham-i- Kizam retained his usual authority and Eudba^, appears to have exercised it wisely. The district remained peaceful and the Rudbaris refrained from any interference with caravans on the Bandar Abbas road. The Afshars remained well-behaved throughout the year and did not even indulge in their usual internal feuds. Afshar. Caravans passed unmolested through their district. Husain Khan Buchaqchi committed a robbery early in the year and tried to stir up mischief but without success. Sl^J ' an ■ A small force of Gendarmes was posted in Sirjan town and their presence there, though not an unmixed blessing, seems to have afforded protection to the district which escaped its usual harrassings. from its western neighbours. In January, a caravan was looted by Fars robbers but the local authorities,. by prompt and energetic action, recovered Rafsmjan. the lost property and punished the robbers so successfully that they had peace for the rest of the year. Complaints were made of oppression against the Rafat-ud-Dowleh, but His Majesty's Consul did not consider that the Kifaat was any worse than the average Governor. Jiruft was again swept by Baluch raiders in Tebruary and suffered badly ; over a hundred of the inhabitants were said to have been killed. Luckily no caravans were in Jiruft at the time except one which was caught at Dasht-i- Kuch. Otherwise the year was uneventful. Early in Eebmary a strong force of Baluchis, estimated at from 1,000 ' to 3^000, invaded Narmashir. The Gover nor of Bam marched out against them, but beyond surrounding him in Abbasabad the Baluchis did not take any notice of him, and continued their advance as far as Darzin where they entren ched themselves and waited the attack of the Gendarmes who had advanced from Kerman to meet them. The Gendarmes blundered on to them there and engaged them throughout the day and at nightfall, finding themselves nearly run out of ammunition, retired, on Tahrud. The Gendarmes lost three men killed and three wounded and claim to have inflicted a loss of one hundred on the enemy, but this number is improbable. After the fight the Baluchis retired through Narmashir again, while the Gendarmes awaited reinforcements of men and ammunition. On receiving these they advanced to Bam, but by then the Baluchis were the other end of Narmashir. The local authorities tried to persuade the Gendarmes to follow up the Baluchis but they wisely refused and, after waiting to make sure that there was no truth in the reports that the Baluchis intended to advance again, returned to Kerman. It was part of this Baluch force that raided Jiruft on its way home. At the end of March there was again a scare of another Baluch raid but happily it did not eventuate, as the defences of Bam then consisted of sixty mutinous Sarbazes and one broken gun, the Merat-i-Sultan with the reinforcements and serviceable gun sent in February, having been recalled to Kerman. Throughout April the people of Narmashir remained in terror of further Baluch raids. In May the new Governor, the Salar-i-Akram, arrived in Bam with one hundred Bakhti- ari sowars who soon raised the whole town against them by their violence and oppression and the Governor-General had to send a Commissioner to enquire into their behaviour, after which matters improved. In June andPOE THE TEAR 1914. 23 July tliere were serioiis complaints by the. Bam Khans against the Deputy- ■Governor Ismail Khan which resulted in his dismissal. The elections for the Majlis were the occasion of serious disturbance in Bam. Ihe Nazim-ut-Tujjar was one of the successful candidates, but his return was challenged by the Khans who accused him of undue influence and fraud in obtaining votes. Thereupon the Nazim and his supporters closed the bazaars and flocked to the Eritish Telegraph Office to take bast The situation became so threatening that the Governor-General and His IVIaiesty's Consul with a mixed force of Gendarmes and Bakhtiaris had to proceed to Bam. As persuasion and remonstrance were equally unsuccessful in drawing out the Bastis it became necessary to expel them by force. The staff were successfully got out of the Telegraph premises and these were surrounded by the Gendarmes and Bakhtiaris who began to close in on them from all sides. As soon as the Bastis saw that no more nonsense was going to be stood they began to^stream out of the Telegraph compound and make for their homes. The desired ^ object was thus being bloodlessly obtained when, unfortunately, the Bakhtiaris on one side got out of haod and opened fire without orders, a few lives being thus unnecessarily sacrificed. The Nazim was caught and narrowly escaped summary execution. The Governor-General hesitated at inflicting the extreme penalty and carried him back to Kerman as a pri soner. The departure of the Nazim restored quiet and the year finished with out further incident. No event of general public interest occurred in Kerman during the year. The affairs of Kerman City. Tlie outbreak of the European War did not cause any general excitement, and even the entry of Turkey into the fray did not work up any interest in it. At first a few Persians hoped that Germany might drive Bussia and England out of Persia or so occupy them that they would have no time to think of Persia, but as soon as they saw that the attention of neither was in any way lessened they gave up thinking about the War. The War naturally seriously affected the Carpet industry, as the European firms were immediately in monetary difficulties and had consequently to cut down orders and advances of money to the weavers The position became very difficult and was made more so by the action of the Karguzar who persistently encouraged the weavers in a foolish policy of refusing either to honestly work off the advances which they had received or to return the advances. Though heavily overstocked the firms as a matter of policy tried to keep the industry working part time at any rate but naturally refused to advance money for work which they knew would not be done. The consequence is that a number of the weavers are piling up broken contracts and claims for advances made on them, while the firms can get neither their carpets nor their money from the weavers. His Majesty's Consul tried to effect the removal of the Karguzar but without success and matters remained at a dead-lock. The Karguzar, Moham-ul-Mulk, arrived here in debt, and contracted more debts on arrival ; he from the first showed strong anti-European feeling, and before the end of the year all the European firms had withdrawn all cases from his Court and refused to institute any new ones. What with Baluch raiders driving off the flocks and transport animals and the War dislocating imports from abroad all food and other necessaries of life advanced greatly in price. This coupled with a serious contraction of money naturally caused a good deal of distress by the end of the year. The Gendarmerie did not open the year very auspiciously. With a little a,, ^ , . forethought and elementary tactics they ^ Thfi (iprinfirrnprip ^ '****? V* dlVAOii llld 1C. • 1 i 1 • 1 'I -T-v 1 1 • 1 might have given the Baluchis a lesson which they would have remembered for years. They chose, however, to rush off without guides, supports or even a proper supply of ammunition .; they blundered on to the Baluchis without intention in a strongly defen sive position from which they were unable to dislodge them, and having exhausted their ammunition had to retire under cover of night thereby allowing the Baluchis to withdraw unmolested and able to boast -that the attack had been successfully driven off. This was naturally a serious «hlow to their prestige. Their unsuccessful attempt to elbow the Governor-24 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTEATION REPOKT General out of his garden did not help them to restore it. At the instigation of Mr. Lecoffre, the financial Agent, Colonel Glimstedt, formed ideas of afc- sorbino the Local Police force and abolishing the Local Military force and road- guards' and so leaving the Qendarmerie as the only force in the district. With this, of course, Mr. Lecoffre and Colonel Glimstedt would have ruled the dis trict. The idea though fascinating was unrealisahle and was not seriously pushed. Their methods of recruiting brought them into conflict again with the Governor-General and elicited complaints from villages that the recruiting parties were using press-gang methods. Though they made no actual prepara tion for getting out on to the road they at any rate realised that it was the primary object to protect which they had been sent here and Captain de Mare and Colonel Glimstedt took parties of their men down to Bandar Abbas and back to recornoitre the different routes and get some idea of how to organise their protection. They did not get beyond a general opinion that the Baft route was the best and so far they'have not even got a paper scheme rf posts and patrols for any route. At the end of the year orders arrived for a delachment to be sent to Shiraz and for the remainder of the force, except a small barrack- guard, to return to Tehran, and early in the new year they departed from Kerman Whetner they will ever return or not we can only ' wait and see.'

Mr. Lecoffre, the Head of the Department, sat inaccessibly in his office and required all complaints to be made in writing on stamped paper and these, of course, were re^er allowed to reach him. He himself accepted presents of carpets, a watch, ring, etc., and was naturally given the credit of taking money as well. Under the circum stances it was only to be expected that the subordinates should think that they had a free hand. The outcry against the worst offender the Amin-i-Maliya, Mirza Ibrahim Khan, was so Joud that the Treasurer-General had to be moved to dismiss him and even then the greatest pressure had to be brought to bear on Mr. Lecoffre before he would carry out the order. The people of the Kerman district are not high-spirited, and, in spite of illegal exactions, the revenue is easily enough collected and, in the absence of all public works or improvements of any sort, the expenses of the district are not great. So Mr. Lecoffre was able to announce that the district would be self-supporting after September. This is, of course, very comforting to Tehran, who are only too pleased to know that they need not send down any more money and do not care how this happy result has been brought about, but is not a source of much self-congratulation to the Kerman district itself. Mr. Lecoffre made full use of his advantage as holder of the purse and as self-constituted Agent-Gene al of the Gendarmerie to obstruct and worry the Governor-General as much as possible. He remained as autocratic as ever accepting orders as subject to his own approval even, as mentioned above, those from his own chief. His unfortunajbe temper causes His Majesty's Consul much unnecessary trouble, and his personal reputation does not enhance British prestige. The Moham-ul-Mulk was appointed Karguzar in January, but did not The Kar uzari arrive in Kerman until April. He is a North-Persian Turk who has spent a num ber of years in Constantinople, where he apparently picked up Young Turk ideas and a st rong anti-European bias. He showed it plainly from the first but it did not become serious until the outbreak of the War. All the European firms were much affected by the dislocation oE the money-markets and were obliged to economise as far as possible. It was a matter which required care ful handling and co-operation between all concerned to effect this without per manent detriment to the whole Carpet industry. Instead of helping to make things easy the Karguzar encouraged those of the weavers who were unreason able and obstructive and openly showed such animus against the European Eirms that His Majesty's Consul was obliged to ask for his dismissal. He, however, possessed strong influence in Tehran and his dismissal had not been achieved when the year ended.

In April there was fighting between Ahmed Khan and Ashraf Khan but no casualties on either side were reported.

The district continues to be administered by Mir Mustafa Khan, and the condition generally throughout the Jask District. y ear has been satisfactory. ^ The Chief himself is a quiet, well intentioned man, a bit weak perhaps, but he is well liked bv the people he governs as he does not burden them with heavy taxes, and looting, so far as looting of people of all they possess, a common occurrence in the Mekran, is unknown in this part of Persian Baluchistan. The Chief s eldest son, Mir Chiragh Din, gets a bit out of hand at times and has, on two occasions during the year, lifted a camel, each time the property ot our line establishment at .Task, which his father has had to return as the youngster had disposed of the animal before action could be taken. Mir Mustafa Khan has been very friendly with his younger brother Mir Barkat, rendering assistance whenever possible, but for this he can hardly be blamed as it pays him to keep on the good side of a powerful man like his brother. Mir Hoti of Jask is of very little use to anyone, he has no following and very little influence in any part of the country, but he gives no trouble and does bis best to look after our interests in a humble way. Mir Haji was, up to very recently, the ruler of this part of Persian Baluchistan, but after his death Mir Biaban District. Barkat assumed control of the district and it is said will be recognized by the Persian authorities in due course. Trouble continued throughout the year between these two Chiefs, small engage ments periodically occurring in which a few casualties have each time been reported. The ill-feeling between these two has existed for a number ot years. Besides, Barkat has never forgotten the part played by Mir Haji m connection with the murder of his younger brother Muhammad Khan towards the end of July 1912, and the fighting which took place on the 20th October last and which ended in the death of Mir Haji was an act Barkat has indirectly long been trvine to accomplish. Mir Haji was too weak a ruler for an ^ important district like Biaban, and it would be quite a good thing if ttaPeman autho rities recognised Barkat. Several stories in connection with Mir i ±a;ji s cLeatn had reached me, but the following is as true a report as one can expect trom people who are in the habit of exaggerating anything in connection witn a fight. Por some unknown reason all the Tahrzai tribe—a small and wariiKe t r ibe—deserted Mir Haii and joined Mir Barkat on his arrival at a place called Kardir, a small village in the Biaban district. These men on deserting Haji ursred Barkat to fight and left with the latter and 20 followers for Mishi where they looted all the property there belonging to Mir Haji's ryots. The villagers of Mishi complained to Mir Haji at Sirik, who sent a man to Barkat asking for an explanation. Barkat's reply was to the effect that lie had several blood feuds to settle with Haji and that he had come with the intention or settling them, more particularly that of his brother Muhammad Khan, ^a] 1 agree to settle the latter, only urging that he was quits as regards the others as Barkat in turn had killed many of his slaves from time to time. Ihis repl^ was considered unsatisfactory by Barkat, who said Haji had killed Baluc i ryots of his, the slaves he had killed of Haji's could not be recognised as belonging to the same class and that he wanted compensation according y. Barkat then proceeded to Sirik. Haji offered his youngest son in place or e late Muhammad Khan saying he could shoot him if that would be any conso a- tion to Barkat. This offer Barkat refused to accept and he was ur ^ ci if f A people to take compensation in the shape of property, animals, e tc., but ^ e or a decision was arrived at, the Tahrzai tribe warned Barkat that lla]i preparing to fight and the Chief then sent his followers to surround t e o in which Haji had taken refuge. It is stated that Haji's men tired the shot and after this firing was general and lasted ov ^ r an ^ ur * .. a on it transpired that, at the commencement of the fight, Mir looking out of a window, being surprised to hear the report ot . ® ^ received a bullet in his head kiliing him instantaneously, 11'om the re_POE THE YEAR 1914. 31 received it would appear that much ammunition had been expended but th* casualty list was small—one killed (Mir Haji) and three wSed on b S sides. Barkat then returned to Mishi and is now disarming the people and it is said that it is his intention to turn all Haji's sons out of the district Mirza Khan of Eudbar is said to be taking up cudgels on behalf of the late Mir Hap s sons, and it is reported ne is collecting a following and pre paring to fight BarKat. Hajis second son Gul Muhammad Khan marr ed one of Mirza Khan s daughters, and it is expected this Chief will oivo CVat a deal of trouble in the immediate future. olVe iiarkat At the time of writing, reports from Biaban and other sources are reach ing me to the effect that Mir Gul Muhammad Khan, assisted by Mirza Khan has collected a force and is leaving Mauooja with the intention of brimnn* Barkat to book at once. Barkafis said to be ready and a fight is expected shortly In my opinion nothing beyond a small scrap or two will occur ; the average Baluchi dislikes serious fighting and the shedding of a little blood invariabiv causes an immediate retirement on both sides. ^ The district of Baslikard is under the immediate control of Mirza Khan of Eudbar, who sub-let a portion to Barkat, but within the last few months some ill-feeling has sprung up between the two and Mirza Khan relieved Barkat of his portion. In all probability this is the cause of the recpnt which resulted in the death of Mir Haji. ^ Mir Barkat is well disposed towards the British Government, all claims against him by our employees have been settled, but so far he has not complet ed the deposit of lis 5,000 required of him by the Political authorities a balance of Rs. 1,500 still remaining due. Since Barkat's behaviour of late as far as our interests are concerned, has been extremely satisfactory, I think it would be advisable if the Rs. 3,500 deposited with the clerk in chaw:, Jask Station, be accepted as the maximum security required and the Chief be granted the pardon he is so anxious to obtain. This district continues to be under the charge of Sirdar Saiyid Khan, Gam District. from all reports, is said to be fast losing his authority owing to his irregular habits, being addicted to opium eating and smoking. The Bampur district is still under his control, the Persian Governor-General of Kerman havino* leased it to him for the past several years, and so lony as the revenue demanded by that official is regularly paid there seems to be no probability of the Persian Government putting their own man in as Governor. Besides,' it pays Sirdar Saiyid Khan to keep the place under his control, knowing full well that the appointment of a Persian official means ruin to the country generally. In former years the Persian Governor of Bampur annually made a tour through Persian Baluchistan collecting taxes personally, now Sirdar Saiyid Khan has undertaken this duty, handing over a fixed sum yearly to the Kerman authorities. Very little of any interest has transpired during the year, occasional fight ing has taken place between the different Chiefs and Headman, the most import tant of which is said to be the following ;— {a) Sirdar Islam Khan of Bint, a nephew of Saiyid Khan, is the coming Chief in these parts, and on or about the end of July last it was reported that there was some ill-feeling between uncle and nephew which resulted in a scrap at Fanuch lasting a whole day and the death of one of Saiyid Khan's followers. Apparently peace was patched up immediately after because Islam Khan, assisted by Saiyid Khan proceeded a few days later to Kutaich, 50 miles from Panuch, and looted one Chiragh Khan of 12 camels and also killed one of his men. (6) A squabble between Sirdar Bahram Khan of Dizak and his ryots is reported to have occurred about the same time as the above. One Shai Mehran, a man of influence, murdered one Mehr Dil. Bahram Khan summoned Shai Mehran to Sarbaz to enquire into the matter, the enquiry ending in a fight in which Sbai Mehran and 6 others were killed, Bahram Khan losing 5 killed and one wounded.32 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT (&lt;?) Another fight between Mir Moosa Khan and Sarfraz Khan, brothers ol ; Eustam Khan, and an outlaw named Piri is said to have taken place at Kasserkand in September last. Piri has of late been looting and oppressing the people of the district and it was desirable that he should be captured. Hearing of Piri's where abouts the Chiefs came to Dadati, about 6 miles north of Kas- serkand, and found the outlaw and his followers had taken refuge on a hill close by. The place was surrounded and in a fight lasting 4 hours Piri was captured after losing 4 killed and a few wounded. The man is now a prisoner but it is not decided what punishment he is to receive. Two Chiefs control this section of Persian Baluchistan, Mir Mahmud Khan and his nephew Mir Din Muham- Dashtiari District. ^ ^ Headqi;|arters of ^ former being Talang and the latter at Mirai Bazaar. There was a slight improvement in the relationship between the two last year, but at present there is a deal of ill-feeling prevailing owing to Din Muhammad's headstrong behaviour. Din Muhammad at the time of his father's death, in 1906, was a minor and the district was then divided, a portion going to Mir Mahmud Khan his uncle. Since obtaining his majority he has always considered this an injustice and it has been a source of friction between these men. The telegraph subsidy was also divided at the same time, thus adding to Din Mu hammad's discontent. He contends that his father Mir Abdi Khan was sole Chief of the district, drawing all the revenues also the full telegraph subsidy, and he considers it a hardship having now to share it with his uncle. It is reported that the situation in Dashtiari at present is critical, both Chiefs being ready to take the offensive at any moment. Sirdar Saiyid Khan is said to be secretly assisting Din Muhammad and Sirdar Islam Shan helping Mahmud in his quarrel with his nephew. Din Muhammad is said to have threatened to collect a force and attack the Charbar Station recently, but in my opinion this is all talk. A Baluchi Chief of these parts would never dare to attack a place which is partially fortified and garrisoned by Indian troops. Besides when a chief has a grievance against the Government, he always begins by in* terfering with the line staff and threatens to cut the wires, but as this has not occurred it can be assumed that nothing will come of the threat. This district is under the dual control of Mirs Ashraf and Ahmed Khan and the feeling between these two Chiefs Bahu District. . g ^ything but satisfactory, a state of affairs which has been in existence quite a number of years now. Frequently petty quarrels are always being reported. Ahmed Khan is an unscrupulous man, willing to take advantage of any opportunity to harm Mir Ashraf, who is anything but a strong man in managing his affairs. Whatever the private quarrels between these two Chiefs may be, their feelings] towards the Govern ment are quite friendly. British Indian subjects are free to move anywhere on business and the line establishment and line are never interfered with in any way. The exportation of slaves from the Mekran to the Arab Coast has practi cally ceased, no cases having been brought to my notice during the year under report, but slaves continue to change hands in the country. There was an exceptionally good rainfall last winter and the rains up ^ to date ample to commence with, consequently the country is in a flourishing condition. The War with Turkey has up to date had no effect on the people of the country ; the only Chief, Islam Khan, I have met so far informed me that he had heard of the capture of Basrah and also of its recapture by the Turks, but t . as he did not appear to be very interested in the doings of his co-religionists* J allowed the conversation to drop.FOR THE TEAE 19U. 33 CHAPTER VI administration eeport for the arabistan consulate for the year 1914.

The Governorship of Arabistan was held by Ijlal-es-Sultaneh up to May then for a time it was carried on by the Shaikh of Mohammerah, until June when His Excellency Nizam-us-Sultaneh was appointed Govern or-General of Arabistan and Luristan. After considerable delay in Tehran, which he utilized in getting a loan from the Imperial Bank of Persia on the security of some of his lands, the Nizam reached Khurramabad in August. He had been specially appointed to pacify Luristan, but was unable to do much. In fact his efforts seemed to be confined to fleecing anyone he could, and to pressing the Government by every means and through all possible channels for money. He remained at Khurramabad and Burujird and never visited Arabistan during the year. ° The Government of Shushtar was carried on by Itesam-ul-Mamalik until January, when he was dismissed and Vakar-ul-Mulk succeeded him. The latter was transferred to Dizful in June and was relieved by Darab Khan, a Local Chief, who remained Deputy Governor till the end of the year. The Government of Dizful was in the hands of Sirdar Khan until June, when Vakar-ul-Mulk was transferred there. The latter retained the Governor ship till the end of the year. Ikram-ul-Mulk was Karguzar of Mohammerah throughout the year. His brother Mirza Ahmed Khan, Mutazid-ul-Vizareh, who is a sort of hanger-on of his, received a telegram, in May, appointing him Karguzar of Ahwaz, but he never took up the appointment. The office of Karguzar at Mohammerah is a sinecure as all business is done with the Shaikh and Haji Rais or the Deputy Governor. Monsieur Bouckaert was in charge of the Mohammerah Customs until the Custom8 end of May, when he became ill and left for Bushire, where he died on the 5th June. He was succeeded by Monsieur Van den Abeele, who showed signs of heing a great stickler for the letter of the Reglement, but later on he became much more amenable. The principal events of the year, to take them in consecutive order, were Principal events tiie r aid by Shaikh Ghazban into Arabis- p tan, the War with Germany and the entry of Turkey into the War. S f£4, GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Towards the end of June a disturbance broke out amongst the Arabs of the Dizful Mianab and Shaikh Ghazban shaikh Ghazban. 0 f ^6 Bani Lam, who was evidently act- in- in co-operation, appeared on the Khaikah with a number of sowars The Shaikh ac once mobilised a large number of his levies and proceeded to Ahwaz. A force was sent out under the command of Shaikh Hanzal Khan, the Shaikh's nephew. 'Jhe operations were not an unqualified success as Shaikh Ghazban was too elusive for the Shaikh's troops. Eventually an arrangement was arrived and a truce patched up. and the Shaikh returned to Mobammerah on 16th August. Shaikh Ghazban was by no means disposed of as he made another raid m September, but on this occasion he was defeated by a section of the Chaab tribe, which had been with him on the former occasion. The outbreak of the War in Europe at the end of July and the beginning of August was watched with interest here. The Wa^ • This interest became more personal^ as the Turkish authorities at Basrah soon showed their hostility to the Allies, and beo-an a policy of pinpricks. The Valis of Baghdad and Basrah were very hostile, and, as soon as Turkey began mobilising early in August, at once seized the opportunity to worry British merchants by requisitioning coal and oil and stores and transport animals. On the nisrht of i9th August all British ships at Basrah were recommended to leave the port by His Britannic Majesty's Consul there and did so. The next morning, in view of the fact that the whole river was claimed by Turkey, the ships left the Shatt-el-Arab For some time no ships came up the river to Mohammerah and no mail steamers came between August 13th and September 13th. The oil tankers for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Hefinery at Abadan came up regularly however. At the end of September, relations being apparently less strained with Turkey, several ships came up the river to load dates and the mail came regularly until October 28th, when all steamers were again told to leave the river owing to War with Turkey being imminent. Directly the War in Europe began the Turks began to strengthen their m ,., .. position alonff the river and, in September oris p.epaia ions. aiLC [ October, considerable efforts were made. Some more guns were sent to Eao ; detachments were placed at various points along the river, including one opposite Abadan. On 22nd October a detachment with two guns was placed immediately opposite the mouth of the Karun. In October the old corvette ' Kalid-el-Bahr,' the S. S. c&lt; John O. Scott,' 'Jaffari' and finally the Hamburg-Amerika liner S. S. 'Ekbatana' were successively sunk at ' Muffris ' between Shamsummiyeh Island and the right bank of the Shatt with a view to blocking the channel. Eairly strong detachments were placed at Baljaniyeh and at the Turkish boundary on the left bank to cover the block in the river. In the meantime, although it was not the policy of His Majesty's Govern- AmmgemenlB made by His Majesty's Govern- ment to take any action which Could be ment and the shaikh. interpreted by the Turks as a menace and made an excuse for joining in the War, something was done on our side. On the 16th September H M. S. Odin' arrived and remained anchored outside the mouth of the Karun until relieved by H. M. S. ' Espiegle,' on the 2Sth September, when she went down the river and acted as guardship off the Eao Bar H. M S. ' Dalhousie' arrived on 23rd September and remained in the neighbourhood of Abadan till the middle of October, when she left for Bushire. The Vali of Basrah protested against the presence of H. M. S.

In the case of the c&lt; Espiegle ' the Vali was more threatening in tone and sent a letter to the Commander saying that if he did not leave within 24 hours he would not be allowed to leave. The ' Espiegle ' was actually anchored in the Karun so that the Vali of Basrah had no grounds for intervening at all. The matter was referred to His Majesty's Government, who decided to keep the ship at Mohammerah. When the Turks placed a post opposite Abadan, the Shaikh raised the strength of his guard there first to 100 men and then to about 200 men. He also collected a large number of levies at Mohammerah and at his palace atfOE THE TBAE 1914. 35 Paitiyeh with a view to protecting his neutrality when the Turkish authorities fiiyeh 0PI,0S 6 ' Un aild 011 ^ left baak of 4)19 SlLtt above During the months of September and October the Shaikh received many Turkish Authorities aad the Shaikh. letters and messages from Subhi Bev 4. t • j it, ac ^ T1 S Vali of Basrah, appealinsr to him on rehgious and other grounds to join with the Turks. After Djlvid Pasha Vah of Baghdad, announced his intention of coming to Basrah at the end of October, these messages became quite threatening, and the Shaikh was considerably exercised by them, as he had a wholesome fear of Diavid Very great assistance in encouraging the Shaikh was given by his Vizier, Haii Kais, who worked hard in cheering up the Shaikh and haranguing the Mullahs and Headmen of the tribes m opposition to the ' Jihad ' propaganda started by the Turks He continued to do this in spite of being denounced as a ' kafir ' and threatened with being shot. In short, he was extremely helpful and had so much work aud worry that he became quite ill. During this period Saiyid Talib of Basrah made several overtures to His Majesty's Consul at Basrah and to His Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah, both directly and through the Shaikh, to help the British Government. He made such ridiculous demands, however, that his offers of assistance were rejected. After the raid into Egypt and the attack on Odessa, on the 29th October, Advance of Indian Expeditionary Force ' D.' a state of War with Turkey supervened and the small Expeditionary Force which had been sent by His Majesty's Government to Bahrain came up to the head of the Gulf.

During the advance up the river the Shaikh was of great assistance in giving information of the enemy's movements as his tribesmen on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab kept him well informed. Any information likely to be of use was sent by His Majesty's Consul by the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany's telephone and wireless to the Chief Political Officer with the Expe ditionary Eorce. The General Manager of the head office at Mohammerah and his staff and the Manager of the Abadan Refinery gave all possible assistance. On the evening of the 28th reliable information was received by the Occupation of B^rah. Shaikh that Basrah was evacuated by the Turks in the early morning. No time was lost in communicating this to the Expeditionary Eorce, and it was decided to send up a strong reconnoitring party the next day. On the morning of the 2ist, however, a deputation of British and other merchants came down from Basrah and reported that the Turks had left, and that the Customs House and several other places were being looted by the bad characters of the place. H. M. S. 44 Espiegle,' Odin, ' and ' Lawrence ' were at once sent np to try and find a way past the obstruction at Shamsummiyeh. This they did and vent to Basrah reaching there at nightfall. The troops made a forced march on the night of the 21st and reached Basrah on the 22nd. The town speedily became quiet.

In August and again in November great inconvenience was experienced by the total collapse of the old line at very critical times. The Mohammerah-Ahwaz section was renewed in December. The Consulate was joined to the Basrah-Pao line and an office opened for Government work by the Indian Expeditionary Eorce u D' on the 1st December. Owing to the disturbed state of the country no progress was made with the Hog ital proposal mentioned in last year's report. The dispensary maintained by Govern ment and worked by the Quarantine Medical Officer continued to do good work. This was completed in a rough way as far as funds would permit.

In the months of September, Octo- Bntisn interests. f i - xt i xI ber, and early November there was con siderable anxiety lest some attack should be made by the Turks, or by Arabs at their instigation, on the Abadan Eefinery. Great credit is due to the Manager, Mr. Neilson, and the other officials that no scare arose among the employees. Admiralty and other tankers came up and took cargoes practically without interruption. Shipping business after the beginning of the War was much handicapped, and the export of dates was curtailed, Messrs. Lynch Brothers suffered a good deal of loss by the seizure of several of their steamers and tugs by the Turks. The firm of Messrs. Hobert Wonckhaus and Company was represented by _ ... , Mr. Eandall until July, after which Mr. Foreign interests. Hoist and for a short time Mr. Neilson represented it. During the early part of the year the firm made a strong bid for the carrying trade on the Karun and had some success. Messrs. Lynch Brothers seemed to be holding their own just before the War started; after that, of course, the German business practically ceased. In August, the newly appointed Royal Italian Consul for the Gulf passed through Mohammerah en route to Tehran on leave. He expressed his inten tion of trying to get away from the Gulf and has not returned. The Shaikh had a meeting with Sirdar-i-Jang and Sirdar Bahadur on the o. Mi. JT-It^- • 10th May. The meeting was a friendly Shaikh and Takhtians. ^ ~ p ,t&gt;«i i, one, the only grievance of the Bakhtians against the Shaikh was his loyalty to his friend the Amir Mujahid, who is yery unpopular with the other Khans.

The charge of the Vice Consulate Dispensary was held throughout the year by Sub-Assistant Surgeon Fazal Illahi, through whose efforts the Dispensarv has maintained its high standard of efficiency and popularity with the local and surrounding population. The total number of new patients treated was 12 and 380 major and minor operations were performed.

Owing to the intrigues of Yussef Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, who proceeded to Turkey in May, Husain Khan, Bahmai, attacked Path Ali Khan, Salar-i- Muazzem, the Bakhtiari Governor designate, while en route to Behbehan and then went into rebellion with his tribe. This necessitated a punitive expedition, which the Ilkhani himself commanded. After 3 months' desultory fightin*, Husain Khan was surrounded in his Port of Likkak, and surrendered through the mediation of Muhammad Khan, Sirdar-i-Azam. Husain Khan was taken into the Upper Country to Junaghan, and was later sent to Sarita, a village near Ham Hormuz, where he remained up to the end of the year.38 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT The Port of Likkak was razed to the ground, and the headship of the tribe entrusted to Muhammad Husain Khan, Bahmai.

Subsequent on the satisfactory arrangements made by Sirdar-i-Jang, Bakhtiari Road. Ilkhani, for the protection of the road, traffic was in full swing throughout the year with the exception of a short time in the Summer. A raid by the Kuhgelu was threatened in June, but averted. The activities of Reza Khan, Juzuni in the Ispahan District, had the effect, for a short time in the Summer, of reducing the number of caravans passing to and fro, but this trouble was removed on the Ispahan Gendarmerie taking active steps against Reza Khan and forcing him to leave the road in peace. In the Spring rises the new stone bridge, built by Sirdar-i-Jang over the Sabza Kuh River at Dopulan, was washed away, and has not since been rebuilt. 'When passing over the Godar-i-Balutak bridge in October, His Majesty's Yice-Consul noticed that one of the anchorages was drawing. This was brought to the notice of Messrs.

He has not since returned to Saiyid Salim bin Faisal visited Debai in September, returning to Maskat in December. Owing to the vagaries of the mail service, however, he was detain ed on the way.

The Political Agent, accompanied by the Agency Surgeon, paid a congratulatory visit to His High ness the Sultan. The Imam, Salim bin Eashid al Kharusi, continued to give trouble Condition of -country. throughout the year in the interior. His hostile preparations for an attack on Maskat were on several occasions a source of considerable anxiety to His Highness. In April, owing to the threatening attitude of the Oman tribes on the coast, where British interests are especially centered and where the rebels had collected, the ports of Barka and Karyat were bombarded by H. M. S. ' Fox ' and ' Dartmouth 55 respectively. ^ This had a temporarily tranquillising effecl: and little was heard of actual activity on the part of the rebels untib August, when a hostile movement was again set on foot, which had the combined support of Shaikh Isa bin Saleh al Harithi and Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir, the Imam's chief Lieutenants. In November the situation became so serious that reinforcements were sent to Maskat. A large hostile gathering of the tribes took place in December and Maskat and Matrah were threatened. By the end of the year the situation had become extremely critical. {N B.—Since the end of the year the threatened attack has taken place. A force of Arabs estimated at ^,000 attacked the British outpost line, on 11th January 1915, and met with a crushing defeat, their casualties being estimated at 350. The British casualties were 7 rank and file killed and 15 wounded, of whom one was a British officer slightly wounded.) The Maskat Arms Warehouse has worked well during the year and has „ fully -justified its establishment. There Arms Traffic. . J J . ,1 , n- tt- 1 is no reason to suppose that His Highness has not loyally co-operated in every way to make it a success. A glance at the usual returns, which are appended to this report, will show that the import of arms and ammunition into Maskat has ceased. The year's imports amount to the almost negligible sum of B3,860 as against the £3,84,902 of the year 1913 and 1133,64,485 of 1912. Of the year's imports, Rl,500 re presents value of arms and ammunition imported in German bottoms and the balance by British ships. The entire imports represent 25 cases ammunition for His Highness' use and 5 rifles and 2,500 rounds ammunition for the personal use of Saiyid Yusuf az Zuwawi. Three cases of machine guns and 52 cases ammunition and accessories im ported by His Highness from a French firm in German bottoms do not, however, appear in these returns as their value was not declared. The stock of French arms, of which an inventory was made in August 1913 and which were placed under the seals of the two Governments, were on42 PERSIAN GULP ADMINISTRATION REPORT beinc acquired by His Majesty's Government, finally taken over by the British Consul, who was assisted by a Committee specially appointed for tbe purpose in the month of August 1914i. Tue statement hereto annexed and marked A shows how the Erench stocks were finally disposed of. In the month of May 3 Afghans, posing as paupers on a pilgrimage, travelled from Dera Ismail Khan to Bombay and thence came to Maskat Aden in a sailing vessel. They were arrested in Matrah. A sum of 114,200 in currency notes and gold was found concealed on their persons together with certain papers which clearlv showed that their real mission w T as the illicit purchase of arms. They were accordingly tried by His Britannic Majesty's Consul and found guilty of a breach of the Maskat Arms Warehouse Eegula- tions. A fine of 54,200 was imposed on theni and they were deported to Karachi, where they were arrested and further tried by the Indian authorities and sentenced to undergo a term of imprisonment. One, Abdulla bin Muhammad al Katuria, a Maskat subject, was arrested in July smuggling arms and ammunition and rifle accessories to Matrah, where Baluch arms dealers awaited him. He, together with the arms, was handed over to the Local Government for disposal. Again, in October, Abdulla was found implicated in the smuggling of arms, and on this occasion the Local Government awarded him 3 months' imprisonment in Eort Jelali. All the Erench arms merchants left Maskat for good during the year under report, except Monsieur Elbaz, who has large outstandings in Kuwait, Bahrain and in Oman. In the course of the year Monsieur Elbaz visited Kuwait, Bahrain and Katr for the purpose of collecting his dues but had little or no success. He has disposed of his dhows and is also trying to dispose of his Warehouses and other landed property in Maskat, but has not been able to obtain favourable offers. The public health has been good on the whole. The outbreak of small-pox referred to in last year's report continued Public Health, Hospital and Quarantine. during the first 6 months of the year under report. The epidemic, however, was confined to Matrah only. There were a few cases of black water fever, 2 of which proved fatal. The Agency Hospital was open for the public, and the number of patients treated during the year was 6,191, the daily average being 17 '14. Quarantine arrangements, under the supervision of the Agency Surgeon, have worked well during the year. Two pilgrim ships visited Maskat during the year. No trouble of any kind was experienced, the arrangements PUgrim8 ' for pilgrims being found satisfactory. The Customs management has remained in the hands of a paid Superin tendent, Salem bin Abdulla al Khaimn, Customs and Landiug. ^ ^ of This man ^ gave a good deal of trouble to British merchants by the unnecessary detention of their goods. Many of the old Indian employes of the Customs resigned during the year owing to his treatment of them. His conduct was brought to the notice of His Highness the Sultan, who severely reprimanded the Superintendent in the presence of the Political Agent, and since then there has been a marked improvement. Complaints of pilfering have been few. The Landing contract, which was in the hands of 4 Arabs, was this year given to Saiyid Yusuf az Zuwawi, to whom, it is said, His Highness is very much indebted. Saiyid Yusuf appointed his son, Saiyid Abdul Kadir, a most undesirable individual, to manage the business. British merchants protested strongly against this. The matter was represented to His Highness the Sultan, who at once ordered the removal of Saiyid Abdul Kadir from all connection with the Landing arrangements. Occasional complaints have been receive from the local Shipping Agents and merchants of insufficiency of lighters ana consequent delay in port resulting in the over-caniage of cargo.Km THE YEAH 1914; 43 During the year under report, applications for freedom were received from Slave Trade. ^ slaves, of whom. 34i were freed, 1 ab- f a p - r , . , sconded and 1 was repatriated.

In November the members of the Mission in the Persian Gulf held their annual conference in Maskat. Heverend Eather Bernard of the Carmelite Mission visited Maskat from Bushire in May. In the month of January telegraphic information was received from the Eainfali and Weather. Political Resident, Aden, of the wreck of the Greek steamer 'Aliki' at Merbat. The Resident, Aden, requested arrangements to be made through the Sultan for the protection and safety of the salvors. The matter was referred to His Highness the Sultan but no assistance could be sent firstly owing to there not being any of His Majesty's Ships available at the time and secondly because no lives or property of British subjects were involved. The ship was given up as a total wreck. The rainfall for the year amounted to 5*45 inches more than the last year. The summer was long and severe.

The Trucial Coast has, this year, suffered severely from the ravages of General. plague and, perhaps more than any part 0 f the Persian Gulf from the dullness of the pearl-market, always seriously affected by the outbreak of War. Follow ing hard on the Wars between Turkey and Italy and in the Balkans, the oreat European War caused wide-spread distress even in this remote locality. ^ The War also affected this unfortunate tract in another way. Owin 0 * to the Government demand for transports, the British India Company were unable to serve the minor ports in the Persian Gulf as usual and Debai, the distributing port for the Trucial Coast, and Lingah, which, when Debai fails, takes its place, were both, perforce, neglected. As this Coast depends on these steamers for its supply of cereals, it was at one time gravely threatened by famine. If we add to this a severe storm that sank about 50 pearl-boats and drowned 100 divers, it can truly be said that these Arabs have been afflicted, in the course of 1914, with every species of disaster that could possibly overtake them. Conditions are now slightly improved. Plague is no longer reported ; the Company has resumed its normal sailings, but it will be long before the Coast recovers. Shaikh Salim bin Sultan proposed, in March, to fit out an expedition by Ras-ei-Khaimah. f a the pagers of Shaam, whom he alleged to be refractory to his orders. His proposals were supported by the Eesidency Agent but both the Shaikh and the Agent were informed by the Acting Eesident that such expeditions were a breach of the Truce and could not be tolerated. The Shaikh was directed to bring his grievances to the notice of the Political Eesident when next on tour on the Trucial Coast. Nothing further has been heard on the subject. This Shaikh has not yet been recognised as independent of Shargah but the change in the succession to that Shaikhdom has certainly established his position more firmly than ever. Last year it was foreshadowed that it would probably be necessary to i T , rr • • coerce Shaikh Eashid bin Ahmed. The Umm-al-Kaiwain. .. ^ , sanction oi Government was received and this painful duty was carried out, on the 18th March, by H. M. S. 'Fox,' ^Dartmouth,' and 'Odin.' The recalcitrant Shaikh was quickly brought to reason and paid Es 10,000 in settlement of his brother's claims against him and a fine of Es. 15,000 to Government for his contumacy. Ajman. Nothing to record. Shaikh Sagar bin Khalid died of plague on the 18th April. He was succeeded by his cousin Shaikh Khalid shaigal1 ' bin Ahmed, appointed to the Shaikhdom by the late Shaikh just before his death. Owing to the general upset of the War, it has not yet been possible to convey the formal confirmation by the Government of India of this Shaikh's accession in the usual way. Once during the year, Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid repeated the old cry that the Amir of Nejd was likely to threaten the independence of Oman. As he used this to support an application for a pass to purchase ammunition from Maskat, it does not seem that it was seriously meant. There is not a shred of reliable evidence to show that the Amir ever gave the Trucial Chiefs a thought this year62 PERSIAN GrTJIiF ADMINISTRATION REPORT It is perhaps well to place on record that, in August of this year, His Highness the Sultan of Maskat wrote to DebaL Shaikh Said bin Mukhtum raising an obiection to the occupation by the Bani Yas of the village of Hajazain in the Waddi Hatta. As a precaution, the Acting Eesident addressed His Highness requesting him to acquaint the Eesidency with the particulars of the Maskat claim. To this no reply has been received, probably because it was difficult to frame one. S. G. KNOX, Lieutenant-Colonel, On special duty in the absence of the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf.

Shaikh Isa enjoyed good health throughout the year except for one bout of fever from which he quickly recovered. He is still very hale in spite of his age and frequently goes on long hawking expeditions with his sons. Shaikh Hamad bin Muhammad caused some trouble by refusing to allow one of his servants to obey a summons from Shaikh Isa, and appealed to the Political Eesident. Shaikh Isa was very grateful for the support given to him. Shaikh Ali bin Ahmed, whose exile to India had a good effect for some years, also began to give trouble by his tyrannical conduct. On being severely taken to task by Shaikh Isa on the Political Agent's advice he speedily amended his ways. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa rendered great assistance to the Agency throughout the year. Assistant Surgeon G. K. Manani was in charge throughout the year, and ., „ , did very useful work. The figures as com- Victona Memorial Hospital. , , ,, , . 0 pared with the two previous years are as follows:— Year. In-door. Out-door.

The Agency Guard was furnished throughout the year by the 95th Eussell's Infantry. A s3poy committed suicide.

He has tried a large number Local officials. ^ Political Agent's request with justice and despatch ; and the good order maintained in Manama is largely due to his influence. His attitude during the War with Turkey is noted below. Kazi Shaikh Khalaf, the Shiah Kazi, is still venal and dilatory. Muhammad bin Fadhal, Salifah Judge, has been prompt and just in his decisions. Khalifah bin Mubarak, Judge of the Marine Court, has given satisfaction in the few cases sent to him. Ali bin Husam, the Amir of Manama, though extremely corrupt, has served the Agency much better than former Amirs and there have been no complaints of his conduct in cases in which foreigners have been concerned. The Agency has much less to do with Pahadbin Abdur Rahman, Amir of Muharrak. What work he has to do for us has been well done. The Eadawis supplied by the Amirs for the Agency Court have worked extremely well. One hundred and eightyieight cases were tried with the assistance of the Majlis during the year. Most of these were in connection with the estates of deceased persons, absconders and bankrupts. This work is generally arduous and complicated, but the results have been, as a rule, good though slow. The Majlis has been relieved of a great deal of work by sending suits to arbitrators not necessarily members of that body. The judicial work in 1914 was very heavy, especially during the Summer. In August as many as 235 civil and 46 criminal cases were instituted. The totals for the year were 1,484 and 382, respectively, as against 787 and 355 in 1913, 518 and 203 in 1912 and 803 and 211 in 1911. One thousand two hundred and fourteen civil suits were heard by the Political Agent without the assistance of the Majlis, Kazi, or Marine Courts. Eorty-two were pending at the end of the year, of which 33 are before the Majlis. Six hun dred and seventy-nine suits were settled by consent and 653 decrees were given.FOR THE TEAR 19K 55 The Vernacular office establishment consists of i clerk and one daftri, none of whom has any Soial ?^inin ^A to all the judicial work and ordinary vernacular work thev'havp W1 ^ with 69 estates, make out 1,391 passports and vise aLat L V 0 d l al understood that the Vernacular office is understaffed Great ^ f o,ded b, iurtitution of p.ti.i.r first, but the people have now become used to it.

The actual avengers were not discovered but blood money was paid by the community concerned. The chief offenders have, as usual, been Turkish subjects from Basrah and Kurdistan. No serious offences were committed by them during the year; and the figures, a total of 382 cases, give an exaggerated idea of the crime' committed, as they are swollen by the quarrelsome habits of the Persian com munity, a slanging match and a torn shirt figuring as ' abuse ' and ' assault.' These two heads account for 39 and 169 cases, respectively, but litigation of this sort is now severely discouraged. There were 75 cases of theft, 58 offences against local laws, and 28 marital disputes. More than half, or 245 cases, were dismissed or compromised, while 24) persons were imprisoned and 35 fined. Eorty-one persons were repatriated to Basrah, 20 to Persian ports, 2 to Karachi and 6 to the Arabian coast during the year. The majority of foreign malefactors having been got rid of, criminal cases dropped from 57 in June to 1 in December. ^ The latter case being that of a Turk who was deported to Basrah, and there, having been impressed into the Turkish Army, deserted with his rifle and ammunition which he handed over to Shaikh Mubarak in Kuwait. He then returned to Bahrain, and within a week was again caught stealing. There were only 15 cases in which Indians were accused, and all of these, with the exception of 2 were dismissed or compromised.

The administration of Hassa and Katif has been greatly improved, and irrigation is being extended.56 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Owing to the inhabitants of Katif having other sources of livelihood than pearling, the distress prevalent elsewhere on this coast is not yet being severely felt in those districts. Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim bin Thani has been experiencing considerable difficulty with the sons of Shaikh Ahmed Katr - bin Thani and with his elder brother. Shaikh Khalifah. He cannot be said to have consolidated his power since his father's death last year. He has preserved a friendly attitude since the com mencement of the War. It was announced in the public press at the beginning of the year that the Porte had abandoned all claims to suzerainty over Katr. The treaty was not, however, ratified and the Turkish garrison is still at Doha. Katr, owing to its possessing no resources but the pearl fisheries, is feeling economic condi tions very severely. Shaikh Abdulla has never attempted to assist Bahrain merchants in collecting their debts, and consequently no credit is now given to Katr, and supplies are running low.

The maximum temperature for the vear registered on August 2nd was 10i o , though the wet bulb frequently showed 88° and over at 8 a.m. The lowest temperature for the year, 52°, was reo-istered on January 3rd. &amp; No rain, except for one slight shower, fell till the middle of November, but from then on there was considerable precipitation. The usual summer « Shamal ' or north wind was stronger than usual and lasted from June into August. A cyclonic storm, fortunately of short duration, did considerable damage to buildings and shipping in November. Bahrain was ill-prepared for a bad season in 1914. The year before last Pearl Trade. about a million and a quarter sterling was brought into the islands by the sale of an excellent catch at high prices but the boom was not maintained in 1913, as the Manager of Messrs. Rosenthal, in an effort to corner the market, paid such high prices that the dealers were dazzled and declined to sell at'more reasonable rates to the other European buyers. The Bombay merchants who had sufficient pearls in stock merely watched the market, and consequently at the commencement of this season the Arab merchants who were moreover somewhat demoralised by their success of 1912, and in a weak position from the small sales of 1913, started with large stocks in hand. The early part of the season was chiefly spent in manoeuvring, and, before serious buying had commenced, rumours of the impending War in Europe reached Bahrain. Only some £60,000 had been spent in Bahrain itself and a negligible sum on the rest of the pearl banks. The larger part of this, too, had fallen to the share of the Hindu Baniahs, who so largely contribute to the financing of the trade, and the Arab merchants secured but little. By the time the stream had descended through the Nakhudas to the divers it had become extremely exiguous, while practically nothing reached the petty traders who, during the off season, feed and clothe the divers and their dependants on credit. Several of these had not been able to survive the poor season of 1913, and many had gone bankrupt before rumours of War cut off the stream for good. When War was declared the whole fleet was celebrating Eamzan with the usual extravagance, The sudden drying up of credit caused something of a panic, and a certain amount of difficulty was experienced in financing the fleet for the second fishing, but the temporary prohibition of the export of food-stuffs and the fixing of prices allayed this, and in the end practicaljy all the boats started for the banks. While the financing of the fleet hung in the balance it seemed as if Bahrain was in for a period of very serious distress immediately, but Shaikh Isa rose to his responsibilities, and the closing of the Shatt-el-j^rab, and the consequent inability of a very large number of the riverain divers, who had gone to their homes for Eamzan, to return to Bahrain largely reduced the numbers of divers for whom provision would have had to be made. The divers from Hassa also, who, unlike those from the rest of the Arab Coast, have other sources of employment, were ^ several hundred short at the commencement of the second fishing. The British India Steam Navigation Company generously reduced their fares from Bahrain for two months after the closing of the second fishing. Some 600 of these cheap passages rwere granted, and Shaikh Isa advised all Nakhudas to advance sufficient money to their foreign divers to enable them to go elsewhere to seekgg PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION EEPOET SS /ClThiTdSme bmdKr^diSr'S'i' SSl,'taS started ' The S^.'

The Germans, since the Bahnson episode, were very unpopular with the Bahr- i 'unis, while France, as the centre of the pearl trade of the world, bulked much larger in their eyes. At the beginning the universal des^e except among the Persian merchants, was that Germany should be speedily and cheaply crushed, and the world be at liberty to buy pearls again., Babmn ^ntnbuted nearly Rs. 14,000 to various British Belief Funds, out of which the Shaikh and his lamily gave Bs. 9,600. Unfortunately no British telegrams had been received lor over a fortnight when, in the beginning of September, German telegrams be^an to arrive from Basrah and Bushire in native boats The most was naturally made of the British retirement to the Seine, and belief in our invin cibility was shaken. Germany then became the favourite, and the German tales of British reverses, further embroidered in the bazaar, were hailed wit ^ delight. One of the Shaikhs even called his favourite hawk Gmlliaume after the German Emperor. When Turkey first came upon the scene the purport of the German « news ' was that Bussia was Germany s one dan- irerous opponent, and that she, the arch-enemy of Islam, was meditating the conquest of Stambul. From now on the British shared the Muhammadans hatred for Russia* , On October 23rd a portion of the Indian Expeditionary Porce arrived off Bahrain, where the troops remained for nine days without disembarking, i e attitude of the Shaikh and his family was perfectly loyal, but the common people and even a number of the merchants were much disturbed ; ana w^ en hostilities broke out with Turkey, there was a certain amount ot religious feeling displayed.

The Customs management throughout the year has been excellent The inconvenient practice of allowing goods to be released on bond without Customs. production of a delivery order furnished to the Consignees by the Steamer s Agents which has occasioned so much trouble in the past both in Kuwait and elsewhere has ceased, and no complaints of importance have been made against the Director or his subordinates at any time. Labour prices are high in Kuwait in comparison with certain other places in the Persian Gulf, this is due mainly to the necessity of employing imported labour in view of the disinclination or inability of the local people to work satis factorily. The investigations of Mr. Pascoe in connection with well borings which were mentioned in last year's report having resulted in such a scheme being Water Supply. abandoned, that of the institution of a {condensing plant was taken up and arrangements have been concluded for its early establishment. The work is to be undertaken by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Government of India have advanced the necessary funds to the Shaikh without interest, to be repaid in instalments from the sums accruing from the sale of water. It is hoped that an ample supply of good drinking water will now be always available at a cheaper rate than that at which the &amp;hatt-el-Arab river supplies are at present disposed of. Should funds admit improvements in the direction of distribution in the town will be introduced later. Postal arrangements have on the whole been satisfactory throughout the year, but the delay in ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention, Posts ana Telegraphs. and subsequently [the outbreak of War, caused the suspension 01 the arrange ments regarding the long hoped for Kuwait Post Offices. Its institution is now imminent however, as is believed to be that of a wireless telegraphy station in the port. The anniversary of the birthday of His Majesty the King-Emperor was celebrated as usual on June 22nd. Alms were distributed to the poor and Celebrations a rece pti 011 was bold by the Political e e ra 10US ' Agent in the evening which was largely attended. On the Muhammadan feast days the Political Agent paid congratulatory visits to the Shaikh, his relations, and many of the principal inhabitants. i 260 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT As already intimated the pearl season has not done much for the community, although the second visit to the hanks met with some success. It was evident by August, when War Pearl Fishery. broke out, that sales would he difficult if not impossible at present, and a small portion only of the results of the fishery of 1913 have as yet been disposed of. Present conditions are hard on those who are forced to sell at what price they can get. Advances this year were made at E70 and E30-50 to each diver and puller respectively at the first visit to the banks in June and were as low as E15 and E10 at the second visit in September. The absence of serious crime under the Shaikh's administration continues to be a striking feature. Occasional robberies have taken place in the town during the year, which have invariably Law and Crime. been discovered and the culprits severely dealt with. The health of the Kuwait community has been very good during 1914, no epidemic having occurred. Quarantine arrangements were carried out with out a hitch, passengers being detained Public Health. | n j^ats as hitherto, which arrangement is sufficient so long as the periods of detention are limited to a day or two. In April one of these boats unfortunately capsized in a sudden squall, with the result that eight lives were lost. The Agency Dispensary was open throughout the year and 8,436 patients were treated.

The relations between Sir Mubarak bin Sub ah and his Political Agent have been most cordial throughout u the year. He has accepted the advice of _ ^ „ u .. His Majesty's Government in every • Shaikh s Personal Relations. . , • -i • i 1 i no S instance m which it has been offered, and has done everything in his power to shew appreciation of their friendship and support. In the difficult circumstances resulting from the outbreak of War with Germany, and later with Turkey, his unfailing loyalty has been of the greatest assistance, not only in his own territories but also in connection with the powerful tribes outside who look up to 'him as patron. Sir Mubarak has renounced all connection with the Porte and has been denounced by Turkish officials as a traitor. The K.O.S.I. was conferred upon him on the occasion of His Majesty's birthday. His Excellency's relations with Sir Khazal Khan of Mohammerah are as cordial as ever, but owing to the War they have not exchanged so many visits as usual during the year under review. The medical work carried on by the American Mission is greatly appreciated by the Shaikh, and his people are availing themselves /2^ ^ -'Aiabiwa Mission. of its advantages more and more as ^ progresses. In February the Shaikh jJrepented to the Mission free of charge a piece of ground in addition to that which they had previously purchased from him; and the new hospital having been built during the year was opened recently at a special visit paid by His Excellency for the purpose.

He nevertheless held out for his rights at the conference, and no agreement resulted, but subsequently being presented with an offer of more generous terms, and being assured moreover that some of them would not be enforced, he consented to a settlement, the exact details of which have not yet come to light. J Unfortunately this agreement led to some coldness between 'Sir Mubarak and^ Bin Saud with the result that correspondence between them on the subject of Bin Saud's position ceased for a time. The Amir considered that Sir Mubarak had led him to entertain vain hopes and then deserted bim at a critical moment, and the Shaikh held that Bin Saud had deceived him by coming to an agreement with Turkey without first consulting him. The majority of the terms of the agreement were certainly never carried into effect whatever they may have been, and Bin Saud's regard for His Majesty's Government was fortunately not affected by his disappointment at not receiving the support for which he had hoped. Upon the outbreak of War with Germany he shewed at once that his sympathies were with us. By October the probability of the Turks making common cause wilh Germany and the prospect of an opportunity finally to sever his connection with the Ports still further enticed him to throw in his lot with the British Government, and from this time he resolutely declined repeated requests for help which came from Constantinople. When War between England and Turkey became62 persian gtjlr administration report por the year 1914. imminent and it was decided to depute Captain Shakespear as Political Officer with him the Amir undertook to receive him with the friendship and cor- diaUty which had characterised their former relations Captain Shakespear airived at Kuwait towards the end of Noyember and left on 13th December to ioin Bin Saud in the interior. ^ Various Shaikhs have visited the Political Agent from time to time during the year as usual.
