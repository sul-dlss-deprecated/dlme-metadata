You v/ill have seer our official letter v reference S.35888/S.6. dated 4th March, dealing with the gift to the Afghans of the 9 replacement engines at Kabul. According to our Equipment Branch 32 engines in all have been supplied, 20 with the Hinds, and 12 subsequently to replace defective and worn-out engines. They are now asking for the numbers of the nine engines which have been provided as a gift, to be obtained from Kabul for record purposes, and also v/ish to know the whereabouts of the remaining three.

India CoFfice kinutes on Air Ministry Letter JNo. S.35888/Part V/S.6. of 4th March. Proposed gift to Afghan Government of 9 Aircraft Engines that have failed and have had to be replaced This has been discussed with Mr.W.J.M.Mackenzie of the Air Ministry. It was agreed that we could go ahead with letting the Afghans have the rejected engines. As regards the middle sentence of^the Air Ministry's letter, the Air Ministry appeared to be somewhat confused as to the financial position, i.e. who pays for the replacements* of engines carried out. It was explained that the position as we saw it was that the Air Ministry paid (actually they have paid already) but that H.M.G. (the Air Ministry) in consultation with the Government of India might later decide to use anything left over from the 'surplus proceeds' to compensate themselves to some extent for the loss involved. Mr. Mackenzie seemed to think the Government of India might in some way be partly responsible for the misunderstanding over 'flying hours', but it was explained to him that in so far as the Air Ministry (and R.A.F.) were not wholly responsible, the Minister at Kabul was the only person who could be brought to book (of course in our view he was not to blame in the matter); at any rate the Government of India had nothing to do with the mistake, and their financial authorities would certainly not accept any responsibility. It was agreed that the India Office would consider pieparing a demi-official memorandum explainingthe whole financial position under the scheme agreed between the Air Ministry, India Office snd the Government of India.

XXX Received 23,45 houra, 23rd December, 1939 2484^. Addressed to Secretary of State for India repeated to Kabul No. 441, As you know the Afghan Government are not entirely satisfied with the deal connected with sale of second-hand Hind aircraft. This is due to failure of a number of Kestrel V engines shortly after delivery, Failures were due to water leaks and Afghan Air Force has no depot facilities for major over-hauls. All defective engines have been replaced except four which Air Ministry telegraphed on December 9th would be despatched at the earliest opportunity. 2. Prom a political point of view it is Important that final outcome of this deal should be as satisfactory as possible. It ie recommended that to complete deal His Majesty's Government should make the /Afghans a free gift of engines which have failed after arrival in Kabul and have had to be replaced. This will be no serious loss to Royal Air Force as to return these engines from Kabul to the nearest depot where they can be repaired (we have not the necessary equipment here) will be slow and costly. On the other hand the engines will be of great value to the Afghans for spares and instructional purposes. If this proposal is accepted the Afghan Government will, it is considered, have been given a very fair deal and when the additional four engines have arrived it is proposed to ask His Majesty's Minister to infomn them that we regard our liabilities as having been fully discharged.

I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Secret ary, Political Department, India Office. No. 101., dated the 4th November, 1939. RECd.POL.DEPt. - 6 DEC 1939 INDIA OFFICE ■«. 'Util —1Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to the Foreign Office, No. 101, DATEf) the 4th November 1939. I have the honour to forward as an enclosure to this despatch a report from the Military Attache to this Legation on the present position of the supply of aircraft and accessories to the Afghan Government under the terms of the agree ment arrived at last spring. 2. It will be seen that out of the total of 20 engines supplied from Egypt there still remain seven in an unserviceable condition, and that a proportion of the armaments and all the wireless and photographic equipment have not yet arrived. I fully realise that in war time the supply of these engines and equip ment may present difficulties, but I trust that it may be found possible to com plete the order within a reasonable time. Until the engines have been delivered and the price of the accessories is known it wall not be possible to complete the contract forwarded with Mr. Crombie’s letter P.Z. 4814j39, dated the 30th August 1939. 3. It must I fear be acknowledged that this transaction has not enhanced British reputation in this country for punctual and satisfactory business methods. It is of course obvious that the Afghans could not expect to receive machines in first class condition for the price they paid, but the persistence of water leaks in the engines as delivered suggests, to the lay mind, either that there was some undue strain thrown on them between the time they left Egypt and the time they were delivered in Kabul, or that their condition at the time of sale did not wholly correspond to the Air Ministry’s definition of machines as ‘ in fully serviceable condition and maintained up to highest British standards see Forminka-90 of the 21st December 1938. The Afghan authorities have on the whole accepted the position in a reasonable manner, and their somewhat critical attitude at the outset largely disappeared on hearing that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to replace defective engines as soon as possible. They have manifested their willingness to accept the bargain by paying without demur £16,000, approximately one-third of the purchase price, as soon as it was demanded from them, but I do not think they are likely to repeat the experiment of buying second hand aircraft in future. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India. Letter from the Military Attache, British Legation, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, No. 1117, dated the 4th November 1939. I have the honour to report that three Hawker Hind aircraft, completing delivery of the twenty machines ordered this year by the Afghan Government, arrived at Kabul on 18th October. This is a suitable opportunity to review the progress made in completing this order which in addition to the aircraft includes a number of items such as bombs, small arms ammunition, photographic and wireless equipment. As a number of the engines of the aircraft supplied have not proved satis factory I also include in this review certain details regarding their replacement and a report on their condition prepared by Mr. Robinson, the Rolls Royce* engineer attached to the Afghan Air Force. 2. The original order which was placed in February of this year was for :— (a) 20 Hawker Hind aircraft fitted with guns and electro-magnetic bomb release gear. Aircraft second hand but fully serviceable. (b) Air frame and engine spares for the above aircraft. (c) Ten Irving pilot, and ten Irving observer parachutes. id) Armament as shown in Appendix “ A ”. (e) Wireless equipment as shown in Appendix “ B (f) Photographic equipment as shown in Appendix “ C ”. 3. Twenty Hawker Hind Aircraft. —It was originally intended that these aircraft should arrive in two batches of ten each. Owing to various mishaps, however, (here were eventually three separate deliveries.

In my opinion the consistent defect in these six engines which in each case was either an internal or external water leak was caused by one or a combination of the following :— (a) After a top or complete overhaul, or in any case where the cylinder block has been removed, maintenance staff have failed to check the block for tightness after initial running in. (b) Pilots have run the engines at excessive boost for long pieriods instead of observing the minus boost limit laid down by the maker’s. (c) Engines have not been run at constant water temperatures either by ground or air staffs. Reason (a) abov^e is in my opinion the most likely explanation of failure. No overhauls have been carried out in Kabul on any of these engines. The small number of hpurs flown at Kabul is unlikely to have caused damage as explained in reason (&amp;). Whilst at Kabul no engines have been misused as explained in reason (c). D. W. R, ROBINSON, Rolls Royce Representative.v 6 APPENDIX “ E Suggested list of additional tools required for serving tux&gt; hind squadrons at Kabul prepared by Mr. Bobinson, Bolls Boyce Engineer with the Afghan Air Force. i 1. The original batch of Hind aircraft delivered by Messrs. Hawkers arrived with a full engine tool kit per machine, i.e., 8 tool kits. 2. The R. A. F. hatch of Hind aircraft only included 5 engine tool kits. Th'o total number of tool kits therefore available for servicing 26 aircraft is 13. Eight additional engine tool kits are therefore required as a minimum, since several aircraft are in reserve. 3. A set of the following miscellaneous tools for each Hind Squadron is also required :— 1 set flat spanners. 1 set box spanners. 1 large screw driver. 1 small screw driver. 1 pair large pliers. 1 pair small pliers. 1 set of feeler gauges. 1 tappet spanner. 1 set of C spanners. 1 tuning key. 1 B. T. H. magneto spanner. 1 Watford magneto spanner. 4. It is to be noted that the tool kits which have arrived witih.the R. A.

Dear We have just heard from our Equipment Branch that the radio set which has been ordered for the Afghans is now out of production and has been superseded by another type. The set originally ordered was designated A.D.37 - H.E.D.X/5872B, and the new type is A.D. 77A/6872B, which, v/e are informed by the Marconi Company, can be satisfactorily fitted into the Hind. We have also been informed that the cameras which are on order will, in all probability, not be supplied until December. Do you v/ant to be informed by an official letter of these changed circumstances, or will this be sufficient for you to enquire if the Afghans will take the new radio equipment? In view of the length of time involved before the Afghans can be supplied, do you think there is a possibility of the contract for the aircr ft being signed, and leaving out the cameras and radio, which can afterwards be supplied as a separate item ?

Please see the Government of India’s telegram of 8 th September below. 20 Hind aircraft have been sold to the Afghan Government in two consignments. The second consignment was delivered to the Afghan Government at the end of August but owing to the unsatisfactory state of the engines/the Afghans have in fact received up to date only 17 machines instead of 20. It appears that one of the machines belonging to the first consignment delivered in May is still at Peshawar, where it developed a water leak in the engine,while two aircraft of the second batch are still at Karachi, where their engines are being replaced with overhauled engines prior to delivery to the Afghan Government (see Government of India’s telegram of 4th September at P.Z.5461). It will be remembered that,in view of the unsatisfactory state of some of the engines in the first batch of aircraft, H.M.G. and the Government of India agreed that the Afghan Government should be informed that payment by them of the first instalment of the purchase price might be deferred until the second consignment of aircraft had been delivered (see para.4 of Forminka telegram No.49 of 18th July at P.Z.4370). In the circumstances I think thst the Afghan Government ore entitled to expect full delivery of the 20 aircraft before they are asked to pay. Incidentally we have proceeded on this assumption in drawing up the revised draft agreement with the Afghan Government confirming the contract which * ha.f not yet been signed (P. Z. 4814/39). In any casj|^.t seems somewhat strange that at a time when the Government of India state that they are considering the question of a/ (6610) Wt.25956/235 nfcOOO 9/38 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

The overhauled engines supplied by the R.A.F. have already arrived at Karachi for installing in the two aircraft which have been held up at that place, and it is pernaps not too optimistic to hope that the third engine (for the machine still at Peshawar) will arrive in India during agreed between H.M.G. and the Government of India, the Government of India are paying H.M.G. in respect of these 20 Hind aircraft, but it is not essential that they should pay until towards the end of the present financial year (March 1940). It does not appear, therefore, that the Government of India will be seriously embarrasBed from the financial point of view if payment of the first instalment by the Afghan Government to the Government of India is a little longer delayed. A draft telegram to the Minister at Kabul, repeated to the Government of India, is suggested. the next month or so. Under ——Draft Paper. POLITICAL DRAFT TiLLGRAM Department. P.

I am quite clear in the result that no share of the blame can fairly or properly be assigned to the Indian authorities. The misunderstanding itself arose entirely in Kabul, and the Government of India knew nothing about it until the harm had been done. And the phrase in the telegram from H.Q. Middle East to the *ir Ministry which gave rise to the misunderstanding was so worded that any ordinary person would naturally put on it the interpretation put on it in fact by Fraser-Tytler and dithers at Kabul. When, however, the Afghan Government hav&lt; paid their last instalment of the price of the aircraft, we will consider the possibility of using any surplus balance which may then accrue for the purpose of compensating the Air Ministry for the extra expenditure incurred by them as suggested in your telegram 1200 of the 18th July. The cost of transport of aircraft to Kabul and the salaries of such Air Instructors as may be requiredare of course part of the original transaction and will form a first charge on the receipts from the Afghan Government.GLR.

The following points may be noted (a) All the engines which are being replaced and also the second batch of aircraft should have arrived at Kabul about the end of this month (see Katodon 64 of 24th July). This necessitates amendment to paragraph 2(a) of the original draft and I think that paragraph 3(a) can now be deleted. ('b) Paragraph 2(a)(ii) of the revised draft. The Air Ministry have agreed in effect to replace any engine of any of the 20 Hinds which have less than 300 hours to run before overhaul. (J. &lt; 5 .

Gp.685 (8651) Wt.40880/22 10,000 1/39 27 M 19%' Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the Government of India's telegram No.969 of 17th July, 1939, a copy of which is enclosed herewith for easy reference, on the subject of payment for the Hind aircraft which are being supplied by the Air Ministry to the Afghan Government through the Government of India. 2. It will be/remembered that in their telegram No.4fC of 13th March, 1939, a copy of which was enclosed in India Office letter No.PZ.1567/39 of 14th March, the Government of India undertook that, irrespective of any risk of Afghan default, the total sum involved in respect of aircraft and accessories actually supplied to the Afghan Government would be paid to His Majesty's Government before the end of the financial year, 1939- 40 provided that (a) it did not exceed £39,000, and (b) if the Afghans failed to pay cash on delivery of the first instalment of ten aircraft, the second instalment would not be delivered to them and no charge would be made to the Government of India on its account.3. As a result of the unsatisfactory condition of some of the aircraft already supplied by His Majesty’s Government, for which the Government of India were not in any way responsible, it recently became necessary to take certain steps with a view to dispelling any reasonable grounds for dissatisfaction on the part of the Afghan Government in regard to the quality of these aircraft. His Majesty's Minister, Kabul, recommended, inter alia, in paragraph 8 of his telegram of 18th June, a copy of which was enclosed in India Office letter No.PZ.3844/39 of 21st June, that the Afghan Government should be informed that payment by them of the first instalment of the purchase price would be deferred until, the second batch of machines had been delivered, and the Government of India agreedto this proposal in paragraph 3 ( 3 ) of their telegram of 26th June, a copy of which was enclosed in India Office letter No.PZ.3984/39 of 27th June. The effect of this concession wnich it hajJ been necessary to make on political grounds, and to which the Air Council agreed in paragraph 5 of Air Ministry letter No.S.35888/lv/s.6 of 14th July, 1939, is that under the existing arrangements agreed as between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, the latter have incurred a contingent liability in the event of‘ an Afghan default for n t+v^o LDraft Paper. Department. 3. expenditure during the financial year 1939-40 in excess of the financial liability which they previously agreed to undertake in their telegxam of 13th March. The Secretary of State, therefore, feels that in the event of an Afghan default in payments to the Government of India during the present financial year, it would be equitable that the Government of India's liability for payment to the Air Ministry during the same period (estimated at £38,GOOJ snould be reduced by an Un amount to the sum represented by any such default. It is understood that the Afghan Government made a definite offer to pay for the aircraft and accessories in three equal annual instalments (each instalment estimated at about £16,000) though the Afghan Prime Minister undertook, if possible, to pay in two annual instalments of about £24,000 each. In this connection, reference is invited to paragraph 3 of Gobn^L telegram No.24 of 16th March, 1939, a copy of which was enclosed in India office letter No.PZ.1656/39 of 17th jviarch.

Minute Paper political (External) Department Please see the submission at P.Z.3984/39 The Air Ministry have now sent us an official reply to our letter of 29th June and on the vtfiole the Air Ministry,^P.Z.4370) may be regarded as satisfactory. They have evidently gone to some trouble to meet our vie vs and in some respects their proposals are actually more generous to the Afghan Government than what we requested them to do. 2. As regards the first batch of 10 machines already delivered to the Afghans the Air Ministry are willing to replace with newly overhauled engines any engines which have less than 300 hours flying time to run before overhaul. This proposal goes somewhat further than we asked (see ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the desiderata stated in our letter at Flag A) and it is understood that it will involve altogeftier the supply of six newly overhauled engines. 3. With regard to the second batch of ten machines due for delivery this month, the Air Ministry say that they are not prepared to negotiate on the basis of 500 hours flying time (see item (3) of our desiderata at Flag A) and point out that the maximum period that an engine of this type (Kestrel) is allowed to run between overhauls is 480 hours only. They state however that six out of the ten engines in this batch of machines (which I understand have already been shipped from Egypt on 6 th July) will have at least 400 hours, and another 2 over 300 hours to run before overhaul, while they have undertaken to supply 2 newly overhauled engines to replace the remaining two which have less than this amount of time to run. It will be seen letter that/ (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 (8650) Wt.40880/22 10,000 1/392 that the above, which is based on information informally supplied, does not tally exactly with the figures given in paragraph 4 of the Air Ministry letter, since the Air Ministry have discovered since writing their letter that only 6 instead of 8 of these engines will have over 400 hours to run. 4* The Air Ministry proposals are based on the assumption that it is fair to expect the Afghan Government to accept engines which have a minimum of 300 hours to run before overhaul though it will be seen that in fact, when all the engineswhich it is now proposed to overhaul have been supplied, 14 out of a total of 20 engines will have at least 400 hours to run before overhaul (i.e. 8 newly overhauled engines plus 6 in the second batch which already have over 400 hours left to run). On the whole this seems quite reasonable and it is to be hoped that the Minister at Kabul will be able to persuade the Afghan Government that this is so* If the Afghan Government are not willing to accept this solution, the Air Ministry would be prepared in the last resort to replace or overhaul free of charge any engine which at the time of delivery had less than 400 hours to run, as soon as any such engine had completed a total of 480 hours running. It has been ascertained from the Air Ministry that this latter undertaking on their part would apply to the first as well as to the second batch of aeroplanes. It would ultimately involve replacing or overhauling an additional 6 engines. 5 f The last paragraph of the Air Ministry letter suggests at first sight that they do not agree with the Government of India that the latter should not be called upon to incur extra expenditure out of their own resources on account of the present proposals, but I gather that the paragraph is based on a misunde r s t anding/Minute Paper Department A \ 3. misunderstaading of the position. The Air Ministry appear to have assumed that if and when the Afghan Government paid overi in 194l) the last instalment of the purchase price of the aircraft, any 'surplus proceeds' of the sale would go into the Government of India’s own pocket and form part and parcel of their Afghan Fund. This has never heen our intention. Whoever is responsible for the fact that the aircraft already supplied hardly came up to the reasonable expectations of the Afghan Government, the Government of India is entirely blameless in the matter and cannot be expected to undertake any additional financial liability on account of what has occurred. I understand that the Air Ministry will probably be quite prepared to concur in the attached draft telegram to the Government of India on this point. 6 .

V 1 } &lt;jL* ‘ - 2. I am to state that, while the Air Council cannot accept the Government of India f s view as to the responsibility for this misunderstanding, they appreciate the political considera tions involved, and agree with Lord Zetland that steps should be taken immediately to ensure that the Afghan Government should not be allowed to feel that they have been unfairly treated by His Majesty’s Government in this matter. the 3. With this end in view the Council have already taken following action (i) Two overhauled engines to replace failures' in the first batch of aircraft left Headquarters, Middle East on the 6 th July. x (ii) The Governme nt of Indi a have been asked to state how many more engines require replacement on the basis that each engine supplied should have a minimum life of 300 hours to run before overhaul. On' receipt of this information The Under-Secretary of State, Political Department, India Office, King Charles Street, S. W. 1. ItECo. POL. DEPt. 1 5JULVJ39 INDIA OFFICEsteps will be taken to supply overhauled engines in replacement of any which have less than 300 hours to run. 4. With reference to the second batch of 10 aircraft which are to be delivered in the near future to the Afghan Government, I am to state that eight of the engines in these aircraft will have at least 400 hours to run, end that nonewill have less than 300 hours to run before overhaul. Since the X maximum period that an engine of this type is allowed to run between overhauls is 480 hours, the Council are not prepared to accept 500 hours as a basis of negotiation, but are of the opinion that provided an engine has a minimum of 300 hours to run before becoming due for overhaul it should be considered r acceptable. If, however, the Afghan Government are not prepared to agree to this, the Council are willing that they should be informed that any engine which, when delivered, has less than 400 hours to run before overhaul, will be either replaced or overhauled free of charge as soon as it has completed a total of 480 hours running. I am to point out, however, that this latter proposal offers more than the Council would be prepared to consider in normal circumstances, and that if the Afghan Government are prepared to accept engines with a minimum of 300 hours to run, as suggested above, the Council would prefer that negotiations should be carried out on this basis. 5. The Council agree that the position should be explained to the Afghan authorities, who should be informed that the short time allowed for delivery did not permit of overhaul before the first batch of aircraft was sent. The Council agree that the Afghan Government should be permitted to defer payment of the first instalment of the purchase money until the delivery of the second batch of aeroplanes. 6 . With regard to the financial aspect of this matter I am&amp;A 1 to say that the Council cannot accept the Government of India’s view that no part of the additional expenditure should 3 be borne by their Fund. In this connexion they have taken note of the suggestion in your letter that Lord Zetland will be prepared to consider the question of using any surplus balance which may remain in the hands of the Government of India after the completion of the transection for the purpose of reihndLng to His Majesty’s Government the cost of the spare engines now required. The Council agree, however, that financial considera tions should not be allowed to delay the action proposed in paragraphs 3-5 above.

I an: extreneiy grateful for the personal interest which you have taken in this matter, fie shall of course have to put the proposals contained in your letter to our Minister at Kabul, and ascertain the Afghan Government*s reactions, but, ©ubject to his views and those of the Government of India, I should hope that they will lonn the basis for a satisfactory settlement of the case. Yours v. sincerely, Z. The Kt.Hon. Sir Kingsley flood, M.P.Draft Paper. Department./ I have as you requested in your letter of the 29th June looked personally into the matter of the sale of dO Hmd aircraft to the Afghan Government, and I quite agree that it is very necessary to counteract the had impression which the failure of some of the engines has created without delay. ' ith this end in view we have already sent from Middle East two overhauled engines to replace failures in the first hatch. In addition we have asked the Indian authorities how many more engines require replacement on the basis that each engine supplied should have a minimum life of 300 hours to run before overhaul, and overhauled engines will he supplied to replace any which have less than this period to run. In the second hatch of 10 machines eight engines have 400 or more hours to run before overhaul, and only two have between 300 and 400 hours. As the maximum period allowed between overhauls for engines of this type is 480 hours, we do not feel able to accept the suggestion that the The Most Hon.The Marquess of Zetland,G.G.S.I., G.C.I.E., India Office, S.W.l.second ‘batch should he capable of 500 hours continuous flying, and we think the Afghans should be asked to accept engines which have a life of at least 500 hours before overhaul. If, however, they are not willing to agree to this proposal, we are prepared, as an exceptional measure, to replace or overhaul any which have less than 400 hours to run* This is, however, more than we should be prepared to offer in normal circumstances. I agree that the position should be explained to the Afghans on the lines you have suggested and also that they should be permitted to defer payment of the first instalment of the purchase price until the second batch of aircraft is delivered. The present position appears to be due to an incorrect deduction by the Indian authorities from tabular details of the first 10 aircraft supplied by Headquarters, Middle East. The allocation of responsibility for this misunderstanding is a matter for argument, but I do feel that the Indian authorities are not without their share of the blame, and I think there is probably every justification for pursuing the suggestion that any surplus accruing to them from this transaction should be offset against the expenditure which we are now incurring. As you say, however, the financial question can wait and we are going ahead with ouro INDIA OFFICE, « -ir&amp;hJ , «i» 15th July# 1^39 X c&amp;qIcSm herewith w fair or the / draft tolegrf&amp;k to Krbul revised s raoolt or our / t.iocuaaion yooterdoy of to moon* e ahoulu he glad if you could let us knou sfiiothor the Air Ministry concur in the drr t© to Kabul r.nd Ittdla ss they now stand# Perhaps it ©ill ho heat to (y it the lest sentence of the c roft to Kabul If there is any doubt ©bother the .£0 hour inspsctlom ware in feet carried out* 1 ora oenoin, to rial ford copies of this letter and of the revised dr®i t tele^rn' tu . abul# ing Coriiiander I.-.a*;v bry, D*S#C#, A*?*C.» Air Ministry, &gt; hi totn^Xl $ a*'. - • jl*INDIA OFFICE, / P.l.illu i?9 WHIT HALT.. 9 S.

Z. 3615. *Ve have now had the replies from the Minister at Kabul and from the Government of India to our telegrams of 12th June. It is now reported that yet another engine of the 10 already delivered has become unserviceable with cracked cylinders. Of the remaining seven, three are estimated to be good for 2 years, three for one year while the other will need overhaul within six months. In paragraphs 3 and 4 of his telegram, Sir Kerr Fraser Tytler deals with his negotiations with the Afghans. On the 13th February he gave the Foreign Minister an aide memoire containing the information supplied in paragraph 3 of Forminka 9 of the 8th February, namely ’’the condition of all aircraft is good and flying time of 20 air frames and engines estimated since they were new to date of release at end of March or at end of June averages 415 hours for air frames and 360 hours for engines”. On receipt of details by post he authorised the Military Attache' to inform the Afghan Air Commandant, if he raised the question, that the engines had been overhauled and had not since been flown. This, as he says, was undoubtedly the logical inference to be drawn from the wording of the telegram sent from R.A.F. Head quarters, Middle East (see paragraph 4(b) of Mr.Crombie’s minute at P.Z. 3618 and Air Ministry’s letter of the 31st January P.Z. 707/39). This telegram reported - (a) the number of flying hours done by each engine since new, and (b) the flying time since last overhaul. Under/Under (b) the entry was nil in each case. It certainly never occurred to us here any more than it did to Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytier that the explanation of this entry was that none of the engines had had an overhaul at all. In view of a tendency on the part of.the Air Ministry and the Ai-p Officer Commanding in India to suggest now that these details should not have been passed on to the Afghans or that they were passed on by unauthorised persons, attention is invited (1) to tne last sentence of the Air Ministry letter of the 31st January which runs ”1 hope this information will enable you to provide Fraser-Tytier with enough ammunition to complete the kill” and (2) to the Minister*s statement that he authorised the Military Attache' to pass on the information to the Afghan Air Commandant. The Afghan Government accepted the offer on the 20th February on the basis of the information supplied to them. The Military Attache' gave the Afghan Air Commandant to understand that the engines were fresh from overhaul and though he did not specifically state that they would be good for 500 hours flying, they seem to have deduced this for themselves from the details given. (It is incidentally rather difficult to discover the origin of this figure of 500 hours flying wnich was first mentioned in Katodon '48, but I think it comes from the Air Ministry’s statement in their letter of 31st January that the aircraft were in very good condition and should be capable of three or four'hundred hours more flying in Afghanistan on the assumption that the normal amount of flying done there would be from 150 to 200 hours a year. The natural deduction/(6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 (8650) Wt.40880/22 10,000 1/39 Minute Paper Department deduction from this would be thet the aircraft would be capable of an average of about 500 hours fiying.^ The Air Commandant remarked that the British Government had always treated the Afghans fairly and he was ready to assume thatthqywould get a fair dealj. We may entirely agree with Si*’ Kerr Fraser-Tytier ’ s statement that it is imperative from the political point of view that H.M.G. should leave the Afghan Government with no grounds for dissatisfaction and we can accept all the three assumptions in paragraph 7. His proposals as regards the first batch of 10 machines are as follows:- (1) that the three unserviceable engines should be replaced by engines with ndfless than 200 hours to run before overhaul; (2) that the Afghans should be promised that arrangements will be made for the free overhaul at Karachi of any of the remaining seven engines which show mechanical defect due to wear and tear and not to accident within the next 20 hours flying. (20 hours flying is suggested as giving a reasonable time to form a fair estimate of their condition and to discover which, if any, of the engines will need to be overhauled at our expense to give the Afghans a fair deal - Katodon 51)j (5) that payment of the first instalment by the Afghans should be deferred until the second batch of machines is delivered. He thinks that if these proposals are agreed to he would be .able to explain the position to the satisfaction of the Afghans on the ground that time was too short to admit/admit of overhaul 'before the planes left Egypt. As regards the second 'batch of 10, he regards it as essential that they should all he overhauled before delivery. In the meantime, the Air Officer Commanding in India had sent off a telegram to the Air Ministry which was repeated to the Middle East (P.Z. 3762) in which he said that if it was considered politically desirable to satisfy the Afghans’ understanding that all machines v/ould be capable of 500 hours flying, the unserviceable engines snould be replaced by others with 500 hours flying life and that five more engines v/ould be required to allow the remaining air frames 500 hours flying life. As regards the second batch of machines they should either all be capable of 500 hours flying or be accompanied by sufficient spa^e engines to produce that life. This rather strikes one as a telegram sent off in a fit of temper without much regard for what is practicable. I understand from the Air Ministry with whom I have discussed it, that these engines are not capable of more than from 300 to 350 flying hours without overhaul and to carry out these instructions literally would mean supplying spare engines for practically the whole 20. Not only would this be extremely expensive but there are not enough engines available. The Viceroy in his private telegram of the 22nd June suggests that the Secretary of State should support these recommendations, but he was no doubt not aware of the practical difficulties. Even if the engines were available, it would be almost hopeless to expect the Air Ministry to accept extra expenditure on this scale. The/Minute Paper Department 5, The Government of India's telegram of the 26th June puts the position very fairly in paragraph 2 hut their suggestions in'parag^aph 3 as to the action necessary to put things right are a little puzzling since they start 'by referring to the Air Officer Commanding's recommendations discussed above and say that these, if accepted, will enable the Ministry to put things right with the Afghan Government and then having done so proceed to comment on Sir Kerr Fraser- Tytler's proposals, making suggestions of thei^ own. They agree with (l) except that they would have 4 engines immediately replaced, i.e. they include the one said to be likely to need overhaul within the next six months. As to (2) they say that overhaul at Karachi would be very expensive and they therefore recommend that 3 more spare engines should be supplied within six months for the three that are said to be good for one year only. They also accept (3). As regards the second batch they agree that all must be overhauled before delivery or alternatively that they should be supplied with sufficient spare engines to give a life of 500 flying hours to each air frame. As overhaul might take some little time, they think the Afghans might be persuaded to accept a month's delay in delivery. These proposals appear to ensure that the Afghans receive a fair deal and to stand the best chance of acceptance by the Air Ministry. There is, however, one difficulty that the Air Ministry have warned me may arise and that is that if too many replacements and spare engines are demanded for the first/6 .. first batch, there may not be enough left in Egypt to complete the second batch. That, hov/ever, seems to be a difficulty for the Air Ministry to surmount. In the last paragraph of their telegram, the Government of India discuss the question of the extra cost involved and say bluntly that as the defects in the air craft delivered and the misunderstanding due to the Middle Eastern telegram are no fault of theirs, they cannot agree that any part of the cost of the additional engines or overhauls should fall on their fund. In principle one cannot but sympathise with the Government of India’s views on this point* The Air Ministry have let us down very badly and they ought to pay. The important thing, however, is to get matters put right with the Afghans and I should hope that it may prove^to get this done first and to leave the question of how the bill is to be met for future settlement. It must be remembered that the Government of India will have some money in hand (ten tnousand pounds) when this transaction is finally completed as they are getting the machines for a thousand pounds each from the Air Ministry and selling them to the Afghans for fifteen hundred pounds. Out of this ten thousand pounds they have agreed to pay for the flying of the aircraft and the transport of accessories from Karachi to Kabul and for supplementing the pay of the British instructors at Kabul. This should not amount to more than three thousand pounds at the most, but the Government of India will not be in pocket until the Afghans have paid the third instalment which is/Minute Paper Department 7 is not due until 1941. It was originally proposed that any surplus left over should t&gt;e used to make a free gift of a few training machines or* spare engines to the Afghans so that it would not he unreasonable to agree to an arrangement whereby the Government of India would eventually refund to the Air Ministry any balance left over towards the cost of the spare engines now required. But the Air Ministry will certainly have to be made to foot the bill for the time being. We have so far been dealing with the Air Ministry informally over this question in the hope that this would produce quicker results, but I think that the time has come when we should write to them officially supporting the Government of India’s proposals and expressing a hope that steps will be taken to carry them out at the very earliest possible date. A draft is attached accordingly. It might also be helpful if the Secretary of State were to write a personal letter at the same time to Sir Kingsley Wood and ask him to give the matter his personal attention. A draft is attached on these lines. (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 (OOIU; J.U,WV V/'JV (8650) Wt.40880/22 10,000 1/39Draft Paper. Department.

If we had understood that we were being offered engines which having done an average of 360 hours flying v/ere necessarily going to require an expensive overhaul in the near future - for we are now given to understand that these engines will not run for more than from 350 to 400 hours without overhaul - we should certainly not have thought it possible to put such a proposal to the Afghans. What we were told by your Department was that the machines would all be in good condition and capable of at least 2 or 3 years flying in Afghanistan and this is what the Afghans have been led to expect. Prom the political point of view it is of the utmost importance that the Afghans should not be left with any feeling of dissatisfaction over this deal.

It will be calamitous, especially in the existing international 9 situation, if the improved relations which have been so carefully fostered are once more impaired as the result of a feeling on the part of the Afghans that they have not been given a fair deal over this transaction. There is another aspect of the matter also, which I am sure will not have escaped you, and that is the effect on the reputation of the R.A.F. itself of supplying machines that the Afghans find unsatisfactory. The excellent work done by Russell-Stracey and his Air staff in training Afghan pilots on the old batch of Hinds^made a considerable impression on the Afghans^ in welcome contrast to the efforts of the Italians, and as a result they were extremely pleased to accept the offer made to them to purchase a further 20 Hinds. This offer in fact was most opportune - and we are very grateful for the assistance of the Air Ministry in the matter - since it was made just in time to prevent/4 prevent the Afghans from concluding a deal with the Italians for the purchase of more machines from them* It will he highly unfortunate if they are now driven hack into the arms of the Italians as the result of dissatisfaction with the machines supplied to them hy us* I regard the matter for these reasons as so important that I am sure you will not mind me asking you to give it your personal consideration so that we may devise the best means of remedying the unfortunate position that has arisen* I hope you will find it possible to accept the suggestions of the Government of India,which in my opinion represent the minimum that will enable us to satisfy the Afghans* In particular I regard it as essential that all the second batch of 10 machines should have an overhaul before delivery. I realise that some extra expenditure will be involved but I trust that this is a difficulty which can be over-come and that we shall not waste time in arguments as to where the money is to come from.

S#»tJwy W 9tato. // ^ ^ Ik{T'O**? 1 ' ^ wo, fas 11^ !*** ■ liM*' 7 i v\ 2^ The story of the sale of the Hind aircraft is as follows:- A suggestion was made by Minister, Kabul that it would be good policy to provide the Afghan Government with British aircraft, vide his telegram of the 11th November, 1938. As a result of this the Air Ministry made a proposal on the 21st December stating that. as they had no new Hinds, part used aircraft of this type should be supplied at a favourable price in sufficient numbers to bring up the existing eight Hinds at Kabul to two full Squadrons of twelve air craft. V The Air Ministry were prepared to guarantee these Hinds as fully serviceable, maintained up to highest British standards, and fit for use in British Service Squadrons, for a further two or three years from the date of supply to Afghan Government. The Afghan Government accepted this offer and a price was fixed at £1500 per aircraft, including full equipment. Minister, Kabul was informed in telegram No. 9-Forminka, para. 3, that the condition of all aircraft was good and flying times since new averaged 415 hours per airframe and 360 hours per engine. Negotiations were concluded about the middle of March and the Afghan Governments formal agreement was given. The first batch of ten Hinds arrived at the Aircraft Depot, India about the 21st April. They appeared to be in fairly good order but some of the airframes and engines were not those referred265 to in Mr. Cromoie's letter. However, on the average, their flying times were less. The figures actually were as follows:- As received at Karachi Average life 245 hours. As indicated in enclosure to Mr.Crombie's letter. Average life 152 hours, Mr. Bradley, Messrs. Hawkers representative, was at Karachi while the aircraft were being erected, and had full opportunity to examine them. The A.O.C. saw the first two or three in process of erection. The ten aircraft were flown to Peshawar on or about the 11th May. One engine gave trouble on the way up and could not be rectifi- ed in time to fly up to Kabul on the 14th May as arranged. The A.O.C. saw the Assistant Commandant of the Afghan Air Force and promised him that a new engine would be supplied in place of the one which had become unserviceable. On the 14th May, the remaining nine aircraft flew up to Kabul and were handed over to the Afghan Air Force. One more engine went unserviceable on this flight, and the A.O.C. immediately signalled Air Ministry asking for two replacements. A few days later a communication was received from Kabul,stat ing that in accordance with the interpretation placed on the attach- I ment to Mr. Crombie f s letter by a meeting consisting of Minister, Kabul, Military Attache*, Mr. Bradley and the Commandant, Afghan Air Force, the aircraft delivered in Kabul were not according to specification. On investigation it was discovered that theexpression ’’Time Since Overhaul - Nil” had been taken to mean that all the engines, though not new, had received an overhaul making them good for a further 500 hours flying, and that they had done no flying since this overhaul. It was apparently on this basis therefore that the Afghan Government had accepted the conditions of sale. There were a few additional complaints but none of substance. The position now is that Air Ministry have delivered ten Hinds « according to the specification la|d down in telegram/J No. 2174 dated 21st December, 1938. Two of these at the moment are unserviceable, and we have undertaken to make them serviceable at no cost. The Afghans on the other hand are under the impression that they are going to get 500 hours flying, or something approaching four years flying out of their purchase. If we sire to hold the Afghans to the strict interpretation of the bargain they will undouotedly feel, that they have been let down. The A.O.C. has therefore recommended to Air Ministry that, if it is politically undesirable to offend the Afghans, fully over hauled engines or additional engines capable of giving a further life up to a total of 500 hours should be provided. Briefly this would mean that for the two unserviceable air craft in the first batch fully overhauled engines should be provided. For the remaining eight aircraft, engines capable on the average of giving a further 250 hours, should be added to those already supplied to the Afghans.A wlyC - &gt; t / 1 Finally, the A.O.C. recommended that the engines in the second batch of the aircraft due to be delivered in August should either be capable of 500 hours flying or that spare engines to make up this amount of flying should accompany them. We are still awaiting the Air Ministry observations on this proposal. Sir Headquarters, SIMLA. 18th June 1^39.&lt; Telegram from Viceroy dated 22nd June 1939. 1281-S Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram 366, June 14th. Aircraft sold to Afghanistan. June 18th, 50 Katodon, particularly paragraph No.6, which, if not quite so gloomy in forecast as paragraph No.3(d) of Katodon 43, shows that three engines out of ten have already become unserviceable and a fourth will need overhaul within six months. This is so unsatisfactory that I agree with Fraser-Tytler that Afghans have solid grounds for complaint, which must be removed. Commander-in-Chief, whom I have consulted, has sent me note recorded by Air Officer Commanding, of which a copy will follow by air mail. This note seeks to show that (with the exception of engines already proved unserviceable) aircraft supplied are up to the standard promised, though owing to misunderstand ing not up to the standard which Afghan Government were led to expect. A.O.C. has made direct to the Air Ministry recommendations that (a) additional engines should be supplied on 'no-cost' basis which will give up to 500 hours flying for all 10 aircraft hitherto supplied; (b) engines in second batch due for delivery in August should be capable ox 500 hours flying, or that spare engines to make up that amount should accompany aircraft. This goes rather further than suggestions made in paragraph No.8 of Katodon 50 on which our official comments will follow as soon as possible. Air Ministry have not yet replied to A.O.C., but if they reply as soon as possible to his recommendations it should be possible for Minister to put us right with Afghan Govt.

At the same time Air Commandant was informed that engines were fresh from overhaul.

Yes, I discussed these drafts at some length with Mr. Crombie on 10th June. In particular, I felt bound to point out that we ourselves were already in a position to answer to a large extent (b) and (c) of the 'crucial questions' referred to, and to answer them in a sense very unfavourable to the Air Ministry: it is fairly clear, even allowing for a certain amount of undue pessimism on the part of the British instructors at Kabul that the aircraft supplied/-&gt; Miiiutes. supplied are not according to specification, and also that they are not up to the standard which the Afghans have been led to expect (which is not quite the same thing, owing to the mass of semi-official information which has been sent to Kabul about them and a good deal of which has probably been passed on informally to the Afghans either direct or through the British instructors). But as regards (b) the India Office are very anxious not to M incriminate” the Air Ministry too definitely at this stage in an official telegram, and they consider that the draft as it stands will oblige the Government of India (and more particularly the Air Officer Commanding India) to do this for us or to show that the British instructors are wrong. (Mr. Crombie is consulting his higher authoritie on a suggestion of mine that the Simla authorities should be urged in a private telegram not to let the Air Officer Commanding ”get away with it” by any general statement to the effect that he was satisfied that the facts had been misrepresented). As regards (c) the suggested amendments are designed to disentangle as far as possible the officially communicated facts from those (particularly/ NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN.Minutes.

This is of some importance in view of the misunderstanding referred to in the minutes on N 2680; though admittedly we cannot evade moral responsibility even for the latter category. Query concur.

S.W.1. 12th June 1939, Dear I spoke to you over the telephone on Saturday regarding your proposed draft signal to the Government of India External Affairs Department dealing with the sale of aircraft to Afghanistan. I do not know if I made myself clear to you concerning the question of overhauling engines for the Afghan Air Force. I want you to realise that I fully appreciate the political significance of satisfying the Afghan Government, and on that question the Air Ministry are anxious to co-operate whole-heartedly, but I want to ensure that our friends are not led to believe that v/e will do something for them which in practice may prove impracticable on financial grounds. &amp; . &gt;1 4 . 11 It is really most unfortunate that the Afghan Government should have been told that all the engines v/e were giving them would have 500 hours to run before they became due for overhaul. I feel that it is very dangerous for people who are not conversant v/ith our technical phraseology to make deductions on matters of this nature*, as they are ’certain to make mistakes which might have far reaching and unfortunate repercussions. It is clear that in this particular instance an incorrect deduction has been made and I would suggest that v/e should try to ensure that such mistakes do not occur in future. So far as the Air Ministry is concerned, we agreed to supply secondhand Hinds which had done an average of approximately 360 houi'S flying per aircraft and, according to the Kabul report, the aircraft delivered have carried out an ' average of only 300 hours flying; none of the engines would therefore be due for overhaul for approximately another fOO hours. I do not think anyone could reasonably expect the i-Tr Mi: Ministry to carry out twenty complete engine overhauls about 200 hours before they were due on a deal of G.E. Crombie Esq., India Office, LONDON, l s.w.i . h ! pW ^ W.. ^ ^-t&lt;rk/r tiJix*. -V - ^ ^I t this nature. In fact it would mean obtaining special ^ financial approval as it is outside the terms of the - agreement. Of course, if you consider the matter is of sufficient importance, you might care to put the case up ^ afresh and obtain Government approval for the supply of new or completely overhauled engines, b ut t here would be considerable delay. Alternatively, you migKt like to consider making h’promise to the Afghan Government of a gift of, say, ten or fifteen used engines in about a year’s time; that would tide them over the next year by which time there might be some money in the fund to pay for these additional engines. Referring to the overhaul of a Kestrel engine. It takes approximately 1200 man hours to overhaul one engine; to undertake the overhaul of the 20 engines sold to the Afghan Air Force would therefore absorb approximately 24,000 man hours, which would be quite beyond the capacity of the R. A.F. Depot at Karachi, unless the work was spread over a fairly long period; and, anyhow, it would require investigation before a decision were made. You will realise that the Depot establishment at Karachi is designed to meet^maintenance requirements of the eight squadrons in India; if as a matter of policy they are in future to carry out overhaul work for the Afghan Air Force as a permanent arrangement we v/ould, of course, have to consider increasing their establishment in certain trades. An alternative to overhauling the engines in India would be to send them home to a civil firm. A considerable amount of overhaul work for the R.A.F. is put out to contract and &lt; it costs abouti£&gt;00 for the complete overhaul of a Kestrel .^ r engine' (as installed in the Hind). To this figure, of ^ ^ course, would have to be added the charges of transporting the engines from and to Afghanistan. We discussed certain, amendments to your draft signal to the Government . of' India; when these are embodied, may I please see an amended &lt;£ppy ? dr Let me know if there are any further points you wish to discuss.

The previous submission is at P.Z. 1363/39. The Afghan Prime Minister agreed to the purchase of 20 Hind aircraft on the terms proposed (P. Z.l656). The first batch of ten machines were duly shipped to Slgypt and arrangements were made for them to be flown to Peshawar on 12th May and from Peshawar to Kabul on 14th May. 2L The Minister at Kabul has now transmitted a most disturbing report by Flying Officer Burt Andrews, the head of the British Mission of Air Instructors in Afghanistan (Katodon telegram No.43 of 27th May at P.Z. 3348/39). It appears that one of the machines has failed to proceed beyond Peshawar (owing to a very b?=d internal water leak in the engine) while one of those now at Kabul has developed cracked cylinders. Flying Officer Burt Andrews reports:- (a) That only four of the aircraft actually delivered correspond with the machines mentioned in the list previously furnished by the Air Ministry which gave particulars of the actual mrchines which it was proposed to supply to the Afghan Government. (b) That all the engines have done an average of nearly 300 hours flying since their last overhaul. (c) That all tbe engines are in bad condition owing to poor maintenance. (d) That these engines will very soon require a complete 3 On receipt of this report we immediately brought the matter to the attention of the Air Ministry, who took the matter up with Air Headquarters in the Middle East and in India. Copies of the Air Ministry telegram and of the 9/38 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 1/39 „ „ .. i overhaul.tfi replies now received from the Middle East and from India are enclosed in the Air Ministry d.o. letter of 7th June below. It will be seen that the Air Officer Commanding P. in India does not share the view of the British Instructors at Kabul as to the condition of the aircraft and appears to think that the position is quite satisfactory except for the tv/o aircraft which are definitely unserviceable and which are now being replaced. ^ As regards the specific complaints from Kabul mentioned above:- (a) is of no moment if the machines actually supplied were up to the standard promised by the Air Ministry, though it would appear from the telegram of 4th June from the Middle East that owing to the international situation and to the non-arrival in Egypt of certain replacements of aircraft from this country the Air authorities did not find it possible to release all the aeroplanes originally destined for Afghanistan, and that they may have supplied instead less efficient machines. (b) The R.A.F.authorities originally estimated (see the enclosures to the Air Ministry letter of 31st January and para.3 of Forminka No.9 of 8th February at P.Z.707/39) that the average number of flying hours c omplete d by all the 20 Hinds which were being supplied, calculated up to the dates of their release to the Afghan Government in April -t-VJune, would be 3 60. Unfortunately, owing to the clumsy drafting of one of the R. A. F. signals enclosed in the Air Ministry letter of 31st January, the Minister at Kabul also inferred that at the time of their delivery to the Afghans none of these machines would have done any flying since their last overhaul, and he informed the Afghan Government in this sense. He no doubt concluded (as we did here) from the correspondence forwarded by the Air Ministry that all the engines would be overhauled as a/ .. k/r C-fc. 3 ^ tit: HPaper Department a matter of course before they were pltcked up in Egypt for shipment to India. The Air Ministry have now informed us that this was not in fact the case and have given us to understand that the engines supplied bad not done sufficient flying since they were new to qualify for their first overhaul, and that engine overhaul is an expensive and lengthy process which could not hpve been provided in the case of these aircraft at the price for which the machines are being sold by the Air Ministry (viz. i'lOCO). The position has been explained to Sir Kerr Fraser Tytler in Mr.Peel’s telegram of 31st May (P.Z.3348). The Minister can hardly be blamed for drawing the conclusions he did, though in view of the actual position it is unfortunate if the Afghan Air Commandant has been allowed to deduce that the engines supplied would be good for a further 5C0 hours flying without overhaul. (c) and (d). There seems to be a considerable conflict of evidence as between the Air Instructors in Kabul and the A.O.C. in India (see his telegram of 2nd June below). It can perhaps be deduced from the A.C.C.’s telegram that when the two unserviceable engines are replaced all the aircraft will be capable of about 200 flying hours before overhaul, though this is not absolutely clear. We are not in a position to say exactly how much usage they are likely to receive in Afghanistan, but on this basis it seems reasonable to suppose that the machines would not require to be overhauled for another year. In any case one is inclined to agree with Sir Kerr Fraser Tytler’s comment that from the layman’s point of view it does not appear that the aircraft fulfil/V fulfil the spirit of the guarantee given (on the authority of the Air Ministry) in para.3 of our telegram (P. Z.8251/38). This paragraph stated:- H Air Ministry are prepared to guarantee these Hinds as fully serviceable and maintained up to highest British standards, and state that they would be fit for full use in British Service squadrons for a further two or three years subsequent to the date of supply to Afghan Government. ' (c.f. the description given in para.3 of the Air Ministry d.o. letter of 31st January (P.Z.707/39)). Nothing at all was said by the Air Ministry to indicate that the machines would not remain serviceable for more than a short period unless say £500 was expended on giving an extensive overhaul to each engine. It is for consideration whether we ought not to write at once officially to the Air Ministry and lodge a protest with them on these grounds, but on the whole, especially in view of the conflict of technical evidence, it seems best at this stage to ask for further observations from the Government of India and from the Minister at Kabul in the light of the information and explanations now furnished by the Air Ministry. In any case it seems doubtful whether there is really much practical advantage to be gained from an official protest since newer engines suitable for replacing those delivered to the Afghan Government are probably not available. Similarly to demand the immediate overhaul of the ten engines due to be delivered to the Afghan Government next July would certainly delay their delivery for several months, while we should almost certainly become involved in a long wrangle with the Treasury on the question of paying the cost. JPjaft/Minute Paper Department 6. Draft telegrams are submitted accordingly, asking for further observations from the Government of India, and the Minister at Kabul. We might also suggest tentatively the possibility of undertaking to provide the Afghan Government with free overhauls as and when required in the case of each engine, if Sir Kerr Fraser Tytler considers this necessary in order to mitigate the unfortunate political effects on Anglo-Afghan relations if, as seems probable, the Afghan Government consider that they have not received a fair deal from H.M.G. in regard to these aircraft.

Air Officer Commanding in India to whom Air Ministry telegram was repeated telegraphed in reply of 2nd June to the effect that British instructors at Kabul had taken unfairly gloomy view and that he considered it sufficient if the two engines now reported as unserviceable were immediately replaced and ten engines for delivery in July had not less than 200 hours to run before overhaul. He added that he had taken close personal interest in these aircraft.

Ext AIR MimSTRY, \ KING I CHARLES STREET, Whitehall, S.W.1. 'J'th June , 1939. In confirmation of our telephone conversation the following is a 'brief review of the action taken by Air Ministry since the receipt of the signal received from British Minister, Kabul, regarding the state of the Hind aircraft sold to .Afghanistan. You will recollect that I expressed the opinion at the time that I considered an unduly pessimistic picture had been painted by the Hawker representative in Kabul and that it was difficult for me to believe that the aircraft were_^in the poor condition reported. ' V/e, however, signalled A.O.C.-in-Chief, Middle East with instructions that a further 10 engines with at least 200 hotirs to run before overhaul were to be despatched to India as soon as possible. You will remember I called to see you the same day as that signal was despatched and told you what action we had taken. We have now received a reply from A.O.C.-in-Chief, Middle East, to the effect that the 10 best available Hinds were chosen for despatch to Karachi, and a copy of this signal is at Appendix A. We have also received a signal from A.O.C., India, in which he states that he considers the Hawker Rolls representatives at Kabul have taken an unfairly gloomy view of the position, as he himself has taken a close interest in the aircraft supplied to Afghanistan, and that he considers that two new engines would be sufficient. A copy of this signal is at Appendix B. At Appendix C is a copy of a signal v/e have despatched to A.O.C.-in-Chief, Middle East, in which instructions have been given for 2 Kestrel V engines / to be G.E. Crombie, Esq., India Office, S.W.l.to tje despatched to India forthwith. You will note this signal also gives instructions that the engines in the next hatch of Hind aircraft are to have at least 200 hours to run before overhaul. You will remember that we also discussed the question of whether or not engines should have more than 200 hours to run before overhaul. Personally, I consider that the Afghan Government could not expect us to give them engines with longer lives, and 200 hours would give them approximately a yea^s flying per engine at British standards. I am not able to judge whether or not the Afghans would carry out more or less flying in a year than a British Unit, but I understand they do considerably less, although you will realise that with an energetic British officer in charge of their Air Force their number of flying hours is likely to increase. It is therefore extremely dangerous for us to tell the Afghan Govern ment that the aircraft will last them for any definite period of years, as the life of an aeroplane or engine is measured in hours in the air. I hope this matter is clear. If not I will be only too pleased to come over and discuss if with you. Y our s cAPPENDIX A Cypher Message TO: Air Ministry Rpt. H.Q. India PROM: Middle East.

Please see Crombie^ letter to me P.Z.jlG 9/39^ dated 7th February 1939 which enclosed list of aircraft to be supplied (? with) certain details. Burt Andrews now reports that:- (a) only 4 of the aircraft mentioned therein are included in the batch now in Kabul; (b) all engines have done average of nearly 300 hours flying since last overhaul; (c) all engines are in bad condition owing to poor maintenance; (d) 6 engines will very soon require complete overhaul; (e) although equipment for overhaul is here, workshop facilities do not yet exist-. 4. Afghan Government are not aware of the exact position but have been told that engines have done no flying since last overhaul, see enclosure to Crcmbie^ letter. Burt Andrews fears that if Afghans are now told that 6 engines, in addition to 2 apparently unserviceable, require considerable overhaul in the very near future, they will consider they have not received fair deal. He therefore recommends that all (? 10) engines be replaced by enqines which/- 2 ~ which have done no flying time since last ccsnplete overhaul* 5* I support this recoiamendation* I am of course not in the position to comment on technical merits of the case hut, from the layman 1 s point of view, it does not appear that the aircraft fulfil the spirit of the guarantee given in paragraph No. 3 of Forminka telegram No, 90* It seems only reasonable to expect that machines should arrive in Kabul to (sic, ? in) condition to do at ?

Dear ^ With further reference to our telephone conversation last Saturday I confirm in writing the queries which are delaying the despatch of the equipment for the Hinds which are being supplied to Kabul* We have now been informed by our technical authorities that the photographic and W/T equipment listed on the Schedule of extra equipment and spares required for the 20 Hind aircraft to be supplied to the Afghan Government is unsuitable for fitting into Hind aircraft. In the circumstances it is suggested that the Afghan Government should be asked whether they are prepared to accept standard equipment as fitted into Hind aircraft which are used by the Royal Air Force* Furthermore Appendix , A f to the Schedule of Equipment states that they require 800 20 lb. bombs and 400 incendiary bombs. As we produce both incendiary and 20 lb. bombs in tv/o types we would have to ascertain from Kabul which types they require. The incendiaries are made as 25 lb. and 4 lb. bombs and the 20 pounders are designed in two types, the first to be carried in a bomb container and the second to be carried on a universal carrier. Before we can take supply action we will obviously have to be told which types they require. A draft signal covering the question of photographic and W/T equipment and bombs is placed below for your approval and onward despatch. jfi'XCrombie , India Office, King Charles Street, LONDON, S.W.l* YoursI u qnfidhjntial . &gt; wm&amp; m:m* 2413 4^y- Nq&gt;417-CTB v dated Peshawar, the ^tji April 1939 Prom - Norwef, Peshawar.

The Minister at Kabul has now had further discussions with the Afghan Government on the basis of the instructions contained in our telegram of the 8th February (P.Z.707/39). The result of these discussions is reported in his telegram of 24th February (Katodon 14) at P.Z. 1202/39. It will be seen that the Afghan Government are attracted by H.M.G. r s offer and would like to purchase the 20 Hinds on the terms proposed (viz. £1,500 apiece) together with the ancillary equipment mentioned in paragraph 5 of the Minister*s telegram. The total cost of the whole transaction to the Afghan Government is estimated at about £48,055 (about Rs.6,40,000). The Afghan Foreign Minister states, however, that the Afghan Government v/ill be unable to pay. the v/hole amount in cash. They offer to pay ^third of the total on delivery of the first batch of 10 machines in April and the remaining «thirds in April 1940 and 1941. Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler thinks it possible that if H.M.G. were to insist on payment in a shorter time the Afghans might agree but he does not recommend such insistence in view of the danger that it might lead to a breakdov/n in the negotiations. If the deal goes through the Afghan Government have agreed to retain the mission of British Air Instructors at Kabul at its present strength. This is satisfactory and we can I think concur in Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler*s view (para. 5 of his telegram of 14th February at P.Z.1000/39) that this is the only stipulation which we need make to the Afghan Government 3 Wt 8900/111 10,000 4.88 and/and that the question of’ their employing any additional number of aircraft which will have to be maintained) should be a matter for subsequent adjustment. 3. In their telegram of 2nd March (P.Z.1346/39) the Government of India suggest that discretion should be left to the British Minister to make a final effort to obtain better terms from the Afghans in regard to payment but that he should be given authority to conclude the bargain immediately on the terms already offered by the Afghans if he considers this advisable* On this basis and on the basis of the figures mentioned above&gt; the Government of India are prepared to finance the whole transaction subject to the conditions mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 6 of their telegram of 2nd March. The Government of India*s total liability under the scheme v l939-40 will amount to roughly £38,055 (about Rs.5,00,000; as explained in the previous minutes the Air Ministry have agreed to sell the aircraft to the Government of India for £1,000 for re-sale to the Afghan Government at £1,500 each) for aircraft and accessories, plus a further sum estimated at Rs.50,000 in respect of to 'tastswe and (c) supplementing the pay of the Instructors at Kabul, i.e. atotal sum oi about Rs*5,50,000* Prom this thev will be able to Jte^TRs.2,13,000 (i.e. 1/third of £48,055) representing receipts from the Afghan Government next April, leaving roughly Rs.3,37,000 to be met by the ' Government of India out of their own resources.

I have discussed this matter with our financial authorities and it seems that with the system of accounting in force, it is not important when the Air Ministry receives credit from the Government of India for the sale of the twenty Hind aircraft and .ancillary equipment providing the amount is credited irW' the financial year 1939 - 1940. ^ith regard to parachutes, armament equipment, wireless apparatus and cameras, you can safely assume that, even if the Air Ministry is not in a position to supply all these themselves, they v/ill be ready to act as agents in procuring from the manufacturers the equipment desired by the Afghans. With regard to the question of inspection at Karachi, this would presumably be done in collaboration with the Royal Air Force Depot at that place. It is difficult to know what sort of a technical examination could be carried out, but it is certain that any repair that is found to be necessary could probably be done at the Depot if required. This is really a matter to be taken up with the Government of India and Headquarters, Royal Air Force, in India and is not one which the Air Ministry can make any final pronouncement. We concur in your proposed telegrams. u Yours sincerely, • l G.E. Crombie, Esq., India Office, Whitehall./ P.Z.1363/39 Immediate. 6th Ilarch, 1939 We should he grateful for the views of the Air Ministry on Praser-Tytler ’ s telegram l T o. 14 of February 24th and the Government of India’s telegram l T o.353 of 2nd March ? copies of which were enclosed in India Official letters ro.xWZ.1202/ 39 of 25th February and Mo. P.Z.1346/59 of 2nd March respectively, on the subject of the sale of Hinds to the Afghan Government. 2. We very much hope that the Air Ministry will be prepared to agree to the Government of India’s request in paragraph 3(b) of their telegram that His Majesty's Govern ment should not insist on being paid by the Government of India until January 1940, since at present the success of the ’whole transaction appears to hinge on this proposal. On the basis of the figures given in the telegrams (note that £ 30,0'0 should be substituted for £40,000 in paragraph 5 of the Government of India’s telegram of 2nd March as intimated in their subsequent telegram of 3rd •.arch) the Government/ Wing-Command or L. Dar val I, M.. 0. , Air Ministry HGovernment of India’s total liability under the scheme during 1959-40 will amount to roughly £38,055 (= Us.494,715) for aircraft and accessories plus a further sum estimated at 2s.50,000 in respect of (a) flying the aircraft from Karachi to Kabul (b) the transport of the accessories from Karachi to Peshav/ar and (c) Supplementing the pay of the instru tors at Kabul viz. a total sum of about Ps.5,44,715. Prom this they will be able to deduct Ps.2,13,000 (viz. one third of £48,055) representing receipts from the Afghan Government, leaving 2s. 3,31,715 to be met by the Government of India out of their own resources. In view of financial stringency and the resent depleted state of their Afghan fund they propose to defer payment to His Majesty’s Government pending the receipt from the Afghan Government of payments of 2s.1,70,000 and 2s.1,15,000 which should accrue to the Fund in September and December next respective ly. As we understand the position they will be ready to pay the Air Ministry the total amount due for aircraft and accessories (viz. about £38,000) before the end of the financial year 1959-40, though no doubt you will wish to have confirmation of this. 3./£ / / / / 3.

CONFIDENTIAL. Extract from Intelligence Summary of the Military Attache, Kabul, No. 7, dated 18th Feby.1939 Kabul. B. 4. Internal Security . A certain number of Afghan Air Force pilots, drawn entirely, it is stated, from the Hawker Hind flight at Kabul have been touring by road in the Katawaz and the Shinwari country. The object of these tours appears to be two-fold. In the absence of adequate maps it gives the pilots a good knowledge of the country over which they may have to operate in the event of tribal disturbance, and in conversation with local people it is evidently hoped to spread information regarding the effectiveness of air action in suppressing outbreaks. It is reported that these pilots, at various places visited, have been explaining the ease with which bombing and machine-gunning can be carried out from the air. A detailed reconnaissance was carried out in Katawaz with a view to selecting a suitable aerodrome in that area.Minute Paper 1 f P.Z. 1029/39 political Departm ent Mr. Walto i; ^ A S^cv^tr^ j So^L LU h &lt;^ 1 *, (mJc c*- ^ . There is great difficulty about a successor to Russell Stracey, and, after discussion with Darvall of the Air Ministry and Halford of the Foreign Office, I would propose, if you agree, to send the attached draft telegram to Metcalfe asking him to sound Russell Stracey, who is now due at Delhi, and endeavour to persuade him to change his mind and return to Kabul after a period of leave in this country. It is suggested that his services are of such importance that he might well be offered a considerable increase of pay and also a free passage home. The extra expense might be met from the surplus proceeds of the sale of the aeroplanes to the Afghans. As you know, we have always contemplated that some of this should go on the salaries of the instructors. Darvall and Halford have both concurred in the draft.

I believe that the Air Commandant, though undoubtedly biassed in favour of the Italians, lias tried to be as fair as possible. Such matters as the longer flying hours allowed to the Italians and the transference of Russell- Stracey *3 pupils to the Italian contingent were simply due to the fact that M.Ihsan realised that the British could train pupils much quicker than the Italians could.

One would have expected last year*s experiences to have choked the Afghans off Italian aircraft fbrever. (An Italian engineer was here recently inspecting the Romeos, and aerodrome reports have it that he passed only four machines out of tne sixteen as fit to take the air.) I can only surmise, as I suggested in my telegram that our extreme reluctance to sell in 19bb-b6, and the price of our machines, put, une Afghans off to such an extent that they preferrea to negotiate with Italy rather than to risk a snub by making a further request to His Majesty's Government.

P.Z.707/39 Proposed sale of 20 Hind aircraft to the Afghan Government. tary ef Staters The general situation in regard to this question v/as explained in the minutes at P.Z.7790/38 and H.M.G.’s plans for selling 20 Hind aircraft to the Afghan Government were outlined in the India Office telegram of 21st December last at P.Z.8251/38. The main feature of the scheme is that H.M.G. should sell the 20 machines to the Government of India for £ 1,000 each and that they should be irmediately resold /S'® * to the Afghan Government for £1500 each, the surplus profits of the latter sale being employed by the Government of India in helping to maintain the present mission of British Air Instructors at Kabul or for other useful purposes in connection with the Afghan Air Force as may seem expedient. The continued employment of British Instructors by the Afghan Air Force is regarded by H.M.G. as an essential feature of the scheme. Preliminary negotiations with the Afghan Government have taken place at Kabul, and with the concurrence of the Government of India, H.M. Minister was recently authorised to put before them a concrete offer on the basis of the scheme explained in our telegram of the 21st December to the Government of India. The Afghan reaction to this offer has been extremely favourable. On their own initiative and before they knew how many aircraft H.M.G. were prepared to supply the j Afghan Government informed the British Minister that they required 20 aircraft (P.Z.231/39)• This is extremely fortunate. The Afghan Government have also expressed their agreement to the continued employment of the British mission in the event of their purchasing these machines from H.M.G. (P.Z.231/39) Finally it appears that the price suggested (viz. £1500) will be acceptable to the Afghans if machine guns are included within that figure and this has now been agreed to by the Air Ministry/Ministry and the Treasury (i.e. are ready to sell the aircraft complete with machine guns to the G 0 vemment of India for £1000 each)• which The only difficulty/may he encountered in completing our deal with the Afghan Government is in respect of the terms of payment. It is proposed at this stage that our offer should he put to the Afghan Government on a cash basis. The price of the aircraft is very moderate and the whole transaction is unlikely to cost the Afghan Government more than £40,000 (£30,000 for 20 aircraft and say £10,000 for accessories, munitions etc.). It is therefore to he hoped that the Afghans Government will he prepared to settle the whole transaction in cash.

The Fund is extremely depleted at present and in existing circumstances it seems improhahle that the Government of India could find more than say Rs.l lakh from it for the purpose of helping to finance this transaction. Assuming that the Afghan Government were prepared to pay cash for 10 out of the 20 aircraft (viz. £15,000) and also for any accessories ammunition etc.purchased, an advance of Rs.l lakh from the Afghan Fund might possibly he sufficient to make up the difference required to cover the Government of India’s immediate liabilities in respect of payment to the Air Ministry (viz. £20,000) etc. If unfortunately any larger sum should he required it may perhaps he necessary to persuade the Government of India to set aside a little more money for the Fund—at any rate temporarily.

W.C.2. 7th February^ 1939 Thank you for your letters of the 3rd and 6th February and the draft teleprams which I have discussed v/ith our Finance and Equipment Branches. remarks which follow are made in the same order as laid out in your letter of the 3rd:- (1) Statement in -parapraoh 2 of the draft to Kabul. regarding spares. I think .we can safely say this - spares were sold at full price by Hawkers, Air Ministry price would be much less and we are even halving this. In addition, we are providing a good deal more in quantity. (2) Pape 2. paragraph 2 of draft to Kabul - cameras and wireless equipment. It is doubtful whether Air Ministry could provide these. (3) Pape 5. draft to Kabul, regarding one air frame in moderate condition. The Air Ministry would be prepared to replace air frame K.6696. (4) Parapraoh 3, draft to India, regarding training machines and spare engines. (5) Parapraoh 4, draft to India, regarding a crash in transport. I have studied the points you mention and my See our suggested amendment See our suggested amendment /With G.E.Crombie Esq., India Office London, S.W.lv;ith the exception of certain small matters on which we suggest minor amendments, we agree generally with the draft telegrams and I am returning the two most recent drafts with these amendments shown. The first concerns th/ price of the training machines, which was low. The new price is 'based on the Magister type, which is modem and we oelieve suitable for conditions in Afghanistan. You will remember that when Reay-Jones wrote to you on the 16th January he mentioned the orice of £500 to £600 as ourely a cockshy ; it was, in fact, based on the Moth type - of ^oubtful suitability. The second amendment is necessary because we may have to go to Treasury for permission to release further Hinds if it becomes necessary to do so. There is one further point v/hich I would like to mention, it concerns the possible surplus.proceeds of the transaction and is mentioned in the fiJfflf^part of paragraph ^ of the draft to Government of India. We understand that you are taking up this matter direct with the Treasury. Yours Vat is 'T |'^ rc pf' Q - Op.z. 707 / 39 . Prom Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to H.M.Minister, Katul.

It seems probable that this supply would suffice Afghan Government for considerably longer period owing to much smaller number of hours flown by Afghan Air Force. Price represents approximately one quarter 01 that paid by A1ghans for si: ii1 .r e euipment in 1937* Government of India will no doubt undertake cost of transport of2 spares, etc. from Karachi to Kabul as part of whole transaction. I will av.ait lists af further accessories which Russell Stracey is preparing. Meanwhile it is doubtful whether price of bombs or ammunition could be reduced as compared with 1937 or whether Air Ministry could supply cameras or wireless sets, understand that in 1937 wireless sets were purchased from Marconis. In view of paragraph 3 of Government of India’s telegram of 31st January you will realise that early supply of aircraft and accessories depends largely on ability of Afghan Government to pay in cash. 3* Condition of all aircraft is good and flying time of 20 airframes and O’hjs•.it'-'s c s oii let tea since t no g were new to date of release at end of March or end of June averages U15 hours for airframes and 360 hours for eip ines (details by airmail of 7th February). 4. .a,. t-K; li ght of above information Ihl 11 - gear machine will be acceptable Af gha ' Cvovor’.r wirt j M ou a .certain wlb-.t-ixcr ijfglian Government are now ' prepared/Government 7 s offer on cash basis. 5.

W.C.2. 31st January, 1939. Dear n In confirmation of our telephone conversation of yesterday evening, we have been in touch with the Treasury and are prepared to release ten Hind aircraft for Afghanistan to be delivered at Karachi by the end of April, and ten Hind aircraft to be delivered at Karachi by the end of July. We can also supply an adequate outfit of engine and airframe spares sufficient to last a British unit for 18 months at a price of £330 per aircraft delivered free at Karachi. We have not yet got a list of the other equipment and ammunition which may be required but, for the purpose of comparison of cost, may I refer you to ray letter to Rumbold of the 12th of February 1937, which forwarded a copy of a letter which I wrote to the Afghan Air Commander giving him the cost of ammunition and bombs supplied that year. I have asked our financial authorities whether we can supply further amounts of the same type of ammunition at a lower price but they have not yet been able to sound the Treasury on this. With regard to the guns, the Treasury are prepared to include one Vickers gun and one Lewis gun per aircraft and also the electro-magnetic bomb release gear within the figure of £ 1,000 already specified as the price at Karachi. I also attach a copy of two signals relative to the amount of flying which these Hind aircraft have undertaken. You will see that they are in very good condition and fully capable of much more service, particularly in Afghanistan where, I imagine, they * certainly will not fly more than 150 to 200 hours per aircraft per year. At this rate they should last for three or four years when provided with the spares which we can make available and if the services of a competent mission are retained. /It G. Crombie, Esq., India Office, King Charles Street, S.W.l.oX-c - It might be worth while to point out to Fraser* Tytler that the provision of* 18 months of* spares on the basis of the consumption of a British Squadron probably means 3 years on the basis of the consumption of an Afghan unit.

If on the other hand our people flew the machines to Kabul, this wo^ld go a long way towards demonstrating that they were serviceable craft; and if there were then accidents en route , which is not very probable, we ought I think to be prepared to foot the bill.

Dear This is to confirm one or two points which we have discussed recently over the ’phone, and to thank you for your two letters of the 6 th and 13th January. I am sorry that I have been unable to reply sooner, but there has been a good deal to do one way or another. I am glad to say that three or four second-hand training aircraft can most probably be made available if desired, and although I mentioned a price of £500 to £600 each this is purely a ”cockshy”. the availability at some later date of the more modern type of aircraft. As an interim reply I am able to say that we shall most probably be able to make available a few of the Blenheim type aircraft - say in a year or two. But before giving a definite reply I must make quite sure that they are suitable (and I think they will be) for the height from which'they will be required to operate. In any event, I do not think there will be much difficulty in finding a few of the more modern types after the next twelve months has passed. Other points which might be mentioned are:- (i) We have signalled Egypt regarding the condition and flying hours. We shall of course make quite sure that, before release, the aircraft are up to the descrintion given. (ii) The condition of the aircraft on arrival at Karachi will be our concern. With regard to your letter of the 6 th.

It will be seen from N 5980/10/97 of 1938 that the Foreign Office did iin fact propose the addition to the draft in that paper of the words ’’sufficient spare parts would be available’’. But somehow in the numer- ; ous re-draftings these words got omitted. The 1.0. have now sent a brief telegram, in which (in Mr. Collier’s absence at a meeting) I con- curred, reassuring Col. Fraser-Tytler on this score - see now N SZ' /3/37. (not yet received from 1.0. ) I foresee endless difficulties over any scheme for payments in kind, and in vieV$ of the extreme generosity of our proposals I cannot help wondering whether such a scheme would really be necessary from the point of view of the Afghan Government's financial position. Unfortunately, however, w6 have got to consider Italian compe tition, and v/e know that the Italians have some thing of this kind on the stocks. Col. Fraser-Tytler’s suggestion that we should/should only contribute towards the cost of the mission, rather than pay for the whole of it, seems a good one, and may enable us to throw in an ostensibly free gift after all. Mr. Crombie is in communication with the A. M. regarding the possibility of supplying new aircraft of the latest type, and will let us know the result. ? Copy minutes to 1.0. and await further.

Proposals contained in Forrainka 90 are, I consider, very reasonable offer on the basis of situation as described in my despatch of November 11th. I have the following comments to offer. 3. (a) I am rather sorry that His Majesty’s Government are unable to pave the way by a gift of 3 or 4 training machines. Afghans are much influenced by the prospect of (?offer of) something for nothing and the gesture would have helped toward their acceptance of our proposals. But I agree that if the free gift is not possible, it would be better not to finance a present 4 by increasing the price of service machines. (b) I anticipate possible difficulties over payment of even so small a sum as £12,000 sterling in cash in 1939. Afghan Government have so far met all their obligations on account of instalments payable in cash, and will, I hope, continue to do so, but they are undoubtedly short of foreign exchange. This is probably the main reason why they are negotiating with Italy, since Italian Government are prepared to accept payment in kind, see my Sik*&gt;/ ( ^ es P a ' tG h (? 150) (? December 14th). It might perhaps be r&gt; i advisable for His Majesty's Government to consider whether any form 1IM-' «/£,(» MQh. m. B£P&amp;.| 'S'JAN 1939. -r INDIA OrFJI ✓- 2 - of-payment in kind would 'be possible, e.g. by arrangement with Liverpool cotton interests in case Afghans raise objections over cash payments.

Government must themselves sell their experience has shown that inefficiency of their Agents and (? lach of) confidence in foreign market have made Afghan Government unwilling to agree to any such (? transaction) which must involve/s7 an element nf risk of defaulting vis-a-vis a foreign government. (c) I understand from paragraph No.2 of the (2 corrupt groups) Hinds have (V gone) out of production. I presume, however, that there are sufficient spare parts available to ensure maintenance during the lifetime of those now to be offered to Afghan Government. You will remember that this difficulty ai»rse in 1937 over the proposed sale of Wapitis, (d) I am not sure we should offer payment of the whole of the. salaries of instructors and mechanics. Such an offer might arouse suspicions as being unnecessarily generous. I should be inclined to tell the Afghans that we consider the employment of British personnel integral part of the scheme, but realise they are expensive. If Afghan Government will name reasonable figure as salary they are prepared to offei% we v/ill pay any excess required to provide first class men. Afghan Government would then be able to feel that instructors were their employees and not merely lent. cotton in Liverpool and so acquire foreign exchange, previous Paragraph No. 4.

Since my despatch was (? written) we have information that the Afghan Government are negotiating for purchase of latest type of aircraft.

With reference to your letter (P.Z. 8251/38) of 16th December about the supply of Hind aircraft to the Afghans, I now learn from the Air Ministry that they find serious difficulty in putting through the deal in the form suggested in your draft telegrams. I understand they have v/ritten to you offering to supply 20 surplus but serviceable Hinds direct to the Government of India at a price of £1,000 each delivered at Karachi, on the understanding that, if the actual proceeds of sale by the Government of India to the Afghans exceeds any expenditure that Government may incur on salaries of instructors and mechanics, the Air Ministry will have the benefit of the surplus. This arrangement is acceptable to the Treasury. I gather that the Air Ministry have also said that, if a deal on this basis cannot be made sufficiently attractive Grombie, Esq., India Office.aturactive to the Afghans, they will he ready to approach the Treasury again for authority to accept even less than £1,000 a machine. The Treasury would no doubt give sympathetic consideration to such a proposal should it he considered important on political grounds to make some further concession. Yours sincerely /■■Ml Q.eceeT'. AIR MINISTRY, Ext 20th December, 1938. ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY. W.C.2. Dear Crombie, In reply to your P.Z.8251/38 of the 16th instant. I have discussed the whole matter with our financial people and we are prepared to sell to the Indian Government 20 part-worn, but quite serviceable, Hinds at an inclusive price of £1000 each delivered to Karachi. The first eight in February or March 1939 and the others in the beginning of 1940. Regarding training machines in 1940 we could provide four, perhaps six, at a lower price. ^ While these 20 aircraft will be complete in all jj respects v/ith instruments necessary for flight I should ]jn make it clear that machine guns will not be included in the Hf figure quoted. for the cost of the mission, which must be settled directly between the Government of India and the Afghan Government. The aircraft are provided at this reduced price n the understanding that if as a result of favourable .egotiations with the Afghan Government a surplus on the r hole transaction remains this should be refunded to the ,ir Ministry. eem likely to break down on the score of price, the Air [inistry is prepared to approach the Treasury with the ■iew to getting some further reduction in the price on (Olitical grounds. The Air Ministry cannot accept responsibility If, however, negotiations on the basis suggested G.E.Crombie, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. P.T.OI have amended your telegram to H.M.Minister Kabul to say ''delivered free to Peshawar'. Later in the same paragraph I suggest inserting the words ' at a still lower cost' after the word 'required'.

In course ofconversation last night with the Secretary of Italian Legation I learnt that the Afghan Government are negotiating for the purchase of 20 Italian aeroplanes of the latest model with performance of not less than 300 miles per hour. Secretary said he thought it great waste of money hut Afghans were apparently influenced by desire to build up air force of the latest model aircraft so as to be able to compete with superior numbers of Iranian air force. 3. I should advise early decision on His Majesty’s Governments attitude towards this question. (?

The papers were on the point of being submitted to the Secretary of State a fortnight ago with draft telegrams to the Minister at Kabul and to the Government of India when the Air Ministry discovered after further telegraphic correspondence with Iraq and Egypt that none of the Hind aircraft which it is proposed to offer to the Afghan Government are in fact new (that is unused) machines. This has made it necessary to revise the original draft telegrams. I understand that the position is as follows. The R.A.F. have at present two full squadrons of Hinds (i.e. 24 machines) in service i„ 4ir.i th an equal number of machines held in reserve. The reserve machines are not very much used and it is reasonable to assume that cut of a total of 48 Hinds at least 2C will be in very good condition and entirely suitable for sale to the Afghan Government eight for supply next February or Tfarch and a further eight to twelve about the end of 1939 as proposed in the drafts. The Treasury and the Air Ministry are quite prepared to dispose of these machines for flOCOapiece, but it is proposed to offer them to the Afghans for &lt;£15C0 and use the resulting surplus for the purpose of providing free to the Afghan Government the services of certain British Air Instructors and mechanics st Kabul. The Departments here attach the highest importance to the continuance of the British Mission of Air Instructors and mechanics in Afghanistan and this is in accordance with the views of the Minister at Kabul. The revised drafts which are now submitted have been circulated to the Foreign Office, ^ir Ministry and Treasury. I understand that the Foreign Office will have no difficulty in concurring in them subject to the minor amendments which are indicated in red ink in the draft telegram to Kabul. As regards financial procedure the Treasury are afraid that there may be difficulties at this end'if the Air Ministry sell the aircraft for £1500 each to the Afghan Government and then themselves (i.e. the Air Ministry) proceed to disburse funds in payment of the Air Instructors salaries. I suggested that these difficulties could be surmounted if the Air Ministry sold the aircraft not to the Afghan Government direct but to the Government of India for, say, £1,000 apiece-nd if the government of India simultaneously resold them to the Afghan Government for £1500; the resulting surplus would be paid into the Government of India’s Afghan ^und and used for the purpose of paying the Air Instructors salaries. If this procedure is adopted it might be as well to insert in the telegram to the xovernment o .. j.ndia the additions suggested in pencil in the margin. The whole scheme is quite tentative at this stage pending receipt of the views of the Government of India and of the Minister pt Kabul.

This is to confirm my telephone conversation of this morning. You will have discussed the question of the sale of Hind aircraft to Afghanistan with Mr. Grey of the Treasury to-day subsequent to discussion on the same subject by Mr. Stevens of the Air Ministry with Mr. Grey yesterday afternoon. As I told you, unfortunately none of the available Hind aircraft is new. There is not, in fact, a new Hind available anywhere in the Royal Air Force. I have asked Messrs. Hawkers whether there are any new Hind aircraft available anywhere or whether any more could be manufactured economically. They informed me categorically yesterday that there are no more and no more can be manufactured. Hind aircraft will, however, be in service in the Royal Air Force for at least two or three years and there are adequate supplies of spare parts of all kinds to maintain them. The financial authorities at the Air Ministry are quite agreeable to a preliminary signal being made to India and to the British Minister at Kabul to open discussions with the Afghan Government, the basis being that we now have Hinds of a kind available to supply to the Afghan ? Government sufficient to build up their air force to two lull Squadrons of 12 each, 8 for supply in February or March 1939, and the remainder either at the end of 1939 or the beginning of 1940. You wanted a formula to describe these aircraft and, in consultation with our equipment authorities, we have arrived at the following 'The'The Hind aircraft available for sale to Afghanistan can be described as fully serviceable and maintained up to the highest British standards. They are fit for full use in British service Squadrons for a further two to three years subsequent to the date of supply. Exactly similar aircraft in all respects will be in use in the British Royal Air Force at Home and in the Middle East for a further considerable period. These aircraft are in all respects more modern than any in use in India at the present time and are exactly similar to those sold to the Afghan Government by Messrs. Hawkers in 1937'. ^ As I described to you this morning, the position has been put to the Treasury that it is most important that we should be able to persuade the Afghans to accept these aircraft rather than to go to Italy for further supplies. We hope to hear in a day or tv/o the result of Treasury consideration of this matter and that a final figure, possibly less than £1,000, may be agreed to. ^\ have also discussed with Mr. Lucas of Messrs. Hawkers Limited the question of a technical mission and I attach to this letter a copy of a report which they have received from Mr. Russell Stracey. Their preliminary reaction to RusseU Stracey*s report was unfortunate. Thqy felt that although he had done well from the technical point of view, the attitude of Mohammed Ihsan was so pro- Italian that it was very difficult indeed for them to make much headway in impressing the Afghan Government as to the advantages of buying British in the future. As you know, Russell Stracey has been a sick man for some time and must in any event be sent home to the United Kingdom in the very near future. I represented to Lucas with, I think^ some success that they must not take too gloomy a view of Russell Stracey* s report. It was natural that he should be despondent, considering the comparatively high nopes with which he had started his task in Afghanistan, but from the technical point of view he might congratulate himself on having demonstrated in unmistakable terms the superiority of British aircraft and the superiority of British personnel. So far as we were concerned, the success of his mission in Afghanistan was assured so long as no question arose of the technical mission being with drawn. Lucas informed me in accordance with our discussions during the period leading up to the sale of aipcPO-ft fo Afghanistan that the Hawker Company nad /factin fact supplemented the salaries of their representatives in Afghanistan owing to the inability of the Afghan Government to provide the full amounts required. He made it clear that Messrs. Hawkers would not be prepared to continue to supplement any salaries to their personnel employed in Afghanistan since they would make nothing out of the release to Afghanistan of service Hinds. I assured him -that if for political and other reasons it was necessary to maintain a technical mission in the country, we would not, of course, expect them to continue to supplement salaries. I pointed out the practical difficulties of introducing any sort of military or air mission into Afghanistan at the present time and I assured him that from our point of view and, I believe, also from yours^md that of the Foreign Office, the Italian mission isj^iooked upon as being a military mission in no shape or form, but was understood to be a technical mission for maintenance and instruction on exactly similar lines to that provided by Messrs. Hawkers. He fully understood the importance of maintaining the technical liaison in Afghanistan and understood the potentialities of the future market in this country although he was not optimistic that Messrs. Hawkers themselves would have a suitable aircraft to replace the Hind in two or three years’ time when the necessity arose. I suggested tnat although no suitable Hawker type might be available something could be found from the firms which comprise the Hawker-3iddeley group. He undertook to discuss the matter again with his directors and to do all he could to see that personnel would be available for a technical mission to maintain Hind aircraft for the next two or three years. He foresaw little difficulty regarding mechanics but stated that the question of the pilot-instructor J was more difficult. It was necessary to have a particularly good man who would be able to hold his own against the very large number of very confused influences that were at work in this country and who would continue to maintain the same high standard that had been set by Russell Stracey. He is going to let me know at once the reactions of his directors to the /newnew proposal and I suggested that before anything final was done, a representative should be asked to attend a meeting, possibly to be held at the Foreign Office with you and myself perhaps in attendance. I am sending a copy of this letter to Collier at the Foreign Office. YoursCOPY, P. W. S. Bulman, Esq,., Hawker Aircraft Ltd. , Brooklands Aerodrome, Weybridge, Surrey. Kabul, Afghanistan^ Dated 25th Nov.1938. Sir, I am enclosing a report summarising the work carried out by us and the progress made in the training of the Afghan personnel attached to the Hinds. The report is extremely brief and I trust I have made myself sufficiently clear. I cannot exaggerate the difficulties we have been up against since the very beginning, the reasons for this are probably as follows (a) The superiority of the Italians in numbers, in aircraft and in personnel i.e. 24 aircraft to our 4dght and five mechanics and two pilots to our two and one respectively. (b) The fact that the Italians have an official mission which no doubt is here for the express purpose of 'organising” the Air Force. (c) A distinct Italian 'bias” on the part of the senior non flying members of the Afghan Air Force. Since the outstanding success achieved by us during the last year the difficulties have been lessened but despite this I am forced to the conclusion that the Afghan Air Force authorities do not intend to allow us any headway. The reason for this may be political but at the same time I have been forced to the conclusion that Mohamad Ishan, the Commandant, is in the pocket of the Italians and is afraid to offend them by allowing us any scope. This has been evident from the beginning and shows itself in the fact that any of my suggestions, for the improvement of the Air Force in general, are shelved, and also in other little ways, three petty examples being:- (i) The limiting of the flying hours for the personnel under me. (ii) Attempting to forbid my pilots from carrying out aerobatics as part of their flying training. This, I am told, because the Italian aircraft are acrobatically unworthy. I made this an issue six months ago, and won. However, despite this another attempt was made to stop it soon after I fell ill. (iii) The transferring of my best pilots to the Italians against my advice. I think you will agree with me, that the situation must be brought to a head as it is hopeless carrying on under the present circumstances, and in view r of our outstanding success during the last year, I think, that politically, now is the time to make the gesture for a change of front. In conversation I have given my views to the A. O.C. , R.A.F. , India , The Foreign^ Secretary Sir Aubrey Metcalf and The British Minister. I make the following suggestions for what they are worth:-(a) That the Afghans be advised as to the absolute futility of carrying on as at present. The Air Force must be under one control and they have seen enough during the last year to judge whose control. (b) They get rid of the Italians. (c) We let them have more aircraft. I recommend four more Hinds to complete a squadron. Twelve Harts and Twelve Gauntlets ex R. A. F. (d) An official Air Mission consisting of one serving R.A.F. officer, preferably a Squadron Leader and three airmen (wireless, photographic and armament experts plus our present representatives* I would not recommend a relief to my position under present circumstances. Yours faithfully, (Sgnd.) E.G. Russell Stracey.SUMMARY OP THE WORK CARRIED OUT PUPIEC THE L^OT YEAR. Before giving a summary of the training, a brief description of the personnel under training will help to give some idea of the difficulties that had to be overcome. PILOTS . All the personnel had been partially trained previously in Italy, Prance and Russia prior to the Afghan revolution of 1929, when all v/ere recalled. Prom 1929 to the date of our arrival, the military side of the Afghan Air Force ceased to exist. Out of the eight pilots allotted to me, three had been through a refresher course at Karachi during the summer of 1937. The remaining five had not flown since the interruption of their training in 1929 and had an average of 25 hours total flying. The average age being 33 years. MECHANICS . The mechanics had been through the same training experience as the pilots and we were allotteed three from those who had been trained at Karachi in 1929. *&gt; AIR GUNNERS . We were allotted three air gunners who had obviously been chosen at random, who knew nothing at all and were even incapable of cleaning a gun. Prom the total of 16 pilots and mechanics who had been through a refresher course at Karachi, we were allotted six, three pilots and three mechanics, the remainder being attachea to the Italians. Apart from the above, the standard of the remainder under me was extremely low, and training had to commence from the very beginning. TRAINING. (1) Organisation and Administration . The organisation and administration was to all intents and purposes NIL. My first two months in the country was taken up with making out regulations for flying and every conceivable thing dealing with the care and maintenance of aircraft and aircraft equipment. These regulations were handed by me to the Commandant for translation into Persian and for eventual distri bution to all concerned. This was in March 1938. Up to date I have not seen a single copy of the translation and any knowledge of the above orders to the personnel under me, is due to lectures by us which have to be repeated constantly. (2) Plying Training . All eight pilots are solo and have attained quite a high standard. This despite the fact that, apart from the operations, I have been limited to three days flying a week with one and a half hours flying per pilot. The Italians fly every day and apoear to have no hour limit. I have protested against this and have been told that the reason for this is because their standard of training is far behind ourslI Two of my best pilots havehave been ‘transferred to the Italians despite my protests that their training had not been completed. I was told by the Commandant that he had to do this to raise the morale and the standard of the Italian trainees’. In exchange I have been given four of their backward boys, but have as yet been unable to start on them owing to my illness. (3) Armaments . There is as yet no armament section as this is one of the things which the Italian Mission is to organise. All our # training has been carried out oy lectures and any maintenance ~byj Bradley. We were allowed no bombs or ammunition for training which sneaks volumes for our success during the operations when we dropped some 120 bombs and fired 60GG rounds with only one stoppage. (4) Photography . All my pilots have been trained in the fitting and the working of the cameras and in flying, the niethod of to.King pin Doints, strips and small mosiacs. We have been unable to any forrader' as the Afghans have no one here capable of organising a photographic section. I have offered to get the loan of an / Air Force man from India (The A.O.C. is ^uite prepared to do I this and in fact confirmed the offer while on his visit) whether they avail themselves of this remains to be seen. I made the original offer some six months ago. (5) Wireless . There is a wireless section here, run by conjunction with the Luft Hansa service. We have some co-operation to test our air sets but without have been compelled to work by ourselves with our There is not an Afghan with a working knowledge of any success we have had is due to Bradley. Here (with the co-operation of the A.O.C., India) made getting up an R.A.F. man, but so far with the same above. the Germans in tried to get success and we own lorry, wireless and I have again the offer of results as (6) Workshops. There is a workshop building with a certain amount of machinery which is under the Italian mission. There is no organisation and so far all our own repairs have been carried out by our own people in our own hangars. (7) Stores . The store is run under dual control and any little organisation is due to Bradley. (8) Navigation . For the last year I have tried to persuade the powers that he to huy million sheet maps (we will not sell them anything else) but without any results. Naturally I ha e some difficulty with practical navigation as the only .. available belonged to me - in fact the success of the operati were due, in a large measure, to the loan of my ra6 f is no such thing as a compass base so we marked out a temporary one with the aid of instruments borrowed from taarconi .(9) Care and Maintenance . We have tried to run the whole show on R.A.F. lines and in spite of the Afghan mentality and the triple control have succeeded fairly successfully. This I put down entirely to constant watchfulness, repeated lectures and checking on our parts. (10) Language. In language the Italians have a distinct advantage over us, as about 75&gt;6 of the present air force had their initial training in Italy. Since the day of our arrival I have impressed upon the powers that be the importance of a good interpreter. I soon realised that there was very little likelihood of one materialising, so we got down to it and acquired a v/orking knowledge of Persian and proceeded to teach the Afghans English. In this we have been fairly successful and I can now give a lecture in simple English. air ^ :V ' c j A 7. 7 , tC ^ . TL Mj JJ 4c ^ Lt&gt;%~n~urj +■ j ^ 'i^ r ^ ^ ^ Please see the Minutes at P.Z.7912 below which f ft- have not yet been seen by the Secretary of State. The proposed interdepartmental meeting has now been held and the results of the meeting ere embodied in the draft telegrams to Kabul and to the Government of India submitted herewith. It will be seen that the Air Ministry are now able to promise eight new Hinds for sale to the Afghan Government next February or March to be followed by a further twelve Hinds, either new or only slightly used, v/hich could be made available during the succeeding twelve months or so. A few second-hand training machines could also probably be supplied. The Air Ministry will apparently be prepared to dispose of the Hinds if necessary, even for as low a price as £ 1,000 a-piece, but they and the Foreign Office are averse from offering these machines cheaply to the Afghan Government except in return for a quid pro quo in the form of the continued employment of British instructors at Kabul for the next few/few years as already suggested by Colonel Fraser-Tytler. This would be in the mutual interests as much of the Afghan Government as of ourselves, since it seems improbable that a proper standard of maintenance of the British machines would continue to be observed or that the Afghan pilots would be efficiently trained to fly them if the British mission were withdrawn and the » field left clear for the Italians. From paragraph 3 of the draft telegram to Kabul it v/ill be seen that in order to make the scheme seem more attractive to the Afghans and induce them the more easily to accept our stipulation regarding the British instructors, it is proposed to arrange the price to be paid by the Afghan Government for the aeroplanes in such a way as to cover the cost of offering them the services of the chief instructor gratis and also a free gift of say 4 Hinds. This might be done by selling the rest of the aircraft to the Afghans for say £2,000 each. Mr. Russell-Stracey 1 s present salary is £1,250 per annum. I understand however that he has not recently been in good health and that he probably/‘zzn 3. probably v/ould not wish to remain at Kaoul after the expiry of his present contract in the middle of next February. This is a great pity since Mr. Russell- Stracey has carried out his duties very ef T iciently to the entire satisfaction of the Afghan Government. The Air Ministry are beginning to look around for a possible successor. Before making any firm offer to the Afghan Government v/e shall have to consult the Government of India as proposed in the second draft telegram with particular regard to the possibility of financing the f ft s M scheme by means of credits from the Government of India 1 6 Afghan Fund. This seems quite feasible in spite of the present depleted state of the Fund, if the Afghan r / ^ ^ a ' r Government were prepared, as they no doubt would be, to s u c pay a fair proportion of the cost in cash. . .

I agree generally with your appreciation of present position and am impressed with necessity for taking urgent action on lines suggested in your despatch especially in view of information from reliable sources indicating that Afghan Government have already been in negotiation with Italians for supply of further aircraft. 2, Air Ministry expect to have available during next 18 months 20 Hind Aircraft, either new or only slightly used, which could be sold to Afghan Government at very favourable prices. In particular they could definitely promise 8 new Hinds by next February or March. Latter were recently bought by H.M. G. for their own use but will not now be required owing to progress of re-armament. Air Ministry could also provide a few training machines second hand at reasonable rates. These, and remaindei of Hinds, could be supplied gradually during/Department. during course of next few years in accordance with Afghan Government’s requirements and their ability to pay for them. ?♦ H.M.G. attach highest importance to maintaining and strengthening British influence over development of Afghan Air Force. They would therefore he prepared as special case to offer aircraft mentioned above to Afghan Government at extremely low prices (perhaps even as lov/ as £1,000 per plane), but only on condition mentioned in paragraph 14 of your despatch that Afghan Government for their part would undertake to employ for next few years adequate staff of British instructors and mechanics in order to guarantee proper standard of maintenance of aircraft and training of pilots. H.M.G. regard this condition as essential to scheme since they consider it would be wasteful and misguided policy to make offer on scale proposed on any other terms. Since Afghan Government appear to regard services of Russell-Stracey as unduly expensive it is suggested that offer might be made more attractive if total price of aircraft to Afghan Government were so arranged as to cover cost of salary of Russell/(8610) Wt.25956/285 10,000 9/38 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd.

Details of scheme may take a little time to work out in consultation with Government of India, but it seems desirable to initiate discussion with Afghan Government at once.

We understand that the 8 Hinds which the Air Ministry can supply by next February or March are completely new. It would be useful if you could give us some indication as to how many of the further 12 Hinds, which you could make available during the following 12 months or so, would be new machines. Previous experience suggests that the Afghan Government are likely to be much more attracted by an o^fer of new than of partly used aircraft.

The aircraft in question was purchased from the British Government by the Government of India for resale to Afghanistan. The file contains correspondence related to ordering and shipping the aircraft, and arrangements for financing and making payments. The supply of a number of replacement Kestrel V engines is also documented within the file, as a result of a number of supplied engines proving to be unserviceable; a report outlining possible reasons for the engine failures can be found on folio 141. See folios 32-38 for a copy of the final agreement governing the purchase.The file also contains a limited amount of correspondence related to the maintenance of the British aviation instructors employed at Kabul, as the continued employment of these instructors was a condition stipulated by the British Government for the sale of the aircraft. A report written by Edward George Honeywood Russell-Stracey on the work undertaken by these instructors during 1938 can be found on folios 520-525.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Kabul (William Kerr Fraser-Tytler), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, officials of the India Office (George Edmond Crombie and Roland Tennyson Peel), and officials of the External Affairs Department of the Government of India.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
