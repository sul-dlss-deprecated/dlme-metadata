Your Highness' letter is being forwarded to Government, with a communication from me on the subject above mentioned, as also on the other subjects referred to in that letter. 4, On reply, and the instructions of Government being received, they shall promptly be forwarded to you. 5. Meanwhile, I must, as an old and sincere friend of your Highness, offer my best congratulations on the present very improved state of your Kingdom. G. I have had in former days repeatedly to impress on your Highness that the British Government desires a steady continuation of the friendly relations which have so happily existed now for many years with that of Khelat, and which your Highness, since your accession to the throne, has so cordially maintained. Its sincere desire has always been that a strong and well constituted Government should be established in your country. 7. The success which has lately attended your Highness' efforts against distur bers of the peace will, I trust, tend to encourage you in the endeavour to establish a form of Government and rule which will ensure -quiet and order in your country, protection to your subjects in and traders visiting it, and satisfaction to your people generally. 8. That this may be the result of your administration, and that prosperity may always attend you, is the sincere wish of your friend. W. L. MEREWETHEK, Colonel, Commissioner in Sin J.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00000f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/22, f 108</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00000f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/22, f 108</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Letter from William Lockyer Merewether, Colonel Commissioner in Sind, Kurrachee [Karāchi], to His Highness Meer Khodadad Khan [Mir Khudadad Khan], Khan of Khelat [Kalāt]</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1870/1870</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-29T16:08:13</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 folio</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Letter regarding the letter from His Highness, along with the enclosed copies of intercepted correspondence, and stating that the actions of Captain Robert Sandeman were done without any authority or approval from Merewether and that the matter had been referred to the Government at Bombay.The letter also reassures the Khan of the British Government's commitment to their friendly relations with the Khelat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00000f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
