Political Agency, Bahrain s The 28th August, 1945. To The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain. Airways enquire whether there is any objec tion to dogs being imported into Bahrain by air in transit elsewhere, and I don s t think the possibility of a transit canine passenger halting for the night in Bahrain has ever been envisaged. If Airways arranged a M Dog Transit Camp” and guaranteed any in transit would leave the plane only on a lead and if night stopping here would go straight to the kennels and nowhere else, do you see any objection to them being allowed through in transit? 2* If you agreed, we might consider some method of imposing a penalty for non compliance with the rule e.g., including the regulation in the Customs Rules. I shall be glad to have your comments. Bahrain. n for Political Agent, Bahrain C.No. Of 1364 Office of the Mvi ser to the Government , Bahrain Dated, Ramadhan 24, 1364 September 1, 1945. Reference your memorandum No.3432-2/17 dated the 28th August 1945. The question of the prohibition of dogs coming to Bahrain requires some modification. It is now possible to treat dogs with anti rabies injections which ensure that the dog is immune from rabies for a year. Under these circumstances the Bahrain Government is prepared to allow the entry of dogs into Bahrain on production of a certificate from a Veterinary Surgeon to the effect that the dog has been given injection against rabies. Regarding doepin transit, by air. If B.O.A.C. can arrange a suitable kennel which cannot be entered by any local dogs the Bahrain Government is prepared to allow dogs from aeroplanes to be brought ashore in transit. I agree that there should be a penalty for non-compliance with the rules. Memorandum:- H. B.

For dogs in transit, any new rules that nay be made depend entirely on your Corporation^ ability to ensure that a) all dogs in transit also are covered by a valid certificate of inoculation against r&amp;bies % or b) all dogs in transit are taken straight to a kennel on the aerodrome/jetty on a lead and remain there during their time in transit In Bahrain. 2.

Dear Sir Yours faithfully, for Political Agent, Bahrain &gt; C(491/2/50) BAHRAIN. Dear Agency, 15th September, 1950. is We forward a copy of a letter No*44(L 3/23) of the 22nd August with en closure from the Foreign Office, about regulations concerning the entry of dogs into Bahrain. 2. Will you kindly let us know if any such regulations do in fact exist; and if so, whether the suggestion made in the last paragraph of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries letter of the 15th August would be acceptable to the Bahrain Government ? Yours ever,SHE PORSIGK OFFICE, S.’.i. 1 22nd August, 1950 \ Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 37 (129/39/49) of the 21st l.ay stating that no regulations governing the import of livestock from Great Britain exist in Bahrain, Kuwait, Muscat or the other Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, I transmit herewith a copy of a letter from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the subject. 2. I request t iat you will ascertain whether any regulations are now in force which require dogs entering Bahrain to he injected against rabies and infonn the appropriate authorities in accordance with the last paragraph of the Ministry's letter. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) C.«j. Felly, Bsq., etc., etc., etc., Bahrain. : No. 44 U 3/23)MINISTRY OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES X.A.2. (L 2676/9A05) Animal Health Division. Hook Rise, Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey. 15th August, 1950. Sir, On 7th June, 1949, you forwarded to this Department a copy of a letter dated 21st May, from His Majesty’s representative in Bahrain in which it was stated that no regulations existed regarding the importation of livestock from Great Britain into Bahrain or the other Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. An exporter recently informed the Ministry that, as a condition of entry to Bahrain, a dog was required to be injected against rabies. It would therefore appear that some regulation are now in force and it would be appreciated if enquiries could be made in this connection. It is suggested that the appropriate authorities might also be informed that as Great Britain is free from rabies no anti-rabic vaccine is allowed into this country and the injection of a dog with this vaccine when coming from Great Britain is therefore out of the question. As an alternative safeguard, however, this Department is prepared to provide a certificate stating that the country is free from rabies, and perhaps injection of the animals concerned could be done on their arrival in Bahrain. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) D.P. Reed. The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l.I political Agency, No.2911-2/17 Bahrain, 20th Sept.1950. Sir There has been correspondence in the past * between the Adviserate and this Agency on the subject of the regulations covering the import of dogs into Bahrain. Please refer to your letter of the 1st P-n September, 1945 (1627-29). 2. It is assumed that these regulations are still in force. As far as Great Britain is concerned it is a country free from rabies; no anti-rabic vac cine is available there and the injection of a dog with this vaccine when coming from Great Britain is therefore out of the question. 3 . His ?/ajesty’s Government desire me to enquire whether in these circumstances a certificate issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of the United Kingdom stating that Great Britain is free from rabies would be accepted by the Bahrain Govern ment instead of an anti-rabic injection certificate. I am Sir Your obedient Servant for Political Agent. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government Bahra in.. T of 1369 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 19th Dulhaj, 1369 October 2, 1950. Referring to your No.2911-2/17 dated 20th September 1950, the Government is willing to allow dogs coming direct from Great Britain to enter Bahrain provided that a certificate is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the effect that Great Britain is free from rabies. Under this condition no anti-rabic injection certificate will be necessary. H. B. M*s Political Agent Bahrain.

The import of a dog into the State of Bahrain is prohi bited unless a certificate of inoculation against rabies issued by a Veterinary Surgeon can be produced. 3. The Bahrain Government has in formed us however that they agree to waive the necessity for this certificate in the case of dogs coming direct from the United Kingdom provided a certificate from the appropriate Government department in the United Kingdom stating that Great Britain is free from rabies is provided instead.
