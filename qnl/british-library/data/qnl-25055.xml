P., dated the 27th October 1910, we have the honour to forward for Your Lordship’s information a copy of a revised statement of the expenditure involved in the maintenance of the Naval blockade in the Persian Gulf. The statement shows the cost of the operations under the principal heads of expenditure, both at Home and in India, during the years 1909-10 and 1910-11, and the cost involved during 8 months of the current year, i.e., to the end of November 1911, the period to which the continuance of the operations was sanctioned in Your Lordship’s telegram of the 20th June 1911. The expenditure during 8 months of the current year is estimated at about Rs. 15,51,000, of which it is anticipated that about Rs.^ 9,10,000 will be incurred at Home. The total provision in the Indian Estimates for 1911-12, as stated in our telegrams dated the 23rd Pebruary and 6th March ^ 1911, is’Rs. 20,00,000, and of this amount Rs. 12,00,000 has been reserved tn meet Home expenditure. The total cost of the operations up to the end November 1911 is now estimated at about Rs. 49,10,000 or £327,350. (00 ’gndif / to of 2.

The item of Rs. 61,000 on account of cost of special buildings for troops at Robat referred to in our. telegram of the 25th July 1911 has now been excluded from the estimate of cost of the Arms Traffic Operations, as we have since decided that the charge must be debited to the Military Works head (SpecialDemands). Excluding the above items, the revised estimate for 8 months of the current year amounts to Rs. 12,53,000 or Rs. 1,56,625 per men sem, and is within the rate estimated in our telegram dated the 10th March 1911.

W. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, .4Confidential : ^ Affairs in the Persian Gulf - H.M.S/’Fox' at Masqat, 7th August 1911* Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report on the state of affairs in the Persian Gulf, at the present time* Section I . Disposition of Ship s. 'FOX' - On the Mekran Coast with two launches till end of August, when she probably goes to Colombo* r, PFRSFGS M - Cruising off Mussendam with two launches. 'FSPIFGLE' - Pushire with orders to cruise off Tangistan Coast, reporting periodically, as required, to Political Resident at Pushire; to return to the Mekran Coast about l5th October. 'SPHINX” - Bahrein, visiting all Pearl Banks. She reports that it has been an exceptionally good year and that there have - been no acts of piracy up to the present. There is a report that one well known pirate is out, 'Sphinx” goes to Bushire 15th October. ”MINT0” - visiting launches and repairing them as they come due; headquarters at Hen;]am. Section II * Riture dispositions and refits * In September there will be 'PBRSHUS”, 'ESPIBQLB”, ”0DIN”, 'SPHINX” and 'MINTO”. With the exception of The Commander-in-Chief, 'PERSEUS” II.M.Ships and Vessels, East Indies Station./ 'PERSEUS', thene shipFi cannot put down more than one boat and, unless activity shows itself on the Mekran Coast, I would submit that boat cruising should not commence till the middle of October. There is one cutter left moored at Masqat and the 'WIIIMBREL' hauled up at Jashk. The latter is so slow that she is not worth manning till all other boats are down in October. * I understand from Lieutenant-Commander La Touche that the 'MINTO' is due for a survey and big refit soon. If this is so, the sooner she goes to Bombay the better. I am informed that the 'MASHONA'a' contract for time hire is up early next year and, as she requires a new crank- pin, which is beyond 'MINTO's' powers, and I am not at all certain Karachi could undertake it, she might go to Bombay with 'MINTO' and return as soon as possible. 'MUZBEB', also, might go to Bombay with 'MINTO' and her relief sent down as soon as possible, this would leave 'HAROLD' and 'TAMIL' for the Mekran Coast; the two latter to go to Karachi for a spell and to give leave as soon as the two arrived back from Bombay. Section III . JASIIK . The water supply for the troops is being partially maintained by purchase from the British India Co *s ships fortnightly and an occasional supply from H.M. Ships. CaptainCaptain Craufurd, Intelligence Officer, and two other Officers are on leave till early in October. As the Wireless operators are short and the work trying in the hot weather, I have given Jashk Wireless Station permission to earth aerie1 at 10 p.m. during Aiagist and September. Section IV . SHAT &gt;AL ARAB. There are rumours, from time to time, that the Turks intend to interfere with our buoys and as the con servancy of the Port and Bar is an important matter, a ship has been kept at or near Bushire ready to prevent any interference. section V . Survey s. It has not been possible to do much in this line lately owing to the scarcity of ships. Most of the inner anchorage at Bushire has been resounded by H. K* S. w Alert w f which ship has also commenced a survey of the Bast side of Abu Musa; this requires four days to finish. A plan of Bar and entrance to Zora was made by 'FOX'. '00lN ,f , on arrival, should run the required Meridian Distance to Bunder Abbas, which is reported to be out of position, and will be employed as necessary to co operate with the Indian Surveys in progress. Section VI.Confidential (Report S.N.0 #t P^Q., 7/8/11) Section VI . Arms Traffic .. Arms continue to be imported into Masqat in large quantities and, I understand, a boon is anticipated. AU bin Mousa recently wired to a fim ordering them to double the amount of his future consignments. Rjr the time, the French fim of Goguyer ^ Co., appear to be doing little business. f The trade to the Mekran Coast is dead at present, only a few Baluchis are buying rifles - 2 or 3 at a time. Ali bin Mousa, from whom the Afghans buy large quantities shows no desire to send arms for them, as he still has a considerable amount of their money and informs them that the risks of running the blockade are far too great, at present. The following is a list of arms lately imported Imported into Masqat since April 1911. Ship. Approximate Date. Rifles. Pistols. Ammunition M Tabiristan w April 14 cases - 90 cases ff Adalia' .. June 7th 14 cases - 115 cases ^ersepolis” ^ Armanlstan ,, June 30th 55 cases - 220 cases 'Anatolia' July 22nd 22 cases - 304 cases 'Sambia' July 28th 33 cases 8 cases 169 cases N. ,1. Three more steamers are expected in the near future. After the arms are landed at Masqat, they are sent overland or shipped in dhows to Sohar and other points on&lt;1 * on the Batineh Coast, whence they ai*e sent overland to the Trucial Coast, or are shipped in lar^e dhows fiai of cargo j for other ports up the Gulf, There is also a certain amount of traffic in arms concealed in heavy cargo in steamers. At present it appears that a large quantity of arms are going to the Arab Coast, Trucial Territory and Katr - with what ultimate destination I do not know. But as our treaties preclude the Trucial Sheikhs from dealing in anas, and the Native Residency Agent at Shargeh reports nothing about these dealings, as far as I know, and there- I fore is probably in the swim, I think that it is time that some steps were taken to keep them to their treaties - especially as the Sheikh of Rams has been fined on the evidence of the Native Agent and it appears inconsistent to ignore the bigger Sheikhs, who possibly have the connivance of the said Native Agent. All the evidence I have on this matter is from informers, but I have little doubt of its truth* The Mekran Coast Anas Traffic being stopped and ! with ships watching Ihxssendam, the only unmolested outlet is overland by the Trucial Coast or hidden in the cargo of steamers and the former is, I am convinced, the line that 70% of the arms.are going on now. It is probable that they are stored some way inland from the towns. A place called Genieia, situated whereabouts not exactly known, is mentioned as one dep^t. AA fortnight ago, the distribution of the Afghans in Persian Baluchistan was as follows;- Rampk Motorabad . Kutaioh around Bint Karvran *. # • •« BO • • # BO • • • 30 .10, and • 10 there were also about 30 with Khalifa Khair Mahomed at Kasimabad, near Barapjr, making a total of about 160. I have, etc... (Sgd.) JAM3S C. TANCRD. Captain &amp; S.N.0. Persian Gulf.Copy : Confidential STATE OP AFFAIRS IN THE PERSIAN GULF. H.M.S. 'Pox' at Mueqat. Bth September 1911. Sir, I have the honour to make the follo^dn? report in continuation of ray letter of 7th August, up to present date, when H.M.S. 'POX' is leaving the Persian Gulf. Section I. Distribution of Ships l 'Perseus', 'Pspiegle' and 'Sphinx' are on the Mekran Coast. 'Sphinx' will leave for the Pearl Fisheries when they re-open after Ramazan, about 25th September. 'Odin' is due to arrive in the Persian Gulf about 12th instant. All four Armed Launches are on the Hekran Coast. 'Minto's' head charters are at Jashk, visiting and repairing the Armed Launches. Section II. Future Dispositions . The whole of the available force in the Gulf ! should be kept on the Mekran and Biyaban Coasts during 11 October. If ships are required for the Shat 'al Arab, | ] Qatr or other places, there is nearly certain to be a I] renewal of the running of arms to the Mekran Coast and, should it bo decided that the 'Minto' must go to Bombay for The Commander in Chief, H. M. Ships and Vessels, FAST INDIES.*I ^ f for a refit, the coaling and keeping running of the launches will occupy most of the time of one sloop. Section III, Jashk . No change. An occasional supply of water is still needed from H.M. Ships. Section IV, Shat ’al Arab . As far as I know, there is no change, though I there are disquieting rumours of intended Turkish I aggression. Section V. Surveys . No change. Section VI. Arms Traffic , There are small indications of a certain amount of revival, in a small way* of the Arms Traffic on the Mekran Coast. Both Islam Khan and Barkat have been reported to be implicated in the running of small con signments. The former at Habt (See report attached) and the latter at Kuhistak; the latter lot, consisting of 125 rifles and 120,000 rounds of ammunition, was taken direct to Barkat at Kandal. Reports are current that 1,000 Afghans are trying to arrange to come down in the Winter, and Barkat is asked to look after 500 whilst the other 500 are to be looked after by Islam Khan in the district of Bint. =u t &amp; Arms Traffic Intelli^enco . The Intelligence concerning the Arms Traffic has been in a very unsatisfactory state* with the exception of that furnished by Mr. Gumbley of the Telegraph Department, whose services cannot be over estimated, and there ms little or no other reliable information to be obtained when I arrived in the Gulf. Since then I have detailed Lieutenant H.O. Wanton to reorganise and report what could be done to improve the matter. Captain Craufurd has temporarily placed certain sums at his disposal with which he has experi mentally organised a separate system, with the result that the information now obtained is much more reliable and easier for a seaman to understand. Iwould therefore submit for your consideration that Lieutenant Wanton be placed in entire charge of Naval Intelligence in the (Mlf, this should include all ports. As this will take a great deal or most of the work from the Military Intelligence Officer, the latter would be able to obtain better information as to routes, maps, movements of Afghans etc. in the interior. A portion of the money now allotted to him by the Indian Government, should be placed at the disposal of the Naval Intelligence Officer. The Naval Intelligence Officer should be borne on tie books of 'Fox' and should not leave the Gulf without the permission of the Commander-in-Chief. Lieutenant Wanton is willing to volunteer for aa further two years for this service, and I would strongly recomend his appointment. Section VI. Landing at Habt . (Situated on the Mekran Coasts 4 miles F&gt;. of Sadaich ). Having been informed by Mr. Gumbley. of the Telegraph Department, that 44 rifles and 5,000 rounds of ammunition had been landed at Pahnu. a creek between Jagin and Gabrig, and taken to Habt, I proceeded on 29th August, in H.M.S. 'Fox' and approaching the village after dark, anchored as close as I could get with safety in five fathoms. 2. - A party of 40 men and 4 Officers, under Lieutenant Wolfe Murray, in two cutters in tow of the 'Muzbee' were sent with orders to surround the village in the dark, seize Mubarak the headman and obtain the rifles and ammunition. 3. - Two attempts were made to land, both failing on account of heavy surf and tide; a third attempt at 4.0 a«m* was successful and the village was surrounded at dawn. 4 . - It was found that Mubarak had fled, but his brother being in the village was captured. rifles or ammunition could be found, but as it was certain that they were hidden somewhere in the vicinity, Mubarak’s brother was taken off to the 'Fox'. 5. - A few days later, Mubarak handed over 15 rifles and nearly 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and his brother was released. 6 .-% 6.- The bedan in which the congi^n-ient had been brought over, belon,&lt;tin^ to one Dad Shah - a Baluch, having been located on the beach, was destroyed. Section VIII. Raiding near Bunder Abbas . On 85th August, in response to a telegram from the Political Resident, Bushire, to the effect that it had been reported by the Clerk in Charge at Bunder Abbas (the Consul being on leave) that the Bahrloo tribe were on their way to raid Bunder Abbas, I proceeded to the latter place and ordered 'Minto' to Jashk to be ready to embark troops if necessary. On interviewing the Governor of Bunder Abbas and making what enquiries I could, I could not find any proof that the said Rahrloos intended to raid the town or that they were within 60 miles; so I proceeded to the Mekran Coast. 3. - On 30th August, I received an urgent telegram to theeffeet that the Fahrloos had reached Baghu, 14 miles from Bunder Abbas, and had raided a camel caravan, and that there was a panic in the town. 4. - I at once ordered 'Perseus' to embark 30 native troops and one British Officer at Jashk and to rpoceed to Tender Abbas and strengthen the Consulate Guard to its winter numbers. I also ordered 'Bspiegle', who was then on her way South from Bushire, to join 'Perseus' at Bunder Abbas, whilst I remained with 'Pox', at Jashk, ready to embark further troops in case of necessity. 5.-5. - The raiders hung about in the district till 4th September, when they disappeared with their loot. 6. - 'Fox' with Captain Biscoe, the Consul, on board, arrived at Bunder Abbas at 6.0 p.m. on 4th September. 7. - There being then no further necessity for ships, the 'Perseus' was sent to the Kekran Coast, 'Fox' sailed for Masq&amp;t and 'Espiegle', which ship can anchor close to the town, was left for a few days. 8. - The Governor of Bunder Abbas raised a protest when the additional troops were landed to strengthen the Consular Guard, but it was explained to him that the guard was only being raised to its normal winter strength. 9. - I think it very likely that many raids in the vicinity of Lingeh and Bunder Abbas will occur this winter, as the tribes in Southern Persia are getting more disturbed and lawless yearly - if such a thing is possible.Section IX, Arms and Ammanition captured since March .

I119 Telegram P., No. 589—2-M., dated the 5th September 1911. From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department, To—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief. The necessity or otherwise of continuing the arms traffic operations after November 1911 is now under consideration, and it is requested that the Govern ment of India may he favoured with your opinion on the subject. Should continuance he deemed desirable, will Your Excellency kindly wire what scale of operations is recommended. This is with reference to my telegram* No. 115— * Serial No. 14. 294 (-lYT rvf Q^th .Tnnfi.120 Telegram P., No. 86, dated the 7th September 1911. From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. (Repeated to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, by mail on the 7th September 1911.) It is considered that the blockade must be maintained in view especially of the negotiations 'w hich will take place at the end of Ramzan between the Sultan of Maskat and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It seems to me that it will not be possible to come to terms with the Sultan if he finds that tve do not wish to press the blockade. At present I am proceeding on the lines indicated in my letter No. 33, I', j* -^th February 1911, and the number of launches have been reduced. With tour launches we shall, I think, be able to manage the operations this season, but I am unable to say definitely that they will be sufficient as the time oi seriously running arms has not yet come round. On an average I propose keeping in the Persian Gulf two extra vessels and the three subsidised ships, i.e.^ five cruisers in all.

C. considers necessary, I have sanctioned continuance hire of four launches for arms traffic purposes after 31st August, subject to notife of one month to terminate hire. \From Viceroy, 14:th March 1911. Please refer to your telegram of 14th May 1909 approving of accom modation for two companies at Robat being improved at cost of Rs. 6,500, divisible equally between home and India. Occupation of posts at Robat, Sain dak, and Kacha in greater or less strength will be necessary for some years to come both to drive arms traffic further west and thus add to its difficulty and also to protect and foster trade which is being attracted to Quetta by the Nushki route. Contingencies which may arise from the political conditions in Persia are also important factors requiring the presence of troops. Heat, however, in these places during April and May is very great, and at all times the surroundings are of the very worst. Kacha being least unhealthy of these places, we are concentrating the detachment there for nine months of the year, redistributing them as circumstances require between the three places during three remaining months when the gun-running season is at its height. In order to preserve health of troops and to mitigate hardships inseparable from climate and to lessen unpopularity of service in this locality, we consider it essential that proper accommodation should at once be provided at Kacha at a cost of approximately Rs. 61,000, employment of civil labour being considered advisable. Subject to proper estimates, which are being called for, w r e^ ask your Lordship’s sanction by telegraph to the accommodation being provided at once. From Viceroy, Ibth March 1911. (Repeated to Bushire.) Foreign Secret. Afghan gun-runners. My telegram of 3rd March. Our latest information does not confirm report of presence of 3,000 Afghans near the coast, though their numbers are undoubtedly large and include 100 horsemen, which is new departure. After careful consideration we think it undesirable to send strong expedition to proceed inland into Persia, and prefer to repeat last year’s plan, and by landing troops when necessary try to cut off any parties wdio may land arms or damage telegraph lines. We propose to employ force 1,000 strong in two ships to operate east and west along Mekran and Shibkuh coasts, all arrangements being left to the Naval Commander-in-Chief. It is not possible to give accurate estimate of cost, but we take it roughly at Rs . 2,00,000 a month . We should be glad to receive very early sanction, as the season is already advanced and gun-runners may now give trouble at any moment.

In event of Afghans not coming in large numbers, this year’s expenditure will be reduced as far as is compatible with efficiency.

We are unable to recommend the establishment of mobile column at Robat. Riding camels are not available, and it would take several years to create an efficient force of this nature.

To 14 NOVI 910 vV/ Jpa FsFP ^ THE EIGHT HOHOUEABIH YISOOUJJT MOKLET OF HUCKBMH, O.M., Nts Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Si?nla, the 2^11 October igro. My Lord, With reference to our telegram of the 10th August 1910, we have the honor to forward for Your Lordship’s information a copy of the latest revised estimate of the extra expenditure involved in the maintenance of the Naval blockade in the Persian Gulf. 2. The estimate shows the cost during 1909-10 and for 8 months (up to the end of November) in 1910-11, based on the scheme of operations recommended by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station in May last ; also the probable cost during the remainder of the current official year, and for three months in 1911-12 if the operations are continued on the same lines after November 1910. According to this estimate the total cost of the operations to the end of 1910-11 is Rs. 28,73,520, and if the operations are extended beyond that date the additional extra expenditure would amount to about Rs. 1,11,000 per mensem. 3. The revised estimate does not include the cost of preparation of any of the Royal Navy vessels employed on the operations. We understand from • Received with Your Lordship’s despatch, No. letter No, 4322, dated the 27th June 68-Political, dated the 22nd July 1910. 1910, from the Admiralty, that Indian revenues are liable for the cost of the special fittings for the “ Odin ' and “Alert ”, and we assume that the claim on this account will be adjusted direct by the India Office. 4. With reference to Your Lordship’s telegram of the 26th September 1910, we are considering the question of organising a military mobile force for operations from Robat, and will shortly submit our views on the subject. 1 he cost of such operations has not yet however been estimated,nor are we in a position to say what consequent reduction will be possible in the scale of Naval operations. Excluding the possible military operations the cost of^ which, if they are under taken, can be met without difficulty from ordinary savings, we anticipate that the cost of the Arms Traffic operations during 1910-11, as now being carried out, will be met from the existing provision (Rs. 26 lakhs) in the estimate for the current year. 5. To avoid confusion in the adjustment of expenditure connected with the operations we have issued instructions to our accounts officers as to the charges which they should adjust in India, all other charges being adjusted at Home in such manner as Your Lordship may direct, in consultation with the Admiralty, having regard to the normal subsidy of 100,000 a year paid for the three subsidized vessels of the Royal Navy and to the special subsidy of about f'jjOoo I 2 NOV. 102 /hie., tpQ^ a month to be paid for the additional vessels employed on the operations substance of these instructions is as follows (a) In the case of the three ordinary subsidized vessels of the Royal Navy the only charge to be adjusted in India is the cost of coal locally purchased, the debit being to the ordinary Marine esti- mates in respect of normal supplies and to the Arms Traffic operations in the case of supplies in excess of normal requirements. rn In the case of the additional vessels of the Royal Navy the cost of ^ coal locally purchased for these vessels during their employment on the Arms Traffic operations will be adjusted in India against the operations, but no other charges. the case of the launches, all charges will be adjusted in India against the operations, including the cost of locally purchased coal aid stores and the cost of replacement of any Europe stores sup plied, but excluding the cost of passage out of the crews for the launches and charges for pay, rations, etc., of the men of the Royal Navy who have been takerTirom the ordinary complement ot the subsidized and additional Royal Navy vessels, the case of the two Royal Indian Marine vessels specially M ^ (d) In employed on the Arms Traffic operations, all expenditure will be adjusted in India, the extra expenditure arising from the cost o these special operations being debited thereto and the balance or normal expenditure to the ordinary Marine estimates.

This interpretation is however wrong. The information on uf.iohthe revised estimate of payments to the Admiralty in 1910-11 waswas based j ipas solely derived from a telegram sent by the Government of India themselves on the 10th August last giving their latest estimate at the time oj the cost of the operations* We have no information as to the probable amount of our payments to the Admiralty of a more recent date than that given in the Viceroy's telegram referred to, and no addition therefore is necessary to their estimate of total cost as a consequence of our telegram of 11th October* The net result of the two errors, viz* that in respect of coal and that in respect of the Accountant General *s revised estimate is (1) an under-estimate by the Government of India of the total cost of the operations by ... ... &lt;111 *852 (2) an over-estimate, due to misinterpretation of the Accountant General 's revised estimate, by ... ... 20,000 Net over-estimate &lt;1 8,148 A further minor correction still required, is the addition of another &lt;£1,000 to the estimate of expenditure on coal in 1910-11* I understand tnat nothingnothing was included in the Budget on this account, that d2000 was entered in the revised estimate (see telegram to Viceroy 11th October), but that &lt;£3000 will probably be spent.

This difference accounted for as follows:—Present estimates for 1909-10, more by Rs. 1,86,000, and for 1910-11 less by Rs. 9,00,000. Increase in 1909-10 chiefly due to larger issues of imported coal and stores used on works for Royal Indian Marine and other vessels, and increased hire of transport animals. Decrease in 1910-11 chiefly due to reduction in requirements of coal, smaller subsidy, reduced charges for launches and less contingencies and Army charges, partly counterbalanced by increase in expenditure on stores and wireless telegraphy in Persian Gulf.

After a careful consideration in Council of the Indian case, I satisfied myself that neither under the report of the Welby Commission, nor under Tttg terms of the Rosebery award, could a claim be made on the Imperial exchequer for the entire additional cost with any hope of success, and without the risk of re-opening the wider question of the sufficiency of the existing subsidy, on which, as Your Excellency is aware, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty entertain a very strong- opinion. 3. In these circumstances I had no alternative but to accept the rough estimate contained in Admiralty letter of 2nd December 1909, and as a basis for the actual assessment of the charge upon Indian revenues I have further accepted generally the proposals made in Admiralty letter of 27th June. I have the honour to be, My Lord, lour Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn. 8733. I. 1325. — ' / ■ - • -V ■■ .EXCLOSURES. Sir, M. 01,161. Enclosure No. 1 . Admiralty to India Office. Admiralty, T 2 nd December 1909. l. am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Louncil, that they have given careful consideration to your letter of the loth October last containing copy of an extract from a Despatch from the Government of India on the subject of the arms traffic on the Persian littoral. 2 . My Lords recognise the serious political difficulties which may have to be faced if this traffic in arms is not effectively checked, and ^ leiefore piepared to co-operate with the Indian Government in their efforts to suppress the trade by establishing a naval blockade on the coast. 3 For this purpose they propose to detail two additional ships, viz., LI is Majesty s ships “ Odin ” and “ Alert,” for service under the orders oi the Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station. These two vessels are at present being refitted, but it is anticipated that they can both be commissioned within the present financial year. 4' meantime the Commander-m-Chief on the East Indies Station is taking steps to bring a blockade into being, and by January next the four cruisers “ Fox,” “ Perseus,” “ Proserpine,” and “ Philomel,” are expected to be engaged on this work. 5. The temporary increase of the East Indies Squadron will render it possible to arrange for the periodical relief of one or two ships for repair and recruiting the health of the crews, and will enable the Commander-in-Chief to maintain four ships continuously on blockading duties. Such a blockade should arrest fairly effectively the development of the traffic carried on by the arms-running dhows, but the efficiency of the blockade would be greatly increased if eight steam launches or small steamers or tugs were hired by the Indian Government at Indian ports and attached to the blockading cruisers. Ships’boats cannot catch a dhow with a fair wind and can only make captures by lying in wait at the dhow s destination, in which case preconcerted signals from confederates on the shore may warn the dhow of the danger of capture. 6 . In addition it would be very desirable to have the co-operation of three Bombay torpedo boats and one Royal Indian Marine ship to act as depot ship for them, provided that these torpedo boats are in a sufficiently good seaworthy condition. If the Secretary of State agrees, it is proposed that the Commander-in-Chief should be instructed to report on this point. 7. I am to state with reference to your letter of the 8 th November that it is expected that one of the subsidised ships will be fitted with wireless telegraphy this financial year and the remainder as soon as practicable next financial year. Four of the six vessels which will take part in the proposed blockading operations are already fitted with wireless, andnrrlprq have been given to fit the remaining two. My Lords expect, thprefore that the Secretary of State will see his way to proceed with the eshbthment of the tireless stations at Jask as early as possible and that the “tggestions for the increase of the military gjiard there and the aLointaent of a special intelligence officer wi 1 be carried out concurrently with the establishment of the naval blockade. o Mv Lords presume that not only must the blockade, in order to be effective^ includefhe Biyaban as well as the Mekran coast, but that when fw cmsts are effectively blockaded it is not improbable that the arms- runniim vessels would also attempt to run their cargoes on the coast of Baluchfstan to the eastward of Gwatar. t would not be possible without altogether extravagant preparations to extend y® J 16 J f siderable scope of the naval operations, and My Lords wouicl tee suggest that the Indian Government should consider the desirability oi establishing concurrently with the enforcement of the naval blockade, a military cofit patrol from the Persian ^'V^^'lin' th' mav be necessary. An organisation somewhat on the lines Egyptian Coast Guard would appear to meet the case. 9 As regards expense, the Indian Government should it is proposed be directly responsible for the whole cost connected with the torpedo boats amUhe depot ship and the steam launches. Maxims and three- pounder guns would he provided by the Admiralty. 10. It is impracticable to estimate approximately the total additional cost of the naval operations, but it will be recognised that the proposed action, if continued throughout the whole year (omitting peLiaps the period of the south-west monsoons should the state of the traffic admit of it) must entail a very considerable additional charge upon Lava Azotes. It involves particularly the commissioning of two ships, His Majesty’s ships “ Alert ” and “ Odin,” which have been kept m reserve since 1904, and the upkeep of these vessels during their specia service in the Persian Gulf. In addition the East Indies Squadron has been comparatively recently reinforced by H.M.S. Philomel, ^ owing mainly to the demands for the constant presence of His Majesty s ships in the Persian Gulf. Moreover a considerable expenditure m coal, special fittings for ships working in the Persian Gulf, &amp;c., will have to he incurred before the two extra ships arrive on the station. 11. A rough calculation has, however, been made, on the basis of the subsidised ships, in respect of the three additional ships I hilome , “Odin,” and “ Alert,” and it is estimated that, excluding the expense previously referred to, the extra cost for the year vi ould amount to 84,000Z. My Lords do not admit the contention of the Government ot India that this charge should, in accordance with the report of the Loyal Commission on Indian Expenditure, be borne by Imperial Funds, as m their opinion it is very largely, if not entirely, a matter concermug the administration of the Government of India, and they propose, accordingly, to make a claim for the repayment of the same from Indian Funds. .

As stated in Admiralty letter M. 01,161, of 2nd December, the “Philomel” was added to the station owing mainly to the demands for the constant presence of His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf, and it was necessary to replace her on the Mediterranean Station by commissioning another ship, the “ Medea.” It is considered that in her case the cost should be reckoned from the 3rd November 1909, the date of her arrival in the Persian Gulf. The “ Odin ” and “ Alert ” were specially commissioned for the blockade, and their cost should be reckoned from the dates of commissioning at Cape Town and Bermuda respectively, viz., “Odin,” 11th January 1910; “Alert,” -- - • * the “Alert” r.... -A ' when the vessel was detached on service between Aden and Berbera.

(c) I he Government of India to bear the whole cost m respect of the “ Hardinge.” 2 . The blockade will probably be found to have involved considerable extra cost in respect of coal consumed by the other ships of the squadron (“Hyacinth,” “Fox,” “Perseus,” and “Proserpine,”) and additional wear and tear to their machinery caused by continuous cruising. Their Lordships are prepared, however, to accept this cost as a charge to Naval Votes, provided that the proposals at (a), ( 6 ), and (c) are also accepted. 3. I am to request the concurrence of the Secretary of State in the above proposals m order that a claim may be made out accordingly for the whole period over which the blockade has extended. It is noted in this connection that, although formally sanctioned till the 30th April, the blockade has remained in operation till now, and the Government of India in their telegram of 7th June, recommend its continuance until December next.

Government of India sanction blockade on ines originally proposed by yon, including use of eight launches, but in view of serious financial position here desire to know whether you could not carry out operations effectively without reducing troops but without emplovino- transport ship(s) which is very costly. As regards disposal of arms, please see telegram from Secretary of State of 1 st January. Please arrange to destroy arms and ammunition captured on ‘ Khairi.’ No mention should vfivTu 6 , boraaI]land m connection with movements of troops. McMahon has ordered Mekran levies to cooperate with navy and warned tribes on British Beluchistan coast. As regards rumour of reported attacks on Charbar, Government of India must leave it to local naval authorities in communication with officer commanding troops on spot t 0&gt; take necessary action, but raid inland should be limited to purpose of seizing arms stored m villages. Afghans should not be attacked unless they are engaged in removing arms or actually threatening Jask or Charbar. The whole position must be reviewed in April owing to pressure of financial situation, and Government of India are confident that Your Excellent will exercise every economy compatible with efficiency.” Orders have been communicated to Political Agent, Maskat, in terms of 3 -oui telegram of 1 st instant, but, pending further instructions from you we have withheld order as to communication to Sultan about his not suffering pecuniarily. In view of possibility of large claims we trust this questioS may lie over. Sultan is clearly conniving at traffic, and has not acted up to his promises. Meanwhile, Political Agent has been instructed that, if Sultan himself refers to the subject, he should be told that the question of pecuniary loss will be referred to Government of India. About 3,000 hollow '303 bullets were found in Afghan cargo captured last March, and about 3,500 expanding bullets have been found in this season s captures. With reference to your enquiry about Nejd, we are of opinion that it would serve no good purpose to enter into communication with the Chief as he appears to have no effective jurisdiction on the coast, and it might lead to revival of his proposal for secret understanding with us vide your Secret Despatch No. 17, dated 3rd May 1907. ! . .5^ 0 4^ r/ HatfU.: A 1 267 Telegram P„ No. S.—531, dated the 17th September 1910.

August 1910, askirg my opinion as to ,■» i j. . necessity or otherwise of continuinff the arms traffic operations in the- Persian Gulf after November next, be pleased to lay the following remarks before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General of India in Connell. 2. If the results which w r e have obtained are to be in any way per manent, it will be necessary to continue the blockade at any rate until the intentions of the Afghan gun-runners have declared themselves. The Kesident ^ . Persian Gulf has already received information by. telegram, dated 12 th instant, irom Jask of one force coming from Afghanistan to the t Not with this. coast. (Copy of telegramf annexed.) , „ „ . this is correct, it points to a further attempt on the part of the Afghans to get arms through. If, upon their arrival on the coast, they find the blockade still in force and no signs of weakening on our part, it is possible that they may he so discouraged that they will give up the game. It all depends upon us, but if we raise the blockade at the com mencement of the season, we shall acknowledge ourselves beaten, and the arms traffic will be renewed with greater vigour than ever. 3. If, however, the operations be continued through the next season, it will convince the arms-runners and dealers that the effort made is part of a settled policy, and that we do not allow any arms to pass through. This will probably be accepted as an accomplished fact by the majority, and if so, it may perhaps be possible to considerably reduce expenses soon after the beginning of the New Year. Having once committed ourselves to the policy of stopping arms, it would only add to our troubles in the near future if we were to allow the Afghans to think that there is any difficulty in the way of continuing that policy to the end. The more strongly it is enforced now, the less will our ex penses he in the future. 4. I propose to assemble the whole of the available Naval force in th e Persian Gulf in November, and to visit various places on the coast where i^ may he useful to make a demonstration of strength. I then propose to main tain four cruisers {i.e., three subsidised and one additional ship), seven launches and the “Minto ” in the Gulf until we have ascertained the intentions of the Afghans. If the latter should come down in force and threaten reprisals, it may he necessary to ask again for a military force to be placed at my disposal. Should the Afghans give up the attempt and not come down to the coast, it may he possible, in [February or March 1911, to send back four launches, retaining only three for the remainder of the season, but I cannot give a decided opinion upon these points until the situation has developed further. 5. Under any circumstances it would not he advisable to reduce the garrisons of Jask and Chahbar until the end of next season. 6 . It would also he economical to place the Consulate at Bandar Abbas in a state of defence, as recommended in my letter No. 38—1462-XVI of 2nd March 1910, so as to avoid a repetition of the events of last season, when it was necessary to keep a ship constantly in touch with the Consulate on account of the threatening attitude of the Afghans. If the same thing were to occur again next season, it would probably he necessary to maintain another cruiser in the Gulf, which would add greatly to the expenses.Telegram, dated (and received) the 15th August 1910.

After a careful consideration in Council of the Indian case, I satisfied myself that neither under the report of the Welby Commission, nor under the terms of the Rosebery award, could a claim be made on the Imperial exchequer for the entire additional cost with any hope of success, and without the risk of re-opening the wider question of the sufficiency of the existing subsidy, on which, as Your Excellency is aware, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty entertain a very strong- opinion. 3. In these circumstances I had no alternative but to accept the rough estimate contained in Admiralty letter of 2nd December 1909, and as a basis for the actual assessment of the charge upon Indian revenues I have further accepted generally the proposals made in Admiralty letter of 27th June. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. Admiralty to India Office. AI. 01,161. Admiralty, k ]r ’ 2nd December 1909. I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that they have given careful consideration to your letter of the 15th October last containing copy of an extract from a Despatch from the Government of India on the subject of the arms traffic on the Persian littoral. 2. My Lords recognise the serious political difficulties which may have to be faced if this traffic in arms is not effectively checked, and they are therefore prepared to co-operate with the Indian Government in their efforts to suppress the trade by establishing a naval blockade on the coast. 3. For this purpose they propose to detail two additional ships, viz., His Majesty’s ships “ Odin ” and “ Alert,” for service under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station. These two vessels are at present being refitted, but it is anticipated that they can both be commissioned within the present financial year. 4. In the meantime the Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station is taking steps to bring a blockade into being, and by January next the four cruisers “Fox,” “Perseus,” “Proserpine,” and “ Philomel,” are expected to be engaged on this work. 5. The temporary increase of the East Indies Squadron will render it possible to arrange for the periodical relief of one or two ships for repair and recruiting the health of the crews, and will enable the Commander-in-Chief to maintain four ships continuously on blockading duties. Such a blockade should arrest fairly effectively the development of the traffic carried on by the arms-running dhows, but the efficiency of the blockade would be greatly increased if eight steam launches or small steamers or tugs were hired by the Indian Government at Indian ports and attached to the blockading cruisers. Ships’ boats cannot catch a dhow with a fair wind and can only make captures by lying in wait at the dhow’s destination, in which case preconcerted signals from confederates on the shore may warn the dhow of the danger of capture. 6. In addition it would be very desirable to have the co-operation of three Bombay torpedo boats and one Royal Indian Marine ship to act as depot ship for them, provided that these torpedo boats are in a sufficiently good seaworthy condition. If the Secretary of State agrees, it is proposed that the Commander-in-Chief should be instructed to report on this point. 7. I am to state with reference to your letter of the 8th November that it is expected that one of the subsidised ships will be fitted with wireless telegraphy this financial year and the remainder as soon as practicable next financial year. Four of the six vessels which will take part in the proposed blockading operations are already fitted with wireless, andgiven to tit tne remaining two. My Lords expect, establisliment of tl e - k e of the military guard there and the that the suggestions ^ '^ntell^tence 6 officer ^will be carried out SS wthlheTsiahlishmenfof the naval blockade. 8-. My.mds pres^e that -tA effective, include the Biyaban as well as ; b u that the arms . these coasts are °n the coast of runnmg vessels ^'^^“^fjhwatar. It would not be possible Baluchistan to t an( . prepara ti 0 ns to extend the already con- without altogethei . ■ ‘ ‘« at ; ons an d My Lords would therefore siderable scope of e „ ^ should consider the desirability of suggest that e 1 c t ^ e enforcement of the naval blockade, a establishing, concu &gt; • frontier as far to the eastward as military coast patrol from the t ersian trontiei as m mav be necessary. An organisation somewhat on the lines o Egyptian Coast Guard would appear to meet the case. 9 As regards expense, the Indian Government should it is proposed be cW% Sponsible fo’r the whole cost —llaSims ah Xe- boats and the depot ship and the steam launches. Maxims and pounder guns would be provided by the Admu a t}. 10. It is impracticable to estimate approximately the total additional cost of the naval operations, but it will be recognised that the P 10 P 0 ^ action, if continued throughout the whole year (omitting peAaps Ae period of the south-west monsoons should the state of the traffic ad of it) must entail a very considerable additional chaige upon A 7 otes. It involves particularly the commissioning of two , p , His Maiesty’s ships “ Alert ” and “ Odm, which have been kept m reserve since 1904 and the upkeep of these ve^sselsMurmg their special service in the Persian Gulf. In addition the East Indies Squadron has been comparatively recently reinforced by H.M.S Ihilomel ? ow i g mainly to the demands for the constant presence of His Majesty s ships in the Persian Gulf. Moreover a considerable^ expenditure m coal, special fittings for ships working in the Persian Gulf, Ac,, will Pave to he incurred before the two extra ships arrive on the station. 11. A rough calculation has, however, been made, offithe basis of the subsidised ships, in respect of the three additional ships ‘ Philomel, “ Odin ” and “ Alert,” and it is estimated that, excluding the expense previously referred to, the extra cost for the year would amount to 84,000Z. ^ My Lords do not admit the contention of the Government ol India that this charge should, in_ accordance with the report of the Koya Commission on Indian Expenditure, he borne by Imperial 4 unds, as in their opinion it is very largely, if not entirely, a matter concerning the administration of the Government of India, and they propose, accordingly, to make a claim for the repayment of the same from Indian Funds. .

The Commander-in-Chief has requested that immediate steps may be taken to hire eight steam launches, as proposed in paragraph 5 of Admiralty letter of the 2nd instant, as it appears that caravans will probably be collected earlier this year than formerly, and the busiest part of the season will now commence.

With reference to your letter of the 2nd December last, M. 01,101, 1 am directed to sav that in the circumstances the Secretary of State in Council is prepared to bear the extra expenditure involved m the blockade.

With reference to your letter of 13th April last I am com manded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you that they note that the Secretary of State for India in Council is prepared to bear tire extra expenditure involved m tire blockade in the Persian Gulf, and that they consider that this expenditure should be estimated on the following basis : (a) Tire Government of India to bear the cost of running and maintaining the three ships “ Philomel, ‘ Odin, and “Alert,” including full pay, wages, and liability for non- effective charges of ships’ complements; also depreciation of hulls, machinery, boilers, and armaments. As stated in Admiralty letter M. 01,161, of 2nd December, the “Philomel” wms added to the station owing mainly to the demands for the constant presence of His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf, and it was necessary to replace her on the Mediterranean Station by commissioning another ship, the “ Medea.” It is considered that in her case the cost should be reckoned from the 3rd November 1909, the date of her arrival in the Persian Gulf. The “ Odin ” and “ Alert ” were specially commissioned for the blockade, and their cost should be reckoned from the dates of commissioning at Cape Town and Bermuda respectively, viz., “Odin,” 11th January 1910; “Alert,’’ 15th February 1910; excluding, in the case of the “Alert ” the cost incurred during the period 29th March to 25th May■IB T' when the vessel was detached on service between Aden and Berbera. In the case of “ Odin ” and “ Alert ” all charges tor special fittings for ships working in the Persian Gulf also ^ * :)0rne ^7 the Government of India. (6) The Government of India to bear the whole cost of the hire running and manning of eight steam launches, the Roval Indian Marine depot ship, and “ Whimbrel.” The charge nndei this head would include passage expenses (out and home) and expense of full pay, wages, and allowances (but not non-ellective charges) in respect of naval officers sent out from England for the eight launches, crews sent out for four launches, and signal racings sent out for the depot ship and oardmge.” No charge would be made in respect of full pay, wages, ^ 0 ., of those naval ranks and ratings who were not specially sent out for the purpose of maiming the launches, inasmuch as no extra expense would be entailed if such ratings be drawn from ships on the station. (c) The Government of India to bear the whole cost in respect of the “ Hardinge.” 2. The blockade will probably be found to have involved considerable extra cost in respect of coal consumed by the other ships of the squadron (“Hyacinth,” “Fox,” “Perseus,” and “Proserpine,”) and additional wear and tear to their machinery caused by continuous cruising. Their Lordships are prepared, however, to accept this cost as a charge to Naval Votes, provided that the proposals at (a), (6), and (c) are also accepted. 3. I am to request the concurrence of the Secretary of State in the above proposals in order that a claim may be made out accordingly for the whole period over which the blockade has extended. It is noted in this connection that, although formally sanctioned till the 30th April, the blockade has remained in operation till now, and the Government of India in their telegram of 7th June recommend its continuance until December next.

In this telegram the Government of India ash for sanction to the continuance of the naval blockade till December next* when they propose to reviexo the position again. The blockade has so far resulted in the capture of about 12*000 rifles (since November last) and a large amount of ammunition, and its effect on the t^ade has undoubtedly been great. There seems force in the contention that* so far as the trade is concerned* there should be no relaxation of effort* and so far as the negotiations with France are concerned* it is clear ; that our position will be stronger if we show that vie can secure by oux own action the extinction of the trade that the French are being asked to disavow. As regards the cost of the present proposals, i the telegram of the Government of India gives no fresh estimates. x The original plan was to employ 3 additional B. N. ships (as well as 3 subsidised vessels* 2 B.I.N. /% vessels* i.e. a transport and a depot ship* and 8 launches) f and it was on this basis of 3 additional ships that the Government of India founded their x estimate for a 12 months' blockade of £249*980.

For the reasons stated in the letter to the Foreign Office of which a copy is enclosed, Vis count Morley would propose,subject to the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and Secretary Sir E.Grey,to approve the recommendations made in the telegram, of the Government of India,From Viceroy, 7th June 4910. Foreign, Secret. Persian Gulf Arms Traffic. We understand from correspondence ending with your telegram of 21st March, that the con tinuance of blockade throughout the summer already has your general approval, but in view of your telegram dated 22nd February dealing with Marine Estimates, and India Office letter to the Admiralty of 13th April, we }&gt;on tyo think it necessary to ask your specific sanction. We have again reviewed ^ y ir . position and consulted Admiral, who telegraphs on 28th May :— It is my strong opinion that the arms traffic operations should bei continued. The idea evidently prevails among the Afghans that as the hoO 12 JijMiqi a weather progresses we shall relax our efforts ; and unless stringency of the ' blockade is kept up stores of arms which have not yet been carried over will during the summer be_ conveyed across and kept in safe custody in the mountains on the Persian side till they can be taken away in the autumn when the Afghans return. The last captures have amounted to 4,400 rifles and pistols, and approximately 1^ million rounds of ammunition. Effect of these captures has been very great, but we must not let it be supposed that we think that we have done enough if we wish to reap the disciplinary effect of these captures. Over and above two efficient subsidised war vessels, the Royal Indian Marine S.S. ‘ Minto,’ and the eight launches, I propose to employ on the blockade during the first half of June five ships ; three ships during the second half of June and in July; two in August, three during September and October, and four or five during November, according as the situation develops. I further propose that full garrisons at Jask and Charbar be retained during June and then consider the question as to their withdrawal. By that time it will become evident as to whether there is a sufficient probability of their services during the three following months being required.” We entirely concur with Admiral’s opinion, and request sanction to continuance of blockade till December next, when we propose to review position again. cp .

Admfra and Cox uige, and we agree, that we should now concentrate all our efforts upon the maintenance of effective blockade on Persian coast. This would be greatly promoted by temporary installation of wireless telegraphy at Bebai, Bahrein and Bushire. We could then leave Maskat entirely alone e nd Simply deal with dhows in Persian waters or with cargoes when landed’ oui system of intelligence being now sc good. (In this way, by acting as ° f 1 ers,a m stopping the import of arms under the Agreement of 169 1 and not acting [? soj for our own benefit, we should avoid international complications with France or other Powers). 01 PobHciV 1 ^ 8 reg “ds re-assuring SuUan. All that seems necessary is that ohtical Office! s should watch his attitude and just give him sufficient comfort to keep him from intriguing with France or Germany. We think no definite sum should be promised or mentioned to him. For the present Coy might simpiy tell him verbally when he passes through Maskat that we are obliged to persevere with extermination of trade on Persian coast, but will not allow him to be ruined m the process. We are altogether against giviim compensation o arms dealers. On full consideration we consider political advantages of the above course to be so great that we trust you will concur in its adoption. Admiral will reduce cost of operations to the utmost, and considerable reduction will be possible both during height of hot season and as trade becomes gradually attenuated by our operations. Incidentally the blockade operations are greatly promoting our influence and strengthening our hands in the Gulf generally. * 8 ^ Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 21st March 1910.

Government of India sanction blockade on lines originally proposed by you, including use of eight launches, but in view ot serious financial position here desire to know whether you could not carry out operations effectively without reducing troops but without emplovino- transport ship(s) which is very costly. As regards disposal of arms, please see telegram from Secretary of State ofrlst January. Please arrange to destroy arms and ammunition captured on ‘ Khaim’* No mention should be made of Somaliland in connection with movements of troops. McMahon has ordered Mekran levies to cooperate with navy and warned Iribes on British Beluchistan coast. As regards rumour of reported attacks on Charbar, Government of India must leave it to local naval authorities in communication with officer commanding troops on spot to take necessary action, but raid inland should be limited to purpose of seizing arms stored in villages. Afghans should not be attacked unless they are engaged m removing arms or actually threatening Jask or Charbar. The whole position must be reviewed in April owing to pressure of financial situation, and Government of India are confident that Your Excellency will exercise every economy compatible with efficiency.” Orders have been communicated to Political Agent, Maskat, in terms of your telegram of 1 st instant, but, pending further instructions from you, we have withheld order as to communication to Sultan about his not suffering pecuniarily. In view of possibility of large claims we trust this question may lie over. Sultan is clearly conniving at traffic, and has not acted up to his promises. Meanwhile, Political Agent has been instructed that, if Sultan himself refers to the subject, he should be told that the question of pecuniary loss will be referred to Government of India. About 3,000 hollow - 303 bullets were found in Afghan cargo captured last March, and about 3,500 expanding bullets have been found in this season’s captures.

From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 1st January 1910. Foreign Secret. Your Foreign Secret telegram of 27th December. Arms traffic. It is very undesirable to raise large general question, either with Persian Government, who have so far made no claim under agreement to confiscated cargoes, or with Sultan of Muscat whose attitude is likely to be difficult. It seems better to deal with each case on its merits as it arises. In case of “ Badil ” and similar cases Sultan should be informed that we are prepared to give arms to him eventually, but in meantime will keep them for him until we are satisfied that there is no chance of their returning to dealers. In case of “ Khairi ” and similar cases he should be informed that his claim is untenable and cargo should be destroyed. When a dhow is captured in Muscat waters and her papers are in order, but there are good primd facie grounds for believing that she is engaged in illegitimate traffic, she may be detained pending further enquiry, Sultan being at once informed ; if result of enquiry satisfactory she must be released, if not cargo may be retained for eventual restoration to Sultan. Similar procedure should be followed with Muscat dhows captured outside Muscat waters if circumstances make destruction unadvisable. In dealing with Sultan it should be explained to him that our intention is not to make him suffer pecuniarily. Would it be possible to persuade Nejd chief to prohibit import of arms ? This would close whole coast of Gulf outside Oman. Question of blockade is being considered with all possible speed. Expenditure is very heavy. Presume you are satisfied that hire of launches is essential if blockade is to inflict sufficient loss on traders to check trade. If not, this part of programme might be abandoned. Meanwhile, Somaliland should not be mentioned in connection with any possible movementment of troops for blockade.

Admiral Slade points out that the regulations of 1905, which repeal those of 1899, and also those of 1803, entitled the “ Somaliland Fire-arms Amendment No. 2,” contain no mention of the reciprocal powers of visit, search, and seizure, granted to officers of British and Italian men-of-war in respect of vessels suspected of being engaged in the arms traffic. It cannot be traced in this department whether the regulations of 1903, which conferred these powers, have been re-enacted in some other form, or, if not, why they have been abolished. ARMS TRAFFIC.

WITH reference to East Indies letter of the 11th ultimo, relative to the traffic in arms, be pleased to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the annexed copy of a memorandum addressed to the officers commanding the ships on this station, enclosing a statement showing the powers possessed by His Majesty’s ships for exercising the right of search and detention of vessels engaged in the arms traffic. 2 . I am aware that under the proclamations ot the Sultan of Muscat of the 13th January, 1898, and the 17th October, 1903, to which reference is made in Admiralty letters of the 25th March, 1901, of the 16th February, 1904, and of the 29th January, 1904, dhows engaged in illegally exporting arms or ammunition in Oman waters, and Muscat dhows so employed upon the high seas, are confiscated with the arms and ammunition on board for the Sultan of Muscat. Similarly, under the agreement with Persia, dated the 18th December, 1897, to which reference is made in Admiralty letter of the 25th March, 1901, arms and ammunition seized in Persian waters or from Petsian vessels on the high seas are confiscated for the Persian Government. It will be seen, however, that I have given orders that for the present all these vessels, except native craft taken in Muscat waters, are to be detained pending instructions. The whole of the conditions governing this trade are now so different to what they were at the time of issue of the original orders, and the suppression of the arms traffic appears to be of such importance to the Empire, that it is most necessary to take all the steps in our power to prevent the arms, ammunition, and the dhows carrying them, from finding their way back to Muscat or Persia, after having been once captured. I would urge that if the consent of the Sultan and of the Shah is necessary before the dhows in question can be brought to Karachi for adjudication, such consent should be obtained forthwith. 3. In connection with the question of the proclamation of the Sultan of Muscat, dated the 13th January, 1898, and the agreement with Persia, dated the 18th December, 1897, I would observe that copies of these documents are not among the records of this station, and I would ask for the supply of four copies of each, to enable the senior officers’ boxes also to be provided with copies. 4. With refereuce to Admiralty letter of the 20th December, 1907, forwarding correspondence in which are printed the “ Somaliland Fire-arms Regulations, 1905,” which repeal the “ Somaliland Fire-arms Regulations, 1899,” and also, inter alia, the Somaliland Fire-arms Amendment (No. 2 ) Regulations, 1903,” it is noticed that the 1905 regulations omit any mention of pownrs being granted to Italian men-of-war. The 1903 regulations contained a clause granting to the captain and officers of any Italian man-of-war the same powers as are granted to the captain and officers of any British man-of-war in regard to the visit, search, and seizure of vessels suspected of being engaged in the traffic in arms in the territorial waters of British Somaliland, and. it would seem to be a question for consideration whether a similar clause should be introduced into the present regulations.

However desirable, in order to strengthen our representations to Sultan of Muscat,, it might be that the Persian Government should be induced to forego its rights, present method of dealing with arms, &amp;c., seized within Persian jurisdiction does not appear to me to be in itself likely to militate against effective working of proposed blockade. Argument that the desired concession on the part of Persia would strengthen our case with Muscat would not carry much weight, I fear, with the Medjliss, and I have little hope of inducing the Persian Government to consent to any step which could be inter preted as a further surrender of their sovereign rights.

Arms traffic. Your secret telegrams of 6 th, 16th, and 18th December. We have considered whole case in Council and hold that it would be useless to undertake costly blockade scheme as long as the present arrangements with Persia and Maskat as to disposal of captures continue. If these arrangements can be improved as proposed below, we are in favour of adopting Admiralty scheme supplemented by Naval Commander-in-Chief’s proposal to employ troops to strengthen landing parties for seizure of arms stored in villages. Following summary of present position is submitted in support of our view. On 5 th November H.M.S. “ Fox ” captured a dhow named “ Badil ” in Lima Bay, on Oman coast, with about 1,300 rifles, and 119,000 rounds of ammunition, valued at local Maskat rates at Rs. [? 56,515]. Dhow flew no flag; crew deserted, and no papers were found on board. “ Badil ” is a Persian dhow, and arms were consigned to Barhatkh, Chief of Biyaban coast. Dhow was left at Lima Bay, in charge of local Sheikh, who allowed it to go away. Arms and ammunition were taken on board “ Fox ” and are still there. Holland reports that Sultan of Maskat claims return of arms on ground that seizure within his limits was [? improper] as the “Badil” had a pass on board at time of seizure which, if found, would prove that arms were not intended for export to Persian territory. In a telegram of 13th December Holland further reports that Sultan is pressing for a reply ; that he is exasperated at delay in returning arms, and regards their detention as an insult to his authority as a ruler ; and that arms merchants have requested French Consul to procure intervention of French Govern ment against the confiscation of arms in Maskat territorial waters. On the 17th December Holland further telegraphed that merchants had represented to French Government that British repressive measures exercise depressing influence on general arms trade which they understood to be free. There is good reason to believe that Sultan’s statement as to “ Badil ” being in posses sion of a pass is untrue. Had such existed there would have been no reason for flight of crew. Sultan is evidently an active accomplice of arms traders in spite of his proclamation and notification of 13th January 1898, in latter of which he promised to give every assistance in suppressing the arms trade, vide enclosure of our Secret Despatch No. 28, dated 10 th February 1898. It is important to remember that neither France nor America protested against proclamation as infringement of their treaties. Not only is Sultan’s complicity evinced by his attitude in present case, hut there is a consensus of opinion that any arms restored by us to Sultan would find their way back to the owner. As further evidencing the encouragement given to the trade by the Sultan attention is specially invited to his proceedings in granting permits to exporters to send arms to Maskat; vide six year’s permit given in August 1908 to Messrs. Laubenberg. Enclosure of our Secret Despatch No. 135, dated 2 nd September last. In view of heavy expenditure and trouble entailed on us in policing the Gulf and in endeavouring to suppress arms traffic—endeavours in which Sultan is pledged to join—we have reasonable right to destroy captured consignments, and we would earnestly urge a reconsideration of policy laid down in paragraph 3 of Lord G. Hamilton’s Secret Despatch No. 28, dated 9th November 1900. In the present disordered state of Persia it is to be presumed that the Persian Government is interested in preventing the importation of arms contrary to law, and we would urge that they should be pressed to give us the.right to destroy such captured.arms and ammunition as under existing arrangements are made over to them. If Persia’s agreement to this can be“ 1^ i foreign secret telegrams. Secret Department. secured strong pressure might then be brought to bear upon the Sultan of Maskat and we might insist on his granting us the right to destroy arms and ammunition consigned to Persia or India. The alternative to give to the Sultan an increase to his subsidy to secure his active co-operation does no commend itself to us. He is unreliable, and on this point we concur in the view expressed by Major Cox in letter of 25th April last; see enclosure o Secret Despatch dated 2nd September last , , ftnH k We earnestly hope that course proposed above will commend itself to His Majesty’s Government. Tribesmen from all parts of our border now fi them way to the Gulf to take part m the profitable trade, and if, owing inability to obtain the right to destroy captured arms-an essential condition in our opinion—we are compelled to withdraw blockade, apart fiom the ns at Jask and Charbar, we run grave risk of loss of prestige throughout frontier fs gTving way to a few gun runners. On the ground of our paramount interest m Maskat, our necessities, and, above all, the Sultan s active assist ance to “nns traders, and his failure to fulfil his promise to assist us, we tnlcp a his'li hand with the Sultan. 3^1= rrr:-feS— tekenritoid^ing dir pJKekrau tribes who “'p^rr^fsimitf qutdon raised above, we propose to retain arms caDtured on “ Badil.” Arms seized early in December on higti seas on two Maskat dhows carrying no flags or papers have been sunk m deep waten In another case an objection has been raised by Suita ■ - Dppeinher the “ Fox ” captured on high seas a tersian dhow, the KPani, manned lay Persians, carrying 500 rifles and cup r. arr ied no flao- or papers, but had a pass flora Sultan hoi g _g territorial waters onto.

From— Rear Admiral E. W. Slade, Commander-in-Chief, His Majesty's Ships, East Indies Squadron, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. A?, 3o. With reference to previous corrrspondence on the subject of the Traffic in Arms in the Persian Gulf, be pleased to lay the following remarks before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council. 2. From information received both this year and last year it appears that the arms which are landed on the Persian Coast are never taken far inland at once, but are stored in the villages within a few miles of the places at which they are disembarked. I have information at the present moment of the whereabouts of some 6,000 rifles and corresponding ammunition, which is all within easy reach of the coast, and I would suggest that I may be allowed to land men to seize them. (-hUa tts °^ y tL 3. The traders all have the idea that from the moment the arms are landed we cannot touch them, and that they are from that time safe from us. This fact perhaps renders them more careless in the matter of storing and hiding the arms than they would otherwise be. However, in one case at least last year they are said to have resisted by force the attempt of the Persian Customs authorities to look for arms. It is probable that the difficulties of transport will always prevent the traders from removing the arms very far inland before the arrival of the camels. It is thus likely that, provided we have good intelligence, we shall be able to capture any consignment that may escape our boats and ships, provided that we have the men at hand to follow the cargo up very soon after we hear of it being landed. 4. To attempt to stop this trade by means of purely naval operations only is like fighting with one hand tied behind one’s back. To exert our full strength and to make the utmost use of our sea power, we ought to follow up the opera tions afloat by action on shore, so as to ensure that any cargoes which escape our boats shall eventually fall into our hands. Such a force can be of small size, because it will be endowed with such mobility on account of the ease with which it can be moved from point to point along the coast that it will be impossible for the natives to make any effective combination against it. It can be at one place at sunset and suddenly appear at another 150 miles away on the following morning. The coastal tribes would never feel safe from it, and if instant retribution were exacted, directly it was known that arms were stored in any village, it is probable that little encouragement would be given by the local chiefs to the visits of the arms traders. 5. It may be possible to utilise the crews of the ships maintaining the watch on the coast for this purpose, but it will entail very severe work on both officers and men unless they are re-inforced. In old days it was frequently the custom to embark troops to do this work, and our present Corps of Royal Marines are the remains of that system. In any landing operations the marines from the ships would form a very import ant part of the force, and 1 would suggest for the consideration of the Government of India that we should revert to a very old custom and re-inforce the marines by troops embarked for this purpose. In order to preserve its character of being a naval force, sailors would always form part of it, so that it would not appear to be a military column landed. 6 . In this climate it is not advisable to unduly crowd the men in any one ship, and I would therefore propose that the suggested re-inforcement should be embarked in a separate ship to be taken up and fitted as a Transport for that purpose. This would not necessarily invalidate the idea that these men form part of a naval force, because they would be under the direct command and authority of the Senior Naval Officer on the spot. 7. No occupation of Persian Territory would be involved, for I do not propose to do more than raid any village in which arms are stored, or followup any cargo which has been landed so as to seize the arms and ammunition, and then to re-embark the men at once. The utmost time that they would be on shore would probably not exceed two or three days. 8. If this proposition be approved in principle, I would submit that I may be placed in communication with the military advisers to the Government of v India, in order that we may work out the details of the force required. Then by the time the decision of the Secretary of State is known, we shall be ready to proceed without delay. 9. I would further submit that it is all important that whatever is done should be kept absolutely secret. I would therefore suggest that when the expedition is being prepared, it should be publicly announced that it is being fitted out as a re-inforcement for Somaliland. Events there will give colour to the statement, and if care be taken that all orders given with regard to the expedition speak of it as being destined for the Somali Coast, I think that the deception will be complete. No one need know its real destination, except a very few responsible officers in high positions. It is probable that the details of the force required for Somaliland and that required for the Persian Gulf are so similar, that no information would be gained from the equipment of the expedition. The Transport would leave Bombay, when ready, with sealed orders, and would proceed in accordance with them, after clearing the land. 10. I would propose to fit the Transport with wireless telegraphy, so as to enable her to keep out of sight of land and still to receive her orders where to go. It is also very necessary to install a wireless telegraphy station at Jashk as soon as possible, A wireless telegraphy station will practically mean the addition of another ship to the effective naval force, as I shall not then be obliged to retain a ship at the cable head for the purpose of transmitting information. ~ 11. As the success of these operations will depend very largely on the reliability of the intelligence received, it is most necessary that a thoroughly qualified Intelligence Officer should be at Jashk to organise this service, °and I would suggest that he be sent there immediately, so as to prepare the * way. Even if the shore operations are not eventually sanctioned, the Intelligence Officer will add largely to the chances of the success of the naval plans by giving timely information of the spots at which it is intended to run ’the cargoes. - h°P e i n course of the next few months to extend the telegraph facilities to the westward of Jashk by the erection of two portable wireless installations, which the Admiralty inform me will be sent to this station as soon as they are received from the contractors.1 - — X’ /&amp; f,y L 71 nr- jury. No. 955—2-P., dated Peshawar, the 15th November From—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Geoege Roos-Keppel, K.C Aofent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter No. 1, dated the 11th Novemher, from Mr. Gregson who has been placed on deputation in connection with the illicit import of arms by Ghilzais. At this early stage Mr. Gregson is unable to formulate definitely the shape which his operations will take, hut the lines indicated by him appear to be generally sound. To obviate the difficulty mentioned by Mr. Gregson of his working in four different Administrations, I would suggest that he work directly under the orders of the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, who would be able to issue to the Administrations concerned any direc tions necessary. Local officers in this Province have already been directed to afford every assistance. Mr. Gregson might report and correspond direct with the Foreign Office. It will he necessary for Mr Gregson to have a small staff costing approxi mately Its. 150 per month, hut he will iu the main use tae staff of officers of the Criminal Investigation Department which is already engaged on this work. No large extra expense will thus he incurred, hut it will of course he necessary to pay informers. Mr. Gregson has asked that a permanent advance of Its. 2,000 be placed at his disposal. I w 7 ould recommend this and suggest that detailed contingent hills he adjusted monthly by Mr. Gregson direct with the Foreign Office. As a temporary measure, I have supplied him with Rs. 2,000 from my own contingent grant which he will refund on receipt of the advance asked for. I would recommend that Mr. Gregson, while on deputation, should receive an allowance of Rs. 10 per day as the work, necessitating constant travelling, will he most arduous. It is impossible at present to predict the period for which Mr. Gresrson’s deputation will last, hut the Foreign Office being in receipt of Mr. Gregson’s reports will be able to judge of the utility of the work and the period for which it should continue. No. 1, dated the 11th November 1909. Prom—E. G. Gregson, Esq., Officer on Special Duty, To—The Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. I have the honour to report that I have proceeded on deputation to Dera Ismail Khan in connection with the measures to prevent the Ghilzais from proceeding to the Gulf. I propose making enquiries here as to who of the leading traders in arms are still in the district and who have already left for the Gulf. Where evidence exists of the undoubted intention of persons, concerned in the trade, to import arms either by having remitted money to the Gulf or otherwise, I will arrange for their arrest with the Deputy Commissioner. I propose to leave for Karachi in a few days to deal with those who have left this district for Karachi en route for the Gulf. On arrival in Karachi my enquiries will he very much of the same nature as they are here. Where I have reasonable suspicion against any Ghilzai of his having committed an offence in connection with the importation of arms from the Persian Gulf, I will arrange for his arrest and transfer to the North-West Frontier Province on a warrant issued by the Magistrate of the district concerned. The above 1 measures, I hope, will, to a considerable extent, disturb the Ghilzai community and dissuade the less daring among them from venturing to the Gulf this year.2 I shall at the same time place myself in communication with the Political Agent, Maskat, and the Political Assistant, Mekran and co-operate with these officers in intercepting smugglers from Maskat to the Mekran. In Baluchistan I shall, with the permission of the Agent to the Governor- General, render what assistance I can in arresting parties of Afndis and others who have been reported as likely to use Baluchistan as a short cut to the Gult, as they are now unable to go there via British India. t I shall in all probability have to go on to Bombay and watch that port. My operations, it will be noticed, are somewhat extensive, and under the circumstances I would ask whether the measures proposed meet with the approval of Government and that, if possible, I should have some authority to carry out this work in the four Administrations I have mentioned. It is impossible for me at present to form any idea of the probable dura tion of this work, but as I become more acquainted with facts I will report in this connection. In order to meet the immediate expenses of acquiring information I would propose that a permanent advance of two thousand rupees be placed at my disposal. I will submit detailed accounts of my expenses every month. c 11 iTelegram P., No. 8.-446, dated the 30fch November 1909.

Reference your telegram No. 33-C., dated 16th instant. Pact of the contingents in question going so far out of direct route to Gulf as Herat shows that they have been sent to escort a consignment of arms in which Afghan Government have personal interest. It is probable they have been ordered to avoid unnecessary risk, but it is not sale perhaps to reckon on this. In view of very largo numbers of trans- border tribesmen who have gone to Gulf this season and who are more ill- disposed than the ordinary Afghan gun-runners ot past seasons, our military detachments on Gulf and telegraph stations between Robat and Bam ay undoubtedly exposed to greater danger than previously Only practicable precaution I can suggest as regards latter is to concentrate telegraph employes ft Robat Nasratabad, Ispe, and Bam as much as possible and make the Persian Government send a a dkad.ment to Nasratabad as bei'o ? The military detach ments are too weak at Jask and Charbar to attempt to prevent landing ot arms without great risk and should remain concent.ated at those places unless very strongly reinforced. Unfortunately the detachment buildings atCharbar, and I think also at Jask, are open bungalows without any arrange ments for defence whatever and invite night attack. If they see any absence of proper precautions, first instinct of trans-border gun-runners will be to surprise such places and gain more arms. I would advocate round detachment quarters an entrenched perimeter which should be adequately guarded at night. It might be well to reinforce Charbar to the same strength as Jask. It would require upwards of two regiments before attempt could be made to prevent landing of arms. It seems an opportune moment for asrain impressing on Persian Government their obligations and their failure to fulfil them in the matter of arms traffic.Telegram P,, No. 1044, dated the 7th (received 8th) November 1909. * UVJ uuc vjuverumenTj or India in the Foreign Department, Simla.

She was leaking badly on arrival and part of her cargo was transferred to another dhow which was awaiting conveyance to the same coast. But at the sight of the “Fox” the second dhow, in order to save herself, returned the cargo to the first dhow quickly. I have some of the crew of the second dhow as witnesses. As neither of the two is in a fit state to tow, they are kept in charge of the headman, while the cargo and arms have been placed on board H. M.’s “Fox”. The following wire has been sent to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, in reply :— “ Your action is approved. Prize should be confiscated for the Sultan under His Highness’ proclamation of 13th January 1898 as the dhow was captured in Oman Coast.

If this be not practicable, all ammunition should be destroyed if this can be arranged.

With reference to my letter No. 1462—XIV-K. of the 11 th ultimo, sugges ting that a Colonial Court of Admiralty should he established at Karachi for dealing with dhows seized while engaged in the arms traffic, be pleased to lay before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council the annexed copy of a memorandum issued to the ships under my orders, enclos ing a statement showing the powers possessed by His Majesty’s ships for exercising the right of search and detention of vessels so engaged. 2. It will be seen that I have given orders that for the present Maskat and Persian dhows seized upon the high seas, and Persian dhows taken in Persian waters, are to he detained pending instructions. The whole of the conditions governing this trade are now so different to what they were five years ago, when the original orders were issued, and the suppression of the arms traffic appears to me to be of such supreme importance to the Indian Empire, that it is most necessary to prevent the arms, and the dhows carrying them, when captured, from finding their way back to Maskat. I would urge that if the Sultan’s consent is required before Maskat dhows taken outside the territorial waters of Oman can be brought to Karachi for adjudication, his consent should be obtained forthwith. CONEIDENTIAL GENERAL MEMORANDA. No. 48, dated the 28th October 1909. From—His Excellency Rear Admiral E. J. W. Slade, M.V.O., Naval Commander- in-Chief, East Indies Statien, To—The Captains Commanders and Officers Commanding His Majesty’s Ships employed on the East Indies Station and all others concerned. Mights of visit, search and detention. The following instructions on the rights of visit, search and detention of vessels by His Majesty’s ships are communicated for information and guidance. 2 . Under the General Act of the Brussels Conference, 1890, His Majesty’s ships are invested with the powers of visit, search and detention over vessels suspected of being engaged in, or equipped for, the slave trade, under certain conditions which are laid down in the “ Instructions to Naval Officers employed in the Suppression of the Slave Trade ” (pages 2 to 13). 3. Articles VIII to XIII of the General Act prohibit the importation of firearms and ammunition into the territories therein specified, but the Brussels''mm** - Act does not of itself confer any powers of search or detention for the enforce- mentor the articles quoted. 4. Such rights as His Majesty’s ships possess to search and detain vessels suspected of being engaged in- the arms traffic are derived from local regulations when the vessels are in British territorial waters, and from agreements made with certain Foreign States when the vessels are in their respective territorial waters. His Majesty’s ships have not authority to search upon the high seas vessels suspected of being engaged in the arms traffic in the absence of treaties with other Powers, and in the case of British vessels of an Act of the Imperial Parliament. ^ 5. The rights of His Majesty’s ships in this connection are summarised in the annexed statement./ t ^rrrr:--., No. 1462 XIV ; dated Bombay, the 22nd November 1909.

His name is Sheikh Bahman of Numsar, Lima being in his district, I asked him why the arms dhow had no crew on board ; he then said he knew nothing of any arms being in the harbour until “ Box ” was sighted, when a regular panic ensued and cases of ammunition were hastily shifted from another dhow into the arms dhow. The Nakhoda of the latter then asked to be allowed to land his cargo, but the Sheikh refused, and on “ Box ” anchoring the crew of the arms dhow ran away. 4.^ I explained to the Sheikh that the desertion of the crew was an admission of guilt on their part and told him I considered it his duty to arrest them and assist me to enquire into the case ; he promised to do his best and went ashore. 5. The empty dhow, the Husain of Kargun, was again boarded and two of the crew were found on board; they were taken to “Box” and made the following statements which they afterwards repeated on oath to the Political Resident at Maskat. 6 . The Husain arrived from Dibai on 3rd November at the same time as the arms dhow, whose name is Badil of Bunji, Nakhoda Hassan bin Hosein ; she came from Maskat, her cargo being shipped by Ali Khan, consigned to Berkat Khan, the Chief of the Biyaban Coast The Nakhoda of the Badii, find ing his dhow leaking badly, arranged with the Husain to take 30 cases of ammu nition over to the Biyaban Coast in company with the Badil, the price agreed upon for the voyage being $ 100 ; the ammunition was then transferred to the Husain, but when “ Box ” was sighted it was hurriedly taken back to the Badil. The state of the captured dhow proved this, as half the cargo was well stowed the remainder being thrown in anyhow.2 7. On 5th November I cleared the arms dhow of 132 bundles of arms and 8 0 packages of ammunition, and finding she was not in a fit condition to be towed I 'handed her over to the custody of the Sheikh, who refused to come off a°*ain ; he sent word to say he could not get the crew of the dhow and that I was to return the arms at once. He was then told to keep the dhow safely until the pleasure of the Sultan was known and “ Fox ” sailed. 8. Having informed you by telegraph of the essential details, I proceeded to Maskat where the evidence of the two men from the Husain was taken by the Acting Political Agent. I enclose the regular form as laid down in Appendix XIV S.ChB. and also a detailed statement of the arms and ammuni tion found on board.

Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, rp 0 The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. T have the honour to submit herewith copies of correspondence regarding the search of a Persian dhow named “ Badit” in Lima Bay by H M. S “Pox and the seizure of a quantity of arms and ammunition found on hoard her. 2 I considered it desirable to let ttie Sultan make the first move in the t ter as contentious issues are involved, and I have now received the enciosed ntt r from His Highness in which he argues that the seizure was improper nnd claims the return of the arms. His Highness’s argument rests on the asser- f-c d that the Nakhoda of the “Badil” was in possession of a pass which was on l ' on 1 n w at the time of seizure, and which, if found, would prove that the beard the dhow ex &gt; to persian territoiy .

S. &lt;£ Balu chistan” in 1898 the Sultan was induced to constitute a Court of Enquiry, which formally decided that the seizure had been legally effected. The Court’s _ decision was of great importance, because extraneous interests were involved mQ the seizure and several law suits arose from it. In the present case, so far as can he seen at present, no such complications are likely to ensue, but if the Government of India think it advisable to guard against the risk of future difficulties, the Sultan might be pressed to constitute a Court of Enquiry and declare the legality of the seizure before the arms are returned to him. 6 . Theoretically, we have a right to request that the Sultan should take measures to punish the persons concerned in the attempt, m accordance with the terms of his proclamation of 1898. It would, however, in my opinion be very difficult to insist on this, because the crew of the dhow have disappeared and will probably never be found, the owner of the dhow is a Persian and cannot be got at, and the Maskat seller of the arms by name Ali Musa Khan would stoutly maintain that he sold them on the distinct understanding that they were destined for Koweit. It would be impossible to disprove this. Moreover, the Sultan would be very loth to punish one of the prominent arms merchants to whom he is greatly indebted, and in my humble opinion we can hardly expect him to take action, which would be prejudicial to his own interests, unless we offer him some substantial inducement for doing so. 7. It is mortifying to have to recommend that the arms captured by one of His Majesty’s ships, after expenditure of much money, time and trouble, should be surrendered to His Highness the Sultan almost without conditions, but in view of the facts of the case and the previous orders, I do not find it possible to submit any other suggestion. 8 .

I have the honour to inform you that on anchoring in Lima Bay on the Batina Coast on the afternoon of 4th November I found a dhow anchored close to the village full of arms and ammunition, no crew, colours or papers being found on board. 2. Sheikh Bahman of Kumzar, the Chief of the district, came asked him to account for the presence of the dhow with arms, having 1 ? ae knew nothing of any arms being in the Bay “ I ox was sighted, when he states a regular panic ensued, and he then saw a lot of ammunition being transferred from another dhow to the dhow in question. The Nakhoda of the arms dhow then asked him to be allowed to land the arms, but he refused, and on the “ Fox ” anchoring he said the crew made for the hills. I pointed out to him that the desertion of the crew looked very suspicious and told him I considered it his duty to find them and assist me to enquire into the circumstances; he promised to do his best and went ashore. 3. I then boarded the empty dhow and brought off two of the crew who were found on board, and although they refused to give any off and I no crew, until theinformation I eventually got them to give me the correct version of the story. They state that the arms dhow named “ Badil” of Bunji, Nakhoda Hassan bin Hussein, arrived about the same time as they did on the evening of the 3rd instant, and that as the c Badil” was leaking badly it was arranged that 30 cases of ammunition should be transferred to their dhow, the “ Hussein” of Kargun, and that the two dhows should proceed in company to the Biyaban Coast, $100 being the amount agreed upon for the voyage. 4. On the “ Fox ” being sighted the ammunition was at once taken back to the “Badil”. The state of the latter vessel proved this as about half the cargo was well stowed and the remainder thrown in anyhow. 5. On the morning of the 5th November Sheikh Rahman sent off to say he could not get hold of any of the missing crew and refused to come off to talk the matter over or give me any information. I then took all the arms and ammunition or board the “ Fox”, and sent the dhow in to the Sheikh for safe custody, informing him that he was aiding and abetting illegal traffic by not assisting me. He sent off impertinent messages and the “ Fox ” sailed. 6 . I am instructed by the Naval Commander-in-Chief to hand over the dhow to be dealt with by His Highness the Sultan and to endeavour to arrange that the cargo be destroyed, as the proclamation of *&gt;His Highness, dated 13th January 1898 distinctly authorises British men-of-war to confiscate arms and ammunition consigned to Persian ports. Translated purport of a statement made on oath on the 9th day of November 1909 before His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, by Nakhoda Saleh bin Muhammad Isa and Khallasie Hussein bin Haidar. Our bagarah (boat) belongs to Hassan Isa Baluch resident of Kargun (in Persia). We left Kargun with a cargo of mats and wood (firewood) for Debai. We left Debai for the Batineh Coast expecting to get some freight cargo. When we were entering Lima (on the Batineh Coast) we met a bagarah also entering the port. She had a cargo of arms. The boat arrived from Maskat. We both anchored in the harbour in the evening. At night the Nakhoda of the bagarah came to us and wanted us to take 30 cases of ammunition from their boat. We consented and came to the agreement that $100 should be paid to us as freight money. We then asked them where the cargo was to be taken. They told us that it was for the Mekran Coast. That night we all slept in Him a port. At daybreak we were sorry that we shipped the 30 cases’of ammunition and asked the other Nakhoda if he will take them back. They took them back. That day we were (both boats) together at Lima till evening when H. M. S. “ Fox” arrived and seized us. We asked the khallasies of the bagarah, which shipped arms from Maskat, whose boat it was. They told us it belonged to Barkat Khan. We also asked them the name of the shippers, and they informed us that Ali Musa shipped the arms for Barkat Khan. When we first took the 30 cases from them they told us to follow their boat closely in one line and to go wherever they go. Mark of Saleh bin Muhammad Isa. Mark of Hussein bin Haidar. [Translated purport. ] Dated Maskat, the 18th November 1909 (4th A1 Kada 1327). From—His Highness the Sultan of Maekat, To The Consul, Mr. Holland, His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Maskat, After compliments .—I have the honour to represent to you that the Maskat merchants have complained to us regarding the seizure of arms this side of Rus el-Jebal by the man-of-war. The boat did not go beyond the limit which was stated in the pass (certificate of identity and permission) granted to the Nakhoda. Their trade is at a standstill in consequence of this thing which has befallen them in my jurisdiction. That boat from which the4 arms were seized was in Lima, and Nakhoda and khallasies who were with him were on the shore. The pass at the time was in the boat. They were afraid to return (to the boat) and take the pass and show it (to the man-of-war) fearing they might be caught and detained. It is not like what is rumoured that there were Afghans and other Persians in the boat and the Nakhoda and those who were with him ran away of their own accoid. I hope you will return the arms which were taken from the boat. This what has happened is a loss to my subjects and their trade will suffer. ^ There is no restriction on them and we are surprised at the new thing which has happened because it is not in accordance with the usual right justice. I expect the best from the Government. No. 1247, datad Maskat, the 21st November 1909 (7th Al Kada 1327). From—R. E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, M askat, To— His Highness Sir Saivid Faisal bin Turki, G.C.I.E., Sultan of Maskat. After compliments .—I have received and understood Your Highness’s letter regarding the seizure of arms from a dhow named Badil by TT l\,r Q in T.imn Ra v. A ecorf H. M. S. “Fox” in Lima Bay. According to the report which I have received from Captain Hunt of H. M. S. “Fox” there were no papers at all in the ^dhow when it was found, so that the information given to Your Highness regarding a pass having been left in the boat is not true. Moreover, from the evidence given by two khallasies of another dhow found in Lima harbour it appears that the arms in the dhow “Badil” were being taken to the Biyaban Coast of Persia. This is also proved by the fact that the dhow ‘•Badii” is a Persian dhow. The arms and ammunition were therefore seized by the Captain of H. M. S. “Fox” in accordance with Your Highness’s proclamation and notification of 19th Shaban 1315 A. H. (13th January 1898). I am now writing to the Political Resident at Bushire for instructions as to what should be done with the arms, and pending their arrival I would suggest for Your Highness’s consideration that the dhow “Badil” be brought from Lima to Maskat and detained here until the matter is settled. Accept an expression of my high esteem and consideration. No. 1256, dated Maskat, the 23rd November (received 1st December) 1909. From—R. E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. In accordance with the instructions which I have received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to forward herewith, for your information, a copy of letter No. 1255, dated the 23rd November 1909, which I have addressed to the Resident on the subject of the seizure of arms by H. M. S. “Fox” in Lima Bay. No. 1255, dated Maskat, the 23rd November 1909. From—R. E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my telegram No. 1246, dated the 21st November 1909, I have the houour to state that the dhow “ Badil ” was left by Captaiu Hunt of H.M.S. “ Fox ” in charge of Sheikh Rahman of Kumzar. I have asked His Highness to have the dhow brought to Maskat, but it is not very likely that she will appear.3. The enclosed list, which I have just received from Captain Hunt, o-i Te3 particulars of the rifles and ammunition seized. I have added figures showing the value of the consignment, calculated at local rates, and the total for 1 300 rifles and 119,000 rounds of ammunition comes to Rs. 56,515. His Highness the Sultan would probably be willing to accept this sum in lieu of the material but m iny respectful opinion the payment of money by us would facilitate restitution to A.li IHusa Khan, because it would be much easier for the Sultan to hand over cash to him than rides. Also I imagine that the purchase would be a bad bargain for Government since they could not dispose of the material at anything like the price given. Moreover, the rides may be expected to deteriorate from their exposure to sea air on board H. M. S. “ Fox ”. Finally I do not see that the sequestration of these individual rides would be of much advantage, since there are plenty more at present in the market and the pro curing of fresh supplies from Europe is only a matter of a few weeks. 4. In the last paragraph of Government of India telegram No. 39-C. dated 20th November 1909, it is stated that pressure may legitimately be brought to bear on the Sultan. If I am authorized to threaten the stoppage of his subsidy, it would perhaps be possible to make him jettison the ride^ and ammuninition, publicly, on taking them over from us. This success would, however, be achieved at the sacridce of our good relations with the Sultan and all sorts of complications might result. It is true that His Highness the Sultan undertook in his notidcation dated 13th January 1898 to assist us as far as possible in suppressing the arms trade with Mekran, and that he has not, as a matter of fact, fuldlled that under taking. So long, however, as His Highness reaps substantial gains from the trade I do not see that we can expect him to show any enthusiasm for our interests, which clash with his own. We can of course compel him by threats and penalties to comply with our wishes in any individual case, but we cannot by this means enlist his active and constant co-operation in the suppression of the export, which is what we want. Further, every time we force His Highness to do something which involves heavy pecuniary loss to himself we raise up a large crop of future troubles. 5. As a means of solving the difficulty, I can only repeat the suggestion which I have already submitted on several occasions, namely, that we should take the Sultan into partnership with us in this matter and pay him a monthly sum in return, for which we should have a right to demand his active assistance. 6 . A copy of this letter has been forwarded direct to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta, in accordance with your general instructions.

It is patent that these arms were seized against rules within (my) limits and the evidence of the two khallasies of the other dhow is not reliable. I have received a letter from the Sheikh of Lima, in which he informs me that the dhow which contained the seized arms has left and it is not known where she is gone. He was not a surety that the dhow should not leave. In my opinion I do not think Government will be agreeable to cause loss to m) subjects and to their trade and they should not be called upon to pay penalty as they (the boat) did not go out of the limit.— Q 3 Q s fThis Docmnent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Goverraneat] ARMS TRAFFIC.

I HAVE the honour to report that, having had information that some of the northern bays on the Batina Coast of Oman were being used by the dhows engaged in running arms on to the Biyaban Coast, I proceeded on the 4th November to Lima Bay, and when six miles off I saw two dhows close into the beach, one of which w T as surrounded by hundreds of natives. 2. On anchoring about 4 p.m. not a soul was visible, and on boarding the dhows one was found empty and the other, a baggara, was full of arms and ammunition; no crew, papers, or colours being found on board. I put a prize crew into her, pending further inquiries, and sent for the chief, who came on board and at once repudiated any knowledge of the arms. 3. His name is Sheikh Rahman, of Kumsar, Lima being in his district. I asked him why the arms dhow had no crew on board ; he then said he knew nothing of any arms being in the harbour until His Majesty’s ship “ Fox ” was sighted, when a regular panic ensued, and cases of ammunition were hastily shifted from another dhow into the arms dhow. The nakhoda of the latter then asked to be allowed to land his cargo, but the sheikh refused, and on His Majesty’s ship “ Fox ” anchoring, the crew of the arms dhow ran away. 4. I explained to the sheikh that the desertion of the crew' was an admission of guilt on their part, and told him I considered it his duty to arrest them and assist me to inquire into the case. He promised to do his best and went ashore. 5. The empty dhow, the “ Husain,” of Kargun, w-as again boarded, and two of the crew were found on board. They were taken to His Majesty’s ship “ Fox ” and made the following statement, which they afterwards repeated on oath to the political resident at Muscat. 6 . The “ Husain ” arrived from Dibai on the 3rd November at the same time as the arms dhow, whose name is “Badil,” of Bunji; nakhoda, Hassan-bin-Hosein. She came from Muscat, her cargo being shipped by Ali Khan, consigned to Barkat Khan, the chief of the Biyaban Coast, The nakhoda of the “ Badil,” finding his dhow leaking badly, arranged with the “Husain” to take thirty cases of ammunition over to the Biyaban Coast in company with the “Badil,” the price agreed upon for the voyage being 100 dollars. The ammunition was then transferred to the “ Husain,” but when His Majesty’s ship “Fox” w^as sighted it was hurriedly taken back to the “Badil.” The state of the captured dhow proved this, as half the cargo was w'ell stowed, the remainder being thrown in anyhow. 7. On the 5th November I cleared the arms dhow of 132 bundles of arms and 80 packages of ammunition, and finding she was not in a fit condition to be. towed, I handed her over to the custody of the sheikh, who refused to come off again. He sent word to say he could not get the crew of the dhow, and that I was to return the arms [2532 r —7]at once. He was then told to keep the dhow safely until the pleasure of the Sultan was known, and His Majesty’s ship “Fox’ sailed. 8 .

HMS “Fox'* at Jashk 10th November 1909. Jo. 91/80 Sir I have the honour to reeort that having had informa tion that some of the Northern Bays on the Batina Coast of Oman were being used by the dhows engaged in running arms on to the Biyaban Coast * I proceeded on 4th November to Lima Bay, and when six miles off I saw two dhows close into the beach, one of which was surrounded by hundreds of natives. 2. On anchoring about 4.0 p.a. not a soul was visible and on boarding the dhows one was found empty and the other a baggara was full of arms and ammunition, no crew, rapers or colours being fourid on board. I put a prize crew into her pending further inquiries and sent for the Chief, who came on board and at once repudiated any knowledge of the arras. 3. ilia name is Sheikh Rahman of Kumsar, Lima being in his district. I asked him why the arms dhow had no crew on board: he then said he knew nothing of any arms being in the harbour until “Fox 1 * was sighted, when a regular panic ensued and cases of ammunition were hastil/y shifted from another dhow into the arms dhow. The Nakhoda of the latter then asked to be allowed to land his cargo, but the Sheikh refused, and on ,, Pox“ anchoring the crew of the arms dhow rail away. 4. I explained to the Sheikh that the desertion of the crow was an admission of guilt on their part and told him 1 considered it his duty to arrest them and assist me to enquire into the case. He promised to do his best and f he Commander in Chief East indies Station. wentwent ashore. 5* The empty dhow, the liusain o£ Kargun, was again boarded and two of the crow were found on board, they were taken to “Fox** and made the following statement which they afterwards repeated on oath to the Political Resident at Masqat. b. The Husain arrived from Dibai on 3rd Hove ber at the same time as the arms dhow, whose name is Badil of Bun;ji, Nakhoda Hassan bin nosein: she came from Masqat, her cargo being shipped by All Khan, consigned to Barkat Khan, the Chief of the Biyaban Coast. The llakhoda of the Badil, finding his dhow leaking badly, arranged with the Musain to take 30 cases of ammunition over to the Biyaban Coast in company with the Badil, the price agreed noon for the voyage being JK100: the ammunition was then trans ferred to the Husain, but when “Fox 11 was sighted it was hurriedly taken back to the Badii. The state of the captured dhow proved this, as half the cargo was well stowed the remainder being thrown in anyhow, 7. On 5th November I cleared the arms dhow of 132 bundles of arms and 80 packages of ammunition, and finding she was not in a fit condition to be towed I handed over to the custody of the Sheikh, who refused to come off again: he sent word to say he could not get the crew of the dhow and that I was to return the arms at once, he was then told to kocp the dhow safely until the pleasure of the Sultan was known and “Pox' sailed. 8. Having informed you by telegraph of the essential details, I proceeded to Masqat where the evidence of the two men from the liusain was taken by the Acting Political Agent.

I am commanded by Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that they have given careful consideration to your letter of the 15th October last containing copy of an extract from a despatch from the Government of India on the subject of the Arms Traffic on the Persian Littoral. 2 .- My Lords recognise the serious political diffieul- r /ujJ\ ties which may have to be faced if this traffic in arms is not effectively checked, and they are, therefore, -prepared to co-operate with the Indian Government in their efforts to suppress the trade by establishing a naval blockade on the coast. 3.- For this purpose they propose to detail two additional ships, viz:- His lkjesty , s Ships 'ODIN” and 'ALERT', for service under the ortffers of the Commandor-in- Chicf on the East Indies Station. These two vessels are at present being refitted, but it is anticipated that they can both be commissioned within the present financial year, 4.- In the meantime the Comraander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station is taking steps to bring a blockade into being and by January next the four Cruisers 'FOX', 'PERSEUS', 'PROSERPINE' and 'PHILOMEL' are expected to be engaged on this work. ihe Under Secretary of State, 5.” INDIA OFFICE, S. W. 15. - The temporary increase of the East Indies Squadron will render it possible to arrange for the periodical belief of one or two ships for repair and recruiting the health of the crews^ and will enable the Coramander-in-Chief to main tain four ships continuously on blockading duties. Such a blockade should arrest fairly effectively the development of the traffic carried on by the arms-running dhows, but the efficiency of the blockade would be greatly increased if eigjit steam launches or small steamers or tugs were hired by the Indian Government at Indian ports and attached to the blockading cruisers. Ships* boats cannot catch a dhow with a fair wind and can only make captures by lying in w§it at the dhow*s destination, in which case preconcerted signals from confederates on the shore may warn hhe dhow of the danger of capture. 6 . - In addition it would be very desirable to have the co-op ration of 3 Bombay Torpedo Boats and one Royal Indian Marine ship to act as Depot ship for them, provided that these torpedo boats are in a sufficiently good seaworthy condition* If the Secretary of State agrees it is proposed that the Commander-in-Chief should be instructed to report on this ppint • 7. - I am to state with reference to your letter of the 8 th November that it is expected that one of the subsidised ships will be fitted with wireless telegraphy this financial year and the remainder as soon as practicable next financial year. Four of the six vessels which will take part in the proposed blockading operations are already fitted with wire less and orders have been given to fit the remaining two.My Lords expect, therefore, that the Secretary of State will see his way to proceed with the establishment of the wireless stations at Jask as early as possible and that the sugges tions for the increase of the Military guard there, and the appointment of a special intelligence officer will be carried out j concurrently with the establishment of the naval blockade. 8 ,- My Lords presume that not only must the blockade, in order to be effective, include the Biyaban as well as the Mekran coast, but that when those eoasts are effectively blockaded it is not improbable that the arms-running,/vessels would also attempt to run their cargoes on the coast of Beluchistan to the eastward of Gwatar. It would not be possible without altogether extravagant preparations to extend the already considerable scope of the naval opera tions, and My Lords would therefore suggest that the Indian Govemn£nt should consider the desirability of establishirg concurrently with the enforcement of the naval blockade, a militaiy coast patrol from the Persian frontier as far to the eastward as may be necessary. An organisation somewhat on the lines of the Egyptian Coast Guard would appear to meet the case. 9*- As regards e^ense, the Indian Government should, it is proposed, be directly responsible for the whole cost connected with the Torpedo Boats and the Depot Ship and the steam launches. Maxims and three pounder guns would be provided by the Admiralty. 10.- It is impracticable to estimate approximately the total additional cost of the naval operations but it will be recognised' recognised that the proposed action, if continued throughout the whole year (omitting perhaps the period of the S. W. monsoons should the state of the traffic admit of it) must entail a very considerable additional charge upon Naval Votes, It involves particularly the commissioning of two ships, His Lfeoesty 1 s Ships 'ALERT' and 'ODIN', which have been kept in reserve since 1904, and the upkeep of these vessels durirg their special service in the Persian Gulf. In addition the East Indies Squadron has be on comparatively recently reinforced by His Majesty's Ship 'PHILOMEL 11 , owing mainly to the demands for the constant presence of His Majesty's Ships in the Persian Gulf. Moreover a consider able expenditure in coal, special fittings for ships working in the Persian Gulf, etc., will have to be incurred before the two extra ships arrive on the Station. 11.- A rough calculation has, however, been made, on the basis of the subsidised ships, in respect of the three addit- { ional ships 'PHILOMEL', 'ODIN', and 'ALERT' and it is estimat ed that excluding the expense previously referred to, the extra cost for the year would amount to £84,000. My Lords do not admit the contention of the Government of India that this charge should, in accordance with the report of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, be borne by Imperial Funds, as in their opinion it is very largely, if not entirely| a matter concerning the administration of the Government of India, and they propose accordingly to make a claim for the re-payment of the same from Indian Funds, A copy of this letter has been sent to the Foreign Office. lam.

A report from Herat dated October 28th, statesft Copy From the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, To the Political Resident andH.B.M's. Con^uJ-u&amp;ij}ra 1, Sir, I have the honour to refer to Secret telegram, No. 662,dated September 10 th, 1909, on trie subject of the illicit arms traffic. 2. Daring the last month, nearly 3,000 rifles and 212,000 rounds of ammunition have been imported into Mekran, as compared with645 rifles ana of ammunition during the corresponding period last year. If smuggling continues at the present rate, the Mekran depdts, which are apparently being formed, will, in a few weeks, contain sufficient arms to satisfy Afghan caravans for the whole cold weather. Unless repressive measures are adopted at once, another season will have been lost. 3 . The presence of a single ship on the opposite coast is, as I have previously submitted, of very little use. She must return to Muscat for coal, and cargoes are timed to run across in her absence. If two or more ships are employed, operations should be continuous, or no satisfactory result can be expected. If ships are withdrawn, the smugglers take advantage of the undefended interval, and whole of the previous expenditure and efforts are rendered of no avail. 4 But apart from the immediate needs of the present, the smugglers' recent successes are full of omen for the future. The operators are evidently now prepared to run consignments across whenever tQg a \s&amp;a is suffioi ently calm, and store them at Mehran depots. Even if we inflict losses on them this cold weather, they will comfort themselves with the recollection of their September gains, and will wait until the ships are withdrawn and the coast is clear. In future, therefore, export must be regarded as not only possible but probable at any moment from the mifdle of August to the beginning of June. 5 . This complicates the prohl&amp;n considerably - If, as I imagine, the prohibition of imports at Muscat is still impracticable, it seems to me that we are bound to adopt one of two courses. We must either institute an effective sea patrol, which shall be continuous, not only during the cold weather, as originally proposed, hut throughout the year except during the height of the monsoon, and which shall last so long as the trade shows any signs of vitality: or else we must demonstrate the effectiveness of our blockade, and then while it is still in force and the iron is hot, induce the Sultan to become our ally and carry on the work for us. Unless we intend to adopt one of these two alternatives, it would be better, m my opinion, to abstain from any action^since half measures are a waste of money and merely serve to bring us into ridicule, p still respectfully adhere to the opinion which I have previously submitted, that the sedond of the two courses, although beset with difficulties, contains the possibility of success. I imagine that it would be most inconvenient for his Majesty's iovern- ment to maintain a lengthy blockade of the Coast and if so, it seems at least worth while making an experimentexperiment to see whether, after the first blow has been struck, the required pressure could be maintained by the Sultan, in return for sufficient inducement. It is, of course, impossible to say, without sounding the Sultan, whether he would be willing to enter into partnership with us on any terms which could be considered reasonable, but I still venture to think^that it would be worth while trying to I come to an arrangement with His Highness on the lines suggested in my letter No. SOOV-K, dated Hnd July, 1909. 7 . If it is admitted that the Sultan should eventually receive some increase of subsidy to compensate him for the suppression of the traffic, then it seems to me to follow logically that the concession should be so timed as to secure for us the maximum assistance from His Highness, and that it should only be granted subject to definite conditions. I do not imagine that any increase of subsidy would be sanctioned See para. 4 of Political Resident 's letter No. 1775, dated July 25th,1909.sanctioned if the Mehran export were and completely suppressed hy our own unaided efforts, hut as things stand at present, smh a contingency nay he regarded a? infinitely remote* If, at the moment when the success of our blockade operation? is demonstrated, we endeavour to treat with the Sultan hut fail to come to a reasonable arrangement, we shall, at all events, he in no position than we had not nade the attempt. On the other delay treating with His Highness involves expenditure upon the blockade,and also some risk that the impression created upon him may he dissipated, owing to the hreahdovn of our defences. 8. If it is decided not to try and secure Pulton's assistance, it seems to me that we are confronted with the necessity of either dropping all opposition to the trade, or else maintaining an expensive blockade for an indefinite period, since the are evidently now prepared to utilise to the ful any opportunities that may be afforded them by the temporary absence of ships. 9.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. EOBEIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, r&gt; Simla, the 2nd September 1909, My Lord, We have the honour to forward, for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government, copies of the correspondence cited in the accompanying list on the subject of the measures to be taken for the control of the arms traffic at Maskat in the Persian Gulf. 2. In our Secret-External despatch No. 24, dated the 21st Eebruary 1907, we drew attention to the formidable proportions which the trade in arms was assuming; we pointed out the injurious effects which were already being produced in Persian and Turkish territory; and we foreshadowed the dangerous situation which would be created on the North-West Erontier of India if the facilities which the tribesmen enjoyed for procuring modern arms and ammunition were allowed to continue unchecked. The conclusion which we then arrived at was that the Persian Government were unable to take effective action, and that the arms traffic would continue to grow unless the agreement with the Erench Government which we had advocated in our despatch No. 112, dated the 30th July 1903, should he concluded and a complete prohibition he enforced against the importation of arms and ammunition into the territories of the Sultan of Maskat. This object, we hoped, would he achieved as a result of the Arms Conference which met at Brussels in 1908. 3 . Your Lordship has now informed us that t le negotiations with France have been suspended. It is, therefore, necessary to review the situation and to examine once more the practicability of measures for the suppression of the traffic. 4. The evidence which we have been able to collect as to the course of the trade during the past two years proves that the apprehensions which we then expressed were in no way exaggerated. Not 0 'ilyhas the traffic in modern arms and ammunition with Afghanistan and the North-West frontier continued to flourish, but there has been a steady increase m the proportion of magazine rifles imported, and we have received information that recent con signments included parts of a machine gun. 5 . The most reliable figures which we have been able to obtain exhibit Year. 1906 1907 1908 Number of rifles imported into Maskat. Number of rifles exported to *Mekran. Elsewhere. 40,000 3,175 14,700 60,000 11,247 14,500 78,825 35,520 30.900 Number of rifles unaccounted for. 22,125 34,253 12 405 the Mehran coast. s ///2./o 32 The value of the imports of arms and ammunition, which in 1906-07 amounted to Us. 16,85,075, had risen in 1907-08 to Rs. 41,85,760, and these fio-ures do not take into account the considerable trade carried on clandestinely by the Sultan's officials. There is also a large stock of arms in store at Maskat ^ and there is reason to believe that some arms are concealed on the Mekran coast. 6. The results of importation on this scale have been to reduce the price of rifles on our North-West Frontier by about 50^. So steady has been the fall in price that local factories in independent territory no longer find it profitable to manufacture rifles and are closing their business. By this influx of modern rifles a serious complication has been introduced into the military and political situation in Afghanistan and on our North-West Frontier. 7. As Your Lordship is aware the present Amir has deliberately reversed the policy of his father Abdur Rahman. His Majesty, though he cannot fail to be aware of the serious risks he runs in pursuing such a policy, has taken advantage of the supplies of arms and ammunition which he can now obtain at such comparatively small cost through the Persian Gulf to re-arm his regular troops with modern rifles, and to arm his khassadars and people. He has pro moted the arms traffic by every means in his power and has afforded it financial encouragement. In August 1908 it was reported that the Amir bad granted general permission to Afghan traders to bring arms and ammunition from the Persian Gulf and had authorised advances to respectable traders for the purpose. A circular letter has been issued to all local Hakims authorising them to grant a loan to any indigent Afghan who may wish to purchase a rifle. More recently we have been told that Sardar Nasrulla Khan has been receiving our tribesmen at Jalalabad, making special arrangements for the sale of rifles to Mohmands and Afridis and telling them to proclaim far and wide that those who wish to buy good and cheap rifles should proceed to Jalalabad without delay. What motives may have actuated the Amir in this change of policy; whether or no the dis trust and suspicion engendered by the Anglo-Russian Convention has induced him to prepare for a struggle which he regards as inevitable; it is not possible to say. It is clear however that the arming of the people of Afghanistan will materially increase our difficulties in the event of armed intervention whether that be brought about by the hostility of the Amir or by anarchy arising from internal rebellion. 8. Not less serious and urgent are the difficulties which confront us in independent territory on our side of the Durand Line. The armament return of the frontier tribes for the past year (exclusive of those of Dir, Swat and Bajaur) show an increase of 26,000 rifles. In Dir, Swat and Bajaur it is estimated that, in a period of a little over a year, the tribesmen have increased their stock of rifles by 33,500, of which not less than 16,500 are said to be Martinis. Consciousness of the increased strength which superior armament affords may lead to concerted action among the tribes on a scale hitherto unknown, and, when we reflect that, in the frontier troubles in 1897-98 though the tribesmen were then comparatively badly armed and did not possess more than 40 or 50 rounds of ammunition a man, we found it necessary to mobilise nearly 7 ',000 men, we cannot but regard with apprehension the scale on which future expeditions will have to be conducted and the expenditure which will be involved when the tribes men are armed with magazine rifles and have an abundant supply of ammunition. ^ Already, it may be noted, the militia corps have lost much of the superiority which better arms and more abundant ammunition gave them in the past and which enabled them to cope successfully with raiding bands of greater numerical strength; and raiders have shown a tendency to conduct their operations with increasing boldness and in organised gangs of greater strength than hitherto. To deal with these gangs parties of 50 or 60 men have now to be sent out where 12 or 14 were formerly sufficient. 9. ^ There is a further considerable danger to‘ which the traffic in arms gives rise. Hitherto the ready market and good prices which the North-West Frontier offered led to an illicit trade in arms and ammunition from British India.^ We apprehend that the position may be reversed and the North-West 1 rentier may become a possible source from which the forces of sedition in3 ) 6 . 0 ) |liese -iiiely askat [) JbaE 1 price atier, fersei itfaE galar spro Bcial ^ inted lie ■pose, ant a lywe eiat saaii *' e&amp; ioced ale A mtiffl irciy t at iu ment Dir, p lick ribes V an a bul ibes- y oucb ^sof f 60 irffl! Vest itisb Vest a in iiiterpal India will obtain supplies of arms and ammunition. ' In this connec tion it may be noted that, on the 9th August, four tribesmen, members of a larger gang, were arrested in the Peshawar district travelling with fifteen bullocks loaded with forty rifles and over two thousand rounds of ammunition. Their destination was said to be Swat, but this movement through British territory is significant. 10. In short, a political and military situation has, in our opinion, arisen in Afghanistan and on our North-West Frontier which has upset the balance of power and constitutes a serious menace to the maintenance of peace. The gravity of the position is such as, in our judgment, to call for immediate and effective action, and we can no longer safely afford to await the uncertain issues of diplomacy. We are strongly of opinion that any reasonable means and expenditure ha ving for their aim the suppression of this traffic will not only prove economical in the end, but are imperatively demanded to avert a danger which, if permitted to increase, may seriously embarrass our position in India. 11. It remains to discuss the remedies available and whether action should be taken (a) in Afghanistan, (b) at Maskat, (c) in Persia and on the Mekran coast. 12. It will be within Your Lordship’s recollection that the question of arriv ing at an understanding with the Amir on the subject of the arms traffic formed the subject of correspondence last year in connection with the seizure of arms in the Kacha Gorge. We then expressed the opinion, in which Your Lordship agreed, that it would be impolitic to raise the question at present. There has not eince been any modification in the political situation which would dispose us to alter that opinion, nor have we any hope, in view of the attitude which the Amir has thought fit to adopt towards the arms traffic, that Fis Majesty would ever consent to an arrang3ment which would place the control of the supply of arms to Afghanistan in our hands. A solution of the problem must therefore be sought elsewhere than in Afghanistan. 13. As regards the possibility of action at Maskat we concur with Major Cox that it would be neither practical nor expedient to come to an agreement with the Sultan with the object of securing his co-operation on the lines suggested by Mr. Holland in paragraph 10 of his letter No. 3M of the 4th April 1909. The arrangement which he proposes would, in our opinion, raise more difficulties than it would settle and would not improbably be in effectual. The Sultan has apparently given licenses to import arms, for a number of years in advance, and although we shall instruct our Resident in the Gulf to bring all possible pressure to bear on him, we fear that there is little chance of his co-operating effectively with us until we have shown that we can stop the trade on the Mekran coast. 14. The possible courses that remain are military action on the Persian coast, a naval blockade, or a combination of the two. We are doubtful whether military action along the Persian littoral would yield results commensurate with the expenditure involved. Moreover such action would appear to be precluded by the conditions of the present political situation in Persia and our treaty obligations. 15. A scheme for a naval blockade has been drawn up by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief in his letter of the 7th May 1909. His Excel lency considers that an effective naval blockade can be established by a force of four 2nd or 3rd class cruisers fitted with wireless installations or, in the alter native, three 2nd or 3rd class cruisers in addition to two of the subsidised vessels*. We accept this scheme and, in view of the possibility of the services of the subsidised vessels being required elsewhere in the Gulf, we prefer the former alternative. As supplementary measures His Excellency suggests that a wireless station should be established at Jask, that the guard at the telegraph station there should be increased to a full company and that the arrangements for intelligence should be in charge of a special intelligence officer. These proposals have our full concurrence. We have on a previous occasion recom mended to His Majesty’s Government the establishment of a wireless station at Jask. In view of the fact that arms are now sent over all the year round and stored on the Mekran coast, we cannot concur, in His Excellency’s view ('/S-f/cf)4 tliat the blockade should last from January to April. We c p n ™ ler that to be effective it should be maiutained for a full year and that it should he started with the least possible delay. If! We are aware that our proposals will entail considerable expendi ture, but we consider that the cost will be in the nature of insurance against greater difficulties involving larger expenditure in the future. The capacity of Afghanistan and our tribal territory to absorb arms is almost unlimited and superior arms are constantly driving out arms of inferior calibre. We are, therefore, strongly of opinion that these proposals should be given a full trial. Although the profits of the trade are enormous, yet the risks are great, and the retail business from Maskat being carried on so largely by poor men and borrowed money, any real success should have lasting results* We shall be glad to be informed as to the probable cost of the naval operations which we recommend. In this connection we womd invite Your /j/n) Lordship’s attention to paragraph 313 of the Report of the Welby Commis- / ; s ion, from which it seems clear that the cost of any naval measures outside Li VAl. w- that the cost of any naval measures outside the fixed contribution which India now pays should fall on the Imperial Government. 17. In conclusion, we desire to ro-affirm that no really satisfactory or permanent solution of this troublesome question will be reached until we have purchased from Prance the freedom to take action at the head-quarters of the arms traffic—Maskat,—and we trust that, in view of the vital interests- involved, every effort will he made to re-open negotiations with the .trench Government. In our despatch No. 126 (Secret General}, dated 12th August 1909, we have indicated the possibility of exchange of territor y with Prance. We should not he averse to giving territory round Pondicherry to Prance, provided that the Prench Government gave us a free hand at Maskat and made - ' over Chandernagore scattered loges. We earnestly hope that His Majesty’s Government will see their way to take advantage of the present cordial relations with Prance to bring about a permanent settlement of the grave and menacing problem with which we are now confronted. We have the honour to be&gt; My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants. liv /352 List of Enclosures in Despatch No. 135 (Secret-External)* dated the 2nd September 1909, from the Government of India in the Eoreign Depart ment, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.

A No. 344 (Confidential), dated 4th April 1909, From— R. E. Holland, Esq., I.C.S., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty- Consul, Muscat, To— Major Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General, Bushire. I have the honour to address you on the subject of the illicit arms traffic. 2. Prom the point of view of the Afghan or the Indian frontier tribesman seehino 1 arms and ammunition, the western coast may now be regarded as a reservoir of supply, from which a steady filtration to the area of demand can easily be induced along the line of least resistance, that is to say, between Muscat and Mekran ports. In order to stop the filtration permanently, it is of course, necessary to dry up the source from which the reservoir is for and it is to be hoped that the deliberations of the International Conference, about to reunite in Brussels, will ultimately facilitate this. 3 But even if the Conference were, at an early date, to pave the way for the modification of the Sultan’s Treaties, so as to enable him to prohibit the import of arms into Oman, yet protracted and possibly very expensive negotia- tions would be necessary before the desired result could_be achieved, because the Sultan has given to several of the merchants here written permits to import arms into Muscat for a number of years me copy of specimen permit enclosed. come. Unless the Conference are devis- ino' means to deal with this aspect of the case, the Sultan will find it a very difficult matter to prohibit imports during the period for which any of these permits are in force. A'ain, even if the import is stopped, it is to be feared that the export to the Mekran coast, unless checked by other specially devised measures, will con tinue for some years, owing to the fact that the reservoir now contains a very large quantity of war material. At Mus- • See appendix. ^ it is computed* that stock of arms and ammunition amounts to 1 , 00,000 rifles, and it is quite possible that this is an under estimate. The British Government could, of course, empty the Muscat reservoir by tbe costly expedient of purchasing a large quantity of arms and ammunition from the Sultan for a lump sum, in addition to the yearly increase or subsidy which would, presumably, have to he paid, in any case, to His Highness as personal compensation for the cessation of import. ^ Assuming, however, that the amount of the stock to be purchased is that given above, and calculating its value roughly, at Rs. 30 per rifle, plus 100 rounds of ammunition, the total to he paid comes to Rs. 30.00,000, or £200,000, and it would seem desirable, accordingly, to exhaust all other possibilities before considering this. i liFurther even if the Muscat reservoir were emptied, there are other possible sources of supply at Bahrein and Koweit which might come mto play, if oppor- tunity served. 4 In my opinion, therefore, the British Government, if they desire to check the export of arms to the North-West Frontier before the tribes are fully armed with up-to-date weapons, must take practical measures to stop the traffic on the Mekran coast, and must bring them into force at a very early date. The obvious and best method of doing this would be by an effective system of land patrols along the Persian Mekran coast, but there are political obstacles to the adoption of this course, and only an unexpected turn of events could render it practicable. Patrol bv sea r is the next-alternative. This lias been tried continuously during the last few years, but the results achieved have been almost uniformly unsatisfactory. 5. The explanation of this is to be found, primarily, in the fact that the ships employed for the patrol have been insufficient in number and inadequate- ly equipped for the purpose for which they are required. Further, those ottoiIqViIa linvA Tippti nnsvstematically ©mployGcl* In proof of the latter statement, I would note that, since November 10th, 1908, when I ioined this appointment, that is to say during a period of less than five months, and that period the most favourable season for arms smuggling, the appointment of Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf has been he d by three different commanders, and in a few days another change will probably occur. 6 . The Senior Naval Officer is, of course, responsible for the organisation and execution of measures to check the smuggling, but e\en if the ships at his disposal were all that could he desired, I submit that it would be^ difficult for the most able and zealous officer to gain control of a critical situation, if placed in command suddenly and for a short period only. Again, even while he is in command, the Senior Naval Officer is unable to devote his whole attention to the arms traffic problem, since at any moment, the presence of himself and his ships may be required for work elsewhere in the Gulf. This factor, alone, is sufficient to disorganise any systematic attempt that might be made to cover the area of smuggling. 7. But the Senior Naval Officer’s difficulties are enhanced ten-fold by the fact that the ships provided are neither sufficient in number nor adequately equipped for the work. Since November 10 th, five ships have been on the station at different times, hut none have stayed here sufficiently long to make any serious attempt at dealing with the arms traffic. At the height of the arms running season, the “ Sphinx” and the “ Lapwing,” whose officers were familiar, from experience, with every detail of the traffic, were withdrawn from the station for annual repairs in Bombay. Por some time, the “ Bedbreast ” was the only ship employed on the Mekran coast, and as a single ship is practically useless for the patrol, she might almost as well have been elsewhere. The “ Sphinx,” the “ Lapwing ” and the “ Redbreast ” are very slow ships, and I believe they can hardly overhaul a fast dhow under favourable con ditions. Latterly, the “ Perseus,” owing to defective boilers, has been similarly handicapped. The “ Pox,” so I am informed by Captain Hunt, is unsuited in one important respect, namely, her draught, for the work required. She draws a great deal of Trater and her manoeuvring along the coast is, therefore, attended with risk, while her usefulness is impaired, owing to the fact that she is frequently unable to approach within five miles of the shore. The “ Pox ” is, however, able to extend her effective range by sending out self-contained, well armed boats, each watching a considerable stretch of coast, and to this fact her recent successes have been largely due. The ‘ c Sphinx,” the'** Lapwing ” and the “ Redbreastare unable to do this, as they are largely manned by Lascars and have not, I understand, sufficientblue-jackets to spare for sucb work. Their value, as patrollingumts, is therefore hardly greater, in each case, than one of the “ Tox’s” boats. Finally, none of these three ships is, at present, provided with wireless installation. I venture to think that, in the light of the above facts, the efforts hitherto made to check the arms traffic by sea can only be described as unsystematic, half-hearted and ineffectual, and none can wonder at the paltry results achieved. 8 I would submit that we shall not, under any conceivable conditions, be able to check the contraband traffic, until in default of a land patrol, we have a scientifically organised system of patrol by sea. If this is conceded, _ e squadron to be employed will have to be composed of sufficient ships provffie with wireless, and each able to send away three well have to be commanded by an officer appointed ad hoe, and not liable to transter or supersessZ in the middle of bis work. Eecent results seem to indicate that continuous boat cruising have to be earned out in order to secure suecess. if nkn ronceivahlv be found desirable to enlist the co-operation oi powerful chief’s on the Mekran coast, like Mir Barkat by paying them larger sums than they now receive as their share of the profits from uhe trad . not sufficiently aware of conditions prevailing on the opposite coast to be able to offer an opinion as to this. o rpi. e above-mentioned measures would, doubtless, be costly, but believe ttta mainlined by experts ^ ^ meet as an insurance for the peace of .^ “^e ^Wng included in con- that there is reason to suppose that &lt;503 n s necessary to keep siguments sent.

If so, while the strength of our own position with reference to the bultan s failure to fulfil his obligations should not be forgotten, and should even be revealed to His Hio-hness 5 at the diplomatic moment, we might perhaps be prepared to purchase his assistance in stopping the export by a temporary payment of, say, Ks. 5,000 a month. In return for this, the Sultan should be required to take measures to prevent, from June, the end of this arms season, onwards, all exports from Oman ports to the Mekran coast. It would have to be clearly understood that the arrangement was purely temporary, and that it would be abrogated by a wider and entirely independent agreement to be concluded later, if possible, for the abolition of import. 12. If the plan were adopted, no formal pronouncement or official action would be necessary on His Highness’ part, since the Notification of 1B98 is sufficiently explicit, and His Highness could easily find means of letting his change of policy he known informally. By making a private arrangement of this kind with the Sultan, we should not affect our relations with France and the other Powers represented at the Conference, since the Sultan would merely be enforcing the terms of his own orders, and the Powers who might have object ed to those orders at the time of their issue, but did not do so, are now estopped from protesting against their validity. An immediate announcement of His Highness’ intention of enforcing the terms of the Proclamation and notification would go far towards killing the export, while, on the other hand, every month’s delay means that the plans of the Afghans and others for next season’s enterprises are going forward, and large interests are being formed which it will be difficult to contend with when the actual struggle begins. If we expect His Highness’ co-operation next cold weather, it is only fair to him that he should have some time in which to warn the traders and lay his plans. 13. I do not regard this scheme as a very promising one, and there are many obstacles to its inception which would require careful handling and much thinking out. Still, we have a right to the Sultan’s assistance in this matter under the terms of his Proclamation, and it seems a pity not to try and enforce our rights. There is no doubt that, if the Sultan wanted to help us, he would be a very valuable ally, and I think there is just a chance that the plan outlined above might be feasible. # 14. The arms traffic question is a singularly difficult one to handle, since there are so many varying factors to be considered in framing any scheme, and a turn of events may, at any moment, cause the whole edifice to crumble by destroying the base on which it is constructed. But it is difficult to believe that any turn of events can alter the absolute necessity for a systematic sea patrol, and I trust you will think it desirable, once more, to recommend this in the strongest terms to the Government of India. Appendix. A secret agent who made enquiries in Muscat estimated the total quantity of rifles in stock at 2,00,000. From the figures given on pages 1 and 2 of the Report^ on the Illicit Arms Traffic, compiled in the Chief of the Staff’s Division, it will be seen that nearly 70,000 of the rifles imported between January 1st 1906 and May 31st 1908 are unaccounted for as regards their ultimate destination. Of the imports between June 1st and December 31st 1908, about 43,700 were un accounted for, while for the period January 1st to March 31st 1909, the imports have exceeded the exports, as far as onr information goes, by about 5,000 rifles. 4The total stock increase, therefore, since January 1st 1906, according to our figures, is 118 , 700 , and even if we reduce this by a quarter, on the assumption that our information regarding exports has been defective in the past, we get an unaccounted for balance of 89,025. To this must be added stock accumulated in previous years, and I think the total stock might fairly be taken to be 100 , 000 , and there is, doubtless, a corresponding quantity of ammunition at 100 rounds per rifle. I should mention, however, that an Arab merchant here, interested in the arms trade, once told me in the course of conversation, that he estimated the stock in Muscat at 40,000 or 50,000. B. E.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq_, C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. in I have the honour to refer to Maskat Agency letter No. instant, to my address, on the subject of the Arms Traffic. 344 , dated 4 th S. 1 he Political Agent has recently had an opportunity of discussing the question personally at Maskat with Lieutenant-Colonel Malleson, of the Division of the Chief of the Staff, and with Captain A. Hunt, R. N. of H. M. S “ Fox ” who is fresh from practical experience of the measures in force for suppressing the parallel traffic on the Somali Coast, He now submits comment on the existing position and makes certain suggestions for improving it. 3 . The Government of India will remember that last autumn in reply to their inquiries, Sir Henry McMahon and I both, individually, expressed the view that the measures hitherto taken had proved clearly inadequate and had failed of their object and (in my case after consultation with officers concerned in the suppression of the traffic on the spot) we submitted our separate views as to what scale of measures seemed to be needed in order to seal the Mekran Coast effectively, either by means of a sea patrol or a land cordon. His Majesty’s Government then decided, after receiving the views of the Government of India, that the comprehensive operations recommended for the sealing of the Coast, whether by cordon or blockade, were out of the question, both on financial and political grounds, and we must consequently do the best we could with the resources hitherto employed. Since then another Afghan smuggling season has come and gone and the resulting position and outlook is as set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Mr. Holland’s communication. 4 . I fear that the contingency of the complete automatic cessation of the import trade to Maskat by the abrogation of existing treaties must still be regarded as outside the pale of reasonable probability : and that being so, we are relegated to a continuance of our endeavours to grapple with the smuggling trade through Mekran. The degree of vital importance which the suppression of this Mekran traffic possesses for the Imperial Government at any particular juncture, seems to be primarily a military question in regard to which the deci sion of Government will doubtless depend upon the advice of their military advisers. I can only, with respectful urgency, endorse Mr. Holland’s recom mendation that the subject be taken into fresh consideration. When His Majesty’s Government see their way to modify the attitude indicated in Foreign Department telegram No. 8 ,- 30 , dated 28 th January 1909 , to my address, and to signify their readiness to consider proposals for the effective blockade of the Mekran Coast either by dispositions on land or operations by sea, then the accumulated information and experience regarding the traffic now available at Naval and Military head-quarters will doubtless enable those departments to arrive quickly (after a local conference if necessary) at the formulation of a scheme by which the object in view can be achieved most effectively and economically. 5 . The Political Agent’s concluding suggestion that we should pay His Highness the Sultan a special subsidy of Rs. 5,000 per month in order to secure his active co-operation in checking the export to Mekran, has had my very care ful consideration, but I am unable to avoid the conclusion that the proposal has little to recommend it, either from the point of view of political expediency or practical feasibility. Mr. Holland suggests that the Sultan should “ be required to take measures to prevent all exports from the Oman ports to the Mekran Coast;” but His Highness has absolutely no machinery for doing this effectively. It is true that his prohibition of 1898 covers such export, but the object of thatnrotiibition was rather to enable our ships to act: we never supposed that he could seal his own long line of coast against the export to Mekran, even conced- ing that the* °oo mills from Dhofar fo Ras-el-Hadd could be ehmmated as too inconvenient and remote for the traffickers to use. 6 If His Highness were in a position to prohibit all export by sea from his territory so that our ships could confiscate any dhow found wuh arms at sea even bMaskat water, it would be a different matter but he ,s precluded from doing that by the terms of Article u of the French Treaty and the French would surely be no more inclined to agree to a restriction which would affect 90 rer cent, of the whole arms imported than they are to consent to a total prohibi tion As long as the import remains legitimate there would be nothing to prevent a foreign merchant like Goguyer from receiving his consignments from the steamer into dhows in the harbour and sending the latter off to some other port • ittV/ioVi makp his head-ouarters. 7 . It is extremely galling to reflect that for the existence of this thriving traffic which has become such a menace to our interests, aad for the frustration of our efforts to suppress it, we should be directly indebted to the attitude of two potentates, the Amir and the Sultan of Maskat, with whom we have excep tionally close relations and whom we heavily subsidise ; unfortunately it is a fact with which we have to reckon. The traffic can, however, be stopped in spite of them, if Government will but pay the price and for the rest, having regard to our experience of the last few years, my view is that as long as the import into Maskat remains a legitimate trade protected by treaty, no measure for securing partial and quasi-voluntary co-operation, the execution of which rests with the ruler himself and not with us, will have any appreciable effect or will do away with the necessity of still maintaining action on the Mekran Coast. Further more from the political point of view, I am convinced that did we adopt such a course, at Maskat, the Political Agent would be under the constant necessity of coming to issue with the Sultan in order to keep him up to his bargain and enforce the measures for which we subsidised him, with the resuU that their general relations would speedily become so strained that our interests in all other questions, parochial or imperial, in which we require His Highness’s co-operation would suffer. It is for this reason I am unable to support Mr. Holland’s recommendation unless Government decide that owing to His Highness’s unsatisfactory ^ attitude in regard to this traffic, the line of policy pursued by them with Sir Seyid Faisal during the last 10 years j is to take another direction. 8 . There are one or two details of Mr. Holland’s letter which need separate comment. ( 1 ) The proposal to subsidise the Baluch Mirs for abstaining from assiting the traffic. My personal view is that this would be useless. They would take the sub sidy and still promote the traffic sub rosa and we have no means of inflicting any punishment on them if they do. (ii) The grant by His Highness the Sultan of documents to Arms Trading Firms, such as that apparently granted to Messrs. Laubenburg on 9 th August 1908 of which Mr. Holland encloses a copy. This action on the part of His Highness I consider altogether indefensible, especially as to my personal knowledge, he has been warned against it before. I have asked the Political Agent to look up the old records on this point. In the case of British firms we could presumably oblige him to cancel them, and could refuse to assist the Arms Makers to obtain redress; but if His Highness has given similar documents to foreign firms, the problem becomes a very much more difficult one.

Dated “ Hyacinth” at Bombay, the 7th May 1909. / ^ From—His Excellency Rear-Admiral Edmond J. W. Slade, Naval Commander- in-Chief, To—The Secretary of the Admiralty. Be pleased to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the following report relative to the arms traffic on the Persian Gulf Division of this Station. 2. The traffic in arms for this season has now almost ceased and the Afghan traders who are the principal purchasers of these arms have made their arrangements for next season and are now returning to their own country. There is still a certain amount of gun-running going on, but it is only in small lots, and a great deal of what is now leaving Maskat is probably going into Persia itself, where at the present moment there is a considerable demand for this form of merchandise. 3. It is not possible yet to say how many rifles and how much ammuni tion has found its way to the North-West Frontier of India, but the trade has been very brisk, and in spite of two captures, shows no signs of diminution. Information received at Maskat indeed rather points to an increase in its importance, for one of the consignments to that port from Europe includes a case of hardware which is reported to be in reality a machine gun. If this is true, it is probable that this is only the first of many, and that next season may see attempts made to run not only machine guns, but Q. F. guns as well. There is no great difficulty about doing so when once the land transport arrangements are completed. 4. It therefore seems to be more important than ever that we should take serious steps to stop this trade, or at least to render the risks so great that money will not he forthcoming to finance the adventure, and the trade will then cease in its present form. It is so lucrative an undertaking, however, that it is improbable that it will be given up altogether, but the traders will try and get it through in some other way. If we can only check it temporarily we shall have gained a great deal, and before the trade can re-establish itself on another footing we ought to he able to discover some way of dealing with it. 5. After discussion with all the leading people who are interested in its suppression, and after seeing the places where it is principally carried on, I have come to the conclusion that it is not by any means impossib e to severely check it, if not temporarily to stop it altogether, if we take the right means. 6. The majority of the large consignments are either taken up the Maskat Coast in dhows and wait in one of the numerous bays until a favour able opportunity arises for slipping across, or the arms are taken overland andshipped on board a dhow 1 ”. r f o S “^ d e e g d ( | ) 0 0 ^ t i ; to the coast and news is sent across The caravan which is to receive - - „„ the Persian side 'comes” down to the coast and news is the arms on the Pers clear It only takes a h 0 ut four hours to go across, to the dhow when the co w i n d, which enables news to be sent across ”2 tXJCSS rSSp.

The subsidised siiips are almost useless for this service , they raw too much water to do the inshore work, they are too slow for the sea work and they do not carry sufficient white men to enable them to de ach boats’to cruise. y The Lascars are quite useless when called on for this sort of work when there is any likelihood of fighting at the end of . 10 It would be quite possible to establish a blockade of the Mekran Coast, with three cruisers that would have their boats to assist them, and I feel con fident that we ought to he able to stop a large proportion of arms going through. Everv dhow approaching the coast would be searched day or night, and with an officer experienced in this sort of work to command the force, the pnce of arms on the Afghan frontier ought to rise two or three hundred per cent. The blockade should last from 1st January until the end of April. The climate at this season of the year is very good, and if it comes on to blow hard from t north-west (the prevailing quarter), the ships can pick their boats up with perfect confidence that no dhow will move until the weather moderates. 31 It must not he expected that this can be done without some fight- ins. It is probable that when they see themselves cornered they will tight hard, hut if we make up our minds to grasp the matter, if for this next season only, I feel sure that we shall so upset their arrangements that not only 1909-10, but also 1910-11, will be bad seasons for the arms’ runners. 12. The force that will he required for this service is four 2nd or 3rd class cruisers, two of which can be supplied from this station, if there is no demand for ships elsewhere, and two must be especially detailed for the work. It is necessary to have four ships for the service, so that one may always be away coaling and resting. The work will be very hard, as the ships and boa s will have to be under weigh almost continuously. 13. Another alternative is that two of the subsidised ships should have their crews temporarily completed to full complement—white crews in place o the Lascars now borne, and two subordinate or warrant officers appointed to enable them to undertake boat work. This would be less effective than the first scheme, but would not be so expensive. These two subsidised vessels would take the place of one cruiser. 14. It will be necessary that all these ships should be fitted with wireless telegraphy, and it would add greatly to the efficiency of the blockade if the Government of India would sanction and erect the proposed Wireless Station at Jask. The existence of the station would free one ship for cruising, which would otherwise be obliged to be at the cable head, in order to pass information to the ships on the blockade. 15. In order to protect the station at Jask from possible attack by the Afghan caravans or by the petty chiefs whose incomes would be reduced through the cessation of the import of arras, it would be necessary to reinforce the guard there as was done this year. There should also be a trained Intel ligence Officer at Jask, as a great deal of the success of the blockade willdepend on the intelligence which can he passed without delay to the ships. Up to the present this has been done most successfully by Mr. R. H. New, the Assistant Superintendent, Jask Sub-Division, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, hut in the event of more extended operations, it would be better to put an officer in charge of this service. I discussed the matter with Mr. New, and he quite agreed with me, saying that his duties sometimes took him away from the station just at a critical moment. It is also rather beyond his province to arrange for intelligence to the westward of Jask, where there are no telegraph lines. 16. I cannot close this report without expressing my great appreciation of the work which Mr. New has done in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic. He has organised a most excellent and reliable service of intelligence, and in so doing he has earned the ill-will of many of the petty tribes through whose territories his work extends. He has been most willing to assist us in every way, and no trouble has been too great for him to try to make the work a success.

A search of our archives shows that on 30th June 1901 in a private or demi-official letter, the text of which is not on record, Colonel Kemball, Eesident at Bushire, made some enquiry from me, then Political Agent at Maskat, in regard to a reported grant by His Highness the Sultan to °Ali Musa Khan Nuri, the Baluch arms-dealer in Maskat, of a document in which it was stated that the import of arms into Maskat was free and that Ali Musa was at liberty to import for a period of three years. Beplying on 10th July 1901 to Colonel KemhalPs reference I wrote :— “ Probably Ali Musa has made money and has now begun to stand on his own legs and has obtained this agreement from the Sultan to satisfy Dixon &amp; Co., and make them deal with him direct. “ The object of the traders is, of course, to discount the risk of the trade being prohibited within the time specified, but it seems to me very doubtful if the documents would enable them to get any compensation from the Sultan in the event of such a contingency. Malcolm and, I think, others have had a similar agreement all along. “ On getting your letter I asked Seyyid Faisal whether he had given Ali Musa such a document, and said I thought he would be wise to consult me before complying with such requests. He reminded me that he had refused Goguyer one and also the two Bussians (Leontieff and Ermtere) in consult ation with me; but that as everyone knew that Ali Musa was a regular importer from Dixon &amp; Co., he did not think that the matter was of import ance. He said that all the document said was that import of arms into Maskat was free and that the firm could import for three years. I pointed out to him that he was incurring risk by so doing and asked him not to give any without consulting me and then only for a year at a time, and he said he would not 3.

From The POLITICAL AGENT, MASKAT, To The POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Dated Simla, the 6th July 1909. Sir, I have tbe honour to refer to your letter No. 875, dated the 25th April 3909, addressed to the Government of India on the subject of the arms traffic. 2. In my letter No. 344, dated the 4th April 1909, I suggested that, in addition to organizing an effective naval blockade on the Mekran Coast, -which is essential if the arms traffic is to be stopped, it might be worth while as a supplementary measure to obtain the Sultan’s assistance and good-will by granting bim an increase to his subsidy. You were unable to support this suggestion because you considered that the Sultan had no machinery for effectively preventing exports from Oman harbours, and because he would be unable to seal his long line of coast against the smugglers. I venture to address you again on the subject, because I fear that a wrong impression as to my meaning was conveyed by a sentence in paragraph 11 of mv letter in which I proposed that, in return for the increased subsidy, the Sultan should be required to take measures to prevent all exports from Oman ports to the Mekran Coast. 3 . My idea was, not that His Highness should take active steps to blockade his own line of coast, which would be beyond the bounds of possibility, but that he should render us assistance, which would be well within his power in enforcing the blockade of the Mekran Coast. I never contemplated, as appears to have been understood by you from para graph 7 of your letter, that any co-operation by the Sultan would do away with the necessity for action by us on the Mekran Coast, so long as import continued at Maskat. 4 . I believe that, if it were made worth his while to do so, His Highness could help us very materially as regards our blockade. In the first place, the Sultan could produce a strongly deterrent effect on the Mekran trade by letting it be known locally that he was opposed to it. Maskat and Murrah are at present the sole distributing centres of arms in Oman, and as the Sultan is able to make his authority felt in this circumscribed area, it seems to me that it would be a real advantage to gain his co-operation here even if he could do nothing to help us with regard to the small ports on the coast. In order to check Mekran smugglers the Sultan would issue passes to boats carrying arms bond fide to local Oman ports or to ports in the Gulf on the Arabian Coast other than prohibited ones, and he would, by means of his numerous and efficient spies, keep us informed of the departure of boats from Maskat and Mutrah, stating whether they carried his passes or whether they bad managed to slip out without passes in defiance of his orders. I am aware that the pass system was tried with ill success on a former occasion as regards transport from Maskat to local Oman ports, but it must be remembered that the Sultan was then not with us, but against us. If he accepted an increased subsidy from us and undertook to help us in return, I believe that he would honestly do so to the best of his power. Further, it might be expected that the mere knowledge of the Sultan’s reversal of policy would have a depressing effect on the local traders and this would strengthen his hands.ow - f\ ~ # * :! . u tl . e 9eco „d place, the Sultan could help us by punishing sereTely 5 . In the secona ^ &gt; whpn we recently handed over to him the crews of dhows capture J . {{ sec i u d e d them for a month in If captivity was doubtless rendered as little irksome as ios^rthe slSe co ? 1 b® ^ e ^^®j t a ^ a g e ^Q^*’ wa g e p^udi&lt;daT &lt; to ^owf ^.Tdo^^That we could reasonably have expected him to do more. m ; n d to help us, he could easily If, on the ot “ n ni ’^ afford a wholesome example to 'thefs^FurthOT 1 as we generally know from the intelligence system on the Mekran ™mes Sultan could, on °“[ 1 I 1 i 0 ™ blockade By these means, he could manage to produce an^ffect ncrt^nfy at Maskat and Mutrah, but also at smaller ports on the coast from which dhows start. « Unt vou are further of opinion that if we made the proposed arrange- ' . , , J o.-ifan the Political Agent would be under the constant necessity Z^mlug to ssui ^h ^ s“ in order to keep him up to his bargain, with the result that general relations with His Highness would speedily become so strained that our interests in all other questions would suffer. , d TufrtLtt^r u= £ op^uCm r Ind less important matters, provided we could secure his co-operation wBlmg or unwilling, as regards the one supremely important object of our policy at Maskat, namely, the suppression of the Mekran arms traffic. ^ But I venture to believe very strongly that the anticipation would no e * on the contrary, if the Sultan entered into partnership “ hetould support t Wally to the best of his power in the manner outlined’ahove with a view to stepping the traffic. He would know that the continuance of his subsidy depended on his showing good faith and it would be the Political Agent’s part to refrain from making demands which it would obviously impossible for him to comply with. 7. There is, however, a still stronger argument than any y et P u ' forward, in favour of an arrangement with the Sultan, nai J el y&gt; that mdepen en action by us with a view to stop the Mekran traffic would have a prejudicial effect on our relations with His Highness. In the first place, if the export were abruptly stopped, the Sultan won soon lose a large portion of the revenue which he now gets from the arms traffic and he would naturally feel a grievance against us on this account. In the second place, in order to retain our friendship, he would he com pelled to incur the enmity of all the powerful private bodies interested m the arms traffic. If he failed to hack up the claims of his own subjects, they would be exasperated at the idea that their rights were being sacrificed by their ruler, and he would feel that his chances of assassination, of wtnen he is always apprehensive, were gravely increased. foreigners, like M. Goguyer, would call upon the Sultan, who has been their sleeping partner for so long, to take an active part m the defen^ ot the industry, and if he failed to comply, they would intrigue against him locally and would incite the Afghans to threaten him. In the third place, the Sultan would be exposed to diplomatic pressure from the foreign Powers interested in the arms traffic. The French Go ^ e ™’ ment having no longer so much inducement to remain neutral, would procaoiy instruct their Consul to protect vigorously the interests of French mer chants which would he injured by our aggressive action, and the Consul would, doubtless, renew con ennore the tactics of past years by which our re i with His Highness have frequently been embarrassed. The German Government which would probably he appealed to by the v Hamburg firms might conceivably regard the estrangement between the sultansmd ourselves as a favourable opportunity for securing His Highness’s signa ture to a Commercial Treaty and his consent to the appointment of a German Consul at Maskat. Our important political interests in this part of the world might thus be seriously jeopardised in consequence of our efforts to suppress the arms trade. 8 It is true that our position at Maskat is very strong at present, and that we could probably contend, even with no other weapons than we now p™ against any adverse influences that could be brought to bear on us The chief object of the Sultan’s policy is to remain on good terms with us and it is probable that rather than forfeit our friendship, he would submit to aheavy 8 loss of revenue, would endure unpopularity among h,s own subjects and would reject alike the threats and offers of other Powers. H stations with the inland tribes render his throne somewhat shaky, and he holds f ast t° the belief that so Ion*' as he acts squarely by the British Government in im- if they once gained a footing in bis countiy. . , , ,, 9 .

If it were possib e it is one of His High . similar to that in the Kowait Agreement to ff fftt we^ate nolSe to interfere in the Sultan’s internal admin,s- “ believe it would he if possible, endeavour With a View to our own interest &gt; {or th increasea subsidy, to ^ndertakeffor^himsel^ami his successors, never to conclude a Treaty With any4 otW Power than those with which he is now in treaty relations, and never to consent to the appointment of Consular or diplomatic officers at Maskat by such Powers. This would almost exclude the possibility of German intrigue which it is one of our chief objects to avoid. 12 But it may be argued that the conclusion of an arrangement of this kind would lay us open to an accusation from the French G-overnment of bavin 0, infringed the terms of the Joint Declaration of 1862 by which we mutually a^eed to respect the Sultan’s independence. It is suggested in the memorandum, dated the 22nd July 1908, by the British Plenipotentiaries to the Brussels Conference that the French might object,, under the terms of the Joint Declaration, to any increase being made in the subsidy given by us to His Highness. The French Government were, however, probably not consulted when we guaranteed the payment of the subsidy to Saiyid Turki, in 1873, subject to certain conditions, and it will perhaps be considered that the grant of a further sum to Saiyid Feysal, as compensation for the loss of income of which we indirectly deprive him, would not be an infringement of his independence. The French Government did not object to the promulgation of His High ness’s Notification and Proclamation of 1898, prohibiting the export of arms to India and Persia, and they could hardly object to the Sultan taking some measures to enforce them. 13. It would be difficult to deny that the conclusion of the proposed agreement with the Sultan regarding Treaties with other States would amount, technically, to an infringement of his independence, since it would limit his treaty-making power which is one of the rights of a sovereign ruler. As a matter of fact, however, we have always regarded the Joint Declaration of 1862 as guaranteeing to the Sultan the right to administer his own country freely, and not as referring to his external relations with foreign Powers. So small and weak a State cannot possibly be independent as regards its external relations and must hang upon some great Power. By virtue of our paramount position in Maskat and the Persian Gulf we are compelled to exercise what is to all intents and purposes a Protectorate over Maskat, so far as the Sultan’s relations with foreign Powers are concerned. As instances of this, it is only necessary to point to the Agreement of 1891, by which the Sultan undertook never to sell or cede any territory to a foreign Power other than the British Government, and to our intimation to His Highness in 1895, to the effect that His Majesty’s Government would not, in future, permit any attack upon Maskat or Mutrah. In both these cases it might have been contended by the French Government that the spirit of the Declaration of 1862 had been infrigned, but so far as I am aware, they did not do so. It will perhaps be thought that the arrangement now proposed would differ very little in character from that of 1891, and the French Govern ment would be the less likely to object to it, since it would not, in any way, affect their Treaty relations with the Sultan. Further, it is probable, in any case, that local friction will arise at Maskat with the French authorities, after the failure of the Brussels negotiations, if we take steps to suppress the Mekran arms traffic, and a slight additional cause of annoyance would, perhaps, not matter much. 14. My final recommendation, therefore, is that we should, at whatever moment seems suitable, either just before blockade operations begin, or after their effectiveness has been demonstrated, endeavour to conclude an agreement with the Sultan on the following lines :— (1) An increased subsidy to be paid to the Sultan in perpetuity so long as be fulfils the terms of the agreement, and so long as it remains in force. (2) The Sultan to render us all possible aid in stopping export of arms and ammunition to the Mekran Coast. (3) The British Government to give a formal assurance that they will prevent attacks on Maskat and Mutrah..i ■« -mwi ijpi'ii niiTrii ~^ r T 1 ' 5 ( 4 ) The British Government to declare that they do not desire to interfere in the Sultan’s internal affairs. ( 6 ) The Sultan to agree never to conclude a treaty with any other Powers than those with which he is now in Treaty relations and never to consent to the appointment of Consular or diplomatic officers at Maskathy such Powers. ( 6 ) The agreement to he subject to revision if at any time it becomes possible for the Sultan to prohibit import of arms and ammunition into Maskat by arrangement with the Powers concerned.

In his previous letter No. 344 , dated 4 th April, Mr. Holland submitted his views on the present outlook as regards the illicit Arms Traffic to the Mekran Coast, and made certain suggestions, one of which appeared to be that in addi tion to the inception of effective measures for the blockade of the Mekran Coast, either by means of our ships or by a land cordon, we should subsidise the Sultan of Maskat with an extra 5,000 rupees per mensem in return for which His Highness was to be required to prevent all exports from the Oman Coast to the Mekran Coast. I dealt with the above suggestion in paragraph 7 of my letter No. ^75 of 25 th April to your address, and may mention that in doing so I did not at all contemplate that the suggested co-operation on the part of the Sultan was intended to do away with the necessity for blockading the Mekran Coast; on the contrary, what l wished to convey was that short of complete prohibition of import, a blockade of the Mekran Coast was the only effective way of coping with the traffic, and that, supposing, as I hoped, that Government would now be prepared to face the cost of creating an effective blockade by the necessary increase in the number of ships employed, or the arrangement of a military cordon, there was no advantage to be gained by our paying the Sultan heavi y for an undertaking to apply measures on his coast which he had not the machinery to carry out effectively and which would consequently save us no portion of the necessity, or the expense, of the Mekran Coast blockade. I added an expression of the apprehension that the frequent endeavours which would be called for on the part of the Political Agent in order to keep the Sultan up to his obligations would probably bring their relations to a state of tension which would prejudice the handling of other important connections. ■ x. Mr. Holland now explains to me that he contemplated, not that the Sultan should undertake to prevent export fron^ the Oman Po “ s ^ course which he agrees is beyond His Highness s practical P 0 ' er ’,^' , that he should render us active assistance in enforcing the blockade on the Mekran Coast by specific discouragement of the Arms traders in Maskat an Mattra, in the following manner :— (i) His Highness would let it be known that he was opposed to the U Arms Traffic to Mekran. (As one means of doing so he would doubtless republish his existing prohibition). (ii) He would issue passes to boats carrying arms ^*0 t °, 1 °F a n l (U) Oman ports! or to other ports of the Gulf where no prohibition exists. ^ watcldng ”the having used nitnenu c i,; ntl _o S secret nformers against his movements of our agents and ships— as secrei uuu s own subjects, (iv) He would adequate!, paai.l. the etewa of dhowa seized by oo, a tps. &lt;•&gt; rsf reports from the Mekran Coast. I understo^ M^HoUMtd 1 to'make tn tlm^rs^bstamie^but ?v*Vas it Uhe stms /.to me much too sanguine in his expectations of the measure and results of the co-operation likely to be derived from the proposed increase of subsidy. In the first place, the present proposal makes no provision for the likely contingency of the formation of distributing depbts at other points on the Oman^ Coast by the legitimate transport thither of arms either by caravan or coasting vessels. Then, as to the effective working of the pass arrangement. It has to be remembered that we have not only to reckon with the Sultan personally in this connection, (it is quite possible that his intentions might be bona fide) but we have to count also on the co-operation of His Highness’s officials and subjects, so many of whom are directly interested in the traffic and stand to lose profit or pickings from its whole or partial suppression. Thirdly, we have the personal equation to consider, a factor which in this case affects the question greatly. I have a great personal regard for His Highness Seyyid Faisal, who possesses many good and amiable traits, but moral strength of character is not one of them. I think there can be no^ two opinions on this point, either among his own subjects or others who know him ; and even granted that at the time of his accepting the arrangement he formed an honest personal resolve to reform, and to give us his co-operation, in prder to do so in practice he would have to pursue a strong and inflexible policy with his subjects which is quite foreign to our past experience of him and to the character which I ascribe to him. Every act of specific repression undertaken on His Highness’s own initiative would bring him into sharp contact with his subjects concerned and would, I believe, deprive him of all chance of that quiet life which Mr. Holland mentions that he greatly desires. As regards adequate punishment of offenders seized by our ships, I look upon this as a measure of co-operation which we are entitled to demand as it is, without any specific inducement; and in such cases it is not really so very difficult for His Highness to comply with our views and advice because he can always plead to his own people that he is acting under pressure from us. In the instance quoted by Mr. Holland (in paragraph 10) when the Sultan released the crew of the dhow captured by H. M. S. “Fox” after a month’s easy imprisonment, the punishment in question was in my opinion quite indequate, and was only allowed to pass as a special case in deference to the Political Agent’s express representations. 4. In short, were the increase of subsidy still only advocated by Mr. Holland as an inducement to co-operation, l should feel no better able to support his recommendation than I was before. On the other hand I have always been in favour of compensating the Sultan, after the fact, as an act of friendly grace, for loss of revenue resulting to him from the elimination or suppression of the traffic, and Mr. Holland now also recommends the increase on this score, and as an item of a reciprocal agreement embracing other independent questions ('aide paragraph 14 of his letter). Of these, Item No. 5 would no doubt be a most convenient stipulation if diplomatically permissible, and in its present form would probably not raise in the Sultan’s mind any suspicion that the Declaration of 1862 was likely to be abrogated, but the general question of our assumption of his foreign relations is already under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government and this sugges tion clearly forms part of it. As regards (3). The assurance given to the Sultan in 1895 was com- • vut Maskat Annual Administration Rep o,t Ffhensively reaffirmed in public Darbar by 1503-04, pages 16.18. His Excellency Lord Curzon* during his visit to Maskat on 18th November 1903. I hardly think anything further is needed, but if the Political Agent considers that the reiteration of the assurance in the present way would be useful, there seems no objection thereto. With regard to item (4). So long as the Declaration of 1862 holds good the Sultan is properly speaking not in need of such a pronouncement from us.3 If the abrogation of that Declaration becomes possible the expediency of giving the Sultan some assurance as to our future policy would doubtless be considered but I am doubtful whether it would be timely to give it now. 5 My own inclination is in favour of first showing the Sultan that we can and will make the blockade of Mekran effectual, and then of paying him what ever seems fair, for the loss of revenue which we see resulting to him In the meanwhile it does not appear that he or Foreign Powers can make the’slightest legitimate demur to our suppressing the smuggling into Mekran, a traffic which is in the first place contraband and in the second is known to do us vital injury. If however Government consider that the importance of bringing about Item (5) of Mr. Holland’s suggested agreement makes the immediate payment of an enhanced subsidy advisable, apart from any question of effective co-operation which it is realised may or may not be received, by all means let the payment be made. Then in addition to the safeguard against introduction of German diplomatic agents Government would at all events have the possible chance of receiving genuine and effective co-operation from the Sultan and the Political Agent at the same time would enjoy the opportunity, of demonstrating how effective under his influence that co-operation could be made.

But object of visit to villages beyond the outer line must be Surictl}/ limited to arranging, for settlement of difficulties in area between the inner and outer lines. From Viceroy, ith September 1909. Foreign. Arms traffic. Please see your telegram of 29th July. The following is a summary of a Despatch which will be sent von by mail of 4th September. Our Despatch No 24, dated 21st February 1997, reviewed the probable results of allowing traffic to proceed unchecked, and advocated agreement with French Government which would enable us to control supply at Maskat. Suspension of the negotiations makes it necessary to consider necessity of other measures to check influx of modern rifles, which has assumed grave proportions, and has introduced serious complication into military and political situation in Afghanistan and in North-West Frontier. Latest figures show nearly 79,000 rifles imported into Maskat in 1908, and value of impoits rose in one year from about 1/ to 42 lakhs. In addition, there is clandestine traffic by Sultan’s officials, and large quantities of arms and ammunition are said to be stored in Maskat. Recent consignments to Maskat included paits of a machine gun. Policy of present Amir encourages whole sale armament of Afghans, which must materially increase our difficulties in event of armed intervention in Afghanistan, whether produced by hostility of ruler or internal rebellion. On North-West Frontier number of moder.t rifles in hands of tribesmen increased very largely last year. Consciousness of increased strength which superior armament affords may lead to concerted action on large scale ; and militia have already lost superiority which better arms and more abundant ammunition gave them, and have now to face raiding bands of considerable strength and emboldened by superior weapons. We also apprehend that there is danger that arms may reach revolutionaries in India. Situation is in our opinion most serious and calls for immediate and effective action. Owing to attitude of Amir no measures are practicabie in Afghanistan. Pressure can be brought to bear on Sultan of Maskat; but he has given licenses to trade for several years in advance, and will probably not co-operate effectively until we have made traffic difficult and costly. It seems impossible to expect effective help from Persian Government. Operations by Indian troops on Persian Mekran littoral seem undesirable. We therefore earnestly recommend establishment of naval blockade on lines outlined by Admiral Slade in his Despatch of (? 7th May) to Admiralty, together with necessary supplementary measures, namely, establishment of wireless installation at Jask, guard for telegraph station, and special intelligence arrangements. But blockade for a full year is necessary as arms-runners now ship arms weekly all the year round to Mekran where they are then stored. These proposals, though expensive, will prevent larger expenditure and greater danger in future. We shall be glad to have estimate of cost of naval operations, and invite attention to paragraph 313 of Welby Commission Report, from which it seems clear that cost of naval measures outside Indian fixed contribution should fall on Imperial Govern ment.; Successful blockade should deal severe blow to retail trade from Maskat, as it is carried on by poor men with borrowed capital. Finally, we suggest, as permanent solution of question, arrangement with France to get free hand at Maskat by exchange of territory, France giving up Chanderna- gore and the Loges, and being given territory round Pondicherri. @1^1 0 ^ “</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000006_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/113</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000006</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/113</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 619/1907 Pt 4 'Arms Traffic: Persian Gulf - Blockade (correspondence 1909-1911).'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1909/1911</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-09-02T13:26:52</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (378 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.The subject 619 (Arms Traffic) consists of 7 volumes, IOR/L/PS/10/110-116.
