To this end it examines the potential benefits, and who (Britain, Germany, Persia, or Russia) stands to gain/lose the most from the project; it looks into the commercial, strategic, and political implications of the railway from a British perspective. It also provides advice on the steps to be taken by the British Government depending on whether it chooses to back or oppose the scheme. Sir Arthur Hirtzel is the author of the memorandum.The appendix (folios 22-24) contains extracts on opinions concerning the Trans-Persian Railway from various authorities including: the Board of Trade; Sir Arthur Henry McMahon, Chief Commissioner of Baluchistan; Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Frederick Noel Paton, Director-General of Commercial Intelligence, India; Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig, Chief of the General Staff, India; Sir Trevredyn Rashleigh Wynne, President of the Railway Board, India; the Government of India; and Sir William Nicolson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Railways</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000116#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
