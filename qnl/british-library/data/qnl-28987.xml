Introduction. —Persia, which was formerly expansive herself at times, has been herself enclosed by other expansive Powers during the last century and a half. Nevertheless, her existing frontiers now seem to be stabilised. After the entry of British and Soviet troops into Persia in August, 1941, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and Persia signed a treaty (29th January, 1942) whereby the first two Powers recognised the integrity and inde pendence of Persia. The Declaration of Tehran (1st December, 1943) by the three great Allied leaders constituted a further guarantee of Persia’s frontiers and inde pendence (paras. 1-2). 2. Turkey .—The Turco-Persian frontier, after many infringements and modifica tions and several fruitless attempts at delimitation, was finally demarcated by an international commission in 1913-14. Turkey’s loss of Mesopotamia as a result of her defeat in the first Great War led to no more than the northern part of this frontier remaining as the border between her and Persia (paras. 3-17). 3. Iraq .—The frontier of Iraq with Persia was inherited from the Ottoman Empire. Persia recognised Iraq as an independent state in 1929, but a dispute over the Shaft al-Arab portion of the frontier persisted until 1937 (paras. 18-24). 4. The U.S.S.R .—In Transcaucasia and Azarbaijan the Russo-Persian treaties of Gulistan (1813) and Turkmanchai (1828) left Russia in possession not only of all territory to the north of the Aras, but also of some districts bordering on the Caspian Sea to the south of that river. Only a very slight modification of this frontier was afterwards made. East of the Caspian, the western half of the existing frontier was defined in 1881 and was subsequently demarcated. Slight modifications were made in 1893, when the remaining part of the frontier was defined. By the Perso- Soviet treaty of 1921 the 1881 frontier was reaffirmed, except for an adjustment in favour of Persia, but this territory does not appear to have been hai2l^l J?4?nd demarcation has yet to be completed (paras. 25-44). 5. Afghanistan .—In the XIXth century Herat and Sistan were bones of contention between Persia and Afghanistan. Largely through the intervention and mediation of Great Britain, Persian claims to Herat were withdrawn. British mediation was likewise responsible for the settlement of the Sistan controversy; in 1903-05 the MacMahon Mission defined and demar cated the frontier in this region. In 1935 a Turkish arbitrator settled a further Perso-Afghan boundary dispute and de marcated the rest of the frontier between the two Powers (paras. 45-53). 6. Baluchistan .—Persian territorial pre tensions led to continual encroachment in Baluchistan in the middle and latter half of the NJIXth century. The frontier with British India was partly defined in 1871 and mortf fully in 1896, when some demar cation was also carried out (paras. 54-60). 7. Persian Gulf .—A conflict of views between (*£fcat Britain and Persia persists in regard to certain islands in the Persian Gulf, notably the Bahrein islands. Persia held the Bahrein islands in Sasanian times and again, but only intermittently, from 1602 to 1783; in the latter year she was finally dispossessed by Arabs. Persian and Turkish claims to Bahrein have been made on numerous occasions to Great Britain, but have always been rejected. The islands of Tamb, Abu Musa, Sirri and others are also in dispute: Great Britain has never recognised Persian claims to these islands, but has acquiesced in Persian control of Sirri since 1887 (paras. 61-78). PERSIAN FRONTIERS Introduction 1. Persia, which was a very expansive country from time to time in the past, has, during the last century and a half, been herself enclosed by other expansive Powers. Nevertheless, her existing frontiers now 86-12 B2 mm appear to be stabilised, except in some relatively unimportant respects. All these frontiers have now been defined, but some demarcation yet remains to be done on (a) the Perso-Soviet border east of the Caspian Sea, and (b) the Perso-Baluch border. 2. On the 8th July, 1937, Persia signed, at Sa'dabad, near Tehran, a non-military pact of bon voisinage with Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan. Each of these four states recognised the present and future inviolability of their common frontiers, thus bringing to an end a series of long- drawn-out conflicts and controversies. On the 25th August, 1941, British and Soviet troops entered Persia; opposition was slight and short-lived, and Riza Shah soon after abdicated in favour of his son Muhammad Riza. On the 29th January, 1942, Great Britain, Soviet Russia and Persia signed a treaty whereby the two former Powers recognised the integrity and independence of Persia, while the latter, for her part, agreed to the main tenance of British and Soviet troops on Persian soil for the purpose of safe guarding lines of communication. Great Britain and the Soviet Union both under took to withdraw their forces from Persia not later than six months after the conclu sion of hostilities. The United States was not a party to this treaty, but in the “ Declaration of the Three Powers concerning Persia,” which President Roosevelt, Mr. Churchill and Marshal Stalin issued at Tehran on the 1st Decem ber, 1943, it was stated that the Govern ments of the three Great Powers were “ at one with the Government of Persia in their desire for the maintenance of the indepen dence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Persia.” The participation of the United States in this Declaration thus con stitutes a supplementary guarantee of the frontiers of Persia. I.—Frontier with Turkey 3. In the course of the last four centuries the long frontier line between Persia and Turkey has undergone many changes. Before Mesopotamia was detached from Turkey in consequence of the defeat of the latter in the War of 1914-18, the Turco- Persian frontier was some 840 miles in length, and in earlier times it had been even longer. Territorial aggression by both Persia and Turkey and acute religious differences between the two nations led to many struggles. Conflicting claims to pasture lands by nomadic tribes on each side of the border also caused frequent clashes. In consequence, border provinces and towns often changed hands, but gains by one side or the other generally proved to be only of a temporary nature. In more recent times hostilities or disputes between Turkey and Persia were usually settled, in so far as territorial questions were cerned, on the basis of the treaty of Zunab (17th May, 1639) between Sultan Murad IV of Turkey and Shah Safi of Persia. 4. The treaty of Zuhab laid down in a very approximate manner the line to be followed by the frontier from the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab to the Caucasus range. After following the Shatt for some 50 miles, the boundary struck inland and ran northwards across the plain until it reached the edge of the Persian plateau; it then skirted that plateau, leaving Badra and Mandali in Turkey. After traversing Kurdistan, the border ran generally north wards along high watersheds through very mountainous country; in the far north the mountains of Suram (Likhi) formed the boundary between Turkey and Persia, thus leaving the Georgian states of Kakheti and Kartli to Persia and Imeriti and Samtzkhe including Akhaltsikhe, which was specifi cally mentioned, to Turkey. It is to be emphasised that this frontier was never explicitly defined or delimited. 5. In the first half of the XVIIIth century the border underwent many changes. The invasion of Persia by the Ghalzai Afghans and their overthrow of the Safavi dynasty in 1722 created such chaos in the country that both Turkey and Russia seized the opportunity to annex large tracts of Persian territory. In the struggle for the spoils war very nearly broke out between the two Powers. Through French mediation, however, Turkey and Russia signed a treaty on the 23rd June, 1724, whereby the former obtained most of Luristan, Kurdistan and Azarbaijan, all Armenia and Georgia and the western portions of Shirvan and Daghistan. Russia’s share will be de scribed below (see para. 28). This arrangement was somewhat modified, in so far as Turkey was concerned, by the war which soon afterwards broke out between her and Ashraf, the Afghan ruler of Persia. Nevertheless, the treaty of Hamadan (1727) between the Turks and Afghans left the former in possession of most of what they had gained by their pact with Russia. 6. In 1730 Tahmasp Quli Khan (better known by his later title of Nadir Shah), the able and ambitious general of Shah Tahmasp II, attacked the Turks and forcedthem to relinquish Kermanshah, Hamadan and Tabriz. In 1731, when Nadir was absent in Khorasan, the Shah sought to emulate his exploits and attacked the Turks. He suffered, however, a humilia ting defeat, and lost most of the recon- q^red territory. In the course of subse quent campaigns, Nadir drove the Turks completely out of Persia and invaded lurkish soil. Both sides, however, became exhausted by the long struggle, and the treaty of Kurdan (4th September, 1746) reaffirmed the 1639 frontier. 7. The second half of the XVIIIth century saw no material changes in the frontier, but towards its close the influence of Russia became increasingly felt. Russia's occupation of Georgia in 1801 and her expansion to the west of that country considerably shortened Persia's frontier with Turkey. This frontier was again curtailed in 1828 when Persia, by the Treaty of Turkmanchai, had to cede Nakhichevan and Erivan to Russia; the northern end of the Turco-Persian frontier was then fixed on the Aras to the south east of Ararat, where the Russo-Persian border began. 8. Turkey and Persia were at war again from 1821 to 1823. Hostilities ended with the signature of the first treaty of Erzurum (28th July, 1823), which implicitly recog nised the 1639 boundary by confirming the frontier provisions of the treaty of Kurdan. As before, however, no attempt was made to define or demarcate the frontier. This lack of a specific boundary led before long to a serious recrudescence gf frontier dis putes and clashes, mainly in Kurdistan. In 1842, when Turkey and Persia seemed on the brink of war, Great Britain and Russia seemed their consent to the setting up of a joint frontier commission. The result of the labours of this commission was the signature of the second treaty of Erzurum (20th May, 1847). This instru ment reaffirmed the frontier as previously agreed, with the following exceptions :— (i) The Turkish Government expressly recognised that, as regards the Shatt al-Arab portion of the frontier, the town and anchorage of Moham- merah (now Khurramshahr), the island of Khizr (Abadan), and all lands on the eastern bank of the Shatt which belonged to Persian tribes were to be in Persia. Further more, Persian ships were to have freedom of navigation on the Shatt from its mouth to the point where the frontier struck inland from its i i. tjUJ: | dystern bank between Mohammerah and Ba sra. T-'he province of Zuhab was to be partitioned, the flat western part being assigned to Turkey, while the mountainous eastern portion, together with the Karind valley, was given to Persia. 9. The treaty also provided for the de limitation of the frontier. Persian and Turkish commissioners, with British and Russian commissioners as mediators, met at Mohammerah in 1850 and at Zuhab in the two following years, but Turkish intransigence in every case rendered agree ment impossible. In the absence of an authoritative definition of the frontier, both I urkey and Persia agreed to accept the status quo, unsatisfactory though that had proved to be. From that time on the British and Russian Commissioners strove for years to produce a map of the frontier, but it was not until 1869 that they com pleted the “Identic Map. This map, however, did not show the frontier line, but merely a zone 20 miles in width within which this line was to be traced. Another abortive attempt to delimit the frontier was made in 1874. 10. In 1878 Russia, in order to reward Persia for remaining neutral during the Russo-Turkish war, procured the insertion in the treaty of Berlin of articles which provided for the cession by Turkev to Persia of the town and district of Qotur (which are situated between lakes Van and Urmia); some years, however, elapsed before Turkey withdrew from that area. Disputes over Qotur arose in 1879-84, 1889-94 and 1905-12. These and other differences led to a fresh endeavour to obtain a properly delimited frontier. 11. In 1913-14 the Turco-Persian Fron tier Commission, on which Great Britain and Russia were also represented, carried out a complete survey and delimitation of the frontier. The final protocol was signed on the 27th October, 1914, only two days before Turkey attacked Russia. 12. In so far as Persia’s rights to the anchorage at Mohammerah were concerned, the terms of the settlement were more favourable to her than the somewhat vague provisions of the second treaty of Erzurum had been (see para. 8 above). Instead of merely specifying the anchorage at Mohammerah (which would have meant little or nothing more than the waters of the Karim river off that place), the ' Declaration between the United Kingdom b 2 86-124 and Turkey respecting the Southern Section of the Turco-Persian Frontier,” which was signed at London on the 29th July, 1913, provided, inter alia, that “ the modern port and anchorage of Moham- merah, both above and below the junction of the River Karun with the River Shatt- el-Arab, shall remain under Persian juris diction in pursuance of the Treaty of Erzeroum, but this shall not impair the right of Turkey to use that part of the river, nor shall Persian jurisdiction be extended to those parts of the river which remain outside the anchorage.” The terms of the Proces-Verbaux relating to the third meeting of the Frontier Commissioners on the 29th January, 1914, were more explicit. It was laid down therein that the frontier line was to leave the left (Persian) bank of the Shatt at Tuwaijat, 1,417 metres (4,650 feet) downstream from the left bank of the Karun river where that stream enters the Shatt, and follow the thalweg (mid-channel line) upstream past Mohammerah to a point opposite the south-eastern end of the Nahr al-Khayyin, a total distance of 4f miles. The frontier line there entered the Nahr al-Khayyin and followed its thalweg up to a point 400 feet west of the point where it is joined by the Nahr AbuJ-Arabid. From this last-mentioned point the frontier struck inland across the plains in a northerly direction until it reached the foothills of the Zagros range; it then fol lowed the eastern limits of the Mesopo tamian plain, running first north-west and then north. 13. Some 300 miles to the north-west of the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab, two terri torial adjustments in favour of Turkey were made, where two areas, afterwards known as the Transferred Territories, were allocated to her. These areas, which cover 520 and 154 square miles, lie respectively to the north-east and south-east of Khanaqin. Their importance lies chiefly in the fact that they are oil-bearing (the Naft Khaneh field, which is being exploited by the Khanaqin Oil Company, a sub sidiary of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, is situated in the southern area; at Chiah Surkh, in the northern area, oil has also been discovered, but has not yet been exploited). Furthermore, most of the Qotur district (see para. 10 above) became Turkish again. 14. After the signature of the Mudros Armistice on the 30th October, 1918, Turkey ceased to have any responsibility for Mesopotamia, which had the status of occupied enemy territory until the estab lishment of the Kingdom of Iraq. By this territorial change, which was ultimately embodied and defined in the Anglo-Turco- Iraqi treaty signed at Ankara on the 5th June, 1926, Persia’s frontier with Turkey was greatly shortened; it ran from a point 40 miles north-east of Ruwandiz (Rowanduz) along the 1914 line to the rijj^ Aras. 15. At the 1919 Peace Conference Persia laid claim to Turkish Kurdistan, Mosul and even Diyarbakir, but these extravagant pretensions were disallowed. 16. On the 23rd January, 1932, a small territorial adjustment was amicably arranged by the two Powers, whereby Turkey received Little Ararat and the Agri range in exchange for Qotur and part of Bajirga; this exchange has been described as being intended to facilitate control of the Kurdish frontier tribes. 17. The Sa'dabad Pact, which was signed on the 8th July, 1937, confirmed the then existing Turco-Persian frontier by stating (in Article 2) that the inviolability of Persian frontiers would be respected. II.—Frontier with Iraq 18. When the new state of Iraq was formed, it acquired, by inheritance from Turkey, a frontier with Persia some 550 miles long, extending from the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab in the south to a point 40 miles north-east of Ruwandiz in the north. At this latter point the Turco-Iraqi frontier, as laid down in the treaty of the 5th June, 1926 (see para. 14 above), branches off to the west, and all that remains of the Turco-Persian frontier begins. 19. Relations between Persia and Iraq were very strained for a number of years, largely because of the not unnatural dis satisfaction of the former with the Shatt al-Arab portion of the frontier. It was most galling to the nascent, but none the less very strong, nationalist spirit which the late Riza Shah so assiduously fostered in his country that the waters of the Shatt should remain (except in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah) under alien control. Per sians found it irksome that regulations for the navigation of the river were issued by the Basra Port Authority, and that vessels lying alongside the jetties of the great oil port of Abadan were in Iraqi and not Persian waters. Ships of the newly- formed Persian Navy were ordered to dis regard the navigational regulations in the Shatt, with the result that on one occasion there was nearly a serious collision between one of these warships and a British vessel. There was also some reason to believe thatPersia harboured the design of regaining the Transferred Territories with their oil fields (see para. 13 above)( 1 ). 20. Although Persia recognised Iraq officially in 1929, the dispute over the Shatt al-Arab frontier persisted, and it was not S^til the 4th July, 1937, that the two lowers signed a treaty in which it was agreed (in article 2) that the frontier should leave the most advanced point {i.e., the north-west end) of the island of Shatait (which had been allocated to Persia by the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission in 1913-14) and follow the thalweg of the stream for four and a half miles to a point oh No. 1 jetty at Abadan,( 2 ) whence it returned to the left bank of the river which it followed as before as far as Tuwaijat. In all respects the frontier remained as fixed in 1913-14. Article 3 of the treaty provided for the setting up of a joint Commission to demarcate the frontier as it had been defined in 1913 and also to fix such new frontier marks as it might con sider necessary. 21. This treaty also provided for the con clusion of a conservancy agreement. 22. While it was satisfactory that Persia and Iraq had agreed to this extent, there was, unfortunately, no time limit specified within which the conservancy agreement was to be concluded. 23. From the British point of view this treaty was unsatisfactory for several reasons. In the first place, there was the omission of the time limit mentioned above. Secondly, there was no guarantee that the conservancy agreement, in the event of it ever reaching finality, would contain adequate provisions for the maintenance of navigability in the waters ceded by Iraq to Persia. Lastly, there remained the possibility that Persia might not ade quately carry out conservancy work in her own waters; there would obviously be a likelihood of harm to British interests in the event of parts of the river channel on the Persian side of the frontier being allowed to silt up, thus causing the thalweg line to shift towards the Iraqi bank of the Shatt. 24. Nine and a half years have now elapsed since the treaty was signed, and (') This belief was later fostered by German propa ganda. trom September 1939 onwards, it was from time to time alleged, in broadcasts in Persian, that these territories had been detached from Persia because they were oil-bearing. ( 2 ) The latitude of this point is wrongly given in Foreign Office print E 4521/73/34 as 30° 28' 04' N. It should be 30 20 08• 4' N. The mistake occurred originally in the text of the treaty published in the Journal dc Tehran on 20th July, 1937. there is still no sign of the conclusion of the conservancy agreement, while Persian obstruction and procrastination have pre vented the Delimitation Commission from completing their task. III.—Frontier with the U.S.S.R. 25. Persia’s frontier with Soviet Russia is divided into two portions by the Caspian Sea. As the western stretch of this frontier is the more ancient of the two, it will be dealt with first. (i) West of the Caspian Sea 26. With two such vigorous personali ties as the Tsar Boris Godunov and Shah Abbas the Great as their respective heads, it seemed that Russia and Persia would inevitably come to blows over Daghistan, Shirvan and Georgia in the opening years of the XVIIth century. Russia made an attack on the north of Daghistan, and in 1604 sent an envoy to Georgia to demand that country’s submission, but the Tsar died in the following year, before anything tangible could result. After Boris’s death, Russia entered upon her “ Time of Troubles,” and for over a century was unable to entertain thoughts of territorial expansion in the Caucasus regions. Shah Abbas, freed from the risk of collision with Russia, succeeded in re-establishing Per sian supremacy in Georgia and Armenia, but after his death in 1628 a decline set in. 27. When the XVIIIth century dawned, the weakness of the Safavi state became very marked, and it was overthrown with surprising ease by the Ghalzai Afghans in 1722. Meanwhile, Peter the Great had been formulating his Caspian policy and his more ambitious design to open up an overland trade route to India. His ships roamed the waters of the Caspian, while his officers made charts of that sea and surveyed its shores. 28. Baulked of his hopes of finding a safe route to India via Khiva and Bukhara by the murder of his envoys en route, Peter turned his attention to the western side of the Caspian. When he learnt that the Turks were planning to take advantage of the weakness of Persia to break through to the Caspian, he resolved on immediate invasion. In 1722, using the murder of some Russian traders in Shirvan as a pretext, he descended upon and captured Darband, and in the following year his troops seized Baku and landed in Gilan. When Tahmasp Shah heard of the Russian invasion, he sent an envoy to Peter to negotiate a treaty of alliance. On the 23rd September, 1723, a treaty was signed in6 Moscow whereby Russia, in return for assisting the then fugitive Tahmasp to recover his throne from the Afghans, was to receive Darband and Baku, with their adjoining districts, and the three coastal provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran and Astarabad. 29. The Russian capture of Baku and the subsequent news of the conclusion of this treaty all but caused war to break out between Russia and Turkey, but the good offices of the French Ambassador at Con stantinople brought about the pact between the two countries to which reference has already been made (see para. 5 above). This treaty recognised Russia’s right to all the areas covered by her agreement with Tahmasp. 30. However, Peter’s death in 1725 and the disinclination of his immediate suc cessors to interest themselves in his Caucasian and Persian aims, coupled with the sudden but ephemeral resuscitation of Persia under Nadir Shah, called a tem porary halt to Russian expansion in these parts. 31. After the assassination of Nadir Shah in 1747, Irakli II of Georgia secured the independence of his country for a time, but the threat of Persian invasion in 1783 forced him to place Georgia under Russian protection. In 1795 Agha Muhammad Shah, the first of the Qajar line, succeeded in taking Tiflis, but his troops were soon driven out by the Georgians with Russian aid. The Russians, in a rapid campaign, occupied most of Georgia, northern Azar- baijan and part of Daghistan, but the death of the Empress Catherine and the accession of Paul brought about an abrupt change of policy which resulted in the withdrawal of the Russians to the northern side of the Caucasus range. The Russian withdrawal was, however, merely tempo rary; when another Persian attack on Georgia appeared imminent, the Tsar’s troops again crossed the mountains and soon penetrated as far as Tiflis, which they occupied. On the 20th January, 1801, the whole of Georgia was formally incor porated in the Russian Empire. In the fighting that afterwards ensued. Persia strove to regain what she had lost, but not only did she fail in that object, but she was also unable to stem further Russian advances, except at Erivan. 32. By the treaty of Gulistan, which was signed on 28th October, 1813, Persia ceded to Russia the khanates of Darband, Baku, Qubba, Shirvan, Shekki, Talish, Qarabagh and Ganja, and recognised Russia’s rights in Georgia, Mingrelia, Guriel, Abhazia. Imeritia and Daghistan. The greater part of the frontier between Persia and Russia was formed by the river Aras, but a line was drawn northwards from that river near Ordubad along the crests of the moun tains to the north of Lake Sevan and thence in a generally westerly direction to Arpa-chai river near Gumri (later Alek- sandropol and now Leninakan) so as to leave the khanates of Nakhichevan and Erivan in Persian possession. This fron tier was so ill-defined in the treaty that disputes subsequently broke out and led, in 1824, to another war. Although Persia achieved some successes in the earlier phases of this struggle, she met with defeat in the end. The treaty of Turkmanchai, which was signed on 22nd February, 1828, confirmed all the territorial changes made in Russia’s favour by the treaty of Gulistan, and provided for the cession by Persia of the khanates of Nakhichevan and Erivan, together with Echmiadzin (also known as Vagarshapat), the Metropolitan See of Armenia. Further, a semi-circular area on the right (south) bank of the Aras extending for 3J versts (2-3 miles) on either side of a point immediately opposite the fortress of Abbasandad was ceded to Russia. 33. The frontier laid down by the treaty of Turkmanchai started at Mount Ararat, whence it ran first south-east and then east to the Aras river. The bed of that river served as the frontier until it reached the small semi-circular portion of Russian territory on the right bank (see para. 32 above). After bounding that area on the south, the frontier reverted to the bed of the Aras which it followed up to a point immediately north-east of the small village of Tazakend. At this point the frontier left the Aras and ran south-eastwards for 314 miles across the Mughan steppe to the Bolgar Chai; it followed the bed of the Bolgar Chai upstream to its tributary or continuation, the Adinabazar Chai, and then the right bank of the latter stream as far as its source. Thenceforward, the boundary ran generally in a south-easterly direction along watersheds until it reached the northern source of the Astara river, the bed of which it then followed to its mouth. 34. By the convention of 8th June, 1893, between Russia and Persia, the above- mentioned area south of the Aras opposite Abbasabad was restored to the latter Power (for particulars of this convention see para. 41 below). In all other respects the frontier on the western side of the Caspian Sea remains to-day as it was fixed by the treaty of Turkmanchai.7 (ii) The Russo-Persian Frontier East of the Caspian Sea 35. In former times, before Russia ob tained a footing on the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea, there were no fixed t^ndaries between the great Persian province of Khorasan and the desolate Turkman country to the north. Shah Abbas the Great initiated the practice of settling and maintaining colonies of Kurdish and other warlike tribesmen in the mountainous country in the north of Khorasan in order to keep at bay the pre datory Turkmans. Nadir Shah not only followed this policy actively, but also over ran the whole Turkman country, up to and including Merv Khiva, besides sub duing Bukhara and Samarqand. This extension of Persian authority to the north and north-east was purely ephemeral, and on Nadir's assassination the northern slopes of the mountain fringe formed by the Kopet Dagh, Kuren Dagh, Kuh-i- Hazar Masjid and other ranges to the south-east once again came to constitute the northern limits of Khorasan. 36. Russian interest in the south-east corner of the Caspian and in the regions beyond was first aroused in the time of Peter the Great, but it was not until over a century later that a real attempt was made to establish a foothold in those parts. As Persia was debarred by the treaties of Gulistan and Turkmanchai from main taining warships flying her flag on the Caspian, she was unable to cope with the piratical Turkmans on the south-east coast of that sea. Their raids became so trouble some that in 1834 Persia asked Russia for aid against them. Russia used this request as a pretext for establishing a force on Ashurada Island, which she maintained there for many years, ostensibly for pre venting Turkman raids, despite repeated protests by Persia (it was only in 1921 that Soviet Russia expressly renounced all claim to the island; see para. 42 below). 37. In 1869, wRen Russia seized Qizil- Su (which she renamed Krasnovodsk, the Russian equivalent of the Turki name) and Balkhan Bay, Persia protested, and enquired for what purpose a fort at Kras novodsk was being constructed. She also asked for an assurance that Russia would not interfere with the Yomut Turkmans who inhabited the country round the mouths of the Atrak and Gurgan rivers. Russia, in reply, stated that she recognised Persian authority as far north as the mouth of the Atrak. The Persian Govern ment acquiesced, as they were under the impression that the Russian claim to the territory north of the Atrak applied only to a coastal strip extending inland no more than 30 or 40 miles. 38. Russian expansion eastwards and south-eastwards from Krasnovodsk soon be came very marked. In 1873 Russia took Qizil Arvat and conquered Khiva, and it was not long before she claimed from Persia the northern half of the whole basin of the Atrak. In the meanwhile she had erected a fort at Chikishliar, a place on the Caspian coast 9 miles north-west of the Gulf of Hasan-Quli. In 1880-81 the Russian forces under General Skobelev attacked and completely crushed the Akhal Tekke Turkmans, thus extending Russia’s hold along the northern foothills of the Kopet Dagh and of its extensions south-east ward to Ashkhabad (this name is a Turki corruption of Tshqabad) and beyond. 39. On 21st December, 1881, Russia and Persia concluded a frontier convention at Tehran. This convention defined the frontier from the mouth of the Atrak River (which then flowed into the sea on the southern side of the Gulf of Hasan- Quli) to the small town of Lutfabad, 60 miles east-north-east of Quchan. The Atrak itself served as the boundary as far as Chat, 75 miles east-north-east of the Gulf of Hasan-Quli (as will be seen in paragraph 40 below, the river has since changed its course, and now flows into the Caspian some distance to the north of its former mouth). From Chat the frontier ran first north-east and then east along the ridges of the Songu Dagh and Sagirim for 55 miles; it then swung to the north, crossed the Chandir, a tributary of the Atrak, just to the west of the ruined fort of Yangi-Qaheh, and bore east again until it reached the Kopet Dagh. The boundary then followed the ridges of the Kopet Dagh and other mountains in a predominantly south-easterly direction as far as Lutfabad. This frontier line left the village and district of Firuzeh (which is on the road from Gdk Tepe to Shirvan) in Persia. The convention provided for the demarcation of the frontier as far as Lutfabad. 40. The Russo-Persian delimitation commission began its labours in 1882 and ended its task three years later. It was subsequently discovered that the Persian commissioners had, either through igno rance or bribery, accepted as the extreme western portion of the frontier not the Atrak itself, but an artificial irrigation canal which was several miles to the south of that river. A further complication arose when the Atrak changed its course in its lower reaches, and took a more northerly route to the sea. The Russians•• 8 had a two fold object in seeking to extend their frontier further to the south. In the first place, the irrigable land in the southerly part of the lower Atrak basin was of better quality than the land in the north; secondly, by establishing themselves further to the south, they were able to secure control over practically the whole of the Yamut Turkmans. 41. On 8th June, 1893, Russia and Persia signed another convention at Tehran whereby Persia ceded the village and district of Firuzeh (see para. 39 above) to Russia, and received in return (i) the small area on the right (south) bank of the Aras opposite Abbasabad (see para graph 32 above) and (ii) the village and district of Hisar, which are situated a short distance to the south-east of Lutfabad. This convention defined the frontier south- eastwards from Lutfabad to the Zulfiqar Pass, where the Afghan, Persian and Russian frontiers meet, thus completing the definition of the whole frontier on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea. Provi sion was made in the same convention for the demarcation of the frontier south- eastwards from Lutfabad. 42. There was no further frontier modification by treaty until the Persian and Soviet Governments concluded their treaty of friendship on 26th February, 1921 (this treaty was signed at Tehran only five days after the coup d'etat by Reza Khan and Sayyid Zia ad-Din). By article III of that treaty both Powers— “ . . . . agree to accept and respect the Russo-Persian frontiers as drawn by the Frontier Commission {sic) in 1881. At the same time, in view of the repugnance which the Russian Federal Government feels to enjoying the fruit of the policy of usurpation of the Tsarist Government, it renounces all claim to the Achouradeh (Ashurada) islands and to the other islands on the Astarabad Litoral, and restores to Persia the village of Firouzeh and the adjacent land ceded to Russia in virtue of the convention of 28th May (equivalent to 8th June, new style), 1893. The Persian Government agrees for its part that the Russian Sarakhs or ‘ old ’ Sarakhs and the land adjacent to the Sarakhs River, shall be retained by Russia. “ The two High Contracting Parties shall have equal rights of usage over the Atrak river and the other frontier rivers and waterways. In order finally to solve the question of the waterways and all disputes concerning any territories, a Commission composed of Russian and Persian representatives shall be appointed.” 43. In article XI of the same treaty, it was stated that, as the treaty of Turkmanchai was abrogated,( 3 ) Persia was no longer precluded by article VIII of that treaty from maintaining a fleet( 4 ) on i^e Caspian Sea, and that both Powers should, from the moment of the signature of the present treaty, “enjoy reciprocally the right of navigation on the Caspian Sea under their own flags.” It is noteworthy that, despite this display of magnanimity, the Soviet Government did not hand back, either at that time or subsequently, any of the territories which Russia had acquired from Persia by virtue of the treaties of Gulistan and Turkmanchai (see paras. 32 and 33 above). 44. It is curious that the 1921 treaty limited itself to recognition of the frontier only as laid down by the treaty of 1881; it made no reference whatever to the remain ing portion of the frontier as defined by the convention of the 8th June, 1893. Developments subsequent to the conclusion of the 1921 treaty are, to some extent, wrapped in obscurity. While, on the one hand, the former bed of the lower Atrak seems to have been accepted by the Soviet Union as the extreme western portion of the frontier, such evidence as is available show^s that, at any rate until 1939, the village of Firuzeh was regarded in the U.S.S.R. as being still on the Soviet side of the frontier.( 5 ) Attempts were made by a Perso-Soviet frontier commission in 1922 and subsequent years to delimit the western ( s ) In article I of this treaty the Government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic declared “ the whole body of treaties and conven tions concluded with Persia by the Tsarist Govern ment, which crushed the rights of the Persian people, to be null and void.” ( 4 ) The word fleet is given here, as it is the equivalent of the word ” Plot ” which was used in the original Russian text of the treaty. The Persian Delegate to the League of Nations communicated to that body a French translation of the treaty in which ” Flot ” was erroneously rendered as bateaux (see League of Nations, Treaty Series, Volume IX, page 406). The English version of the treaty in the British State Papers was translated from this French text, and consequently gave vessels as the equivalent of bateaux (see Volume CXIV, page 904^. The matter is rendered perfectly plain by a reference to article VIII of the treaty of Turkmanchai; the first paragraph of that article states that Persian merchant ships were to enjoy the same rights of navigation on the Caspian Sea as Russian merchant ships, while the second paragraph contained the prohibition in regard to the maintenance of Persian warships on that sea. ( 5 ) See the article on Firuzeh in the Bolshaya Sovietskaya Entsiklopedia, 1936. See also sheet. 120 of the Bolshoy Sovictskiy Atlas Mira (1939), which shows Firuzeh as being well within the terri tory of the Turkmenistan SSR.t j 9 portion of the frontier, but, owing to the evasiveness of the Soviet officials, little or nothing could be accomplished. As the lack of a definite frontier line later gave rise to difficulties, it was agreed in March, 1936, that a Perso-Soviet commission s^ald demarcate the boundary as defined by the 1881 treaty (once again, there was no reference to the frontier as defined by the convention of the 8th June, 1893). In July, 1926, it was reported that the Soviet Government were to return to Persia 185 square versts of territory in the neigh bourhood of Pul-i-Khatun (this place is on the left bank of the Hari-Rud river just south of the point where it is joined by the Kashaf-Rud); this land had, it was said,( 6 ) been ceded by Nasir ad-Din Shah to Russia some time in the latter part of the previous century. Since all the land on the west side of the Hari-Rud and Tejend (as the Hari-Rud is known below its junction with the Kashaf-Rud) in this region was already in Persia, the area in question must have been on the east bank of that river to the south of “ old ” Sarakhs. As in the case of Firuzeh, there is no evidence to show that this territory has ever been returned to Persia. There is likewise nothing on record in regard to frontier demarcation since 1926.( 7 ) IV.—Frontier with Afghanistan 45. The Perso-Afghan frontier is 509 miles in length. Although there have in the past been numerous disputes and even wars between Persia and Afghanistan over frontier questions, the whole of the boundary between the two states has been satisfactorily settled in the course of the last 70 years; the task of delimitation was completed only in 1935. 46. The main underlying cause of the frontier disputes between Persia and Afghanistan was, in the earlier days, Persia’s claims to the provinces of Herat and Sistan. On historical grounds she certainly had some justification for her pretensions. ( 6 ) See Meshed despatch No. T/24 dated 20 th May, 1926 (E 4067/100/34). ( 7 ) It 'is known that the local Soviet authorities had for long looked with a jealous eye upon all land that could be irrigated in these regions, together with all sources of water. Sir R. Hodgson, in his despatch No. 229 to the Foreign Office, dated 19th March, 1926 (E2211/100/34), stated that : “ The Russians from time immemorial had not onlv insisted that all the water of the frontier rivers should be devoted to irrigating the cotton fields ot Turkestan, but had gone so far as to compel the Persians inhabiting the frontier regions to root up all their trees so that no part of the water should be absorbed in Persian territory. As a consequence, considerable districts formerly fertile had been reduced to an arid state. I tl Ail f J j4f.£Shah Ismafil, the founder of the Sifivf* dynasty, cojnquered the province of Herat in IfrEQ-r-aad it remained in Persian hands for well over two centuries. In 1716 the Abdali Afghans, who at that time were settled in and around the city of Herat, rebelled and succeeded in throwing off the Persian yoke for some years. Nadir Shah, however, defeated them in 1729 and again in 1732; in the latter year he once again established Persian authority in the pro vince. After Nadir’s assassination in 1747, Ahmad Khan (afterwards Ahmad Shah Durrani), the able Abdali leader, who had been one of Nadir’s proteges, seized Herat and made it part of his newly formed kingdom of Afghanistan. For many years thereafter Persia was too feeble to assert her claims, but she did not give up hope. 48. Path ‘Ali Shah (1797-1834), en couraged by the Russians to seek territorial compensation in the east for what he had had to cede to them in the north-west in 1813 and 1828, twice planned to seize Herat, but on each occasion his project failed to materialise. His anti-British and pro-Russian successor Muhammad Shah (1834—48), who imagined himself to be a reincarnation of the great Nadir, sent an army to take Herat in November 1837, but had to abandon the enterprise after a ten months’ siege, when the British Govern ment, after making strong protests, followed these up with the occupation of Kharak island, in the Persian Gulf. In 1851 Nasir ad-Din Shah (1848-96), after receiving overtures from Sayyid Muham mad Khan, the ruler of Herat, sent a force ostensibly to reduce the Turkmans of the north-east frontier, but actually to occupy Herat. Strong remonstrances by the British Government led to the with drawal of the Persians before they could achieve their object and to the Persian Government giving an undertaking, dated the 25th January, 1853, to abstain from taking possession of the province and from interference in its internal affairs. 49. Notwithstanding this undertaking, the Shah’s forces attacked the city and took it in 1856. This aggressive act brought about the brief Anglo-Persian war of 1857, in the course of which Great Britain again occupied Kharak island and. having landed troops on the mainland, also occupied Bushire and defeated the Persians at Mohammerah. By the treaty of Paris, the Shah agreed to withdraw from Afghan territory, but he nevertheless managed to retain control over Herat through a puppet ruler. This state of affairs was terminated 86-1210 in 1863 when the forceful Dost Muhammad, the founder of the Barakzai dynasty, captured the city a few days before his death. Although Herat was thenceforth mi interruptedly in Afghan possession, the frontier between that province and Khorasan remained unde fined. In consequence, disputes and affrays were numerous, and became so serious that both Persia and Afghanistan asked for British arbitration. The outcome was that, in 1888, Major-General Maclean sur veyed and defined the frontier from the Hashtadan plain, some 60 miles to the west of the city of Herat, to the Zulfiqar pass, where the Afghan Persian and Soviet Persian frontiers meet. Major-General Maclean demarcated this stretch of fron tier, which measures 103 miles, in 1891. 50. Sistan, like Herat, had for long been regarded as part of Persia, since it too had been conquered by Shah IsmaTl. In 1722, when the Ghalzai leader Mahmud over threw the Safavi dynasty by his capture of Isfahan, Malik Mahmud Kayani (or Sistani, as he was sometimes styled), the ruler of Sistan, set himself up as an inde pendent monarch and held sway over the whole of Sistan and part of Khorasan. Nadir Shah defeated Malik Mahmud in 1727 and afterwards put him to death; Sistan was then once more incorporated in Persia. After Nadir’s death, Sistan, like Herat, came under the control of Ahmad Shah, and it remained in Afghan hands for nearly a century. 51. When Afghan authority declined owing to dissensions in the ruling Barakzai clan, Sistan entered upon a troubled period, when rival chiefs strove for mastery over the province. In 1853 Ali Khan Sarandi, who had been for some years ruler of Sistan, declared his allegiance to Persia. His nephew Taj Muhammad overthrew him in 1858, and declared himself independent; however, in 1862, he likewise declared him self a subject of the Shah. Three years later Persia sent an army to occupy the \ 7 province, an act which nearly led to war ' N between her and Afghanistan. Both Powers, however, agreed to accept British mediation, with the result that the Goldsmid Mission, in 187CP72, surveyed the areas under dispute, divided the terri tory between the two countries and defined the frontier between them. By this award, Persia retained the more fertile portion of the province, but had to give up the terri tory which she had occupied on the right bank of the Helmand river. In 1896 a change in the course of that river led to fresh boundary disputes and Great Britain was once more called upon to adjudicate. In consequence, the MacMahon Mission, in 1903-05, defined and demarcated a fresh boundary which both Persia and Afghanistan accepted after some demur. 52. The portion of the frontier thus settled began at the Kuh-i-Malik-i-Siyah whence it ran north-eastwards for 80 m^|^ to the Helmand; it then turned northwards, leaving Zabul (Nasratabad) in Persia, and Chakansur in Afghanistan. Thirty miles north-north-east of Zabul, the frontier swung round almost due west and ran for 66 miles to a point just to the east of the peak known as the Siyah Kuh, making a total of 172 miles. 53. The position then was that, although a strip of 103 miles of frontier in the north and another of 172 in the south had been fixed, a gap of 234 miles between them remained unsettled. In 1930 and onwards a number of disputes and minor clashes occurred over Musa-abad, a hamlet in the Hashtadan district close to the northern end of this stretch of unsettled frontier. Persia and Afghanistan again decided upon arbitration, and this time they invited Turkey to act. The Turkish arbitrator was General Fahrettin (Fakhr ad-Din) Altay. After examining the claims of the contending parties and making a survey of the areas involved, General Fahrettin defined and demarcated the whole of the 234 miles of frontier between the Maclean and MacMahon sections. He completed his task in 1935. By his award, Persia received the hamlet and spring of Musa- abad, while Afghanistan obtained the nearby winter pastures (qishlaq), where certain nomadic Afghan tribes were wont to spend the cold weather. Lake Namak- sar, where the salt deposits are of some value, was bisected by a line running from north to south. Both Persia and Afghani stan accepted the general’s finding, and the demarcation of the entire frontier between the two countries was thus completed. f Y.—Frontier with Baluchistan 54. The frontier between Persian Baluchistan and the British-protected state of Kalat is some 500 miles in length, of which only the portion from the great swamp known as the Hamun-i-Mashkel to a point near Kuhak has been demarcated. 55. Between 1730 and 1738 Nadir Shah conquered and annexed to Persia the terri tories of a number of Baluch chiefs and welded them into a coherent whole under the governorship of Muhabbat Khan Brahoi. In 1739 Nadir added the province of Kacchi to Muhabbat Khan s territory. After Nadir’s assassination in 1747,11 Ahmad Shah obtained control over Baluchistan, dismissed Muhabbat Khan and appointed his younger brother, Nasir Khan, as Governor. 56. Nasir Khan proved a most capable administrator and soon became so strong ^at he rendered no more than nominal allegiance to his suzerain. On Ahmad Shah’s death in 1773, Nasir Khan became independent and ruled Baluchistan until his death in 1795. The country then became a battle-ground for rival chieftains, and remained in a state of chronic disorder for many years. 57. It was not until the beginning of the reign of Nasir ad-Din Shah (1848-96) that Persia sought to recover her former position in Baluchistan. In 1848 the chief of Bampur made an incursion into the pro vince of Kirman. In retaliation, Persian forces invaded Bampur and forced the chief to submit; they thereupon withdrew. In 1849 the chief of Bampur rebelled, and was again subdued by the Persians, who seized and annexed the town of Bampur, a place of some strategic importance. 58. Nasir ad-Din Shah appointed an able man named Ibrahim Khan as Governor of Bam and Bampur. Ibrahim Khan, after firmly establishing Persian authority in the Bampur region, extended it steadily southwards to Geh and south-eastwards to Qasrkand and Sarbaz. As all this terri tory belonged to the British-protected state of Kalat, serious friction developed be tween Great Britain and Persia. When the former Power wished to extend the telegraph line westwards from Gwadar to Jask, the dispute became more acute. In 1870, however, it was agreed to settle the questions at issue by fixing the frontier by means of an Anglo-Persian boundary com mission. In 1871 Sir F. Goldsmid, the British Commissioner, his Persian col league and their respective staffs began their work., Persian obstinacy led to much delay, and it was possible only to define, but not demarcate, the frontier line from Gwatar bay, on the Indian Ocean, as far as Jalq. It proved impossible to reach agreement over the town of Kuhak, on the Mashkel river, so the question of this place was left to be settled later. Immediately after the departure of the British Commis sioner and his staff in 1872, Ibrahim Khan seized Kuhak, together with Isfandak and some other places in the Mashkel valley. In the same year the Persians ousted the Arabs of Muscat from the small port of Chahbar, where they had been established for over three-quarters of a century. 59. Persia’s high-handed action over Kuhak, further encroachments by her in the Mashkel region and serious disputes between Persian tribesmen and the Nushirvanis of Kharan led to renewed friction with Great Britain, and it became evident that a fresh settlement of the frontier question was necessary. In 1895-96 an Anglo-Persian boundary com mission was appointed to define and demar cate the whole of the frontier from the coast to the Kuh-i-Malik-i-Siyah where the frontiers of Persia, Afghanistan and British-protected territory meet. Colonel Sir T. Holdich was the British Commis sioner. As in the case of the previous com mission, tension arose between the British and Persian Commissioners, and it proved impossible to reach agreement on a number of points. Although the whole frontier was defined, demarcation was carried out only from the Mashkel river 6^ miles east by south of Kuhak to the southern edge of the Hamun-i-Mashkel and thence in a west- south-westerly direction for 11 miles to the right bank of the Talab river, a total dis tance of 126| miles. It had been intended to continue the demarcation up to the meet ing point with the Afghan frontier at Kuh- i-Malik-i-Siyah, but the Persian Govern ment failed to send a surveyor to work with the British surveyor, with the result that the boundary was not marked outon the ground, but was merely described( 8 ) and marked on the existing maps; these maps were after wards found to be inaccurate. Some fric tion subsequently occurred between Great Britain and Persia over this undemarcated frontier, particularly in connection with Mirjawa, where the Persian Government erected a customs house in 1902. Great Britain claimed that Mirjawa was on the British side of the line. In an exchange of notes later in 1902, both Powers agreed to appoint a joint commission to complete the demarcation, but, by a further agree ment, dated the 13th May, 1905, Great Britain withdrew her claim to Mirjawa, and both she and Persia agreed to abandon ( 8 ) In the Agreenicnt relating to the demarcation of the boundary between Persian Baluchistan and Kalat, which was signed at Jalq on 24th March, 1896, it was stated that— “ From pillar 11 northwards the Talab river becomes the boundary to its junction with the Mirjawa river. From the point of junction it is carried by a straight line to the nearest point on the watershed of the Mirjawa range, which limits the drainage into the Mirjawa river on the north. Thence it follows the main watershed northwards to the highest point of the Kacha Koh. From the highest point of the Kacha Koh the line is carried straight to the highest point of the Malik Siah Koh.” | The full text of this agreement is given in ! Aitchison’s A Collection of Treaties, Engagements I and Sanads relating to India and neighbouring j\ Countries, Yol. XI, p. 37|, 1 c 2 86-12mmm any further examination of the frontier by a special commission, it being stated that: “ This frontier shall be regarded as definitely settled in accordance with the agreement of 1896, and no further claim shall be made in respect of it.”( 9 ) 60. The present position is that two por tions of the border remain undemarcated; these portions are, first, the stretch from Gwatar bay on the coast to the Mashkel river, and, secondly, the stretch from the south-west of the Hamun-i-Mashkel to the Kuh-i-Malik-i-Siyah. So long as any part of the frontier remains in this unsettled state, not only are tribal quarrels likely to occur, but more serious complications might ensue, if, after the war, attempts are made to obtain oil or other mineral concessions in those regions. YI.—Frontier in the Persian Gulf 61. Although Persia’s claims to sovereignty on the littoral of her side of the Persian Gulf and its approaches have seldom been seriously challenged or over ridden during the last four centuries, the case is very different in regard to certain of the islands in the Gulf, notably the Bahrein group. 62. Portugal was the first European Power to establish a permanent foothold in the Gulf. In 1507 her forces under Albuquerque seized the island of Hormuz, which occupies a strategic posi tion on the northern side of the entrance to the Gulf. Although a mutiny caused the Portuguese to withdraw in the follow ing year, they returned in force in 1515 and forced the Shaikh of Hormuz to become a vassal of Portugal. They likewise established themselves on the adjoining island of Qishm, on the Bahrein islands and, later, on the mainland to the north of Hormuz. 63. Portuguese naval supremacy in the Gulf was soon challenged by the Turks. In 1553 the Portuguese defeated the Turks in a naval battle off Muscat, and in 1559 they drove them out of Bahrein, which they had invaded. 64. The first two Safavi monarchs, Shah Isma'il (1502-24) and Shah Tahmasp I (1524A76), were too much preoccupied with their wars with the Turks to be able seriously to dispute the intrusion of the Portuguese into their southern dominions. However, when Shah Ahbas I (1587-1628) came to the throne, matters began to take a different course. In 1602 the Persians, under the Khan of Shiraz, wrested the Bahrein islands from the Portuguese, and in 1615 they recovered the strip of main land to the north of Hormuz. Seven years ( 9 ) See Aitchison, op. cit., Vol. XI, pp. 381-82. 12 later, a combined English and Persian force drove the Portuguese from their principal stronghold of Hormuz, as well as from Qishm island. Thenceforward the Portuguese made no attempt to secure dominion over any Persian territory. In fact, their power and influence in the G^' were already on the wane, partly because of the growing strength of the English and Dutch East India companies. 65. Early in the XVIIIth century the growing maritime power of the Arabs of Muscat began to make itself felt in the Gulf. By this time Persia, under the effete Shah Sultan Husain, had practically no authority in that area; moreover, she had no navy. The only vessels which she might have been able to use against the Omani Arabs, had she been stronger, were those owned and manned by the Huwala Arabs and others from northern Oman( 10 ) who had settled on her side of the Gulf. These Arabs, however, were virtually, if not entirely, independent; even if the Persians had been in a position to demand their aid, they would, moreover, have been most reluctant to take action against their fellow countrymen from the other side of the Gulf. 66. In 1717 the Imam Sultan ibn Saif II of Muscat seized the islands of Qishm and Larak, and in the following year his forces made a successful descent upon Bahrein. Two years later, the Persians, using ship ping lent by the Portuguese, recovered Bahrein. 67. So seriously did the Persian Govern ment regard the menace of Muscat that they carried on protracted negotiations with the French Government and the representatives in Persia of the French Compagnie des Indes with a view to obtaining French naval aid against the Arabs. They were prepared, in the event of success, to share the booty with the French and to hand Muscat itself over to them; it appears that they were even dis posed for a time to allow the French to establish themselves in Bahrein. They also made similar overtures to the Portuguese (who defeated the Muscat Arabs in a sea fight off Kung in 1719), but French intrigues rendered these negotiations abor tive. 68. However, the proposed Franco- Persian alliance itself came to nothing, because of the Afghan conquest of Persia in 1722. In the state of chaos that ensued in the Gulf the Huwala Arabs of Tahiri C 0 ) These Arabs of northern Oman have often been incorrectly called the Qawasim or Jawasim (in old records the name is distorted to Joasmee); strictly speaking, the term Qawasim should be applied only to the family to which the Shaikh of Sharja belongs.13 {a port on the Persian coast 27 miles north west of Niaband) were able to wrest Bahrein from Persia. In 1736, however, Nadir Shah, who had set himself the tadk of making the waters of the Persian Gulf a Persian preserve, sent an expedition gainst the Huwalas on Bahrein; some of the ships used had been purchased from the English East India Company, while others had been lent by it for the operation. This expedition was completely successful. Nadir followed up this operation with a combined sea and land attack on the Muscat Arabs. In 1737 the Persian forces landed at Khor Fakkan and at Julfar (now known as Ras al-Khaima), ostensibly to assist the Imam to quell a revolt which had broken out amongst his subjects, but in reality to conquer his country. The Persians, after a number of setbacks, took both Muscat and Sohar, but Nadir’s mili tary commitments elsewhere prevented him from sending enough reinforcements for the invaders to be able to retain their hold over the country. Gradually the able Ahmad ibn Sa‘id (who had seized the Imamate) forced the Persians back, and finally drove them out of Oman altogether; the only tangible and lasting result of this expedition was the replacement of the decadent Ya‘riba dynasty by the virile one of the Al-Bu-Sa‘ids. 69. During the period of extreme confu sion that followed the assassination of Nadir Shah in 1747, the Huwala or other Arabs once more secured control over the Bahrein islands, but in 1753 the Shaikh of Bushire re-established Persian authority there. Thirty years later, however, Arabs of the Anaiza tribe, who had been settled on the Arabian coast in the neighbourhood of Koweit since 1716, seized the islands. Except for the years 1801 to 1810, when the islands were held first by the Muscat Arabs and then by the Wahhabis of the Arabian mainland, the A1 Khalifa family of the Anaiza tribe has ever since main tained its hold over Bahrein, despite repeated Persian protests and numerous attempts by Turkey to secure possession. 70. Great Britain’s special connection with Bahrein dates from 1820, when she first entered into treaty relations with the ruling Shaikh. In 1861 Great Britain and Bahrein signed the “ Perpetual Treaty of Peace and Friendship ” whereby Bahrein was recognised as an independent Arab state under the protection of His Majesty’s Government. In her capacity as the protecting Power, Great Britain has consistently rejected all Persian and Turkish claims to sovereignty over the islands, and has sought, but so far without success, to induce the Persian Government to recognise the independence of the Shaikh( u ) (as regards the British rejection and the final lapsing of the Turkish claims to the islands, see para. 76 below). 71. It is to be noted that the discovery of oil and the establishment of an important air station on Bahrein island have increased the commercial and strategic importance of the group; this fact will doubtless be borne in mind by Persia should she, at some future date, again decide to assert her claim either on what she (but no one else) considers to be the merits of the case or as a bargaining factor in some other negotiations. 72. In the second half of the XVIIIth century the Arabs of the Pirate (later called the Trucial) coast of Arabia occupied the islands of Tanb (also called Tunb, Tamb and Tomb), its dependency Nabiyu Tanb, Abu Musa and Sirri; it seems probable that they did so in the very confused period subsequent to the death of Nadir Shah. These Arabs also settled on the Persian littoral, in the same way as the Huwala Arabs had done; it is not recorded when these Arabs actually reached the mainland, but it seems logical to assume that they did so after they or some of their fellows had established themselves on the islands. 73. Much further to the east, Arab infil tration into the mainland occurred in 1792, when Nasir Khan Brahoi, the ruler of Kalat, presented the Imam of Muscat with the small port of Chahbar, in the region which afterwards became known as Persian Makran. Chahbar remained in Arab hands until 1872 (see para. 58 above). 74. At the beginning of the XIXth century the Persian Government leased Bandar Abbas and its dependencies (which included the islands of Qishm and Hormuz) to the Imam of Muscat. The Persian Government expelled the Arabs from these territories in 1856, but granted them a new lease three years later; this lease was terminated in 1868. 75. It was not until 1887 that the Persian Government seriously took up the question of the ownership of the small islands of Tanb, Nabiyu Tanb, Abu Musa ( u ) It is difficult to see on what grounds Persia could successfully maintain any claim to sovereignty or suzerainty over Bahrein. Although the islands formed part of the province of Pars (Pars) in Sasanian times, Persia lost her sovereign rights over them when the Muslim Arabs overthrew the Sasanian monarchy in the Vllth century a.d. It was not until after the break-up of Timur-i-Lang’s heterogeneous empire some seven centuries later that Persia regained any semblance of authority over Bahrein. During the succeeding three and a half centuries, her rule over the islands was not, as has been seen, continuous, and she did not, in fact, exercise anything like effective control for more than 167 years in all.14 and Sirri. In that year they despatched a small force which seized Sirri island; ever since then Sirri has remained in Persian hands. From that time onwards they have repeatedly laid claims to the other islands. Great Britain, while tacitly admitting the Persian claim to Sirri, has always maintained that the Trucial Shaikhs have sovereign rights over the other islands. The Persian contention is that the Arabs of Lingeh had acquired their position on the islands when they were domiciled in Persia and that they were therefore Persian subjects at that time. As stated above, it seems more probable, however, that the Arabs had already acquired their authority on the islands before the time when they or their companions settled on the Persian coast. The view has been put forward that the fact that a section of these Arabs later acquired Persian nationality and held their authority on the Persian coast as chiefs or governors under the Persian crown cannot affect any original rights which the Trucial Arabs on the Arabian coast and those on the Persian littoral may have held in common. The position is complicated by the fact that the Persian Government have refused to recognise the Shaikhs of Trucial Oman as independent rulers. The Persian Government have also refused to recognise the independence of the Shaikh of Koweit; their attitude towards Bahrein has already been de scribed. With the discovery of large oil fields in these countries on the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf, there is always the possibility of international complica tions arising, and it is by no means improbable that the Persian Government will again lay claim to sovereign rights over these Arab countries. 76. In conclusion, some explanation must be given of the special position of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf. As has been seen, the English East India Company established itself in the Gulf early in the XVIIth century, but its interests and activities were purely commercial. It was only towards the end of the XVIIIth century, when the contending Dutch and French interests had been eliminated and ( 12 ) By article XIII of the Anglo-Turkish Conven tion of 29th July, 1918, the Ottoman Government renounced all claim to the Bahrein islands and recognised their independence. Although the out break of war between Great Britain and Turkey prevented the ratification of this Convention, the defeat of Turkey and her resulting withdrawal from the responsibility for policing the Gulf and rendering it safe for trade had devolved upon Great Britain, that her position began to assume a political, as well as a commercial, character. Since that time, besides undertaking the suppression of slavery and the prevention of illicit ai^ traffic in the Gulf, she has been instru mental in quelling the pirates of Ras al- Khaima and other places on the coast of northern Oman and has entered into agree ments with their rulers binding them and their subjects to abstain from piracy. It has already been seen how Great Britain has championed their cause when Persia has attempted to establish her authority over their territories. In regard to Bahrein, besides refuting numerous Persian claims to sovereignty (see paras. 70 and 71 above), Great Britain rejected similar preten sions by Turkey on no less than nineteen occasions between 1839 and 1905.( 12 ) In 1892, on one of the occasions when a Turkish descent upon Bahrein seemed imminent, Great Britain entered into the exclusive series of separate agreements with the rulers of Bahrein and the Trucial Coast whereby the establishment of direct relations between them and any other Power was rendered impossible. 77. Lord Curzon, when Viceroy of India, stated in a despatch in 1899 that the Government of India could not allow “ any European Power, and more especially Russia, to overrun Central and Southern Persia, and so to reach the Gulf or to acquire naval facilities in the latter even without such territorial connections.” In 1903 Lord Lansdowne declared in the House of Lords that the British Govern ment would “ regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.” 78. Although Great Britain has, mainly for strategic reasons, so consistently regarded the Persian Gulf as a British preserve, she has never sought to secure for herself sovereign rights over any portion of Persian territory in that region.( 13 ) the Persian Gulf rendered any subsequent ratifica tion of this Convention superfluous. ( 1S ) No mention has been made here of the former British naval stations at Basidu and Henjam, because there was never any question of Great Britain disputing the sovereign rights of Persia over the areas concerned.
