This he repeated as the situation became more tense; on the second occasion, at an interview punctuated by rifle shois/and* 1 thenar cries of his followers, x aid ay best, without saying it in so many '’ords, to make him see that what he was asking for was moral support. He wanted our help, for the look of the thins, which alone would be enough to turn the day in his favour, and something like this effect he could obtain by other means. 7&gt; me Council on the other hand, fortunately for the Sheikh, made an elementary military mistake. They determined to be quite safe against all comers, and so withdrew their posts, and shut themselves up in the Citadel, they, their police, and the boys of the Y outh League; onus losing control of the town and their mobility; although they were impregnable, as far as the Sheikh was concerned. { / 8 Meanwhile as, about midday, tension grew and the division between the opposing camps became more distinct pY and dangerous, Hbeikh nbduila oalim and some others, encourag ed by me, were busy with an arbitration plan. Envoys from both sides discussed this scheme alternately at the two headquarters, and thus kept negotiation alive. 9 ‘A'i-ien came t&amp;e turning point. It was due to a simple thing - the sale of pitted tomatoes. The Council in their seal for reforms had ten days previously threatened with punishment the semi-nomad gardeners of the uasour - the fortified villages along the Coast, south of Kuwait, should they continue to conceal among their baskets of tomatoes, pitted, unripe or bad ones. The people of therr- - V —ii— (S qasour, whose tomatoea &lt; are a n pitted, were thus bitterly against the Council, and therefore in favour of the Sheikh* They had answered his call to arms - end now arrived by horse, camel, donkey and rattling old cars. A few Bedouins aoproached the Palace about the same time and told of others on their way. The Bedouins in accordance with their customs in war had thrown off their head dresses, and had put on their scarlet, yellow or blue, go±d embroidered surcoats.

The situa tion as you will see was quite serious at one time* and an armed clash was only averted by the efforts of de Gaury and the Arbitration Committee, de Gaury was of course quite right to treat the affair as an internal matter and to side-step the Shaikh’s request for help frcm His Majesty’s Government. The 'pitted tomatoes' incident (paragraph 9 of de Saury*a letter j is excellent. It might well be c oraia era orated by the Ruling family of Kuwait adding to their Coat of Arms* * a S haikh rampant upon a field of pitted tomatoes*. Incidentally* it is interesting to note that Kuwait tomatoes have already acquired a certain reputation. Gallow&amp;y* who has been burying his nose in Arabic literature for the last year or so* points out that a certain vain &amp;1 Haihani who about 15 years ago wrote a book of travel entitled 'Ttoluk al Arab' (TheKinge of the Arabs) gives a vivid description in it of the dire effects of a dish of tomatoes which he had at Kuwait.

C/55 Political \gency, Kuwait, 19th Pehruary, l r 39 My dear Sir Trenchard, Some days ago the Shaikh sent to me privately his draft Constitution for Kuwait, a copy of which I enclose. He asked for my private comments. The only suggestion I made was that he should either cut out the paragraphs stating that Kuwait was an Independent State, or add that Kuwait was under British Protection. He told me later that he had added that Kuwait was under British Protection. I also suggested that the word ,, capa'ble H should he inserted in \rticle 14, with regard to the heir-apparent, a suggestion which he has adopted. 2. More recently he told me that he proposed to put this document before the new Council, whose sittings he has suspended until the matter of the Constitution is settled. He said that he thought the present Council would refuse this reasonable document. If so, he would dissolve the Council and form another by nominating « influential and wise men. 3 . He then went off to narry a new Bedouin wife, and I heard no more until today the 18th, when he told me that he had put the new Constitution before the Council.

As for The Political Agent Card. de Gaury who was absent then, it was said that he went out to the desert for huntin 0 and that he will be bach within, few days time, but when the few days passed, and he did’nt appeared, it was understood that he went to Trans jordan en route Hayil and al Jauf* When he arrived at Al Jauf he chan ;od his car into another one which was waiting for him there sent Cant. Glubb and was taken to Amman. On fl-1-193$ Cart. Gaury arrived at Basrah by air in a snecial plane which have brought him from Amran. At Ba^rah the British Consul arranged a private car for his transport back to Kuwait. It is said tha.t this trim of Capt. de Gaury from Kuwait accrosc the desert to Amman has something to do with a verv important British scheme of opening a servicable track in between Kuwait and the Aqaba across the Saudi Arabian country, but we do not know vet what is the opinion of the King Ibn Sa’ud towards this new colonisation scheme.0^ Kuirmc No IU 3 Dated Original in file No. XTY/l No. P.Z. 214/39 India Office Confidential Whitehall, S.

After examining the subject neither de Gaury nor I see any hope of compromise. Shaikh has decided to dissolve Council and nominate a new one. He has informed me that his position is strong enough to do this and de Gaury agrees. Shaikh is waiting a few days in order to consult notables before taking this step.

A pro-Iraq emissary, one AHMAD bin MUNAIS, a Kuwaiti, long resident in Basra, yesterday gave an address to some members of late Council declaring that the SUBAH were A.o longer rulers of Kuwait and that they should resist them until Iraq army arrived. Thus encouraged there was * an attempt to prevent his arrest by Kuwait police this morning. 2 P In the ensuing scuffle, in #iich first shot fired was against Police, YUSUF MARZOOK (the smuggler) was wounded and one other opponent of police killed, a little later in an attempt to restrain his followers SHAIKH AHMAD was slightly injured. ^ immediate court dealt wi th case of MURAIS, who was condemned as a traitor and publicly shot in main square.

No. C/95 Dated «_, i&amp;L 12th March, 9 V on March 10th saw bloodshed here. I reported in my telegram No. 0/88 of 10th March, 1939, the events on the evening of the 9th and the morning of the 10th, which followed each other quickly, or sometimes were simultaneous, so that even Shaikh Ahmad, when he came to give me the details on the afternoon of the 10th, was not entirely clear about all of them. that 2. ^hat stands out is/traqi propaganda forking on the minds of merchants and town youths of necessarily liioited vision (many of whom have been in increasingly poor circum stances, owing to the Saudi Blockade and the drop in the pearl market) is mainly responsible for what occurred. •' i3 3 . As I reported in my telegram No. C/82 of the 7th March, the Shaikh had dissolved the second Kuwait Council,- which had never functioned as such, on the 7th March. Because the Arabic broadcasts from London had had a good effect, the Shaikh seemed to have chosen his moment well, but the outgoing Council had to hand over to the Shaikh some/2 some papers in their possession and asked for time. These papers, such things as the old Kuwait Constitution, written out hy themselves, and since superseded, hoth in fact and on paper, a contract for removal of gravel, and another for sand, with some others, they evidently set great store 'by, had 'been sent to Basra for safe keeping. 4. The Shaikh told me all about this, and showed me the list of his new Council, a partly elected and partly nominated one, about 3 P.M on the 9th at his country house some railes away from the city, /hile he was doing so, one of his cousins, the black Shaikh, PAHAD bin SALIM AS SUB AFT, a brave and intelligent young man, arrived to report a set back. The State Accountant, a member of the Council, known to his friends as 'the Minister of finance', refused to hand over his account books and was receiving support, and the Council had asked for a few more hours before handing over the papers. None of this seemed very serious so far and while I was there the Shaikh sent back sensible, if, to my mind, slightly confusedly given, orders. 5. Later in the day, however, a certain MORAiLOU) BIN MUNAIS, a Kuwaiti, a small grain merchant living in Iraq., formerly a water carrier here, who arrived on the 7th,and who some people are convinced was on a mission from the Iraq. Government, so authoritatively did he speak, had encouraged young men to distribute leaflets proclaiming the Subah ruling family deposed from power and calling upon the people to resist them. He addressed a gathering of some of the fallen Council in stirring language on the same lines, and they foolishly applauded him anl declared that they would support him; news of which quickly circulated, and caused excitement which lasted until late at night, incidentally being enough to make the new Council hesitate to take office.6 After dark, Colonel Dickson, Chief Local Representative r of the Kuwait Oil Company, and ex: Political Agent, Kuwait, an avowed and staunch opponent of Councils, had an interview ,vith the Shaikh, which in itself gave rise to some further specula tion and rumour. seemed no day for politics, and I was hardly surprised when the negro Shaikh, FAHAD, came to tell me that things now appeared to he going better. The old Council had in the end promised to hand over their precious papers on the evening of the 10th, make no more trouble. The Shaikh, he thought, had now decided not to have an elected Council at all. This last, no doubt, was known to others. with the arrest of MOHOMMAD tin JJUNAIS, which he resisted, being severely cuffed for his trouble. Then, on the way to the prison, this little procession was met by the notorious hot-head and smuggler YUSUF MAH200K, accompanied by MUHAMMAD AL QITAMI, a follower of the former Council. There was an altercation. MUHAMMAD shot at and missed the Police. YUSUF put his hand to his revolver and the police fired, mortally wounding al i^ITAMI, hitting Yusuf in the foot, and a nearby shopkeeper in the posterior. 9. There was of course once more confusion all over the town. The Bedouins rushed to arms shouting 'To the Sub ah', 'They are attacking the Subhh', and Shaikh Ahmad arrived only just in time to prevent an outbreak of firing and the murder of Mohommad al Munais. (In doing so he was hit on the back of the head by a rifle butt). Promise of an immediate trial of Munais staved off the fury of the tribal followers for the moment, but it is hardly surprising that the Subah judges, maddened by weeks of Iraq.! propaganda against them, with the screams of the tribes- 7.

Meanwhile the Director of Security had rightly proceededi -4- men in their ears, and the general situation as dangerous as it was, shortly announced him a convicted traitor and the sentence as death. The man was publicly shot, and subsequent! hung until evening, in the main square. The effect of the execution was to send most people to ground immediately. As the gates were held no one could get away from Kuwait, and after some rather protracted hide aryl seek, all the 'wanted'* members of the late Council, five in number were found and placed under arrest. 11. The day ended with Shaikh Ahmad leading a «ar dance in the main square and with any hope of an elected council peacefully aiding him in the administration, gone for a long time, if not for good. 12. Kis Highness spoke to me on the morning or trie litn of his intention to form an advisory council from his family am the notables.

In particular there was an article about Kuwait in the last number, of which I enclose a copy herewith. 2. It is not a particularly bad article of course, but the alleged facts seem to be a little exaggerated, in com parison with other news that I have heard, and some of the comments are to my mind improper. 3. When I get the real facts from you I shall be in a better position to take the matter up seriously with the Bahrain Government and with the editor, and to ensure that unfair comment about Kuwait is excluded. I expect the facts will all be in your diary, but it takes such a long time to get here, and that was why I asked for an air mail letter. I apologise once more for worrying you when you must be tre mendously busy. G.S.H. de Gaury, M.C., Political Agent, L Kuwait Yours sincerely,No. 2. Bahrain, 16th March 1939 V/HAT IS HAPPENING IN KUWAIT ? We promised our Headers in the last number that we would acquaint them with the latest developments. 7/ould that nothing had happened l We, who are co-related to the people of Kuwait not only in language, religion and intimate neighbourhood but also in blood, were much grieved at the course of events there. Letters by post confirmed lately by Radio have brought home to us the news of the recent agitations in which three lives were lost, not to mention the wounded. The Amir himself was attacked with a volley of shots, but it is affirmed that his wounds are slight. Although we are not in possession of details which may be relied upon, we shallt ry to explain as clearly as possible the fragmentary news that has reached our ears. The Sheikh it seems came lately to know that a person named Mohamed el Munais, who regularly moves febout between Kuwait and Basra, was endeavouring to put an end to the rule of A1 Sabah in Kuwait, making Kuwait a part of Iraq. This man may have signed some of the telegrams pro claimed from '^asr er Zuhur' Broadcasting Station. The Amir accordingly charged him with high treason for carrying on such intrigues, and, prosecuting him in a special court held for the purpose, condemned him to death on the gallows. The members of the Majlis thought this too much, and approached one of the favourites of the Amir in the hope that he might be able to persuade the Shaikh to alleviate the sentence.They accompanied the mediator to the them in a state of extreme rage and treated favourably. It is said that he ordered the strike them or fire at them. Later, whilst the man was being executed, a clash occurred. Some of the supporters of the Majlis fired a few rounds and the soldiers of the Amir did the like. It is said that one person was killed (in the con flict) - some say, two. But many were undoubtedly wounded. At this stage the Amir received the casual wounds mentioned above. On Monday evening it was broadcast from London that members of the Majlis proclaimed the end of the reign of the House of A1 Sabah in Kuwait and were all arrested and put in custody. In spite of the gravity of the situation which might invoke the clement to lose patience ve hope the Amir will try to put aside the sentence of death from the list of punishments for those who disregard his authority. In hoping this, we are expressing the opinion of Bahrainis in general who are all excited and troubled at the recent news. x Amir who met them most un soldiers toCONFID ENTIAL GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. .. . 1 So 33 1 - DcueJ conf ld«nt laX .

Yhen the other members of the Hu ling Yamily came to know of this, they got annoyed at this attempt and decided to oppose it. Shaikh Subah an Nasir as Subah, who is in charge of the said prisoners, became furious and started abusing Shaikh Yusuf publicly and in an insulting way. Shaikh Yusuf, on hearing this, approached H.H? and complaj^d against Subah. TT .H. was rather apologetic. As regards the prisoners, it is said that H.H. alluded that the Yamily members were opposed to this request and that he was averse in going against their wish. This incident caused a little ill-feeling amongst certain local people, especially VAl J’ina’at’, followers of Siiaikh Yusuf bin ’Isa. 2. It is said that H.H. the Shaikh consulted Shaikh Yusuf bin ’Isa, Inspector of Educational about the invitation of Mr. Vallance to Kuwait and the appointment of an English Schoolmaster for the School and that Shaikh Yusuf said he saw no objection to inviting an Inspector but that it was quite undesirable to have an English schoolmaster here.

YUSUF MAEZ00K, who has teen confined to bed since he received a wound in his foot and who was due for release from the Mission Hospital, was marched off to prison yesterday. He is now confined in the same ■-h building as his fellow conspirators. 3. It appears that the Shaikh consulted the Subah family as to whether Maruook should be imprisoned or not, and that the general, concensus of opinion was tnat he should be. Ali al Xhalifah, I believe, demurred on the grounds of old friendsnip, but any dissention was soon put down by the Shaikh’s son Abdulla bin Ahmad who said that if Marzook were released he would kill him wherever he might be found. 4. I think the Shaikh’s action is laudable, for it shows that he is firm in his determination to deal out retribution, and to do what ha can to keep order in the country. There is no possible room for doubt that Marzook deserves to be imprisoned, for he is, in the words of Doughty ,*a desperate cutter of the town*. 5.

The P.W.D. is / also making a good effort in completing the building of the modern pier near the Customs, besides that, there are is a Directorate for Public Security and a Police Station. The Municipality has decided to open a new road connecting the general square to the sea-shore, the length of which will be about 800 metres and the width 40 feet. Owners of houses which will be demolished on account of the opening of this road will be compensated. This is as far as the architectural improvement is concerned. As regards the sanitation, the Government have decided to build a large hospital, and when this has been completed the government will build two dispensaries for treating the sick and poor people free. Here are two geologists who are still exploring for drinkable water, its regards education, the Directorate of Education have considered the question of bringing some teachers in aaaition to the present Palestinian teachers and have also decided to send a group of students to join the Egyptian schools. This will be the second batch as the first one has air eddy been sent to AL AEHAR AH SHaRIE for studying religious lessons. This is really a blessed step towards advancement that which i s in existence in Kuwait, the Arabian Emirate - which pleases every .Arab who wishes this happy Emirate to continue in prosperity under her Ruler, Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Subah.News cair^ frora Kuwait that during the last few days a number of official and traditional ceremonies took place; the first one being the inaugural ceremfiny of the new Advisory Council and Law Courts building. In the morning of Saturday last H.H.Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Subah, ^mir of Kuwait, inaugurated the Advisory Council building amidst amidst signs of great joy. He was welcomed by all members of the Council and a large number of notables and distinguished people were also invited. H.H. read a brief speech in which lie made a mention of the valuable efforts made by the members of the Advisory Council for the good of their country and the comfort ana progress of the people in every aspect. On another occasion we will talk to you about the administrative projects carried out by the members of the new Council during this short period, i.e. , since the formation of the council until now. H.H. concluded his speech by praying God to lead the sincere people of this Smirate to what is advantageous to their country and nation. Thesd words were receivea by warm acclamation. Later H.H. moved to the Court House where he inspected the rooms one by one and greatly admired the splendour of the modern building which was nicely arranged. The second ceremony is indeed one of the most cheerful ceremonies ever held as this is the first time in the history of Kuwait that a historic drama is played by the Mubarakiyah School, as daamas are almost f©bidden here. The presence of H.H. the Ruler added to the gaity and grandeur of this historic drama the subject of which was the Caliph Omar al Faruq ibn-al-Khattab, whose regime was noted for descipline, justice and security. When the Amir arrived at the School the soldiers who were standing in order on both sides of the road saluted him and cheers went high for H.H f s long life. The British Political Agent was amongst those who attended the ceremony. n!The last ceremony was the great war dance held at the large twon square, in which the desert forces, the bodyguard and the police took part. It is worthy to mention that it was originally intended to hold this review on the day of the inauguration ox the Council building bmt it was postponed to this day which coincided with the birthday of His Majesty the King, which was one of the best opportunities. The Kuwait state departments participated in celebrating H.M*s birthday, flew flags and stopped their work. Last week was indeed a week of merriment in Kuwait as the Kuwaiti nation got an opportunity to reveal the love and loyalty v/hich they entertain for H.H. the Ruler who has always been w orking for their prosperity./ t r ^ C ' 0 \ ' lit Any further communication on this subject should be addressed to The Resident Adviser, Mukalla via ADEN and the following No. / quoted No»181/39/ 0.

My dear Colonel, Now that liamadhan is over, it seems an appropriate time to send you a brief resume of the political situation from the date of my taking over till ’Id. 2. As you are already aware the political situation in Kuwait has been in a dangerous state of unrest due to both internal and external influences for some time. Six months have passed since the conflagration of this spring and it is fair to say that the situation need not give cause for anxiety, though it should not be thought that all is well, for it is not. 3. The reasons for this improvement are not difficult to find and are due more, I regret to say, to the disappea rance of external causes than to any improvement in the internal administration. Against this removal of the old disturbing external influences, however, must be added the outbreak of war which was received here with calm, and although public opinion was not completely in favour of the Shaikh siding openly with the Allies, yet events at the time showed that he had by then recovered his position sufficiently to control prices and exports, and to impose his authority on the merchants who only a few months pre viously had been in power. The fact that the 'Alan' was exhibited stating that Great Britain was fighting “aggression*/ The Hon’ble Lieut-Ool. C.G. Prior, CIS., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Kuwait.6./ 2 - rt aggression”, that no mention was made of Germany, and that the alteration in the agreed form was made hy the Shaikh^ advisers unknown to him, is an example of the indefinite attitude existing at that time. The Shaikh immediately put the matter right on my bringing it to his notice. 4. The external influences mentioned above can be summed up very briefly as they are outside my sphere: (1) The death of Iting Ghazi of Iraq., (2) The Prime ’Tinister of Iraq's suppression of anti-Kuwait propaganda. (3) The improvement in the situation in Palestine. (4) The improvement in Saudi-Kuwait relations. 5. With regard to the internal side, an influential Arab trader told me this spring that life would be far simpler for Kuwaitis if they had fewer masters, and it was obvious that a state of uncertainty then existed. I, therefore, devoted such influence as I possessed to res toring the authority of the Shaikh, and to enabling him to regain the confidence of the people without alienating him from his Council though to some extent this involved cold- shouldering the influential men of the anti-Shaikh party. There is little doubt that the Political Agent has great influence in the Town, and this influence is unwittingly enhanced by the State authorities who frequently use the^ Political Agent as a stalking-horse when they are forced to take unpopular measures, and although by this means the Political Agent may acquire something of the reputation of an ogre, yet he also gains in influence. The Political Agent, therefore, inevitably has a decisive effect upon public opinion, and it only remains for him to exert it in the right direction.3 /-v ✓ \ HTT/ 6, After six montJis the Shaikh’s star is definitely in the asoendant. I cannot say what effect any action of mine may have had, hut there have heen other causes at work which I will mention briefly. The first is the belief of most Kuwaitis that the Shaikh is right in his pro-British attitude, in as much as they think that Britain is certain to win the war. Another reason is that while Iraq, is friendly to Britain agitation through that country will achieve nothing. A third is that the people now seem to believe that Britain is genuinely desirous of helping the Arabs in Palestine. This reacts on Kuwait since the anti- Shaikh party can no longer blame the Buler for supporting the Power which they believed was oppressing their co-reli gionists in Palestine. Another reason is a somewhat improved attitude on the part of the Shaikh towards his people combined with the firm support he has received from his cousin Ali al Khalifah. Then again the leaders of the old opposition party are now pre-occupied with certain business intrigues which are irrelevant here. Other influences which may be mentioned are the control of the importation of news papers, and the ban on the Berlin radio-station. 7. I said above that all is not yet well, and this needs some explanation. The greater proportion of the merchants of Kuwait are q.uiet every-day persons, primarily interested in acquiring wealth, and do not concern themselves with politics except as it helps or hinders their money making. But certain things disturb them. One was the old- fashioned prison arrangements which are now being improved, and another is the unsatisfactory standard of schooling avail* able in Kuwait. This forces the better class of parent to send their children to Iraq., and it is the unemployed younger sons//~N sons who have returned from this pernicious atmosphere who form an undercurrent of unrest. They are now, however, without influence, and no serious agitation can come from them while their fathers are busily engaged in watching the difficult markets of today. Finally, the lack of any State medical institution gives the people just grounds for complaint though this is slowly being remedied. 8. On the whole, my opinion is that the political situation is now quieter than it has been for some years, and in support of this view it may be mentioned that the leader of the •'Opposition' left Kuwait for the ’Id. This position may be expected to continue so long as fortune favours the Allies, and our trade is not unduly affected, but we can expect little support from Kuwait if the tide should turn against us. For myself, in the future, I propose to mix more freely with the leading men of the Town, and see that the Shaikh does not lapse into his former atti tude of indifference to public opinion to which, I am convinced, most of his troubles are due.

No. C/530, dated the 8th December, 1940? 2 1/hen I was in Basra last week-end Lloyd (until recently the Basra Judge, and now President of the Bate Board) came to see me to ask if I had any objection to his writing to the Shaikh with a view to securing the release of Yusuf al Marzook from prison. He explained that the continuance of Marzook and his associates in prison was being laid at our door, and that the Shaikh gave out that he was willing to release the men but that we would not let him. There was nothing new in that to me. Lloyd went on to say that he was actively engaged in propaganda work in Basra, and that our keeping the revolutionaries in jail was having a bad effect. Lloyd attempted to justify his approach to me and his desired approach to the Shaikh on the grounds that he had done a lot for the latter in the past in connection with the Bate Gardens • 3. I told Lloyd that it seemed to me that he was being got at by the anti British-Subah party in Basra, that I did not believe that the people of Basra as a whole v/ere in the least interested in Kuwaiti prisoners, and that I thought it most undesirable for him to take any action in the matter. 4. Weld-Borester also approached me twice on the same subject/ The Hon f ble Lieut-Colonel C.G. 'rior, CIE., Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, at Bahrain.subject, though from a slightly different angle, and he received much the same sort of replies as Lloyd, 5. On my return to Kuwait I mentioned the matter to the Shaikh who stated that the prisoners were comfor- tahly accommodated and that their families had access to them. The men have done about two years in prison now, and I see no reason why we should speak to the Shaikh on their behalf. Were we to do so, I do not believe that we should get any thanks, rather we should incur the odium of the Shaikh and the Subah family, and give the agitators a free hand in preparing their revenge. Yours sincerely,No. Sff Pile. 5/7/2 BRITISH CONSULATE. BASRA 26th February, 1941 confidential Reference our telephone conversation to-day, the man in question is Yusuf el Marzook. As you know old Mandil Pasha who was a relation, died about 2 months ago. He apparently held Marzook had only got his deserts for being a fool and creating trouble and refused to intervene in any way on his behalf. Now he is dead the entire family have persuaded the school boy son of Mandil Pasha and the latter’s agent who is the son’s guardian to approach me for support to get Marzook, who has according to them done 2 years in prison, out as they say 2 years should be ehough punishment I told Mana’ the agent, who cSme to me, that in my opinion the best way would be to get a^ petition presented direct to the Shaikh, and I said I would mention the matter to you.

Mote on Moha mmad Bln Barak . 1. Mohammad Bin Barak came to India in February 1941 stating that he was a patty dealer in piecegoods from Kuwait and had come to Bombay in connection with his business. In his younger days, it is reported that he was fond of reading revolutionary literature and was well up in books on Nazism and Bolshevism. He has indulged in revolu tionary activities in Kuwait, Iraq and Syria and is by nature restless and against any form of authority. After being ordered to leave Kuwait he went to Iraq where, at Basra and Baghdad, he attended meetings organised by pro-Nazi revolu tionaries whose willing tool he became and with whom he maintained close relations before leaving for India. In Basra he took an active part in the conspiracy to overthrow the Ruler of Kuwait and was also deported by the French Authorities from Syria which place he visited three times during 1938 and 1940. There is no doubt that he has indluged in anti-British and pro-Nazi activities . While in Kuwait, assisted by money received (it is now reasonably certain' through the German Embassy in Iraq, he organised a small X library-cum-club and began to ±xk£w twA inculcate both Nazi and Communistic ideas among youths of the country. In Iraq he is known to have maintained close relations with and worked for Iraqi Nazis and other known anti-British agitators working through the Muthanna Club in BrngakwA Baghdad (a pro-Nazi political organisation with branches all over Ira^)* It is even suspected that Mohammad Bin Barak was sent to India by the Muthanna Club in order to carry on subversive activities here. It is believed that in October 1940, he was connected with espionage on behalf of the Italians and was in touch with similar suspects engaged in the Dhow traffic between Iraq, Iran and India. In 1940, he was deported from Syria by the French authorities and while in Iraq he maintained close relations with j^pro-Nazi Iraqis like Abdul Qadir Essa Yab, Basra Editor of the An Nas News and also with Abdulla al Saqar, who, at the time of the Iraq rebellion under Rashid All al Gailani, fled to Baghdad and joined Rashid All. 2 . *or the above reasons it was decided that h* should not be allowed during the War to remain at liberty in Bombay and orders for his detention were passed. He was arrested on the 17th September 1941 and was returned to Kuwait in October 1946.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000c9_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/206</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000c9</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/206</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 4/20 II Kuwait Situation: Constitution and Council'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1938/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-02T22:24:52</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (198 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 200; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
