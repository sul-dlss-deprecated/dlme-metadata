The request for Sultan in your signal C/222 seems equivalent to asking him to consent to making advances of un specified amounts in Dhofar against payments in Muscat the trans port of which to Dhofar we cannot even predict at present. I think the best course would be for you with Jackson to explain your difficulty to Sultan and to ask him, when you visit Dhofar, the limit in dollars to which he can made payments on your behalf without a further remittance and then to try to make some arrange ment feasible for yourself and Sultan.

Present :- 1# Air Commodore A.Claud Wright, Deputy Directca: of Civil Aviation in India. 2. Mr* J.H.Carapbell, Executive Engineer, Civil Aviation Directorate, India. 3. Col. Chevis, Works Representative from IRAQ and representing ADOS. 4. SQ.I/ir. Haile, Representative from Air H.Q. INDIA. OBJECT: . . • . 1. In their aigoal X956, dated 8.11.41, paragraph 2, the Air Ministry wishes that responsibility for the development of facili ties should rest with the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief MIDDLE EAST, but that Indian resources should be used as far as possible in developing route facilities. 2. Air H.Q.MIDDLE EAST in their signal A277, dated 23.12.41, stated their requirements as a result of which the work to be undertaken by D.C.A.*s Department. IUDIA, was reported to the Air Ministry in letter Ho'.W99-5, dated the 5th March, copies of which were forwarded by Air H.Q. INDIA to Air H.Q.MIDDLE EAST. IRAQ and ADEN. Subsequent to this, various enquiries were made by Air H.Q. INDIA as to any further accommodation required for Care and Maintenance Parties eiA On 28.4.42 Air H.Q. MIDDLE EAST issued their Administrative Order No.271 and on 6.5.42 issued their signal No.0.148. In these communications the responsibility for staging posts and future works services was allocated to Air H.Q. ADEN and IRAQ. 3. Further requirementsregarding staging posts etc. involve considerable increases in tne building orogramme referred to in D.C.A.’s Report to the A ir Ministry v799-5,dated the 5th March. 4. It therefore became apparent that dates and methods of handing over responsibility to Air H.Q.MIDDLE EAST should be arranged, for which purpose this meeting is arranged. To this end, Mr. Campbell, the Executive Engineer in charge of the route, and Col. Chevis, Works Representative from Air H.^. IRAQ, visited SALALAH. MA3IRA and RAS-Al-KADD, meeting the 3.A.3.0. Air H.Q. ADEN at SALALAH. The Political Agent was met at I^JSCAT and the Assistant Political Agent at MA3IRA and SALALAH. 5. As a result of this visit, the following recommendations for handing over the route to Air H.Q. IRAQ and Air H.Q. ADEN were discussed in Delhi a A LjLkiJi. 6. Referring to D.C.A. f s Report to the Air Ministry //99-5, dated 5th Marcn, the present position at SALALAH is that - (a) The aerodrome is completed including the extensions (b) The whole of the divil accommodation is completed with the eiception of two Indian staff quarters and two extra petrol stores under construction, providing storage for a total of 75,000 gallons. (o)/‘iJS (o) B.A&gt;F. requiremerToa . (i) Explosive stares are completed. (ii) The work on petrol stores was stopped in accordance with lying Commander Keene’s suggestion. The S.A.S*0.. Air H.Q., ADEN, suggested that the petrol stores are not requirea but that dumps should be dispersed outside the periphery of the landing ground. These have oeen sited. (iii) The M.T. garages have not been started. (iv) The accommodation for the Care and Maintenance Parties has not been started, but the present staging party has been provided with tents_by Air H.J.ADEN and certain aeroplane cases a^re being used as ?/T and office accommodation. 7* It is recpmmended that Air H.Q. ADEN takes over full responsi bility rorTheiurtner development of 3ALALAE at once, it is underst od that the S*A.S.0. t Air H.Q. ADEN, agrees with this. As Mr. Eaton, the Asstt. Executive Engineer employed by D.8.A. INDIA, is willing to extend his service until August under the jurisdiction of Air H.Q.AD3F, the only condition in handing over uALALAH is that kha he may be permitted to complete the two staff quarters and two pertrol stores for B.O.A.C. wfcdoh are the last remaining part of the civil accommodation required to be built. 8. As Mr. Eaton lias indicated verbally that he is willing to continue at SALAIAH until Air H.Q.ADEN’s requirements are completed, MXfiilJ^KXBmaftjuitf&amp;x&amp;iJ^SsAxbaxgaRix&amp;xsdxsxdjfxrxhixxfixi&amp;KiisBxjEa it only remains for this to be confirmed and for his extension to be taken up by D.C.A. INDIA with the PUNJAB GK)7ERNM&amp;NT. The question of the retention of the Director General of Observatories, i INDIAN meteorological Staff at Salalah will be taken up separately when the policy regarding the provision of meteorological services by tlie R.A.F. has been caltified. This will be taken up by Air H.Q. INDIA. 9. It is presumed that B.O.A.C. INDIA will nave no objection to this Station coming withing the ADEN zone of operations in a similar way as the B-O.A.O. PERSIAN GULF Stations come within the Air H.Q. IRAQ'S sphere of operations. 10* Recornmended Ahat the goared provided by the Sultan of MUSCAT shouJd continue to be employed. M A s I R A. 11. The present position is that - (a) The landing ground at RAS HILF as described in D.C.A.'s No.W99-5, dated 5th Eferch, is completed. (b) At RAS HILF - (i) The civil accommodation for 20 passengers is in course of erection together with staff quarters for two Europeans and six Indians and /i//T Station which have been completed. All civil petrol stores are compitod. (ii) The R.A.F. petrol and explosive stores are completed. Three pairs of aircraft pacKing cases have been erected which are sufficient to accoommodate the 6 officers and 60 airmen comprising the aerodrome maintenance party and the W/T party. These numbers were given by Col. Chevis. Further, a stone barrack block for 18 airmen is in course of consturction. (c)/-13 /—————— • 3 - ^P\ (c) At UL' VJ&amp;kZ the fIvins boat alighting area haa been defined by Marker Buoya. The mooring buoys and gear are in atore at the moment and have not been issued* In addition there £ is one R.A.F. tender and power dinghy. Of the original 10 petrol stores to be erected alongside the alighting area, 4 are completed 4 are having roofs put on and the original B.O.A.C. dormitory located at UM RASaS ia being converted into a petrol store equivalent to 5 standard stores. The total number of standard petrol stores haa therefore been increased to 13. (d) The distillati n plant haa been erected at TJM RASAS. This has not yet been tested owing to the failure of the main sea-line motor. Arrangements have been made by Mr. Campbell to replace the motor as early as possible; otherwise, the plant is c omplete. (o) Guards . The 10 Army, IRAQ, has arranged for one Platoon of approximately 2 officers and 44 men to proceed to MA3 T RA and '' y will occupy the tents The orders for the O.C.state and M.T. left behiild by No.5 Artizan Company. This guard will be located at HAS HILF. (f) Second Lieut* Boyd and some 50 Skilled men plus followers of No.5 Artizan Company have been left at MA3IRA to complete the present revised works programme. 12. It is estimated that the present works programne as indiaated in D.C.A.'s Report, to the Air Ministry plus temporary accommoda tion for the increased Care and Maintenance party will be completed by the middle of July. 13. I&amp;iii_therof p re recommended that MASTRA should be completely handed over to Air H/Q. IRAQ on the completion of the work as stated in paragraph 11 above. The remainder of No.5 Artizan Company my then be withdrawn, after which Air H.Q.IRAQ will make their own arrangements for the execution of any further works. The most convenient method of evacuating the rear party of No«5 Artizan Company would be by ship, preferably S.S# ^ANIRA. It is understood that the Captain of this vessel is willing to load and oi'f-load with ship’s boats in the BAN DBA BAY throughout the monson. 14. It is most important the the completion of the present works programme should be uninterrupted and to this end the control of available transport should be left in the hands of the O.C. Rear Party of No.5 Artizan Company and orders should be issued to the Platoon Commander to this effect. 15. It is realised that as the main camp has now been moved from UMRA3AS to RA3 HILF, it is necessary to re-locate the distilla tion plant at RAS HILF. The equipment is very heavy and cannot be mo ed over the present road nor by dhows as they are not available during the monsoon season/ The transfer of the disti llation plant cannot therefore take place until after the monsoon. 16. It is recommended that the employment of 300 MUSCAT coolies at presert at MAS IRA should be taken over and administered by the vn&gt;rks .services, Air H.C. IRAQ when the remainder of the works is handed over on the 15th July. Their subsequent employment and feeding aili tnen be the raanonsibili+.y of the tforks Services, Air H. '.IRAQ. (See paragraph* 45), 17. The Questions of the release of the 80-ton water barge to quartermaster General, INDIA, destined for BASRA was discussed and in view of the urgent neceasit no fresh water is indige— the 80-ton barge remains Quartermaster General, INDIA, destined for BASRA was discussed a m view of the urgent necessity to provide water at MA3IRA where arrangements, However, must be vade f^r its safe mooring. „ that18# The future use of the NGORAN I is discussed under para.37. It is recommended that it will be retained indefinitely at MSIRA. 19. It ia desired to record that the bearings of the longer runway depend primarily upon the apece available and the Tie of the land. 20. The present position is - (a) The 1650-yard runway, i.e. East-Test, is now completed up to 800 yds. and 1300 yds. snou.d be com deted by the end of June or first wee* of July, which 7/ill then cake RAA-AL-RADD available for restricted air operation. The remainder 350 yds. of the longer runway should be left undtil ,he second runway is complied. It is eati.mated that both runways should under favourable conditions be completed by the end of August or in any case by the end of the monso&amp;n. (b) There aro no Civil Aviation buildings required, except one store of 5000 gallons, as RAS-AL-HADD ia an emergency stop only. Certain civil buildings e.g. W/T buildings, stores, were originally put in hand in the shape of prefabricated buildings at Karaohii but thes-3 can be used for R.A.F. purposes as they are of standard design. (c) The explosive and petrol storos referred to in D.C.A.’s Report have buen,shipped to RAS-AL-HADD. The remaining ^ prefabricated buildings for H.A.r. purposes referred to in this report aro in course of consgtruction at Karachi. Prsfabrication ^ h r js not so far been started for the 6 officers and 66 staging cum v.'/i party reQuired by the R.A.F. There are at Karachi approximately 18 to 20 R.A.F. cases of the original 30 allotted by Air H.Q* IFDIAi wnich could be used as temporary accommodation. (d) There a-re at present two distillation units which are in course of erection at RkS^AL-E^DD, the second one being a reserve lor replacement either at RAS-AL-HADD or MASIRA in emergency only. . . (?) In spite of urgent representations to Air H.O.. IRAQ, to install an R.A.F. pack set at RAS-AL-HADD with hich there are no communications except by cUiow to Muscat (some 106 miles), no R.A.F* pacK set has been located at RA3- AL-HADD. This provision has apparently been delayed on account of onsuring that adeQuate accommodation ia available for it. (See paragraph 24). (f) barker buoys, mooring buoys, petrol and explosive stores are available for installation at KHOR JARIMA but have not been installed because of difficulties of road communications and because of the adverse report upon the suitability of the alighting area at KEOR JARAMA for flying boats included in llr.

Dear Sir, We regret to inform you that a sum of Rs. / # 0 fto 5 -j is outstanding against the Royal Air Force up to date and that this sum is due for a very long time. The RAF material was unloaded from steamers under instructions from your good self. We shall be highly obliged if this bill is paid as early as possible as we are urgently in need of money. For future we request that if any more shi^ s are to be unloaded arrangements may kindly be made to pay us cash as soon as we present our bills to you. Our charges in future will be as at present but if we are called upon by the boatmen and labour to pay them more, our charges and commission as we charge now i.e. fe 2 /- a ton will change accordingly. We suggest that two lighter* for unloading RAF material at Masira may be enggged by us as has been done at Ras al Hadd. This can be arranged at the same rate as that of the Ras al Hadd lighters i.e. # 25/- a day each. When RAF work is over the charges for taking them to Masirah and bringing them back here will be chargeable from RAF. We shall also charge for cleaning and caulking them. If any of these lighters is destroyed by fire, sotrm or otherwise the RAF will have to pay their cost. Yours faithfully,Sir, We beg to inform you as underi- 1 . Iwe have kept from 15th June 1^42 two lighters for unloading RAF material from ships on RAF account and risk at £ 25// a day each.

August 5th, 1942 I enclose copies (with their enclosures) of Jackson's demi-official letters No. J both dated the 19th June 1942. I endorse Jackson's opinion generally on the questions he has dealt with and wish to add my own comments. 2 Unloading at Masirah . I gather from the copy of Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf's signal herewith (No. 0724 dated the 30th June, 1942) that more ships may be expected for unloading at Masirah after the monsoon. This being so, it is essential that unloading facilities other than the local boatmen be provided if we are not again to have a repetition of the delays of ships, damage to cargoes (due to careless handling by the boatmen) and the disorganisation which followed on the breakdown of unloading arrangements in May and June last. The local boat men are, in ray opinion, Bedouinof the worst type whose promises are not to be trusted for an instant, imperious to any consideration other than immediate gain and it will be a delusion to expect any co-operation unless we have the whip hand of them. Thanks to their work, the damage to petrol cases landed at Masirah must be far greater than the 25% damage which is reliably estimated at Ras-al Hadd where conditions are as satisfactory as possible with the local means. As for help from here the only thing I can suggest is that Gokaldas 3 offered them for obvious reasons, be asked to send two barges to Masirah when they are needed, but power towage for them or for any other barges sent would have to be supplied. There is none to be got here. To be independent of the boatmen, barges other than Gokaldas 1 would also probably be / needed Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel W.R. Hay, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.2 needed. 3. Unloading at Salalah . As you will observe from Jackson’s letter the problem there is not nearly as acute but the provision of a barge or barges is also for consideration. 4. Provisioning of ships and intelligence supplied to ships ’ Masters. I have commented on this in my Intelligence Summary No. 9 paragraph No. 107. I must ask that the proper authority be requested to make it clear to ships’ masters proceeding on this route (i) . that they cannot obtain charts or expert navigational information at this Agency, (ii) . that neither at Muscat, Ras-al-Hadd, Masirah nor Salalah can they obtain water or stores of any kind. I would not make these points if I had not been convinced by ovnpY'i onr»p of +,h*» norofip-ft v of doifHT so. 5 . i write this letter to you with the requests that, if you approve, it be brought before the authority who is responsible for the fate of these ships and that he be asked to correspond with me if he wishes any help locally. Now seems to be the time to take up the question because local arrangements made in haste are bound to be expensive and probably unsatisfactory. My records do not show exactly who the authority in question is. Mr. Lock in Basrah signalled through the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, to me (very approximately) dates of arrival oi the : : ,hips. Sea Tra..sport Officer, Divisional Sea Transport Officer, Basrah, 10th Army and Air Headquarters, Iraq, also appear to be concerned. It would be' better if I could be put in touch with one authority in whose province come the matters under reference. He may further be asked to give, if possible, early and accurate information of the expected 'time of arrival of ships here. g # x would have addressed you on these questions when I got the original reports about them but there seemed no point then in my doing other than report the facts to Mr. Lock - which / I didI did - as the ships were under way and the only thing to do was the best possible with local resources. Y 0 urs sincerely,Office of the Political .gent &amp; Consul, uscat, '%.nk you for your oemi-ofi icial letter I&lt;o. j/99 dated the 8th August, 1942, enclosing your note on His Highness's C sto.^, 2 • As I explained to you I will not have time to take up the question with Ids Highness; nor ao I feel that this moment entirely popitious for me to do so when, as you know, I have j\ut been negotiating for major concessions for the Americans* Incice tally the grant of these will simplify the uestion - reference paragraph 10 of your letter* 5. As a result of our conversations anu the negotiations just mentioned we agre*. d that we should treat the question of the concessions mentioned in paragraph 11 of your letter on the following lines : (i). You will approach the . ultan at a suitable time for the concessions mentioned at your paragraphs ll(i)and (ii)* at 11 (i) offers no problem c*f. your paragraph 5* As for that at paragraph 11(ii) there shoul. be no question of ask for the baggage of personnel to pass 'without p ym#^ of auty'. My view is that such bagg .cge anti all _ _♦ * q * property is free of duty as our Treaty right* The relevant section of the Treaty reads *- 'Customs duties shall not be levied in the territories of the £ ultan on goons produced or manufactured in the territories of ids Majesty or imported by nationals of Lis majesty in the following cases, namely j- ($) On coal ana fuel anm oil,Laval and dr Force provisions am stores am fittings, the property of His majesty, lanae- in the territories of the hultun for the use of the ships of His majesty's Laval rorces and the aircraft of his .dr forces; auty shall, however, be payable if any of the goods thus exempted are sold or otherwise disposed of in the local markets'* You should therefore ask for this concession, i.e. freedom / from decl ration That Jackson, Ls uire, I.P*, Assistant Blilical gent, muscat, halalah*from ueclaxcition or se arch, proceeatng on ths assumption, if ar&amp;' c uestion of duty is raised, thctt none is payable, (ii)Your paragraph ll(iii). fthat I have just written applies, in my view, wholly to N,A» •F»I, troops comfort etc, I do not regard it as arguable that, as our Treaty ri.,hts exist, anj oyal i: Fo ce property is dutiable; even if it were arguable it would be bac policy for us to initiate any distinctions. Once ,uch were .lloweci there is no knowing wi ere they would end, bo that, when the concession unner t. is he ,d is broached, freedom from CiUty is to be assumed as a right, „.s to when the bultan is to be asked to waive declaration and examination of the stores etc, mentioned and carriei- by aircraft - and, I think, any Other Royal Air Force property carried by aircraft - we agre a that this should vnit definition of the status of the United btates ; rmj dr Corps here ;/ho woult. then, we hope, be eligible for the same concession. Should you obtain the concession at paragraph ll(ii) an a ber of United ii&amp;tds Army Corps personnel arrive before their position ic oificially oeiined I hope Myou will be able to obtain for them the sajne treatment as . personnel udei this head, . The position regarair^g British Overseas idrways Corporation will be as lated in your paragraph lo.

As His Highness asked me about it originally I told him tnis morning I had spoken to you ana tnat you were working on the question; which satisfied him. It occurs to me that it may be better to ask him his price for what is wanted. I am sur« you will avoid tsiy appearance of haggligg and I only mention this as tnere was some about the lorry for Eaton and it seems to nave engendered regrettable feelings at the time. ,L Jackson, Esquire, I.P.

Regarding the statement in the letter quoted that “all articles without exception are for the use of the Royal Air Force I would point out that at Salalall petrol was landed in separate quantities consigned separately to the Royal Air Force and to B*0*A.C. and that ships consignment notes showing this were handed by me (as Assistant f olitical Agent) to the Sultan* at Salalah and Masirah the Royal Air Force and &amp;*J,a*C. have separate radio stations; at Calalah the B*0*A*C* stafl insisted that the Royal Air Force should not occupy their buildings. The Sultan is, of course, aware of all this. 6 # i am certain that if the Sultan does not prefer a b for any articles consigned to the Royal Air Force he will ^ under the impression that, as article o paragraph -uCc. oi the Treaty stands, he is allowing it a broad w interpretation, and he will be Justified in taking tnxs believe also his considerable co-operation hat* peon given in tn belief that part of the return for it will be Customs duties on articles other than Royal Air Force property* If he t0 told, without even negotiating, that his treaty rights are to construed so as to yield him no Customs duty I apprehuna serious damage to our relations with him and to our nopes from him of future co-operation. dp Political Agent 4) H.B.M’s Consul, 4uscut&lt;CONFIDENTIAL.
