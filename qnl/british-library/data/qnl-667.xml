I anticipate the following Cavinge in the Budget Grants for the year 1935-36:- PAY OF OFFICERS . — 18,700/- The saving is due to my having been on leave and, on return, to my having officiated as Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3. I anticipate the following Excess expenditure:- PA V OF ESTABLISH tFNT . ^.2,800/- The excess is due to no provision having been made for Leave Salary, to the necessity for pay C 0 *. 155/- a month) for one extra Upper Division Clerk for five months and to pay (^.125/- a month) for one extra '.ower Division Clerk (to understudy Mr. E.E.Thomas, who is proceeding on leave), for whom no provision exists. If the extra Lower Division Clerk is appointed to Bush ire and sent to Bahrain on special duty (as I think is contemplated) the provision of 125/- a month for two months should be omitted. ALLOWANCES AND HONORARIA . Travelling Allowance .. 7,400/- Due to increased touring on the Trueial Coast, Captain2 Captain G.A.Cole’e transfer to Bahrain (vide your telegram No.277 dated the 12th March 1935), Lieutenant-Colonel Loch'fc transfer from Bushire to Bahrain, the Officiating Political Agent’s Summer recess at Karachi, Indian Assistant’s leave, Clerks' leave and transfers, the coming of new Clerks and to Captain Cole's leave in March 1930. SUPPLIES AMD SERVICES . Launch Allowance •• •• •• ^.1,000/- The excess is due to the increased use of the launch. C :NT FNQKNCIES . (i) Postage and Telegram Charges •• •• 13,000/- Due to Qatar and Trucial Coast affairs, Transit Dues, Ca'udi Arabian boundary, Air Route and Oil negotiations. I would add that every endeavour is made to use the Air Mail, but that extreme urgency and the fact that addressees(for example, Jedda) are not on the air route often preclude doing so. (ii) Office Allowance •• •• •• ^2,000/- ^ Excess expenditure due to the appointment of an \ Assistant Political Agent and to a general increase of office activities. (iii) Central Contract Grant •• •• .. ^.2,000/- ^ Due to the Agency building being old and needing continual repairs and a number of small alterations having to be carried out. I should explain that the Agency is so old and is constructed of such rude material that comparatively heavy expenditure is needed if it is to be kept in reasonably presentable condition. For example, the corroding salts in the material and damp sea air make it necessary to whitewash very frequently. 4. I regret the delay in submitting this review, which isJT in l&lt;A? m*: - 3 - which is due to my having had to go on tour immediately on my return to Bahrain and only having got back on the 6th November 1935.

TW Order, Secretary to th^rolitical Resident in the/Rersian Oulf.1 , Mi Political Agency, Bahrain the 6th January 1937• '?ir 154 &gt; From c To Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. ^he Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• Sir, I have the honour to refer to paragraph 3 of your memorandum No. 2418/60/23 dated the 30th November 1936 in which you ask for information about the additional provision asked for under the heads 'Office Allowance', 'Launch Grant' and 'Central Contract Grant'• 2. The increase of expenditure in the various grants is due to the change of circumstances in Bahrain. The original grants were fixed over a decade ago, when Bahrain was a backwater. Vy pre decessor , after discussion with the Honourable the Political Resident postponed proposals for an increase in the grants owing to the financial crisis (see x A v • his letter No. 1652 dated the 23rd November 1930). Since then there has been a great increase ir the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, the air route has been opened, the Trucial Coast has been placed informally under the Political Ajrent, Bahrain, and an Assistant Political Agent has been appointed. A naval base has, moreover, been establishedat Jufair. All these developments have increased the expenditure of the Agency to varying degrees and the prices of commodities and labour have risen considerably. 3. Office Allowance. The extra expenditure involved under the head office allowance is due to the increased activities of the Agency and the rise in prices. Menials have to be paid more to prevent desertion to the Oil Companies, extra telephones have had to be installed for the Assistant Political Agent and for the Indian Assistants Court, furniture has bad to be obtained for the Office of the Assistant Political Agent and extra clerks, the price of, for example, menials uniforms has risen, the building is getting older and more delapidated,necessitating more patching. The increase in the number of patients attending the Hospital has necessitated the purchase of more medical supplies. With the increase in personnel there is a proportionate increase in such charges as Electric Installation, liveries and especially office contingencies. 4. Launch Grant. The launch is being increasingly used both for long trips, for example, to the pearl banks and to the Qatar Coast and for meeting the growing number of visitors to the Agency. I hope, however, by means of various economies to make the launch grant suffice in future years. 5. Central Contract Grant. The Aprency uilding is old and in a very shaky condition. Itis built in local style and has reached a state in which continual repairs are essential if serious results are to be avoided. It will be remembered, for example, that when the Honourable the Political Rpsident was last at Bahrain a large portion of the courtyard verandah plaster fell just after he had left in a car; the kitchen verandah plastering recently collapsed within a few yards of my cook; during the recent rains the kitchen has flooded out owing to the gradual decay of the roof and cooking had to be done in a comer f a verandah. Apart from these larger items, bits and pieces are continually coming adrift and requiring attention. The fact is that a new building is really required, but if continually and carefully patched the existing building can be made to last seme time yet. % I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lieutenant-C 0 1one1 Political Agent, BahrainTelegrsun From *o G #T • C • Political Agent, Bahrain.

The present Office Allowance Grant is inadequate to meet the whole year's expenditure. In 1930 TTajor C.G.Prior put forward a proposal to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in t he Persian Gulf with a view to increasing the Office Allowance grant but owing to the financial crisis the Political Resident did npt consider it feasible to approach the Government of India on the subject (see his letter ? T o. 1652 dated the 23rd November 1930)• The question was again taken up by Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch in 1936 vide his letter No. 42-4/4 dated the 6th January 1937. The excess includes Rs. 1,108-10-0 on account of the cost of tents indented by Captain Hickinbotham for the use of the Hon’ble the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrain on the Trucial Coast. One result of the Efcbara trouble has been that the Bahrain Government have issued orders prohibiting public launchesVJ-t &amp; 3. launches from plying between Qatar and Bahrain. Consequently for the despatch of each letter from this Agency to the Kuler of Qatar a special launch lias to be hired and this costs about Hs. 100/- to Hs* 120/- per trip. This has further increased the expenditure under Office Allowance. POSTAGE AND TELEGRAM CHARGES . Excess .

By order Secretary to the Political 'Resident in the Persian Gulf.Political Agency, lahrain,the 1st December 1937• From H# /eightrrian Ksquire I.C*S., Political gent, Bahrain* To The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Pers'an Gulf Bushire• Sir, ith reference to your memorandum N • 2109/60/43 dated the 29th Cctober 1937, I have the honour to state that the present office Allowance grant of Rs 15,100/- which was fixed for this Agenc ' in 1923, is no longer adequate for its growing needs- 1 attach a statement showing how the grant has hitherto been sub divided , together with actuals for three years and my ronesals year i*e. iis 500/- per mensem. The scale of pay drawn by the junior peons is its 20-1-30. The senior peons, garde ners and sweepers draw ns 35 to ^ 40/-. These .ages may app ar high connared with salaries drawn by menials in consulates and Agencies in the &lt;nilf hut are lo i for Bahrain where an unskilled cooly can earn as much as one rupee a day in the Bahrain Petroleum Company and where a local nan with a very superficial Knowledge of Arabic and English can expect a salary of Hs 60/- a month. I'y predecessor was compelled to give abnormal advance increments to peons in order to retain them in service* for the future* 1 deal below with each sub head seriatim Pay of onial ; .’stablishment The allotment under this sub head is as 6,000 a “iirthermore- -—- • - / /T' - 2 - Furthermore, owing to the appointment of an ASv^istant Political Agent, Bahrain and the transfer of tie Indian Assistant's Court to a separate building the number of peons has had to be increased* Finally un to April 1937 the Bahrain Government supplied two orderlies to work in the Agency on local dak duty* This privilege has been withdrawn by the Bahrain Government end it has been necessary to engage two extra 'bicycle peons' 1 for this purpose* This allotment should be increased to Rs. 6,500/- a year at least* Toshakhana The annual allotment is fixed at Rs. 200/- a year. The Trucial Coast has been informally placed under the control of the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Political Agent therefore has had to give presents when he goes on tour to the Trucial Coast. The sum of Rs. 200/- is inadequate to meet the charges and the allotment should be increased to Rs. 300/-. Marine Stores present no additional funds are required under this sub-head. Contimrencies The following items are debited to contingencies: Subscription to newspapers and periodicals, cost of books, registers, rent of telephones, cost of printing invitation cards for 'Mew Year' and 'ring’s Birthday? cost of printing forms e.g. Mo Objection Certificate, Liquer permit, Printed letters, applications for Mo Objection Certificate, Judicial forms for Court etc., launch hire to atar, cost of cycles for office, washing charges for liveries (summer) of peons, cost of polish for peons and flit for Office^ft k i 4 cost of candles materes stationery loeally bought* cost of office clocks etc.,. The increase of expenditure under this sub- I head is due to the change of circumstances in ahrain and increase of work in,' this Agency. Owing to the opera tions of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Conce ssions Limited and to the establishment of a Naval Base at Jufair all prices in Bahrain have risen ,thus adversely affecting Tf Office Contingencies”. The installation of telephones, which are undoubte ly essential, - dds further debits in the ‘orm of rent* An additional sum o^* ^ 700/- is re uired under this sub- head* Hot and Cold C harges The e penditure under this sub- head has decreased with the installation of electric fans* The allotment can be reduced to nls 100/- • Purchase of Furniture It should be possible now to reduce average expenditure under this sub - head and an allotment of Hs 300/- will be sufficient • Liveries The actual cost of liveries for the present peons and sweeper amounts to an avei’age of hs 350/- per annum and an addlticfcn of hs 150/- under this sub' ead is therefore necessary. Electric Installation There was no electricity in Bahrain in 1923 when the total o Tice allowance rant was 'ixed at Hs 15,100. The present allotment under n Electric InstallationIInstallation*’ is insufficient anion the basis of three years actuals an additional sum of as 500/- is required under this head. T.A. to Establishment - , 500. Wo v that the Oovem ient of India have san- 0 ctioned the recess of the Assistant Political Agent at Karachi during the summer months, and that the Political Agent and Assistant Political Agent are required to tour frequen ly on the Crucial Coast as th result of oil and air developments more money is req ired to m et the Tra velling Allowance of enial Establishment who accompany o ficers. The actuals for 193b-37 are illusory owing to the fact that the Political Agent did not visi . the Trucial Coast Here at least an addition of ns 100/- is required. Repairs to building As all repairs should be carried out from the Central Contract Grant there is no justification for main taining this sub - head. Judicial x he allotment is reasonable. It is impossible to reduce it since the Indian Assistant's Court has been established. ?4edical Charges There has been a great increase in the number of patients and the grant has been overspent during the last four years by an average o' roughly .o 750 annually. There should In due course , be a reduction of expenditureexpenditure unoer this head when the new Bahrain Govern ment ''os^ital is complete, but provision must be made for the intedm, and in any case Indians and other foreigners to Bahrain are likely to maintain their connection with the Agency Hospital indefinitely. For the time being it m’ght be possible to carr ' on with an addition, of hs 500/- und r this head* Repatriation of destitute Indians increase in expenditure under this head and prefer' not to reduce the allotment of fis 300/- in spite of past actuals. I trust that the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the *ersian Gulf will be good enough to support this application 1 shou d be inclined to anticipate an The net result of these proposals is an increase in the grant from .b 15,100/- to * 17000/- and and to request the Government of indie to increase grant ac ordingly.
