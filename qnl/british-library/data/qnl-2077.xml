Dear Sir Rupert Hay, British Council Visitors. 1948/49. 1. I am wiriting to inform you that in the British Council Budget for 1948/49 the sum of £150 (one hundred and fifty pounds) has been allocated towards the expenses of a visitor from Bahrain, or froiii any of the territories with which you are concerned in the Persian Gulf. 2. This sum is sufficient to cover a visit and conducted tour in the U.K. for about six weeks, the British Council being responsible for all expenses and arrangements, but it does not cover any fares to or from the U.K. * 3. Apart from general sight-seeing and visiting, the British Council Visitors 1 Department is able to arrange, through its staff and through its Advisory Committees, for the visitor to meet the leading British representatives of his own profession or trade and to visit any special institutions in which he is interested. In recent years the British Council has received a considerable number of visitors from Middle East countries, and as a general rule these visits are much appreciated and have a valuable influence. 4. As you are doubtless aware, a visitor, to justify subsidization by the British Council, should be a person of standing in his profession or trade and likely to exert in his own sphere a considerable influence which may be strengthened and widened by a visit to jshe U.K.. It is very desirable that he should have a good or sufficient knowledge of English to get the best out of his contacts and visits in the U.K. 6» For your information I enclose a copy of a form which we ask our overseas Representatives to have filled in for any visitors recommended by them. It is not essential that this form should be filled in by any visitor recommended by you, but we • should naturally be grateful for some information on the post, influence and chief interests of any person nominated by you, particularly in order to allow us to have some standard of comparison with other Middle East visitors. i N 6. These visits are costly, and the British Council much regrets that it cannot this year offer to pay the fares to and from the U.K. We very much hope that you'may be able to recommend a visitor who would appreciate and profit by such a visit, and who would also be able to pay his own fares. 7. I should remind you that academic visits should be arranged before early June or after mid September and school teachers should not come in August. Owing to the Olympic Games this year in London at the beginning of August, this month is also particularly difficult in which to find accommodation. Lt. Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., The Political Representative, Bahrain, Persian Gulf .m M - 2 - 6) 8. In view of the probability that you would wish a visitor from Bahrain to come to England in the summer months, we should be grateful for any nominations you would be kind enough to make at your earliest convenience, and vie shdl be most grateful for jugc your advice and assistance in this matter.

I enclose a copy of a letter from the Assistant Director, Middle East Department of the British Council to Sir Rupert Hay, and its enclosure. I spoke to you about this subject and we agreed that Shaikh Khalifa bin Mohd. should be nominated as the visitor to Great Britain under the British Council scheme. Would you kindly fill up the form for him and return it to me as soon as possible? Would you also kindly confirm that Shaikh Khalifa's fares to and from the United King dom will be the liability of the Bahrein Government? You will doubtless arrange that the dates proposed for his visit do not clash with those of His Highness 1 absence during the summer. Yours sincerely, C .B.

It seemed to me that the Secretary of the Manama L!uricipality, Sadiq (I think) by name, was a man exercising considerable authority and worthy of support and would be a suitable person to visit England did an opportunity arise. The Secretsry of the Maharraq Municipality is younger - probably more impressionable but he had not last November been con firmed in his appointment. Naturally I make the suggestion in f Reference to the Adviser's opinion. 3. I can think of no one from Kuwait, my impression being that they were all sufficiently wealthy to provide for any visit they wanted. I think too that any visit for tech nical purposes such as from the newly reformed Post Office w would preferably be missions from the Governments concerned. 4. I am hoping that the inclusion of one or two headmast from Bahrain may be possible for a course during the sumner but we hade had no news of it. If it does not take place this year - next year I might be in England myself and give them some help. 5. You may rest assured that whoever is chosen will be given a very good welcome and be given every opportunity of visiting places. It has in my experience subways beer well done.

He was particularly struck during his study of police work with the latest methods of crime detection and with the efficiency, economy in man power, and urobtrusiv neas afforded by the proper use of motor transport and radio by the police. Some of the ideas he obtained on this and kindred sub jects seem a bit advanced for introduction in Bahrain; but I am sure the visit was successful generally in broadening Shaikh Khalifah's outlook and particularly in giving him an idea as to how a police force ought to be run.
