P olitical D epartment, From, The Commissioner in SiNd. To, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. C ommissioner's O ffice, Kurrachee, Srd September 1870. Sir, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt to-day of your letter of the 30th August, forwarding reports and intelligence from Captain Hamson, Political A^ent at Khelat. As to the title Khan of Buloochistan,' Captain Harrison reports that the Khan did not designate himself so, it was only made use of by Captain Harrison him self. It is very unnecessary therefore for you to entertain any further distrust in the matter, oi, as you say ' the opinion that the Khelat Government had a design in adopting it, although Captain Harrison does not know it.' As the Khelat Government neu i did adopt the title, it is difficult to detect any design, and very natural that Captain Harrison should not be aware of it. 3. The very proper answer sent by His Highness the Khan to the Seistan Sirdars in reply to this appeal to him-for assistance, and which was forwarded by you, ought to have been sufficient to remove from your mind the very needless apprehension you had formed that the Khan had designs on Seistan. It was clear from the very first, that such intentions were not in the least likely to be entertained by His Highness, and had you viewed the matter with a calm and unprejudiced mind, you would have been spared the trouble of recording surmises so unsuitable to the occasion, both before and again now in the letter under reply. 4. With reference to the 8th para, of your letter, I am sorry to see still displayed by you a system of adverse criticism of the acts of the Political Agent at Khelat, which is becoming to neither you to apply, or him to undergo. Captain Harrison in Jus Diary merely states that during the past week there had been ' perfect quiet,' he does not attempt to speak of the future, or say that the quiet is permanent, and was manifestly unaware at that time of the Murree raid you mention. I cannot therefore see the necessity or propriety of your remarks on the subject. I have, &amp;c., W, L. MEREWETHER, Colonel, Commissioner in SinJ.( 8 ) No. 562 of 1870. Political Department. Commissioner's Office, Kurrachee, Sth September 1870. Submitted to Government in continuation of previous correspondence. W. L.
