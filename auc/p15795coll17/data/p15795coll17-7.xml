He was brought to the attention of AUC trustees seeking to rebuild the board, and after joining he recruited others.  As chairman of the search committee for President Raymond McLain’s successor, Barco was responsible for the hiring of Thomas A. Bartlett.  Barco tells of AUC’s relationship with the United States government, especially the receipt of PL480 program Egyptian Pound funds, outlining the role of and his interactions with diplomats, State Department officials, and members of Congress.  He covers other fundraising efforts (such as approaches to old trustees) and financial issues, including the role of New York Office personnel in those and other operations of the university. Barco’s participation in meetings with Egyptian officials after the 1967 War leading to AUC’s reopening is mentioned. He describes board committees as largely inactive. No audio is available for the interview; the transcript consists of notes taken from the interviewer’s memory soon after the interview.
