INDIA OFFICE B. 401. JF. 4(H5D/28. Lighting and Buoying of the Persian Gulf, 1908-1928. I.—First Reconstruction : 1909-14. 1. For many years before 1904 the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf had been left almost entirely to private enterprise. The British India Steam Navigation Company were principally concerned with such arrangements as existed, and in 1909 were maintaining 15 buoys and one beacon (at Bahrein) in the Gulf. The Government of India had erected one beacon at Has al Araz, Koweit, and the Belgian Customs Administration one at Ras al Marg, Bushire ; some sporadic buoying had also been carried out. Turkish lights and buoys were maintained at the head of the Gulf. The question of regulating the service was, however, brought into prominence by the increase of German and Turkish activities in the Gulf early in the century. In 1907, for instance, the Hamburg-Amerika Company proposed to contribute to the upkeep of the British India Steam Navigation Company’s buoys, and as this seemed to be the beginning of a political move it was suo-crested that the British Government should take ovei the whole seiviee. oo 2. The Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence in their Report of the 20th January 1909, having learned from evidence given that the lighting, &amp;c.. in the Gulf was unsatisfactory, supported a recommendation already made by the Government of India that a Commission should be sent to the' Gulf to' collect information with a view to improving conditions at small cost. A Committee of Enquiry was appointed and reported on the 29th April 1909 ; they recommended a large reorganisation, detailed in a supplementary report. o. It was decided that Government should undertake responsibility for the service, and long correspondence ensued between the Home Departments concerned and with the Government of India. By 1912 the following programme of reconstruction had been worked out and sanctioned ; 3 lighthouses at Musandim (Little Quoin), Tamb, and Sheikh Shuaib. 1 lightvessel outside the Shatt-el-Arab. 6 lighted buoys (Bushire 2, Bahrein 2, Bander Abbas and Shatt-el- Arab). 3 unlit buoys (together with certain buoys taken over from the British India Steam Navigation Company). 1 lighthouse tender. 1 lighthouse depot. 4. Meanwhile the obstructive activities of the Turkish authorities continued and counterbuoying was carried on by them, especially in the Shatt-el-Arab. It is unnecessary, however, to consider these activities in detail, since by the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, which was awaiting ratification on the outbreak of war, the Ottoman Government undertook, while reserving Turkish territorial rights, not to oppose measures which His Majesty’s Government might carry out in respect of surveys, lighting, buoying or pilotage. 5. The main features of the programme of reconstruction were carried out in 1912-14. Lighted buoys for Bushire, Bahrein and Bander Abbas were sent out from this country in June and September 1912. A lighted buoy had already in 1911 been placed at the outer bar of the Shatt. Unlit buoys were manufactured in India. The Tamb light was exhibited in July 1913, the Little Quoin light in January 1914. The Shatt-el-Arab light- vessel was despatched to the Gulf and established in April 1914 ; a protest was made by the Turkish Government against its establishment, but it was pointed out that the ship was 10 miles outside the bar, and not in Turkish territorial waters. The lighthouse tender, named Ncarchus, was built and sailed for India in December 1914. (The despatch vessel R.I.M.S. Lawrence 3074 75 10.28 A P. 2680/07.

A convenient source of oil supply was at hand in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 0 The only parts of the programme not completed were (a) the Sheikh Shuaib light, \b) the lighthouse depot. These are dealt with below. Notifications of the various aids to navigation were given from time to time to mariners and in some cases to foreign Consular representatives. In ju n e 1914 the Political Resident was instructed to issue a complete notification of all changes and improvements to the Local Government at Bushire and the Customs authorities, and to keep both them and the Consular representatives informed of future developments.

Masthead lights on the Henjam and Ohahbar telegraph stations, like those already in existence at Jask, were exhibited in 1914. 8. In 1913-4 the Political Resident proposed a general overhaul of beacons. The following beacons were to be maintained:—Koweit (Ras-al- Arz), Bushire (Ras-al-Marg), Jask, Henjam and Basidu. New beacons were to be built at Kubbar (near Koweit), Khor Kaliya (near Bahrein) and Halul. That at Halul was to be erected not so much to aid navigation as to establish a foothold against Turkish and German designs; the ownership of the island being, as will be seen from the memorandum on page ||, undecided, though there are some grounds for considering it under Abu Dhabi. All the proposals were sanctioned by the early part of 1914. 9. Later in the same year the question arose of the ownership of certain islands off the coast between Koweit and Bahrein, and, mainly for political reasons, beacons which might help, if necessary, to establish a claim to ownership were sanctioned, and set up in 1915, on the islands of harsi, Arabi and Harkus. 10. The beacon at Henjam (Ras-al-Mashia) was restored in 1917, and a light placed on it. That at Halul was removed from charts, &amp;c., on a report from R.I.M.S. Neai'chus in 1923. 11. In 1917 the Government of India represented that lighthouses at Muscat, Henjam and Sheikh Shuaib were “an urgent necessity.” Alight for Muscat was immediately sanctioned and erected ; it was removed to another position in 1926. A temporary lighthouse was erected at Henjam (Ras-al-Mashia) in 1920, and another at Jask. The Sheikh Shuaib project again failed to mature (see IV (d)), but a temporary lightship was established, as a substitute, off Kais Island in 1918, and was replaced by a semi permanent vessel in 1923. 12. Shatt-el-Arab. —In 1916-7 a general reorganisation of the buoying of the river entrance was carried out for war purposes. The channel was marked by three gas buoys and eight unlit buoys. Shortly after the war, however, the lighting and buoying of the Shatt-el-Arab was taken over by the Basra Port Directorate and ceased to be the concern of the Government of India. 13. Lighthouse Depot. —The original scheme of reconstruction provided for a depot at Koweit, but Abadan island was found to be more suitable. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were willing in 1912 to lease an area, but no progress was made before the war. During the war the Company s trade expanded, and the offer of the area selected for a depot was withdrawn ; the lighting service w r as, however, allowed to remain at Abadan temporarily. In 1921 the Government of India proposed to unite with the Basra Port authorities in a joint depot at Fao. This was sanctioned in 1922. F.O. to I.O., May 2 1924, 1’. 1995/24. 14. In 1923 the lighthouse tender Nearchus was declared unfit for service, and her sale was authorised in 1924. She was replaced by the new R.I.M.S. Lawrence, w’hich combined the duties of despatch vessel and tender.15. The last five years have been too much taken up with administrative and financial readjustments to permit of any extensive developments in the service. The most pressing needs at the moment, however, are said to be the replacement of the light vessel oiT Kais Island and the establishment of a lighthouse at Ras-al-Hadd. The desirability of the latter has been represented on several occasions by individual merchant ships and by the Merchant Service Guild. III.—Administration and Finance. 16. The question of raising light dues from vessels using the Gulf, to pay for the maintenance of the service, was considered before the war. But it was decided that such a course would be impossible “ without the consent of the Powers whose flags are flown by the vessels navigating the Gulf, and such consent would not be forthcoming except on-conditions implying that very international control which it is the aim of His Majesty’s Government to exclude.” The whole cost of the service (about £30,000 to £40,000 a year) was therefore borne in equal shares by Imperial and Indian revenues, all fresh expenditure exceeding £100 requiring the prior sanction of His Majesty’s Government. Subject to this control, the Government of India were responsible for administration; during the period (1912-4) of reconstruction the Political Resident was ex-officio “ Inspector of Lights,” with the Commander of R. f.M.S. Lawrence as Assistant Inspector. In 1915 the inspectorship was transferred to the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, who, under the Government of India, was thenceforth responsible for the maintenance of the Service. The commander of the tender remained Assistant Inspector of Lights, and was expected to consult the Political Resident on all political matters in connection with the lights. 17. After the war, with the elimination of Turkish and German interests in the Gulf, His Majesty’s Government were anxious to divest themselves of financial commitments, and in 1923 an inter-departmental conference recommended that light dues should be levied at Basra and Abadan. It was ascertained that in 1922 96 per cent, of the shipping which crossed the Shatt-el-Arab bar was British. The British shipping interests were consulted, and it was agreed that an Advisory Committee should be formed of commercial and shipping representatives to work in partnership with the Government of India in the administration of the new Lighting and Buoying Fund ; the Iraq Government agreed to levy the dues, which wore put into force (at the rate of 3 annas a ton, since reduced to 14 annas a ton) on the 1st November 1925. His Majesty’s Government agreed to contribute £5,000 a year for five years, subject to review at the end of that period. Admiralty tankers were to be exempted from dues. No law has been passed by the Iraq Government to provide for the levy, but it appears that the dues are satisfactorily collected at Basra and Abadan, without real legal authority, by the Port Directorate. 18. Since 1st January 1927, the Port Directorate have been employed by the Government of Indians “contractors” for the Gulf lights. Instead of R.I.M.S. Lawrence being used as tender, Nearchus, which was apparently sold to the Port authorities, has returned to her old employment. The vessel flies a British flag outside Iraq territorial waters. 19. This has enabled considerable economies to be made, and the bund is now in a comparatively prosperous state. In October 1927, full power was given to the Government of India to manage the fund entirely without reference to His Majesty’s Government, under the arrangements made with the shipping interests.

Ihe 1 ersian Government, however on enquiry, disclaimed any intention of the sort and said that they would certainly consult His Majesty s Government before taking such a step. . . „ (d) Sheikh Shdaib.— This island was one of those originally chosen for a lighthouse. It was recognised that since the is and was undoubted \ them in lyil, mil repuitcu tuan « authorise the erection of a lighthouse under their own auspices. As tins would undermine the British supremacy in matters of lighting ami nught involve financial difficulties if dues were subsequently levied, it was decided to drop the project altogether. In 1917, the matter was raised again by the Government of India, who proposed to erect a light without consulting the Persian Government; but various delays supervened and it was not till 1923 that the Government of India stated that they were anxious to proceed with the construction. They thought, however, that prior reference to the Persian Government would in present circumstances be necessary. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran reported in November 1923 that on raising the question he had been informed of the intention ol the Persian Ministry of War to arrange for the erection themselves. Ihus 1 lis Majesty s Government and the Government of India found themselves in exactly the same position as in 1912. Any such scheme for Persian control was strongly deprecated by the Secretary of State, though the Government of India were inclined to favour it. The Political Resident suggested an alternative light on Nabiyu Farur, but it was decided that, other objections apart, the status of the island was such that a prior reference to the Persian Government would be necessary before a liffht could be established. The question of the Sheikh Shuaib lighthouse was accordingly dropped once more. V.—Conclusions. 21. It appears that the lighting and buoying of the Gulf has been efficiently carried out since the assumption of responsibility by the Govern ment of India, and it has been almost entirely to British activity that the larger vessels using the Gulf (of which the overwhelming majority are British) are indebted for the existing aids to navigation. 22. The Persian Government has never been in a position to maintain an effective service and has never played any constructive part. The proposals for Persian construction at Sheikh Shuaib and in the Gulf generally (see IV (/&gt;) and {d)) have been based on the employment of British personnel and British money. 23. In the Memorandum, of the 1st March 1922 to the United States Government the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said “ The Persian Hulf has for more than a century been the scene of active British influenceSI v and a predominant British trade. Piracy has been suppressed, the slave trade has been abolished, the waters have been lighted and buoyed and order has been preserved by the exertions of Great Britain.” 24. So far as lighting and buoying is concerned, it has always been the aim of His Majesty’s Government to maintain their supremacy against foreign encroachment, and it is on the efficiency of the service and the lack of alternative organisation, together with the desirability of unified control, that the strongest arguments for the continuance of the present arrangements can be based. 25. The main avenues for possible encroachment by the Persian Government appear to be (a) the Shatt-el-Arab and Abadan, (b) the places such as Bushire, Henjam, Sheikh Shuaib, Ac., on the Persian side of the Gulf, (c) the islands and ports on the Arabian side to which Persia lays claim, or the status of which is indeterminate (see Memorandum on Status of certain Groups of Islands, on page 26. J'he Political Resident in the Gidf has reported that the subject is one in which the Persian authorities have recently shown interest, and that they have spoken to him on the subject of the buoys at Bushire He adds— “ The latter [the Bushire buoys] might be within the power of control of the Italian officer who is to be in charge of their new Preventive Service Launch, but the main question of lighting and buoying is beyond their capacity, and they could probably not pay for, nor would the} 7, efficiently keep up, a lightship such as that at Kais island. It is quite certain that we could not willingly leave our shipping to be dependent upon the vagaries of a Persian system of lighthouses. The danger would be too great, and the Persian has got to show greater capacity for organisation and maintenance before we could agree to such a proposal.” 27. The Government of India have indicated that in their view retention by His Majesty’s Government of responsibility for the lighting and buoying of the Gulf is indispensable. India Office, m. J.
