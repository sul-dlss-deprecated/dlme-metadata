Following is amended text of message^for communication to King Hussein. Please have it delivered imciedlately (Beginning of 'R'). His Majesty's Government have seen with great regret that their message to Your Highness has been misunderstood Put realise that amid the anxieties ano. preoccupations which the great task of Arab liberation imposes on Your Highness, such misunderstandings are apt to arise. Their confidence in Your Highness 1 loyalty and sincerity uas been shown oy their constant and unfailing support during the last two years, even as tave Your Highness' splendid efforts demonstrated Your Highness' confidence in them. The message referred to was delivered in Your Highness' own interests and in order to prevent a public calamity Which rf * which would discredit the whole Arab movement abroad, injure Your Highness’ position, and gravely endanger the prospects of Ai-ab unity. His Majesty 1 ^ Government note with satisfaction that . Your Highness expressed a similar opinion to Colonel Wilson and that you realise the necessity of concentrating all your forces against the Turks, They fuliy believe your assurances made to Colonel Wilson that you have no intention of doing more than restoring order in Khuima, At the same time Your Highness knows that there are mischievous people who for their own ends would be glad to see trouble between Your Highness and Ibn Baud and that Turkish influence is probably behind them. His Majesty’s Government having Arab interests sincerely at heart feel themselves bound most seriously to beg Your Highness to exercise patience while they bring all possible means to bear upon Ibn Baud to induce him to restrain his followers and confine his activities to the North and East. His Majesty’s Government feel that having regard to your great position in the eyes of the world it would be a gracious act for Your Highness to send a friendly letter through British channels to Ibn Baud,. informing him that the \ expeditionexpedltXoa out' Hivghness' has seat to Knurma is not in any way an aggressive act against him hut has been necessitated hy the proximity of Khurma to your capital, and proposing an Immediate and friendly settlement. His Majesty’s Government are convinced that mutual friendship and confidence can he restored hy these means and thus the prospect cf Arab unity he greatly advanced* His Majestyhs .Government- cannot regard seriously * .{ a decision to abdicate taken hy Yo^^-Higimesm under a mistaken impression that Yfour Highness ma lost the confidence of His Majesty r s Government. As stated above far from this bfeing the case His Majesty's Government regard your leadership of the Arab movement in .war as vitally necessary for the Arab cause and cannot think that Your- Highness will withdraw at such a juncture. EUch an act would imperii the destiny of millions who regard your victory as the guarantee of their deliverande and would be a triumph for those •■.i -i- intriguers who desire to see the Arabian people cond&amp;nned to a further period of Turkish servitude.

He then showed Colonel Wilson a letter from one of his Sheikhs giving particulars of a caravan which had been captured by t Sherifial tribesmen on its way from Hail to Medina: and ' it affirmed his behalf that Ibn Saud’s assurances were not genuine. He mentioned that Ibn Saud was levying the 'Zeka' (religious) tax on the Ateibah tribesmen subject to the ♦ Hedjaz, and said that, according to his information, the present political situation in Nejd, Qasim and the Koweit districts was very unsatisfactory. He said that, Mndful of the fact that Ibn Saud was our ally, he had carefully avoided all cause of friction, and asked Colonel Wilson to that he should maintain his present non-committal, though A state definitely whether His Majesty’s Government desired Right Honourable friendly, A,J.

Questioned- as to the Kurma incident (see my telegram N0.515M. of 25th May) the King explained that the Sheikh of Kurma (a member of the Ashraf) had turned Wahabi and denounced King Hussein's rule, thus causing a division amongst the inhabitants. A deputa tion of the local Sherifial party had subsequently &gt; - - r ' visited Mecca and asked for assistance and protection. The King instructed them to separate themselves, with their flocks and herds, from the Kurma 'rebels' and also sent a small force to police the district and give security to the 'loyalists'. The latter, in the meantime and before the arrival of the Sherifial troops, had driven out the Sheikh of Kurma and released two of the King's emissaries whom he had inprisoned. The Kihg i • • ' . v ( attributed the whole affair to malign Wahabite' influence. ( King Hussein’s strong prejudice against the „ ,, ^ — — ■ Emir of Nejd is so evident that we have hitherto discounted his allegations against* the Emir’s good faith. At the same time there is no reason to suppose that the M.ng has made and repeated these allegations, knowing them to be false: and our recent information as to the increase of caravan traffic f between Koweit and Syria (see my telegram No«910 of June 6th), and a circumstantial report from Aden about an agreement t « * &lt; &lt; * * %, &lt;» t *1 ' ' ! l ^ agreement between Ibn Saud and the Turks regarding the opening up of communications with the Yemen, suggest the advisability of instituting careful inquiry from Mesopo tamia about Ibn Saud 1 s present commercial and political activities.

J_ . - I To the Noble, Eminent Personage, Descendant of the pure lineage of Hashlm, the good Emir and the kind help, our Master and Father, Hie Highness Sherif Hussein Ibn Ali, Emir and Sherif of Mecca, may God preserve him and ' ■ , \ - r » grant him his benevolent hopes and all good intentions* Amen* Sinceie greetings and good salaams to your good kind self. I beg to write this to ask for your health. Our situation is, thank God, all right and pleases you in all ' '' . r r 1 respects. Nothing has happened which is worth mentioning to Your Highness. I have received your cordial letter most respectfully and understood its contents. As regards stimulating us against the friends and their cousins, I think you have been told false informations about them. Most people say right things intending to show things as wrong 'If the utterer is ignorant the listener may not lie'. How could we dare prevent ourselves from performing the dutiful matters which we should do and how is it that we order five Bedouins and tell them to do such and such a thing. This is a thing you yourself should know and realise, as it is not in favour of our religion or policy. I have told you of the original case through your delegate 'Buqeiran' and informed you of all what has happened lest events may occuh. The wicked continued their evils till they took their cousins minors, unlawfully plundered the rights and killed the men. I am, thank God, not weak. All are under my order and in my hand. I can deal with them alright and can have the right from them. By God, I only left them alone r , owingM I- Zing to two reams. Firstly I feared to help them because that my mke them lose their right agains ; El Amidi 'arid the like and people will say that Saud intends something against Amidi. r Secondly because I do not'like that peace amongst the Arabs may be cut off whatever it may cost. For pfcc.ee an security confirm the Arabs and preserve the weak. _ ... Here are Ibn Shalyweeh and El Khamas fighting since ' 3 vears and nothing has been said about them. But both are wicked and are friends of the devil and the satan whose work never succeeds. Some day they are wicked killing souls and plundering money and properties and make evils in the world. Another day they leaye. the evils, turn back towards God and obeyed .His orders and'those of His Prophet, may peace and prayer of God r v ’ {* • f ) • ) J X tie upon Him. ' You know that I never expect any reward or thanks ' from them. But he who comes to me saying that he is obeying God I should be ready to sacrifice my money and myself for his sake. On the other hand you realise that God authorised me to rule Nejd and examined me by being afflicted with calamities, and many people,, but God saved me from them and assisted me against every wicked rascal- Arab or otherwise. Nobody is against me. There may be some ignorant one who may say something against me more than what he says against you. We part from everyone who does not obey God and His Prophet, and who considers anybody an infidel has to prove this otherwise he himself will be infidel. He who transgresses the order of God is as well infidel. But I see that people sore somewhat unjust. For how * many religions in ‘the world “there are! Chris“tianit»y, Jewish, Sahianity, Idolatry and Magianity (?). None of these were ever cursed except the M Wahhabiah w (they only avenged i ravenged them to hell eve in God the Most Almighty;. You become excited and give heed to- the words of an ignorant fool Bedouin who utters false sayings. Our Ulema and we, God forbid, do not consider infidel whom God did not make so. Yes whoever is said by God and His Prophet to be an infidel, we consider infidel and who ever is said to be impious we consider impious and whoever is said to be Moslem we say he is Moslem. This, may God preserve you, is not a matter of right of property that we can deal with according our disposal. If the matter is difficult for you to solve, here are the Book of God, the traditions of the Prophet, may peace and prayer of God be upon him, the sayings of his friends the good virtuous ancestors and these'who'are following them on the right way up till the day of Judgment. You are nowadays in the place of the Father, The Ulema of Mecca refer to the Ulema of Nejd and discuss religious matters in the Cause of God. You and I, God willing, may be right and will be together assisting each other against the wrong. But, may God preserve your j-ile, we wish to look into the matter in short. If the people of the Hedjaz especially those of Mecca have considered that the H Wahhabians H are infidels and declared this openly and generally and if they also announced this in the Holy House $f God on the stage o^ lectures and speeches, we never became excited, but only said (there is no strength or power but in God). If we . .. • r ; ' • • ( &lt; are considered to be wrong and the fault is ours, we only say (God is sufficient for us and is the best reckoner). We have a good exarrple in the true and the righteous one, may peace and prayer of God be upon him, for he has been deemed to be liar and was treated in the way known to everybody and was called a magician and sorcerer etc. But may God preserve your life, there are two ways to be dealt , with ~ rf a FTW IjO V% with in this question. Either to discuss those religious points. The right is clear and to whatever direction it appears we have to follow it r otherwise both you and us will be obliged to follow what has happened amongst those nations and sects whethei &amp; right or wrong. On the other hand we will deal friendly in our world affairs regarding the interests of the people and obviate every false traditions so that the souls may rest and the hearts may join and unite together and subdue the enemy. As regards the matter of Ateiba with their cousins &lt; * I have followed them and gave them the choice of one of ) -• &gt; ? four things,viz: either to come to anyone of the Ulema they like in Nejd and listen to what he may judge of and carry out same in my guarantee or that they may bring their antagonists and accept making peace between them by own me and I will lost of my/wealth. The other two points are: He who pretends that he is in the Sherif's service t and under his order, he should receive his right if unlaw- - fully taken from him and if the man is on r the borders of ♦ the Sherif, then it is a matter between the Sherif and us to deal with. But he who travels over Nejd should avert himself and if it happened that he is transgressed he will be lawfully treated by this religious law. You know that we never judge (either for ourselves or our subjects) except according the orders of God and His Prophet. Besides * this, I previously suggested making one of three things, viz: the first is that you may not give heed to anything you may hear either from afar or.near because you will understand that.the good or contrary are the same to an Arab or otherwise. The second: you will really know that I am not covetous of anything under your rule - neither ‘ : * V' « ‘“'S ^ ! J IT country nor people and you are the same. The third is that the case between us is unknown. For I see something good^of yo^if 1 ever^o^wrl^l me s a i^te^ c :^ e ^o 3 d e 9 ftif* findthat what has been sent to me and also it is the same as your letter which you wrote to Ibn Meammar that he should warn the people of Qasira afid those of Washm. This is contradictory to wisdom and religion. If there is any anger, discussion of consultation this is between you and myself. The people neither big nor small has nothing to do with it. If there is an intention that I -should be harmed, the subjects should not be at all touched with any harm. The ruler has to defend his subjects. The people of Nejd are weak and are in the hands of God and under my order. They cannot do anything for themselves or arrange for their matters without these means. The crime you have imputed to them is impossible and of no grounds. I never say that the people of Nejd do not like to proceed and spend their money in every town, but they are afraid of us and we are obliged to prevent them owing to our interests from two points of view, ihe first is that these people whom you say are assisting the Turks or Ibn Rachid are enemies to us our fathers and grandfathers before they became enemies with the British oi’ you. Prom this point of view we never accept to assist them or make any good for them, the fact which every body either wise or otherwise know quite well and nobody ever thinks that we may do the contrary. The second is that we are in agreement with Great Britain, how is it then that we can accept to do contrarily. You should look carefully in the matters referring to our interests and those of our subjects and put the things in their proper places, I trust that you, God willing, will understand every thing. Indeed I have written too much and lengthened the letter, but I am obliged to do this owing to the necessity for same. You will, God willing, realise, believe and be sure that we are of and for you against your enemies unless you may oblige us to do what we could not do without. This is forwardedforwarded for your information and may God preserve you. Emir of Nejd el Alisa el Qateef and the Head of their Tribes Abd el Aziz Ibn Abd el Rahman el Sapud. Sealed . ■ r dated Ragab 1336. r • • J Translation is poor in places. Hot e .Xotes by Colonel Hamilton, Political Agent, Koweit, based on conversations at Riyadli in November 1917. (Received through Arab Bureau, Iraq Section.) I. IbN Sa’ud’s TITT.E. I bn Sa nd is frequently referred to by us as Tlis Excellency or His Honom the Amir of Naid (or of Central Arabia). In Ids own dominions 1m is spoken ol by respectful persons as the Imam, while the Beduin call him familiaily Abdul Aziz or Itukkam (plural of Hakkim). In Riyadh there is a chance of being misunderstood in calling him Imam, as that is also the title of his father Abdur Rahaman. Ibn Sa’ud does not like to be called the Amir, as that is the courtesy title commonly given to headmen of towns and villages. He prefers to be addressed officially as a vim Najd. It would, therefore, seem that the best official title would be Ihs Excellency the Rider (11adhr-at-al-IIa.him) of Xajd. Ibn Sa’ud’ is quite ho II. Relations with the Tribes (’Ajman, &amp;c.). attitude towards the ’Ajman has undergone no change. He considers it is quite hopeless to arrange any terms with them, as they are horn and sworn enemies of his, and are notorious even among Arabs for treachery and disregard or all contracts. They do not obey their Shaikhs, and frequently set at nought tribal customs of fundamental importance. Moreover, the ’Ajman have not, abided by the terms imposed upon them by the Government with Bm ba ud s consent and approval, as drawn up at Kuwait in November 191(i. As soon as bn ...a ud began . o oather the clans for his march upon Ibn Rashid, the A]man under all the Sian is of the Ilm Ilithlain went off to Ibn Rashid, and, taking station upon his flank, immobilised a large proportion of his .force, and contributed to the general failure of his intended offensive. They have only come m now because they are haul up for provisions. Ibn Sa'ud considers, and nothing will convince him of the contrary thaf Ibn Sabbali’s (Salim of Kuwait) allowing them to enter his terntoues is a distinctly unfriendly act, and is so understood by all Arabs. His dilterences wit ibfsTlHi are entirely on account of the ’Ajman.- Even his. taxation of the Awazim (who'he savs, with afl the desert tribes really belong to us confederation) is, he hints’, his reply to Ibn Sabbah’s unfriendly conduct in harbcmniig - ’ Vi man He greatly dislikes Salim personally, m spite oi the fact that Sai in s so stiict’a * Mosfim so 'severe a bur,tan, that he is as Wahabi as any man jack of the Najdis. ' Salim’ is close-fisted, he says ; but another reason, 1 8«*pecb « the mutual iealousv felt in this instance to a greater extent by balun than Ibn ba ud. nst w \ the latter complains that we have shown in Ins regarc 0001 a the Sharif, so Salim asks me why we subsidise Ibn ba U&lt;1 P ' | month, implying, though of course not saying, that we do nothing for him. I argued the case in favour of the ’Aj, nan at several lo1 !? '’^’ATmln - to move Ibn Sa’ud to relent beyond offering the following ^ _i Iternative (1).—That-'the tribe should move off at once tn masse to assist IP Hadhdhal and the Northern ’Anizah. ^ . q u Alternative (2) —That several of the principal Shaikhs should come into Riyad i and sm'render and leave hostages for their future good behaviour ; the tribe might then move to Qasim to the ’Ataibah dirah and remain quiet. A S 15 40 IS'&gt; On no account will 11m Sa’ud hear of tl.mr -ep^.aUon m Ha a J ^ne that would render his rear and connnumcations ' \ the capital. he would be unable to tndeCards .his tribe. 1 From old There is nn.ch to be said fot bn ^a ini s anm. d Rnd his forbears times the ’Ajman have been is je a. 11 ‘ but they liave proved incapable o£ have been compelled to m bet severe ffor P w hom there is no reform, remaining natural lel.els. . acknowledged universally that the -remedy but to be placed outside the X' „^ ready enough to follow ’Ajman do not obey then . mi 18 11 ; . best friends and blood connections, them and obey them }**f ; c ‘.f t ”\X V 'mreltVo and notorious brigands even such as the Ibn Sabbali, adn &gt; a ■, i ( j perceived the necessity for a among Arabs. 1 hoped last ci^e.mnent and that they would have policy of friend icVn'tlK'°t!i'act allotted to them between Kuwait and Zubair.

There'may be something in this latter statement as a t le t 1, frnade a dash for the splendid spring pasturage winch was obtainable between 0 ,sim and Jabafsitannnar this year, that to the north being of proportionately poor inlilv My conversations with Ibn Sahid, however, have convinced me that it ,1 •' ii’. rebitions are to he restored between him and Kuwait, or even il he is to iriendly ichations a b e moved off from their present Snlwa^ m-mnZica^s between Qasim and Kuwait. And I have come U,Tl e conclusion that unless we comply by, if necessary, bnnguig pressure to near on the Shaikh of Kuwait to evict the tribe or by accepting their submission ourselves olt conditions above mentioned, we cannot expect greater act.v, y on the part of Ibn Sa’ud much less that he should throw himself heart and soul into the task of usbing Ibn Rashid, and thereafter perhaps joining forces with the Sharif to make a 'm s veep of the Turks out of Arabia and Southern Syria. It must bo remembered tan bwtva • the great confederation of tribes that Ibn Sa’ud lias great difficulty m managing w bhi’acknouiedge hir rebg^is and secuhu; leadership. According to . Inm tliey consist of Mutair ’Awazim, Bam Hajaf, Manasir, Ajman, l^eni lihalid, bani Ahdal a i, Qiditan° Dmvasir, Subai’, Sahul, ’Anizab, ’Ataibah and Harb. That is to say, nractically all the tribes of Central and North Arabia. Over some o these Ins dominion'is somewhat shadowy no doubt, and, as regards the Harb at least, is m is e with the Sharif. However, Ilu, Sa’ud might easily carry all these tribes vhb him for a grand movement if he himself came up to the scratch amt were provided with the money to finance such an enterprise. Garrisons would have to be eft behind in Hasa, Riyadh, and the provincial towns and arrangements made for he maintenance of order among the tribes during the absence of the mam expedition : a task this of great magnitude, but one for which, fortunately, Ibn Sa ud could find trustworthy wardens from among various loyal and competent members of Ins own If therefore it is desired that, Ibn Sa’ud should undertake a movement on a considerable scale, we must arrange to side-track the ’Ajman or to draw their teeth in some effective manner. It would be well, then, to summon the headmen the tube into Basrah or Kuwait to hear the decision of Government and to make their cuoice between submission to Ibn Sa’ud in accordance with the terms stated above, or to quit the territories of all tribes friendly to Goverimient. Having discussed the question of submission to Ibn Sa ud with Dhaidan himself, and learnt^i'rom his lips that the tribe would prefer to wander for ever in strange dirahs rather than to return under Ibn Sa’ud, 1 have little hope that he is likely to prove compliant; and he will probably take the tribe with him for the present into the Shammar dirah. Ibn Sa’ud says that the ’Ajman sections m rebellion could not possibly muster more than 1.500 fighting men, that if Ibn Sabbah or Zubair have not the force to evict them, lie will undertake the job. Ibn Sa ud knows that there is a likelihood that we shall take him at his word in this instance and is prepared to move upon a signal from us. My opinion is that the Ajman, who have giown weakei as a result &amp; of their wanderings, will cave in to Ibn Sa’ud, unless the Shammar give them asylum or we take responsibility for them again at Zubair or elsewhere.Question of Capture of Hail. tWMMnwiWMiNUK. Ibn Sa’ud says that is a very big matter. He and his forbears have been lighting for the past 40 years with this object in view, the net result being nil after ^ alternations of partial successes with severe disasters. Never have they been within sight of the concpiest of Hail and the Shammar. The strength of this tribe lies in several factors which-it is important to remember. To begin with, they are a single united tribe ; secondly, Ibn Rashid is himself a Shammar Shaikh ; thirdly, Hail can always count upon- the support of the Turkish Government, assistance 'which is always close at hand. Ibn Rashid has received much encouragement from the Turks during tlie war, and much money and arms and even soldiers to garrison Hail. As long as the Turks hold Medinah and the railway, Ibn Rashid’s position must always be strong. He has lately been with Fakl^t) Pasha in Medinah and has probably received fresh subsidies. Added to all this, the Shammar are stiff fighters and are always ready to take on superior numbers of mixed Najd clans. They are redoubtable antagonists, and if in full force, as they might be were any serious attempt made upon Hail, it is very doubtful if any combination of tribes could defeat them, at least on or near Jabal Shammar. And failing a coup &lt;lc main, there would probably ensue a desultory siege of town and hills. The Turks might render relief, and in any case, unsupported by regular troops, it is sure that a loosely held-together Peduin confederation would soon tire of the job and break up. Ibn Sa’ud thinks that the economic lever applied by means of a strict blockade would be the most effectual means of bringing the Shammar over. This, however, he • realises, with the Aslam and other sections being exempt themselves and engaged all the time in blockade running, is scarcely practicable. If we treated all the Shammar as a corporate body, and refused to have any further relations with Ibn Tuwalah and other sections now posing as friendly until the whole tribe submitted, there is not the slightest doubt that the Shammar would be isolated to such an extent that they would have no alternative to surrender. The screw must, similarly, be put on the ’Anizah, i.c., they must be treated not by sections but as a corporate whole. Ibn Sa’ud suggests that a larger share in the control of Central Arabian traffic should be in his hands; that he should have agents at each of the chief market towns under British occupation or suzerainty ; and that these agents should be consulted before any export passes are granted, IV. Attitude towards King Husain. Ibn Sa’ud is consumed with jealousy of Sharif Husain, King of the Hijuz, and this jealousy has lately Teen fanned to a white heat by the latter’s assumption of the title of King of Arabia (Malak al diyar, or, bilad al Arab;. Ihe Sharif has been receiving large subsidies from us, and has gathered round him not only all tne clans of the Hijaz and neighbouring districts, but has also drawn to his side all the ’Ataibah and Harb, tribes -which Ibn Sa’ud claims as belonging to him. Latterly large numbers of ’Acjad or Najd townsmen attracted by high pay have levanted to the Sharif from ’Anaizah, Buraidah, Sharah, and Midhnib. These ’Aqail. represent some of the best fighting stock in the country. 1 he Amirs of Anaizah and Midhnib assured me that no less than 4,000 of them had joined the Shaiifs loices fiom Qasim alone, and these do not include Beduin. In the course of conversation Ibn Sa’ud has frecpiently appealed loi equality^ o treatment with the Sharif. He hints that we have left him m the_ cold while doing everything for his rival. He complains that we have not given him due credit for his espousal of our cause and uncompromising hostility towards the lurks: he even claims credit for the fact that, but for his benevolent attitude tow aid tbe Shan I and his holding the Shammar in check, the former’s rebellion would have had no chance of success. He said that he had resisted many tempting offers from the Links who. wen, always attempting to reopen negotiations with him. As proof of this lattei stateanent he showed me a letter from Fakhri Pasha, Commandant at Medinah, asking him why he had not replied to his friendly Letter of the year previous. I saw also the letter referred to. Both appeared to be quite genuine. If he has been carrying on any intrigue it has been with Fakhri Pasha’s superiors at Damascus or elsewhere. It is rumoured and universally believed that he has received subsidies from the lurks, A 2 S 15find while marching through Woshm I was told hat a party of nine .mhs. German officers had just cleared out of Riyadh and passed me neai ^ » the opposite direction. This 1 hardly think likely ; m fact, it is aery ■&lt; though some of Ihn Sa’ud’s entourage are pro-1 uii, or a, &lt;ui\ o &lt; . ■ , policy of hedging against a possible return ot the Ottoman Government It is not an uncommon occurrence, as we have found m Mesopotamia also, that wheie theie aie two rival Shaikhs or sections, and one is for us, the other turns pro-link. In the case of Ibn Sa'ml and the Sharif we have befriended both, though natuially doing most for the Sharif who has rendered such great services to the cause ibn Sa ud, however thinks we should treat both equally. His mind harps on the ques ion of the pos Ullum conditions and oscillates distressfully between the disadvantages that will accrue to him according as the war should result in the victory of the Allies or the Central Powers. We have sometimes thought that his possession ot iiasa, which is of such great importance to his Emirate, from which he expelled the Piirks a short time before the war, would be an overwhelming argument m our favour : that he could only hope to keep it by holding on to our skirts. Put such, 1 am reliaWy informed, is not really the case. Whichever side should wm, he does not believe he will he allowed to hold on to Hasa for long, m view of the well-known cupidity and acquisitiveness of great Powers. What is certain is that, should the Allies win and tpg Turks be driven out of Aralha, he will have the mortification of linding bis n\al the Sharif firmly established as an influential and powerful monarch able to count on the support of Great Britain and the Mahommedan world, while he (Ibn Sa’ud) remains a mere Beduin chieftain—as he was before the war—but with the Shammar and Northern ’Anizali irretrievably lost and the Sharif claiming overlordship over the border tribes. If, on the other hand, the Central Powers conquer, as he thinks they will, he will have the satisfaction of seeing King Husain go down, while as regards his own position he relies on his political acumen to drive some sort of bargain with the Turks. This does not mean that Ibn Sa’ud is pro-Turk. He hates the 1 urk as his ancestors did and he likes and admires the British, infidels though they are. But it is a matter of policy, and when policy is concerned he must regard the matter entirely from the point of view of self-interest, v.e., the interests of his dynasty and the Wahabi faith. He will not he induced to take any action unless the object is justified primarily in these interests ; in other words he has got it into his head that he is not going to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for us or for anyone. This is perhaps the reason that Ibn Sa’ud has not attempted seriously to take Hail or performed any noteworthy feat during the war. He hopes that, when our subsidies cease, the tribes now supporting the Sharif will return to their former allegiance. He says that the Sharif is already on bad terms with some of the Harb and told me one day with manifest elation that the Baqhah section of the ’Ataibahhad been converted in a body to the “ Ikhwan,” a religions brotherhocd which Ibn Sa’ud is fostering to the utmost of his ability. If the view of Ibn Sa’ud’s policy which 1 have endeavoured to set down is correct, it can he seen how foolish it would be to expect any thorough going co-operation from him even if more liberally subsidised. Indeed it is quite probable that any additional subsidies we may give him would be used to buy back Harb and ’Ataibah Chiefs who are now with the Sharif. The only means f can think of that would induce him to undertake a big movement on our behalf would be to give him assurances regarding his future boundaries, both territorial and tribal, and to satisfy him as to his personal status as a Prince vis-a-vis the King of the Hijaz ; after which the sinews of war, mbneE and arms, would have to bo given with a liberal hand. What could he then give as his part of the bargain? From my observation of the esteem in which ‘ Abdul ’Aziz is held in Central and South Central Arabia, I believe that he could, if he chose to put his heart into it, raise the whole country. V. . Ibn Sa’ud’s Desiderata. The following conditions would completely satisfy Ibn Sa’ud :— (1.) That we should observe towards him the same policy of trust and confidence as we pursue in the case of the Sharif. (2.) Treating him on an equality with the Sharif, we should acknowledge his hegemony in Najd, Central Arabia and its dependencies and, as we have conceded thestyle and title of His Highness King of the Hijaz to the latter, we should proclaim him as His Highness the Hakim (or Ruler) of Najd. 1 4 1 . (3 That all tribal allowances made by us to the tribes o± Central Arabia, including the ’Anizah and ’Ataibah, Mutair, Subai, Bani Hajar, Qahtan, Dawasir, Manasir^Ahl Murrah, B. Abdallah, Sahul, ’Ajman, Shammar, and Dhafir should be paid through Ibn Sa’ud and the Britisli Resident accredited to him. (4.) That the British Government should be permanently represented by a Political Resident. i i a i ( 5 .) That the control of the caravan traffic of the interior from Karbala, bamawan, Khamisiyah, Zubair, Kuwait, Qatr and other markets should be delegated to Ibn Sa ud and his British Resident, the former keeping agents at each of these markets. ( 6 .) That subsidies should be granted him, with war material, the loan of engineers and instructors, in proportion to the magnitude of operations expected of him or of the armed forces he is required to keep up. &lt; ( 7 .) That we should assist him to re-establish trade in the ports of nasa by arranging for a regular steamship service with India. (8 ) That the terms of an agreement on these lines be reduced m a formal document or Treaty similar to the existing Treaty. In this Treaty the position of ’Abdul’ Aziz Ibn Sa’ud would be defined and the succession of heirs of his body would be guaranteed. On his part Ibn Sa’ud would agree to act in subordinate co-operation with us in an offensive and defensive alliance, engaging specifically not to enter into anv sort of relation with any other Power but the British, or with any Arab Chief or nation, whether under our protection or under the protection of another tribe. —This is the maximum, and a much modified arrangement on these lines would be acceptable.p Register No. ' ./ , 7 'X , ‘ l^^SUr / f 3 Minute Paper.

Note prepared hy Arab Bureau, Irak Section. ]. ’Abdul Aziz Ibn Sa’ud, the present Hakim of Najd, may be said to have begun his reign in 1901, when he was proclaimed Governor of Riyadh by his father, ’Abdul Rahman. The Sa’ud family were at that time in exile, having been driven out of their dominions in 1891 by their hereditary foe, Ibn Rashid. In 1902, ’Abdul ’Aziz, with the help of Mubarak Ibn Sabah, Shaikh of Kuwait, recovered Riyadh in a daring raid which he led in person, and by 1906 he had so far re-established the old supremacy of the Sa’ud as to carry hostilities to the gates of Hail. During the years succeeding his return to Riyadh he acted in close alliance with the Shaikh desiring in the curtailing of Rashit of Kuwait, who had every reason for influence. For the Rashid were allies and, in a remote acceptation of the term, vassals of the Ottoman Empire, subsidised and backed by Constanti nople, and they represented in Arabia the Turkish policy of centralisation which the Shaikh was covertly resisting in his own territories. His geographical position on the shores of the Persian Gulf had placed him in relations with the British Government; since 1899 we had had a friendly understanding with him, and had promised to support him against Ottoman aggression. But the existence of this connection made us unwilling to see him drawn into the confused and uncertain feuds of the interior; and acting on the principle laid down in 1897 that we were “ not disposed to interfere more than was necessary for the maintenance “ of general peace in the Persian Gulf,” We had discouraged him from embroiling himself in Central Arabian affairs. • Ibn Sa’ud, in spite of his growing importance, was outside the limits of our interest, thus appointed, aud it was not until 1911 that special attention was drawn to him in our official reports. In that year Captain Shakespear, the Political Agent at Kuwait, while on tour, met him by chance in the desert and was hospitably entertained m his camp. Ibn Sa ud expressed to him a desire to be received into a recognised relationship with Great Britain ; he referred to Colonel Pelly’s visit to Riyadh in 1865, and to the overtures made to us by his father, ’Abdul Rahman, in 190-1, when a British Agent was first appointed to Kuwait. 1 le spoke in strong terms of the hatred which the Arabs entertained for the Turks and of his own resentment of their occupation of the Hasa, a province which he was particularly anxious to regain, not only because it formed part of his ancestral dominions, but also because it would give him access to the sea and control over the tribes from Riyadh to the coast. He regarded with grave apprehension the aggressive policy of the new regime iihTurkey, and would welcome, if he recovered the Hasa, a British Agent in one of his ports ; and he added that our trade would benefit fromjhe increased securitv which, he would maintain on the caiavan loutes. Captain ShakeSpear could make no other rejoinder than that the Biitish Government confined its interests to the coast, and had never challenged Turkish claims to the ordering of affairs in Central Arabia, with which we had no concern , that we were, moreover, on amicable terms with -Turkey and should be averse from anything in the nature of intrigue against the Ottoman Govern ment ; but in his comments on the report of this interview, Sir Percy Cox pointed out that as the Porte seemed disposed to be intractable in the adjustment of matters relating to British interests in the Gulf, we could not afford to ignore Ibn Sand’s attitude. His personal authority had greatly increased and it would be well to entertain cordial if distant relations with him. The Foreign Office, however, decided that it was impossible at that time to swerve from our policy of strict non-interference. 2 Two years later Ibn Sa’ud, without the assistance which he had tried to obtain from us, though he was credited throughout Arabia with having si :io 2/18 A .1 l 11 ; ummm 9 secured it, overran the Hasa, ejected without difficulty the small Turkisli garrisons and established himself on the coast at Qatif and Ojair. Captain Shakespear, on his return to England in June 1914 from a long projected journey across Arabia, in the course of which he had visited Riyadh, bore witness to the strong personal domination which Ibn Sa’ud’s vigorous and commanding personality had established, and from other reports it was clear that he was regarded beyond liis own frontiers as the coming man. He proved more than a match for the ineffective efforts of the Turks to retake the Hasa : they resorted to diplomacy and opened negotiations with him through Saiyid Talib of Basrah. Early in May Tal’at Beg had formulated in private conversation at the British Embassy the expectations of the Ottoman Government in terms which seemed to his hearers little consonant with actual conditions. He proposed to establish a strictly delimited frontier between Ibn Sa’ud and Ibn Rashid, place representatives of the Sultan at Riyadh and at Hail, and rely upon the guile of these officials to control without the aid of force the actions of the two Amirs. As for the Hasa, Ibn Sa’ud would be appointed Mutasarrif of the province, but the collection of the Customs would remain in Turkish hands and Turkish garrisons would be replaced in the ports. 3. Nothing was more certain than that Ibn Sa’ud’s appearance on the coast must ultimately bring him into direct contact with ourselves, whether we welcomed it or sought to avoid it ; and this anxiety underlay and possibly accelerated the action of the Porte. But at the moment Turkish fears were groundless. We were concerned wholly with the conclusion of prolonged negotiations with Constantinople, touching interests in Mesopotamia and the Gulf which were of vital importance, and were less inclined, if possible, than before for Arabian adventure. We made a friendly offer of mediation which was refused, and when in April 1914 the Amir met the British Agent, Colonel Grey, outside Kuwait, lie was given to understand that we had recently concluded a comprehensive agreement with Turkey and could hold out to him no hope of support. Ibn Sa’ud was thrown back on his own resources, but these were considerable, and the secret treaty which was signed in May by himself and the Wall of Basrah fell short of Tal’at Beg’s anticipations. He accepted the title of Wall and Military Commandant of Najd which was offered to himself and his descendants as long as they should remain loyal, and engaged to fly the Turkish flag, but he was to have charge of the Customs on behalf of the Ottoman Government, raise his own levies and provide the garrisons for Qatif and Ojair. Deficiencies in the Najd budget were to be met from the Customs, and no revenue from any local income was to be paid to Constantinople until such time aS there was a surplus, an eventuality of doubtful occurrence. But while exercising in his own terfitories an authority which was in all but the name that of an inde pendent ruler, his correspondence with foreign Powers was to be conducted solely through the Porte, and in case of war he was to come to the assistance of the Sultan. 4. What would have been the upshot of a treaty which so imperfectly reflected the convictions of the contracting parties can scarcely, admit of doubt. The guiding trait of Ibn Sa’ud’s character is what must’be called a lacial rather than a national patriotism, but this sentiment was not likely to evoke sympathetic consideration from the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, who were blindly determined on the Ottomanization of the Arabs. As a strict Wahabi, the new Wali of Najd looked with abhorrence on the loose religious principles of the Turks and was far from admitting -their pretensions to represent and direct Islam. He had, in conversation with Captain Shakespear, spoken with unexpected vehemence on this point, saying that in his eyes the Infidel was preferable to the Turk, since the latter broke the rule he professed to follow while the former acted in accordance with his own law : and to the same listener he declared that he had accepted the terms of the agreement only because he was assured privately that even the small measure of sovereignty accorded to Turkey would never be claimed. The Kuwait treaty was put to the test bv the outbreak of European war and found wanting.o 5 . r rire disquieting attitude adopted by Turkey on the outbreak of war between Xdermany and the Entente Powers produced a profound alteration in our policy towards the Porte. It became necessary to reckon up our assets in Arabia, and early in October Captain Shakespear, who was in England, was ordered to return to the Persian Gulf and get into touch with Ibn Sa’ud, so as to prevent, if possible, the outbreak of unrest in the interior, and in the event of war with Turkey to ensure that no assistance should be rendered from that quarter. Before he could reach his destination war had been declared. A message had been despatched to Ibn Sa’ud informing him of Captain Shakespear’s impending visit, recognising his position in .Najd and the Hasa and guaranteeing him against reprisals by sea or land if he would commit himself to enter the lists against Turkey. The Turks, on their side, lost no time in approaching the Amirs of Central Arabia. Their scheme, which was that Ibn Rashid should aid in the campaign against Egypt while Ibn Sa’ud opposed the British advance in Mesopotamia, showed that they were as unaware of the feeling toward them which prevailed among the Arabs as they were ignorant of the conditions of the desert, where the network of tiibal feud permits no man to withdraw his forces on a distant expedition without fear of attack on his unprotected possessions. Ibn Sa’ud, apparently in order to gain time, took advantage of his abiding enmity with Ibn Rashid and launched into open hostilities against him. In vain Enver Pasha urged him to abandon private quarrels, sent ^him a gift of money for the expenses of co-operation with the Sultan’s armies, and ultimately entrusted Saiyid Talib with the task of bringing about a reconciliation. At this juncture Saiyid Talib was busily engaged in endeavouring, through the intermediation of Shaikh Khaz’al and His Majesty’s Consul at Muhammarah, to drive a bargain with the British Government providing for his adherence to us in the event of war with Turkey, but the terms which he put forward were so extravagant as to be impossible of acceptance, and he was still hesitating over Shaikh Khaz’al’s advice to him to abate them when the declaration of war left him stranded. Then it was that he saw in his proposed deputation to Najd a providential means of escape from Basrah, where his position had now become highly precarious, and he left hurriedly for Ibn Sand’s camp, via Zubair. Mean while the Wahabi Chief, in response to Turkish exhortation, had pleaded that he could spare no troops for the ’Iraq till he had reduced Ibn Rashid to his rightful state of vassalage. To the British message he replied that he was unshaken in his long-standing desire for intimate relations with us. But he was not unnaturally reluctant to take open part with us until he was satisfied that our change of front towards himself was likely to be permanent, and m spite of his personal confidence m Captain Shakespeai it was with some misgiving that he consented to his visit. The meeting took place on •31st December at Ehufsah, near Majma , in Sudair. Ibn ba ud spoke with great frankness. Before compromising himself wholly with the Turks he asked that our assurances of support should be embodied in a foimal tieaty, the terms of which were drafted forthwith. They included a guarantee of complete independence on our part and an undeitaking on the part of Ibn Sa’ud that he would have no dealings with other Poweis except after reference to the British Government. He informed Captain Shakespear that he had been in communication with the Sharif and with the heads of the northern ’Anazah confederation, and that they were resolved to stand together. He was holding in detention a party of four envoys sent by the Turks to urge him to join Ibn Rashid in a Jinad against us, but aftei consultation with Captain Shakespear the Turkish mission was dismissed with the reply that Ibn Rashid’s forces were camped within two days ol Ibn Sa’ud and that there could now be no question of peace between them. On 17th January a messenger arrived from Mecca bearing a letter from tne ■ Sharif’s son ’Abdullah, who wrote that the Sharif had been called upon to proclaim the Jihad and was temporising till he heard what line Ibn Sa ud proposed to take. Ibn Sa’ud made answer that he saw no advantage to the Arabs in joining the Ottoman Government and had himself dismissed a Turkish deputation empty-handed. G. Upon the reports sent by Captain Shakespear from Ibn Sa ud s camp, Sir Percy Cox was authorised to proceed with the negotiations for the tieaty.4 4&gt;ut on -lt.li January battle was joined between Ibn band and Ibn KasLid, and Cap.tain Shakespear, unanned and present only as a spectator, met Ins death. Ibn Sa nd’s version of the disaster was that he was shot dead by a Shammar rifle-bullet, but this statement is in any case based only on second hand information, as it is undisputed that Captain Shakespear had taken up a position in a different part of the field from that where his host was located. Since then various and divergent accounts of what happened have been recited, one of little more value than another, but the balance of; evidence goes to show that he was first wounded in the leg and disabled, and soon afterwards killed m the charge of Ibn Rashid s cavalry, which, overwhelmed the'flank on which he was posted. In the souve qui peat which ensued it is feared that he was either abandoned or forgotten, but the precise circumstances of his untimely death will probably never be ascertained. Ibn Sa’ud expressed profound regret for the loss of one whom he regarded as a brother, and always refers to him with respect and affection. 7. The action was indecisive : both parties claimed the victory, and both were temporarily crippled and forced to retire. It was an unexpected and a somewhat disconcerting result, for Ibn Sa’ud's preparations had been made on an exceptional scale and his forces were said largely to outnumber those of Ibn.Rashid, though he was inferior in cavalry.. The accounts given by the Arabs attribute his defeat to the treachery of the ’Ajman. Ibn Sa’ud’s personal courage is beyond question, but he not uncommonly falls short as a tactician, and Mubarak of Kuwait pronounced him to be a poor leader in battle. But if he had not dealt Ibn Rashid a crushing blow he had at least put him out of action and prevented him from joining the Turks, as he unquestionably would have done. The intervention of Ibn Rashid in the early part of the Mesopotamian campaign might have added considerably to our difficulties. Nevertheless, Captain Shakespear’s death was a heavy price to pay for the advantage of immobilising him. 8 . The two Chiefs held apart without further hostilities till the summer, when an agreement dated 10 th June was concluded between them. Ibn Rashid recognised Ibn Sa’ud’s claims, except that of overlordship, which he could scarcely be expected to acknowledge, and undertook not to play a treacherous game towards the Turkish Government, but to incline towards whichever Government was in alliance with Ibn Sa’ud. He confined his own jurisdiction to Hail and its villages and the Sham mar tribes, while Ibn Sa’ud was acknowledged to hold all Najd from Al Khahaf to Dawasir. A1 Khahaf is no doubt the Kahafah of Hunter’s map, a little north of latitude 27°. In a tribal country the adjustment of frontiers can never be very exact, but it is clear that Ibn Rashid renounced all pretensions to the Qasim, a province whose rich oases had frequently changed hands. It is of interest to note that the tribes reckoned as subject to Ibn Sa’ud are the Mutair, ’Ataibah, Harb, Bani ’Abdullah, ’Ajman, Murrah, Manasir, Bani Hajar, Subai’, Sahul, Qantan and Dawasir ; but this catalogue must not be taken as exact, for the Mutair are mostly in Kuwait territory, .and the ’Ataiban and Harb come for the greater part under the Sharif. 9. After Captain Shakespear’s death Ibn Sa’ud sent an immediate request that another officer should be accredited to him, or, failing this, that negotiations should continue through his agent in Basrah, ’Abdul’ Latif Mandd. No suitable officer was available, but Ibn Sa’ud was advised to sign a preliminary agreement on the lines of Captain Shakespear’s draft and leave all details to be settled later. He signed and returned the new draft which had been sent to him, but with some important modifications, con cerning vdiich it seemed better to postpone further discussion till a meeting with the Chief Political Officer could be arranged. For the time, therefore, the conclusion of the treaty vxas suspended, Ibn Sa’ud being wholly engaged with internal affairs. His position at home at this epoch was the reverse of secure. His reputation among the tribes had suffered from the unsuccessful operations against Ibn Rashid, during vddeh he had incurred much loss in material and equipments, and during the greater part of 1915 he was engaged with a dangerous rising in the Hasa on the part'of the ’Ajman.5 He himself believed that the revolt was instigated by the Turks and Ibn Rashid, but- it is doubtful whether his view was correct. Mubarak of Kuwait was convinced that there was no evidence to support it, but Mubarak, during the last few years of his reign, was not a lenient critic of Ibn Sa’ud’s difficulties. 10. His opinion is so far borne out that the troubles with the ’Ajman seem to have begun with the occupation of the Hasa by the Amir in 1913. Up to that time the tribe had been on good terms with him and had generally recognised him as suzerain, but the extension of his direct authority to the Hasa, which is their headquarters, had strained their allegiance. He attempted to impose a poll tax upon them and stopped them from taking- dues from caravans passing through the country, a toll which they had been accustomed to exact in the days of the Turks. The discontent of the ’Aiman was fanned by members of Ibn Sa’ud’s family who had long been at enmity with him—the ’Araif, grandsons of his uncle Sa’ud. Two of the ’Araif cousins, Fahad Ibn Sa’ud and Salman Ibn Muhammad, had taken refuge with the Shaikh of Bahrein. The Shaikh made a half-hearted attempt to patch up a reconciliation in 1914, but the ’Araif refused his mediation and sought the protection of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, from whom they received some countenance when hostilities were renewed with Ibn Sa’ud in 1915. The rebellion now assumed serious proportions. Ibn Sa’ud sent for more troops from Riyadh and asked help from Kuwait, but before the arrival of either reinforcement he attacked the’Ajman by night neai Hofufandmet with a reverse, due partly to the cowardice of the Hofuf town levies. His brother Sa’ud was killed and he himself wounded. For a time his fortunes were at a very low ebb. He was in want of money and arms, and for all practical purposes was besieged in Hofuf. Ibn Rashid, oblivious^ of the agreement recently signed, seized the opportunity to raid the Qasim, but his advance was easily stopped, and the arrival of a force from Kuwait under the Shaikh’s son, Salim, turned the balance an the Hasa. I he Ajman were routed in September, harried on their retreat northwards by the 1 am Khalid, and forced to take refuge in Kuwait territory where they remained until Shaikh Mubarak’s death in December. lahad Ibn Sa nd was killed in the retreat: Salman made his peace with Ibn Sa’ud at the end of the year. During the struggle we had facilitated the despatch of ammunition to Ibn Sa’ud from Bahrein, and done what we could to restrain Abu Dhabi. In October we presented Ibn Sa’ud with 1,000 rifles, and gave him a loan of 20 0001. The Turks had not yet abandoned all hope of winning him over and in July, previous to Ibn Rashid’s raid, a Turkish emissary, Salih al Sharif al Hasni, communicated with him and proposed a meeting , mi his request was refused, and on 26th December Ibn Sand met Sir . eicy Cox at Qatif, and the long-delayed treaty was completed and signed. Subject to certain safeguards, it provided Ibn Sa ud with a dynastic guarantee in the dominions now in his possession, and promised him the support of Great Britain in case of unprovoked aggression from foreign Powers On his side, Ibn Sa’ud engaged to hold no correspondence with anv foreign Power, and to grant no concessions to foreigners ; to keep open the roads to the Holy Places, and to commit no aggressive act on othei Shaikhs under our protection. 11 Ibn Sa’ud was unaware of the exceedingly confidential correspondence which we had been carrying on with the Sharif during the winter of 1915 16 but the results to which it led could not leave him indifferent. Relation between the Hijaz and Najd had been dictated by conflicting sentiments. The Sharif had even more reason than Ibn Sa’ud to fear the luiks, but e was jealous of Ibn Sa’ud’s position as an Arab Chiei, ami ^^”8 rppinrocated in Riyadh. The fluctuating allegiance of the tubes is a ncli source, of discord' in Arabia, and the absence of any jUgKq enhances the uncertainty of .claims and “q^^-Q^Gn Gote r ninent ’AVhdlah asserting that he acted on behalf of the Ottoman Vroveinme i, Trched to the borders of the Qasim for the purpose of reasserting an aifthorlty which was pinbably a thing of the past and must at the best have been shadowy. The tangible results of the raid do not seem to have been si Bmore than a re-insistence on the Sharif’s suzerainty over the distant sections of the ’Ataibah, a tribe which had once been under Ibn Sa’ud, but had largely seceded to the Sharif. A small tribute to Mecca from the Qasim villages was stipulated for by Abdullah before his withdrawal, but it is unlikely that it was ever paid. From 1913 the Sharif showed stiong anti-luikish pro clivities, and before the outbreak of war he and Ibn Sa’ud drew together. They were in correspondence when Captain Shakespear paid his first visit to Riyadh in the spring of 1914. In January 1915 they were acting in concert, and Ibn Sa’ud told Captain Shakespear that in his view the Khalifate Would revert to the family of the Prophet, of which the Sharif was the representa tive, if it dropped from the hand of the Sultan of lurkev. in November 1915 ’Abdullah reappeared in Najd, with what object is not very clear. His own explanation was that he was sent on a mission to Ibn Sa’ud, with the further purpose of collecting dues m the Qasim and Sudair. Except for a doubtful suzerainty over wandering sections of the ’Ataibah, the Sharif does not seem in Beduin estimation to have rights in either province, his limits eastwards being somewhere between Long. 44 and Long. 45 , at Sha arah, Duwadmi, Jabal Dhurai and Jabal alNir. ’Abdullah is not reported to have advanced much beyond Sha’arah; he collected dues from the ’Ataibah, subdued the small allied section of the Buraih (by origin Mutair) and returned to the Hijaz ; but Ibn Sa’ud, barely emerged from a perilous contest in the Ilasa, not unreasonably regarded the expedition as inopportune and even suspicious. (These sentiments were reflected in his conversations with Sir Percy Cox in December. He reminded the Chief Political Officer that the Wahabis recognised no Khalil after the first four, and was careful to add that if the Sharif should assume the title it would make no difference to his status among other ruling Chiefs.) In June of the following year the Sharif rose in open rebellion against the Turks and declared the independence of the Arabs. Ibn Sa’ud, writing in July to the Chief Political Officer, acknowledged the receipt from him of official news with regard to the Hijaz, expressed his satisfaction at the discomfiture of the Turks, but put forward his own apprehensions that the Sharif might proceed to claim authority over parts of Najd, and in support of this fear observed that in declaring the independence of “the Arabs” the Sharif appeared to treat them as a compendious whole, an attitude which he regarded with anxiety. 12. In August he wrote again, saying that he had now received a letter from the Sharif in which the latter announced the occupation of Mecca and asked him for his help. Ibn Sa’ud gave a summary of his reply, and a copy of the original letter has since been received. He assured the Sharif that he would render all assistance which was in his power, but asked for a written under taking that the Sharif would abstain from trespassing in his territory or interfering with his subjects. Ibn Sa’ud went on to ask Sir Percy Cox whether his relations with the Sharif might be regarded as a matter which affected the two chiefs alone, or whether they touched on our interests, in which case he would be guided by our wishes. According to Arab reports received at Kuwait the Sharif wrote three times to Ibn Sa’ud asking for aid, and on two occasions sent him 2,0001. Not improbably there is some truth in the rumoured remittance of small sums. 13. The Sharif’s answer, dated 5th September, to Ibn Sa’ud’s letter was, to say the least of it, unconciliatory, and aroused bis lively indignation. His letter and the draft undertaking which had been sent with it for the Sharif’s acceptance were sent back with the observation that Ibn Sa’ud’s request could emanate only from a man bereft of reason. About the same time Ibn Sa’ud received a letter from ’Ali Haidar acquainting him with his appointment as Sharif in place of Husain by the Ottoman Government, and calling on him to join the Jihad ; but in his reply Ibn Sa’ud expressed the resentment felt by the Arabs towards him and towards the Tu rks. 14. The Chief Political Officer dealt at length with the Hijaz question in a letter to Ibn Sa’ud dated 19th October. He ^pointed out how important it was to the Arab cause, which it was the policy of the British Government to support, that all the great Arab Chiefs should work together and inS 1 $ co-operation with us in the common task of expelling the Turks from Arabia. As to Ibn Sa’ud’s own position, he need have no misgivings, for he had been acknowledged by us to be an independent ruler, and the Sharif must recognise the full import of the treaty. The British Government had no reason to believe that he entertained any hostile intentions against the tribes and territories of Najd. 15. In the negotiation over the treaty in December 1915, Sir Percy Cox had discussed with Ibn Sand the possibility of his giving .us assistance against Ibn Rashid. The Hakim of Najd then thought that Ibn Rashid would 'either come in or maintain a strict neutrality ; if, however, he showed himself actively hostile, Ibn Sa’ud would attack him and incite the northern bVnazah against him. This intention, however, he failed to carry out. During the sprin°' and summer of 1916 he was occupied with a rebellion of the Murrah, following on, and perhaps connected with, that of the ’Ajman, which endangered his communications with the Hasa. though a large piopoition of the^hediting men of the Shammar had gone north with Ibn Rashid against the ’Iraq -no effective attack was made on Hail in their absence. In late June or ’early July, Ibn Sa’ud’s son, Turki, raided Jabal Shammar, and the news may have hastened Ibn Rashid’s retreat from our frontieis. In September or October Turki renewed hostilities against some of the Shammar Shaikhs and an allied section of the Harb, but the affair resulted onlv in the capture of a small amount of booty, and Ibn Saud sdoctoi, passing through Bahrein, brought a message to the effect that the Aimr could do nothing against the Shammar as long as the tugiUve Aiman remained on his flank. The true reason for his inactivity was no doubt Ins own insecurity at home, but the implacable hostility which he entertained toward the ’Ajman, whom he regarded not only as rebels, but as the munleieis of his brother Sa’ud, threatened to become a problem of some dithculty. 1G When Shaikh Mubarak died in December 1915, Ibn Sa nd pressed his ' son and successor in Kuwait, Jabir, to drive out the ’Ajman Shaikhs, dabir made a temperate reply. He was unwilling to eject the Ajman, feunng that they would be thrown into the enemy camp ; but he could not hold ot t ■mainst' Ibn Sa’ud’s insistence without creating an open breach, and lie expelled the tribe in February 1910. As lie anticipated, they turned lot protection first to ’Ajaimi and then to Ibn Rashid, but in May they asket ■\nil obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly near sXan and subsequently several of the leading Shaikhs made submission to’us ’ When Ibn Rashid returned to Hail only two of the ’Ajman Shaikhs remained with ’Ajauni and they had little or no following. Ibn Sa ud s ardent desire to direct his energies upon the extermination of tins tube was not o- Ath which we had tuny sympathy, at all events at the present juncture. 17 Shaikh Jabir, new to his office, could not hope to exercise the ndluence over ibn Sa’ud which had been possessed by that practised ancl , ^ dinlomatist his father; moreover, for some years before Mubarak s deat , .J qt - . between Riyadh and Kuwait had been growing cooler. Ibn fea ud bitterly resented Mubarak's attitude during the negotiations We«rhtm»sU onrl the Ottoman Government in the spring ol 1914. Accoium^ 10 account the Shaikh had at first counselled him to-accept the iurkish offieis but when he reached Kuwait in April, Mubarak changed Ins note wi kout e^ion arid adW^ SoTnd!Tan! w:as the Amir that he expressly stipulated with Captain Shakespear that Mubarak should not be consulted m the negotiations yth bhaKespeai V . a ’ A j mall wa s another grievance, and in tflTn SVud comfiafned of .the incidence of the transit dues which had been, from time immemorial, levied m Kuwait. 18. While Ibn ouredvls hadTt reached a satisfactory understanding with each othei, cthere was evidence that the Turks were still active in Arabia. News was received from Ibn Sa’nd and from other sources of the despatch of an agent (Muhammad Taufiq ibn Fara’un of Damascus) for the purpose of buying- camels for the Ottoman Government; the emissary was web chosen, for he was a personal friend of Ibn Sa’ud and had visited Najd on the same business the previous year. But on this occasion the Amir was pressed by us to prevent him from obtaining camels ; he accordingly arrested Ibn Fara’un, confiscated 700 camels which had been purchased in the interior, and sent them to Kuwait. Various reports, some of which came from Ibn Sa’ud, indicated that another attempt to stir up Ibn Kashid against us was in the wind. Rushaid Ibn Lailah, Ibn Rashid’s representative at Con stantinople, joined him at Hail, with a few German and Turkish officers, a small body of Turkish soldiers, and some guns ; accounts varied as to the exact composition of the mission, but its presence in Hail in some form' seemed fairly certain. Ibn Sa’ud had written in September that he would be glad of a personal interview with the Chief Political Officer to discuss the question of co-operation with the Sharif or offensive action against Ibn Rashid. In October he repeated the request urgently, and on all grounds it seemed advisable to accede to it. Sir Percy Cox met him at Ojair on 11 th November. Ibn Sa’ud explained to him his position in detail. He had lost considerably in men and material in the fight with Ibn Rashid in January 1915. Since then he had been almost continuously in the field, first against the ’Ajman and then against the Murrah. Most of the normal trade of Najd was with Syria, and the tribes were accustomed to sell their camels to Damascene dealers ; the strict blockade imposed by Ibn Sa’ud—the seizure of Ibn Fara’un’s camels bore witness to its reality—grew more and more galling; the Najdis grumbled, the tribes were restless, all asked wherein lay the advantage to themselves of their Chief’s attitude, and it was increasingly difficult for him to keep them in hand. With regard to the Sharif, Sir Percy Cox was able to give Ibn Sa’ud the fullest reassurance. Our treaty with the Amir had been communicated to Mecca, and when the Sharif announced to us his intention of proclaiming himself King of the Arabs on 5th November, we had insisted on a formal admission that he claimed no jurisdiction over independent rulers. The news of the coronation at Mecca had not yet reached Central Arabia, and was not discussed. During conversation with the Chief Political Officer at Basrah, Ibn Sa’ud made a passing remark about the Sharif’s calling himself Sultan, but his mind seemed to be set completely at rest on hearing that his rights were safeguarded by us, and that the Sharif had explicitly denied any design on the independence of himself or his com peers. . 19. Ibn Sa’ud having expressed to the Chief Political Officer at their meet ing at Ojair his inclination to pay a brief visit to Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait before i etui mug home, the project was cordially encouraged as appearing eminently expedient, and Sir Percy Cox recommended that he should be presented with the^K.C.I F. at a Majhs which was to be held at Kuwait where the nu m was to be invested with the C.S.I. When he intimated to Ibn Sa’ud that this honour was to be accorded to him, the Chief Political Officer was authorised to inform at the same time that his rights bad been carefully reserved m all dealings which the British Government had held with the obit aiK ^ )U UC ln 118 rep y sa ^ ^ at k® was entirely satisfied on this 20 . The Majlis took place on 20 th November. The Shaikh of Muhammarah had come to Kuwait for the occasion, and many Beduin were present, ncludmg the- friendly headmen of the Shammar Aslam and Dhafir and Shaikhs of the Mutair. The Chief Political Officer, in pKentini the ilecoiations, alluded to our satisfaction m feeling that the great Arab chiefs were bent with us upon a common purpose. The Shaikh of Muhammarah mllowed him with words which were warmly pro-British, and Ibn Sa’nd struck the keynote of the meeting m a speech which was as spontaneous as i n as unexpected. He said that the Turks had placed themselves outsidethe pale of Islam by the iniquities which they had committed on other Moslems. He contrasted their policy with that of Great Britain, pointing out that the Turks had sought to weaken the Arabs by fomenting their differences,-whereas the British Government encouraged them to unite in their own interest. He praised the action of the Sharif, and urged the obligation of all true Arabs to co-operate with him in forwarding the Arab cause. When he had brought his speech to an eloquent close, the three chiefs, Kuwait, Muhammarah, and Ibn Sa’ud, swore together that they would work with us for the achievement of a common end. 21. This scene made a deep impression on the local notables and on the Beduin Shaikhs present, who will, no doubt, carry the tale far and wide. During the receptions at Kuwait, Ibn Sa’ud showed in all his utterances how clearly he had grasped the principle which guides our relations with Arabia. He quoted as an example of Our benevolent policy towards the Arab cause the fact that we were ready even to promote a reconciliation between himself and Ibn Rashid if the latter would abandon his attitude of hostility. The arrival of Ibn Fara’ud’s TOO tine camels, each branded with the wasm of that well-known dealer, gave a dramatic completeness to the Kuwait gathering. 22. From Kuwait Ibn Sa’ud went to Muhammarah as the guest of Shaikh Khaz’al, who co-operated most heartily in the endeavour to make Ibn Sa’ud’s visit profitable to him. The two chiefs arrived at Basrah on the evening of 26th November. Early next morning the Chief Political Officer, accom panied by the two chief military representatives of the Army Commander present in Basrah, went on board the Shaikh’s launch and presented Ibn Sa’ud with a sword of honour and a message of welcome from the Army Commander. The day was spent m exhibiting to him the base camps and .organisation and the latest machinery of warfare, including the aircraft, in which he took an eager interest. Dhari ibn Twalah and Humud al Suwait, Shaikhs of the Shammar A slam and the Dhaffr, were present, while Shaikh Ibrahim oi Zubair and several Sunni notables of Basrah and refugees from Baghdad had an audience with Ibn Sa’ud on the launch. 23. The Kuwait Durbar and Ibn Sa’ud’s visit to Basrah have placed us in a singularly strong position. Three powerful chiefs have made public piotes- tation of their friendship with each other and their confidence in the British Government. A telegram received from the Sharif, congratulating them upon their zeal in the Arab cause and regretting that he had not had time to send a representative to Kuwait, confirmed the identity of his aims with their own, and in a further message he apologised for any deficiencies in his previous letters, on the ground that while he was in the throes of war he might unintentionally fall short as a correspondent. Hie dream of Aiab unity which engaged the imagination of the Liberals of Damascus during t ic year before the war has been brought nearer fulfilment than diearns are wont to come, but the role of presiding genius.has been recast. Instead o the brilliant, unscrupulous Saiyid Talib, gyrating in the blast of his own ambition, the Chiefs of Eastern and Western Arabia have united at the instance of the British Government. 24. Besides this knitting together of Arab leaders, the meeting at Kuwait has produced certain immediate results. In the first place the extent and nature of Ibn Sa’ud’s share in future hostilities with Ibn Rashid, if such should occur, were agreed upon. He undertook^to maintain 4,000 men um ei arms ; if Ibn Rashid moved in force towards the Iraq, he would move up parallel with him towards Zubair and join the friendly tribes and a contingent from Kuwait, He informed the friendly Shaikhs that he would support them if Ibn Rashid threatened to attack them m strength. If, however, Ibn Rashid should remain at Hail, Ibn Sa ud would harass and attack him as opportunity offered, using the Qasnn as a base. In view o the strain upon his resources during the last two years, he has been gi e 3 000 rifles with ammunition, as well as four machine-guns, and gianted a monthly subsidy of 5 ,OOOL to cover the expenses he will incur in maintaining?'s“r ;- 1 arts! ESfibS.t.'tf “A »«- «-» request for them. °5 Secondly, a letter was written by Ibn Sand, m the name of the three chiefs to ’Aiaimi, Ibn Sa’ud urging upon him the Harm udnch he was doino-’to the Arab cause by his present attitude, inviting him to entei into communication with them and promising him Inendly consideration and an opportunity for honourable submission. 26 Finally, with the co-operation of Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait and the diplomatic skill of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who was throughout of the h ohest service to the Chief Political Officer, the uehcate problem raised by hf presence of the ’Ajman among the friendly tribes reaehed a satisfactory solution. For the period of the war a truce between Ibn Sa ud and the &gt; ^iman was agreed upon and instructions were drafted defining the position of the fugitive Shaikhs with respect to all tribes under our protection On his return to Basrah Sir Percy Cox called in the ’Ajman leaders Phey had been nrofoundly disquieted by the advent, of Ibn.Sa ud, thinking that it augured ill for themselves, hut the principal and more courageous headmen met the Chief Political Officer at Zubair and accepted the proposed terms, m return for which they were promised a monthly allowance similar to that received by the other friendly Shaikhs of the Shamiyah. They evinced little doubt that the remaining headmen of the ’Ajman, including the two who w-ere still with ’Ajaimi, would come in as soon as they heard of the happy issue of their own venture. 27. Letters have been written to Fahad Beg Ibn Hadhdhal informing him of the Kuwait meeting and inviting him to join the league of Arab Chiefs in . expelling the Turks. These have been sent through a man from Fahad Beg’s tents who was in Basrah at the time of Ibn Sa’ud’s visit and went to see him at Muhammarah, where he received advice and instructions from Shaikh Khaz’al in full measure. He was entrusted also with letters from the Sharif which have been waiting opportunity of despatcli to Fahad Beg, Hachim al Muhaid, ’All Sulaiman of the Bulaim and others, and with presents in money to guide Fahad Beg’s decision and to encourage the amicable disposition of the Shaikh of the Dahamshalg Jaza’ ibn Mijlad. Communications of the same nature are on their way to Atiyah al Qulal of Flajaf and Muhammad ’Ali Kamunah of Karbala.

No, 15 . ( 25577) t CAIRO. 27th January, 1913. Sir:- I have the honour to forward a report by Commander D. G. Hogarth, R.N.V.R., on his recent interviews with King Hussein at Jeddah, together with the translations of three letters handed by the King to Commander Hogarth for conveyance to me. I have no doubt that the conversations, at several of which Mr. H. St. J.B. Philby, I.C.S., was present, have served a useful purpose and that 'the mutual exchange of views on the various subjects of discussion has been advantageous. . Commander Hogarth carried out his mission with much discretion and skin and evidently made a great and very favourable impression on King Hussein. Copies of this report and attachments have been sent to India and Bagdad. I have, &amp;c. , (Signed) Reginald Wingate. The Right Honourable Arthur James Balfour, O.M., M.P.,TRANSLATION. To. H. E. THE HIGH COMMISSIONER, CAIRO. Mr. Philby communicated to me the object of his mission of which Your Excellency is of course well aware. He also requested me to explain what I communicated to Your Excellency, whether direct or through the Agent at Jeddah, regarding Ibn Saud. Finally he told me that he is desirous or rather that it is the desire of His Majesty's Government that I should be on good terms with the said Emir. My reply in the first matter was that I thought it necessary from a military point of view to communicate all such information (above referred to) to my partners in action viz. the British Government. If however his (Mr Philby's) information did not agree with the communica tions I made, there was, I believed, no objection to his communicating his information to the superior authority with which he was concerned. In the same way, there is no objection to a person like me communicating to His Majesty's Goverament anything which he thinks worthy 01 being communicated. As to the second matter, considering that the object is to safeguard the common interests all over the country, especially as far as the said Emir is concerned, therefore, in the event of my doing anything^ that might harm the said interests, I beg that Your Excellency will notify me and I will at once put things right. As long as the main objects is to safeguard the common interests and as long as they are safe, any other matters are insignificant and under all circumstances may God grant us success.

THE HIGH COMMISSIONER, CAIRO. It gave me very great pleasure to meet Commandant Hogarth and Mr. Philby and I learnt verbally from the former that the monthly allotment has been increased. I presume this increase is meant to meet the expenses in the North and I have no hesitation in expressing my deep gratitude. As I am sure Your Excellency is well aware that I am very particular and I feel much concerned xor the ex penditure of any money paid from the treasury 01 Great Britain, although it may be so trifling as 25 'daniks” (paras) unless it is expended in the right way; therefore I need make no further explanation. I ask the Almighty God to help and support us. Dated 27/3/1936/. December 31st. 1917. (Signed) Yours Sincerely HUSSEIN. Letter from King Hussein of Hegaz to H. E.

The eminent gentleman, Commander Hogarth, communi cated to me the following declaration which was written on ordinary paper (meaning that it was not an official document) M That the Allies have made up their minds that the Arab nation should he given a full chance of becoming 'a nation' once again (i.e. to unite and become once again a real That this could not be reached unless the Arabs themselves unite and that Great Britain and her Allies will adopt the policy that would lead to that end'. I therefore say that such a noble act which is un precedented in history is not strange seeing that it comes from Great Britain. Great Britain has planted a tree and it is natural that she will look after it unuil it grows and bears fruit. However, what seems to me important is that the Arabs,in face of this noble deed in which every one of them, whether living to day or in the future, shares until the end of days, should resort to the Almignty to are the real type of Arabs who claim to be faithful and repay all kindness and obligations, should support Great ed with my own great share of this kindness, I see that I to repay it.

However I find no harm in refreshing your mind as to what appeared in Djemal’s deceitful letter to Faisel, namely how Djemal already threatens our noble cause by playing on the minds of the simple Arabs and other Mohammedans, saying that Great Britain intended to occupy such and such a territory and France intended to occupy such and such a territory etc., which I am sure Your Excellency will refrain from discussing. All the same I beg the Almighty to give you all support and success and please accept my kind regards. Dated 27/3/1336 ' . , December 31st, 1917. (Signed) Yours sincerely HUSSEIN Letter from King Hussein of Hegaz to H. E. The High \ Commissioner in Cairo.REPORT ON MISSION TO JEDDAH.' 15. 1. 18. TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE HIGH COMMISSIONER, CAIRO. In accordance with your instructions I ieft Cairo on 2nd January and Suez on 3rd by H.M.S. ’’SUVA' and arrived on 6 th at Jeddah. I learned there that King Hussein intended to leave Mecca on the following day and to receive me on the 8 th. Mr. H. St. J. B, Philoy, I.L.S. who had gpne to RIADH as part of our 'NEJD MISSION' to I BN SAUD and had come thence in 17 days to TAIF and 4 days more to JEDDAH, had been waiting there since January 1st. He reported that after his departure from TAIF with 15 of his men, KING HUSSEIN had summoned the rest of his men and camels to MECCA, and he suspected the latter of an intention to forbid his return to TAIF. This suspicion agreed with an indication already noted in a telegram from the King to his Cairo Agent, and I communicated it at once to you. I spent the 6 th and 7th in hearing Mr. PHILBY’3 report of his Mission and journey and in dis cussing the situation between the King and IBN SAUD. The King arrived at JEDDAH in the evening of the 7tL and received me, with Mr. PHILBY and Colonel BASSETT, on the morning of the 8 th. Between that date and the 14th when I left in H.M.S. 'HABDINGE', I had in all. ten interviews with His Highness including his formal call on the British Agency on the 11th and his visit 1,0 H.M.S. 'HARDINGE' on the 14th. Of the conversations during these interviews, I have made the notes appended mo this report, and Colonel Bassett also made notes which he has communicated/I iVhlg i983j| m oj m 2 . 3. 4. 5, A- 6. V't rw-4'' communicated to the ARAB BUREAU. In regard to the second interview on January 8 th when, owing to the King's rapid and excited utterance in talking to Mr. Philby, some of his words were not fully translated, Colonel Bassett’s notes add important details missed by me. Some of the talk turned on topics not of immediate political importance, but of interest for recent Arab history, topography, natural and social history economics etc. These I usually introduced not only for the sake of Intelligence, but to relieve tension or dispose the King favourably towards less congenial topics, he obviously being pleased to talk about his own career, lineage, country and so forth. The main subjects, however, of the conversations were these:- IBN SAUD and the political and religious situation of NEJD in their relation to HEJAZ, the Gulf Coast and MESOPOTAMIA, JEBEL-SHAMMAR, and the Arab Cause generally. ARAB unity and the King's actual and possible relation to it. International control of the Palestine Holy Places. Settlement of Jews in PALESTINE and common Cause among Arabs, Jews and Armenians in Syria. The situation in ASIR and YEM EN. The Agreements of the King with Great Britain and Prance. The King hardly touched on Mesopotamia and neither said nor asked anything of importance aoout the future of either BAGHDAD or BASRA. I was careful to leu these | questions, as far as possible, alone and he ne^er seemed j desirous of raising them. In regard, to the other subjects I hereoy supplemenu the appended notes with a summary of the upshot of the conversation as a whole, and an appreciation ol uhe situation/'have been left by the interviews. I succeeded in convincing the King that we, for our part, do not believe IBN BAUD to have been guilty of treachery on any of the main counts which the former alleges against the latter; that we intend to respect our treaty with IBN BAUD and to treat him as a friend unless and until he proves himself an enemy: that we expect the King to respect his territorial and tribal rights and to treat him correctly: and that our support is not to be looked for by the King either in hostile action against IBN BAUD or in any claim he may wish to make to Suzerainty over NEJD. Further that, should we think fit to arm IBN BAUD and encourage him to attack HAIL, we shall consider such action perfectly compatible with both the Arao Cause and our Agreements with the King. But the latter remains as unconvinced as ever of IBN BAUD’S bona f ides either towards himself or towards us. He puts our belief aside as mistaken and is not affected by the counter-evidence on which it is based (N.o. the most positive of this evidence, being derived from a secret source, could not be laid before him by me. ) He both fears IBN BAUD as a centre of a religious movement, dangerous to the HEJAZ, and hates him as irreconcilable to his own pretension to be “King of the Arabs”. This latter uitie is the King’ s dearest am biti on, partly no doubt, in the interests of Arab unity, which he constantly says, wioh some reason, can never be realised until focussed on a central personality. He opposes to our argument tha^ he cannot be “King of the Arabs” till the Araos in geneiaj. desire him to be so, the counuer-argumeno that they will never/(/£?) /20 never so desire till he is so called; and he drought • forward more than once the plea, that, if we destroy the one great Moslem Power; TURKEY, we are hound in our own interest, to set up another. The resultant situation, however, is that the King is very unlikely to provoke a conflict with IBN BAUD while the European War lasts. He is too weak, too much occupied, and, I think, too sincerely desirous of doing what we wish. His loyalty to us is a matter not merely of self interest, hut of sentiment. Nor do I think he will promote any underhand intrigue against what he knows we believe to he our interest. But he will remain ohstinate- ly of his own opinion and will watch for any action of IBN BAUD’S, e. g. against any other Arab State, which can he represented as proof that the latter is no pan-Arab and no true friend to us. The King did not impress me as being at all well informed on East Arabian or Mesopotamian affairs. He evidently hopes to be in a position one day to count JEBEL SHAMMAR to himself, and he will not welcome any action of ours which tends either to put it into IBN BAUD’S hands or to securb its independence for s the future: but he seemed to have no plan of action to wards that end, and will bow to our will in the meantime. 2. It is obvious that the King regards Arab Unity as synonymys with his own Kingship, and (for reasons given above) as a vain phrase unless so regarded. He treats our proclamations and exhortations about it as good inten tions but no more and has no faith in their effect until we support the embodiment of the idea in one single personality - himself. 'Arab Unity' means very little to King HUSSEIN except as a means to his personal aggrand isement. He made this very clear in the matter of the message to JERUSALEM Arabs which I was asked to suggest to/5. The King despises IDRISSI from the bottom of his heart and cannot see why we should support and use him: but as long as the latter keeps south of QUNFUDAH, he does not mind what he does at present. He does not regard him as a traitor in any way and he recognizes him as a friend of ours, but an unworthy friend. As for the IMAM YEHIA, the King thinks him a v irt ual nonentity, with no actual hold on the ZEIDI tribes. He gave no indication of any desire to interfere in the IMAM's affairs or in YEMEN. 6. As regards our Agreements with himself, the King volunteered (apropos of nothing in particular) the declaration that he recognized the possible necessity of modifications owing to the course of the war and changes in the mutual relations of the Allies. He has real trust in the honour of Great Britain, out very little in uhat of France: and undoubtedly he expects differences of opinion to arise among the Allies before ano at the Peace Conference. I think he has some hope of forcing France's hand when it comes to the point, and expects us to back him. He lived too long in Constantinople not to have imbibed the policy of playing one Power against another. He listened to my protestation of our perxect accord with France, and of the latter's good intentions towards the Arabs, with politeness, but lack of conviction. In conclusion I may say that the King is more as sured than ever both of our power to help' him and the Arabs, and of our intention to do so, and that he leaves himself confidently in our hands. But he is not easy m his mind either about Central Arabia or about the loyalty of his own Hejaz people. Mainly on this last ground he was really perturbed by Mr. Philby's arrival at TAIF, and ostensibly//H r &gt; ostensibly on that ground he refused to let him return that way. A mistake was made by us in not letting the King know of the possibility of Mr. Philby’s arrival, which could have been done a week before it actually took place. But it would still have annoyed him greatly, since, in addition, he sees in it an indication that we regard IBN BAUD as on an equality with himself. The irritability, which he showed whenever IBN BAUD’S name came up, was, I am sure, mainly due to Mr. Philby’s journey. But his shame of showing it found expression not only in constant apologies, but also in almost excessive readiness to oblige me in every other matter brought up for discussion. His manner towards me was most cordial throughout, and he took very well any unwelcome statement which I had to make. He sent me a handsome present of a native dress and dagger at the last and visited the ship to see me off. With Mr. Philby he comported himself, even when most contradictory and impracticable, less in anger than sorrow, and ended two of the most heaoed discussions not only with apologies to us all but an impulsive kiss to Mr Philby. He is quite firm in his friendship to us, but none too firm on his throne. (Signed) D. G. Hogarth.EXTRACTS FROM NOTES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH KING HUSSEIN. King protested did not wish discuss Baud. Small importance and powerless. Also bad faith proved by (a) correspondence with Fakhri through El Falaji; (b) fur thering Yemen money £. T.25. OOO. (c) Return home from Bureidah instead of attacking Rashid, (dj Incitement of Wahhabis to attack King’s Ateibah. Philby countered these accusations, especially (a) and (b) saying he had Fakhri’s actual letters to show King, and asking King to produce his Yemen witness to (b). King promised this for to-morrow. Asked about desirability SAUD attacking HAIL in Arab Cause, King protested SAUD could not and would not, HAIL of small importance: not real distributing centre enemy supplies., i.e. Qasim under SAUD, and AJEIMI should be dealt with first in interest of Mesopotamia communica tions. After that Kail would not matter. Reminded of ABDULLAH'S letter to SAUD, said ABDULLAH had noc asked SAUD to attack HAIL. But if H. M. Government so desired let SAUD try and if in 3 months not successful, King would take it on. He even would send 500 camelmen and help SAUD. I asked if he would agree to (a) sink differ ences during war, (b) treat SAUD correctly as friend, atd (c) not claim control of ATEIBAH in NEJD territory. King acquiesced readily in all. King explained how delay Northern Operations had prevented own plans of dealing with HAIL, where reigning RASHID must cease and SHaMMAR would choose best successor from the family. He then stated his knowledge of SAUD’s designs on KOWEIT, ANEIZAH BUREIDAB/BUREIDAH and SHAKERA, now supplying HAIL, would stand with KOWEIT. Spoke bitterly of WAHHABIS who called him an in fidel as much as us. Returned to his accusations of SAUD and obviously ended unconvinced. Insisted Qasim really with himself as well as all Ateibah and Mateir and most SHAMMAR, AJMAN guilty of no treachery to SAU'D. King repeated very carefully and slowly yesterday's declarations that he was entirely in Great Britain's hands, that his personal feelings to SAUD would not affect his co-operation and that in due time we should know what SAUD really is. He himself was out for the good of humanity and the Muslemin, best served by Alliance with Great Britain. I read Foreign Office Formula No 1 (Arab Nation and need of Unity) King assented cordially saying it expressed the basis of all our Agreement. I said that owing to long lapse of time Allies thought it well to repeat it now. King then said that if any minor modifications of our Agreements with him were imposed on us by war necessities he would frankly recognise such necessity, but asked he should be as frankly informed of modifies tion and necessity. I then introduced Formula No 2 (International Administration in Palestine) by reminding King of proviso in original Agreements safeguarding special interests j of our ALLIES and especially FRANCE. He moerpolcted humourous reference to FASHODA, implying doubt of real and permanent coirammity of interest between FRANCE and us. I let this pass with gesture of dissent and saio. FNANCL had come to see eye to eye with us in Arab matters, favoured as much as we FEISAL's plans, took the view so strongly held in AMERICA that peoples should have the government they desire, and wished only to protect and assist the development/development of independent Government in SYRIA. I then read No 2. King assented saying that drain which could formulate this could devise form of adminis tration to safeguard all interests. He lauded Great Britain's action in case OMaR MOSQUE comparing Caliph OMAR's abstention from Christian shrines in JERUSALEM. If we would draw up statement similar to No 2. with omission of reference to political administrative control, he would publish it to all ISLAM. I passed to Formula No 3 (Jewish Settlement in Palestine) prefacing it by statement of growth of ZIONISM during war and great value of Jew interest and alliance. King seemed quite prepared for formula and agreed enthusiastically saying he welcomed Jews to all Arab lands. I explained that His Majesty’s Government’s resolve safeguarded existing local population. I then opened question of delegate to London Arab- Jew-Armenian Committee. King asked anxiously what powers of Committee would be and if its decisions final. I told him advisory only and His Majesty's Govemmenu reserved all decisions and action. Then I said delagaue must know English well and suggested FUAD EL KHATIB, King refused him with emphasis and said no Shami or Iraqi. AH these tarred with Turk brush and he feared existing members of Committee might be in enemy pay. He had no one to send who knew English. Could we find a Hindi? X said this would not be required representative. In any case would we suggest a suitable men and if he approved he woujd delegate him.? PHILBY opened about FAKHRI's unanswered letters to IBN BAUD, originals of which IBN BAUD had given to PHILBY and PHILBY now produced. KingKing refused to have these letters read or to look at them protesting they were all a blind. King absolutely declined to be persuaded from first to last. He again and again reiterated his old grievances and convictions, but asserted they did not and would net affect his action or policy and finally PHILBY gave it up, as the King became over excited and it was plainly useless to persist. Before we took leave at 7 p. m. King begged pardon for his vehemence, saying it were better he should never report IBN SAUD' s crimes to us, if it led to such dis- . cussions. Then he kissed PHILBY. Bassett hung back and managed when alone with the King to tell him consents of one letter in which FAKHRI complained he had had no re plies and Bassett explained our sole object in bringing up this subject was to try and remove one out of many causes of King’s mistrust of IBM SAUD. Philby broached question of his return via TAIF. King emphatically refused to sanction it, saying political effect of his arrival had been disastrous, as much to us as King. One bad error must not be added to another. Far better lose a little time going round by India. Everyone now talking. Bassett tried again after Philty and I had withdrawn; stated H.C's strong desire, hut King replied, though never refused H.G. before, must now. Told Bassett 'officially' Philby would not leave JEDDAH by land. Became so excited that Bassett promised he would not re open subject unless King, on reflection sent for him to do SO. Conversation with BASSETT on method of regulating merchants' prices. KING detailed his plan of Co-operative Society with shares at PlOO of which Government had taken l,OOC: to begin slowly with three or four commodities only e. g. Petroleum/Petroleum, rice, barley and sugar. To be managed by Committee already appointed after Me Hiss of leading merchants held the other day. Has capital already of £9,000. Expressed certainty of honest management (?) and will appoint agents at YEMBO, WEJH and AKABA, but for last did not receive favourably name of MOhammed WAGIH and evidently is in difficulty about personnel. The MECCA Co operative Society has already four branches. In JEDDAH to be one large selling establishment. Has already taken 500 sacks rice and 500 sugar from JEDDAH Army Store to start it and already made profit on this which is to go to the British Government. Prices of this fixed by local rates (this news to Bassett who had been assured two days ago not taken). Asked if he wished part of subsidy to be with held and spent on commodities for this Co-operative Society King did not reply certainly. Would see and go slow at first. Cordially agreed right object was # to freeze out the small amateur merchants, but demurred to Bassett’s statement that they went up the coast by scores under guise of soldiers each with about two tons ’’baggage' (Basseto cited case of ARETHUSA which had to refuse dhow loads the other day), saying that NEJD tribes now sending to HEJAZ for food vice KOWEIT and what tOHSEN and Co sent up the coast was for these: e.g. 700 camels came to YEMBO the other day (HUHI interpolated that they went off loaded up with Government stores, fraudulently filched by ABDUL QaDIR EL ABDU &amp; Co).' But King said he meant to control all depar tures now from MECCA.! Difficulty was that big merchants sold off cargo of ships before arrival to small men, who had no shops or clerks, but stored £15 to £20 woruh j.n their houses and held it up till big merchants had run out; then emerged and sold high. Had now issued orders no one to trade unless has a shop and clerks. King evidently cannot trust/truso i is police to enforce maximum prices and wants to get in Government competition on actual markets; but also has an idea he can so also get hulk of Commercial since it (a) will get all merchants against King: (b) will not De effective unless very large Government Stocks, (c) If these collected, it will be partly at Army's ex pense and will end by overstocking HEJAZ. miOLmiNG. King stated intention of visiting our King after war accompanied by all his sons, 'GEORGES IBN EDOARD'. Reverted to IBN SAUD, once more protesting personal good will but strong political distrust of him. Intrigues brewing on the Gulf which are not for good of Arab Nation. Will turn the other cheek to Ibn Saud if we wish. If we would recognise 'King of the Arabs', all would be well and all Arabs would listen. I said time for this not yet. Philby protested re IBN SAUD but King would not listen. King sent his two messages to H.E. and King George. (a) The master of MECCA and MEDINA must be of standing to satisfy MOSLEMS, as well as firmest Ally of Great Britain. (b) He must write good page of history. There must be no doubt■ of his good faith. After visit to ship, firing-practice, inspection and refreshments, I took occasion to state very plainly that, while thankful to King for speaking frankly about IBN SAUD, we have a treaty with latter which he has not broken. Until he does so, we shall observe it strictly and consider him a friend, treaties being sacred things which have all equal claim upon us. King replied with protest of personal goodwill to IBN SAUD ahd repeated solemn warning 10 to 15% - for himself. Bassett unconvinced about/about Gulf Affairs, saying AJEIMI contemplated something against KOWEIT and implying that IBN SAUD would stand in with him. Said he fully understood about our Treaty with latter and that those who respect treaties, respect all alike.

(19580) THE RESIDENCY, | ^ CAIRO, { 1913 8 137 ( 2 - ''' m: January 11th, 1918. Sir:- I have the honour to forward a note on the conversations held last month by Colonel C.E.Wilson and Major K. Cornwallis with the Emir Abdalla. The latter has given his opinion with considerable frankness and appears to take a generally moderate and statesmanlike view of future political conditions in the Arabian Peninsula. Copies of this note have been sent to India, Aden and Baghdad. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Reginald Wingate. ^ iNote on ConversationG held with the Emir Abdulla by Colonel Wilson and Major Cornwallis, at Abu Markha, Hejaz during December 1917. GENERAL POLICY. The Emir Abdulla on numerous occasions referred to our treaty obligations with Ibn Saud and the Idrissi which, he said, would always be fully upheld by his | father and himself. He always spoke sincerely and gratefully about the help which he has received from the British Government, and of the assistance which he expected in the future in the moulding of the Arab race. He wishes to bring about unity and concord in the Arabian Peninsula by peaceful means, and considers that this can best he attained if the several principal chiefs are completely independent in their own dominions, on the proviso that they make some recognition of the suzerainty of the King of the Arabs. He said that the greatest handicaps in conducting the Arab revolt, leaving out of account the attitude of Ibn Saud and the Idrissi, had been the lack of trustworthy subordinates in the Arab ranks, which had thrust an unfair burden on the shoulders of the King and his four sons. It would be useless for the King to try and dominate the Peninsula by force with such lieutenants, even if he wished to, and he, personally, would like to see a number of strong and friendly rulers governinggoverning justly their subjects and acting fairly by their overlord. In this he shows a greater wisdom than his father, who, I suspect, would nrefer a collection of punnet rulers with himself as the one strong man. In the remarks which follow, the Emir may seem to depart from this ideal, especially in his altitude towards Ibn Saud, but it must be remembered that, at the present time, relations between them are not far from the breaking point, and that he feels that he must make out the best case possible for his own side. It is quite probable that he does not himself believe all the charges which he has male, for he admitted getting most of his information from certain border elements who were Wahhabis to Ibn Saud and Sunnis to him and who might be reaping an advantage by selling false information to both sides. He is merely carrying on the duel which began i when his father originally claimed the Ateiba. He has gained ground during the last year by lavish gifts to their chief Sheikhs, and Ibn Saud - having little money - has countered by intensifying his Wahhabi campaign. This has alarmed the Emir who is, perhaps, inclined to exaggerate his real feelings when speaking to us. But, strained though the situation is, it is not necesgar ily incapable of solution. I cannot speak of Ibn Saud hut many conversations with the Kmir convinced me that he will act fairly, if fairly met. He frequently referred to the resnonsibility which rested on the organisers of the Arab revolt,of making tteAr* coun tries more peaceful and prosperous than they had been under the rule of the Turks, and said that all their effortsefforts would have been in vain if civil war followed on the removal of the restraining Ottoman hand. 1. IBM BAUD AND I3N RASHID.- The Emir showed very plainly that he dislikes Ibn Saud and is orofoundly distrustful of his intentions. On one occasion he went so far as to call him the son of a dog, and remarked that his family had always been noted for its treachery and that the present Emir and his son, Turki, were true to stock. His view was that Ibn Saud had, up to the present time, played a clever game which had been successful in deceiving us as to his real aims. He probably liked us, and he certainly disliked the Turks, but, in spite of that, he had realised that it was to his interest to keep in with them and Ibn Rashid secretly, for, once they had disappeared from the Hejaz, King Hussein would be the most nowerful man in Arabia, and his own schemes would be thwarted. This contingency was more to be feared by him than any danger from the English or the Turks. Basing his policy on these considerations, he had secretly squared Ibn Rashid and the Turks and then made his treaty with us. What had been the result ? He had been consistently inactive, pleading lack of money and arms while all the time he was helping the enemy by allowing suonlies to pans from the East to Hail. Emir Abdulla was certain that he was in direct communica tion with Fakhri Pasha at the present time, and undertook to try and intercept his messengers as proof. He did not explain why he had not already done so. Ibn Seud had endeavoured to Play the same game with KingKing Hussein as he had with us. Last year he had publicly alluded in the mosque at Bureidah to the Sheriff revolt, hailing him as the saviour of the Arabs and exhorting everyone to join the Holy Cause against the Turks. Secretly, however, he had instigated his Imams to preach a counter propaganda. His letters to the King had throughout been extremely friendly in tone and well calculated to impress anyone who was not on his guard. They were all a part of his policy of deceit, but were partially inspired by fear. It was fear for his personal safety, for instance, and not » i T 4 - . fc illness, which had turned the Imam Abdurrahman back from the pilgrimage. (W s 4^ The crowning nroof of Ibn Baud’s insincerity was contained in his replies to two letters which the Emir had sent him, the first in torch 1917,' and the second after Ibn Rashid had reached Medain Saleh. The Emir was unable to produce copies of these letters,' but one morning wrote down, in the presence of Colonel Wilson and myself, the gist of the first. Its translation runs as follows H Let it be known to my brother the Imam that I am here as one of the best allies ( supporters) to him viz, in what would be in the interest end for the welfare of the Arab community and for its prestige . Prom what I have experienced all this long time, I find I cannot help telling you frankly that the fact of your remaining in the 'Imara” (Emirship, namely that you keen your nost as Emir) of your Fathers and Forefathers is indispensable to our cause ( or interest). We also wish that the family of Abdel Aziz ibn Abdel Rahman should be next to you in authority ( or it might mean succeed you) as this would ensure unity and exchanging friendly feelings between you and ourselves, as in this way the Arabs willbecome powerful and will be looked upon with respect ( or ewe). I inform you that this idea is common among us, namely my Father and Brothers, and I am giving you this information in my capacity of being a member of the Royal Family, and as Foreign Minister to the Hashimite Government* Therefore, be easy at mind and form your relations and interests with His Majesty the King according to these corOTunications w . ( NOTE :- Words in brackets are inserted by translator; original Arabic is rather obscure.) The Emir stated that this letter was received with great pleasure by Ibn Saud, who read it aloud in his assembly and acknowledged it suitably, saying that he was the King’s servant and would give him all help in his power. On the strength of this statement and after Ibn Rashid’s retreat to the railway, the Emir wrote the second letter to Ibn Saud, saying that the moment for attacking Hail was favourable and inviting his co-operation. Ibn Saud acknowledged the receipt of this letter, but entirely ignored the proposal, merely making general enquiries about the Emir’s health. At that time, said the Emir, Hail was entirely unprotected, and its inhabitants and the neighbouring # tribes bewildered and without a leader or a. policy. With Sherifian help, its fall would have been a certainty s and he could only conclude that Ibn Saud had some ul terior motive in refusing the offer. He had said nothing about the future possession of Hail but bad been quite prepared to see it fall into Ibn baud’s hands. It. was unfortunate that the Emir was unable to produce copies of these letters, for they furnish the first instance we have had of any definite proposal emanatingemanating from the Bheritian side of Ibn Baud. Whether the King would have ratified them is open to doubt, in view of his statements at Jedda, and indeed it is difficult to understand why Sherif Abdulla should have gratuioously offered to increase the power of a man whom he openly accuses of being hostile to his father and himself. He went on to say that Ibn Baud’s action had caused him to look round for a successor to Ibn Rashid. None of the latter's family were of proper age; Subha,n was doubtless aiming at power, but was untrustworthy, and, so far as he could see, Dhari, who was at present with the King of Mecca was the most suitable candidate. Unfortunately, he was of the A1 Ubeid branch of the house, which was not so popular as that of the A1 Abdulla but the Emir hoped that he might be accepted. I think that both the King and the Emir would welcome overtures from Ibn Rashid, provided they were backed by hostile action against the Turks, as affording the most satisfactory solution of the matter. They realise the importance, from their own point of view, of having an independent Hail to preserve the balance of power. 2. IBN BAUD AND THE WAHHABI DANGER .- For several days after our arrival, the Emir professed to make light of this movement which, he said, had been dangerous two years ago but had since declined. On the arrival of the news of Sultan ibn Bijad's raid, however, he veered round and continued, during our stay, to emphasise its seriousness. He placed all the responsibility on Ibn Baud who, he said, fanning the flame of fanaticism to further his own ambitions. The movement was a. difficult one to counter, since allall the central Hejaz tribes territory every year to get hates, and were there exposed to the full blast of Wahhabi influence. Induce ments to remain were offered to them, in the shape of presents of rifles and money, and any who professed the Wahabi faith were given places in which to settle. Ibn Saud, not content with perverting visiting tribesmen, had sent preachers amongst the outlying tribal elements of the Hejaz. Their methods were slow and insidious, and the rigour of their tenets annealed to the fanaticism which was latent amongst ignorant Bedu. There was only one way to treat such gentry, and that was to kill them, for they were undermining the religious foundations of the State. Colonel Wilson pointed out that the British Government would naturally do everything in its power to better the relations between Ibn Saud and the King, but that it had always been its policy to refuse to interfere in religious matters. The Emir replied that, if Ibn Saud coulc not be restrained with our help, the King and he would he bound eventually to take such steps as were necessary. No one was more anxious than himself that matters should be settled ami cab#, and he had even gone the length of suggesting that his brother Zeid should marry a girl of Ibn Saud 1 s family. ( It will be remembered that the King claimed this as his own idea at Jedda recently). 3. TREATY AND TRIBAL RIGHTS.- The Emir admitted that the three predecessors of Sherif Hussein had relaxed their hereditary control over the eastern tribes and said that one of the first acts of the latter, on assuming office, had been to write toto Ton Saud reclaiming the ancient rights of the Bherifs of Mecca to the control of all the Ateiha and all the Hard. Ibn Baud had naturally resented this and had done his best to keep the tribes with him. He had been unsuccessful and the matter had been legalised by the Treaty of 1910. The Emir laid great stress on this Treaty, which he claimed to be still in operation. The main points, he said, were Ibn Baud’s recognition of Sherif Hussein’s rights over the Ateiba and Qasim. Ibn Baud had agreed not to tax the Ateiba and that Qasim should pay a yearly contribution of £T 4,000 to the Meccan Treasury. The Emir admitted that the latter had never exacted any payment from Qasim, but claimed that his father had been content with Ibn Baud’s admission of Ms rights. If Ibn Baud would abide by this treaty, there would be no future trouble and he intended at an early date to ask his father to guarantee officially to the British Government the future independence of Ibn Saud and his descendants within the boundaries and under the conditions laid down in it. This guarantee His Majesty’s Government would be asked to convey to Ibn Baud. Colonel Wilson asked for a copy of the Treaty, which the Emir promised to obtain from Mecca. I pointed out to the Emir that the Ateiba were numerous in Nejd, that they held large stretches of grazing land and many wells and that it seemed hardly reasonable to expect that Ibn Baud would be content with an arrangement which might cause him a great deal of trouble and from which he would reap no benefit. The Emir replied that they would go to Ibn Saud on small matters but would have the right of ultimate appeal to the King. The distance between Nejd and Mecca would prevent this from being used too frequently. He foresaw(0) iK no difficulties; in his own phraseology, it would 'be 9S easy as drinking; a glaas of wa,ter, 4. THE ID R ISSI.- The Emir's attitude about the Idrissi was more sy mm the tic then one would have expected. He recounted at great length the history of the Ebhah campaign and concluded by saying that he had been sorry for Idrissi's downfall, for he had fought well against the Turks and his influence had been good. The Idrissi's present inactivity he attributed either to a secret understanding with the Turks, or lack of power, or jealousy of the King. He had made a great mistake at the beginning of the Arab revolt by not sending an Emissary to Mecca with an offer of co-operation. The King had been annoyed by this omission, and his suspicions of the Idrissi's intentions had led him to protest strongly when Idrissi troops occupied Kunfudah. The Emir thought that his father had made a mistake in this. At the present time, the Emir is reserving judgment. As soon as the situation permits, he intends to go to Mecca, study the whole question carefully with his father, and then probably move south with an army, at the same time inviting the co-operation of the Idrissi. This should put the sincerity of the latter to the nroof. The Emir said that he wished to re^instate the House of Ibn Aidh in Jebel Asir itself (i.e., over the tribes of Beni Mugheid, Beni Malik, Alqam el Hul and Rabia wa Rufeida) but he saw no reason why the Idrissi should not expand to Kunfudah and the hill districts to the east - providing the tribes would accept him. Similarly, he might extend his dominions south to include Hodeidah. Everything defended on himself. If he acknowledged thethe King as his overlord, and helped him whole-heartedly against the Turks, he would reap his reward. From what he knew of him, he thought his co-operation not unlikely, and he was inclined to regard him as the most hopeful instrument of future Arab unity. 5. THE IIviAM. - The Emir did not speak at great length about the Imam , but is evidently suspicious of his intentions. He said that when Medina had fallen, and he had realised that the Turks were in a hopeless case, the Imam would doubtless rise against them and establish himself in Sanaa. After that, he would probably try to win over the Sunni tribes and occupy Hodeidah. The Emir evidently has an eye on Yemen and said that he presumed that, since we had no treaty with the Imam, we would raise no objection to the King attacking him if he uroved intractable. He was afraid that the Turkish troops in Asir and Yemen might be allowed to remain in occupation after the end of the war, but was reassured by Colonel Wilson, on this point. (Signed) K. Cornwallis.

Cairo 6th January 1^18 j 13 C ■ / / Sir, I have the ho no uu to forward a note by Major Coinwallie of a recent conversation he had with ISmir Aba alia at wadi Ai a (near redim). This Emir is perhaps the cleverest and most influential of the bon&amp; of King Hussein, and his views on the question of the Caliphate are consequently of some importance. 1 agree with the observations made to the Emir by Major Cornwallis. 1 irect interference by us, or any Christians, in this question could only do harm. It nevertheless seems to me advisable to encourage the itnir's proposal to visit Cairo when the Hodjas Military situation permits, in order to have the opportunity of hearing further of ni a plane ^nd, if necessary, of checking premature or ill-considered action by him. I have forwarded copies of this despatch and note , . i i-Hii.nrniliuM lllMlllim 1 n ' 1 V‘ to India and Jeaopotaoia.

He asked me to say that h© felt strongly that the independence of the Arabs could never be fully established so long a© their spiritual head wac also the Sultan of Turkey. The Ottoman Government would always hold in its hands a powerful weapon which it would not scruple to use with effect, and if the Arab nation was to make anything of its future, it dust break clear from all shackling at the start. This necessarily involves the reversion of the Caliphate to its original home. His Father was on all counts the man most fitted, and his assumption of the office would bind the Arab Bstion together to a degree which was otherwise impossible. In particular the difference which at present existed between his Father and the important Smirs of the Arabian Peninsula could be solved without difficulty. I pointed out that the King had already told Colonel Wilson that he had no wish to become Caliph but the gmir replied that he would have no choice in the m atter Oust can decreed that the decision should be made for him by others and he would have no knowledge ol the pro jot't ur til the day on which h© was publicly proclaimed. I then reminded him that although it was the In f ia / traditional policy of His majesty’s Government rot to interfere in religious matters, tuch a step was bourp to have an effect on its millions of Mohammedan subjects •mich conic: not leave it unconcerned, anc I expressed the hope that he had no intention of taking any action without its full knowledge and approval. In this connection I instanced the trouble which had been caused last year when hie Father had assumed the Kingship without giving any previous warning. He fully reassured me on this point and admitted that little could be done without British sympathy and help and that any precipitate action would merely defeat its own end . He talked vaguely about waiting until two or three pilgrimages had passed, during which time rohammedan publl? opinion could gradually be prepared for the change. He claimed that there woulc be no difficulty in persuading the Arab peoples to accept it but ©eeamd to realise the opposition with which it might meet elsewhere. He refused to meet th© point that a Caliph who would be, f 01 the present at any rate, entirely dependent on a Christian Power for support, would find little sympathy with Moslems generally and implied that the monetary t,iffi- -eulty would be easily settled. I think that he lays great atore on the mineral resource# of the Hedjsi for he h&amp;e f —--— ■ - frequently referred to gold mines South of Taif to ^hich the Turks have never been allowed access and which he thljks are very valuable. The i fair gave me the impression that he was v^rymuch in earnest over this matter but I think that there is little danger of his taking any preoipit« te action which might eubarrase His SfaJaetyU Government at present.

Note prepared by Arab Bureau, Irak Section. ]. Abdul Aziz I bn Sand, the present Hakim of Najd, may be said to have begun his reign in 1901, when he was proclaimed Governor of Riyadh by his father, Abdul Rahman. 1 he Sa’ud family were at that time in exile, having been driven out of their dominions in 1891 by their hereditary foe, Ibn Rashid. In 1902, ’Abdul ’Aziz, with the help of Mubarak Ibn Sabah, Shaikh of Kuwait, recovered Riyadh in a daring raid which he led in peison, and b\ 190b he had so far re-established the old supremacy of the Sa ud as to carry hostilities to the gates of Hail. During the years succeeding his return to Riyadh he acted in close alliance with the Shaikh of Kuwait, who had every reason for desiring the curtailing of Rashid influence. For the Rashid were allies and, in a remote acceptation of the term, vassals of the Ottoman Empire, subsidised and backed by Constanti nople, and they represented in Arabia the Turkish policy of centralisation which the Shaikh was covertly resisting in his own territories. His geographical position on the shores of the Persian Gulf had placed him in relations with the British Government; since 1899 we had had a friendly understanding with him, and had promised to support him against Ottoman aggression. But the existence- of this connection made us unwilling to see him drawn into the confused and uncertain feuds of the interior; and acting on the principle laid down in 1897 that we were “ not disposed to interfere more than was necessary for the maintenance “ of general peace in the Persian Gulf,” we had discouraged him from embroiling himself in Central Arabian affairs. Ibn Sa’ud, in spite of his growing importance, was outside the limits of our interest, thus appointed, and it was not until 1911 that special attention was drawn to him in our official reports. In that year Captain Shakespear, the Political Agent at Kuwait, while on tour, met him by chance in the desert and was hospitably entertained in his camp. Ibn Sa’ud expressed to him a desire to be received into a recognised relationship with Great Britain ; he referred to Colonel Pelly’s visit to Riyadh in 1865, and to the overtures made to us by his father, ’Abdul Rahman, in 1904, when a British Agent was first appointed to Kuwait. He spoke in strong terms of the hatred which the Arabs entertained for the Turks and of his own resentment of their occupation of the Hasa, a • province which he was particularly anxious to regain, not only because it formed part of his ancestral dominions, but also because it would give him access to the sea and control over the tribes from Riyadh to the coast. He regarded with grave apprehension the aggressive policy of the new regime in Turkey, and would welcome, if he recovered the Hasa, a British Agent in 'n one of his ports ; and he added that our trade would benefit froiigthe increased J security which he would maintain on the caravan routes. Captain ^ Shakespear could make no other rejoinder than that the British Government confined its interests to the coast, and had never challenged Turkish claims to the ordering of affairs in Central Arabia, with which we had no concern ; that we were, moreover, on amicable terms with. Turkey and should be averse from anything in the nature of intrigue against the Ottoman Govern ment ; but in his comments on the report of this interview, Sir Percy Cox pointed out that as the Porte seemed disposed to be intractable in the adjustment of matters relating to British interests in the Gulf, we could not afford to ignore Ibn Sa’ud’s attitude. His personal authority had greatly increased and it would be well to entertain cordial if distant relations with him. The Foreign Office, however, decided that it was impossible at that time to swerve from our policy of strict non-interference. 2. Two years later Ibn Sa’ud, without the assistance which he had tried to obtain from us, though he was credited throughout Arabia with having S i HO 2/18 Asecured it, overran the Hasa, ejected without difficulty the small luikish garrisons and established himself on the coast at Qatif and Ojair. Captain Shakespear, on his return to England in June 1914 from a long projected journey across Arabia, in the course of which he had visited Riyadh, bore witness to the strong personal domination which Ibn Sa ud s vigorous and commanding personality had established, and from other reports it was clear that lie was regarded beyond iiis own frontiers as the coming man. He proved more than a match for the ineffective efforts of the Turks to retake the Hasa: they resorted to diplomacy and opened negotiations with him . through Saiykf Talib of Basrah. Early in May Tal at Beg had formulated in private conversation at the British Embassy the expectations of the Ottoman Government in terms which seemed to his -hearers little consonant with actual conditions. He proposed to establish a strictly delimited frontier between Ibn Sa’ud and Ibn Rashid, place representatives of the Sultan at Riyadh and at Hail, and rely upon the guile of these officials to control without the aid of force the actions of the two Amirs. As for the Hasa, Ibn Sa’ud would be appointed Mutasarrif of the province, but the collection of the Customs would remain in Turkish hands and Turkish garrisons would be replaced in the ports. 3. Nothing was more certain than that Ibn Sa’ud’s appearance on the coast must ultimately bring him into direct contact with ourselves, whether we welcomed it or sought to avoid it ; and this anxiety underlay and possibly accelerated the action of the Porte. But at the moment lurkish fears were groundless. We were concerned wholly with the conclusion of prolonged negotiations with Constantinople, touching interests in Mesopotamia and the Gulf which were of vital importance, and were less inclined, if possible, than before for Arabian adventure. We made a friendly offer of mediation which was refused, and when in April 1914 the Amir met the British Agent, Colonel Grey, outside Kuwait, he was given to understand that we had recently concluded a comprehensive agreement with Turkey and could hold out to him no hope of support. Ibn Sa’ud was thrown back on his own resources, but these were considerable, and the secret treaty which was signed in May by himself and the Wali of Basrah fell short of Tal’at Beg’s anticipations. He accepted the title of Wali and Military Commandant of Najd which was offered to himself and his descendants as long as they should remain loyal, and engaged to fly the Turkish flag, but he was to have charge of the Customs on behalf of the Ottoman Government, raise his own levies and provide the garrisons’ for Qatif and Ojair. Deficiencies in the .Najd budget were to be met from the Customs, and no revenue from any local income w T as to be paid to Constantinople until such time as there was • a surplus, an eventuality of doubtful occurrence. But while exercising in his own territories an authority which was in all but the name that of an inde pendent ruler, his correspondence with foreign Powers w 7 as to be conducted solely through the Porte, and in case of war he was to come to the assistance of the Sultan. 4. What would have been the upshot of a treaty which so imperfectly reflected the convictions of the contracting parties can scarcely admit of doubt. The guiding trait of Ibn Sa’ud’s character is what must be called a racial rather than a national patriotism, but this sentiment was not likely to evoke sympathetic consideration from the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, who were blindly determined on the Ottomanization of the Arabs. As a strict Wahabi, the new Wali of Najd looked with abhorrence on the loose religious principles of the Turks and was far from admitting their pretensions to represent and direct Islam. He had, in conversation with Captain Shakespear, spoken with unexpected vehemence on this point, saying that in Ids eyes the Infidel was preferable to the Turk, since the latter broke the rule he professed to follow while the former acted in accordance with his own law : and to the same listener he declared that he had accepted the terms of the agreement only because he was assured privately that even the small measure of sovereignty accorded to Turkey would never be Maimed. The Kuwait treaty was put to the test by the outbreak of European war and found wanting.Avar 5. 1 lie disquieting attitude adopted by Turkey on the outbreak of between Germany and the Entente Powers produced a profound alteration m our policy towards the Porte. It became necessary to reckon up our assets m Arabia and early in October Captain Shakespear, who was in England was ordered to return to the Persian Gulf and get into touch with ibn ba ud, so as to prevent, if possible, the outbreak of unrest in the interior ami m the event of war with Turkey to ensure that no assistance should be rendered from that quarter. Before he could reach his destination war hnd been declared A message had been despatched to Ibn Sa’ud informing him of Captain bhakespear s impending visit, recognising his position in \ T aid and the Hasa and guaranteeing him against reprisals by sea or land if he would commit himself to enter the lists against Turkey. The Turks on their side, lost^io time in approaching the Amirs of Central Arabia. Their scheme, which was that Ibn Rashid should aid in the campaign ao-ainst Egypt while Ibn Sa’ud opposed the British advance in Mesopotamia, showed that they were as unaware of the feeling toward them which prevailed among the Arabs as they were ignorant of the conditions - of the desert, where the network of tiibal feud permits no nian to withdraw his forces on a distant expedition without fear of attack on his uuprotected possessions. Ibn Sa’ud, apparently in order to gain time, took advantage of his abiding enmity with Ibn Rashid and launched into open hostilities against him. In vain Enver Pasha urged him to abandon private quarrels, sent him a gift of money for the expenses of co-operation and ultimately entrusted Saiyid Talib with the reconciliation. At this juncture. Saiyid Talib endeavouring, through the intermediation of Majesty’s Consul at Muhammarah, to drive a Government providing for his adherence to us Turkey, but the terms which he put forward were so impossible of acceptance, and he was still hesitating over extravagant with the Sultan’s armies, task of bringing about a was busily engaged in Shaikh Khaz’al and His bargain with the British in the event of war with as to be Shaikh Khaz’al’s advice to him to abate them when the declaration of war left him stranded. Then it was that he saw in his proposed deputation to Najd a providential means of escape from Basrah, where his position had now become highly precarious, and he left hurriedly, for Ibn Sa’ud’s camp, via Zubair. Mean while the Wahabi Chief, in response to Turkish exhortation, had pleaded that he could spare no troops for the ’Iraq till he had reduced Ibn Rashid to^ his rightful state of vassalage. To the British message he replied that he was unshaken in his long-standing desire for intimate relations with us. But lie was not unnaturally reluctant to take open part with us until he was satisfied that our change of front towards himself was likely to be permanent, and in spite of his personal confidence in Captain Shakespear it was with some misgiving that he consented to his visit. The meeting took place on 31st December at Khufsah, near Majina’, in Sudair. Ibn Sa’ud spoke with great frankness. Before compromising himself wholly with the Turks he asked that our assurances of support should be embodied in a formal treaty, the terms of which were drafted forthwith. They included a guarantee of complete independence on our part and an undertaking on the part of Ibn Sa’ud that he would have no dealings with other Powers except after reference to the British Government. He informed Captain Shakespear that he had been in communication with the Sharif and with the heads of the northern ’Anazah confederation, and that they were resolved to stand together. He was holding in detention a party of four envoys sent by the Turks to urge him to join Ibn Rashid in a Jihad against us, but after consultation with Captain Shakespear the Turkish mission was dismissed with the reply that Ibn Rashid’s forces were camped within two days of Ibn Sa’ud and that there could now be no question of peace between them. On 17th January a messenger arrived from Mecca bearing a letter from the Sharif’s son ’Abdullah, who wrote that the Sharif had been called upon to proclaim the Jihad and was temporising till he heard what line Ibn Sa’ud proposed to take. . Ibn Sa’ud made answer that he saw no advantage to the Arabs in joining the Ottoman Government and had himself dismissed a Turkish deputation empty-handed. 6 . Upon the reports sent by Captain Shakespear from Ibn Sa’ud’s camp, Sir Percy Cox was authorised to proceed with the negotiations for the treaty.•but on ^ 4 tli January battle was. joined between Ibn Sa’ud and Ibn Rashid, and Captain Shakespear, unarmed and present only as a spectator, met Ins death. Ibn Sa nd s version of the disaster was that he vwis shot dead by a Shammar rifle-bullet, but this statement is in any case based only on second hand information, as it is undisputed that Captain Suakespeai had taken up a position in a different part of the field from that where his host was located. ' Since then various and divergent accounts of what happened have been recited, one of little more value than another, but the balance of evidence goes to show that he was first wounded in the leg and disabled, and soon 'afterwards killed in the charge of Ibn Rashid’s cavalry, which, overwhelmed the flank on which he was posted. In the sauve qui pent which ensued it is feared that he was either abandoned or # forgotten, but the precise circumstances of his untimely death will probably never be ascertained. Ibn Sa’ud expressed profound icgiet foi the loss of ^.OiieS* whom he regarded as a brother, anil always lefeis to mm \\ ith icspect and affection. 7 . The action was indecisive : both parties claimed the victory, and both were tempoiarily crippled and forced to retire.- It was an unexpected and a somewhat disconcerting result, for Ibn Sa’ud's preparations had been made on an exceptional scale and his forces were said largely to outnumber those of Ibn Rashid, though he was inferior in cavalry. The accounts given by the Arabs attribute his defeat to the treachery of the ’Ajman. ^ Ibn Sa’ud’s personal courage is beyond question, but he not uncommonly falls short as a tactician, and Mubarak of Kuwait pronounced him to be a poor leader in battle. But if he had not dealt Ibn Rashid a crushing blow he had at least put him out of action and prevented him from joining the Turks, as he unquestionably would have done. The intervention of Ibn Rashid in the early part of the Mesopotamian campaign might have added considerably to our difficulties. Nevertheless, Captain Shakespear’s death was a heavy price to pay for the advantage of immobilising him. 8 . The two Chiefs held apart without further hostilities till the summer, when an agreement dated 10 th June was concluded between them. Ibn Rashid recognised Ibn Sa’ud’s claims, except that of overlordship, which he ' could scarcely be expected to acknowledge, and undertook not to play a treacherous game towards the Turkish Government, but to incline towards whichever Government was in alliance with Ibn Sa’ud. He confined his own jurisdiction to Hail and its villages and the Shammar tribes, while Ibn Sa’ud was acknowledged to hold all Najd from Al Khahaf to Dawasir. A1 Khahaf is no doubt the Kahafah of Hunter’s map, a little north of latitude 27°. In a tribal country the adjustment-of frontiers can never be very exact, but it is clear that Ibn Rashid renounced all pretensions to the Qasim, a province whose rich oases had frequently changed hands. It is of interest to note that the tribes reckoned as subject to Ibn Sa’ud are the Mutair, ’Ataibah, Harb, Bani ’Abdullah, ’Ajman, Murrah, Manasir, Bani Hajar, Subai’, Sahul, Qantan and Dawasir ; but this catalogue must not be taken as exact, for the Mutair are mostly in Kuwait territory, and the ’Ataiban and Harb come for the greater part under the Sharif. 9. After Captain Shakespear’s death Ibn Sa’ud sent an immediate request that another officer should be accredited to him, or, failing this, that negotiations should continue through his agent in Basrah, ’Abdul Latif Mandil. No suitable officer was available, but Ibn Sa’ud was advised to sign a preliminary agreement on the lines of Captain Shakespear’s draft and leave all details to be settled later. He signed and returned the new draft which had been sent to him, but with some important modifications, con cerning which it seemed better to postpone further discussion till a meeting with the Chief Political Officer could be arranged. For the time, therefore, the conclusion of the treaty was suspended, Ibn Sa’ud being wholly engaged with internal affairs. His position at home at this epoch was the reverse of secure. His reputation among the tribes had suffered from the unsuccessful operations against Ibn Rashid, during which he had incurred much loss in material and equipments, and during the greater part of 1915 he was engaged with a dangerous rising in the Hasa on the part of the ’Ajman.5 He himself believed that the revolt was instigated by the Turks and Ibn Rashid, but it is doubtful whether his view was correct. Mubarak of Kuwait was convinced that there was no evidence to support it, but Mubarak, during the last few years of his reign, was not a lenient critic of Ibn Sa’ud’s difficulties. 10. His opinion is so far borne out that the troubles with the ’Ajman seem to have begun with the occupation of the Hasa by the Amir in 1913. Up to that time the tribe had been on good terms with him and had generally recognised him as suzerain, but the extension of his direct authority to the Hasa, which is their headquarters, had strained their allegiance. He attempted to impose a poll tax upon them and stopped them from taking dues from caravans passing through the country, a toll which they had been accustomed to exact in the days of the Turks. The discontent of the ’Ajman was fanned by members of Ibn Sa’ud’s family who had long been at enmity with him—the ’Araif, grandsons of his uncle Sa’ud. Two of the ’Araif cousins, Fahad Ibn Sa’ud and Salman Ibn Muhammad, had taken refuge with the Shaikh of Bahrein. The Shaikh made a half-hearted attempt to patch up a reconciliation in 1914, but the ’Araif refused his mediation and sought the protection of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, from whom they received some countenance when hostilities were renewed with Ibn Sa’ud in 1915. The rebellion now assumed serious proportions. Ibn Sa’ud sent for more troops from Riyadh and asked help from Kuwait, but before the arrival of either reinforcement he attacked the ’Ajman by night near Hofuf and met with a reverse, due partly to the cowardice of the Hofuf town levies. 'His brother Sa’ud was killed and he himself wounded. For a time his fortunes were at a very low ebb. He was in want of money and arms, and for all practical purposes was besieged in Hofuf. Ibn Rashid, oblivious of the agreement recently signed, seized the opportunity to raid the Qasim, but his advance was easily stopped, and the arrival of a force- from Kuwait under the Shaikh’s son, Salim, turned the balance in the Hasa. The ’Ajman were routed in September, harried on their retreat northwards by the Bani Khalicl, and forced to take refuge in Kuwait territory, where they remained until Shaikh. Mubarak’s death in December. Fahad Ibn Sa’ud was killed in the retreat: Salman made bis peace with Ibn Sa’ud at the end of the year. During the struggle we had facilitated the despatch of ammunition to Ibn Sa’ud from Bahrein, and done what we could to restrain Abu Dhabi. In October we presented Ibn Sa’ud with 1,000 rifles,-and gave him a loan of 2O,000Z. The Turks had not yet abandoned all hope of winning him over, and in July, previous to Ibn Rashid’s raid, a Turkish emissary, Salih al Sharif al Hasni, communicated with him and proposed a meeting ; but his request was refused, and on 26th December Ibn Sa’ud met Sir Percy Cox at Qatif, and the long-delayed treaty was completed and signed. Subject to certain safeguards, it provided Ibn Sa’ud with a dynastic guarantee in the dominions now in his possession, and promised him the support of Great Britain in case of unprovoked aggression from foreign Powers. On his side, Ibn Sa ud engaged to hold no correspondence with any foreign Power, and to grant no concessions to foreigners; to keep open the roads to the Holy Places, and to commit no aggressive act on other Shaikhs under our protection. 11. Ibn Sa’ud was unaware of the exceedingly confidential correspondence which we had been carrying on with the Sharif during the winter of 1915-16, but the results to which it led could not leave him indifferent. Relations between the Hijaz and Najd had been dictated by conflicting sentiments. The Sharif had even more reason than Ibn Sa’ud to fear the Tmks, but he was jealous of Ibn Sa’ud’s position as an Arab Chief, and the feeling was reciprocated in Riyadh. The fluctuating allegiance of the tribes is a rich source of discord in Arabia, and the absence of any defined frontiers enhances the uncertainty of claims and obligations. In 1310 the bhant ’Abdullah, asserting that he acted on behalf of the Ottoman Government^ marched to the borders of the Qasim for the purpose of reasserting an authority which was probably a thing of the past and must at the best have been shadowy. The tangible results of the raid do not*seem to have beenG more than a re-insistence on the Sharif s suzerainty over the distant sections of the ’Ataibah. a tribe which had once been under Ibn Sa rid, but had largely seceded to the Sharif. A small tribute to Mecca from the Qasim villages was stipulated for by Abdullah before his withdrawal, but it is unlikely that it was ever paid. From 1913 the Sharif showed strong _ anti -1 urkish pro clivities, and before the outbreak of war he and Ibn Sa ud diew togethei. Thev were in correspondence when Captain bhakespear paid ms hist visit to Riyadh in the spring of 1914. In January 1915 they were acting m concert •md Ibn Sa’ud told Captain Shakespear that m his view the ivhalitate would revert to the family of the Prophet, of which the Sharif was the representa tive if it dropped from the hand of the Sultan of Turkey. In November 1915 ’Abdullah reappeared in Najd, with what object is not very clear ills own explanation was that he was sent on a mission to Ibn band, with the further purpose of collecting dues m the Qasim and Sudair Except for a doubtful suzerainty over wandering sections of the Ataibah, the bhanf does not seem in Beduin estimation to have rights in either pro mice* his limits eastwards being somewhere between Long. 44 and Long. 4o , at bha arah, Duwadmi, Jabal Bhurai and Jabal al Kir. ’Abdullah is not reported to have advanced much beyond Sha’arah; he collected dues from the Ataibah subdued the small allied section of the Buraih (by origin Mutair) and returned to the Hijaz ; but Ibn Sa’ud, barely emerged 4'rom a perilous contest in the Hasa, not unreasonably regarded the expedition as inopportune and even suspicious. (These sentiments were reflected in his conversations with Sir Percv Cox in December. He reminded the Chief Political Officer that the Wahabis recognised no Khalif after the first four, and was careful to add that if the Sharif should assume the title it would make no difference to his status among other ruling Chiefs.) In June of the following year the Sharif rose in open rebellion against the Turks and declared the independence of the Arabs. Ibn Sa’ud, writing in July to the Chief Political Officer, acknowledged’ the receipt from him of official news with regard to the Hijaz, expressed his satisfaction at the discomfiture of the Turks, but put forward bis own apprehensions that the Sharif might proceed to claim authoiity ovei parts of Najd, and in support of this fear observed that in declaring the independence of “the Arabs” the Sharif appeared to treat them as a compendious whole, an attitude which he regarded with anxiety. 12. In August he wrote again, saying that he had now received a letter from the Sharif in which the latter announced the occupation of Mecca and asked him for his help. Ibn Sa’ud gave a summary of his reply, and a copy of the original letter has since been received. He assured the Sharif that he would render all assistance which was in his power, but asked for a written under taking that the Sharif would abstain from trespassing in his territory or interfering with his subjects. Ibn Sa’ud ’went on to ask Sir Percy Cox whether his relations with the Sharif might be regarded as a matter which affected the two chiefs alone, or whether they touched on our interests, in which case he would be guided by our wishes. According to Arah reports received at Kuwait the Sharif wrote three times to Ibn Sa’ud asking for aid, and on two occasions sent him 2,000Z. Not improbably there is some truth in the rumoured remittance of small sums. 13. The Sharif’s answer, dated 5th September, to Ibn Sa’ud’s letter was, to say the least of it, uneonciliatory, and aroused bis lively indignation. His letter and the draft undertaking which had been sent with it for the Sharif’s acceptance were sent back with the observation that Ibn Sa’ud’s request could emanate only from a man bereft of reason. About the same time Ibn Sa’ud received a letter from ’All Haidar acquainting him with his appointment as Sharif in place of Husain by the Ottoman Government, and calling on him to join the Jihad ; but in his reply Ibn Sa’ud expressed the resentment felt by the Arabs towards him and towards the Turks. 14. The Chief Political Officer dealt at length with the Hijaz question in a letter to Ibn Sa’ud dated 19th October. He -pointed out how important it was to the Arab cause, which it was the policy of the British Government to support, that all the great Arab Chiefs should work together and incoopeiation witli ns m tlie coininoii task of oxpellnio - tiie Turks from Arabia As to I bn k&gt;a ml s o\\ 11 position, lie need Lave no misgivings, for lie had been acknowledged by us to be-an independent ruler, and the Sharif must recognise the full import of the treaty. The British Govermuent had no reason to believe that he entertained any hostile intentions against the tribes and territories of Najd. 15. In the negotiation over the treaty in December 1915, Sir Percy Cox had discussed with fbn Sa’ud the possibility of his giving us assistance against Ibn Rashid. The Hakim of Najd then thought that Ibn Rashid would either come in or maintain a strict neutrality; if, however, he showed himself actively hostile, Ibn Sa’ud would attack him and incite the northern ’Anazah against him. This intention, however, he failed to carry out. During the spring and summer of 191(5 he was occupied with a rebellion of the Murrah, following on, and perhaps connected with, that of the ’Ajman, which endangered his communications with the Hasa. Though a large proportion of the lighting men of the Shammar had gone north with Ibn Rashid against the ’Iraq, no effective attack was made on Hail in their absence. In late June or early July, Ibn Sa’ud’s son, Turki, raided Jabal Shammar, and the news may have hastened Ibn Rashid’s retreat from our frontiers. In September or October Turki renewed hostilities against some of the Shammar Shaikhs and an allied section of the Harb, but the affair resulted only in the capture of a small amount of booty, and Ibn Sa’ud’s doctor, passing through Bahrein, brought a message to the effect that the Amir could do nothing against the Shammar as long as the fugitive ’Ajman remained on his Hank. The true reason for his inactivity was no doubt his own insecurity at home, but the* implacable hostility which he entertained toward the ’Ajman, whom he regarded not only as rebels, but as the murderers of his brother Sa’ud, threatened to become a problem of some difficulty. 10. When Shaikh Mubarak died in December 1915, Ibn Sa’ud pressed his son and successor in Kuwait, Jabir, to drive out the ’Ajman Shaikhs. Jabir made a temperate reply. He was unwilling to eject the ’Ajman, fearing that they would be thrown into the enemy camp ; but he could not hold out against Ibn Sa’ud’s insistence without creating an open breach, and he expelled the tribe in February 1910. As he anticipated, they turned for protection first to ’Ajaimi and then to Ibn Rashid, but in May they asked and obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair -to settle quietly near Safwan, and subsequently several of the leading Shaikhs made submission to us. When Ibn Rashid returned to Hail only two of the ’Ajman Shaikhs remained with ’Ajaimi and they had little or no following. Ibn Sa’ud’s ardent desire to direct his energies upon the extermination of this tribe was not one with which we had any sympathy, at all events at the present j uncture. 17. Shaikh Jabir, new to his office, could not hope to exercise the influence over Ibn Sa’ud which had been possessed by that practised and ^ weighty diplomatist, his father ; moreover, for some years before Mubarak’s death, relations between Riyadh and Kuwait had been growing cooler. Ibn Sa’ud bitterly resented Mubarak’s attitude during the negotiations between himself and the Ottoman Government in the spring of 1914. According to his account, the Shaikh had at first counselled him to accept the Turkish offers ; but when he reached Kuwait in April, Mubarak changed his note without exnianation and advised Ibn Sa ud not to come to teims with ihe links, refusing at the same time to be present at his meeting with the delegates. So indignant was the Amir that he expressly stipulated with Captain Shakespear that Mubarak should not be consulted in the negotiations with ourselves. The asylum given to the’Ajman was another grievance, and in 1916 Ibn Sa’ud complained of the incidence of the transit dues which had been, from time immemorial, levied in Kuwait. IS While Ibu Sa’ud’s anxiety as to the ambitions^of the Sharif and his grow in estrangement with Kuwait showed that the chiefs allied with ourselves had not reached a satisfactory understanding with each other,8 there was evidence that the Lurks were still active in Aialiia. hews was received from Ibn Sa’ud and from other sources of the despatch of an agent (Muhammad Taufiq ibn Faraun of Damascus) for the purpose of buying- camels for the Ottoman Government; the emissary was well chosen, for he was a personal friend of Ibn Sa’ud and had visited Najd on the same business the previous year. But on this occasion the Amir was pressed by us to prevent him from obtaining camels ; he- accordingly arrested Ibn Fara’un, confiscated 700 camels which had been purchased in the interior, and sent them to Kuwait. Various reports, some of which came from Ibn Sa’ud indicated that another attempt to stir up Ibn Rashid against us was in the wind. Rushaid Ibn Lailah, Ibn Rashid’s representative at Con stantinople, joined him at Hail, with a few German and Turkish officers, a small body of Turkish soldiers, and some guns-; accounts varied as to the exact composition of the mission, but its presence m Hail in some form seemed fairly certain. Ibn Sa’ud had written in September that he would be glad of a personal interview with the Chief Political Officer to discuss the question of co-operation with the Sharif or offensive action against Ibn Rashid. In October he repeated the request urgently, and on all grounds it seemed advisable to accede to it. Sir Percy Cox met him at Ojair on 11th November. Ibn Sa’ud explained to him his position in detail. He had lost considerably in men and material in the fight with Ibn Rashid in January 1915. Since then he had been almost continuously in the field, first against the ’Ajman and then against the Murrah. Most of the normal trade of Najd was with Syria, and the tribes were accustomed to sell their camels to Damascene dealers the strict blockade imposed by Ibn Sa’ud—the seizure of Ibn Fara’un’s camels bore witness to its reality—grew more and more galling ; the Najdis grumbled, the tribes were restless, all asked wherein lay the advantage to themselves of their Chief’s attitude, and it was increasingly difficult for him to keep them in hand. With regard to the Sharif, Sir Percy Cox was able to give Ibn Sa’ud the fullest reassurance. Our treaty with the Amir had been communicated to Mecca, and when the Sharif announced to us his intention of proclaiming himself King of the Arabs on 5th November, we had insisted on a formal admission that he claimed no jurisdiction over independent rulers. The news of the coronation at Mecca had not yet reached Central Arabia, and was not discussed. During conversation with the Chief Political Officer at Basrah, Ibn Sa’ud made a passing remark about the Sharif’s calling himself ‘‘ Sultan,” but his mind seemed to be set completely at rest on hearing that his rights were safeguarded by us, and that the Sharif had explicitly denied any design on the independence of himself or his com peers. 19. Ibn Sa’ud having expressed to the Chief Political Officer at their meet- . ing at Ojair his inclination to pay a brief visit to Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait before returning home, the project was cordially encouraged as appearing eminently expedient, and Sir Percy Cox recommended that he should be presented with the K.C.l.E. at a Majlis which was to be held at Kuwait where the Shaikh was to be invested with the C.S.I. When he intimated to Ibn Sa’ud that this honour was to be accorded to him, the Chief Political Officer was authorised to inform at the same time that his rights had been carefully reserved in all dealings which the British Government had held with the Sharif, and Ibn Sa’ud in his reply said that he was entirely satisfied on this point. 20. The Majlis took place on 20th November. The Shaikh of Muhammarah had come to Kuwait for the occasion, and many Beduin were present, including the friendly headmen of the Shammar Aslam and Dhatir, and Shaikhs of the Mutair. The Chief Political Officer, in presenting the decorations, alluded to our satisfaction in feeling that the great Arab chiefs were bent with us upon a common purpose. The Shaikh of Muhammarah followed him with words which were vrarmly pro-British, and Ibn Sa’ud struck the keynote of the meeting in a speech which was as spontaneous as it was unexpected. He said that the Turks had placed themselves outsidetli t pale of Islam by the iniquities which they had committed on other Moslems. He contrasted their policy with that of Great Britain coin , ' out that the lurks had sought to weaken the Arabs by foinenting ei? differences, whereas the British Government encouraged them to ufite Th their own interest. He praised the action of the Sharif, and urged the obhgation of &lt;ill true Arabs to co-operate with him in forwarding the Arab c 1 a ! ls t e - , lle ! 1 lad bl 'onght ms speech to an eloquent close the three chiefs, huwait, Muhammarah, and Ibn Sa’ud, swore together that they would work. with, us ioi tliG EchiGVGrncnt cf n conimon end. -o 1 2L ^ 1 llls 1 s 1 cenemade a deep impression on the local notables and on the if dmn bnaikns present, wdio will, no doubt, carry the tale far and wide During the receptions at Kuwait, Ibn Sa’ud showed in all his utterances how clearly he had grasped the principle which guides our relations with Arabia. Me quoted as an example of our benevolent policy towards the Arab cause the fact that we were ready even to promote a reconciliation between himself and Ibn Has bid if the lattei v r ould abandon his attitude of hostility. IThe arrival of Ibn I ara’ud’s 700 line camels, each branded with the wasm of that well-lmowm dealer, gave a dramatic completeness to the Kuwait gathering. From Kuwait Ibn Sa’ud went to Muhammarah as the guest of Shaikh Khaz’al, who co-operated most heartily in the endeavour to make Ibn Sa’ud’s visit profitable to him. The two chiefs arrived at Basrah on the evening of 26th November. Early next morning the Chief Political Officer, accom panied by the two chief military representatives of the Army Commander present in Basrah, went on board the Shaikh’s launch and presented Ibn Sa ud vdth a sword of honour and a message of welcome from the Army Commander. The day was spent in exhibiting to him the base camps and organisation and the latest machinery of vmrfare, including the aircraft, in which he took an eager interest. Dhari ibn Twalah and Humud al Suwait, Shaikhs of the Shammar A slam and the Dhahr, were present, while Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair and several Sunni notables of Basrah and refugees from Baghdad had an audience with Ibn Sa’ud on the launch. 23. The Kuwait Durbar and Ibn Sa’ud’s visit to Basrah have placed us in a singularly strong position. Three powerful chiefs have made public protes tation of their friendship wdth each other and their confidence in the British Government. A telegram received from the Sharif, congratulating them upon their zeal in the Arab cause and regretting that he had not had time to send a representative to Kivwait, confirmed the identity of his aims with their ow r n, and in a further rtiessage he apologised for any deficiencies in his previous letters, on the ground that wdiile he was in the throes of war he might unintentionally fall short as a correspondent. The dream of Arab unity which engaged the imagination of the Liberals qf Damascus during the year before the wnar has been brought nearer fulfilment than dreams are wont to come, but the role of presiding genius has been recast. Instead of the brilliant, unscrupulous Saiyid Talib, gyrating in the blast of bis own ambition, the Chiefs of Eastern and Western Arabia have united at the instance of the British Government. 24. Besides this knitting together of Arab leaders, the meeting at Kuwait has produced certain immediate results. In the first place the extent and nature of Ibn Sa’ud’s share in future hostilities with Ibn Rashid, if such should occur, were agreed upon. He undertook to maintain 4,000 men under arms ; if Ibn Rashid moved in force towards the ’Iraq, he would move up parallel with him towards Zubair and join the friendly tribes and a contingent from Kuwait. He informed the friendly Shaikhs that he would support them if Ibn Rashid threatened to attack them in strength. If, however, Ibn Rashid should remain at Hail, Ibn Sa’ud would harass and attack him as opportunity offered, using the Qasim as a base. In view of the strain upon bis resources during the last two years, he has been given 3,000 rifles with ammunition, as well as four machine-guns, and granted a monthly subsidy of 5 , 000 k to cover the expenses he will incur in maintaining10 Ms ,eu in ^ f eld. l“to Meet ala Sign olgoodwill, if the Sharif would ..ake a special request for tliem. a \^r Thn Su’ucl in tbe name of the three 25.

These have been sent through a man iiom Ta-iad Beg’s t^ts who was in Basrah at the time of Ibn Sa’ud’s visit and went to see him at Muhammarah, where he received advice and instructions from Shaikh Khaz’al in full measure. He was entrusted also with letters from the Sharif which have been waiting opportunity of despatch to TahadBeg, Hachim al Muhaid, ’AH Sulainum of the Dulaim and others, and with presents in money to guide Fahad Beg’s decision and to encourage the amicable disposition of the Shaikh of the Dahamshah, Jaza ibn ilijlad Gommunications of the same nature are on their way to Atiyah ai Qulal ot Hajaf and Muhammad ’Ali Kamunah of Karbala. Basra, .12th January 1917The history of modern Arabia has been determined by two main factors; the rise and growth of the Vfahabi power in Nejd and the attempts made by the Turks to enforce their dominion over deserts where the suzerainty of an exterior or centralised government has never been permanent. Between 1784 and 1804, under Ibn Saud^ ancestor Abdul Aziz, the Wahabis pillaged Iraq and Kerbela, exacted tribute from Bahrain, threatened Oman, captured and purged Mecca, and pillaged Medina driving out the Turkish representative. The sacking of Hodeida in the South was the furthest extension of the Wahabi power, but in 1810 a Wahabi army ravaged the Hauran and all but reached Damascus, whilst Saud*s son, Abdul, raided almost to Baghdad. The Turks then turned to the Khedivial family for assistancs and the Wahabi conquests were checked by a series of expeditions from Egypt led either by Mohammed All himself or his sons Tahsin and Ibrahim Pasha. However, in 1817 Ibrahim over-ran Qasim and in 1818 the Wahabi Emir Abdullah bin Saud was sent a prisoner to Constantinople where he was beheaded. Wahabi authority was established at Riyadh in 1845, but in 1871 Turkish troops reoccupied Hasa and Abdulla bin Feisal ibn Saud accepted the title of Qaimmaqam of Nejd. In 1835 the Rashid family at Hail rose to prominence. Dissension between Hail and Riyadh commenced in 1877 leading £o the seizure by Mohammed Ibn Rashid of Qasim in 1882 and iyadh in 1887. Until his death in 1897 he remained in ^absolute possession of Central Arabia, encouraged by the Porte who have invariably maintained the policy of assisting the Rashid family as a means of maintaining touch with the interior of Arabia. In 1914In 1914 the present Ibn Baud, aided by the Sheikh of Koweit, returned to Riyadh and recovered Qasim, expelling the Turkish garrisons. The dissension and distrust which undoubtedly exist between the Sherif and Ibn Baud are thus probably due to traditional and more deep seated causes than appear on the face of matters • To the Puritan Wahabi the Sherif is only a powerful ruler of Bedouin and the growth of his power a matter for jealousy. That the Khedivial family should side with Ibn Rashid and the Turks against the Wahabis appears consistent, the only inconsistency being the action of the Sherif who has close family connections with Egypt. As between Hussein and Baud, the choice for our military policy is simple, and our greater effort must be to support the Sherif who has demobilised Turkish troops and turned the Hejaz Railway from a strategic advantage into a positive encumbrance to the Turks, Ibn Baud, on the other hand, has secured us little definite military advantage beyond the moral influence of his alliance. It is not really likely that he intends seriously to despatch forces to the n ejaz Railway, nor that the Sherif would welcome them should he do so. It is open for him to take Hail should he choose to, though we should not exaggerate the effect of such an operation on the Turkish cause, as any Turkish garrison which may remain there is so small as to be negligible, and after losing Teima Ibn Rashid is unlikely to be able to return to his capital with any prestige. Ibn Baud appears to exaggerate grossly the resources of Ibn Rashid and lays himself open to the suspicion of doing so as the means of securing military material and assistance for his orivate ends. The armed strength of Jebel Shammar was e s timat euestimated in 1378 at between 3,500 and 11,000. When Ibn Rashid came up to Mesopotamia in June 1913 he had only 600 men with him, and when he arrived at Medain Saleh in August he had only 1,000 men, the men of Rail refusing to accompany him owing to his defeat at Teima. He is looked on as a broken reed by the Turks and recently Fakhri Pasha, the Turkish Commander at Medina, strongly opposed an attempt to assist him in recovering Teima, while Jemal Pasha thought he should still be assisted on account of past services rather than on account of the present or future attitude of his v tribes. He is at present virtually a prisoner with:,the Turks at Medain Saleh, while his followers are deserting. Therefore, Ibn Saud*s estirrated requirements for operations against Hail seem altogether disproportionate, and Mr. Philby and Colonel Cunliffe Owen in supporting them seem either to be carried away by their local surroundings or gulled completely by the Wahabi Emir,who is doubtless as well informed as we are regarding the true condition of Ibn Rashid. The decision already made - that it will suffice for the present if Sir P. Cox doles out money to Ibn Saud at discretion - seems to satisfy the present situation if not all parties concerned, and this policy is endorsed by G.O.C. Baghdad in his telegram No. X.5535 dated the ^«5th December 1917.

(MemoranduiQ by Captain The Hon, W- Omoby Gore, McP.) In view of the divergence of interest new apparent between the King of the Hejaz and Ibn Saud, j t may be convenient to aummariae, very briefly, the historical claims which Ibn Saud puts forward to the reversion of Kail. The dynasty of Ibn Rashid of Hail is of recent growth. The Family of Rashid began as the Wakils, that is to say, the Agents Generals of the Beni Saud, in the middle of the last century, viz., about 70 years ago. The Beni Saud formed a dynasty which, at the beginning Cf the 19th century as leaders of the Wahabis, ruled over the while of Central Arabia, and had pushed their conquests to the Holy Cities of the Hejaz. This powerful dynasty of Beni Saud was reduced, first by the wars undertaken at Turkish instiga tion by Mahomet All - the first Khedive of Eryyc - and still further reduced by the gradual assertion oi power and indepen dence of their Wakils, the Rashid family of Kail, The restoration ©f the power of Beni Sard is due entirely t© the energy and character of the piesent Tor Saua, who until 1902 wa« a refugee at Koweit. In 1902 ; P.iaiii, Ibn Saud - s present capital was part of Ibn Rashid s teniroiy and was administered by a Rashidite Governor, but Jr. that year the present Ibn Saud, accompanied by a few fjl lovci^ fiorn Koweit, succeeded in surprising and removing this r.ahiu uf ue Governor. In 1904 he had been acknowledged An aj1 the South Eastern provinces, that for 30 years had been under- 'he cor trod of Ibn Rashid - and in that year he advanced north, we&amp;t ward i.nti Kassim, but was forced to retire by a Turin eh force rent to co-operate with Ibn Rashid, However, in IOCS he . e't.t.r ued to Kaeaim and has held that district to tribute ever eince. In 1910, Abdullah, the son of the present -oi Hejaz, advanced into Kasrim, but finding tha c 1 on Aarh.’ d, who had lately made peace v/i. hr Ibn Sa.tivd ui d not co-operate A a ballan r**tir*»d to Mecca sii nu.lc ting th?t wlx€. impottfc^nt Kassim • owns ^hoild oontSN.

Owing &gt;;o the slendei. tnaj ?.e.e- his then resources, Ihn feacd v.-at, toj.cec. to l * c In 1913, the Balkan VTai arc’ internal distension in the H.une of Ibn Rashid, gave Ibn Saud a further opportunity, ineuaf of advancing into Kassim he wisely started'to increase— , r ^ tyt. his permanent resources by including in hio JXuriiJ\i^nis the . Turkish province of El Hasa lying alongside the Persian yUli. ^ |jle was able to carry out this latter project owing to British ^ support. In 1914 he had a Conference with two representatives of the Indian Government and invited a British Agent to his court, and soon after the outbreak of the present war declared for us against the Turks. Early in 1915 Ibn Rashid, spurred on by the Turks, advanced into Ibn Baud's country, north-west of^Riadh, a drav/n battle was fought, in which the British. Agent was killed. In the autumn of 1915, the King of tlu Hejaz, then Shereef of Mecca, sent Abdullah with a considerable force to mediate between the two Emirs, and at the same time to enforce the financial clause of the above-mentioned pact of 1910^ Jbn gaud naturally aspires to the reversion of Hail which formed part of his forbears dominions., and which only became independent in the year 1847. Hail occupies a position of geographical importance as the centre of converging roaas by v/hxch pass the stream of camels which normally go every year to Damascus, under the tutelage of the Ageyl, whose headquarters are in Kassim. the... Joff Meanwhile a third Arab power looks covetously at Hail. This power is represented by the family of Shaalan* the para mount chief of the Roalla, whose district extends from eastern edge of Jebel Druse^ southward to the oasis of This latter important oasis had for half-a-century been part of Ibn Rashid's domains, but was taken from him by Hurl Shaalan in 1911 and has formed his Headquarters ever since. Ibn Rashid still retains in his dominions the important oasis west of Hail called Teama, which lies geographically on the edge of the Hejaz. There is no doubt that the King of the Hejaz, Ibn Baud and the Shaalan all want Hail. A final word as to personalities. Ibn Rashid is a young man of 25, of no great force Of character. Nuri Sbaalan is an old man of 70, but has a son Nawal Of 40, who is an energetic and capable man. Ibn Baud is a fine type of Arab about 43 years of age, with great ambitions, and is clearly anxious to increase his resources and prestige by every means that comes to his hand. He is doing his best to create a Wahabi revival by the forma tion of religious schools (ikhwan) of the characteristic Arabian-Protestant kind.

Ibn Rashid is at present in no position to do us much harm, and affords an occupation to Ibn Saud, while his total elimination from Arab politics might be an embarrassment to us. His retention will assist in the maintenance of balance of power between Ibn Saud and Sherif.

Otherwise we seem to risk establishment of two powers in Arabia mutually hostile, but to both of whom we have given pledges of (corrupt giaoup).

G-eneral attitude of this side seems against encouraging or helping Bin Baud to attack Hail , tir^t because Hamilton's report reinforced by strong and obviously prejudiced representations by King’s sons have caused keen alarm about possibility of Wahhabi Militant revival vide Ara.b Bulletin No. 74; secondly because it is feared that Bin Baud’s secret purpose is to attack King and that he might do that successfully bringing to nothing all that has been done to secure British influence, in Islamic world through our influence with King; and thirdly because to some extent it is regarded as desirable not go eliminate Bin Rashid who might serve as useful counter noise in future rivalry of King and Bin Baud, though this point is not seriously pressed. It is fully realized that only possible military objective of Bin Baud is Hail and that he cannot undertake it without assistance proposed.while it is also realised that main object of Kajd Mission was to study situation with that end in view*but it is argued that recent successes Palestine and weakening of Wady Haifa position in Hedjaz necessitate reconsideration of-our plans regarding Hail, r While fully realising Hajd operations mist be subordinated to general scheme both military and political I must point out that intimation of abortion of mission will be extensively prejudicial to our interests and prestige in fjajd and will put an end to intimate relations established by Bhakespear in spite ol Wahhabi prejudice in (?) especially as such decision will be taken as based primarily on our engagements with King of Hedjaz betweene 0 „A if i- XM idle to pretend that there is be tween wnom and Bm baud iv i=&gt; ^ slightest vestige of teal cordiality* We cannot compel them to be friend^: but we can vary eft active* compel them to respect each others territorial integrity by with- drawing subsidies or threatening sea poits and in case S aud the valuable province of Hasa. Best means of securing reasonabi ;m dns vivendi between them is in my opinion to recognise-Bm Baud's natural claims to Hail and if he succeeds in capturing it his rule in whole of Central Arabia east of line to be fixed between it and Hedjaz. To encourage King to hope for suzerainty over Bin Baud or to attempt to persuade latter in any way to accept such position will only embitter relations further. At the same time I deprecate attaching too much importance to Wahhabi possibilities. The Akhwan should oe regarded as constitotiE standing army Bin Baud is perfectly justified-in main taining just as King does and will maintain regular force. .o«al number of Akhwan at present does not in my opinion exceed 10000^ or 12000 men in all and Bin- Baud could raise twice or thrice t-us number if able to arm and pay them. Finally capture of Hail would be serious blow to Turkish prestige and might hasten conclusion of hostilities m Hedjaz. I submit therefore it would be great pity to forego chance either because it does not suit King's book or becaase it raises fears of possible Wahhabi ambitions. Trust therefore that question will be considered as at time of Mission's departure from sole stand point of our general military requirements. Turks are by no means lone with yet however excellent our present prospects are and any blow likely to increase their troubles should/oe lightl* foregone In any case time presses if operations are to be undertaken this season.

Abdulla, when pressed to produce letter concerned and Bin Saud’s reply was unable to do so and changed ground somewhat repeating part about attacking Hail but admitting said nothing definite about Bin Saud remaining in possession though would have raised no objection. Do not remember hearing about this correspondence at Riyadh, but will enquire on return* Secondly. Am not inclined to attach much importance to alleged correspondence partly in view of fact that Abdulla appears to be leading in anti Bin Saud campaign and partly because, in present state of mutual suspicion not surprising Saud would not welcome proposal cooperation against Hail any more than Abdulla would welcome similar-proposal regarding Medina* Thirdly. Cornwallis writing declared express opinion suspicions of King and sons not based on very solid grounds and if Hajd Mission has succeeded persuading Saud ijake action this should be taken without delay as any real action on his part will go considerable way to removing those suspicions, Foutth. As instance of Abdulla’s attitude may mention he opened conversation by calling Saud son of a. dog and declaring him true to treacherous stock from which sprung. On the otner hand Saud’s conversation almost echoes that of this side while his remarks regarding siege of Medina resembje Abdulla’s regarding his inaction. Fifth.

Cox To:- Political Secretary^ India Office* 387* Following from Pnilby No*M22, Jan*9th.* Humbly venture to suggest Foreign telegram 17 S shows some misconception of actual situation of central Arabia which I have to certain extent anticipated last two messages. 1st. Bin Rashid*s power for harm still remains much as it was when Mission left Baghdad with idea of urging Bin Baud to action against Hail, while in spite of Palestine successes Turks are by no means done with and I see no indication of immediate break up. Capture of Hail in next 3 months would be therefore serious blow possibly leading to striking results all round. Secondly mistake to suppose Bin Rashid affords occupation to Saud. Have already pointed out that (?)Saud is not yet mobilized. Indeed ? he is more exercised by Sharif's ambitions and has no desire to play into ftis hands by making Rashid's position impossible except by action which is clearly to his own advantage e.g. capture of Hail by himself. Sannot expect him to be entirely disinterested in matter or really to enforce Qasim blockade unless he has something substantial to expect. Thirdly. Venture strongly to deprecate idea of retaining declared enemy like Rashid to maintain balance of power between our Two ? Allies. Such position will perpetuate strife in central Arabia and is likely to involve us in armed assistance to Saud under our treaty obligations against .aggression by Rashid possibly inspired by Sharif. We must always realize that both Rashid and Sharif are hostile to Saud. Fourthly, establishment of two strong powers under treaty with ourselves though mutually hostile is safest though ? boldest course. Neither can attack the other without incurring ourdispleasure and its consequences and we should be in strong position to compel arbitration of all disputues. Main danger | to future peace of Arabia lies in our forfeiting present strong confidence in Great Britain which inspires both King and Baud* So far as Saud concerned this will result immediately on failure of Mission to secure ?practical response by Government to his definite undertaking to ? serve our military ends. In such circumstances I do not anticipate his evincing any immediate hostility to Sharif but Qasim blockade will cease to be effective, and we cannot expect continuance of present intimate relations after his failure to convince Xk Wahhabi (1 groupjaundecipherable) opportunity of great practical advantage of British Alliance» N Result will certainly be attributed to Sherifflan intrigues. V Bo'‘ far as Sherrif concerned confidence will be forfeited if our agreements with him, of which I do not know contents, had in any way promised assistance in securing drift over Najd or Hail. Sherrif has no case but he certainly seems to have ? ambitions regarding Hail. If my supposition correct he can and in fact does not openly raise any objection to treatment of Hail ?problem on Military merits. Finally according to my view future political and present military condiderations combined to emphasize desirability of immediate | offensive against Hail by Saud with our help. Adverse decision will seriously affect our position in Hajd while favourable j decision promises accomplishment of one of our military objectives with minor drawback of little disappoint^on the part of Sherrif which he does not venture to express openly and cannot seriously justify.Hogarth has copy* (end.)

Following from Philby, M. 25, 1 lih January :— “Have had two interviews since last report. First, I produced actual letters t akhri with a view to convincing King, but latter resolutely refused to allow them to be read, repeating conviction of Sand’s treachery. In all matters relating Sand, King utterly impossible and unreasonable, though unable substantiate single accusation or grievance. Basic principle of King’s policy seems to me determination to prevent any Arab potentate sharing in bounty of Britain, lest his difficulties in establishing unjustifiable claims of Kingship of all Arab countries be thereb}- increased. Unable, however, openly profess such policy lie talks vaguely of conscientious necessity for concentrating attention on disposal of Turks, by which he means devotion, all material resources to operations Sherifian forces, no other object being worth serious consideration. Measure of assistance given to Saud will be our practical answer to Sherif’s attitude, which 1 venture strongly to deprecate in monarch of his standing as being attitude best calculated to create and perpetuate discord in Arabia, which it is our earnest desire to allay. reyc^As “ Secondly, position being obviously hopeless {V begs me) inducement better relations between King and Saud we decided to drop matter and I asked permission depart. Sherif created no altogether unexpected sensation by declaring firm determination not to allow me to return by land owing to bad political effect created already by arrival and likely to be enhanced by return. Personally, think this is mere subterfuge on a parallel with talk about fatigues and dangers of the journey in respect to Storrs, but Hogarth and Basset do not concur and have reported to Ik^ ^w^W'Jor orders as to the attitude to adopt recommending acceptance of situation. My arguments as to bad effects of refusal or our relations and his with Sand did not appeal to Sherif, who is in no mood comply with reasonable demands of Government in this conjunction. Venture strongly protest against King’s attitude to British emissary, now his guest, in view of fact that I came to Taif only to meet Egyptian representatives and would not have come down here except at his personal invitation. Trust you will support my protest and endeavour procure reconsideration ol attitude. “ Thirdly, my failure to return by land, joined with failure of mission to procure help for him, will not improve matters with Saud, and would suggest that if Sherif insists on return by sea I should do so on pretext, vis’-d-vis Saud, of visiting Egyptian Government, or L? 1 to collect arma ment and funds promised him. This would solve situation, but involves reversion to Hail offensive, proposals which I trust vill not lie lightly dropped, especially in view of King s general attitude. Could not pioposals be sanctioned, and requirements be supplied, without any intimation to King, who could not well protest if Hail was captured supposing no alteration uj Hedjaz situation, while if Turks and Rashid broke up befoie Saud iendy 1 could stop him taking further action ? “ Finally, please disassociate me from any personal feeling prospective total failure mission, but I carefully say if it results in nothing it is very great pity it was ever sent, as it/will merely liave resulted in pio\ing Saud perfectly loyal and making muUcu&amp;d suspicions of our motives and coolness towards us with possibly disastrous results. “Hogarth has copy.”TELEGRAM FROM SIR P.

No. 64. aaaaaaaa I ait, informed by No garth that Philby after discus- sion with, him presses following points. 1. At the request of Cairo Ibn Baud has been urgec for years past to take action against Hail, purpose of British ’ ission was to study Military situation with that objective, no other useful Military co-operation being open to ibn Saud. 2. Previous assistance given to ibn Saud in sufficient for serious action by him, artillery being useless without experts and money (group undecypherahle). 3 e Jndesirahle action hy ihn Saud against Gulf port or otherwise could he checked effectually hy our blockade and suspension of financial aid* 4, Occupation of Hail by friendly Power would relieve us of cost and unsatisfactory blockade of this importano distributing centre of enemy supplies. (Group omitted; ? 5). If we now call off ibn Saud after so much incitement we -shall forfeit his confidence and he will feel his interests have been subordinated to Shereefs through intervention of Cairo. It is then probable that development (sic) of anti- European feeling among Ateibah tribes will develop unchecked. 3. If Rashid remains independent he will be soughtSac? % sought in alliance by ibn Saud. or Shereef against the other and after war settlement will thus be complicated. My comments on foregoing are:- 1, 2 and 4. I maintain opinion in paragraph 3 of my telegram Mo. 1406. Military advantages of capture of Hail by Ibn Baud are less important since decline of Turkish power in Kedjaz and development of British and Arab (? operations) to North. 3. ^hese measures of coercion can be applied more effectually against Mecca thanRiadh. 5, Government of India’s telegram No. 17 S. suggests a safer policy. Information collected by Cornwallis from Kteibah sheikhs indicates that tribes are fair 13 ^ equally divided in allegiance to Shereef and Ibn Saud and that incitement by neither of these two is likely immediately to change situation. 6 . our aims should be to destroy Turkish in fluence at Hail; and there would be real danger if Rashid were to remain outside central movement and powerful at termination of war. shereef’s attempts through Abdullah to detach him from Turks have not succeeded hitherto as latter’s weakness appears he may become amenable. Military success in North, British gold via Shereef and Ibn Saud, combined with such pressure as latter can exert, should secure either his adherence to Arab cause or his replacement by a pro-Arab successor.

Received at 1,0, 9 p,m., 6th, s Reference telegram/from Cairo Noa. 1,406 and 1,467 of f ' 28th December and from Cox 6285 of 24th December, Ibn Rashid is at present in no position to do us much harm and affordsan occupation to Ibn Saud while his total elimination from Arab politics miaght be an embarrassment to us. His / retention will assist in the maintenance of balance of power between Ibn Saud and Sheriff. We therefore recommend that Cox should keep Ibn Saud in play by presents of money but that assistance in arms and instructors should not be given except very sparingly. Otherwise we seem to risk establish ment of two powers in Arabia mutually hostile but to both of whom we have given pledges of ( corrupt group ). We realise fully our obligations to Ibn Saud and have no wish to play unfairly by him. But we wish to avoid possibility of our generosity putting him in a position to upset equilibrium of Arabia.
