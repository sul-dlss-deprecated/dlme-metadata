Your correspondence with the Colonial Office has been considered in this connection, and 1 am to request that, if you see no objection, you should send a sample pearl to Mr. C. Dalrymple belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrein Government, at Bahrein, for examination. Sgd.) M. J. 9 LAUS 0 N 50-16 5000 7 36I© P.Z.6041/36 y'-N Colonel Fowle. You may be interested to see these papers about pearl culture. One can hardly believe that the Sheikh of Bahrein would be anxious to encourage gentlemen of this kind. It might be worth having a word with Mr. Belgrave about it before doing 7 anything. If it is quite clear that the Bahrein Government would not be interested, it would perhaps be best to do nothing at all and wait for the next move, if any, from Mr. Hoy££EL'. Malaculogj.et 4 502 V. Judd Street Woodstock, Illinois U. S. Ac June 3rd, 1936 CLARENCE F, HOY Minister of the Colonies, Colonial Office, London, England* Excellency, Great Britain has a number of colonies where there are rich beds of the pearl oyster, I have a process which V m 1 mnv r»r»n i a r» f-rt 'ho r\~F iroTi-i» + r\ rvrua o-T +V»dC5c» o/-.l r\n ■? £&gt; o generally termed genuine, wild or real pearl* You are aware that the Japanese have for many years been growing and marketing what is called the Culture Pearl* While the same length of time is consumed in the production of all of their pearls, the variations in sizes are attained by the use of mother-of-pearl balls of different size, These pearls are readily detectable by the expert and are now sold for what they are - cultured pearls* Under my process a tinY particle, such as a grain of sand for example, is placed in the flesh of the pearl oyster* by a much simpler and far less serious operation than is used by the Japanese. It is quite similar to the natural or accidental method by thich the v^ild pearls are started, When finished st\ch a pearl can, by no possible method, except perhaps a process of elimination, be detected from the wild pearlThis much being granted, the value will be the equivalent of those of equal weight and quality among the wild pearls. In© mmm In a letter of moderate length* I must ask you to accept as a fact my statement that pearls do not require anywhere near the time for their growth as is popularly supposed. It is quite probable that the age of a pearl weighing ten grains is between four and seven years The difference in time is accounted for by the variations b the salinity of sea water in various pearl beds? The higher the salinity the greater the amount of calcium for shell growth* the faster and larger do the pearls and shell grow. There are no pearl beds in the continental or territorial waters of the United States, I must therefore* seek a location elsewhere. So far as I am able to ]earn Japan is the only country which now leases sea bottom to private enterprise and grants ownership of the ^ultifateu sea life. Elsewhere the occasion hrsnot arisen for such action, I suggest that you choose one of your colonies for the introduction of pearl growth*: securing from me the exclusive rights under my processc In making this sugges tion I am assuming that it will be simpler to accomplish the requirements for such an enterprise than would be the case under a home ruled administrationo It is suggested as a government enterprise as such a form would assure the protection required against poachers. In the limits of this preliminary letter it is hardly proper to make any attempt to cover all phases of the matter* I assure you that I have a process which is satisfactory in every way and that such an industry will be most profitable. It is reported by the press of this country that the profits of the Mikimoto Company of Japan areN are something like $60,000,000 per annumo In submitting this matter to Great Britain I am refraining from making the proffer elsewhere and will appreciate highly an early letter of reply indicating your position*, Please understand that I shall be glad to furnish fully information which will allow you to formulate accurately your final judgment. Most sincerely (signed) CLARENCE HOY.» Copyc 6672/33/36. 29th June, 1936, Sir, I am directed 'by Mr,, Secretary Ormsby Gore to acknov/ledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd of June- on the subject of a pearl culture process which you have developed. The Secretary of State does not consider that it would he possible for any Colonial Government to under take on its own account the production of pearls by this or any other process. It is probable, hov/ever, that the Governments of those Colonial dependencies where pearl oysters are known to exist - namely Somaliland, Ceylon, Aden, Fiji, and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands - would be prepared to give facilities to a commercial company which was able to place before them sound proposals for the establishment of an industry of this kind? Copies of this correspondence are being sent to the Governments of the Colonies mentioned above. I am, e tc o, (Signed) G.L.M.CLAUSON. CLARENCE F. HOY, ESQ.copy. Malacologi st. 502 Wo Judd Street Woodstock, Illinois U. So A, Pile 6672/38/36. July 8 th 1936., CLARENCE P. HOY. Colonial Office, Downing Street,. S.Y/d,, London, ENGLAND« Attention Mr* Gerard L.MoClauson for Mr, Secretary Orms'by Gore. My dear Sir, I am pleased to make acknowledgment of your letter of June 29, 1936, it goes without saying that, throughout the EMPIRE, where there are many pearl beds, these beds are a very conse quential asset, I shall therefore bring before you certain information which has come to me during the past six months and which only within- the last 1 an days has crystal lized a certainty 3 As the general dissemination of the information I am about to convey to you would be disastrous to the pearl market* I am sure that you will treat it with reasonable discretion. It is my understanding that the pearling industry has found that their overhead expense is carried by the pearl shell which they take and that the profit, if any, must come t.nom pearls which are found© There are probably variations from this rule but, in general, it is safe to follow© Therefore, if pearl values are adversely affected, profits likewise must suffer&gt; A1 so as a general rule, when vie find some secret is being carefully guarded, we can assume it has some con- eidera ole valuer ForA For many years the stories told by the Japanese about the details of their operation for the growth of CULTURE PEART,S he Ye to one who is informed on the subject,, been ridiculous,. The real operation has been carefully camouflagedo Hearst chain of newspapers, wrote of an interview had wi\h a representative of the Kihimoto Company, Japanese pearl growers,, l n part he says, r 0n the tiny island of pa'iaos in the south seas, near Uncle Sam’s island of Guam, millions of oysters are planted on forty-three acres, Women make a slit in the muscle, insert a small fragment of mother-of- pearl, sew up the slit with silk, and 1 plant 1 the oyster This is the first tiir^e I have known the true facte of their operation for CULTURE PEARLS to be publicly told. This can hardly be classified as an error in diplomacy e In my opinion it can only mean one thing - the Culture pearl has ceased to be of prime importance in their business. There is something vastly more important af^ot. Aside from the Brisbane Interview I have seen mention of the island of Palau as a seat of Japanese pearl growing but twice* It first came to my attention in a report of a study of the lAiklmotc Company, made by the Japanese Government c Next, an article in the April .1936 issue of the National Geographic Magazine by Y/illari Price„ Mro Price mentions the efforts tc dissuade him from making a trip to the Caroline Islands by the Japanese a One sentence su3?fices to cover the pearl industry 9 'In the quiet lagoons oysters are trained to produce pearls in great numbers,' In the Brisbane there is an apparent utter candorc In Mr 0 price’s story is evidence of secrecy and reservecI' A nuTii'ber of iaonth« ago I offered to the Mexican Government the exclusive use of my process for growing OSNUITIL PEARLS, Finally, under date of June 19, 1936 and translated, comes the following, ,} We wish toexplain to you that the Govern*-1 ment has already engaged the services of some specialists for the same purpose and therefore will not he able to use your servicesthe only world source of such specialists is Japan. Please note also that they are employed for ”the same purpose. In che light oJ the foregoing it seems to me that one conclusion is logical* The Japanese have developed anu are now using some process for the growth of a GENUINE PEARL s My own research has 'proved to me that it is possible and even probable that they have done so* Plow will this affect the pearling industries cf the Empire’s ColoniesV The Japanese have never hesitated to flood the markets with anything manufactured by them with the cheap Isjouiv They will have no conscience about what may happen to the values of the pearls now held in the world*If they have *hac I chink they have, it must be borne in mind that, on;e out on the market no expert can tell whether the pearls have been grown intentionally or by accident., lo~irl P - - are (juite low at present* Neither singly nor in combination can this low ebb be accounted for o.y tiu- depression’ and the Culture pearl* There is another factor* v.- ich I believe has a very definite bearing on the matter anc this I believe is an increased volume of genuine pearls, cf Japanese origin,, If I have made a correct analysis of the situation what are we to conclude? Only this, - unless some agreement toe controlled marketing can be made with the Japanese, and /his l believe to be doubtful, the only pearl beds in the world which can survive such an onolought are those where a profuse quantity of shell can be had easily and cheaply and depend uponupon shell alone for the profits« Such profits will ho small of necessity. The salvation of such a pearl field would lie in some such process for growing pearls as I have offered* My process is so simple and fast that a very few operators could turn out pearls at a very nominal cost* I have no fear of competition from cheap labour with this process, I realize that ordinarily government would not undertake entering into such a business as 1 suggesto However, it seems to me that the circumstance is extraordinary,. This means commercial struggle Most governments spend large sums in experiment to develop military supremacy. V/hy not for commercial supremacy? Vith this in mind may I suggest a plan under which I shall be willing to co-operate* My experience has taught me that when it comes to growing pearls the subject is so new that it is difficult to interest capital until they have seen results and have been convinced that the process is as claimede To prove a process for growing pearls takes more time than anything else I know of. The experi mental plant must be set up, oysters treated and given identifying marks and then v/alu some months for pearl growth to show appreciable advancement* If your* government or that of one of the colonies were to establish a small plant as an experiment, within six months tnere would be sufficient pearl growth started to be convincing* At that time private capital could he very easily enlisted. An experimental plant such as I suggest could be carried on in a small way. There would be required a small buildingbuilding in which to work, tanks with some arrangement t.' pump sen water so that the oysters could be properly cared for before and after the operation, material and labour for crates in which the treated oysters are to be planted,_ ana part-time use of boat and divers who would gather young oysters for treatment and replace them where the planting beds are to be, I have on hand enough tools for a r. experimental plant. My transportation and expenses tu hh;- seat of operation should be provided for as well us &amp; guarantee of return fare and expenses if it should 're decided not to continue. The test plant should oe optruv-d for six months with a salary to me of 52 , 000.00 for tut 6 months period, payable monthly in advance. I do not se : how the cost of conducting the test for the six months e ' exc eed. Hl &gt;6,000.00» Before the test period shall have elapsed, peaii grorth v/ill ‘De started. I should use during this test a type of nucleus which would net be iound in a pea./*... ui v/nich are grown ’wild* • In this way it can oe indubitacly established that the pearls were started by me and eliminate any doubts as to my capabilities. It is ny suggestion that the Home Governmenr. c? that of one of the Colonies be induced to undertake this teste 1% has always been my impression that Australia was Britain’s greatest producer of pearls* If ao that might be the proper x&gt;!L a '- :e to undertake such a project * If there pay be any doubt as to the sort oi pearl which might be produced under my process I quote an opinion of Mr, A.M.Malpas, Marine Biologist of :he Ceylon Government, expressed in a letter to the American Vice Consul at Ceylon (Colombo), 'Mr. Hoy is correct ini miuntv — — £stating that, provided the inserted nucleus is minute, the resulting pearl cannot be detected from the naturally produced pearl, At the risk of getting into technicalities, I might state that the Japanese method uses a location which is among the poorest in the pearl oyster for the production of first quality pearls 0 This location is used because it will stand more rough usage than any other. I doubt if they have changed the location or have greatly altered the method- My process allow the choicest location in the shell to be used and will therefore produce the best of pearls. A pearl will approximate in quality and color, the shell at the nearest pointo 1 trust that the possibilities of a new pearl being produced by the Japanese and its effect on British pear] beds will have your serious consideration and that some sort of pisu* can ..e evolved. Needless to say, X would rather v/ork under British protection than in some country where language and other conditions are not so favourable* As the name Hoy is i ound in many parts of the world perhaps it would be well to state that my ancestors were English.
