Collision of boat of Mubarak bin Khamis, a Bahrain subject, with the boat of Abdullah bin Rashid al Eosiri, resident of Dammazn. ******No. 4-3J&gt; of 1352 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, J/Awal, 1, 1352 August 23.1933 Memorandum:- One Mubarak bin Khammas, a Bahrain subject has complained to II. E. Shaikh Hamad that two or three days ago, during the night, his pearling boat came into collision with the boat of Abdulla bin Rashid aL^Doseri, resident in Dhammam, subject to His Majesmyf&gt;in Saoud. The collision was entirelv unintentional. Mubarak f s boat was under the charge of his son Xhalifah bin Mubarak. The Nakhuda and men of the Dawasir boat thereupon boarded the Bahrain boat, beat the divers and forcibly removed some ropes, sail cloth etc. etc. The Bahrain nakhuda and nis men made no resistance but threatened to complain to their Government. I am told that Abdullah bin Rashid T s conduct on the pearl banks is notoriously aggressive. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad has told me to inform you about the matter in order that an enquiry' or a complaint can be made. Abdulla bin Hasnid is one of the chief men of the Dawasir who used to live in Bahrain, at Budeya, and who rebelled against the authority of Shaikh Hamad about eight years ago. They now live on the mainland and are counted as foreign subjects. H. B. M r s Political Agent Bahrain.

P.A. , C.S.No.676 of 1930 Adviser's letter 495 0/23.8.33 There are no pps. in V.O. .In the year 1930 there was a case of collision between two sailing boats inside the harbour,as a result of which the smaller jollyboat got sunk and a sum of Rs.250/- was lost. The owner filed a suit for damages which was referred to Majlis at-Tujara for decision. The Majlis at Tujara decided that Plaintiff had no right for damages as the collision was not intentional. * This case is different from the one referred to by the Adviser, which is a clear case of assault combined with theft. If the act of the assailants was committed within Bahrain Territorial Jurisdiction they will be liable for prosecution under the Bahrain-Order-in-Council at any time they are rounu in Bahrain. But if the act was committed in wzthzx a Foreign territory no Criminal charge can be brought against them in Bahrain. In this case the complain ant can, however, apply through the Bahrain Government for a letter of good offices from us and follow the assailants at their destination where he can prosecute them and sueJl; (CyCria-e^) fU Ci^AjU , J^hjL ^ ^ J ^&gt;^/ ^ y%-*\ ^ &lt;*-*~*~y CX^c^Z^n.
