I do not know whajf to suggest - Government may have some part worn but quite serviceable rifles which could be spared at a nominal price or it may, in consideration of the fact that the corps saves the presence of at least half a battalion of Indian Infantry see its way to effect rearmament at its own expense but the two incompatible factors remain, urgent need and inability to pay.

AHMAilSUT Oi' ItOSCAX IBi'AK TKY« in ifcrch 1922 Captain McCarthy, who commanded the Jiueoat mfantiy at that time, strongly recommended the re- arijiament of the corps with Short Magazine Lee-Enfield rifles, in the same report ( 268 of 20th March 1922) he estimated the life of the present rifles to he two years* Since that date the subject has been periodically revised but has again and again been shelved. I consider however that the time has corae ^hen action is assential for the following reasons. A* A b injured or lost parts of the long rifles cannot be replaced the number of unserviceable rifles is gradually increasing untill there will be not be sufficient for the establishment. This has for the present been obviated by reduction in numbers, but it is to be hoped that one day a return to the former establishment will be possible- ;B * Mark yi Ammunition . The corps was fortunate in obtaining the last consignment much of which is proving to be faulty. When this is expended, as it would very quickly be if any operations were undertaken, I foresee the greatest difficulty, perhaps the impossibility of obtaining any further supply of Mk.yi* In addition the corps possesses the following Machine and quick-pi ring Guns. 3 Maxim Eordenfelt M-Gs. which take Mk,vil Ammunition. 1 Maxhium Gewehr 1912 M-G. (German) which takes Mauser 2 Mitrailleuse Automatique Hotchkiss which takes Mauser Ammunition. 1 5 barrelled quick-firing Gun which takes Maxtini- Henry Ammunition.(2) Ihe difficulties caused by this collection of antiquated oddities can easily be understood, (a) as regards instruction (b) as regards mantenance of adequate supplies of anrnuni tion. (c) as regards the inevitable confusion which must ensue m the field. Taking all these points into consideration I would make the following suggestions* '- ) The Long rifles be replaced by Rifles. This can be done gradually, e.g., the first consignment would be issued to IJ.OO'S who would be instructed in their use before the men received them. (?) The one German and 2 French Machine Guns, and the Kordenlclt 5 barrelled Gun be replaced by Xewis Guns t^e 3 Maxims to be retained at present, in order to minimtee expense. Thus the Corps would be armed with weapons firing Mark vil Ammunition only. Finally I wish to point cut that the re-armament need not be completed instantaneously ; it can be spread over a number of months. 3it if the corps is to be an efficient fighting Mt H &amp;JU** j F rom Major R, Hinde, I.A., P olitical A gent and H.

Sir, I am directed to invite a reference to your letter u. 1561« dated 27th September 1924, on the subject of the armament of the .'uscat Levy Cor js . 2. lie Political Resident has gained the impression from Captain ccles 1 report in the enclosure to your letter that too much effort is being directed towards equipping the Corps on die lines of a regular Indian Regiment. 3. vVhiXe recognising that the armament of the Corps, when jud; ed by modern standards, leaves much to be desired, he feels that neither the precarious financial position of the uscat Ttate nor the real raison u , etre of the Corps must be lost sight of. 4. he Government of India have already shown the u trio s t reluctance to commi t tiiemselves oo xui ^her e-'pencii t jli e on behalf of the Corps, and under the present circumstances the .'olitical Keoident is not prepared to aak thcan to bear .the full burreri of such a rearmament as is now aug^ested until all other means of maintaining the fighting efficiency of the Corps have failed.-.0 standard of military efficiency to be aimed at in olie care of the Muscat Levy Corps is a considerably low.r n ' ' ne • oli - ical - esident thinks, than that attained by the average Indian Regiment. .he Corps has not been raised lor agf-recslve, but for defensive purposes and for main ten- -ance ol order within His Highness 1 dominions. 'he olitlcal Hesldent conBidere that the rciison d f etro of the torps will bo adequately fulfilled by a less ambitions scheme O j . armament than that at present proposed. He is not en oi. ely Ba. isiicd that the spare parts of the long M.L.K. riilee are inpoesible to obtain, and he suggests a reference to the Chief Ordnance Officer, i.irkee, on the subject. If it is possible to replace lost parts, the men who lose them shcula be made .0 pay for hem. With regard to further supplies of : ark 1 I ammunition, the Political v esident uelieves that there are still large stocks in India, from wiiien oupplics could be made to the Corps at a cheaper rate than i ark V11 ammuni t i 0 n. G. here are at present 100 Long K.L.E, rifles at Bahrain available for issue to the Muscat Corps when their present rifles are x/orn out. hese rifles, tiiough not new, are serviceable and are suitable for Lark VI ammunition. It may be ,,ossible to supply them free of charge. 7. In regard to the one German and two French Ilaxim funs, am to draw your attention to the fact that 20,000 rounds of auser ammunition for these weapons was supplied to the ^orps only a year arc at a cost of &lt; .115.15.3, and a proposal to replace them by Lewis guns is not likely to commend itself to the Government of India at the present junc ture. hile com elled to consider the proposals put forv'ard by Captain ' ccles for the rearmament of the Corps from a surely financial standpoint, the olitical esident fully realises that they spring from a keen desire to promote vpromote the effloienoy ana fighting quality of the Corps« hope?; that bexore long an improvement in the financial circums ancea ol the I us cat &gt; tate v;ill permit not only the rcplac mont of out of da'e (though still serviceable)equipment, cHU ..Ho alr^o a return at least co the former establishment. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ecretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Culf.

They also have the advantages of being cheaper and easier to maintain than foreigners and of giving greater effective strength as there are fewer on the sick list* Properly led I think they should do well, but the officer problem is not an easy one. It is too early to see what the solution is to b^, I agree with Captain McCarthy that it is desireable to have the Corps armed with the modern short rifle firing Mark VII ammunition. Kis Majesty's Government and the Govern ment of India must have a large stock of these and might be willing to provide 250 of them at a specially cheap rate subject to the old rifles being destroyed when the new ones are received* In view of the present financial stringency at Muscat 8.

It would probably oe inadvisable to ship to Bombay for trans-shipment to Muscat, as the Indian Passenger Act prohibits explosives being carried by stearners a taking passengers. Shipment to Muscat could probably be made in one of the India Office prize ships, and the material would then have to be brought to this country. In the latter case, the freight to Muscat on 20,000 cartridges would be about £ 5, in addition to s which there would probably be about 10/- for lighterage charges The iJociete Francaise state that they could deliver thethe cartridges in ten days after the receipt of an order.

Dear Bray , 1 venture to trouble you again in continuation of telegram No. 3-M dated 18th February from Muscat in conn ection with the case of C&amp;ptain Mccarty which is I think a very hard one . My telegram gives the salient facts of the case . McCarthy stayed on with, the Levy Corps at the special request ol the Muscat government and on the recommendation of the Political Agent and myself, but he expected to be releived soon after the 1st September, and thought he would have plenty of time after that to pass his examinations. But his relief, Alban, has only recently turned up at Mus cat and McCarthy will not be able to get back to India till March Which makes the time to pass his examinations very short. It seems to me that it will be very hard if he is compul- sorily retired without bonus or gratuity because he fails # to pass his examinations by June , particularly in view of the excellent work he has done and the good report by Col. Smith on the Levy Corps which he has raised . it is evident from thi report, that McCarthy is a very good administrator and organizer ana 1 should thinkjthe fact of his having raised and organized the Corps and brought it to such a state of efficiency might be considered good ground for exempting him from the ordinaiy retention examination. If not, I think his excellent work coupled with the fact that he has hac to remain m Muscat f or about sxx months longer than he expected through circumstances over which he had no control might be reasonable ground for extending the time for pas s ing the examinati on - % If de S . Bray , Esq . , C .S .1 ., 0 .1 .E , ,&gt; C .B .E . ,t Foreign Secretary to the'government of India - - - ■ ■ in the Foreign and Political Department. D/C.If however the rules cannot be relaxed in his favour l trust McCarthy may be allowed to retire under the Surplus Officers' Scheme with a gratuity etc. This is not^ I think / much to ask as he has had the right to do this up to recently and it is only his keeness for an Army career which has led him to resist the blandishments of the Muscat Government who wished him to adopt this course and stay on for a time with ■ the Levy Corps . I am sorry to have written at such length, but I think McCarthy's case is a deserving one and I sincerely trust you will be able to get it dealt with sympathetically with the Military Authorities with whom doubtless the decision rests « * Yours sincerely, Sd/~ A, P.

Equipment is serviceable Some form of khaki bianco should be used on the web equipment. Without it men have to wash the webbing more frequently and so wear it out sooner than would be the case if stains wer« merely covered with a coating of bianco. Messrs F.P.Baker &amp; Cc of 4 Old Bond Court Halbrook, London, IS.G.4 can supply this. Camel saddlery. Carrying equipment for the M.G's has been adapted for cmnel transport and is eminently suitable for the terrain in which it is to be used. I note the men are dressed in breaches and boots. As regards the former I understand that efcsgc they were originally provided under the misapprehension that the Coros was to be maunted one, as however it is infantry, knickerboc^rs should be substituted when convenient so as to allow men greater freedom of movement, specially necessary in the Hilly country in which ixx they will usually be required to operate. The Officer Com landing informed me sore fe vt wnwere a very com ton complaint. I consider this is due to ^tearing boots. The men enlisted are axx unaccustomed, propably, to any foot wear whatever or at the most, to light sandals, and ?^&gt;oint to be seriously considered is whether effeicency ^ould be greatly incearased by discarding /ok. footwear entirely.

In view of the fact that the institution of the Muscat infantry has absolved the uovernment of India from the necessity of keeping a regular battalion at Eeit -al -?elaj at a cost I believe of roughly a lakh of rupees a month would it be asking the Military Authorities too much to provide free, as a temporary measure pending the .chabilita -tion of the Muscat Finances, such small amount of munition^- as a3 5 e g ^ e t ( |}2^ : p e ?'l H .
