The detailed information available covers the period up to the end of March. It indicates that Russian hope of the Sovietieation of Persia still lives. Ways and means remain wnat they have been for years and the settlec^Cine of Russian policy is in Persia to support disintegration wherever it appears and by every means to reduce British influence; and in neighbouring countries to assist anti-British intrigues as far as possible. This policy has so far produced small re suite but in view of the internal instability of Persia and of the steadily increasing supply of trained woifcero from the Moscow University Bolshevik intrigues in Persia should still be carefully watched,.Very Secret For Inter-DepartiLentGl Coiamittee on Eastern ITnresto Prepared 10e6&gt;2«^o Bolshevik Intrigue in Pereiao (smcre Octotoer 1922) o Paget Section lo Rue so-Persian relations Section II Russian Official Changes,, III.

The 'Iran Surkh' Committee had recently been organised by Xhsanullah Khan. It was being subsidised by the Baku Finance Commissariat and its objects were said to he (a) To undertake intensive propaganda in Persian towns on the Caspian Sea^ (b) To organise local Military Committees with a view to action in the spring. On the 2lst February M. Shuayatsky wired to Kiroff, Baku r requesting him to assist a Persian named Bagir Zadeh to transport a printing machine into Persia. This ho said wae very necessary for political reasons. We have little definite Information regarding the strength and composition of the Persian Communist Party. In December 1922 the agents of M?

Svidence of this is contained in the reports regarding Baku quoted abovc p in the following reports regarding the connection / between M.

About the end of September a translation was obtained of * a document which had been typed in the office of the Russian Legation a few days previously. It described the aims of the Persian Communist Party and contained a note, apparently by 1U Shuiayatski to the effect that members of the Iran Communist Party had been excluded from the party at the time of Haidor Khan (who was engaged in February 1921 to carry out revolutionary work in North Persia on behalf of the Baku Council of Propaganda and Action). Money brought from Baku by Amir Khizi had been taken and squandered by Naib Zadeh (leader of Vartanian’s party) and his comrades who had therefore been excluaed. In the opinion of the Cheka they wanted money again for reorganisation. There . mignt be some honest men among tnem who might again be accepted as members 0 On the 2nd October Shumyatski paid 10.000 tomans into the funds of the Persian Communist Party.
