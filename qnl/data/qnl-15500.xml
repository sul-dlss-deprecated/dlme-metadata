It encloses the following items, only some of which are included with this letter:A duplicate of a recent letter (not included here), dated 31 December 1785, addressed by Rawson Hart Boddam, Lawrence Nilson, Robert Sparks and Richard Church, Public Department at Bombay Castle, to Edward Galley, Resident at Bushire;A copy of the commission (see f 49), dated 10 March 1785, granted by the Honourable Company, appointing Rawson Hart Boddam as President and Governor of Bombay, together with Robert Sparks and Richard Church as Councillors of the Presidency of Bombay;A copy of the commission (see ff 49v-50), dated 6 April 1785, granted by the Honourable Company, appointing Brigadier General Lawrence Nilson as Commander of the Forces under the Presidency of Bombay;A copy of an extract (no. 83) from the Honourable Company's commands, dated 8 July 1785 and received from Fort St George on 8 January 1786, which includes an extract from a letter, dated 11 April 1785, from the Accountant General to the Honourable Governor General and Council.The letter is dated 20 March 1785; however, given that most of the aforementioned enclosures are dated after March 1785, it is likely that the date of the first letter has been written in error and that the correct date is 20 March 1786.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023598787.0x00005d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
