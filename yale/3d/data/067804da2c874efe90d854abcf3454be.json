It was established over 2000 years ago and was the capital of the Nabataeans. The tombs and structures are now in danger of erosion due to earthquakes, floods and natural weathering and are thus in need of monitoring and documentation.\n\n184 laser scans were captured for this site in 2013.\n\nThe laser scanning survey of Petra, completed by the Zamani Project, is part of the Siq Stability project, which is a “Funds In Trust” project of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for UNESCO. It is managed by the UNESCO Amman Office and has as main partners Italian geological experts from ISPRA (Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research - Geological Survey of Italy), as well as geologists and a surveyor from the Petra National Trust. It is undertaken in cooperation with the Department of Antiquities of Jordan (DOA) and the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority (PDTRA)."],"cho_edm_type":["3D Model"],"cho_title":["Urn Tomb, Petra"],"cho_dc_rights":[null]}
