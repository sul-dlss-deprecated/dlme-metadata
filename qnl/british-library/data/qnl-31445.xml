Their action in attempting to seize control is likely to be resented by many tribes and there is every pessibility cf a general conflagration in that district. auc n a possibility appears to be f.reseen by Sheikh Isa bin Salih\ I N y i i aaliht wh.Ot in a letter to tiie Wall ©f Matrail dated 27tlx April 1928, asking about affairs at bur, writes w Perhaps it *ay draw to it what is quiet at present •' it will be seen fr©m Mafrer Hinde’s letter ho. 1436 dated 4th Oetoher 1924 and Colonel uroBthwaite*a letter Mo. 18 dated 8 th February 1926 that it was hoped the purchase of a steamer would increaae the State's control.

The bu All may hare immigrated from Banrein where the Bam Temeem were formerly strong. ( Col. Miles and Imams, and Saiyids of Oman, j. 339 ). 2&lt; During the Wahabi inrasion of 18 j. 2-1313, Balim bin Ali, Samimah aheihh of the Bani bu Ali, who was hostile to the rule of the imam Saiyld Said, became their supporter, helping them agaist the Bani bu Hassan. In consequence of the part which balim bin Ali took against the Bani bu Hassan there was a feud between the two tribes which resulted in a fight wherein Salim bin Ali and some of his people were killed; some of the | Bani bu Hassan also fell and as neither side would give in the war between them continued, and has been carried on more or less eonstantly ever since. 3&gt; Mahomed bin Ali who succeeded Salim bin Ali as Samimah. seceded from the tenets of the Ibadiyah and adopted those of the wahabi, throwing off the authority of the Imam. 4&gt; In 1820, baiyid Said haring heard that Mahomed | bin Ali Had induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adopt his creed, and that the people of SHAKKIfYAH had submitted to him, and that his followers among the el ASHKAKAH had plunaer- -ed many English ships wrecked there, applied to the English t, aid him in an expedition against Mahomed bin Ali and his con- -federates. The Bani bu Ali murdered the messenger carrying a letter to the chiefs from the British party inrestigating reports of piracy near Has el Had. Captain Thompson, in charge ef operations, decided to arenge the act and with a small f 0 ree / consisting of six companies sailed to Muscat where plans were made for the Sultan to reinforce him at Sur. The combinedforce searched on Balad Ban! bu All, the capita.1 of the tribe t but proved entirely inadequate and after attempting to taice the i town were sharply repulsed* Six out of eight officers and 270 men were icilled. in January 1821, Major General Sir Lionel SmifA' sailed with two brigades to restore British influence in the Gulf. From Sur, they also marched to Balad Bani bu All which surrendered after most of the defending force had been icilled or captured* The Sheikh, Mahomed bin Ali, was deported to Bomb^ ( Frontier and Overseas expeditions from India* Vol* VI ). 5* As late as 1845, the Bani bu Ali were strict if tyoi' fanatical in the observance of the Wahabi principles* They hayc since relaxed something of their rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco; but they continue to be exact in their observance of the forms and times of prayer and are accounted the most religious tribe in Oman Sultanate. They belong to the. Wahabi sect known as AOBAQAB. ( Lorimer Vol IX p .66 ). 6 * In the early part of Baiyid Thoweynee^ reign tiu~ Bani bu Ali and the Bani bu Hassan were almost constantly engaged in petty skirmishes against each other in which tsheikh Abdullah bin Salim, the grandson of Mahomed bin Ali, at the head of the Bani bu Ali generally won the day. About the same time a series of raids were committed by the A1 Waheebeh against'; the Bani bu Ali, these raids culminating in a serious engagement at Theeleyeh in which Sheikh Abdullah greatly distinguished hJHv- ?*self by totally defeating and routing the enemy. Towards Saiyid Thoweynee his attitude was that of neutrality, but Saiyid Salim duting his reign y having had reason to suspect treachery on the part of the Hinawi garrison at muscat/ sent a large present to Sheikh Abdullah and requecte^ his help to defend him in his position. Sheikh Abdullah gladl^ removed to Muscat with 300 men and garrisoned it but owing to /&amp; vacillatory policy of Saiyid Salim was dismissed after a stay 4 month® and had to return to Jaalan. Soon after this Saiyid Azzan bin Aais on coming to power^summoned him and the other Sheikhs of Bani bu Ali to Muscat to render their submissiont* I ♦ I ? * I on their having refused to visit him, he marched against the I Ban! bu All, seized Mujggft Majid, Thamees and hashid bin Salim by treachery and threw them into prison at muscat. sheiJch Abdullah, howerer managed to remain at liberty and thwart the Mmtewwa power in erery possible way. This led Saiyid Azzan to instigate the Bani bu Hassan and the A1 Waheebeh to wage war against the Bani bu Ali. A serious engagement took place at Lazzeh in which Abdullah defeated the two Hinawi tribes, and in revenge for which the Bani bu Hasan rose again only to be defeated a second time at Seh al Masaddee. 7. In 1870 Saiyid Temrkee having requested the help of the Bani bu Ali they joined him at Sur and 200 of their number marched under BheiJch Abdullah and Yoosuf against M&amp;trah where they both took a leading part in sealing the wall and in the engagement which resulted in the death of S&amp;iyid Azzan bin Kais and subsequently restoring order and holding the place till Baiyid Toorkee's arrival from Bur. In recognition of their services Saiyid Toerkee granted the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali exemption from the payment of Customs on the goods imported by them into Sur. 8 # In 1895, the Bani bu Ali sent detachments in support of Saiyid Faisal when he was attacked at Muscat by Salih bin Ali but they made no determined effort to expel the rebels an recover the capital for their sovereign. In recognition of their services Saiyid Faisal granted the Amirs of^ the Bani bu Ali an allowance of dollars 100 /- per mensem. 9 . in the Spring of 1903, the ordinary annual hostilities between the Ghafiris and Hinawis of shariqiyah being then in progress, Abdullah bin Salim found reason to suspect that the people of Sur, though Ghafiris / were supplying his enemies with the sinews of war. He accordingly marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satis- -faction were complied with. After Abdullah had returned to the interior, relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter and his opponents in Muqraimatain became so strained, that when Major. ((3^ 4^ 5l Major Cox arrived there in August# he found the two factions oru the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening •reek* The Political Agent# having obtained a truce for 48 hours# returned at once to Muscat and informed the sultan# who immediately proceeded to the spot* The Jenebeh would not at once submit to his mediation# and# before proceedings had commc ed in earnest# the Sultan was called away by serious news from Rust&amp;q; nevertheless his visit actually averted fighting for ti moment# and the dispute was adjusted# not long after# by neutral Sheikhs of the neighbourhood.

His eldest son Maser had predeceased him and as the latter^ son mahomed was still a minor# Abdullah's second son Ali was made Amir jointly with Mahomed bin Maser. An Arrangement which still continues. During the 1913-1919 rebellion the Bani bu Ali took the part of the Sultan# but / since the time Mahomed bin na^/ started to assert his authority relations between the Amirs an&lt; the Sultan have undergone a change. In 1920 the Wazir cut the allowances paid to the Bani bu Ali through misdirected economy but Mr. Wingate restored it. In 1923 the Amirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the said port} that the Sultan did not supply them with arms and ammunition accord -ing to agreement; and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Government replied that they were unable to intervene on their behalf. ^ 2 , In 1924 Mahomed bin Maser informed Major Hinde that he was authorised by the Muscat Government to i settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so with the exception of Khamis bin Mubarak of the Arama section. Fr&amp;a the records of the Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin naser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 offering 1 to effect a settlement between the Jenebeh sections* The iwtCw £ wfcvA-t— ^ ,U S ' C -^4*^TIJSl I ^ H ~ ■ — ^ ./?£) ! period, but after this period he was not to interfere in ,, , | anything. In 1925 Mahomed Bin Baser also attempted to foist a Sheikh ( Said bin Sultan bin jwahomed ) on the Jenebeh at Sur. This action was resented and failed. In September 1924or Hinde visited sur and rejfc^ ed* w I then enquired how it was I had received news that the Sheikh did not permit the new Customs house at sur to be built* Mahomed bin Baser became evasive and said nothing had ever been settled about it, finally denying that he had ever agreed to its being built and that he never would agree. He went on to say that the right of His Highness to collect customs at Sur and Aiqa had never been recognized by his forizars himself and his tribe .* In 1925/ Colonel rrideaux remarked that the Amirs were not very loyal to the Sultan and that if they had done £ their duty and given the Wali of Sur all the support he was entitled to there would have been no question of paying a ransom for the release of a Hindu who was kidnapped by a Bedouin* 15* In December 1925 in protesting against having to obtain a * ho Objection ' certificate froathe roliticalAgent before being allowed to import arms and ammunition from Bombay Mahomed bin leaser wrote to the Government of India; * 1 submit that ti^is request of the Political Department of Bombay is not fair to me as a ruler of an independent state and it would be -tz highly detrimental to my dignity to ask for consent or certifi 6 ^ from the Political Agent, muscat.

Before being allowed to leave for Muscat they were stripped of/ almost all their clothing. It appeared to Colonel .relly that a prompt and sever* example should be made of those Arabs ( of the Jenebeh tribe who were implicated with the ahabis in the plunder and murder of our subjects at Sur. There were other reasons too which ©ailed for the punishment of the Jenebeh. They had long been notorious among our n :val officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. They were among the Arab si slave dealers who had conspired in 1861 to assassinate the British Agent at Zanzibar It was also believed that of three seamen of H.tt.S. * waoj ' who had disajaifeared from their craft a few months before. The Sultan oi muscat was as; assured of their criminality and had himself proceeded to Sur fire or six months preriously with the intention of punishing them, but was obliged to return to Muscat owing to a conspiracy to dethrone him. Colonel relly had al»o in the preceding month sent the * Berenice ' to sur with a letter addressed to the Heads of the Jenebeh deio. no.ine payment oi 27,000 dollars as compensation for the property plundered by them from British subjects, and warning them that measures would be taken to enforce the dem nd.Their reply w* . That on a former occasion when Lieutenant Bengelly threat *1 *^1 / enedl ened a tribe on the coast, nothing was done, and that they were quite sure the Resident would not come now. * On the lith of February 1866, H.M.S. * Highflyer appeared off Sur to insist on atonement by the Oenebeh for their part in the affaifc of Augus^by payment of 27,700 dollats compensation within 24 hours. On the tribe attempting to procrastinate, a fire was opened which demolished their fortj the whole of their boats were either confiscated or destroyed; and a large quantity of their ship timber was burnt, ho personal injury was suffered by non-combatants who had ample opportunity to more, but a small part of the town was burnt accidentally, in consequence of a change in the dir/ ~tion of the wind. 4. In the month of June 1875^ a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader at Sur, a banian named Jethanund Motamull, was broken into, during his absence on business at Muscat by a party of the Jenebeh tribe, who offered riolence the watchman in charge and carried off plunder to the value of about dollars 1600. The spoil was openly sold in the town, and the robbers made no attempt at concealment of themselves, but no steps were taken by the Sheikhs of the tribe to eause restitution, and it does not even appear that they offered to remostrate with, or repress, their tribesmen, 5 . There was no wali or other authority on behalf j oi” the Sultan at Bur at the time, who could have taken action in the matter, and the banian therefore, on returning to Sur shortly after the outrage and discovering his loss, reported the matter to Colonel Miles and the case was referred to His Highness who promised redress. 6 # Soon after this H.M.S. ' Rifleman w happened to arrive at Sur, and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage coiiirnitted by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the affender and would have doubtless caused restitution to be made tot the trader, but H.M.S. ' Rifleman ' which only dropped anchor foY■tot \ a few hours incid ntally in passing, haring in the meantime weighed and proceeded on her voyage, the Sheikhs perceived how matters stood and released their tribesmen without further question. 7. During His Highness Saiyid Turki’s absence at Guadar in 1375 the case was presented to His Highness Saiyid Abdul Aziz, but without any benef cial result. About this time, however, the Sheikhs of the tribe went to the banian and offered an arrangement promising to make good the loss in eight months. This arrangement they afterward repudiated. H.H. Saiyid Turki was on different occasions reminded^f the matter after his return, but he was not able to put sufficient pressure on the tribe to cause them to make good the loss sustained at their hands, or to mkK bring them to account for their misconduct, and they succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to reply to H.H. until the season opened and they could get away in their bughlahs. H.H. finally informed Colonel Miles that he left the matter in the hands of Government and as the latter ••nsidered the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered by them injurious to British interests, he supported H.H's request that the enforcement of reparations might be undertaken by Government. To have held H.H. personally responsible for the loss sustain ed at the Jenebel^s hands would have tended still further te weaken H.^s authority and would have encouraged the predatory Arabs to continue their depredations on British subjects at H.H’s expense; while the exaction of reparation from this tribe would, on the other hand, be a cautionary warning to all- Colonel | Prideaux / the Political Kesident,also suggested that besides the original amount a fine of dollars 2000 should be levied on the Jensbeh, partly as compensation for the delay in settling ( it was then October 1876 ) and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subject. 9 At first, however, the Government of IndiaV. ( 143)^ would not comply with the Sultan’s request, claiming that the repression of crime and the punishment of criminals in the dominion of -‘askat was the duty of the Sultanj and that in return for the responsibility which it has incurred in guaranteeing to Saiyid Turk! the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy, and for other material aid which had been aflorded to M«H. from time to time, the GoYernment of India might fairly expect that the punishment of offenders in Oman would be effectually carried out, in so far at least as offences against British subjects were concerned, without requisitions being made on the British Government for armed intervention* 10&lt; The Sultan's efforts to comply with this attitud of Gorerument were so feeble and ineffective that finally in July 1877, the Political Agent was authorized by Government to proceed to Bur in H.m.S. ' ‘feazer ' and convey the Sultan's demands. When the political Agent arrived at Sur on the 24th July, he wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing H.H's order, and warned them that if they failed to comply to it within 24 hours, measures of a ooercive nature would follow. The Jenebeh had no recognized head at the time, the nominal shaikh being a boy as yet without authority, but several of the leading men came on board in reply to the letter. They expressed their readiness to comply with H.H's order, but explained that the absence of a recognized authority amongst them rendered it necessary for each member of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to pay on behalf of the rest, their chance of re-imbursement would be small. On this ground, and on the ground that several of thair principal men were inland, fighting with the Bani bu Hassan, they as .ed for an extension of time, and were allowed until sunset On the 25th. By noon of the 25th Jethanund's claim, «=F 1,6™- ^ ^ '16. when the Jenebeh heard of Suleiman bin Suweylum's intention to disregard this firmly established custom of the tribes of Oma^they asked the latter whether he really meant to imply that he would not respect the person and property of a tribesman coming into 8 oor under the protection of a member of their tribe, to which Suleiman replied that he would seize such a man eren in the house of the * Khafir * himself. This answer, it is needless to say, aroused the greatest indignation among the Jenebeh. On the same day Suleiman left Soor and proceeded to Maskat leaTing his son, a lad of 12 or 13 years | of age in charge of the Gore mor ship of the place and on the 6 th April Suleiman wrote ( presumably with the consent of the Sultan ) to his son at Soor and ordered him to build a fort at a spot which would at ©nee command both the water supply ©f the town and the caravan route to the interior. On the 10th t ©f the same month Suleiman^ son threatened to shoot a garden- •er and actually did shoot a bullock and cut down a date tree belonging to him because the latter refused to supply him with some green grass, which he was keeping for his own camels. 17 # This and other arbitrary and high handed acts on the part of Suleiman*s son resulted in a combination between the four fakhalds or sections of the Jenebeh, the Sheikhs of which sent a letter to the Sultan on the 17th April requesting him to issue orders to stop the building of the fort and to remove SHleiman*s son from his post at Soor. His Highness did not vouchsafe a reply to this letter and the building of the forly continued. There is no doubt that the possession of a for^ so advantageously situated as the one in question would have enabled the Sultan to overawe the Jenebeh and to ensure a large increase in the revenue derived from the customs at Soor, the payment of which is at present evaded. The Jenebeh were quite aware of this and on the 25th April they again wrote to the Sultan on the subject and again received no reply. On the 4th May Sheikh Musallam bin Abdullah withwith four other Jenebeh SheiKhs came to Muscat and placed \ i H-Jj) their complaints before the Sultan, but His Highness turned a deaf ear to their representations and the sheiichs return ed disappointed to Soor* The Jenebei^ seeing that the sultan was unlike -ly to accede to their demands now proceeded to secure the good will and promises of co-operation from the HISHM and the Bani Hashid tribes through whose country it would be necessary for any expedition sent by land from masicat against them to pass, but their Sheiichs still continued to send letters to the sultan on the subject of their grievanc es and His Highness* well wishers residing in the neigh- -bourhood of Soor also wrote and advised him strongly to listen to the representations of this tribe. 19* At length the Sultan acting on the advice of his brother Seyyid Muhammad bin ¥ 6 orkee and others, sent his head writer Hamed to Soor with instructions to hear what the Jenebeh had to state and to assure them that His Highness would be prepared to listen to any specific charges they might maxe against 5uleimun , s son. Hamed was also intrusted to direct the latter to stop the building of the fort, ho attention was however paid by Suleiman* s son to thi-jrfs order and the building of the fort continued. In ti the menwhile Suleiman who was now in Burica and had received the news of Hamed 1 s mission to Soor, wrote a letter to the Sultan. The contents of this letter have not transpired but \ * there is no doubt that it had its influence on the Sultan, for when Hamed returned, His Highness did not even trouble to hear his report of the result of his interview with Sheiichs of the malcontent tribe. 20. Matters were now beginning to assume a serious aspect and Sheilch Abdullah bin Salim, the 11 Temeemeh * or head Sheiich of the Bani bu Ali a tribe residing close to Soor who had rendered great assistance to the Sultan during the rebellion of 1895, now came to Muscat with a view of influencing His Highness to adopt1 **1 T7 \ I 4* '0 a conciliatory attitude towards tiie Jenebeto^but finding that the bultan was on tour in Semail he wrote him a letter pointing out that all the disturbances which had of late occurred in Oman were the result of Suleimans policy of unnecessary inter- -ference^in the affairs of the tribes and warning His Highness that a continuance of his present policy towards the Jenebeh would only result in his losing the little control he ^ji jirt possessed oyer that tribe♦ Sheiich Abdullah gave the Sultan clearly to understand that His Highness need expect no assistance from the Bani Bu Ali tribe in the event of his deciding to adopt coercive measures against the Jenebeh. 21 . This communication resulted in one concession being granted and BheiKh Abdullah returned to Boor the bearer of peremptory orders to Suleimans son to discontinue work on the fort. But the Jenebeh were not to be pacified in so easy a manner. They knew that before long Buleiman or his son would set aside the Sultan*s order and would recommence the building of the fort. They therefore informed Abdullah that nothing less than the recall of Suleiman's son would satisfy them. Abdullah communicated the failure of his nego- -tiations to the Sultan and at the same time once more strong- -ly urged upon His Highness the desirability of conforming to the wishes of the Jenebeh unless he desired a repetition of the Dhofar incident. 22 . On the 7th September SheiKh nashid bin Uzaiz Governor of Semail accompanied by four she liens of lesser repute went to Soor to endeavour to conciliate the Jenebeh but his efforts were of no avail. She Sheiich told him that the ^ tribe was quite prepared to fight rather than submit to Suleiman's rule. The SheiKh further pointed out that no reli- -ance whatever could be placed on sulelmai^nd quoted as &lt;W instance of his bad faith the treacherous seizures at | Suleiman's instigations of Sheiich aalim bin Hamed and Comer bin Abdullah at Dhofar. 23&lt; on the 18th September the sultan sent sheiich BaahidI ✓ l£&gt; - Rashid 'bin Uzaiz to Burka to inform Suleiman of the failure of His Highness* efforts to conciliate the malcontent tribe and to ask for his adrice. Suleiman was said to have advised the Sultan to use force against the Jenebeh and to be engaged in organizing an expedition for the purpose* On the 26th tarsita&amp;t news was received from Soor that the Jenebeh had cut off supplies of the garrison at the fort. The Sultan at once sent off a messenger to the Sheikh to warn him that the present attitude of the tribe / if persisted i^would only result in speedy and condign punishment. The messenger returned on the 30th without any reply» but stated that as soon as he had unless delivered his message he was informed by the Sheikh that/he left Soor before nightfall his blood would be on his own head. His Highness has now despatched a messenger to order Suleiman bin Suweylim to return from Burka to kaskat with all despatch. 24 , The rolltical Agent remarked at the times- It is difficult to say what the result of this deadlock will be. The Jenebeh are not a martial tribe but they are well armed and they have sufficient money to induce other tribes to take their side. The Sultanas is well known,has neither money nor troops. He may possibl* be able to raise a force f om the tribes residing in the Sohar district, but the men so raised will not come out with the intention of fight- -ing but merely with the intention of living at His Highness* expense. On the whole therefore it may be surmised that the Sultan will be unsuccessful if he attempts to coerce the Jenebeh as was the case when he attempted similar measures against the Beni Ruahah in 1896. It is difficult to under stand why the sultan persists in trying to force auleiman bin auweylim*s rule on his subjects against their will. This individual is at present Governor of Dhofar, Soor, and Sohar, but resides for the most part at Sohar governing the other districts by proxy. His sway is most unpopular amongst thev Ik' the tribes whom he governs and his policy of unnecessary inter, -ference and high-handed oppression in the name of a ruler whose sovereignty over the tribes is at the best but shadowy and unsubstantial can only result in disaster and loss to the ruler whom he represents. 2 §. There is however one aspect of the situation undey report which must not be lost sight of. A large number of the Jenebeh tribe own dhows, thirty two of which fly the French flag. It is possible that the French Vice-Consul may be of opinion that French interests at Soor require to be safe- - guarded and may apply for the services of a man of war for the purpose. If such a requisition were complied with it would in my opinion appear to be of tha utmost importance that we should adopt a similar precaution both in the interests of our own subjects and as a check on any possible design of the French. harly on the morning of the 4th October a force consisting of 600 of the Jenebeh under Sheikh Saeed bin baser and bin i&lt;ut&gt;arak, 150 of the Beni Bafaeib under Bheihh Saleh hln Yasser and 200 men of the Bani Boo All under iiheikh Hamad Bin ABdullah with 6 old guns attached His Highness the Sultan's fort at Soor garrisoned By 20 men and 20 Beni/RahsiB in which Suleiman BbcSuweylim's son ( the acting Wali ) was residing. The rebels opened fire at a long range and the garrison replied. This lasted for three hours without result ing in any loss for either side when it suddenly seemed to strike Saleh Bln Yasser that some members of his tribe were in the fort. The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a flag of truce and called upon the garrison to surrender. A parley then ensued and an agreement was arrived j at, Saleh Bin Yasser guaranteeing that the wall's son and the Beleaguered garrison would Be escorted in safety to the was accordingly evacu t on the 7 th.27 * Before returning to their homes the rebels destroy ed the new and half built fort referred to above. The Sheilchs wrote to the Sultan offering to hand over the fort to any one deputed by His Highness to talce it over except Suleiman bin Suweylim and his son and the Sultan despatched a fresh garrison of 25 men under Hamad bin Saif A1 Amri. The Sultan wrote a conciliatory letter to the Sheiichs informing them that he pardoned them for their late act of rebellion but it was generally believed that His Highness had only done this to put the Jenebeh off their guard and to attack them when they were unprepared for resistance* * ' r 28* On the 11th October sheikh Abdullah bin Amir the head sheikh of the Beni Bahsib called on the Political Agent and stated that he had been deputed by the Jenebeh to ascertain from him whether the British Government had any Intention of interfering in the quarrel between the tribe and the Sultan* He padded that the Jenebeh felt quite able to hold their own against any attack that could be made against them by His Highness by land, but being a maritime tribe they knew that they wpuld be powerless to resist the Sultan if the latter were aided by our ships as in the case of Dhofar* The Political * Agent replied that he was not in a position to give them any positive assurances on this point but that speaking generally ; he should say that any such inference would be very unlikeIjr so long as British interests were unassailed and British subjects remained unmolested* 29. On the 20th October the garrison under Hamad bin 8 eif A1 Amri which were despatched to take over the fort at Soor from the Jenebeh returned to Mask&amp;t and on the following day sheikh Hashid bin Muhammad a wealthy Arab merchant of Jissa who had also been sent to Soor to endeavour to conciliati the Jenebeh arrived with a letter to the sultan from Saeed bin Maser the head Sheikh of the tribe in which the latter while thanking His Highness for the free pardon granted to the tribe informed him at the same time that His Highness* garrison could not be allowed to take possession of the fort until the jenebehJenebeh were first assured under the guarantee of the British would O-oTernaent that no attempt /n future he made to re-appoint Suleiman hin Suweylim as Governor of Soor. 30 SheiJch Rashid further informed the Sultan that the young Bloods of the rebel tribe were in favour of destroying Sultan^ fort and assuming an attitude of defiance against Hid Highness* authority* but that they were overruled by the elders who sent the letter of which he was the bearer• 31 from the custom*s farmer stating that the Jenebeh Sheiichs had directed him to withhold payment of the customs receipts from the sultan,with the exception of the amount collected as punitive tax for compensation of British subjects for losses during the late rebellion Two Sheikhs of the Jenebeh who flew French flags 32 on their dhow and were therefore under French protection arrived at Muscat on the 21st with Rashid bin Muhammad. They both paid visits to Mons. Ottawi but not to the Sultan. The object of their visit to Muscat was not known but it was belieV- -ed that they had come to purchase arms and ammunition and to watch events. 33 # Saiyid Muhammad bin Hamad^ accompanied by a garrison of 60 mery took possession of the fort at Soor on the 25th November. The fort was found to have been entirely dis- -mantled# all the wood work having been carried away and nothing left but the bare walls. The Sultan sent 20 barrels of gunpowder and 4000 ball cartridges for the use of the garrison at Soor and ordered the wall to place the fort in repair* j^ring this period* the authority of the Sultan at Sur was being further undermined as a result of French intrigue. A plan of the harbour at 3ur* published by the French Government in 1901 showed that their attention jtojoaixttal had been directed to that place at some earlier date and and in 1893 M.Chapui* a somewhat disreputable French subject arrived atm 2-V . IQS at sur in a steamer flying the French flag and tried* hut without success to obtain a site for a coal shed there# The scheme for advancing French interests by a wide distribution the French flag was now boldly pursued. From 1892 onwards / abuVv -dant evidence was forthcoming of the abuse of the French by the importers of slaves at sur and in 1896 two Suri vessels under the French flag were captured by a British vessA in the act of carrying slaves# 35 . in 1900 Captain F.Z.Cox reexamined the question of the importation of slaves# He found that about 1000 slaves had been imported that year into Bur* of which about half had , 'V? r been carried in vessels under the French flag# In 1901 about 1000 slaves were again imported whilst in 1902 it was reported that the supply of slaves was abundant# 35 # in 1902* 114 Arabs were captured by the Portu guese in Mozambique whilst actually engaged in slave trading. About a third of them died in confinement while the remaindex 54 were sentenced to transportation for 25 years, with a few exceptions / these men belonged to the Jenebeh and Bam Bu Ali tribes of Bur. The number of the captives who might have claimed French protection was never ascertained but it was admitted by one of them before the rortugueae authorities th^- two of the ressels captured flew the French flag. 37&gt; in the Administration report for 1901 -03, Captain Grey wrote; “ Shis port from which there is a con- -siderable direct import and export trade, and which should U an important factor in the Sultan's revenue continues to beivj him little or nothing, and must inevitably remain a bad bargain to His Highness unless and until the much discussed question of the French flag in Oman is brought to a definite adjustment. So long as a large sprinkling of the chief inhabitants of this turbulent corner of Oman can evade the Sultan's juridiction and set his local governor at defianceI m i ILIL 1-4 :| ? 1 ^ y : i f in matters of administration, fiscal or otherwise, on the plea that they and their families and their property are under /Aey French protection, so long they wi 11 ^ continue to txw&amp;x leaven the whole population with a spirit of disregard for constitute -ed authority, and make it impossible for the ruler of Muscat to bring the administration of Sur to that state of reasoable efficiency which its importance as a trade emporium demands, and which would otherwise be possible* 38. About 1913 a blood feud started between the Arama and maichana sections of the Jenebeh which has continued ever since* In 1918 His Highness the Sultan visited Sur and fined the Jenebeh Hs 14,Q00and imprisoned 26 Sheikhs. This action kept the peace for about two years. 39 # in 1919 the Muscat customs were reorganized and the people of Sur, seeing that in future the dues would be more strictly enforced refused to allow a customs house to be built. In 1920 Captain Mac Collum, the then Wazir went to Sur in H.M.S. * Britomart * and the Jenebeh agreed to accept the CL new arrangements* Things went smoothly for short while and then smuggling began again and had continued ever since. The customs house was not built, difficulties being invariably ii placed in the way, and the wali became as powerless and inept as ever. 40 # Spasmodic murdering went on^and^n 1923 / the Council of Ministers sent sheikh nashid, Minister for Religious Affairs, to endeaMour to put an end to the feuds. He returned having been openly flouted and having accomplished nothing. In July Zuber, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Captain Alban and 150 levies and three machine guns/proceed- -ed to sur and occupied the fort. Zuber reported that he had settled all feuds and caused blood money to be paid over immediately in his presence and recovered 6,400 dollars customs dues from the merchants and fined the tribe 4,000 dollars. A site was selected for a custom house and the party returned to Muscat in triumph, unfortunately there was one case in which blood15 s blood money was not accepted. The Makhanah agreed to pardon titf- murderer, an Arama. He was imprisoned in kuscat hut was released in 1924* Meeting an armed slave of the murdered sheikh on the outskirts of iiur, he decided the man had been detailed to kill him and fired and killed the slave. This started indiscriminate firing between the sections in which one Arama boy was killed. The ifuwaris then took a hand and seized a water donkey belonging to the Arama and a struggle ensued in which an Arama girl was killed. The Wall was able to use the Ramzan fast for arranging a 45 days armistice. 41. About this time ( 1924 ) Mahomed bin Maser, Amir of the Bani bu Ali started to take an interest in the affairs of the Jenebeh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin RaseK Jenebeh sheikh of Masirah, and won over the Makhanah and A1 ahialin sections in Sur - the umx weaker party in the feud amoii^ the Jenebeh - to acknowledge his authority. 42. In 1925, Bheikh Mansur bin Maser went to Bur, informed the Hindu community that there was no iiultan*s Govern- -ment and that they were to look to him for justice. He tried to form a committee of leading men for the admini strati or. of justice as the local ^ali had been found incapable. The Wall told the Hindus that he was powerless and that they should infoAv the British Government. in 1927 sheikh Mansur bin Maser of masirah ( mentioned abobe ) accompanied by Hamdan bin Maser and aalim bin Maser, brother of Mahomed bin Maser of theB&amp;ni bi Ali stay** -ed at Mecca for three months as the guests of His MajestyIbn Baud. Mansur bin Maser died of small pox on the return journey. iI xKfmBxrtgmoamlim 7 ''Ti ajuL a j i jl . Ill SUMMARY OJf RECENT EVENTS IN SUR. lit 1927, the Aram and MaJchana sections of the Jeneheh each built three new forts in their quarters against the orders of the wali. 2. In August 1927, Mr* Thomas, Minister of finance went to Sur. As it transpires afterwards, one of his objects was to arrange for journey which he proposed making overland A- from tfur to Bhofar for which he required the assistance of the Bani bu Ali* He attempted to induce the Jenebeh to pay 2t laichs of rupees which they owe Khan Bahadur Basib and Ali Musa iChan, merchants of muscat, and tried to induce them to pull down the forts which they had built* It appeared to Mr* Thomas that the opposition to this came mainly from the Arama section and on leaving Bur, in the A1 Based, he tooic in tow an Arama sambuic lying in the harbour^ whereupon the A1 saeed was fired on by the Arama section* 5 # The Council of Ministers fined the Arama section Rs 10*000 and ordered the destruction of their three forts but I they have not been able to enforce this and have been looking to the British Government to assist them in doing so* 1928 * on the 10th April, the Council of Ministers received information that the Amirs of the Bani bu .-li Acid established a customs post at AIQA« Th#4r customs oflicer wrote to the State customs official at Bur demanding refund of customs which the state had levied on a boat which they said belong to the Bani bu Ali* The Amirs refused to furnish any explanation regarding the customs post to Saiyid Shahab, brother of His Highness and bheiich Rashid, Minister of Shara who had gone to Sur to investigate the recent trouble tnere. file Amirs are stated to have stopped a boatis- ^9, V i fr 1 &gt; of the Arama section from entering the creelc whereupon Sheilch al Majaala, who has only recently come to prominence as Sheikh of the Jeneheh, prevented a Bani bu Ali boat from entering the creek. The Bani bu Ali then occupied Balad as sur, possibly with a view to commanding the water supply of sur. On 15th April they were attacked in Balad as Sur by about 70 men of the Arama and itiwaris under the leadership of Sheikh lifahta al iSajaala ( mentioned above ). The Arama lost six men killed whilst the Bani bu Ali lost ten killed and three wounded. on the 23rd April, the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali wrote to the rolitical Agent stating they had been deputed by Mr. Thomas to recover the fine the Muscat State had impoBed on the Arama section for firing on Mr. Thomas and the Al Saeed, and to demolish the new forts. 8# It is said that both parties have sufficient arms and ammunition and their supply comes mostly from the Italian ports in the Red Sea. 4Translation# * # ✓ In the name of God, the most Beneficent,and Merciful# From Isa bin Salih* The esteemed Saiyid and Brother ,Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Basir al Ghashsham# After Compliments, Tliere is nothing but good to write to you ■ from here* As Muhammad bin Abdullah is proceeding towards you,we send you greetings and hope you will give true facts about your opinion concerning the incident at Soor,which is under protection and about the reasons that have caused delay in extinguishing the fire* Perhaps it may draw to it what is quiet (at present)* My sons,Muhammad and his brothers send you salams* By his order and dictation, Sd/ Muhammad bin Abdullah,by his own hand* B a ted the 29 th Shawwal 1346 21st April 1928*COHgXDEHTlAl. x'x I f $ I'Uk HO.

I sent a telegram to my office to obtain this but unfortunately the reply of the Council was forwarded to rae without being translated or read. It is evident from a rough translation that what was required had not been explained fully to the Counci I think that what the P.R. requires is a detailed exposition of the situation at Sur from the point of vie w oi the Council as distinct from my own point of view.What they think the Amirs of Jaalan are driving at. How they view the interferance of the Amirs at Sur.What action if any they propose to take and what attitude they wish the British Govt to adopt. I think the P.R. before taking any action on my reports or assuming any attitude tawar&amp;s the Amirs would like tne independant view of the Council so that he may know in any action iie may take, that he his acting strictly in accordance with their wishes.

Indeed w e understand from their letter that they demand 10,000 riyals to meet the expenses of their halting at Sur to fight the Irama. decision of the Council is as under;- 1. The Council does not accept this proposal and demand as it has no precedence. r'.ftei theii arrival at Sur, as soon as received reports ol their deeds, rtr e sent some Deputies in order to enquire from them about this action ahd to inform them that the Council does not T!r ish that any measure be taken no^ at Sur, but they did not listen to the orders of the Council and persisted in their intentions. They even said that if the Government do not a^ree to their pccupation their demands should be granted. Finally Sayid Shahab and Shaikh Rashid asked them to stop hostilities for t-o days in order to refer the matter to the Council but without result. 3. hen they (Deputies) saw their persistence in their demands they discussed the question of the Customs which they had established at Aiqa but they did not give an^y answer and made a truce between themselves without reference to the Government. Keeping their objects in view they are making preparation to attain their ends and the Government of Muscat has not taken any action in the matter up to now, Te have received a letter fea dated the 14th Dhil Hejjeh 134(3 f a om Shaikh Isa bin Salih al Harithi in which he says tt If you neglected the matter X si.iould not be blamed (for any action whiciL may be taken by me).

The Council his therefore arrived at the decision that if the Government do not take any measure to check the movements of Beni 3u Ali, the result ^ill be very bad as the Jim is -ho do not like the suzerainty of Beni Bu Ali at Kur may take advantage of this opportunity to make interference at £ur.

We trust that yon are in perfect health. Captain Walker attended the Majlis yesterday and stated that &gt;ou had asked him to enquire from the Council of Ministers about the state of affairs at Sur, and about the sons of Abdullah bin Salim al Hamuda, Amirs of Beni Bu Mi, the situation of Sur and its importance to the Covernment of Muscat, the recent events which took place there a,.d continues up to now, the objects of the sons of Hamuda and their intentions at bur, the effect of their interference and actions, views of the Majlis as to -hat measure should be taken for checking the said individuals and -hat support the Government of Muscat should expect from the High British Government as they used to biYe ln important affairs, and that the vie-s of the Majlis are req ired before any actionbe taken in the matter. ”e therefore submit to you our vie s and opinions in details on the subject. Usual Unding.wmmm^ Pecision of ga.iiiB, The port of Sur is an important port to the Governnent muscat and is considered to be the third port in importance after Muscat and Mairah from commercial point of view as it is a port in -rhieh O oods are imported from the Eastern Oman*and an importanr bazaar for its tribes, Goode are imported into Bur by land as ’-ell us oy sea and also exported from it. The Government of Muscat receive a considerable amount of revenue trom Sur. This is from the economical and commer&gt; ial point of vie^. As iegarde its political situation Sur is one of the important ports to the Government of Muscat as it is a resort for all tribes of that part ''ho arrive and depart there for the puipoae of transaction of business. For that reason the Govern ment of iiiusoat had absolute influence and control over that part. UtA- Tue i nh. 01 tan ts of Sur^ almost tne four sections of the Jana bah tribe and re obe lent to the Governnent ^ho Mike peace and settle their internal disputes whenever they arise between them. Ae regard© the sons of al &gt;kotiuda # Chiefs of iieni iiu Ali of Ja f aian, they ^ere since olden tii es obedient to the orders of and friendly to the Muscat Government. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim father of these Chiefs ^as especially a faithful friejol of the Muscat Government. He used to assist ^ith his followers In aflairs concerning the Fuscat Government whenever he -as called upon to do ao and maintained that attitude till the end of his life. The Muscat Government in recognition of his cervices sanctioned a monthly allowance for him. ’hen he died his sons viz . Ali bin Abd llah raid Fuhammnd bin Nasir succeeded him and at the beginning of their rule folio,ed in the footsteps of their late father in cunee yi nee of which the Government agreed to pay the same allowance to them -hieh their father used to get it. Their behaviour has recently dM change* at the instigation of £J2ne one and consequently they have put forward some claims -hich they have no right to do nor their fathers who w ere before them j iiad enjoyed such privileges. In m4 hostilities end fighting oroice out bet-een the Wo tribes namely Aramah and Makhanah which continues up to now. The sons of Hamudah asked the Government ofn \ 2 . m Muscat fur permission to make peace between the aforesaid tribes and the Council accorded this to ^hem. This request ras made by them both verbally and in -riting and their letters are on the record of the Majlis. They interfered at the beginning in the affairs of Sur in this -ay but they had another object in view and thatitheir absolute controfover Jsnabah and Sur. They were contented with this but established a Customs House at Aiqa for collecting revenue and notified openly to that effect. Oing to tae hostilities between the Aramah and Makhanah they have recently entered Sur with their force in order to establish their authority over the inhabitants pretending that that they had been ordered by the Government of Muscat to make peace between al Aramah and al hakhanah tribes but they have got a different object in view. They have c oMnenced hostilities and fighting with those who did not comply with their ’'ishes. The Majlis then sent Deputies to Sur to investigate into the affair amt but they (Beni Bu Ali) told them that they were acting according to the orders of the Govern- r;ont. The Deputies asked them to stop the fighting which was against the wishes of the Government but they did not obey and thus their secret intentions that is their control over Sur. collection of revenue and aggression to the inhabitants became ...o ~n. In vie. of ohe foregoing facts it is necessary that the condition of Sur should be put right and saved from these transgressions because Sur is considered as one of the limbsjof the Muscat Government and no other authority but the Government of IviuBCctti sliould ruie over it. .is to the political point of view, Sur is a centre for all aifairs concerning the Eastern parts as has already been stated by us. The Muscat Government can exercise their authority over -nose parts and their people who are great in number as long as Sur is under their control, and do not w ish to ceaBe their relations rith them, n ‘ Th6 Said tribes themselves do not agree to any other authority at Sur besides the Muscat Government especially the Oman tribes ’-ho £x -ill not hesitate to seize the opportunity of stepping into! QJ? V 3. Sur if the Government neglected it and therefore the Muscat Government are obliged to take steps to keep off the Shaikhs of Beni Bu Ali from Sur. IjI. From the financial point of view there is no doubt that losses ’-ould be incurred if the condition is changed at Sur and particularly if another Customs House besides the Government's -ould be established there. If a Customs House besides that of Muscat Government be established near Sur the boats -ill visit Customs -ithout the information of the Government and thus tuey -ill find an open -ay for dealing in the prohibited trade -hich the Government of Muscat has undertaken to suppress it. The arabs as it is their habit were endeavouring to find a means to do so. It should be k.o-n that the sons of Hamudah are Shaikhs at Ja’alan and Chiefs of their o-n tribe Beni Bu Ali only. They nave no right to exercise any co .trol over Sur and if the Govern ment of Muscat withdraw their authority the tribes of Ja'alan and the Eastern parts of Oman who are stronger than them $Beni Bu Ali) will rise against them. The Council of Ministers are of opinion that by the assistance of the British Government they should proceed by a Man-of-war to Sur where they would discuss matters with the subjects and effect a settlement in the disputes between them in any way that the Government deem advisable and if some of them do not agree to the adjucations of the Government they should be punished. Then the sons of al Hamudah should be warned to refrain from interfering -ith me affairs of the subjects of Sur. to abolish the Customs House -hich they had established at Aiqa, to pull down the building which they had erected at the entrance of the creek as there -as no such building before and its existence will cause a loss to the Muscat Government and the subjects and by Means of that building they can prevent boats from entering the creek or ^uing out of it and take taxes from them. These are .the vie-s of the Jfe jlls with regard to Sur affairs and the condition is has been explained by us. The Muscat Government request H.B.M's Government to support them as they used to support the Muscat (rovernment and their Sultans.2 . assistance they would not be able to prevent them and manage affairs concerning the Customs administration, etc. H the + +w s ionet^qcistance from us they ^ould Janahah tri'be even now get the leastdssis never submit to Beni Bu Ali’s demands. The l£ta±s±*^K£ Council of Minister,- for-arded to me the letter .hioh%d received from the Shaikh of Beni 3u Ali c,amandin* payment of expenses which they had spent during their „ nh the Janabah as they considered that their last action -as ym ntatement was true they 'oulit hy order of our Government. If their statement . rien,,ties of my Government Ministers during not have opposed tne Pepuiieo oi my o their last aggressions at Sur. Under these circumstance we will never accept their demand because we did not order them at all, and if they had been ordered by my Government to rise against the Janabah there would have been a representative on our behalf with them. If our friend the Government will not attempt to assist my State in the affairs of Sur and its dependencies at an early date the result ill be unsatisfactory. You are aware about tie opinions of the Shaikhs of other tribes in connection with the actions of t lie (Beni 3u Ali) tribe, and the weakness of 4 - -y/i t o f .\r of support from our friend H.B.M’b our Government and laeic oi Government, therefor.

Letter No.71/61 dated 29th June 1928 j tions of the with enclosure from the Council of ) Ministers to H.H. the Sultan. marginally noted 3. Letter dated 6 th July from H.H. the Sultan of Muscat. letters from the Council of Minister and from H.H. the Sultan of Muscat expressing their views on the letters and actions of the Amirs of Ja f alan and their opinion as to how recent events in Sur ^ill react on Muscat Government control over the district. The first reply from the Council did not apx;*ear to me to c^ver the subject fully enough and I held therefore to write and obtain a further reply. 'Thilst in Bombay, H.H. the Sultan himself broached the subject of Sur and I took the opportunity to obtain from him his ■ views on the subject in writing. The Council have been reluctant to express their views fully in writing without first obtaining the views of H.H. the Sultan; whilst H.H. considered he had given the Council full powers and wished them to act on their o^ui initiative. TheThe views of the Sultan and the Council are identical. They resent the letters and actions of the Amirs of Ja’alan but realize that they are not strong enough to deal ^ith the situa tion without the support and assistance of the British Government, and that unless they obtain such assistance, the little control which the Muscat Government exercises over Sur ^ill cease. A number of Ara.bs in Oman are of opinion that the British Government are not anxious to see a strong rule established at Muscat and that they ^ould countenance the forma.tion of another independent authority in Ja’alan. This, I have heard, is the opinion of the Amirs of Ja’alan. The Council do not consider that the Amirs of Ja f alan #ave sufficient influence over other tribes to establish themselves firmly as independent rulers of Ja’alan, but fear that the Imam T s Government might interfere and obtain mastery over Sur. The loss of revenue from Sur and the possible deviation of trade from Muscat to Sur ^ould be a heavy blow to Musca.t i*evenues. The prestige of the Muscat State rests on the support, moral and physical, ^hich they are able to obtain from the British Government. Without such support the State is impotent. I am of opinion that unless the State receive some supijort to enable them to withstand the aggressions of the Amirs, their authority will diminish not only in Ja»alan but also in other parts of their territories.

After Compliments. T7e have duly received your letter dated June which was were issued at Shiraz under a certain number, siax much pleased to hear of your welfare and were acquainted with its contents up to the end. You had remarked that Sur is a part of Muscat. That must have been an imagination by you. Sur is a port and a part of the territory of Ja f alan and its geographical situation is a clear proof for it and therefore we say that Sur is absolutely not a part of Muscat. As regards the establishment of the Wall and payment of revenue we beg to state that that has been brought into effect at our consent. The town of Sur and its Customs Department are under our protection at present and everything will be accomplished in its proper time. With regard to the claim of our subjects, Bani Bu Ali, against the Italian Government, we hoped and still hope that through the mediation of your Government the dues of our subjects would be recovered as was promised in the letter of your Secretary which was sent to us by our man. now see that you are referring us to the Muscat Government. There is no necessity for doing so as this question and all matters relating to us ' have nothing to do with the Muscat Government. T7e have also received a letter from H.B.M's Consul Muscat advising us to refer our affairs to him through the Muscat people (Govt.). Y/e team do not deem it advisable to represent our affairs to the Government of Muscat. If you are not able to do anything in the matter of the claim of our subjects please let us know so that we take the necessary action in the recovery of their dues. % As to your visit to these parts you are welcomed and we are obliged to renew the old friendship which existed between our predecessors and H.B.M^ Government.
