Briefly the problem is as followst The Company jointly with The Arabian American Oil Company, hire Cinema Films from various distributors in India* The distributors allow approximately twenty- nine days from the date each film leaves Karachi until its return for transportation and screening time both here in Bahrein and in Saudi Arabia at Dhahran, Ras Tanura and Abqaiq. Whereas every endeavour is made by both the Company and The Arabian American Oil Company to expedite the screening and transporta tion of the films between the four cinemas, we invariably find that the period allotted by the distributors has almost expired, and in some instances has expired, by the time we are able to return the films for despatch by air to Karachi. With the prevailing scarcity of air freight space further delays occur through the inability of The British Overseas Airways Corporation to load the films since they are non-priority freight. The distributors are seriously disturbed by the loss of revenue sustained by them through the frequent late arrival of films in Karachi and we fear that a continuation of these delays might easily result in the cancellation of the contracts. This would mean a serious loss of en tertainment to the detriment of morale and we are anxious to eliminate any waste time which occurs in transportation. We will appreciate your early advice on the above.
