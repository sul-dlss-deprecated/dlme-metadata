Correspondence discusses the local labour requirements (up to 2500 men) for construction works, the encroachment of the site and its buildings onto adjoining land, the condition of the road alongside the site, and a public petition raised by villagers residing on the north coast of Muharraq, who have effectively been cut off from the rest of the island by the aerodrome.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Muharraq, British airbase</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000098#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000098#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
