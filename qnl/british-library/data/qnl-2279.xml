K/20 V.O. ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES OF ORPHANS. FILE NO.No. 162/26-9A—of 1356 Office of the Adviser to the Govermaent, Bahrain. Dated, Maharam 29, 1356 April, 10,1937 From C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. /26 nMn To His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that for many years this Government has been gravely concerned over the unfortunate condition, of orphans and minors. In numerous cases it has been proved that the guardians and administrators of wealthy minors have misappropriated the property ol the heirs so that when the minors came of QS® nothing was left of their inheritance. Among the most notorious cases of this kind are those of Ali bin Sagar ol Auharraq and the heirs of his deceased orother Shahin, iihmed bin Bashid al Naimi and his minor brothers and sisters, Ibrahim Seraifi and many others. In some cases the administrator used the property of minors in the diving industry, which is forbidden accord ing to the Shera and in other cases the guardians merely misappropriated the property or spent the money on themselves —- 2 - themselves: this state of things has for many years been a public scandal and has been much commented on by respectable members of the com munity. At present there is no check on the dishonest practices of guardians and adminis trators of property of women and children. The Qadis in the past, both Sunni and Shia, with one exception,have acquiesed in this scan dalous state of affairs and have opposed various attempts of the Government to impose legislation to protect the interests of minors. Undoubtedly some of the Qadis have been induced by gifts of money from the guardians, which were ostensibly to be used for charity, to abstain from inter fering in the administration of estates of minors. Whenever the Government has tried to deal with the matter a number of influential people, who are themselves administering ©states, greatly to their own advantage, have successfully opposed any reforms. Their success has been mainly due to the support of the Qadis. 2. For several years Shaikh Ali bin Hassan the oldest of the three Shia Qadis, has stressed views on the matter which differ from those of his colleagues. He has constantly urged the Government to take over the administration of the estates of minors. 3. During the last few months conversations have been taking place between myself and Shaikh Abdullah bin Shaikh Hamad, representing the Govern' Government —Government and the three Shia ^adis with a view to lorming a department for vtotking after the interests of minors and for the protection and the administration of their estates. After long conversations and much argument the enclosed memorandum was drawn up and signed by the {^adis. It has the approval of the Bahrain Government. The general public are unaware of this agreement which only iffects the Shias but if it comes into force I am sure that sooner or later the force of public opinion will compel the Sunni ^adis to take similar measures. 4. The gist of the memorandum is that the three Qadis, with suitable staff, assisted by a committee of siz of the general public shall form a department for the purpose of adminis tering the estates of orphans who have no legal guardians. In addition they will have authority to examine the administration of guardians who are appointed by will and all wills will be sub mitted to them for signature. These regulations are to apply to all Shias, Bahrain nationals or foreigners and for this reason I am referring the matter to you. The Qadis regard it as essential that, if the proposals are acceptable to you, they should be brought into force by proclamations to be issued simultaneously by the Bahrain Government and the Political Agency. I agree that this is desirable. 5. I consider that if the proposals embodied-4- the memorandma are brought into force the exist ing abuses will be lessened and the interests of minors and orphans will be safeguarded to a certain extent. It is notjin mydpinion, an ideal solution of the problem; I am sure it would be more satisfactory if this department was entirely dissociated from the Qadis but it is a step in the right direction. The whole matter has been approved of by His Highness Shaikh Hamad and also by Shaikh* Abdullah bin Isa and Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad who have kept in touch with the progress of the negotiations. There will be opposition from a certain faction of the Manamah Shias but I think the proposals will be acceptable to the majority of the Shia Community. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Adviser to the Grovemment.Memorandum The following points have been approved of by the Government and agreed to by the Shera about the opening of a department for the preservation of the affairs of orphans and their properties:- 1. This department and all its affairs shall be in accordance to the Jaffaria sect. 2. The &lt; directors of this department shall be the official tyadis or whoever shall take their place after them, and the staff of this deoart- ment will be appointed with the approval or the Qadis. 3. This department shall have the right according to Shera to administer for everyone who has no special guardian such as persons absent -from Bahrain or insane. 4. This department has authority over every Jaffariah though not a Bahrain subject. 5. In the event of a minor having a special guar dian such as the grand-father of the father or a testator appointed by the minor’s father, nobody has the right to interfere in the affairs of his guardianship or his will, unless it appears to the Snera that he exceeds the Shera limits. 6. If the Qadis wish to notify the public about wills ot testators, the Government will assist by notifying the public by proclamation and by enforcement. 7. In orders cpncerning religious duties which are now vested in the Snia WaEf Department regarding prayers, fasts, who has shares, charity, pil grimage and such like, the Shara may be consulted m order to decide the qualification of those who are worthy. The Shera has no intention of administering the Shia Wakf Department by leasing, by receiving proceeds and exempting etc. but the intention is as mentioned above. 8. If any person wishes to make a will he shall take the opinion* of one of the Official (^adis in order that the will should be according to Shara and afterwards the will should be submitted to the official Qadis for endorsement. 9. To be an official department of the Government. 10. Accounts of the department to be in the Bank in the name of the department and payments and receipts to be under the signature of the three Q,adis. 11. A committee to be appointed consisting of six members, three to be appointed by the Government and three to be appointed by the public to assist in accounts and repairs, members to be changed every two years.i i 12. 13. - 2 - The staff of the department to be paid by the Government and all usual regulation^ to apply to them, such as provident fund, leave, etc. The staff to be approved by the Qadis. Both governments, the Agency and the Bahrain Government to write two letters to the Shera explaining to them the administration of this department according to the above points, note:- On further discussion ti was decided that the committee should be appointed as follows:- two members to be appointed by the Government, two members to be appointed by the Qadis, two members to be appointed by the public.From Adviser to THE Bahrain Government.

Yrfhen we saw your kind attendance ana interest in protecting the rights of the people ana shortening the hands of those who misappropriate certain amounts of the rights(of the people)particularly the rights of the orphans and waste their properties, we liked to assist the Government in inaugurating a Shara' Department for the protection d&gt;l* the orpnanS properties lest the recurrence of the action of the ex-Qauhi Shaikh Abdullah bin Muhammad Salih who committed the greatest crimes in stealing the properties of the orphans such as Sairafi, ill Mirza ana Bin ahiaif which are not hidden to your honour. They are the greatest crimes by which commission he blackened his history and weakened the rightful people of religion ana upset down the SharaJ on his head. We see those rioters who interfered against this policy in spoiling this problem, creating difficulties between the Government and the subjects and confusing the country are Mutism al Tajir, ’Aba T Ali bin Rajab and oayid Sai‘a wim wiium joined Shaiim ijaqir with a view to forming parties and seeking leadership, ne see all Government secrets which ought to be reserved by him are spread about in the bazars ana this is aue to the overcoming of those mentioned above on his idea. For instance, when ^aji Mulisin bin Zahar died he went him®clf without informing and discussing the matter with us and locked up the doors and took the keys, informed the Adviser who referred the case to us with a view to strengthening the point of the% &gt; JO establishing of tne proposed department. &lt;ie waited until the mourning cays for the deceased were over when we wanted to start with the case with the formation of an inspecting Committee ana a clerk iQ,?' the Court of Justice, unexpectedly the Adviser changed his mine as it was suggested to him to adopt another course with a view to ruin this foundation which was liked by the Government ana agreed upog. by us ana he arranged for a committee most of whose members are against this policy. Such being the case it is very difficult for us to do anything in the matter though we did what was to be cone by us as it is incumbent upon us to carry out your honour’s orders. Similarly when the Adviser asked us by your direction to persuade tne people to remove the uneasiness J from their minds in connection with the Arms question, ue called the headmen of the villages anc they are now hastening for registering their arms without any anxiety.

I regret that it is impossible for me to discard the rules and regulations laid down for the Agency Courts, and therefore I am unable to agree to the proposal now made. Suits can only be filed without prior payment of court fees in case of paupers, and of course if the minors Department were to wish to file a suit in the case of a oauper I should be perfectly agreeable to such a suit being made in forma pauperis. And of course I should accept without question the certificate of the Minors Department that the minor in question was in fact a pauper. In other cases where the minor*s estate is of reasonable value, it is necessary for court fees to be paid. 3. I find it a little difficult to understand the first paragraph of the letter from the President of the Minors Department which was enclosed with your memorandum under reply. If by any chance it indicates that the Department has taken charge of the estates of foreign minors I must invite a reference to my predecessor*s letter to you. No. 241 dated the 1st July 1937. As there indicated, the estates of/-of foreign minors must come under the administration of the District Court and it is solely within the competence of that Court to decide whether it should invite the assistance or co-operation of the Bahrain f/inors Department.

I said that in general terms I thought that we might be able to give the proposed Department Letters of Administration under the terms of the Bahrain Order in Council. The Re sident was inclined to agree but hoped that there would not be another fiasco like the one in about 1931 when we had to withdraw a notice which had been issued in order to * D apply to foreigners some order of the Bahrain Government. The papers about this instance should be put up. 3. It is just possible that if the Department is started we might have two members on it to represent foreigners. 4.

As soon as the de- th of a foreigner - Shia or Sami - is reported hy the police, a Court ClerV is sent to the deceased T s house to tahe an inventory of the goods left hy him in the presence of one Policeman and one private individual. The house is locked and sealed an' the inventory is brought to the Court. Then a notice in 6 copies is issued inviting the claims, if any, against the deceased within a certain period - usually one month. ’Then all the claims are received, a date is fixed ^or the hearing and on the fixed date all the claims are sent to the Qadhis for decision. The Court always confirms the Qadhis T decision and there is no instance available in which the Qadhis 1 views or findings are dissented from. This is the .procedure when the deceased has left no will or the executor of the will. 3. Put if the deceased has made a will prior to his death and has appointed an executor of bus will, the procedure is different and simpler. The executor appears before the Court with the will and requests for letter of administration. The will is sent to the Qadhis for inspection and report whether it is a genuine one and in accordance with the Islamic law and when the Qadhis are satisfied with it and submit their report to tha'tpffect, the Court recognises the executor’s claim and all the deceased’s property is vested in him. Vo further steps are taben by the Court. It is now left to the executor to call for claims or settle them in any way he likes. K.B. Siddiq Has- n’s note on pae'e 4 will also throw light on the subject.4. T am not in favour of giving Letters of Adminis tration to the proposed Department as it would he a Bahrain Government Department and our granting letters of Administration to it would he tantamount to granting control to Bahrain Government over foreigners - a circum stance which, as far as I can ’understand, is against the letter and the spirit of the Bahrain Order-in-Council. Even from efficiency point of view the change is ot desirable as it is a common complaint among the people here that the cases in the B'hra'n Court tahe inestimably long time before their are settled while those in the Agency Court are settled rightaway. Ai-d there is a great amount of truth in this statement. 5. Does not drise. 6. I suggest that we better wait and see hov/ the proposed department runs. Tf it functions satisfactorily LJZL and upto our standard of Justice, we can Join it/as it would always be open to us to do so. But if it does not .ork effectively and efficiently I do not consider the change would be Justifiable. Hi ^ by** * fi *Letter No. 315/1358 dated 22nd Oct. 1939 from the Suptdt.
