It has been suggested that the R.A.F. Medical officer should act as quarantine Officer at Muharraq, but both general policy and the amount of air craft traffic at Muharraq will have to be further considered before we make any recommendation to P.R. \ in this instance both Bahrain Government and J.M. U . &lt;2A. had received prior intimation that the aircraft was expected, vide s.9 of 13/2-A, and, as long as we continue to receive such previous intimation,the alternative to using R.A.F. Medi cal Officer -is for the quarantine Clerk, who lives at Muharraq, to conduct the quarantine examination of aircraft passengers when q.M.O. is not available, as he does for steamer passengers. Some such scheme is urgently required for'no excuse ^ E ■ should be given R.A.F. to clear an aircraft without a proper examination by the quarantine (and passport) officials. The occupants of an aircraft should await the con venience of the*officials of the country in which it makes a landing, and in most, if not all, countries passport and quarantine officials are not permanently stationed at aero dromes. It is in fact, the duty of the aerodrome authorities to summon these officials and to ensure that they examine the occupants of an aircraft before allowing it to depart. Kay take this up with R.A.F. when we receive reply from Adviser. s.6 . File? No prior intimation of the arrival of this air- craft, vide s.l, serins to have been received. P.

These telegrams contains details of the anticipated arrival of flights, flight numbers, flight itineraries, names of crew and passengers, and some detail of instruction upon arrival: reporting to the customs department, passport medical officer.The file’s office notes, written by the Political Agent, Captain Hugh Dunstan Rance, his Assistant and others, give indication of an incident in late 1946 when there were breakdowns in telephone communication between RAF officials, customs house officials and employees at the Political Agency, on the event of an aircraft arriving at Muharraq airfield (f 7), in turn provoking further discussion (summarised in typewritten notes on f 23) on how best to manage the flow of information to various parties (customs, quarantine) in the event of new arrivals at Bahrain in future.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Commanding Officer, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Quarantine Medical Officer, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Passports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Quarantine</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00033d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
