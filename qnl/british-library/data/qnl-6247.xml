It appears that you actually received my instructions before the agreement was signed and it is not clear to me why you did not act on them. I should be glad if you would let me know your reasons. The non-receipt by you of the instructions was due to lack of secret telegraphic communication and some unexplained delay in air transit, but since you knew I had written to you it would have been advisable for you to have informed me of the non-arrival of the letter. 3. Of course, by no explanation can we deprive the Sheikh of his right to consult with the P.C.L. under the terms of his agreement - of which he has a copy - and so now you should inform the Sheikh that the P.C.L. have asked Mr. Lermitte to regularize the agreement with the Bank by an exchange of letters between themselves and the Sheikh.it bocpjne obvious thpt Shaikh Iteshid cons idem d a reduction in the period to be a point of honour.

Although a couple of weeks have passed since he received the letter, he sent no reply and 1 reminded him twice verbally, he stated that before sending a reply he wish®! t© discuss the matter with Mr. Keast. i informed Mr. iLeast accordingly anc he expressed his readiness to go and see the shaikh and asked me to go along with him. *e visited the shaikh on the 3rd September ana the question of the proposed leasing of a land for the Imperial *&gt;ank of Iran at Dubai was discussed. The Shaikh said he would not consider selling the land ana adhered to the previous proposals which he had made to Mr. Keast quoting as a precedent the agreement which he had made with Anglo-Iranian Oil company concerning the lease of a plot of land at fls.200/- per nionth and for a lesser period, i.e., 10 years. It was pointed out to the shaikh that his present terms are exhorbitant, that a bank is in no way comparable with an Oil company, ana that by the existence of a bank in uub&amp;i both he and his subjects would benefit considerably. The Shaikh said he will think over the matter and let us know his decision next day. 3. On the 4th September shaikh Rashid bin Sa*id came to the Agency where Mr. Keast awaited him. .shaikh Rashid said he wanted &amp;• know what terms the Manager was prepared to accept. Mr. Keast stated that if the Sia ikh was not agreeable at all to let the land free of rent, he considered a rent of ris.100/- per month quite reasonable compared with the rent of similar plots of land leased to local people, shaikh Rashid said he will consult his fether&amp;nd let us have his final reply next day. On the 5th September both he ana Mr. Ktast came to the Agency to discuss the matter furti er. ohaikh Rashid produced the agreement which his father haa concluded with the Anglo-Iranian Oil company and stated that everything depended on our senae of justice and fair decision. Mr. Keast adhered to Rs.100/- rent per month and agreed at the request of bhaikh Rashid to reduce the period to 20 years to confirm with the period of the banking agreement but stipulated that the final agreement was subject to the approval of his uondon office to whom he was going to refer the matter. This was agreed to and a reply to Folitical Officer, Trucial coast*s letter in this sense was prepared by the Shaikh and handed over to me and is enclosed herewith.

The main items imparted during the year from India have been T ea snd piecegoods* Towards the end of the year the demand for Indian pieeegeods gave place to a demand for Chines® piece goods* Mest of these, however, were paid far in Bembay. We have alfa been called upon to remit funds to Enst Africa against the impart of Japanese piecegoods* large quantities of tea were imported during the Gunmer for which no market has yet been found. This caused an acute shortage of ready fund* in the Bazaar which still prevails* We ^are pleased to report tin. t many of our customers have become interested in British and European goods and several of them have obtained Agencies for British Firms* Machinery and consumer goods have been the main items imported from The merchants are unanimously agreed upon the superiority of British piecegeeds but claim that the prices are much too high for local markets. the U.K. P.T*0THE IMPEL IAI BABE OP HIATT - 2 - 2 .

Dear Sir, As requested byjwe give below a brief resume of our activities during the year ending 31st December 19 1 +9. ^ The volume &amp;f trade in Dubai bazaar increased steadily throughout the year. This increase was mainly in imports from the U.K. and other Sterling Areacountries other than India. \ The turnover of British goods was seven times greater than during x the previous year. Trade with India maintained the same level at roughly Rupees 200,000 weekly. This figure, however, does not include imports which were paid for from merchants'own non-Resident accounts in India. We found that Japanrfese goods were again available from East Africa, Colombo and Singapore against Rupees or Sterling. — The large quantities of unsold tea to which we referred in our last SReport are still rotting in thibai Customs Yard and private godowns. a Cash was plentiful throughout the year and we seldom met with difficulty in obtaining payment of Bills. Gold smuggling reached an unprecetfdented peak during the Summer but we took no part in it. The method of repatriating the proceeds was for the merchants (all Hindus ) to employ^ women and girls who came to Dubai as travellers and were allowed to draw travelling allowances for their journeys. These allowances greatly exceeded the cost of one return trip between Bombay and Bubai and the resiciflue was taken by the employers when the travellers arrived. The range of commodities imported was much wider than during the previous year. P.T.O.Page 2. Su?ar, Wheat, Rice,Machinery and Government surplus vehicles were the main items purchased from the U.K.but consumei gooes an were alojfs imported in large quantities. British piecegoods are still considered to he to expensive. Ghee, Woollen blaniets, piecegoods and aromatic chemicals were imported from Holland and Italy against Sterling. Ancstralian foodstuffs increased in popularity and most of tne tinned Iruit^vermfceSi, Jam, wheat and flour came from that country.
