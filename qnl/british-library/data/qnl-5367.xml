I am informed by His fajesty* s Consul at Herman that there is no British subject resident at Bander Abbas to which port visits of Iranian warships are in any case extremely infrequent, fhe only suit1© British subject resident on this coast whom Major Lincoln can suggest for the task is the Officer in Charge, Cables and Mreless Limited lenjaa. But since that station is shortly to be closed down this suggestion is impracticable. £. I am in any case of the opinion that the proposal to re-establish a naval reporting station on this coast is open to grave objection.

With reference to your letter of the 10th December, No. W. 10071/68/50 on the subject of naval reporting at Bunder Abbas, I am directed by the S. of I S. for India to state that the amalgamatdm of the Consular districts of Bunder Abbas and Kerman, the acceptance of which by | the Persian Government was reported by i regularisation of what had already been the position in practice since the early part of 1931 when Major Boel was granted leave of absence and Mr. Richardson deputised for him in addition to his performing his own consular duties at Kerman. It is understood that the present position is that the Consul at Kerman spends six or seven months of the year, including the summer, at Kerman and the rest of the year at Bunder Abbas. While he is at Kerman, the Head Clerk carries out routine work of a clerical nature at Bunder Abbas where it is understood that a small office is maintained at what has hitherto been the No. M/N 4361/34 of the 16th No^ er/;?f ( concerning the present position as : ^ regards the reporting officer’s documents ‘A /S 7 V Sir R.

The enquiry in Admiralty ter 2800 5000 5 34 formerlyformerly held by the Consulate at Bunder Abbas, appears to be answered by the letter from the Government of India No . 26147/9/M. 0.3 - Books (N^D.) dated 6th December 1934, a copy of which was forwarded to the Foreign Office and the Admiralty under 1.0. printed letter/of the 4th January 1935, from which it will be seen that the secret naval reporting documents referred to therein have been withdrawn from Bunder Abbas. With regard to the proposal that some arrangement should be made to continue the reporting facilities at the ^&gt;ort, it will be observed that the G. of I. in their letter under reference enquire whether the Consul at Kerman is to be Naval Reporting Officer. There would appear to be no difficulty to his acting in this capacity for the/six months of the year during which he is at Bunder Abbas, but it seems doubtful whether he could usefully act in that capacity while he is at Kerman. Before arriving at any decision on this question, it seems desirable to ask the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for his views on the matter f - Vk copy of letter to Lieut. Col.

Sir R.Hoare has been endeavouring for some time to obtain the concurrence of the Persian Government in the definition of the Bushire district agreed upon by H.M.G., the Government of India, and the Resident, and has at last been notified of their acceptance of the proposal. The Persian Government have simplified the definition, however, so that the Commission will now read:- M Consul-General for the Governorate of the South Ports excluding the Governorate of Bandar Abbas”. The Persian Government have also accepted 2730 1000 4.34 the proposal that was put to them at the same time/time that the Consular district of Bandar Abbas should be added to the Consular district of Kerman. Here again the Persians have modified the definition that was proposed ( vide P.Z.137/34, flag P) partly with a view to simplification. They have, however, also excluded the Governorate of Persian Baluchistan from the proposed district. This region has been excluded presumably on the ground that it is a military district. The reason given by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, however, was that the region had never before been included in any Consular district. This, as Sir R.Hoare points oij,t, is not true and he has private.^ pointed the fact out to the‘M^rPsA* The definition of Captain Lincoln*s new district will be:- 'The Governorate -General of Kerman and the Governorate of Bandar Abbas”. Doubtless the Foreign Office will prepare new Commissions on these lines. SEEN MLfTICAL OOMMITTKfeKo. 517# British Legation, Gulhek. 29th June, 19M. Sir, I have the honour to inforis you that I have at length heen notified by the Persian Government of its acceptance of the proposed amalgamation of the nonsular Districts of Kerman and Bandar Abbas which X proposed in )3J, »y note Ro. 228 of hay 6th 1933, a copy of which was 3'^ transmitted to you under cover of my despatch No. 218 of May 6th. — I have the honour to enclose a copy of the relevant paragraph of the note, fro® which it will be seen that, while accepting the general amalgamation, the Persian Government state that they are unable to allow the district of Persian Baluchistan to be included. This refusal has, no doubt, been reached on the same grounds as those on which Persian Kurdistan is excluded fro® the Consular districts, Persian Baluchistan being like Kurdistan, a military district. I understand that His Majesty’s Government admit this right of Foreign Governments to exclude foreign Consuls from having jurisdiction in certain areas, provided there is no discrimination. As the non-inclusion of Baluchistan in the district is unlikely to have any practical disadvantages I propose not to contest the Persian Government's amended definition, although this violates the principle of including the whole of any given country in the jurisdiction of one or other of His Majesty's Consular Officers residing in that country. X am, however, drawing the attention of the The light Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.8.I., etc., ©tc., etc., /Ministry The Foreign Office.Ministry privately to the fact that in 1927 the 'oyal Comission of Mr. J.H.

The Persian Government have tacitly admitted that there is no objection to the Governorate of Bandar Abbas (which comes for administrative purposes under the Governor of the Southern Ports) being included in the area of His Majesty* s Consul at Kerman, and the slightly cumbrous definition originally proposed in my note under reference is t herefore no longer necessary. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Ho. 159), to the Honourable the Political. Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 125) and to His Majesty 1 s Consul, Kerman (Wo. 24). I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

The Imperial Government agree to the first part of the proposal which Your Excellency made in your note No* 228 of the 16th Grdibehesht 1312 (6th l ay 1955) namely that the Consular district of Bandar Abbas he amalgamated with the British Consular district of Kerman, hut they cannot agree to the addition of the district of the Governor of Baluchistan to the Consular district in question, owing to the fact that the district of the Baluchistan Gove mo rate has never been included in any Consular district, and inasmuch as no change has taken place there in respect of the protection of the interests of British subjects and British trade, there is no need to add the abovementioned district to the district of the British Consulate-General (sic) at Kerman.Enclosure No* 2 in Tehran despatch No. 517 of 1954. 29th June, 1934.

I am grateful that the majority of the questions mentioned in that note hare at last been settled in a satisfactory way* though the immense delays entailed caused a good deal of personal Inconvenience to the f’oneular officers involved. 3.

But in order to prove to you that the Imperial Government as recently as Parch 50th 1927 (Parvar- din 9th 1506) reco^iized this fact, i send you the accompanying extract /givinggiving the exact terms of the ling’s commission to Mr* J.H.Davies mad of the Imperial Kxequator.

There has, I am afraid, been some misunder standing here as regards the existing position of the Consul at Kerman. The Political Resident in paragraph 5 of his despatch ho •44-3., dated the 1st February 1931, of which a copy was sent to the India Office, stated that the Consul at Kerman was entirely under the Resident for all administra tive purposes, and suggested that, since the Consul had no concern at all with Persian Gulf questions, while the Resident was not much concerned with the affairs of internal Persia, the system might be altered, and the Consulate at Kerman placed direct ly under the Government of India in the same way as the Consul at 3ist a n. No orders appear to have been passed on this suggestion. It was thereioie presumed from the statement of the position quoted above and also from the fact that in the quarterly list of the Foreign and Political Department the post/© post is descrilDeci as Consul for Kerrnan and Persian Baluchistan and ex-officio assistant to the Political Besident, that this post was already under the superintendence of the Consul General. It now appears that that assumption was incorrect and we have ascertained from Powle that he does not wish Kerman to he placed under his superintendence, hut only Bandar Ah Das. The Government of India are therefore 0 _uite prepared to agree that his Consular superinten dence should extend to Bandar *ibhas work only. To J.G.

(K 10006/11/234) Dear Laithwaite, j i Allchin wrote to Crombie on January 4th, enclosing copies of two notes from our Legation at Tehran to the Persian Government about the Bushire and Kerman consular districts. So far as we know, no progress has yet been made towards settling the districts. I am writing to you now to take up a point, which we should have mentioned before, arising out of your official h. • * letter Ph 2056/33 of April 11th, 1933. As you know from ^ ^our letter of May 17th, 1933 (K 11764/1028/234), the ' ^Chancery at Tehran wrote to Busnire on September 25th, 1932, saying that there was no reason, so far as they were con cerned, why the Bandar Abbas part of the Kerman consular district should not be under the superintendence of Bushire. On March 16th, 1933, Busnire telegraphed to Delhi, suggest ing that action be taken for placing Bandar Abbas under their superintendence. On March 20th, the Government of India/ J. G. Laithwaite, Esq. , y RECO. POL. DEPT. INDIA OFFICEIndia telegraphed to the Legation at Tehran, saying that they agreed with the Resident that Bandar Albas, though excluded from his district, should, together with Kerman , be placed under his superintendence. They presumed that this would be arranged by His Majesty’s Government. We are at a loss to understand the sudden introduction by the Government of India of the reference to Kerman. Our view was, and is,that the Consul at Kerman should be under the superintendence of Busnire only in so far as the Bandar Abbas part of his future district is concerned, and incidentally we do not think it will be necessary to make any reference to this superintendence in his Commission, as the Legation say that the Persians have in the past taken the line that the question of superintendence does not in terest them or affect their dealings with the officer in question. As you may know, it is unusual for a full Consul to be under any consular superintendence at all; but we quite see the point, in this case, so far as Bandar Abbas is concerned. Perhaps/Perhaps you will he good enough, if you think it necessary, to explain the above position to the Government of India.URE If4 FOREIGN OFFICB / _i • - • aHtisli Petition, J Tebraa etn isss IbJHI* mnmXmv Im mntntr*, t tmv* the honour to inform rmv Higteest that Hi® Majesty 1 ® Qorowmmnt in the Uaitad Clngto® a®8lr«, fr®® matiras of economy t to amalgamate wiyit ai*# at praaaat the aaparat# Uonaular district® of Kerman and Bander oib'bas and to till® end nave instructed me to eee)i t&amp;e concurrence of tne Imperial CloYerament in a proposal tHat the Consular diatriet of Bander mbee shall he added to the present district of Mr* O.B* inooln, His Majesty*s Oonsul at - Kerman* no change will he necessary in the official designation of Mr* Lincoln* who will remain Mis Majesty’s Consul '’for Kerman 1 * • to agree upon a new definition of Mr. Lincoln's Consular district* and the definition which I hare the honour to his Highness Mlraa Mohamad All Khan feroughi.

In his despatch Mo. 101 of March 9th. 1931, Mr. Parr proposed \n that the vexed question of Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe’s comlssion and exequatur he left in suspense pending a definition of the powers of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Mr. Henderson’s despatch Mo. 225 of April 23rd approved this suggestion. 2* The reason for this delay was that at that time the Govern- orate of the Gulf Ports had heen placed under the Governor-General of Pars. This arrangement has, however, heen cancelled for some ^ time past (see Mr. Dodd’s despatch No. 496 of September 12th 1931) and I understand tiiatT it is unlikely to he revived. It is therefore legitimate, in my opinion, in examining the question to assume that the Governor will remain independent. 3 . I should explain that in the course of the discussions with the head of the Protocol Department that preceded the preparation of Mr. Parr’s despatch, Farrukh Khan had expressed the opinion that the description of the Bushlre district as* ’’The coasts and islands of the Persian Gulf, w heing within the dominions of Persia” might with advantage be replaced by: 'The Governorate of the Gulf Ports”. 4 . I must confess to some sympathy with this view, for though objection was taken to the proposal at the time on the ground that the area of jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Forts was not sufficiently The Bight Honourable Sir John Simon G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.2 bu liciently defined, our ora proposal/ seems to me vaguer still a *coast” being a geographical entity of very uncertain extent# 5 # I am at present engaged in trying to compile an up-to-date list of the administrative areas of Persia. The task is more formidable than mi |ht be supposed, but there appears to be little doubt that the Governor*ate of the Gulf Ports includes the sub divisions of Lingah, Lurestan and Bander Abbas and the ports of. CL. jack and Char bar. ”Lurestan u may not mean the whole of the area that we call 'Lureetan' and I will try to obtain further Inform- ation on this point# 6 # In these circumstances and in view of the appointment of Lieutenant-Colonel Powle to be His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, which will necessitate a decision regarding his Consular area at an early date, I venture to suggest that I should be authorised to approach the Persian Government on the following lines j The district of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire should be defined as 'The district of the Governor of the Gulf (or southern) ports, excluding the town and mainland district of Bander Abbas and the districts lying to the east of this town”# This arrangement* would have the advantage of bringing under the direct control of the Political Resident and Consul-General both Henjam and Kishm (including Basidu), which seems desirable if there is to be no permanent Consular Officer at Bander Abbas# It might be possible to add 'Boshti and Doshtistan” after ’’Gulf Ports” if this is part of the Governor’s title (see Mr. Dodd’s despatch Ho. 440 of August 18th 1931) though equally this be superfluous# 7* The Governor of Bander Abbas comes officially under the Governor of the Gulf Ports, but I am at present discussing unofficially with the Persian Government the prospects of amalgamatingamalgamating the present Conaular areas of Kerman and Bander Ahhas* As far as I can ascertain no objection to this will he raised hy the Persian Government and as a corollary they may he expected to raise no objection to the definition oi the Bushire Consulate-General area (which excludes the Bander Abbas district) which I have proposed above# The Question as to whether or not it will be desirable to place the Consul at Kerman officially under the superintendence of the Consul—General at Bushire in espect of Bander Abbas, JaskCharbar, can be considered later* It would not affect the description of their respective districts for the purposes of the Persian Government* 8 . I venture to express the hope that I may receive an early authorization to come to an agreement with the Persian Government somewhat on these lines, and I trust I may be given a free hand to make such minor alteration^in the text of the definition ae may prove necessary if further information comes to light regarding the administrative divisions of South Persia.

After soma little ciomission he appeared gemiinoly to realise that this was quite a eu so nab la point of view end thou^t that ou:r wishes could bo siet. 9. In so far m the Persian Govemment have any definite on these subjects I fancy that they object to a ^eat satrapy such as the Consular w dietrlct n of imshire which 1 have mentioned above; therefore they rule it out by saying that no 'district*’ can contain more recognised consular Of fleers than a Coaaul-Oeneral # a Consul and a vice-consul. $3k&amp; argument that a Consul-General, superintending other Consuls is a recognised institution would not move them and n they would merely say that we are naturally at liberty to entrust any consular official with supervisory ^powers for our own administrative purposes but ouch powers cannot include any reco^iition of his rir^t to deal with the local Vr authorities in the district of his supervised Consuls. From this attitude it would &amp;c almost impossible to move them. 10. If in view of the foregoing considerations you arc disposed to agree that no essential principles arc involve I think that difficulties are less likely to recur if Consular Coftitiiscions henceforth only Indicate the officer’s headquarters and not the extent of his district which would be mentioned in the note asking for the exequatur. This would facilitate any redistribution of districts necessitated by the modification of Persian Govornorates, which is a fairly frequent phenomenon, or by our own convenience. 11 . in view of the terms of your despatch under reply.

My Lord Marquess, With reference to Mr. Charles Lodd*s despatch Ho. 498 of September 14th last I have the honour to transmit to Tour Lordship herewith a copy of a further note from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding the consular district of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ramadan. g. The not® vouchsafes no reason for the refusal to include Garrous in this Jurisdiction. But the reason is probably similar to that recently put forward by the Ministry for excluding foreign consular officers from Kurdistan, on whose confines Garrous lies (please see Ifr# Dodd’s despatch Ho. 479 of the 8th September). I presume that this refusal mat be accepted and I do not consider that in practice any disadvantage will be entailed. 3. The refusal to issue a revised exequatur has no aetd&amp;l importance, since Mr. Vice-Consul Gummerhayes is now under orders to leave Hamadan for Shiraz (see Your Lordship’s telegram Ho. 163 of the g?th October) and the Vice-Consulate will be closed pending the appointment of a successor. The permanent closure of this post is, furthermore, under consideration (see Gir H,Clive’s despatch Mo. 311 of the 13th June). Consular Jurisdiction in the district in question will, ho ever, have to be assigned to ; ome consular post and the designation of the district as The Most Honourable now The Marquess of heading G.C.B., etc., etc., etc.. The Foreign Office.now s .notioned by the Persian Government should be noted for Inclusion in any Royal Commission issued to the incumbent of the post eventually selected. The desi^pa&amp;tion is 'The Province of Kamadan, the districts of Malay or f Tousser- kan and Hahavand, know as the Triple Governorate, and the district of Assa&amp;abad'.

In reply, I have the honour to inform you that the matter was referred to the competent quarters and the question of the extension of the said area of jurisdiction over the places mentioned above with the exception of G&amp;rrous has eventually been agreed to.

With regard to the renewal of the exeauatur of Mr. hummerhayes, the British Vice-Consul in Hanadan mentioned in your note under reply, I have to state that, as point out in the note Ho. 15575/71012330 of Mordad 27th 1310 (August 19th 1931) t the renewal of exequaturs is not customary end that introduction of this officer to the Governors of the above places would be sufficient.

Sir, I have had under consideration your despatch No. 6/5 of the 2nd Novemher last relative to the Consular district of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Hamadan. In view of the fact that it has been decided to close the post permanently no useful purpose would be served by proceeding further with the recognition of Mr. Vice-Consul Summerhayes’ extended district. 2. With regard, however, to the intention of the Persian Government to refuse an exequatur for the district of Garrous I consider it desirable that the matter should be dealt with on the lines suggested in my despatch No. 716 of the 7th ultimo. 3. You should therefore take a suitable opportunity of proposing to the Persian Government that the Garrous district should be included in the Commission of His Majesty’s Consular Officer who, on the closure of the present Vice- Consulate at Hamadan, will be appointed to superintend the area at present assigned to that post and that they should formulate a reservation with regard to that district when issuing the exequatur. I am, etc., (For the Secretary of State) (Signed) ERNEST F. GYE. R.H. Hoare, Esq., C.M.G., etc., etc., etc., Tehran.COPY V (K 11981/874/234) No. 496 ♦ I British Legation, Tehran. 12th September, 1931. My Lord Marquess, With reference to my despatch No. 440 of August 18th regarding the reorganisation of Consular districts in South Persia, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith, a copy of a despatch on the same subject which I have now received from the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. You will observe that as regards the main question at issue, namely the severance of the Province of Pars from the district of His Majesty’s Consul General, Major Powle is in general agreement with the conclusions reached in the despatch under reference to the effect that severance is desirable. 2. There remains the problem of Laristan; it cannot be denied that from some points of view it would be desirable to include this area in the district of the Consul-General, and if there were no question of the susceptibilities and prejudices of the Persian Government I should on the whole be in favour of doing so, thereby rounding off this district and avoiding a projecting enclave . I have, however, every reason to fear that any such proposal would lead to still further difficulties with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, on whose obstructive attitude in the matter of the Kermanshah and Hamadan districts The Most Honourable The Marquess of Reading, G.C.B., etc., etc., etc., 1 / The Foreign Office.5./ I shall report separately. There is little doubt but that they would insist on the inclusion of Larestan, which is administratively subordinate to the Governor-General of Pars, in the district of His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, and in that event much time would inevitably be wasted before this question could be finally settled. 3 . X propose, therefore, that the district of Larestan should not be mentioned in the new Royal Commission which is being prepared for Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe, and that it should be included in the next Royal Commission made out for an incumbent of His Majesty’s Consulate at Shiraz. The description of Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe’s district would therefore be, if the suggestion made in paragraph two of Mr. Parr’s despatch TTo. 101 of March 9th were adopted, 'The Coasts and Islands of the Persian Gulf, being within the Dominions of Persia, including the District of Lingah”: while that of the district of His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz would be 'The Provinces of Pars and Larestan”. 4. It will probably be desirable, if Your Lordship approves these proposals, to s ecure the prior agreement of the Persian Government to the changes which they involve and the precise designations adopted, before new Royal Commissions are made out. This will reduce the danger of Exequaturs being refused for the new districts and the Royal Commissions in which the districts are set forth being rendered useless, as in the case of Kermanshah. In this connection it should be borne in mind that a new Royal Commission may be required before long for Shiraz, owing to the fact that Mr. Trott is taking up the duties of acting Oriental Secretary at this Legation.5. I should at the same time propose to obtain the agreement of the Persian Government to the description of the district of His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz as ’’The Provinces of Khuzistan and Luristan”. The point has not yet been raised as, owing to the absence of Mr. Gybbon-Monypenny on leave, there has been no occasion to send to the Persian Government the Royal Commission for this officer enclosed in Mr. Henderson's despatch No. 360 of June 29th (K 2218/2/250) 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India, and to the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have, etc., (For His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires) (Sd) Lacy Baggallay.C onf J lential . No. 126/517-S of 1931. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the 21st August 1931. I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 60 of May 6th 1931, regarding the allocation of more definite consular districts in South Persia. 2. In that despatch you requested me to let you have my observations on certain points in about 2 months time. At that period the Persian Government had - some months previously - made a new experiment in their administration of South Persia by making the Governor of the Gulf Ports, v/hose headquarters are at Bushire, subordinate to the Governor-General at Pars, whose head quarters are at Shiraz (vide Colonel Biscoe f s despatch No. '76-S of 25th February 1931 to the Government of India). 3. This change, as pointed out by Mr. Parr in paragraph 4 of his letter No. 101 of 9th March 1931 to the Foreign Office, greatly complicated the issue, and Colonel Biscoe’s suggestion - that the question should remain in abeyance for some months - (vide paragraph 3 of his despatch already quoted) was approved of. 4. Since the receipt of your despatch of May 6th a new Governor has been appointed to Bushire, and there have been rumours that he was to be independent of Shiraz, as formerly. I thought it better to wait, however, before addressing/ H.B.M.’s Charge d f Affaires, British Legation, Tehran.addressing you on the subject, until this return to the old procedure had been finally established and until there seemed no likelihood of further changes, a precaution which seemed necessary in view of the fact that the present Persian Government seem partial to administrative experiments. 5. The Governor here, however, has now definitely informed me that he is independent of the Governor-General of Pars, and directly under Tehran, and as far as I can judge this is likely to continue. This has been, to the best of my knowledge, the arrangement for many years past, with the exception of the short period occupied by the new experiment, and as the latter has not presumably proved a success there does not seem much chance of a return to it. This being so the question of the Consul-General, Bushire f s exequatur can, I think, be safely taken up on the basis that the present administrative arrangements by the Persian Government will continue. 6. Colonel Biscoe (vide paragraph 2 of his despatch No. 44-S of 1st February 1931 to the Government of India) stated that, on certain conditions, he had no objection to the exclusion of Pars and Khuzistan from the consular district of the Consul-General, Bushire. This being so, and as Bushire area from the Persian administrative point of view, will now be independent of Pars, the latter province with Khuzistan could presumably be excluded from his exequatur. 7. With regard to Laristan. As Mr. farr points out this is a particularly wild and backward province, in which British interests are at present negligible. Administra tively it is under Shiraz, but as it abuts on Lingah and Bandar Abbas, which are under the Governor of Bushire, it might/might he more convenient to include it - if possible - under the exequatur of the Consul General, Bushire. Against this, however, there is the difficulty mentioned in the beginning of paragraph 4 of Mr. Parr’s despatch. 8. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India, and to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. I have, etc., (Sd) T.C.W.

My Lord Marquess With reference to Mr. Henderson^ despatch ! No. 360 of June 29th (K 2218/2/250) enclosing a Royal Commission appointing Mr. H.A.D. Hoyland to be His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah, I have the honour to report that I applied on July 22nd for an Exequatur recognising Mr.Hoyland’s district as the Province of Kermanshah, Kurdistan and Pushti- Kuh. I have now received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs a note, of which I enclose a copy, stating that the Persian G-overnment are unable to accept a Consular Officer in respect of Kurdistan and asking that the Royal Commission, which they return, may be amended accordingly. The note is somewhat obscurely worded, but I have ascertained that so far as the Province of Pusht-i-Kuh is concerned, the request for its inclusion in Mr. Hoyland’s district is not definitely refused. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs prefer, however, that a fresh application to this effect, omitting all reference to Kurdistan should be addressed to them. 2. I assume that the Persian Government is within its rights in declining to recognise a Consular Officer for Kurdistan. This attitude of the Persian Government is perhaps not unreasonable, as the presence of Soviet or Turkish Consuls in Kurdistan, or even their official connexion with that province, might be embarrassing. So far as I am aware there are no British subjects resident in Kurdistan and the only/ The Most Honourable The Marquess of Reading G.C.B., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Officeonly contingency that might arise is the capture or murder of some casual British traveller. Such a case would in any case have to he taken up by the Legation with the Central Authorities and the only drawback would be that some difficulty might be experienced if it were desired to depute His Majesty's Consul, who would be the nearest British official, to investigate the facts on the spot. As regards the reports which His Majesty's Consul furnishes upon conditions in Kurdistan, their value will not be affect ed, as he has practically no opportunities of going there. 3. I presume that in the circumstances Your Lordship will not wish me to dispute the point about the Province of Kurdistan with the Persian Government but will wish me to address a further note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the Province of Pusht-i-Kuh. In the meanwhile I return Mr. Hoyland's Royal Commission, in order that when the designation of the district is finally settled a new Commission may be issued. 4.

In reply, I have to state that the area of jurisdiction of this official as mentioned in the Commission is to cover Kennanshah, Kurdistan and Pusht-i-Kuh whereas in the note of Aban 24th, 1309 (November 15th 1930) from His Majesty’s Legation Mr. Hoyland has been introduced as Consul for Kerman shah and that, as mentioned in the reply No.23068/702 of Azer 10th 1309 (December 1st 1930), he was temporarily recognised in that capacity by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs pending the receipt of the said Commission of appointment. Mr. Cowan, his predecessor was also introduced and recognised as Consul for Kermanshah only. As Kurdistan and Pusht-i-Kuh do not form part of the area of jurisdiction of the Governor of the Kermanshah district and that the Imperial Government do not, in principle, accept a Consular Officer in Kurdistan and that they (the Persian Government do not recognise Kurdistan as coming within the district of jurisdiction of a Consular Officer residing in another district and that the affairs relating to foreign subjects residing in Kurdistan are being dealt with through diplomatic channel (the Legation in Tehran), the Commission of/of appointment is sent “back herewith with a request that you may cause necessary corrections to he made therein and send it back to this Ministry for the issue of an exequatur.

Hou&amp;h to be His Majesty’s Consul-General at Constantinople, together with a request for the grant of an exequatur to enable him to act in his official caoacity. 2. I have now received frora the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a note, of which a copy is enclosed herein, returning the commission and pointing out that among the vilayets mentioned as being within r. Hough’s consular jurisdiction there occur the military zones of Qatalca and Izrnit. The Ministry draws attention to the fact that such jurisdiction cannot apply to military zones, and requests that a new commission be submitted mentioning only the actual seat of the Consulate-General, the consular district being described in the covering note requesting the issue of an exequatur. 3. This is not the first time that the Ministry have made reserves in respect of military zones mentioned in the King’s Commissions appointing consular officers to posts in Turkey, but since the issue of an exequatur took the place of the visa formerly endorsed on the commission itself the Turkish practice has been merely to omit from the exequatur the mention of those vilayets which were included in forbidden/ ^he ^ight Honourable, Arthur Henderson, r V'. , etc. , etc., etc.,forbidden zones. It would seem that this procedure has been discontinued in order to enable the Turkish authorities to make modifications in such zones in the future without the necessity for modifying the exequaturs issued to foreign consular officers. 4. do far as I am concerned, I have no objection to the proposed new procedure, but a member of my staff has pointed out to the competent official of the Ministry for Foreign Affaire that some difficulty in following it might arise from the fact that It was the normal practice for His Majesty to issue such commissions only in cases where a consul had a definite district assigned to him. 5. I have the honour to return Mr. Hough’s commis sion herewith, and should be grateful for your instructions as to what reply should be returned to the Ministry’s request. I have, etc., (Sd) GFORGK R.

Consul-General Hough’s appointment, and that the new Commission should mention only the actual seat of the Consulate-General, the consular district being described in the covering note requesting the issue of an exequatur. 2, As you are aware, ail salaried consular officers, whether superintending or subordinate, are now appointed by Royal Commission* In the case of subordinate officers no consular district is mentioned, and they are merely appointed to the nost under the superintendence of a senior officer. Tut in the case of a senior officer it is the invariable practice of Hie Majesty’s Government that the area assigned to him as his consular district shall be specified in the King’s Commission by virtue of which he performs his duties. 3. It is, moreover, the general practice of His Majesty’s Government to include so far as possible the whole territory of a country within the districts assigned to His Majesty’s Consular Officers appointed to reside in that (country. It is important that, if any event affecting British interests should occur in any part of that country, it should fall within the competence of one of his tajesty’s Consular/ Ho. 360.

I see no necessity to depart from the usual practice of His Majesty’s Government, as described above, on account of the wish of the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs to make reserves in respect of military zones. The fact that a district mentioned in a Consular Officer’s coiamlssion may contain such military zones does not in any case imply any claim to disregard or override the laws and regulations regarding such zones. I shall therefore be glad if you will explain to the Turkish authorities concerned that I prefer to continue the practice of describing in the Commission it self the consular district assigned to each consular officer, and am of opinion that the wishes of the Turkish Government could be adequately met if they were to make a general reserve, in the case of military zones, when Issuing the exequatur. 5.

It will be seen from the first of these eaclosnres that while the province of barest an is under the Juris* diction of the Governor-General of Far®, the district of Lingafc is directly under the control of the Governor of the Gulf ports. At first sight.therefore, it would seem best that harestan should be included in the consular district of His majesty’s Consul at Ghiraa, (whose loyal Commissi©a would therefore be made out for the provinces of Far® and larostan), while the district of His Majesty*® Consul- General at Bushire should be defined as ''Phe Coasts and Islands of the Persian Gulf being within the dominions of Persia , including the District of Lingah'’. # 5. haresttan, it may be noted, is a particularly wild and b&amp;oKVvard province in which, I understand, .British interests are a present negll* ,ib e and are likely to re mail so for some years to eo *6.

If Parn , (with Larastan) were to be left a ter all in his consular area, the Ministry for Foreiga ffairs would pr-MSumably refuse, fur the reasons which they have already riven, to issue him with the corresponding exequatur, on the other hand I agree with him that unless it be found in practice that the Governor of the Gulf porta enjoys &amp; large measure of independence via-a-vis of the ;ovornor-aeaer&amp;l in rhiraz it is undesirable that the Consul-General should be debarred from, corresponding officially with the latter. Colonel Siscos, you will observe, suggests that the question should remain in abeyance for the next few months until the real -position of the Governor becomes clearer. I also feel the t this would be the wisest course. The exequatur already issued to him by the .Persian Government is still being retu.hied at this Legation, und it is possible that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs may enquire why it has not been submitted to the local authorities. In that case I propose, subject to your concurrence, t &gt; reply that m the exequatur does not tally with the Hoyal Cowls ion, the matter is being examined by your :apartment, acre especially in the light of the changes introduced by the Per si an Government t begs selves since these documents were issued. 5. in conclusion I venture to draw your attention to an oversight in paragraph 6 of the enclosure to your despatch— —-3- despatch under reference : the district to be ae^igiied to His n&amp;jesty's Consul at Ahwas is, of course, ?, Lurestan !

A further report by the Political Resident in the light of the views expressed by the India Office on P. 8588/30 is now submitted. The Resident’s conclusions are, briefly, as follows:- (a) In present political conditions in Persia, and subject to the caveat that the collapse of the Central Government might necessitate reconsideration, Colonel Biscoe, as before, sees no objection to the exclusion of T;, ars and Khuzistan from thedistrict 'of the Consul-General, Bushire, provided that the Resident is allowed to proceed to Shiraz on duty in the summer, and that he is allowed to visit hohammerah for discussion with the Vice-Consul there on M the many Indian and Gulf questions that arise”. He emphasises that it is important that the exclusion of these Provinces from his district 'should in no way affect the degree of co operation and consultation on matters of common concern which at present exist between the Resident and' the Consular Officers at Ahwaz and Shirajf; (b) it appears that the Consul at Kerman is at present entirely subordinate to the Resident for all administrative purposes, but so far as political work - ■ ■ Tr trr goes, has for practical purposes no dealings with Bushire. Subject possibly to the clerical establishment at * \ x Kerman continuing to be found .from the Persian Gulf cadre, the Resident sees no objection to the Kerman Consulate being entirely independent of Bushire in future, and dealing direct with the Government of India in all administrative matters; (c) Colonel Biscoe is o^ opinion that the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz . whose position, for the reasons explained in paragraph 7 of the despatch, is rather special, should remain 'under Bushire for purely administrative purposes, as at present. He further recommends that, as in the case of Abhammerah, the Resident should be authorised to visit Ahwaz on duty; (d) Colonel Biscoe sees no objection to an immediate decision on the above lines. So long as the local authorities and the Government of India (who are perhaps 'unlikely to differ from the Resident are satisfied with the revision proposed, there is no reason for/Minute Paper. Department. for us to criticise it. Prima facie . it has much to commend it. As for the date from which it is to take effect, one would have, thought that there might be some advantage in dealing with consular reorganisation in connection with the transfer of the Residency. But the two subjects are not essentially linked, and if the Government of India agree with the Resident/fwe can proceed ■'•lerr^to give effect to the proposed re organisation. ?

In that telegram His fajesty*s minister s tated that he proposed to forward to me the exequatur already issued by the Persian Government, the scope of which tallied with the amended Consular District which he proposed. 3. If the exequatur referred to is that, a translation of which was forwarded to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under cover of Sir Robert Olive’s despatch No. 375, dated 2nd August 1930, then I would venture to point out that I am therein merely recognised as Consul-General in Bushire. I recommended that ray consular jurisdiction should be coincident with that of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, whose official designa- Governor tion is of the Persian Gulf Ports and Islands, Dashti and Dashtis tan (Hukumut-i-Banadi r wa Jazayir Khali j Iran Dashti wa Dashtistan J.

K ■n /hri2 Please see previous submission on P. 7161/30. The Political Resident’s proposals are given in his despatch to Tehran of 7th October on P. 8167. The Foreign Office letter of 11th December now submitted covers the views of the Minister at Tehran on those proposals. Broadly speaking, the Resident, the Minister and the Foreign Office are now in line as to X the action to be taken. The main point outstanding is the position of the Indian Political Department Vice-Consul at Ahwaz. I understand from the Consular Department rf the Foreign Office that, so long as Ahwaz remains technically within the Consul-General’s district, that official would be entitled technically to issue instructions to the Vice-Consul. Once the rearrangement now proposed takes effect, it-would tset be the case. We are not very clear as to the precise relations between the Vice-Consul and the Resident at the present time, and it will be desirable to put the point to the Government of India, and to ask them to consider whether they think there is any case for a special arrangement at Ahwaz similar to that which the Foreign Office are prepared to agree to at Mohammerah. A separate point for considerat ion is whether it would not be better to let this reorganisation wait until the question of the transfer of the Residency is settled, when a general reorganisation of Consular districts in South Persia and the Gulf will have to be considered. We shall not know where we stand as regards this until we get the Foreign Of*-fi r&gt; p / 4793.4 5000 10 30Office reply to a letter which has been separately submitted, forwarding the Government of India’s proposal that we should go slow for the present as regards transfer.

Vice-Consul there may consult him on questions of purely Indian concern and matters appertaining to the Persian Gulf. No reference is, however, made in the correspondence to the position of the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, who is at present found from the Indian Political Department. The Secretary of State is not very clear as to the precise relations which at present exist between/ / the Political Resident in his capacity of Consul-General, Bushire, and the Vice- Consul at Ahwaz, and he would be glad to receive a report on the position, together with the views of the Government of India on the question whether, if the Foreign Office proposals are accepted, it will be desirable to make any specilal provision similar to that contemplated in the case of Mohammerah, to govern the relations of the Consul-General, Bushire, with the Vice-Consul, Ahwaz. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, together with a copy of the foreign Office letter of 11th 'December referred to above. (Sd.) J. C.

Foreign Office, S.W.l. 11th December, 1950, Sir, y 11 O i * L O uj LU ^ Q CO With reference to your letter No.P.8167/30 of November 25th, I am directed hy Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit to you for the information of the Secretary of State for India the accompanying copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran regarding the question of consular districts in Southern Persia. 2. It appears from this telegram and from the correspondence, copies of which were enclosed in your letter under reference, that Sir Robert Clive and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf are of opinion that the provinces of Pars and Khuzistan should he excluded from the Bushire consular district, hut that the Bundar Ahhas consular district should continue to he included in the jurisdiction of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire. 3. Mr. Henderson concurs in these views, and is prepared to agree that the Resident should, as suggested, continue to reside during certain periods at Shiraz on duty and to visit Mohammerah, in order that His Majesty’s Vice- Consul there may consult him on questions of purely Indian concern and matters appertaining to the Persian Gulf. 4. Since the post of His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz has been filled from the Levant Consular Service, that officer has normally taken his instructions from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. The administration of the Indian Code hy His Majesty’s Consul under the Persian Coasts and Islands Orders in Council may in the past have afforded some justification for including his district in the definition j The Under-Secretary of State, j i 2 i ’ 6 o 2 1 ; &amp; rj &lt; !.«J O ’ India Office.definition of the district assigned to the Resident as Consul- General; hut now that, with the abolition of the Capitulations, these Orders in Council have ceased to he operative, Mr. Henderson considers that this departure from established practice should he regularised and that the status of the Consulate at Ahwaz, as an independent post subordinate only to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, should he recognised in the definitions of the consular districts concerned. 5. The district allotted to His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz is at present described as ”Shiraz”, whereas in practice the sphere of his work extends over the whole province of Pars and is in no way limited to the town and immediate neighbourhood of Shiraz. He receives instructions, as Mr. Benn is aware, from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and is, in practice at any rate, entirely independent of the Political Resident. It is therefore only logical that the province of Pars should be excluded from the theoretical sphere of authority of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire and should be assigned to His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz as his consular district. 6. Mr. Henderson proposes therefore, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India, (1) that His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz should in future be described in his commission as His Majesty’s Consul for the Provinces of Khuzistan u and L^ristan, as recommended by Sir Robert Clive ~ &gt;j in his despatch No.254 of the 12th June last, a copy of which was transmitted to the India Office in Foreign Office letter No. K 7611/7611/234 of the 17th July; (2) that the officer to be appointed to fill the present vacancy at His Majesty’s Consulate at ShirazShiraz should receive a commission describing him as His Majesty’s Consul for the Province of Pars to ^ reside at Shiraz; (3) that a new commission should he issued to Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe as His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire, containing a definition of his district, which would not include the provinces assigned to His Majesty’s Consuls at Ahwaz and Shiraz. A copy of a despatch inviting Mr. Parr’s views on the exact form which this definition should take is enclosed herein. 7. I am to add that, in Mr. Henderson’s view, the adoption of these proposals should in no way effect the degree of co-operation and consultation on matters of common concern which at present exists between the Resident and the two other officers in question, and he would propose that instructions to that effect should be issued to them. 8. The Secretary of State would be glad to learn whether Mr. Benn concurs in the course proposed. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant,—COPY. o (K 12393/1939/234) NO DISTRIBUTION. Decypher. Sir 'r.

Resident has no objection to exclusion of Pars and Khuzistan from his consular district provided he be allowed as before to (? grp. undec.) on duty at Shiraz and visit Mohammerah for the purpose of advising vice-consul on Indian and Persian Gulf questions. He strongly presses continued inclusion of Bunder Abbas district, Governor of which is Governor General of Gulf ports. I concur in his recommendations and propose subject to your approval to forward to him exequatur issued by Persian government scope of which tallies with amendment of consular district which he proposes. In that event it might be well to take up with Persian government general question of inadvisability of their pretention to dictate scope of our consular districts apart from specific cases of Bushire. Resident believes that he can carry on if necessary without exequatur for the present. Addressed to Foreign Office No.259, repeated to Bushire No.121.- Colonel Biscoe’s proposals:- ( (a) No objection to transfer of Moharamerah from his jurisdiction so long as 'for the remainder of the period that, the Resident remains in Persia' he may visit hohammerah and the Vice-Consul may consult him on 'Indian, maritime, Gulf and cognate questions'. Xc». NX***ki; Charge -d 1 -Aff a ires agrees; so does the Foreign Office. It will probably be necessary, in replying to the Foreign Office, to enter a caveat as to the position of the Resident in regard to Mohammerah after transfer has taken place, but it is unnecessary to put this to the Government of India. tk CU. jfVV' t}&gt; a.'Lyfin.) (b) Ahwaz : The Resi dent(makes no comment on the exclusion of Ahwaz from his Consular district. The Foreign Office propose to establish the Consulate as an independent post, subordinate only to Tehran (this being in practice its present position). This is unobjectionable so long as the Government of India are satisfied that no special provision is required to cover the position of the Indian Political Department Vice-Consul at Ahwaz. We do not know quite in what relation this officer at present stands to the Resident. It might be desirable to establish in his case also a convention similar to that which the Foreign Office are prepared to accept in respect of Mohammerah. The point can be put to the Government of India. (c) Bander Abbas : The Resident is opposed to its transfer to the Kerman Consular district, and considers 'that my Consular jurisdiction should most certainly extend along the Persian Gulf littoral from the limits of Khuzistan as far as the Persian frontier'. The Minister concurs; so do the Foreign Office. (d) Shiraz : Colonel Biscoe has no objection to the (and Fars) exclusion of Shiraz/from his district, on the understanding 'that/'that no objection will be taken to his proceeding to Shiraz on duty in the summer should he desire to do so'. The Charge d f Affaires and the Foreign Office agree to this.

British Legation, G-ulheL, Octoher 2nd 1930, Sir , I have to inform you, with reference to ray despatch Ho, 105 of the 2nd August last, that I have now received a communication from His Majesty*s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which it is stated that the claim of the Persian Government to limit the districts of foreign consular officers in Persia cannot 'be admitted. 2. It is proposed that His Majesty* s Government in Great Britain and the Government of India should decide together as to the proper extent of your consular district. Mr. Henderson therefore intends to discuss the question as soon as possible with the Secretary of State for India hut Before doing so it will he necessary for him to he able to form an opinion as to whether a revision or a closer definition of your district is expedient. 3. In this connection the possibility of allocating separate and independent districts to Bushire, Ahwaz, Shiraz and Bandar Abbas will probably be considered, and I have been requested to submit my recommendations as regards the districts which might, under such a scheme, be allotted to each post. 4. In accordance with a previous recommendation, which I submitted to the Foreign Office in June last, the Ahwaz Consular district will include the provinces of Khuzistan and Luristan. I hold to the opinion that with the disappearance of the old Orders in Council Khuzistan should no longer be included in your district. The Shiraz Consular district might well in future include The Honourable Lieutenant Colonel H.V.Biscoe, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Majesty’s Consul-General, Bushire.include the province of Fare as the Governor General of the province resides at Shiraz, Again there are arguments in favour of subordinating Bander Abbas to His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman. 5. I shall be grateful if you will furnish me, by air mail, at as early a date as possible your views on these points. I shall further be glad to learn at the same time whether, pending the settlement of this question in London, you consider that you will be able to continue to carry out your duties without an exequatur in conf^gmity with your present Commission. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd. R.H.Clive.BY AIR MAIL No. 146/548-S of 1950 Confidenti al« British Residency and Consul&amp;te-Genefs Bushire, the 7th October 1930. # /1 Sir , I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch ITo. 150, dated 2nd October 1930, regarding my consular jurisdiction. 2. You therein suggest that Khuzistan, Bars, and possibly Bandar Abbas should be excluded from my consular jurisdiction. As regards Khuzistan I would mention that the Vice-Consulate at Mohammerah is entirely under this Residency for all administra tive purposes; the clerical establishment is borne on the Persian Gulf cadre; the budget is included in the Persian Gulf budget and all proposals regarding the administration of the post are submitted to me. The arrangement which has existed now for some time past and which has been concurred in by His Majesty’s Legation is that the Vice-Consulate at Mohammerah is formally under the Consulate at Ahwaz; he however consults the Political Resident and is generally guided by him in Indian, maritime, Gulf and cognate questions. A certain amount of correspondence is carried on with Mohammerah on these matters and I have visited the post occasionally during the past year, and on each occasion the Vice-Consul has sought my advice on certain matters coming within the above categories. I consider it desirable that this arrangement should be maintained for the remainder of the period that the Resident remains in Persia, but on the understanding that no objection will be raised to the Resident visiting Mohammerah and the Vice-Consul consulting the Resident on the matters referred to above, I see no H.B.M’s Minister, British Legation, Tehran. obj ectionobjection to this post not being technically within the area included in my consular district. 3. As regards Pars, the chief advantage at the present time is that the inclusion of Shiraz within the Consular-General's jurisdiction enables him to recess there occasionally in the summer) but if it be clearly understood that no exception will be taken to his proceeding to Shiraz on duty in the summer should he desire to do SO) then I see no objection to the exclusion of Fare from my consular district. 4. As regards Bandar Abbas I am not aware of the arguments in favour of putting it under Kerman unless it is that the trade of Kerman passes through Bandar Abbas, ihis argument would seem to have little weight and might equally be advanced as an argument in favour of putting Shiraz unuer the supervision of Bushire since all the trade of that province passes through Bushire. There are however in my opinion the strongest possible arguments for retaining Bandar Abbas under Bushire. Firstly, the present day tendency is to make consular districts coincide as closely as possible with Persian administrative areas, ihe Deputy Governor of Bandar Aboas is subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf ports. Therefore if any incident occurs in Bandar Abbas the normal procedure is for the Deputy Governor of that place to report the incident to the Governor of the Gulf ports. The result of the proposal would be that whereas the Persian authorities at Bandar Abbas would approach Theran thiough Bushire, ttoxStoKXKJPj: the British Consul at that place would approach Tehran thr Kerman s surely a very anomalous arrangement. Further, Hen jam is within the Bandar Abbas district and the exclusion of Bandar Abbas from the Consul-General's area would mean that the multifarious incidents that are constantly cropping up would have to be reported not to the Resident but at Henjamto the Consul at Bandar Abbas who in turn would refer the matter to the Consul at Kerman, who would refer them to the minister, questions connected with Henj&amp;m, Basidu, etc., are purely and entirely Gulf questions and you will, I am sure, agree that they should be dealt with by the Resident and not by the Consul at Kerman who is entirely unacquainted with local conditions. I may mention that various small incidents have occurred at Henjam recently which I have been able to get settled in direct correspondence with the Governor of the Gulf ports and regarding which I have not had to trouble you. Were Bandar Abbas excluded from my jurisdiction I should be at any rate technically wrong in interfering in such matters. Secondly, the effect of excluding Bandar Abbas from my juris diction v/ould be that that jurisdiction would not even be as extensive as the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf ports. I am of opinion that my consular jurisdiction should most certainly extend along the Persian Gulf litteral from the limits of Khuzistan as far as the Persian frontier. 5. You enquire whether, pending the settlement of this question in London, I shall be able to continue to carry out my duties without an exequatur in conformity with my present ports Commission. A month or so ago the Governor of the Gulf/asked me to send him my exequatur for registration. I informed him that I had not yet received it but would send it as soon as I did. there the matter rests for the present, and I do not anticipate that the Acting Governor will raise the matter again in the near future; but this of course I cannot guarantee. Should he do so, I can however of course give him the same reply, when he may possibly refer the matter to Teheran. 6.

The Persian Government have raised difficulties about recognising the present Political Resident as Consul- General for Pars, Laristan and Khuzistan, and have endeavoured to restrict his district to the area of the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The Foreign Office, while not prepared to admit a Persian claim to limit the districts of foreign consular officers, suggest that the opportunity should be taken to reach a decision as to the most suitable limits for the Consul- General's district before any final* communication on the subject is made to the Persian Government. They have accordingly, preparatory to discussing the question with this Office, asked Sir Robert Clive to examine the question with Colonel ,* lb 'lAKfCtor* *r Umcf &lt; &amp;/*■«* dfCU C . — 'Biscoe an9 to submit recommendations,fwith particular reference to a scheme which 'will probably be considered of possible allocation of separate and independent districts to Bushire, Ahwaz, Shiraz and Bander Abbas'. We may await the result of the enquiries in question. It is understood that the historical justification for the very extensive district at present embraced in the jurisdiction of the Consul-General, Bushire, is that at an earlier period, Then the authority of the Persian Government on the Persian littoral of Vhe Gulf was negligible ,^it^was desirable that the Political Resident’s charge\should be a very large one. Conditions have, of course, ( changed, and on the merits, there might, if we were certain that the present regime in Persia was likely to be permanent, be a good case for a considerable restriction of the district of the Consul-General. But it is difficult to pronounce with any confidence I on this, while any concession that we now make in the matter to Persia will tie our hands for the future . In any case, it would seem better to stand on our rights (if, as appears to be the case, we can do so) for the present at Bushire, and leave the question of /c^c 4 ~ac Ire fa** W. —- 7 ^ —nonsuTar arrangements fto be examined at more leisure m detail later in connection with the transfer of the ■X Residency to Bahrein.

(1) The district of the Consul-General, Bushire, is the 'Provinces of Pars, Khuslstan and Laristan, and the district of Lingah, and the coast and islands of the Persian Gulf being within the dominion of Persia'. This district covers geographically Shiraz, Ahwaz and Mohammerah. But we also maintain a Consul at Ahv/az , whose district is Khuzistan, who is directly responsible to the Minister at Tehran, and who is subordinate to him, and who has himself subordinate Vice-Consuls at Ahwaz and Mohammerah. ''e also maintain a Consul at Shiraz, whose district is Shiraz and who is likewise responsible directly to Tehran. Neither of these officials is administratively subordinate to Bushire, although the Ahwaz district contains a Political Department Vice- Consul at Ahwaz and at Mohammerah. The Persians can thus with some show of reason complain that they/they are required to recognise two independent Consular authorities in respect of the same district, and use this as a pretext on which to press their proposal that the Bushire district might conveniently he made co-teminous with that of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. I think that this and not the fact that the Consul-General has subordinate to him certain consuls is the difficulty. I understand in this connection from the Consular Department of the Foreign Office that international practice as regards Exequaturs varies, hut that the Persian practice appears to he the issue of an exequatur in respect of independent Consular areas, and of /recognition in respect of officers who work under an officer who has received an Exequatur. (2) We are at the moment marking time as regards arrangements in the period subsequent to the transfer of the Residency. You will remember that it has been agreed that the Resident shall no longer have a consular district in Persia, but snail be an Inspecting Consul-General, with po^er to inspect/inspect the posts within his present jurisdiction. The Foreign Office were reluctant to agree that he should in this capacity exercise real consular control over Bushire, Bander Ahbas, etc., and indicated at the time that the arrangements were made that they contemplated at seme future date the establishment possibly of independent Consular Officers in those posts, reporting normally in their consular capacity to Tehran. There is a slight misunderstanding'on the part of the Government of India as to precisely what was covered by the arrangements reached on the subject in January of this year (particularly as regards the retention by Bushire of any superintendence over Keiman and of any special relation in regard to Ahwaz). At the suggestion of the Eastern Department, we have not replied finally to the Government of India's comments on the point pending the result of the investigations now in progress and submitted on this file.In any further communication ' , * , \his subject, please quote » No. K 10005/1939/234. and address— -/t not to any person by name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 13th October, 1930, Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with the letter from this department of July 17th regarding the question of consular districts in Southern Persia, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, copies of despatches from His Majesty^ Minister at Tehran together with a copy of a telegram addressed to him in reply regarding the district assigned to His Majesty T s Consul- General at Bushire, and to state that Mr. Henderson proposes to address a further communication to Mr. Wedgwood Benn on this subject on receipt of Sir R.

It^vms pointea out that the previous Foreign Offioe lists, of which he possessed copies, disproved this contention, but he re mined im pervious to reason, mad after much fruitless discussion it was suggested tentatively that he might feake out the exequatur in terms identical with those used in the fhe Ri&lt;ght Honourable Arthur Henderson M* F*, fhe Fo rei^i Office*exequaturs of Sir F*Johnston and of Xdeut-Colonel Haworth, which had proved adequate for pracileal purpose©* This he professed himself willing to do, and 1 consider that for the few more y®&amp;r&amp; in which the Heoidency is likely to remain on Persian soil this arrangement would probably not give rise to difficulties, though admittedly unsatisfactory In prin ciple* I shall be grateful to receive your Instructions on this question* 3* , At the same time I should be glad to learn the explanation of one point which is not quite clear to nse, namely how it comes about that in the relevant Royal Com missions the province of iChusaistan is assigned to the consular districts both of His Majesty's Consul-General and of His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwas : the latter is not. as far a© I am aware, under the supervision of the former, and it is therefore difficult to tinder stand how both officers should be considered responsible for the same district* I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Tour most obedient, humble servant.

A copy of the not#! which / accompanied this document, together with a translation of the latter, is enclosed herewith. In conversation with members of other Legations, notably with the v ’r©neh and Dormans, members of ray staff had already had some inkling of this now -pretension of the Persian government to restrict the district of a foreign consular officer to that of some local administrative official regardless of the commission whioh he holds from his Sovereign. This is, however, the first official intimation vhioh I have received of a stipulation whioh m&amp;m to me not only quite impracticable but also definitely impertinent in any government, especially the Persian, which is represented abroad by a few consular officers whose The Ili^it Honourable Arthur Henderson, M*P» t mt Ttmxm office.v 'whoao di© irlotcQ te'bra-o® fm.iSQf' diirars© adrainistrstlv© ai*€as ©om© of thm m important and axtonsive a© Peraia heraelf. or ia that all: th© preaont Aroian Consul-Gen©nil at Beyrout, not o&amp;ntmt with th© mrioua atatea which form the “ 'ranch mandated territory, extends hia aoneular district to an entirely separate national entity, namely Palestine, In these oiroumtanoes you may feel tlmt strong exception should be t&amp;hen in primiple to the pretension in question.

Biscoe as His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General in Bushire, I am sending herewith, the exequatur issued in the name of the said official together with the Commission. At the same time I have the honour to refer Your Excellency to the verbal discussions which the Head of the Protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has h with Mr. Havard, the 1st Secretary of that honourable Legation, and to point out that the area of jurisdiction of the Consul- General in Bushire cannot, as a rule, be more extensive than that of the Governor (General) of the South ports and tha,t thir' British Government has also separate Consulates in Shiraz and Mohammerah and Ahwaz which are entirely excluded (indep'^^ent^i* of the area of jurisdiction of the Governor (General ?) South ports. I shall, therefore, be obliged if you would inform the competent quarters that the area of jurisdiction of the (British ?) Consul-General in Bushire would be considered as that of the Governor of the South ports and that they should tahe this into consideration while issuing commissions of the future Consuls-General so that no difficulty may arise in respect of the issue of exequaturs relating to the said appointments.

Persian objection to Consular district of His Majesty f s Consul General, Bushire). Persian claim to limit districts of foreign consular officers cannot be admitted. Best prosedure, however, would be for His Majesty’s Government and Government of India to decide together what should be proper extent of district of Consul-General at Bushire. You could then, without entering into argument, inform Persian government that Consul-General’s Commission embraces area thus decided on, and that it is for Persia, in conformity with practice of all other nations, to reconsider matter and grant exequatur accordingly. It is necessary, however, that any modifications in district should be effected before there is risk of controversy with the Persian government reaching acute stage. I therefore propose to discuss matter urgently with India Office, but before doing so it is essential for me to be able to form an opinion as to whether revision or closer definition of Consul-General’s present district is desirable. Question will probably be considered of possible allocation of separate and independent districts to Bushire, Ahwaz, Shiraz and Bunder Abbas. Please therefore after consulting Consul General report as soon as possible your recommendations as regards districts which might under such a scheme be allocated to each post. All this will take time and not solve present question of Colonel Biscoe’s exequatur. Can he meanwhile carry on without it?In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. 4 7 d iNO.

In this connection I am to invite reference to the India Office I letter of August 7th, 1877, and relevant correspondence.
