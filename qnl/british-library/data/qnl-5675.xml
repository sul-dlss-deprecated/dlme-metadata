Memorandum by Political Secretary. * India Foreign, 14th May, No. 81, 1868. A letter,* though by no means an exhaustive one, having been received from the Government of India, on the subject of the relations between Muscat and Zanzibar, and of the connexion of the British Government with these Chiefships, it is desirable that the numerous pending questions bearing directly or indirectly upon those relations should be disposed of with as little delay as possible. The complications, both political and official, are many. I here is (to speak in unofficial language), a “triangular duel,” in which Zanzibar, Muscat and Persia are the actors. It is expedient that the conflict between Zanzibar and Muscat should be first considered. The Sultan of Zanzibar (Syud Majid) stipulated, under an arbitrament of the Government of India, to pay to his brother, Syud Thoweynee, of Muscat, and to his successors, the sum of 40,000 dollars per annum. There was nothing personal about this agreement; it was a dynastical compact. And Sir William Coghlan, who negotiated this agreement, and the Reverend Mr. Badger, who assisted him* both distinctly state that it was understood in that light by the Zanzibar Chief, and so accepted by him without any reservation. J he plea, therefore, that it was a personal engagement, and lapsed on the death of Syud Thoweynee, the late ruler of Muscat, cannot' be maintained. But the Zanzibar man advances another plea. He says that the present ruler of Muscat was the murderer of his own father (Syud Majid’s brother), and an usurper; and that, in these circumstances, it is a disgrace to him to pay money to his brother’s murderer. The Government of India say that this is a mere suspicion, but I believe that the fact is not to be questioned for a moment; and, whatever may be the character or the career of Syud Salim, he has been recognized by the British Government’ and, therefore, we are as much bound to uphold* the award as if he had been a better man. More over, those who are versed in the history of Oman know well that such incidents as the 'murder of idatives, and personal or dynastical changes con sequent thereon, have been of frequent occurrence. Sir William Coghlan states that the father of the Sultan of Zanzibar died with the blood of kindred uj)on him. I am disposed to think, therefore, that this objection is a mere subterfuge; and that if it * 9638. ^ a ‘42 i had been his part to receive, instead of to pay, the subsidy, the “ non olet” doctrine would have been 1 s; he would have pocketed the 40,000 dollars without smelling a brother’s blood. As a mere question of justice and good faith between the two branches of the family, I do not see that anything can be said in favour of releasing the Sultan of Zanzibar from his engagement. As a question of policy, in which the British Government is concerned, it is to be observed, that Sir William Coghlan says “ In my estimation, it “ would have the worst possible effect throughput “ Oman and the Persian Gulf, if the British Govern- “ ment allowed the plain terms of its arbitrament to “ be set aside by such flimsy pretexts.” The Government of India, in their last letter, state dis tinctly that the good faith of the British Govern ment is involved in the maintenance of the award, and only a little time ago they were thinking of sending a ship of war to compel the Sultan of Zanzibar to act in accordance with his agreement. On the other hand, it is to be observed that the Sultan of Zanzibar is greatly impoverished, that he is much in debt, that he can with difficulty pay the subsidy, and that his financial exigencies compel him to derive profit from the importation of slaves. It has often been stated, that if he were released from the necessity of paying the subsidy, he would fall readily into an arrangement for the entire sup pression of the slave trade in the territories and waters subject to him. It is at this point that the India Office and the Foreign Office come into conflict with each other. The former wish to maintain the present relations of Muscat and Zanzibar, as a point of good faith. The latter wish to annul the present compact, so as to obtain more readily the good offices of Zanzibar for the suppression of the slave trade. Now, Zanzibar may be embarrassed by the pay ment of the subsidy; but Muscat must be equally, if not more, embarrassed by its non-payment, as it is an item of revenue, to the punctual ‘payment of which it was fairly entitled to look. And, as long as it is unpaid, Muscat will allege its non-pavment as an excuse for disorders of all kinds, including non-fulfilment of money engagements to others, and irregular means of levying revenue, by piracy, &amp;c. These irregularities have commenced, and Persia is complaining of them. Of these Persian complica tions I will presently speak more in detail. Apart from these considerations, it has been shown that we are bound, in good faith, to insist upon the payment of the subsidy to Muscat, or else, it may be said, to pay it ourselves. 1 do not howeevr, think that this would meet the diffi culty. For, by relieving Zanzibar from the nominal payment, we should break down the whole compact between the Chiefs, and Muscat would be at liberty to make war on Zanzibar, and the States of Oman would thus revert to the unfortunate condition in which they were held before Coghlan’s arbitration3 If, therefore, anything is to be done in a pecuniary way by the British Government, it would be far better, in my opinion, to leave the relations of Muscat and .Zanzibar as they r now are, and to make a specific payment to Zanzibar, in lieu of slave trade revenue. But it is to be observed that this question was mooted several years ago. When Sir George Clerk was Governor of Bombay, he recommended that the efforts of the Sultan of Zanzibar for the suppression of the slave trade should be supported both by our ships and our money. “ The Honour- “ able the Governor in Council,” it was said (March 24th, 1861), “cannot for a moment doubt that, if “ the horrors described by an Officer so cautious as “ Brigadier Coghlan were made known to the “ British nation, not a voice would be raised against “ so small an acknowledgment to Zanzibar as “ 8,500/. per annum for the attainment of so noble “ an object as the extinction of the East African “ slave trade.” This was brought to the notice of the Foreign Office in the subsequent year. But the Foreign Office (then under Lord Russell) stated that they could “ not agree to pay anything to the “ Sultan of Muscat, towards putting down the slave “ trade in his dominions,” and so the subject fell to the ground. A different view may now be taken of the subject. But it is to be borne in mind that the object to be attained is one of Imperial interest, and that it is the Empire, not the dependencies (India) that ought to pay. The Foreign Office now see the importance of relieving the finances of Zanzibar, and if they are convinced that this can not be done by our ceasing to enforce the payment of the subsidy, they may recognize the propriety of doing it in a less objectionable way. I now turn to the consideration of the compli cations in w r hich the Imaum of Muscat (Syud Salim) is involved, apart from those which arise out of his connexion with Zanzibar. The late Imaum *SyudThoweynee. (or Sultan)* rented from Persia the port, &amp;c. of Bunder Abbas, for 20 y ears from 1855, at the annual cost of 16,000 tomauns. The engage ment provides that it shall not be binding on the Shah of Persia, should an usurper at any time obtain possession of Muscat. Now, Syud Salim is held to be an usurper and a parricide, and, what is worse than all, he is a defaulter. If Zanzibar does not pay him, he cannot pay Persia. So the Persian Government, not having received their rent, ter minate the lease of Bunder Abbas. Then Syud Salim of Muscat betakes himself to reprisals. He begins a retaliatory raid, or system of piracy, in the Persian Gulf, very hurtful to the commerce of Persia; and he has threatened to blockade the port. Persia having no means of her own of effectually suppressing these outrages, applies to the British Government for its good offices, alleging that Syud Salim is upheld by England, who has recognized and assisted him. And with a view to the suppression of these alleged outrages and the 9638. A 24 permanent protection of Persian commerce in the Gulf, the Government of the Shah express a strong desire to place some ships of war of her own in these waters. These vessels the Shah wishes to he commanded by English officers; and he requests that the British Government will build them at his own cost, the money to be repaid by instalments from the Persian treasury. It is suggested that a British Naval officer should be sent to Teheran to discuss the subject. Now, it is doubtless our duty to use our good offices to restrain the otfensive proceedings of Muscat, but in respect of the Bunder Abbas atlair, we must be cautious not to commit ourselves to any measure which would be interpreted into a recognition of the Shah s right to close the agree ment, on the ground that the present ruler of Muscat is an usurper, as we have ourselves recognized him as the legitimate sovereign of the country. And as to the employment of a Persian flotilla in the Gulf, I think the measure is to be deprecated, as it might give rise to very inconvenient complications. 1 would not, however, at once discourage it. A British Naval officer (an old officer ot the Indian Navy, such as Captain Lynch or Captain Crut- tenden,) might be commissioned to proceed to Teheran to discuss the subject; but the sooner the Shah is convinced that we will do what he wants, and thus save his money, or, in other words, the sooner the whole project is stranded the bettei. These are the several complications upon which Her Majesty’s Government are now called upon to declare their opinions. The difficulty is very much increased by the fact that there are official (or de partmental ) as well as political embarrassments. Abroad there are five local authorities. The Agent at Zanzibar, who is partly under the Foreign, partly under the India Office. The Resident at Bushire, who is also under the India Office. The Political Agent and Consul General in 1 urkish Arabia, who is partly under the India Office, and partly under the Foreign Office. (The last named is only in directly mixed up with the particular complica tions to which this memorandum relates.) And then there is Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, who is entirely under the Foreign Office. It would be difficult in the circumstances above recited, to prevent some conflicts of authority, and they have very inconveniently arisen. It is unnecessary to repeat here what has been said so often about the divided responsibility of the Zanzibar Agent and Consul. Turning in the other direction, we see that the limits of the authority of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and his relations with the British Minister at Teheran, have been the subject of a lengthened correspondence, which the Foreign Office has referred to the India Office for the opinion of Sir Stafford Northcote. Nothing, moreover, is more likely than that far more serious conflicts should arise in the course of the present quarrel between Muscat and Persia, Colonel Pelly being5 iG inclined to support Muscat rather more than is agreeable to Mr. Alison. It is obvious in the face of the foregoing facts, that there is a very embarrassing state of affairs’ which is more likely to grow worse than to grow better as Zanzibar and Muscat sink more deeply into debt; and that it behoves the British Govern ment very seriously to consider some definite and consistent policy to be pursued towards the Chiefs of Muscat and Zanzibar, and in respect of the rela tions of the former with Persia. I do not see that there is any very hopeful prospect of this, so long as the diplomatic action of the British Government is conducted by two different Departments, through agents recognizing different authorities. After an ex perience of twelve years in my present appointment, I can confidently assert, that there is no business done so badly as that which is done by two Depart ments of the State,—in this case, by the Foreign Office and the India Office. There is a tendency to shift responsibility from one to the other; to stave off the consideration of a troublesome question by referring it to another Department; asking the “opinion” or the “observations” of another Minister. Time is lost in these references and counter references, business is increased, delays are numerous, and sometimes, in the course of this shuttle-cocking, a grave matter drops out of sight altogether. Of course, if public servants were immaculate this would not happen. But I write not of what ought to be, but of what is, and, I believe, ever will be. The fewer, then, the occasions of these references between the Foreign Office and the India Office the better. They must happen sometimes, but is it wise to perpetuate a system which multiplies this sort of duplex action as much as if it had been cunningly invented for the express purpose ? The answer being, of course, in the negative, it results that measures should be taken to bring all these several agencies, Zanzibar, Muscat, and Persia, under one undivided authority. The question, then, is, whether that one authority should be the Foreign Office or the India Office? We have invited the opinion of the Government of India as to the expediency of placing Zanzibar entirely under the Foreign Office, and the opinion is adverse to such an arrangement. It is obvious that Zanzibar and Muscat should be under one authority, and that we could not sever our con nexion with Zanzibar without also letting go our hold of Muscat. Now, some high authorities are of opinion that all the affairs of the Persian Gulf should continue to be regulated from India. There does not appear to be so strong a reason for this as there was at the time when the Indian Navy existed; but still there are, doubtless, advantages in the system. And, having reference to the fact that the Indian Department of Her Majesty’s Go vernment is the one most versed in Oriental usages and best acquainted with the Oriental character,r 6 Sir Stafford Northcote may, perhaps, consider it more advisable to place the entire group of agencies, thus connected with each other, under the super intendence of the India Office. It might be the best solution of the difficulty to let us again take the entire business (including that of Persia) into our hands. But it would be obviously absurd to do so if, on the occurrence of a change of Govern ment, there should be any likelihood (as on the last occasion) of the reversal of the arrangement. J. W. Kaye.
