I know that Mr. Scott was a very able and dis tinguished Officer of the Survey Department, but I had hoped to secure the services of a very much younger man. I presume, however, from the fact that the Government of India has suggested our engaging a re tired Officer, that no suitable Officer on the active list is available. In these circumstances I hope you will allow us, before proceeding to consider the en gagement of Mr. Scott, to ask whether Mr. G. P. Tate who knows Persia and who is, I understand, at the pre sent moment retiring from the Indian Survey would take on this Company's v/ork at once at a salary of Rs. 800 The Under Secretary of State, per Foreign Office.per month. He would need to bring with him from India a email establishment whose cost would be de frayed. My Company would also pay the travelling expenses of the party to and from the Country to be surveyed, and would provide tents and carriage for the party while there. The Survey at present re quired is Triangulation only, and in accordance with the last paragraph of your letter now under reply we have decided to abandon the idea of a scale of 6' to the mile and to adopt a scale of either 1' or 2' to the mile as may be settled on the spot between our Representatives in Persia and Mr. Tate, if we are able to secure Mr. Tate’s services. Inasmuch as the cold weather is already well advanced, as the Christmas and New Year holidays in India are immin ent, and as it is very important that as much of the Triangulation measurements as possible should be completed during this cold weather, I shall es teem it a very great favour if you can cause a tele gram to the above effect to be sent to India as quickly as possible.

In these circumstances it becomes necessary to consider what reply should be returned to the com pany's original proposal for a joint survey. As regards this question, Sir E. Grey is of opinion that the interest of this Department in the results of such a survey is not sufficiently direct to justify an application to the Treasury for au thority to incur expense under this head. It ap pears to him that the matter is one which more nearly concerns the Government of India and I am accordingly to enquire v/hether Viscount Morley would see his way to sanction the participation of that Government in a work of this nature either by the loan of a sur veyor to undertake it or by sharing the expense in volvedInvolved in its accomplishment or in both of these ways. Should Lord Money's reply be favourable to the proposal in principle, Sir E.

Mf Per sia , Now that this Company has undertaken the development of the supposed Oil fields of Persia it has become necessary for it to arrange for an exhaustive geological survey. Preparatory to this however a detailed and reliable topographical Survey is necessary, and I cannot find that anything of the kind has ever yet been made. In these circumstances I venture to asK you firstly whether there are in your Office any records of any such Survey, and secondly whether, if there are no such records, it is likely that the British Grovemrnent or the Government of India would probably be willing to co-operate in such a Survey. I do not know whether either of the Governments is anxious for a reliable and detailed topographical Survey of Western or of any part of Persia, but if either is, or botn are The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.are, I should be grateful for an opportunity of laying before you a scheme. Speaking generally, it would take the form of Gk)vern- ment*s supplying an Officer to do the triangulation, and to connect up the country to be surveyed with points already fixed on the Persian Gulf. This could obviously be done much more quickly and easily by an Officer of the Indian Survey, who would have at his disposal the records of the mapping already done along the Gulf of Persia. The details would then be filled in by this Company’s Surveyors, who would in turn be followed by Geologists employed by this Com pany, and all our maps would of course be at once made available to the Government. As it is necessary for us to proceed with the Survey of a section of country in the neighbourhood of Shuster during the coming cold weather, I take the liberty of beg ging for your early consideration of the question.
