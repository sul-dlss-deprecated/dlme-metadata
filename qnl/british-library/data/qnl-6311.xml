RESIDENT.Telegram P. n From Political Agent, Bahrain. To Resident, S.S. M CHAKDARA” No. 148. Rated A ^ T6th December 1927. Poliowing is summary of letter from Ibn Saud, begins We regret action of Mesopotamian Government in these days as it is breach of agreement between us for preservation of peace. We see in each incident proof of lack of good faith of Mesopotamian Government and we give a few recent happenings from which you can understand situation. . , The refugee Shammar tribe used to raid Nejd territory and we protested to High Commissioner. About November last year High Commissioner warned us that party of Sham ar having left Mesopotamia were gathering in Syrian desert with intention of attacking out tribes. As attacking tribes cannot enter our territory without prev- -ionsly traversing territory Trans-Jordan or Mesopotamia we protested against Mesopotamian Government. High Commissioner sent no answer to our protest. Ten months later Mesopotamian Government began to build military posts at wells near frontier and spread rumour that those places would join up by rails and become strong fortresses on weak frontier. This action load worst effect among Nejd tribe as it was contrary to Article III *Uqair Agreement of 12th Rabi ath-Thani 1342 (21-11-23). We sent protest to High Commissioner on 9th Rabi-al-Awal (6-9-27). High Commiss- -ioner neglected to reply to this protest, but replied only to our first protest regarding movement of Shammar from Mesopotamia to Syria, He said as it? was intention of Mesopotamian Government to prevent movement of such raiders they had established posts near Nejd frontier. The number of fortresses is mentioned in his letter of April 20th,2 9663, wlxich we received in August 1927. You can see these fortified posts are far from the road hy which refugees had gone to Syria. The Nejdis saw posts are erected only as a provocation. We again protested to High Commissioner on 24th RaM-al-Awal, 1346 (2±st Septem- -ber 1927). We received no answer to our letter. On reaching Riyadh we saw clearly the effect of raid amongst our frontier tribes and that it was difficult to keep order on the excited frontier. We wrote from Riyadh to High Commissioner on 10th Jamadi-al-awal (5-11-27) inform- -ing him of the state of affairs and followed this with another letter dated 12th Jamadi-al-awal (7th November 192^ but still no answer came. We can see no good reason for his silence. The longer the silence las ter the more critical became the situation and finally it became impose- -ible to preserve peace on the frontier. We request you to communicate to British Government our strong protest against Mesopotamian Government. We wish to preserve peace and friendly relations with British Government. Mesopotamian Government will be responsible for anything which occurs. Enas. Original will be sent to Bushire. Ibn Saud expected in Hasa about December 25th.

For any issued orders for enquiry and punishment of offenders and strict watch on f'x&amp;nixi frontier and prevention of further incident while corres pondence regarding fort is proceeding. Compensation is a trifle but before discussing it he invited attention to question of responsibility which falls on Mesopotamia. secondly. This case should be compared with others like it which have taken place between Mesopotamia, Trans jordan and Nejd and Hedjaz. He warned Mesopotamia of bad results which their conduct entailed but received no answer. He invites your attention to his letter of 30th Jamad-al-awal describing iniquities of Mesopotamia their attempt to cause trouble between him and E.M. Gov eminent.

We beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.127 dated 22nd Jamad al Awal 1346 * 17th November 1927 which contains an ans?/er from H.E. the High Commissioner for Iraq to our protest which we sent from Mecca on 9th Rabi al Awal 1346. What made us feel surprised is that the date of High Commissioner^ letter is 4th Jarnad al Awal =30th October 1927 but it was despatched to us on 22nd =17th November 1927 i.e, 18 days after it was written. It was a coincidence that attracts a man 1 s attention. We sent out protest about an important and critical matter the reply for which was written after two monthd and more than this ve get it after three months. H.E. the High Commissioner stated in his reply that he was surprised at our protest about the building of the fort and other similar ones at the frontier and that the first was miles away from the boundary. We do not want to argue with H.E. about the miles whether they be far or near as we had no agreement about fixed miles and the agreement between us which is accepted and considered is as follows*' ^Article, three. Both Governments on the part of each of them undertake not to use the water and wells exixting at the borders of the boundary for any military purposes such as the building of forts at them or the mobilisation of troops at scbotkK their borders). This is the wording of the article three of Ujair Protocol dated 12th Rabi al Awal 1341. Would not then Busaiyah, the places belonging to it, the waters neai by it and other places at the border come under this article which had forbidden building at them/ Was there any mention in the article about the miles or the distance r And is that tuildin g a breach of this article or not?3 / ® If they (Iraq) pretend that this breach was in our inter- ~est for preventing raiders from raiding us the ITajdis consider such sort of a building as a breach of their treaties and pre~ -cisely the road that leads trouble to them. Therefore I can see trnly two clear methods of meeting the situation,either the &amp;boYementioned article is considered in force in which case the buixdings erected should be removed s^nd Busaiyah should be the ““•I'S as they are contrary to the provisions of the said article or this article is not to be carried out ind the forts built are not removed in which case the treaties with the Iraq Government will all be considered cancelled,for which we shall feel TQxy sorry for the obstinacy which the Iraq Government dis- -play. We still repeat our protest against the breach of that article and ask for the removal of the buildings which have been erected at the earliest date in compliance with the undertakings in the interests of order and as a precaution against troubles rhi^,. a-, ise account of lettinj^ltnatters lapse and become cri tical at the frontier as we have explained in our previous letters to His Excellency the High Commissioner on the subject.

Government have caused and are causing to give rise to a dispute between us and themseibesl'in addition to that to cause trouble between us and the British Government. When one looks at all the actions of the Iraq Government to- -wards us one will not see that they are the actions ox’ a friendly neighbour to one in Treaty with them but the spirit of an enemy will be seen and rather you can say that they are a breach of the spirit of peace. I give in detail a chain o- actions done by them {Iraq ) in these days from which you can understand their real situation and it will make clearer to H. B.M*s Government the responsibility for the recent incidents^ I. The High Commissioner for Iraq waxneo us that a rai party of Shammar were collecting in Syria to raid our country and that the Iraq Government were not responsible for their action. I protested as the raiders were bound to pass on then- way to our country either through the territory of Trans-Jor- -dania or Iraq and asked that the responsibility of the same may be borne either by the Iraq Government or Trans-Jordania but the reply -was as I have informed the Hon’ble the Political Resident in my abovementioned letter - a silence for about 10 months without a reply. Then came a reply but in a very strange way as he made our protest a means of breaking the protocol entered into at Ujair with the Iraq by building a number of forts for our protection and for preventing raiders from raiding us.The Hejd people would be pleased if the Ira- -qis raided them every morning and evening but they do not agree to the building of one metre on the waters and the places on which building has been prohibited by an official document. These places are visit** visited by them and are their watering places as well as places of visit and watering for others than them. Trouble broke out in Hejd on account of this building in the manner I described to the Hon'ble the. Political Resident. were 2. The .raq Government^** not satisfied » UhBSSS sort of 'breach but began to interfere with the chiefs of ou.j. tribes and cau ed theia to attend its meetings (conferences) ihiii xs totally prohibited by the provisions of the treaties entered into at Ujair and Bahrah* An example of this is a letter from the ¥utassarrif of Divaniyah to Mahammed al Turk! bin Mijlad and Jasa bin Mijlad asking them to look into the craims relating to the plunder of the tribes* We have protested against this action in a letter which we sent to the High Corn-* -missioner for Iraq dated 1st Rabi al Awal 1346 but no reply has been received from the High Commissioner up to this hour and we cannot understand the cause sf th for this neglect* Fne motor cars of the Iraq Government officials and also; ~ oni£ aero Planes are always going as far as the frontier and mix with our Arabs*This is done with the intention of having an e, .ret, on our tribesmen either to persuade them to commit an act which will cause dissension between neighbours or for some o-uii^r reason/ of which we cannot see the justification* 4. Those who study some of the Iraq newspapers especially d-:s papers connected with the High officials of the Iraq Govern- ~ ment Yj:l11 see £rom the attacks and insults against us and our Government show indications of the amount of hatred and hidden (bad)feeling # i , rom this you will see that the Iraq Government k aYe ' broken our treaty first by allowing her officials to com- -municate with our subjects and by allov/ing their officials tc visit our country with their motor cars among our tribes to cause sedition and have broken their promise by building these posts the building of which is not permissible*We shown in their newspapers a condition that leads to the kindling *f the flame of enmity between the two countries,Who then will he responsible for all this for the incidents &amp;£ which may be ca,i ' ^ ^ SOHe those people whose feelings have been rouoed They have seen their self respect dishonoured,their treaties broken and their neighbour waiting for his chance inside those buildings.they went without the consent of the Government.! prevented the Hejd people totally from raiding from the date »t entered Into treaty for thp nvo i the prevention of the raids andand have have held them with an iron grip.3ut raids on us have ty never 'been discontinued either hy the Iraq or/Trans-Jordania* The Uejd people Dheyed us with much patience in being prevented as they mere respecting the undertaking we have taken to stop raids# But 1 had no excuse to put before them about th^s evil omened building# As they had seen the provision of the treaties which prevent such building and that we have prevented them from build- -ing such post in similar stations within^ our territory* We warned the British Government to look v.ith justice on this case then they will see that we are the people who comply with iur undertaking and preserve what belong to otherd.

He says that owing to want of water at Aneaseh headquarters whole tribe are clamouring to go to neighbourhood of Birlussuf south-west of Hajaf but fear to do so because of Ikhwan threat. He urges confidence be restored by immediate air attacks on Mutair headquax*ters which he believes Ibn Baud would welcorae. Failing this he asks me to send aeroplanes and armoured cars to be with him for some time and restrain his tribe from panic. If something is not done immediately he fears half his tribe will become Ikhwan and join Faisal al Dawish and remainder will flee to Lyria to ask protection of French authorities. I am considering his request for support of aeroplanes and armoured cars but it is plain that all opinion now favours air attacks on Hutair.

I would stress point in Kuwait telegram No. 266 that ©Ten if Ibn S&amp;ate Saua could punish Mutair, which is doubt- •ful, he Kira probably could not do so for political reasons rv since if he offends Ikhwan susceptibilities his main a)fld he$ed- -itary support is gone. In arguing against post at Eusaiyah he is more than probably merely voicing frontier tribal opinion not because he wants to but because he has to do so and his statement that this post and others projected h&amp;Ye causeu excitement amongst frontier tribes is correct. My own information corroborates olitical ;lgent, Kuwait, that Ibn Saud would not be sorry to see Faisal al Bawish disappear but he cannot take action to this effect himself. I have today received telegram from Bahrain say- -ing letter has come from Ibn Laud in answer to my letter sent under sanction of your telegram 4b8, dated 9th December.saying that he is detained by pressure of work at Biadh but hopes to meet me later..

Government are convinced that irtiatever may be the personal attitude of Ibn TSaud towards raids, as to which results of Haworth’s conversation with Ibn Baud must be awaited, it is essential that early steps should be taken to make raiders understand that further aggression on their part willnot be tolerated. In view of the difficulty of catching raiders red-handed, which would clearly be best and most effective method, only practicable course appears to be to attack their headquarters from the air. Belection of particular villages etc. most suited for such attack must be left to your decision in consultation with Air Officer Commanding. Air Ministry suggest following objectives as possibly suitable for purpose j- HAFAH AL BATIK, JAR! YAH AL ILYAH, JAB I YAH AS SIFhAH. Would no doubt consider what advanced bases it would be necessary to establish in order to facilitate attack. question of bombing main tribal headquarters at ARTAWIYAK has also been raided but the place could presumab* -ly be reached only bases in Kuwait and political objections to using iiuwait territory for such a purpose are obvious. I shall be glad to have your views on this point. You should send iimnediate message to Ibn Baud informing him of latest raid and stating that we regard it as absolutely2 absolutely essential to take punitive action against raiders ^ho, by his owi admission, are acting in direct defiance of his authority. He will understand these zaeasures indie- -ate no hostilities towards hiiaself but are temporary ejeped- -ients forced upon us by conditions arising out of his loss of control over his own tribesmen. It should be made elea* / to him that our action will take the form of bombing villages of guilty tribes. After a lapse of a reasonable interval, during which warnings would be dropped, punitive action would be taken accordingly. Every care should be exercised that no action is taken against any place which has been occupied by Ibn Saud’s regular troops or where his authority has been re-established. As to this you will no doubt confirm rumour mentioned in your telegram Ho. 622 that ABTAWIYAH has been occupied by Ibn Saud f s forces. You will doubtless do all that is possible by show of force or such other means at your disposal to restore confidence of wavering f Iraqi tribesmen. Addressed -daghdad 1, repeated ] At shire.

Dated 4th January 1928# No I* ’Iraq ministers, Air Officer Commanding and I have dis cussed the question of attacking tribal headquarters, and have decided unanimously that it is impracticable to do so* No buildings are known to exist except at Artawiyah which is too far off* Other places are only small oases or wells and if tents were pitched and occupied they would doubtless scatter when they received warning and no subsequent opera tions of any value would be possible* The maps we have are far from accurate and thefce is no British Officer in ’Iraq who has a sufficient knowledge of the country to insure the objectives being reached by the machines. Any operations undertaken must fulfil two purposes both of which are equally important (A) to stop the raiding forth with and (B) to inflict as severe a punishment as possible on the Mutair* The Air Officer Commanding and I think that these objectives can be obtained by exercising air control over the largest possible area of Najd territory* Two air bases will therefore be established forthwith under the protection of armoured cars* To start with these bases will be well within the territory of ’Iraq, but will be gradually pushed forward as far to the south as the question of supplier permits, and it is hoped will eventually be loca ed one at each end of the iax neutral zone* Warnings will be dropped to camps and grazing parties where the Mutair usually graze telling them to march south to the frontier withing four days* Failure to do so will mean that they will be attacked, Parties oh the move without flocks and herds will be presumed to be raiders and will be attacked without warning whenever met* There is no fear that the forces of Ibn Sa’ud will be in the area controlled* I believe that this method affords the best hope of (A) putting a stop to raiding, (B)punishing the Mutair, (C) showing the Ikhwan that we are as able to@^7’ prevent them from grazing peacefully In their normal pastures as they are to prevent T Iraq tribes from grazing peacefully in ’Iraq, and (D) forcing the Mutair to submit to Ibn Sa*ud. These measures will make it Impossible to comply with the Shaikh of the ’Anizah’s request for aeroplanes and armoured cars to protect his tribe, but they should reassure the ’Anizah* Small posts equiped with wireless and Lewis guns will also be established forthwith, probably as a permanent measure, at Shabichah and Salman* Desert opinion is strongly in favour of the blockade of Hasa ports as being the most effective weapon against the Ikhwan. It would not, however, have as rapid an effect as attacks on the Mutair, and it ka£ has the further objection that it would look as oif it were directed against Ibn Sa’ud himself, and not against his rebellious tribes* I still think, how*- ever, that this measure should be adopted if those proposed in this telegram prove ineffective* Latest Najd news is very conflicting but indicates that the measures taken by Ibn Sa’ud hgalnst Dawish have been checked by the ’Utaibah tribes’ threatening attotude.

I made no mention of any question of employing the ‘Iraq Army* Shaikh Hafidh asked me whether we were obtaining Ibn ’ud’» approval to our operations, I replied that, apart from the necessity for immediate action, it seemed to me that a request for Ibn laud’s consent to the operations would be embarrassing con siderably. While he might in his heart of hearts welcome them, it was clearly impossible for him officially to agree to them. It seemed to me better for us to go ahead in the hope that the operations might really prove helpful to Ibn Sa’ud as well as to ’Iraq, although we should expect to receive an official protest from him. He then suggested that we might, in our message to Ibn Sa'ud, mention a date on which the operations would begin and fix that date in such a way as to give Ibn Sa’ud time to receive aur message before the operations actually commenced. He told me that a message can be sent from Kuwait to Riyadh, where Ibn Ea’ud is and where he is likely to remain, in six days. 1 said that although we were very anxious not to embarrass Ibn Sa’ud we had at the same time a clear duty to the ’Iraq Government and must take immediate steps to step the Mutair raiding and reassure the ’irao tribes, He said he nuite realised this and thought that the action we proposed takir. might be effective in punishing the futair and in preventir them from raiding; although he pointed out that the Mutair are in a state of exalted religious fanaticism and have no fsar whatever of death. At the same time he felt sure th it would do great harm to ibr Sa’ud, a© all of his tribes would be angry with him and would accuse him of calling ir ’infidels’ to hslp him against ’true believers’. He wenl onon to aa^yr that one reason which operated to deter Ibn 8a*ud from suppressing Faieal al Dawieh hy force was hie fear that Bawieh mi^ht flee to ’Iraq, that hie ’dakhala’ ml*ht be accepted by the ’Iraq Oowernrent, and that he would then be colie a source of friction in the same way a® the refugee Shammar had been in the past. I pointed out that it was scarcely likely that ^awish would try to take rofure in 1 Iren when the Air Force were undertaking active operation® against him* I asked him how far he thought Ibn 8a*ud was really able to suppress the Mutair. ts said that according to his information Ibn Sa’ud was now holding a meeting of the rail- gioue leaders at Kiyadh in order to obtain from them a fatwa to the effect that Faisal al £awieh had offended against the the Shara’ by rebelling against the State, arid that he would ther be able to declare a ’Jehad 1 against him* X asked him whether he thought that the Akhwan tribes would obey such a fatwa* He said that the harb would undoubtedly do so* As regards the ’Ataibah, Cultan ibn Bmnaid was personally not on good terms with ^awish; he had, however, eggod him on to his present insubordination and intended to join him if he was thoroughly successful* He would not® however, be really sorry Mir if Bawieh was crushed by Ibn 8a’ud and would, in that event, submit to Ibn 3a’ud * He said that Bawieh, himself, was a religious fanatic and that his followers were either religious fanatics like himself or scoundrels who were merely out for loot. Hi said that Ibn Sa'ud was thoroughly sick of the Akhwan and were opposing all hie attempts at progress. Ibn 8a*ud wished to connect up all his headquarters by wireless?, wnich would not only be a more efficient but a much better means of communication thean the present method, but that he was prevented from doing so by the Akhwan* I then handed him a copy of the notice which it is proposed to drop in i^ajd territory; his only eoimisnt was that it should bs printed in good large typw. Turning- 5 - /Qi K Turninp to th© oueetion of the lusaiyah poet, he ©eked me whether it would not he possible to abandon it. 1 said that no^only wae this entirely out of the question but that other poets would probably be estab 11 shed in future. He then ©aid that no pood could possibly cojr?e of the continuance of the present discussion of the wronp® or riphte of the case. would go on insisting that Busaiyah was not 'ala atraf al hudud', while Ifcn Sa'ud would go on insisting that it was without enter- ing into any reasonable ©xil&amp;nation for hi© contention. It was quite clear to any intelligent nan that 'ala atraf el hudud' could only mean within four or five miles of the frontier, and he did not personally believe that ihn Sa»ud really thought that there had been any contravention of the OJair Protocol. At the esuae time, the tribes were in a state of intense indignation on account of the establishment of this post and Ibn Oa’ud was com pelled to voice public opinion in the matter. He suggested (and the suggestion seems to no a very good one) that recourse should be had to arbitration. There should, he imagined, be only one result of such arbitration, but Ibn Sa*ud 1 s face would H© would be able to say to his tribes, *2 have etated my point of view and the British Government have stated theirs. The case has been referred to an impartial Judge and we must abide by his decision'. He thought that it would be better for the suggestion for arbitration to come from Ibn la’ud himself and suggested that he should write to Ibn Ba’ud proposing this solution without Ibn 8 a’ud knowing that he had discussed it with us. He mentioned to me incidentally that he had received a fortnight ago a letter, which he promised to show to ~e, from Ibn Sa’ud to Lord Lloyd. The letter, after dealing with matters with which Lord Lloyd was concerned, went on to make three com plaints connected with ’Iraq? (i) that the High Commissioner had not nr ewcre^d Tip letter 5 , (ii) that the Bueaiyah post was a con travention of the Ojair Irotocol, and (iii) that he had certain information/ ub inf^or^ati or both Faisal aR4 Abdullah wop© Ptirrinp up Ibn ^©•ttd 1 © tribes against him. He ©aid that he had not forward^ this letter and had written to Xbn Sa*ud explaining his reasons for withholding it. These reasons were, th^t the letter con tained a complaint apainst the 1 Iraq Gorernment and apainst Hie Britannic Majesty * s Government *e representative there. It should, therefore, have been addresred either to ft # £. or to the British Government direct and not to their representative in h^yot who had nothin^ whatever to de with thei-r affairs. had received a letter from Ibn Sa’ud in which the latter stated that he had ashed the ! ritish Goveriur«eRt to send a delegate toh hi» to discuss the difficulties between ♦ Iraq and iSajd. The letter to him did not state what aeetinp place had been suggested. I said that the British Government had not, so far ae i knew, yet received any such communication from Ibn Sa’ud, but thought It possible that this fact might be explained by the message having been sent from Hijar, we also discussed the nationality question about which 1 shall note separately. •'‘o also told, me that just before leaving Kuwait he (Id) 7/1/P8.&amp; /os' there were no regular courte in *aj4 # but the justice edt»inie- tered wee of the kind suitable to the desert tribee and there wan no valid excuse for refusing extradition* Moreover there was the question of political offenders. In a country like Nejd it was imposeible to separate political offences frotn ordinary criminal offences. 4 # I pointed out that there had been no refusal in prin ciple on the part of ’Iraq to conclude an extradition agree ment to deal with ordinary criminals. In Article 10 of the Bahra Agreement it had been specifically provided that discus sions with this object should be Initiated within one year i.e. before the 1st Bovember, 19S6* Unfortunately first of ell Ibn Sa*ud had said that he was too busy to arrange a conference with 9 Iraq and later when a conference was arranged circum stances had prevented its taking plaoe* I thought that now # as soon as the difficulties caused by the Mutalr raids had passed, the negotiations for an extradition agreement should certainly take place. But I warned him that there could be no yielding on the point of political offenders. To refuse t the extradition of political offenders was a universal custom, both in Kurope among the most advanced nations and in Asia among the most backward, and Ibn Sa 9 tid could not expect an exception to be made for him, 5 . We then turned to the question of the recent Ifiutair ^ . The Shaikh repeated what he had said to the Counsellor. I assured him that the last thought of His Britannio Majesty 9 * Government, or of myself ae their representative, or even of the ’Irao Government (who were not influenced by the personal feelings of King Faisal) was to weaken Ibn Sa 9 ud. We recog- * ? * i ' * . S \ nised that without him Arabia would fall into anarchy and that it wae far better for ♦Iraq that there should bs a strong con solidated Government on her borders. But we could not sit still and do nothing under the constant attacks from the Mutair and, as Ibn Sa 9 ud had told us that they were out of hies hie control, nothin# wae loft for hnt to try to restrain them oureelver by punitive meneurea. If they were weakened by our n&amp;eaBurea 9 it would be so much the easier for Ibn Ba , ud to regain control of them* I beared him to convey an assurance from me to Ibn Ba*ud that we wished his Government to be strong and effective* 6* X then asked the Shaikh what **as the real objection of the Akhwan tribes to the posts at Busaiyah and elsewhere, which I explained were for the purpose of getting rapid information in the desert and enabling us to be ready to stop either raids from tribes in Syria into &amp;ajd across the ’Irao corridor (and this, I said, had been their original object) or raids from Sajd into ’Iraq. He said that a strong rumour had been put about among the Akhwan tribes that the posts wtre only a pre liminary to a railway and that they believed that Ibn Sa’ud had entered into* o secret agreement with the British Govern ment to build ft railway fftftft ftl to fcil and onwards, for the purpose of domiriating the Akhwan# This was the real reason for their excitement. 7, Shaikh Hafidh then informed me that he was now going definitely to write to Ibn Sg’ud and suggest arbitration on the meaning of the expression •ala atraf al hudud* in the Ojair Agreement. P t The Shaikh then turned to the question of his mission to ^gypt and Ibn Baud’s letter to Lord Lloyd. He said that the principal question about which Ibn Sa f ud was concerned was the Italian penetration of* the Yemen. This rads Ibn Sa’ud** position insecure and was bound to bring trouble in its train# It was far the moat vital question from Ibn Sa’ud’s point of view# He was commissioned to say to Lord Lloyd that, if Hie Britannic Majesty’s Government Quid arrange to exclude Italian influence from the Yemen, Ibn Sn’ud could then undertake the exclusion of Bolshevik influence from the Hijas which was a matter of the greatest importance for the British# The BolsheviksI/O f . 4 - Bolpheriks # largely throurh th« pilprim* from the Dutch Koct Indiee # were in a position to do great harm in the Hijas and to epread their propaganda awonp all the pllgrime* There were al po stronp cofit ingente of pilrrime frotr. Central Asia # where of couree Boleherilf influence was supreme. Ifcn Sa*ud t the Shaikh said, was very anxious that a British representative should pro to confer with him on these two points and also on the relations between himself and 1 Iraq and they hoped that the representative would he soneone like Sir Gilbert C1ay r on. I made no comment on the points about Italian penetration of the Yemen and about Bolshevik aganda # except to ask him whether Ibn Sa’ud believed that Bolshevik propaganda could be dangerous to hie own rule. The Shaikh replied that it was undoubtedly dangerous to Ibn Ss , ud t simce it aimed generally at upsetting men’s minds and destroying all authority. 9 # The Shaikh then took hie leave. I agnin urged on mm to impress, on Ibn Sa’ud that I personally as High Commis sioner entertained the friendliest feelings towards his rule and was anxious to see it strengthened and that 1 had in the pant insisted and should continue to insist that nothing should be done from the ’Iraq side in a spirit unfriendly to him or destgaed to a'&gt;en his control-, \ (Gd) H.

Government greatly appreciate His Majesty T s confidence in them and are most anxious to assist in every *ray in their pemer to find a solution of present difficulties Between NEJD and IRAq. For this purpose they hope that His Majesty may find it possible at an early date to accept the invitation which they sent him on January 2nd to meet Col. HAWORTH, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, for a discussion of the regrettable misunderstanding which has arisen in regard to the treaty. They are unable to under- -stand on what grounds His Majesty and NEJD tribes could regard construction of Busaiyah post as an infraction of the UQAIR Protocol; the latter speaks of ALA ATRAF AL HUDUD' (near frontier) whereas BUSAIYAH is no less than 50 miles from the neutral zone. It is of first importance that this misunderstanding should be cleared up. H.M*b. Govern- -aent are confident that this object will be fully attained at a meeting of His Majesty and Col. HAWORTH but should any further discussion appear necessary at a later stage they will bo quite prepared to consider other arrangements for a meeting between representatives of yxn themselves and Your Majesty.

HAWORTH.Confidential ., Residency, Bathdad, dated ?' Tamiary, 1928. Sir, 1 have the honour to transmit the enclosed statoment containing detailed replies to the various allegations* and argument 0 put forward by uing Xbn Sa*ud in hie letters on the eub-fect of the construction of the Bueaiyah Police Post and lt&amp; consecuencee, which has been prepared primarily for the use of Colonel Haworth in the event of a meeting being arranged between him and \ing ibn aducU :&gt;, lo judge from the contents of ing xbn na*ud * s letters, he appears to be under the impression that ♦ the *Xraq Government made hi© claim that they were responsible for preventing raids from Syria to Kajd a pretext for establishing a chain of fortresses in U the desert south west of iwaniyah and vasiriyah. 0 has some justification for his arguifient that a chain of fortresses in this locality is not conveniently sited for the purpose of intercepting raiding parties crossing from Syria to Hajd, and for his suspicion that the * Iraq Government had some other motive for the creation of these posts. The Right Mon*bio u.C*4;.S. iMssry, B#C., 11*?* y 3«o rotary of ^tats for the Colonies, Oowning- Street, London, &gt;•: 5 * in the first pi ioe it advisable to explain to Xing Xbn Sa f ud that the list of poets south west of Masiriyah and Biwaaiyah contained in ;.-r* Bourdillon’ s letter to him of 17th August, 1927, were, with the single exception of Busaiyah, old post© which had been established some tine before. It is therefore not the fact that the * Iraa Govern ment seized the opportunity of erecting a chain of posts in the desert* 1 enclose a statement showing the locality and strength of the police post© which existed in this region at the time of the attack on Busaiyah, and the dates on which they were established* fhe statement includes the Abu Char post which has since been abandoned and also the Caiman post which was only established in etober 1927. ffc* latter post was in an exposed position and had no defences of any kind; it was therefore abandoned after having been occupied for a few days. (it is, as you are aware, now being reest ibliched and fortified). it was intended that a copy of this statement together with a map should be o dfti&amp;un ic at ad to ing Ibn Ba’ud in reply to his letter dated the 21st of September, 1927, but the attack on J usaiyah supervened and the correspond ence was broken off. 4. Secondly it may be admit ted that, although these desert post© is intelligence centres would undoubtedly facilitate the interception of any raiding-3- partie© froKi Syria which might ta^e the route to the east of the impaasahl® '“'ahana Aeeert (which lie» clo p« to the neutral zone), this waft not the only eon p iteration which pro, pted the * . rao ( owera ent to ertablirh them. Vs you are aware, the * Iran ehepherd tribe« who graze their flocits in the desert south west of Naeiriyah, have in past years been terrorised, by Faisal el X&gt;a«ieh into paying blada-ail to hie agents in return for immunity from his raids. 1’he establislmient of small desert police posts gawe the tribes confidence in Ui@ ability of the Government to protect them froa hnisal al Dawieh md consequently they ceaeed to pay blaeiatiail i; 0 &gt;'aieal ai hawieh. It wa® therefore with the perfectly Xm itifflate object of protecting their own tribes fro^ Faisal al Dawieh as well a® preventing raids into lajd territory that the 'Iraq Govern ent established these posts, and it is for that very reason that their establishment was so strongly resented by Faisal al Fawieh and hi« following* , 1 KU. goat that, in the course of the conversa tion® to be held with ing Ibn Sa*ud, the facts to which preced ing I have referred in the two^paragraphs should be laid •'*.ra‘hcly before bhii. 6. X am sending cop id ft of this despatch nd of He enclosures to the Political Resident, Bushire, the i. olitical Vgent, Kuwait, the high Commissioner, Terueaiam, andIbn 3a 1 ud in the 1 Iraq Press* .Tula to 6 c$^-&gt;.b 6r, 1927 ♦ ihe * Iraq papers which lend any appreciable attention zo Ibn Sa*ud 1 s affaire are:- .ll- 1 Iraq. Al-Istiqlal. Aji-Nahdha. A.z-Canaan. Iheir publications about Ma,jd and ♦Iraq affairs are almost restricted to the following:- (a) .Progress of Administrative Affairs, reform, etc. in Ha.jd. This consists in the main of information copied from foreign papers and in general is most creditable to Ibn a*ud. (b) Attempts in Zubair to win 'Iraqis over to Kajd iNationality - Naturally unfavourable but not damaging to Ibn Sa'ud 1 ® personal reputation as a rul'r. (c) Reception of the pilgrims - r ery favourable to Ibn 8a 1 ud. (d) Treaty of Jiddah - The »Iran press was almost equally divided in their reception of this treaty - some acclaiming it as a great success others as a camouflaged failure - It may however be remarked that opinions of the latter type were mainly taken from the Syrian press. (e) The plot against Ibn Sa’ud - i ere reporting of information without comment* (f) Dispute between Ibn Sa’ud and the Dawish Analysis of the probable causes of difference. Najdi danger to Kuwait. Akhwan attacks on ’Iraq territory.itf @&gt; - 2 - (3) On careful examination of publications in the '‘Iraq press on these subjects a fair minted man can easily discern the following :- (a) The ’Iraq press as a whole has given fair publication in its columns to information creditable to Ibn Sa»ud in connection with his adi inis t rat ion of affairs in his territories - except in regard to the pulling down of holy shrines in Medina. (b) In matter® relating to the general policy of Ibn 3a»ud, the '’Iraq' has been rather condemnatory in its tone, the Istiqlal gave publication to information and views creditable to Ibn 3a*ud and the Zaman put up on one occasion a strong defence of Ibn 3a’ud as a great servant of the irab cause. The bahdha (a Shi*ah newspaper) was , as can be expected, conderanatory. In this connection it may be pointed out that \z-Zaman, which put up such a defence of Ibn Sa’ud, was intimately connected with huri Tasha al Sa’id, a minister of the ’Iraq Government and a recognised favourite of His majesty Hing Faisal. (c) in dealing with rumoured attempts by Bajd agrents for wining Zubairis to Nald nationality and with Akhwan attacks on ’Iraq territory, no one can ^reasonably expect the ’Iraq press to be less violent against Ibn Sa’ud. In the mean time it may be pointed out that in the early stage of the recent series of Akhwan attacks, the ’Iran press was almost unanimous in trying to disassociate IbniU Ibn Ca’ud and lay the blama solely on the lawish, calling upon the former to hold hie rebellious followers! in checic. On the whole it may be said that in a comparatively progressive country like Irao, with laws providing for the freedom of the press, no check within the law could have been exercised on the press in view of the provocation received. ithin the last six months a secftion of the press in ’Iraq has been considerably more offensive against both the Iraq and the British Governments than against Ibn Sa’ud.T HHBfiMHfiflttMil It a l bj Telegram ( 0 ).

Action suggested would definitely link Kuwait with ♦Iraq in Ibn Baud’s mind and points are, first, whether (a) with present Iraq strained relations this is desirable in Kuwait interests or (b) at any time in furtherance of our future policy, second, whether Air and Iraq present necess- -ities are sufficient to outweigh other political consider- -ations. • /Cuwait’s commercial prosperity depends upon Nejd and the town is stagnant owing to Ibn Baud’s embargo on transit trade with Nejd: this is one of the subjects I hope to get settled with Ibn Baud when I meet him. Ibn Baud is already sore over Kuwait but with added irritation of aero- -planes stationed in Kuwait taking action on behalf of Iraq against distant objectives in Nejd this soreness will necessarily become enmity without corresponding benefit to Kuwait. The advantage of Ibn Baud learning that Kuwait has adequate support is, I think, outweighed by the position which would arise, and which I think would only be permissibl if our relations with Ibn Baud were definitely ruptured. In jox writing to Ibn Baud 1 stated that I felt sure that a meeting w&amp;a with him wo old put an end to present unfortunate conditions: in replying he has taken up this point and says that he is in full agreement with this and that unquestionably a meeting will have the effect of ending present difficulties. Kith the bad case which he ] has at present I would in his position myself play for time before having the meeting.Until then meeting takes place or uefiniteip is not to take place 1 would take no action to make our relations more difficult except such as is obviously necessary for protection of Kuwait and Iraq frontiers. Raids though regrettable have occurred from all time and thus with regard to second point 1 would urge that however irritating they are they should for the? moment be met by temporary or tactical methods and should not be regarded as sufficiently important to affect out permanent policy. The gradual tightening up of Iraq defence methods and the line of forts will ultiraatily assure the permanent safety of the frontier. Kuwait is under Hie Majesty’s Government’s protection and I think it is important that this point should remain clear and that nothing which might link Kuwait with Iraq in minds either of Ibn Baud, Shaikh of Kuwait or Iraq should be contemplated if avoidable even though to us it only appears that out Air force is taking action. mKUDFN?.^elegram From Political Heaident, Bushire. fj’Q Secretary of State for Colonies, London, .no. 18* Repeated Coyernment of India, New Delhi f No. 138.

Otherwise they will be of comparatively little value against such an exceptionally mobile foe. Furthermore, I would point out that aeroplanes from ’Iraq and the Neutral Zone habitually do cross the frontier, and that consequently it is in the best interests of the Shaikh of Kuwait that they should do so from here too, so uhat it will appear that they are not specially helping him but our part of our general plan.

The best method of securing this is to obtain the earliest possible warning of an intended attack, and in view of the extreme mobility of the Ikhw&amp;n this cannot be done effectively if reconnaissances be limited to Kuwait territory. It seems to me that the objective of yesterday®s raid must have been Zubalr, and this can only mean that the Ikhwan are desperate for supplies, and, as it has failed it seems likely that they will try this side next unless they have been too heavily punished in the present instance.

M« -h.TRANSLATIOH ih&lt;» ii*iri#ncy, q) February, 1928. Your Majesty, I haT# Your ^aji*8ty , «t letter ^q. B 4i. 27^-% dated the 2bth Jus adi IX, 1346, (eorreapondinf to nooeubor 22nd, 1927} on the subject of the Dahamshafe tribe. In tha first place X feel euro that ¥our ^aleety* 8 otat^ent that the Liuh%•!*£«rah treaty was not »lined by both parties, is based on a Kileapprohen- sion. a- he fact is that two copies sij ned by hi® hajeety hlng Faisal were handed to Your majesty at Uoair; one of them was retained by Your majesty, while the other was signed by Your a.ajesty and returned to the ' Iraq delegate, and i® now in the archives of the * Iraq Government. Xhe pre^ble to th&lt;? Lahra agreement also sets forth that the uhamiuer&amp;h treaty was ratified by both parties. Secondly, Your majesty su* I eats that the Muhiusmarah treaty has been replaced by the Uqalr protocols. ut it is definitely stated in the first protocol that that protocol i® appended to the c.uhaitarserah treaty, not that it is in substitution for it, and the mention of the treaty in the Sahra k.S' agreement proves conclusively that it is still infore*. Further, Your 'tould never have signed the erah treaty at to air had it be ?n intended that the treaty should be replaced by the protocols *?hich •were th^n beir.| diecuered. Mot only i^ the treaty «till in force, but this fact has bean fully recofni^ed by Your aalesty on several occasions* Mk the conference which was held at Kuwait at the end of 1J25 constant reference to the treaty was made by Your majesty*s delegatee* +n Your jes ty 1 b letter Mo. h dated the 21 et of BegT* 1^23 (5th Shawal 1341), reference was made to the treaty and the expulsion of certain «ajd Sha&amp;mar from ’Iraq was deuianded on the ground that this was necessary under the treaty. Xt is therefore beyond doubt not only that the treaty was ratified by both parties, but that it is still in force and that this fact has hitherto been recognised by lour majesty. * ibis be inf. so the an v.saah, who are of the toarat, as is we11 known and indeed has npver been denied by Your Xmjesty, are under the treaty of -uhaiuaerah subjects of ’Iraq, and are therefore specifically excluded fro??* the operation© of Article 1 of the second protocol, which as has already bean pointed out to lour majesty can only apply to tribes which were not, at the tiue of the signing of that protocol, subjects of either trie Majc or the ’Iran Government* In view of this provision, which was specially inserted at the request of the ’Iraq Govern ment, it is clear that that vrticle cannot have been intended to apply to the Bahaaehah. It was, on the other. I other hand f int ended to apply to m&gt; trib js ^ho were at the time in Syria or iran•Jordanin, and under the goverm, ente of those countries and who might wi»h in the future to transfer their alleg iance either to Xour majesty or to the ’Iraq Oovern.,.ent. 3. vs ref irds ibn ijlad, so lonf as he remains with his tribe he is an ’Iraq subject, but the ’Iraq Government will, as was stated to tour majesty at toair, and repeated to the Kajd delegates at Kuwait, raise no objection to his go inf to llajd md b-co ; ing a ..la Id subject. they would however in that case overeise the right w hich they possess, under the^own laws, of reducing to allow him again to enter ’Iraq. 4* is has already been intiMtod to four majesty the camels raided by the Buqur will be returned as soon as those taKan from them by ibn i iflad have been received by thma.

We very much appreciate the desire of the British Government to bring matters to an understanding, we always endeavour to keep on an understanding with the British Government. We regret, however, that it is not possible for usin the near future to fix a time for our meeting as we are not keeping well on account of cold we are now having and secondly owing to the heavy work now at Bajd which we ought to do, and which requires settling and finishing up. As regards the information conveyed in the message about the attack of Dawish on A1 Ghalidh of Bani Hukaim near Urbaibah in the neutral zone, this attack was not against ’Iraq and was not felt by the 'Iraq Government but we consider it to be an attack against us and we felt it more than the &gt;Iraq Govern- ment. The situation in Hajd after the recent actions of the 'Iraq Government has changed a great deal and it does not allow us to do all that we want and desire, we will give the reasons here for this situation which we want to be conveyed to the Hon'ble the Political Resident for the information of His Majesty's Government so that when a meeting takes place between us and His Honour he will be in possession of all the necessary instructions in this matter and their details. we do not want to conceal it from you that there is no man, woman or child in Hajd who was not very much dis appointed owing to the building of Busaiyah and similar other forts by the 'Iraq Government. And the next disappointment that followed it was due to two sections of the 'Iraq Government, First they ('Iraq) welcomed the criminals whom we wanted to punish on account of the 'Iraq Government as they have done in the past in the case of xusuf As-Sadun and his Hajdi followers and as they did recently in the case of Bin Mijlad when we punished him on account of 'Iraq. He ran away to them and they gave him a shelter and offered him help, secondly the coming of the 'Iraq officials in cars and mixing with our tribes and asking them to run away from our country(control) and instigating them to cause trouble in our country. For this reason the Hajd people felt it very/- 3 - / 2» very much., when we wan't lio send 'them iio punish the Dawish they say ”We do not disobey your orders but the 1 Iraqis are the people who deserve it as they contravened the agreement.' Secondly if we were to punish the hawish he would run away to t and there the ’ Iraq people would shelter him, then what have we done ? This is the situation at Eajd about those who are at A1 Hadud. Therefore there are three way to settle this dispute and we then accept any responsibility which may arise should the ’ Iraq Government carry them out regularly, ij'irst Article 3 of the Protocol should be observed and the Busaiyah fort should be pulled down with others, secondly ooth parties undertake not to accept any criminal coming from the country of the other party whatever his crime may be. Third the 1 Iraq Government should undertake to prevent the visit of any motor car, aeroplane or man from mixing with our tribes with the intention of creating trouble and we undertake to observe the same. if any agreement is arrived at on these three articles the situation will be quite clear and everything will be settled. We would also be able to punish the big and smaj.1 in our country and recover all that they have plundered and make them pay for it and punish for all that they have done. This is a statement that we have put up before the British Government as preliminary for the coming meeting. Should this he agreed upon X hope hy the will of God it will all remove^the trouble. m all masters we are extremely anxious that good relations should exist between us and our friends, his Britannic majesty’s Government.

It was on realising the success of this defence with the? aid of motor cars that the idea of a small perman ent motor defence force for Kuwait occurred to my mine, ‘‘■aids are as a rule made by comparatively small bodies of men, say 200 to 500 # and the possession of two or three motor cars,armed againet rifle fire, carrying: machine guns anu j^ewie guns, would completely checkmate the raiding tribes, who with their limited speed would not care to come far inside the border. Men on camels would be an easy target for machine guns. 'he expense XtoBsxmz&amp;amx of upkeep would be small and the men for the machine guns if not already obtainable could be trained either in India or Iraq.

Reports regarding events in X'lejd are very confused: one from Kuwait pointing to pr*ictical abandonment of Ibn Baud’s efforts against Bawish and others to preparations for encircling him and starving him out. Lean while Air -’or ce operations have been strikingly successful in so far as immediate object of protecting ’Iraq tribes from Butair raids is concerned, but they have not yet inflicted much damage on Butair, v/ho are still able to graze to South in ARTAWIYAH neighbourhood. It appears.to me appearance of aeroplanes over ARTAWIYAH and dropping warnings to the effect that any further incursion by Bawish will be followed by bombing of that place might now have i menoc effect upon Hejd tribes and make them think that it will be unsafe for them to raid ’Iraq in future. Ahether flight of aeroplanes as far south as ARTAWIYAH would increase Ibn Baud’s indignation at violation it is of his frontier, or his difficultie* with his people, l&amp;tlK difficult to say. My own view is that when we have once risked his indignation by crossing frontier we should now take fuil- -est possible advantage of it and that since we cannot indef- -initely prolong operations we ought to see that they do not close without some striking demonstration of our power. 1 shall be glad to know whether you concur with the foregoing views.

It is perhaps inevitable if not indeed necessary that I should viev,' matters from a different standpoint from ♦Iraq. It appears to me, as 1 have already said in my telegrams Nos. 4 and 17, that Ibn Baud and not local tribes is the matter and the only matter to be considered. I hold the opinion that tribes are a side issue and at that affecting local rather than Imperial policy. Disgruntling Ibn Baud is likely to affect us very considerably on every face of Arabia and to effect this for the sake of punishing an Arab tribe for raiding appears to me an act of bombing our own main policy for a point of little permanent import- -ance. ^he destruction of the Busaiyah post was a serious matter for which the ultimate responsibility had to come home to Ibn Baud and until we found he could do nothing I think we should have kept to our side of the frontier, us neglecting the fact that local tribes think xx absurd to consider frontiers. How that Ibn Baud has disbanded the troops he was raising for punishing the Mutair the question assumes a new phase and I personally consider we should, while taking every precaution for defence against raids, wait till we see what line Ibn Baud proposes to take. T see no object in taking aggressive action until we do know. Our object is to come to a permanent settlement and I hope that Ibn Baud will tejum still keep his engagement for/ 2 for a meeting. Our desire is to maintain our friendship with him as long as he Keeps his side of his agreements and it is to our advantage to do so. If no satisfactory result is achieved we can then tell Ibn Saud that unless he can prevent raids and punish raiders we have no option but to adopt aggressive methods in self defence, and we can then adopt them. As regards Kuwait 1 do not think that bombing tribes vail help us in the general economic question. This matter rests upon our relations with Ibn Baud and bomb- -ing is likely to make him stiffen his embargo not to relax it. Evidence suggests that this embargo is hitting local tribes as much as Kuwait and this needs further enquiry as effecting future policy we could bring to bear on quest- -ion.

Political Resident, Bushire.) Dated £2nd received 2'6rd February 1928. Deference Bushire telegrams ending with No. 32 to you dated February 20th and Delhi telegram no. 384-8 of February 2ist. 1 need not remind His Majesty’s Government that we are dealing jsxxh not with problem of petty frontier raids but with critical situation certain to affect decision upon what is perhaps most weighty project now under consideration within British Bmpire and its dependencies, namely combined pipe line and railway from Baghdad to Mediterranean. ’’his probably &amp;Jt transcends in importance not only questions of arranging aeroplane flights from Basra along the southern shores of the Gulf to India but even possibility of temporary effervescence among Indian Lhilafatists. If some means cannot be devised of controlling or checking incursions of Nejd tribe Mutair, whose last raid beginning on February 20th is reported by Hoyal Air Force still engaged in attacking raiderts, as 1200 strong, whole de’sert at least as far north as line from RIT.'BAH to DAMASCUS will become untenable, and pipe line and railway must take northern route through Syrian territory. 'his will probab^ ✓ mean great loss to British basic trades, ruin of Haifa and blow at prosperity of Palestine besides preventing British Mediterranean fleet from using the oil in the event of any future hostilities in which ’ranee is neutral. 'Ians of oil companies and capitalists are almost matured and decision as to route must probably be taken within the next few months. Comparatively ''' ■ W 12 a ^ 3.1/ Comparatively minor problem but one of eon- -siderable importance is discharte of our obligations to defend Iraq and Kuwait and r 'ransjordania and to guard against possibility, which with these very strong bodies of raiuers may at any time become serious, of holy cities Hajaf and \ Karbala being laid waste by Wahabis, as occurred in early 19th bentury. Hecent series of completely unprovoked raids began early in November and have continued with unprecedented ferocity and cruelty up to the present. ttern protest by His Majesty s Government reached Ibn Baud at the beginning of ecember and it was only after nearly two months delay, after it became evident that the Kut&amp;ir tribe was out of ibn Caud’s control and after declaration by paramount thaiich of Iraq 'nezeh that unless emergent action were taken his tribe, dominating deserts between Mesopotamia and hediteeeanean, must either become Akhwan or take refuge in Cyria, that Ifis Majesty's Government decided on air operations against rebel tribe in Hejd territory. 1 had myself suggested warning to Ibn Gaud that if he did not regain control within a fixed period Gulf orts would be las blockaded but His Majesty’s Government preferred alternative which they took. V’esult of operations has been that raiders have had their favourite and least vulnerable line of access to Iraq denied to them and have been forced to attack, as in the last raid, along route which has exposed them to reprisals in which they hax are believed to have suffered heavily. Meanwhile loss of control by Ibn Gaud has become more patent than ever. lie has been obliged to disband mixed force which he had raised against Mutair and to abandon combination against them which he had hoped to bring about. He has covered his failure by violent protests against His Maj* sty’s Government’s policy of attacking the rebel tribe within Hejd territory, a policy similar to that years several times adopted in recent jp&amp;suus by the Government of India towards Persia when Persian Baluchistan tribes have raided3 J7J raided British territory and r’ersiar) Government has been powerless to punish them. It may be argued that British and Iraq, forces should be able to preserve peace of desert by defensive measures within Uesopotaiaia, but with vast line of desert o r en like ocean to pirates who cun pick and choose lines of attack and retreat, only remedy is as with pirates in China or Algiers, to rout them out in their isutxx bases, if they think their bases secure nothing will prevent con- -tinuance of raiding. if therefore Ibn Caud continues to be powerless against the raiders ( and there appears no other prospect; and if His Majesty's Government were to reverse the policy of aerial attacks within Hejd territory the only alternatives would be either to declare blockade against ftejd ports and thus bring pressure to bear on whole Uejd Government without penetration into Jazirat-al-Arab or to permit and instigate Mesopotamian tribes to revert to &amp;ld habit oc ouunter-ruids into Hejd and so deprive Hejd raiders of security within the! own territory. ''his would throw whole desert into con- -fusion and would in view of ill-regulated nature of Et7?KK3c% tribal warfare rapidly involve OLher ttejd tribes which had hitherto been friendly to Great Britain and Mesopotamia. 1 agree that personal discussion with Ibn Gaud might ao some good in so far as it might convince him of the reasonableness of His Majesty’s Government’s attitude but it is not likely to increase his power of controlling Akhwan tribes and this is the essence of the whole question. HIGH COMttinHIOir R.p. Telegram From Political Agent, Bahrain. To Political Resident, Bushire. No. 75. Dated 23rd received 24tji February 1928. Letter of February 18th from fbn Baud acknovsf- -ledges my despatch No. 54. He says h® wanted this sort of reply before High Commissioner sent aeroplanes across his border to 'trample” article 6 of Bahra agreement and articles 6 and 10 of Jeddah Treaty. Officials in Mesopotamia and Mesopotam -ia have broken written treaties. What is fault of Harb, Shammar and Anezeh, who live in North-west of his country, that aeroplanes maltreat them daily while Bawish did as he liked in Mesopotamia for many days ? Only explanation is that creation of new trouble for Nejd was intended. Nejdis have become like Dawish and no longer respect treaties with Mesopotamia, which has deliberately broken firstly, paragraph 2 of Article 1 of Mohamaerah treaty, secondly. Article 3 of Uqair Protocol, thirdly, Articles i, 4, 5 and 6 of Bahra/ Agreement. Nejdis think that the Government which has already broken six undertakings will not hesitate to break another by the acceptance of Dawish. He had given Dawish partial punishment and had promised to give full on a condition to which he had added two others when action of Mesopotam- -ian Government destroyed all hope that he had built find removed all excuses which he was putting before his people. He can see no way out of present difficulties except if Central British Government makes inquiry about person responsible for recent action in Mesopotamia, throws responsibility on him and will from their siae restore confidence of people in undertakings.0r tte is still doing his best to pacify his people owing to his belief that His Majesty’s Government will not permit their oldtime friendly relations with Kejd to be threatened by some self-interested agitator. If His Majesty’s Government will not take necessary steps early he will not be responsible for the result. Tnds.

But 1 would submit our policy fiiso turns upon one other point; can aeroplane action finally deal with tribes engaged in raids ? Is it not true as suggested in Baghdad telegram* ftos. 93 and 104 that u&gt; get effective action they must attack bases except in such rare c see as they can find tribes in close formation and id it not natural instinct of tribes to scatter at sight of aeroplanes ? If this is true arid punitive action other than defeating a raid always entails the envisaging of raids on bases in fejd will this not entail the accidental killing of women Jind children ? If so it might defeat its object and should be used only as a final necessity.

Responsibility must be left to ibn faud in any case until it is clear that he is unwilling or unable to discharge it. Recent air operations in J*ejd territory were authorised because it was understood no other means were immediately available of preventing defection of Iraq ^niaeh which was imminent.

It is not clear whether HARB tribe, who have hitherto been particular supporters of Ibn Baud, have declared against him but it is hardly con- -eeivable that they should do so. 1 fear in these circum- •stances message now to be despatched from Bushire v^ill be as chaff before the wind but there can be no harm in its going. If Ibn Baud is „as Kuwait raessape indicates, com- •polled to associate himself with Jehad we may have to deal with forces of anything between thirty and fifty thousand men, such as aseembled during confused fighting of ninties when ^urks were supporting Ibn Rashid, see 11th edition Encyclopedia Britannica, Volume II, page 269. ’these may be launched from central position against Kuwait, Basra, railway between Basra and Rasiriyah, Kerbela and Hajaf, Anezeh tribe and Amman or Maan and Akaba.

In 1914 he declared himself on the side of the Allies and against the ^’urks and fought some what feebly against Ibn Haehid durirr the whole war, receiving large subsidies from Hie Britannic Majesty’s Government# 'The defeat of Turkey in 1918 increased his power and weakened that of Ibn hashid. Throughout 1921 he fought Ibn Rashid and finally took Hail in Movember of that year. In 1922 he claimed suzerainty over the ’Iraq Anaizah and in March 1922 permitted an attack upon the ’Iraq desert camel corps and shepherd tribes*x'' C&amp;VZi^d&amp;i) Th&amp;iistf), /V&amp; 6 ^£&gt; &lt;x/£*~ ^Ha $J tribeSB Ift the same year he assorted Jauf* and in the spring of 19S3 advanced to some outlying districts of the Hijaz* In Septemter 1924 he took Taif, the summer capital of the Hijaz and in October 1924 Mecca, In 1925 he established suzerainty over Aeir and in -December 1925 he took Medina and Jiddah, the latter tribes and especially the Mutair under Faisal al Dawish and to prevent their raiding into »Irao.

Since then his by these three great tribes of a jihad against all which has been in progress for nearly three years. It is a natural consequence of Ibn Sa f ud»s having found himself confronted by the walls of settled frontiers and by the restrictions of treaties after an uninterrupted series of conquests lasting for 15 years* As soon as he had to pause and consolidate and forbid raids, hie power waned, because it has been nourished only on fanaticism and plunder, I doubt whether this weakening of his influence was seriously, if at all, hastened by the intervention of the British Air Force in the Mutair territory, which was indeed occasioned by the loss of his control over the &amp;utair, 4* The best that can now be hoped for is that the Karb tribe will cling to Ibn Sa f ud and that he will oppose in arms the three tribes of the Mutair, Ataibah and Ajman under Ibn i^awieh and his associates. It is after a long $&lt;L£ge* Meanwiiile, in , progressive pressure had been brought to bear on Ibn Sa’ud to control the Akhwan a» taidan ibn iithl&amp;in of the Aj can met and swore © position has never been very secure and the declaration non-Akhwan persons is only the culmination of a movement moremore likely that he will he forced to join Itn Danish with the H&amp;rh and will 'become a complaisant ally, whike remaining meminally suizerain* In that event we must expect very big forces numbering to thirty or forty thousand to swoop down on any weak points of the peri meter of Central Arabia and the earliest point of attack is likely to be Kuwait, The Kijaz will be treated to great severity and the approaching pilgrimage will pre sumably become impossible# 6 , &amp;e may assume that the Boy&amp;l Air Force will be able to cope with any conceivable attack on ^raq, though three or four consecutive days of gales and bad visi bility may at any time throw them out of gear and n ake the unheralded approach of a large force possible, 1 ut we cannot hope to abolish the Akhwan threat by this means. The only chance of repeating in the twentieth century the collapse of the Wahabi power which Mehemet All of Egypt brought about by military penetration at the beginning of the nineteenth century ^eems to be a complete blockade by sea. Central Arabia cannot feed itself and if the Akhwan tribes starve within a ring fence and cannot burst out, they will in the end bo forced to fight among themselves for the food remaining inside. Then will come the opportunity for Ibn Sa’ud or some other sane person to recover control. Until that point is reached, somewhat expensive measures of defence and reprisal all along the outside of the ring fence will be needed. 6 , If the Akhwan turn more fanatical then ever and prevent the pilgrimage, there is reason to suppose that Indian Moslem sentiment will be opposed to a blockade even of the Hijaz ports, (Id) H.D, 25/11/28,■MB HOTi OH COIIVSHCATIGH FBTWKEH THb HIG !r COf^IS^XCHBR AHD ZHAlKH HKWXm WAKB A Oil TH ^ 7TH OF JANOAI^b 19^' 4 1H TH&amp; gMSB UCB O?

Thera was mention of the intrigues of •the two brothers* by which expression, the Shaikh said. King Faisal an?? the Amir * Abdullah were meant. 2. I replied that it war useless to deny that is Lajesty King Faisal was for family and historical reasons not personally friendly to Ibn Sa*ud. He could not be expected to be so; and it was true, I said, that two years ago there had been some encouragement to petty refugees from JSajd on the part of tho Pal act. But that was all long ever. The Bhammar refugees who came originally from Hail had been for a long time strictly restrained and the &amp;utair refugees had been driven north with such severity that many had since returned to Bajd. King Faisal, how. ever, much as he might be personally eold towards Ibn Sa’ud, had loyally abided by the policy of preventing raids in recent years, and there had been no foundation lately for complaints of instigation. 3. Tho Shaikh replied that this might be so; but the real difficulty lay in the refusal of ’Iraq to extradite Majd criminals taking refuge in ’Iraq.
