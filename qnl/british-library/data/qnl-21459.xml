After the successful operations in the vicinity of Bushire in February, 1857, Lieut.-General Sir J. Outram left General Jacob in command at Bushire and sailed on 18th March with an ex pedition to Muhammareh, which it was proposed to occupy with a view to further operations in the interior of Persia. The expe dition was composed as follows :— Cavalry (392). Tro0 p 8 . Two batteries of Artillery. Two British Infantry battalions. Two Native Infantry battalions and details. Total 4,887 of all ranks and 12 guns. Conveyed in eight transport. „ Steamers—“ Feroze”, “ Semiramis ”, ‘ Assaye ”, “ Aidaha ”, Naval Squad- Victoria”. , ron. Sloops—“Clive”, “Falkland”, “Berenice”. Under the command of Commodore Young, I.N, The Persian force holding Muhammareh was under the command of the Shahzada and consisted of about 13,000 men (of which about 7,000 were regular troops). The chief defences of Muhammareh were two batteries, one on each side of the entrance to the Hafar Channel from the' tWoiT ? ’ i? get he r with several minor works further up that channel on the north side. ^ T !l ' ’jl® 6 nort h and south batteries were powerful open earth- S212(wTGSB a3em ra9Ure8- The lament is not*fai- dXftJl /?* -'«r~ &gt; il*r ’vie 1 ' m stated. The sixteen 12, 9, and 6-pr. guns and one mortar found here when the Persians abandoned the works were probably- supplemented by the field guns of the Persian army. The following is a brief summary of the British operations :— 24th March. —Steamers towing transports assembled after dark at rendezvous .3 miles below entrance to Hafar Channel. Batteries reconnoitred during night. Two islands (the “ Dub- bees ”, no longer existing in 1903) close to west bank of Shait-al- ’Arab, examined and found unsuitable for proposed mortar battery. 25ih March. —Raft constructed and armed with two 8-inch and two 5 J inch mortars. Horses and guns of artillery, portion of cavalry and infantry transhipped into boats and small steamers in readiness for landing. During the night mortar raft towed by the “ Comet ” into position under cover of Dubbee Island opposite the entrance of the Hafar Channel; being unobserved, movement not molested. 26thMarch .—Mortars on raft, manned by artillery, opened fire at dawn on the north and south batteries , only the 8-inch mor tars proved effective. “ Semiramis ” (with “ Clive ” in tow) and “ Ajdaha ” moved into west channel to support mortar raft. On fire from forts si ,okening, remainder of squadron moved up east channel of Shatt-al-’Arab and also engaged forts. “ Semi ramis”, “Clive” and “Ajdaha” then withdrew from west channel and joined the other vessels in close attack on forts. Supposed position of Persian camp was also bombarded (after wards discovered, with effect). At 7.45 a.m. batteries were only able to reply from three or four guns. Between 9 and 10 a.m. transports, with about 1,400 troops and followers, were brought up the east channel past the squad ron engaging the forts, fortunately without loss. Troops dis embarked, covered by fire from “ Feroze ” and “Ajdaha” at a point on east bank of Shatt al-’ArS,b about 2,000 yards above north battery. Landing parties from “Semiramis”, “Clive”, “Victoria” and “ Falkland ” then drove the Persians from north and south batteries. Landing of troops completed by 1.30 f.m. Advance at once made on Persian entrenched camp. On approach of Britishforce Persian army retreated precipitately, abandoning enor mous quantities of stores. For want of sufficient cavalry British pursuit ineffective. Very few casualties among the troops. Naval casualties only 5 killed and 18 -wounded. This slight loss due to the fact that all vessels engaged used trusses of compressed hay to give additional protection to the crews. On March 28th, 300 men with 6 howitzers left Muhammareh in 3 steamers to destroy the enemy’s magazines at Ahwaz. On April 1st, the howitzers shelled the enemy, who were found 8,000 strong on the right bank opposite Ahwaz, while the rest of the force entered Ahwaz, which was held by only 500 Persians. The enemy, being worn out, and half-starved owing to their hasty retreat, offered no resistance. On April 3rd the small force started back, and arri\ ed at Muhammareh the same day. The force withdrew from Muhammareh on May 16th, 1857. THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN MESOPOTAMIA. The political situation in Baghdad and Mesopotamia is intimately connected with that in the Persian Gulf. During the 19th century the British gradually built up for themselves a special position in the Persian Gulf and in Lower Mesopotamia. Great Britain undertook and maintained single-handed:— 1. The suppression of the slave-trade and piracy. 2. The preservation of peace and the development of trade in the Persian Gulf. 3. The opening up of the Tigris and Euphrates to navi gation. 4. The survey of the coasts and rivers and the production of navigation charts, sailing direction, etc. At the end of the 19th century the British occupied a paramount position at Baghdad and held practically a. mono poly of the navigation of the Tigris. Almost the whole of the trade of these regions was in British hands. In 1910, 87 per cent, of the trade of the Persian Gulf was still British. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, great changes have come about—changes so great that our position at Baghdad has been seriously challenged.4 The main factors which have produced these changes have been the building of the Baghdad Railway and the advent to power of the Young Turkish Party. Intrigues with In 1908 the Young Turkish Party rose to power and embark ed on a policy in the Baghdad region and in the Persian Gulf, which was most markedly aggressive and inimical to British interests. Although in 1901 the Turkish Government had agreed to recognise the status quo in the Persian Gulf, it now proceeded to intrigue with the Shaikh of Kuwait, and tried by many offers to induce him to accept Turkish nationahty. The Shaikh, however, stood loyally by his agreements of 1899 and 1907 with the British Government. Intrigues - Turkish intrigues against the Shaikh of Muhammareh Of Muhamma “ &lt; ;] 1 ] I “ nated ' m °P en use of force in April 1910, but this affair was re jj # tided over. Turkish petty annoyances. Not content with this the Turks pursued an aggressive policy in the Qatar peninsula and the Trucial coast, occupied the island of Zakhnuniyah, and even went so far as to put forward shadowy claims over the ? Oman, peninsula, Masqat, and even Gwadar on the Baluchistan coast. These intrigues were coincident with the efforts of Germany to strengthen her commercial position in the Persian Gulf. Nearer home the Turks seized every pretext to pick a quarrel with the British. . The Turks objected to the use of the British flag on the two original Tigris steamers belonging to Messrs. Lynch and Com pany, and at Baghdad itself took exception to the following exist ing British privileges:— (i) The sepoy guard on the British Residency. (ii) The presence of the R. I. M. S. “ Comet ” flying the British flag, for the special use of the Resident. (in) The size of the British Residency and grounds at Baghdad. 5 I n August 1910 the offices of Messrs. Lynch and of Messrs. Abdul ’Ah (a British Indian firm) were demolished on a false pretext of danger to the public, in order to avoid the payment of compensation. In September 1910 British Indian property at Kadhimain and Karbala was similarly demolished.5 have ntto bark- Gulf, ritish had now d by 3 of iareh rwas ssive upied put t, and many If. ick a e two Com- &gt; exist- mg the esideufc. ©(is at Messrs, a false jayment property The attitude of the Turks towards foreigners in general, and to the British in particular, underwent a very marked change for the good in 1912. The defeat of Turkey in the Balkans also greatly changed the political situation, for the rise of a strong Balkan hegemony whilst it weakened Turkey in Europe, also had the effect of barr ing to Germany the direct road to Constantinople and Turkey in Asia, which, rumour had it some years ago, Germany intend ed to colonise. Turkey’s defeat in the Balkans led to widespread lawlessness in 1912 in the Muntafik country and in Kurdistan, in which province the outbreaks w T ere said to have been fostered by the Russians. Another result of the weakening of the Central Government was the decline in popular favour of the Committee of Union and Progress and the founding at Baghdad, in January 1912, of a local branch of the Committee of Freedom and Accord, which was opposed to the former. In Basrah the anti-Turkish feeling has been still more marked. In June 1913 the Turkish Commandant of Troops -was assassi nated by Arabs, and it was feared that there would be a general Arab rising. Disturbances continued in Basrah till March 1914, but the rising did not come to a head. The execution of part of Sir W. Willcocks* irrigation scheme for Mesopotamia was entrusted to Sir John Jackson and Company. The first section of this scheme, the construction of the Hindiyah barrage, was completed in 1914. NEIGHBOURING PRINCIPALITIES. The following short history of neighbouring tracts affords an insight into political relations of the Turks with their neigh- bours. Kuwait. Kuwait is a tract of country of somewhat uncertain bound aries directly administered by the Shaikh. He has independ ently contracted obligations from time to time with the British Government, and this, the latter maintain, he is quite justified in doing ; the lurks on the other hand, do not admit this.

Irrigation in Mesopotamia.6 The family of the present Shaikh, Mubarak bin Subah, originally dwelt in a small fort called Umm Qasr, at the head of the Khor ’Abdullah, whence, on account of acts of piracy, they were expelled by the authorities at Basrah at the end of the seventeenth century, with the result that they moved down to Kuwait Bay. For the succeeding two centuries, the history of Kuwait is mainly concerned with tribal alliances or feuds, into which the influence of the Wahabi* rulers from Riyadh or Hail entered from time to time, and it was not until 1871 that any direct contact with the Ottoman Empire first commenced. In that year ’'Abdullah bin Faisal, the ruler of Xajd/appea’cd to Midhat Pasha, the Wali of Baghdad, for assistance against ’Abdullah’s brother Sa’ud, who had possessed himself of A1 Qatar and Qatif, then under the rule of the Amirs of Xajd. 8a’ud had also, in the harbours of these localities, seized certain Kuwait ships, and had returned an evasive answer to the remonstrances of the then Shaikh of Kuwait. As a result of a conference between the Wali and the Shaikh, it was decided that they would co-operate with ’Abd dlah against Sa’ud. The latter was de feated and according to the Turkish account, the Shaikh placed himself under Turkish control, assumed the Ottoman flag and, by accepting the title of Pasha, acknowledged henceforth a certain subjection to Turkey. According to the Kuwait con tention, however, the Shaikh was merely granted the title of Pasha in return for services rendered, at the same time receiving grants of land in the neighbourhood of Fao, and a grant of money which was paid regularly until 1898. Kuwait now (1915) flies a flag of its own. From 1871 onwards to 1897, the question of the sovereignty of Kuwait arose in various forms, mainly on the general point of the repression of piracy on the Gulf Coast by British ships. In April 1897, Shaikh Mubarak failed in an endeavour to obtain from Turkey a recognition of independence, upon which he preferred a definite request for British protection. The British Government were at first not disposed to interfere, but in *A puritanical Moslem sect started by ’Abdul Wahab of Basrah, which, spread over the Arabian desert of Najd and the Nafud, and embraced the Jabat Shammar country to the north-east.1899 action was precipitated by the report of a Russian railway concession in Kuwait with the result that certain arrangements were entered into with the Shaikh. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the Shaikh had accepted the Turkish designation of Qann-Maqam,* which might perhaps be held to represent the holding of office under the Turkish Government, but this was explained as merely incidental to the possession of the Turkish property at Fao by the Shaikh. Subsequently a more difficult question arose through the endeavour of the Turks to appoint a harbour official at Kuwait; this led to a remonstrance from the British Government, and the subsequent removal of the official by the Turks. In the beginning of 1900, the first rumours arose as to the Baghdad railway project, and as it was reported that the German promoters would negotiate directly with the Sultan, for a conces sion of land in Kuwait Harbour to use as a terminus, without regard to the Shaikh, the British Government announced that, while they did not desire to interfere with the status quo or with the Sultan’s authority in those parts, they could not, having regard to their great interests in the Persian Gulf, view with indifference any action which would alter the existing condition of affairs or give another Power special rights or privileges over territory belonging to the Shaikh, with whom His Majesty’s Government had certain agreements. As a result probably of this attitude no mention was made in the subsequent railway convention as to any definite terminal port, bufj other events during 1901 and 1902 raised the Kuwait question to a somewhat acute stage. In 1901, the Shaikh attacked the Amir of Najd and the latter appealed to the Ottoman Government, which thereupon mani fested an intention of despatching troops to Kuwait. This was resisted by the British Government which announced its resolu tion to oppose by force any landing of troops in Kuwait territory. It was within a few weeks of this incident that Mubarak himself having asked for the presence of additional ships in the harbour, an official from Basrah visited Kuwait and informed the Shaikh that his assertion of independence was disapproved of by the Sultan, and that punishment must ensue if he did not make *Head of a qadha (administrative division of country in the Ottoman domi nions).v/m 8 his submission. To this communication, Mubarak, after consul tation with the Senior Naval Officer, replied that his relations with the Turkish Government were the same as they had always been, and later, upon representation by our Ambassador at Constantinople, the action of the Basrah official was disavowed. A more peremptory summons was, however, issued later in the year, which resulted in the Shaikh stating that he would have no option but to comply unless he was assured of British support. He was informed that the British Government would not tolerate any attack upon him by land or sea, and the Senior Naval Officer again received instructions to defend Kuwait, by force if necessary. To complicate matters further Ibn Rashid (probably instigated by the Turkish officials at Basrah) advanced towards Kuwait town, whereupon a provisional scheme of land defences was drawn up by the Senior Naval Officer in conjunction with the Shaikh, and some machine-guns and blue jackets were landed. The threatened attack, however, passed off, and the Porte again disavowed the action of its officials, only, however, during the next year, 1903, to occupy various more or less debatable points on the Kuwait boundaries with small posts of troops, i.e., Safwan, Bubiyan Island, Umm Qasr, and Warbah Island. The Turkish Government still exercises a certain pressure upon the Shaikh, presumably owing to his possessing private property at Fao and Basrah, but between the years 1903 and 1910 there was little to record in the way of interference with the rather vague “ status quo ” which has been already alluded to. The conception of this status quo, and the manner in which the question is now regarded by His Majesty’s Government, was stated by Sir E. Grey in the House of Commons on March 9th, 1911, in a debate concerning the new arrangements in contempla tion for the construction of the Baghdad-Persian Gulf section of the Baghdad Railway. His words were: “ We are not anxious to disturb the status quo in the Persian Gulf. To a great extent that status quo has been built up by us in previous genera tions. We have practically opened the Persian Gulf to trade and kept it open. That has been a matter of historical knowledge for years past. We are not anxious to have a forward policy in the Persian Gulf, to acquire new territory, or to disturb the status quo ; but if the status quo is going to be disturbed by others, then we must undoubtedly use our resources to maintain the position we have in the Persian Gulf. Part of the status quo is that wehave entered into treaty obligations with the Shaikh of Kuwait and in any negotiations which there may be, or in any changes which may take place, it is an obligation of honour with us to see that our treaty obligations towards the Shaikh of Kuwait in maintaining his position are fulfilled In 1914 this and other points of variance were on the point of being amicably settled. Al Hasa. South of Kuwait we come to the so-called “ Turkish pro vince of Al Hasa. This comprises the fertile district of Al Hasa proper, with its port of ’Oqair, the coast town and district of Qatif, and the fortified port of Al Bida’ (Dohah) on the eastern shore of the Qatar peninsula. It thus stretches from Kuwait south-east towards the country of the trucial Chiefs, and inland to the frontiers of Najd, and is often all described by the name of Al Hasa. It is only some 30 years since the Turks first obtained a footing in these parts. Up to 1871 the country was under the rule of the Wahabis, but in that year one of the Wahabi princes invoked the assistance of the Porte in a family quarrel, and since then the districts of Qatif and Al Hasa have never been without a Turkish garrison. In 1886 the troops quartered in the province only amounted to about 200 men ; since then the number gradually increased to 3,000, but was then reduced to 1,000, and in 1914 all except a small garrison at Dohah were evicted by Bin Sa’ud. Najd. Najd was, during the early part of the 18th century, the centre of the extensive Wahabi empire, which extended from Mecca to near Baghdad. Originally ruled by one Amir residing at Riyadh it gradually became split up by the intrusion of a Shammar prince from the north, and, after various alternations of power, it has now become resolved into two main zones of influence, i.e., that centering round Hail to the north, and that centering round Riyadh to the south. At Hail the ruling power is the Shammar dynasty of Ibn Rashid ; at Riyadh the original Wahabi dynasty of Bm Sa ud is predominant. Though, from the fact that they have undertaken military movements into these S212(w)GSB at various periods regions, the Turks10 profess to regard both the ruling Amirs as tributary to the Ottoman authority at Basrah, there is no doubt that whatever vestige of Turkish authority there may have been at any tiuio has now completely disappeared, and that both states enjoy an altogether independent status. The first appearance of the Turks was in 1818, when Muhammad ’Ali from Egypt, acting under instructions from the Porte, undertook a successful expedition against the Wahabi power. His garrisons remained there until 1831, when they were driv en from the country. The next incident occurred in 1871, when, as already related, Midhat Pasha, theWali of Baghdad, supported one of the claim ants to the Amirah', and obtained possession of the province of Al Hasa, which at that time belonged to the Wahabi power. In 1888, and again in 1904:-0r&gt;, between which periods the two rival Amirs were struggling for supremacy, the Turks despatched troops to the assistance of Ibn Rashid, the Shammar ruler, and on the latter occasion Turkish troops remained in occupation of various points between Hail and Riyadh. Garri sons were left in Qasim, ’Anaizah and Buraidah, and the Turks proceeded to divide the country into administrative districts. The troops, however, were left uncared for, with the result that they gradually dwindled away, and towards the end of 1906 all had disappeared. In the circumstances, therefore, it does not appear that the claim of the Turks to have established effective sovereignty, or even a protectorate, over Central Arabia could be substantiat ed ; on the contrary, it would seem that, in accordance with facts, the whole of this locality should be regarded as still independent of their authority. Between 1908 and the present date, intermittent fighting has proceeded between the followers of the two rival Amirs. Rumours arose during 1910 that the Ottoman Government intended again to interfere in Najd affairs, and that Ibn Rashid was in receipt of a subsidy from the Turkish authorities. Other rumours state that both Ibn Rashid and Bin Sa’ud are allied with the Shaikh of Kuwait to resist any Ottoman encroachment. In 1913 Bin Sahid rose in rebellion against the Turks, and summarily evicted all Turkish officials and all troops fromHofuf, Qatif and ’Oqair. He was later, in 1914, persuaded by the Porte to accept the position of Turkish Wali and Com mander, but he remained virtually independent. British position in the Gulp generally. British interests are closely concerned with the regulation of the Gulf in general. The following words defining the British Standpoint are quoted from a speech delivered by Viscount Morley (Acting Secretary of State for India), in the House of Lords, on 22nd March, 1911 :— “ If by any chance in negotiation our position in the Gulf is challenged this is the answer. That position has been described as unique. Great Britain ‘ has not sought territorial acquisi tion in these regions. She has for generations borne burd( ns there which no other nation has ever undertaken anywhere except in the capacity of Sovereign. She has had duty thrust on her without dominion. She has kept the peace amongst people who are not her subjects ; has patrolled during upwards of two centuries waters over which she has enjoyed no formal lordship. She has kept in strange ports an open door, through which traders of every nation may have as free access to distant markets as her own. If Great Britain has become in any sense arbiter and guardian of the Gulf, it has not been through any restless ambition urging her on to the control of the waste places of the earth, but in obedience to calls that have been made on her in the past to enforce peace between warring tribes, to give a free course to trade, and to hold back the arm of the marauder.’ That is our charter. It gives a true picture of our historical position. It is ov/ing to British enterprise, the expenditure of British lives and treasure, that the Persian Gulf is at this moment open to the navigation of the world, and to this cause alone it may be said that the seaborne trade of these regions owes ita very existence. ” In 1914, when war broke out, the British and Turkish Gov ernments were on the point of signing an agreement settling all the disputed points regarding the status of Kuwait, the Baghdad Railway and Navigation of the Shatt-al-’Arab. The terms of the agreement had been und^r discussion for over a year, and each lubject had been patiently threshed out.CHAPTER II. ' GEOGRAPHY. Boundaries. —The tract of country to be dealt with in this report comprises the locality commonly known as Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia as a whole is the lowland portion of the basin of the ancient Asiatic rivers Euphrates and Tigris, in contradis- tinction to the Armenian and Kurdistan hill country, which forms the high-lying portion of the basin, the dividing line between the two being found in the neighbourhood of Diarbekr. Mesopotamia itself can again be subdivided into Upper and Low er Mesopotamia, the former, Al Jazirah (the island between two rivers) extending south as far as Baghdad, and the latter, 'Traq-i- t Arabi continuing to the Persian Gulf. Our boundaries then for this report are Upper Mesopotamia, similar in character to Lower Mesopotamia, on the north, and the Persian Gulf on the south. The eastern boundary is the Turco-Persian frontier, which was demarcated in 1914. The approximate line, emerging from the watershed of a belt of high mountains east of Baghdad, runs along the foothills about 40 miles east of the Tigris to a little West of Muhammareh, where it joins the Shatt-al-’Arab. As regards the country on the west, we have the Arabian tableland, rising very gradually from the lowland, Euphrates country and without any definite line of demarcation between the authority of the Turkish Government and the spheres of the various independent or semi-independent Arab tribes and chief tains. Geographical features .—Between this western desert table land, rising to 1,000 feet at about 100 miles from the Euphrates, and the Persian hills on the east, nowhere is the country more than 100 feet above sea-level, and the whole Mesopotamian zone may be regarded as a northern extension of the Persian Gulf, which at one time probably reached almost to the Mediter- anean. The country has in fact gradually been filled in by the alluvia of the great rivers and the advancing sands of the desert, and owing to this geological origin, the soil is found everywhere to consist of a sandy clay, abounding in excellent agricultural properties and incapable of cultivation only where water fails. Its astounding fertility is sufficiently shown by the fact that it 12atill remains unexhausted after ha\ing supported the teeming populations of the Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian Empires and that Sir William Willcocks is of opinion that, if a proper System of irrigation control is once more put into force, the country can have in front of it a future ox prosperity equal to that which it enjoyed in ancient days. At the present time, owing to the w'ant of suitable control over the water and to the inertia of the inhabitants, the land so favour able for agriculture is, comparatively speaking, little cultivated, and the population relies mainly on the produce of its flocks and herds, for which there is good grazing in spring even in the so-called desert country. The main features of the region are the two rivers Euphrates and Tigris, which, together with their valleys, will be alluded to in detail later. These rivers approach fairly close to one another at Baghdad, and then turn apart to unite finally atGurmat ’Ali, below Qurnah. From Qurnah downwards the stream is known as the Shatt-al-’Arab. The junction used to be atQurnah, and the old channel of the Euphrates is still in existence, though the banks are for the most part destroyed and no Euphrates water enters the Tigris from it. Between Baghdad and Qurnah the main streams are connected by Several channels and intermittent water-courses, of which the chief are the Nahr ’Isa or Sakhlawiyah Canal (closed at its head on the Euphrates) and the Shatt-al-Hai. Around Qurnah and between ’Amarah and that place there are extensive marshes, but below Qurnah the Shatt-al-’Arab traverses a flat and fertile plain, dotted over wdth villages, and covered with artificially irrigated meadow lands and date groves. At Muhammareh (Persian territory), 40 miles above its mouth and 20 miles below Basrah the Shatt-al-’Arab is joined by the Karun from Persia, and here properly begins the delta, of which only one arm is navigable. For six months in the year this delta is converted into a swampy district, through the melting of the snows about the head-streams in spring and occasionally by the action of the autumn rains. From its mouth to Baghdad the main stream (Shatt-al-’Arab and Tigris) is navigable throughout the year for steamers of some size t (see page 93). The Shatt-al-Arab. The Shatt-al-’Arab is the river formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates above Basrah, and flowing into the Per sian Gulf at its north-west xrn extremity.14 From tho mouth to a point about eight miles above Muham- tnaroh it forms the Turco-Persian boundary. It is a fine river, 1| miles wide at tho mouth, and navigable as far as Basrah, by any vessels that can cross tho bar at the entrance. The land is very low on both sid-s of tho entrance, but differs much in appearance, that on the western side being fertile and thickly covur, d with date trees, that on the Persian side being on tho other hand comparatively bare, and barren for several miles up the river. There are two channels loading into the river en ranee, the eastern or Khor-al-Amaya, and the western Khor-al-Kafka. The latter is the principal channel, and is the one us^d by steam Vessels ; it runs between two large banks and across broad flats, which form the bar already alluded to. To cross the bar vessels drawing more than 13 feet must wait for the flood. At high spring tide (highest tides are night tide in winter, day tide in summer), vessels of 20 to 22 feet draught can enter ; at neaps the draught is 18. As tho mud is very soft, powerful steam vessels are often forced through a foot or more of it, and vessels load to the actual depth available at the bar. A later examination, however, of the bar, concluded in 1911, under the direction of the Commandor-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, indicates that at a moderate outlay of money the bar could be dredged so as to admit of the passage of vessels drawing up to 25 or 26 feet. Fao. Tho bar is about 2 miles from Ras-al-Bisha, the west ernmost point of the entrance, and 3| miles above Ras-al-Bisha is Eao, a village of about 400 inhabitants, and the late terminal station of the Turkish land telegraph line, connecting with the British cable (Indo-European) to Bushire and India. Eao has a rough stone landing jetty, with deep water a few yards from the outer end. There is a mud fort at Fao and in the neighbourhood, about 6,400 yards south-east of the telegraph station, is also an'un completed brick work. This is closed work in the shape of a blunted redan (but nearly rectangular) facing approximately south-east. It is now in ruins and overgrown with reeds, (See also page 133.) Having entered the river, the banks are very low on both sidse tho entire distance to Basrah, and are intersected bynumerous irrigation canals; the country is often under water except for small raised banks b -,tween the plantations. The belt or land near the river is exceedingly fertile and produces dates, vegetables and grain. This b dt extends from half-a-mile to 2 miles from the river bank ; behind is waste country or swamp. Largo herds of cattle roam along the, banks of the river. ✓ On the ebb the water is fr )sh and fit for drinking except in the autumn ; then the river is low and slightly brackish. Ten miles above Fao it is always fresh at low wat r. A landing anywhere near Fao is difficult, as the soil is soft alluvial mud. (See also page 109.) Considered as a possible site for a railway terminus, Fao, which lies inside the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab, has all the disadvantages and none of the commercial advantages of Basrah. The land on the eastern bank as far as Muhammareh is known as ’Abbadan island, being separated from the mainland by the Bahmanshir river, which runs from the Karun river at Muhammareh into the Gulf east of the Shatt-al- Arab. Fao to Kabda Point.— Kabda Point is the long rounded point on the west bank opposite to and about 2J miles above bhaliau Point on the chart. Previous to reaching this, Ma amir village is passed on the western bank, 7 miles above Fao, and further up Ad Dorah ; on the eastern bank a boat-creek runs off opposite k ao leading to the Bahmanshir, and above this is the large date grove of Qasabah. Shoal water extends from the eastern bank around Kabda Point. Kabda Point to Hajar channel {Karim river).-— In this reach there is shoal water around Dawasir island, and some diffi cult navigation by Muhalla island. The latter is formed by a shallow boat channel leading from Baraim village to Harta village on the eastern bank. Near the village of ’Abbadan, opposite the upper Dawasir island on the eastern bank, the Bahmanshir ben s in to within a distance of 1J miles. The refining works of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are situated on ’Abbadan Island. On the western bank above A1 Khast point is the village of Saiha, with a custom house ; from here on to the Hafar channel the country is open and devoid of plantations. From 400 to 1,600 yards south of the entrance of the Hafar channel, which leads to Mubammaroh and the Kanm river on the16 Persian side, the ship channel of the Shatt-al-’Arab is obstructed by a bar, which occasionally, between February and June, affords a very low depth of water. Rafar Channel to Basrah .—From abreast of this channel the navigation space of the river is obstructed by the low grassy Dabba island, 4^ miles long and occupying three-fourths of the river width. Opposite the southern end of this island is the village of Mutawa, and thence for 18 miles up to Basrah there is deep water, and from here date groves line both banks of the river. On the left bank is part of the Muhammareh district; and part of the Basrah Qadha. The margin of the river is covered by a practically continuous line of date-groves, having a depth inland of from \ to 2 miles. East of the date-groves is a flat low- lying alluvial plain, usually called desert, but it is fairly well watered, and consists to a great extent of grass or cultivable land. Infantry could march from Muhammareh to a point opposite Basrah, by keeping 2 or 3 miles inland from the bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab. The Shatt-al-’Arab would then have to be crossed to reach Basrah. Two streams and several muddy creeks would have to be crossed. The right or western hank of the river .—The margin of the river is covered by a practically continuous line of date-groves, having a depth inland of from | to 2 miles. There are some deep muddy creeks, some of which extend inland for a con siderable distance from the river Shatt-al-’Arab. There is a ten- foot tide in the lower Shatt-al-’Arab, which fills these creeks and probably any inland marshes, but exact information regarding these marshes is not available. West of the date-groves, the country is partly open desert and partly marshy as far as the Khor Zubair, an arm of the sea which runs up from Warbah island, northwards, and nearly parallel to the Shatt-al-’Arab, at a distance of 25 to 30 miles from it. The country between the river Shatt-al-’Arab and the Khor Zubair is believed to be not very suitable for the movement of troops, except along one good track, which runs along the edge of the desert, immediately behind the fringe of date-groves. {See Communica tions.) Much of this peninsula (on which Fao stands) is the private property of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammareh, though it was Turkish territory. West of the Khor Zubair again there is open desert, the going over which is reported to befirm and good. The northern part of the Khor is surrounded partly by a marshy plain much intersected by creeks, and partly by an alluvial plain which is liable to inundation. ’ARABISTAN. Northern ’Arabistan consists of the alluvial plains of the rivers Karun, Diz, and Karkheh. The country is for the most part flat, though a few low ranges of hills exist. Southern ’Arabistan, with the exception of the range of hills through which the Karun forces a passage at Ahwaz, consists of level open plains, mostly barren and thinly sprinkled with desert scrub. Some parts are grassy and cultivated. Near the coast the country is liable to inundation. Bahmanshir River .—From the eastern channel of the Shatt- al-’Arab, the Khor-al-Amaya, the Bahmanshir river is reached. This river forms, with the Shatt-al-’Arab, the island of ’Abbadan, extending to Muhammareh, where the Bahmanshir joins the Karun river. The Khor-al Amaya channel is tortuous and shallow until near the Bahmanshir mouth, but vessels drawing 7 feet can enter the river at low water, the least depth to be passed over being a soft mud bar with 8 feet of water, 10 miles from the mouth. Inside the bar the depths vary from 10 to 15 feet, and at 5 cables from the mouth there is as much as 10 feet. The Bahmanshir river was the original mouth of the Karun, and, following the course of the stream, is about 50 miles in length from the entrance, 10 miles above the bar, to Muhammareh, or 35 miles .in a straight line. It is navigable for vessels drawing not more than 7 feet for about 30 miles from the mouth. Its width near the mouth is 600 to 800 yards, but in the northern half of the river in some places it is only 300 yards across. The banks near the mouth are sloping and of soft mud, covered with coarse grass above high-water mark; a few miles further up the banks are harder and steeper. At about 22 miles from the mouth, villages and date gardens commence, and line the banks almost all the way up to the junction with the Karun. The northern part of the river for about 15 miles is very shallow, some of the mud banks drying almost across the channel at low water; the R.I M. steamer “ Comet,” drawing 3 feet, grounded twice in 1899 in steaming up. S212(W)GSB18 Karim m'er.—The entrance to the Kanin river from the Shatt-al-’Arab is by the Hafar Channel, 45 miles up stream. This channel, for all practical purposes, forms the connecting link between the Karun and the Gulf, for the Bahmanshir, the original mouth {tide page 17), is not generally favourable for navigation. The length of the Hafar Channel is 2 miles, width 400 yards, and depth 18 to 24 feet. From Muhammareh to Ahwaz, a distance of 117 miles, the Karun is navigable for vessels of 2| feet draught from August to November, and for vessels of 4| to 5 feet draught when the river is high. To Ahwaz the width averages 400 yards, the channel being tortuous. The strength of the current varies from 2 to 5 knots according to season. Just below Ahwaz there are rapids for 1J miles ; here cargo is generally transported from steamers to others above the rapids, but Messrs. Lynch’s “ Shushan ” can effect the passage of these rapids. The Karun is the sole navigable river of South Persia, and forms the approach to valuable provinces ; there is some im portance, therefore, to be attached to this river as a trade route. (As a line of advance see page 167.) Muhammareh .—This town is situated in Persian territory, on the north (right) bank of the Hafar Channel, about one mile from the Shatt-al-’Arab and 46 miles from the Persian Gulf by that river. Muhammareh consists of about 800 houses, some of brick and some of mud, and is built on alluvial soil, chiefly along the river bank, where erosion is prevented by revetments of date logs. The town is enclosed above and below by date plantations about J mile deep, and behind the town is an open, treeless desert without any high ground within sight. Both banks of the Karun river are lined with a thick belt of date palms. The Shaikh of Muhammareh’s palace is about 4 miles up the Shatt-al-’Arab just above Failiyeh, and stands on the water’s edge. It is protected in rear by a deep canal. Muhammareh is 4 days by steamer from Karachi. The population of Muhammareh amounts to 23,000, and that of the neighbouring district of Fallahiyeh to 45,000. ’Arabistanis potentially one of the richest provinces of Persia, but the country lacks the population necessary to develop its great agri cultural resources Thousands of acres could be put under cultivation in the neighbourhood of Muhammareh alone. Even ■with the lack of development of natural resources, the trade of Muhammareh is by no means inconsiderable, and has much increased recently owing to the disturbances on the Bushire- Shiraz road. The imports rose from 261,8591!., in 1909, to 916.8101!. in 1910, the bulk of the goods received being material for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which works in the Karun valley. The exports (opium, tobacco and dates) have also increased, but the wheat crop has gone down owing to the failure of the crops in two successive years, this having also happened in the neighbouring valleys of Mesopotamia. Ahwaz is a village of 3,000 inhabitants, standing upon the left bank of the Karun at a point wh^re the bank is high. Behind the village is a desert, and at the north end on an elevated salient of the river is a ruined fort in a strong position. In 1913 a wall round the town was being built. Shushtar stands on elevated ground, between two branches of the Karun river. The citadel is situated on a sandstone cliff overhanging the Shatait, where that river bends due south. It is commanded at short range by part of the town and at longer ranges from the hills on the west bank of the Shatait. Some parts of the town are in ruins, and most of the houses are old. There are only 3 entrances to the town and in each case a bridge or ferry has to be crossed. Dizful is situated on the left bank of the Ab-i-Diz, where the bank falls away towards the river in conglomerate cliffs 100 feet high. The town extends H miles along the river and is f of a mile deep. The houses are closely packed, many two-storied of brick: the streets are narrow and crooked. The outskirts of the town are mostly in ruins. The Governor-General’s palace is situated on the right bank, and consists of a rectangular enclo sure 500' by 300'. incapable of defence. Below Dizful is an ancient bridge of 24 arches. Neither Dizful nor Shushtar has any defences against assault. BASRAH AND VICINITY. Description of town .—The town of Basrah occupies an im portant position as the trade-gate of Mesopotamia and a portion20 of Western Persia, and as the port of transhipment from ocean going steamers, to the river boats and caravans of the interior. It is situated 67 miles from the sea on the right bank of the Shatt- al-’Arab. As a port it has disadvantages under present condi tions, for although navigation up the Shatt-al-’Arab for ocean steamers is fairly easy, there are some shifting shoals and a mud-bar at the mouth limiting the draught of vessels which can ordinarily enter. The tide is felt up to Qurnah, the rise and fall being from 9 to 10 feet, but this is dependent on the strength of the wind and the amount of water in the river. After cross ing the bar ocean steamers anchor oft' Basrah in mid-stream, whence the cargo is discharged into wooden lighters, carrying 15 t© 20 tons. There is not room for two vessels abreast, but any number can lie up and down the river, which is here 600 yards across. The actual town itself lies 2 miles from the river on a narrow creek, the Nahr-al-’Ashar, along which a very fair caniage road runs. It stands in a large area, once enclosed by a mud wall with raised towers at intervals, all of which are now demolished or out of repair. The remains of the wall enclose an irregular rect angle, -1,300 by 2,200 yards, the buildings being at the south west corner, and the rest of the space filled with date gardens. The population, including suburbs, numbers 40,000, mostly composed of sedentary Arabs. There are some Europeans and Indians, about 3,000 Persians and 1,000 Jews. There are several creeks on both banks used for drainage and irrigation. The ’Ashar creek leads up to the town from slightly above the former British Consulate. It is the chief means of communication from the river to the town. Baghlahs can go up at high tide ; at other times only shallow draught boats, and at dead low tide the creek is practically bare mud. Two subsi diary creeks lead from the river to the town, the Khanduq and the Robat. They are both higher upstream than the’Ashar. The latter is crossed by two wmoden bridges, one near its mouth, the other in the town. The Khanduq has one bridge half a mile from the river. The latter creek is used for baghlahs loading grain. Grain stores are to be found along its banks. Width of creeks is about 40 yards. Troops could be landed anywhere on either bank. No special arrangements would be necessary. All the European houses are on the river bank, or a short distance up the ’Ashar creek, while near the mouth of the creek1 21 icean ?rior. liatt- mdi- cean ad a can and igth OSS- am, ing but 300 ow tad ith or ct- th- as. fl 7 id id v )i ad {Q| ,nd iar. ;th, iile ine of on iort eek are the old Turkish dockyard and arsenal, custom-house, Government konak, British Consulate and Turkish Couimo- dore’s house. The only places of importance on the left bank are the ipiarantine station and the naval hospital, with a small landing pier. Beyond is Gardilan, a collection of mud huts. Storehouses .—There are no store depots. Besides sheds, the bottom storeys of the European houses along the river front could be utilized. These houses are two-storied and of brick. There is no stone in the country. Surrounding country and communications .—The country sur rounding Basrah is quite flat everywhere, and any military land ing could easily be covered by the fire of ships stationed in the river. No suitable position offers for the deienee of the town, but the deep muddy canals in the vicinity w r ould greatly impede the movement of troops. From the river to the town there is only the one made road running along the south bank of the ’Ashen creek ; the other tracks are almost impassable in wet wnather. The natural means for further movement north are by the Tigris ; less favourable alternative routes offer by the cara van route along the edge of the desert to Suq-ash-Shuyukh, and Nasiriyah, or by the Euphrates from Suq-ash-Shuyukh or Qurnah. A carriage road leads to Gurmat ’All, but no movement is practicable off this road, and thence north the country is a mass of swamp to ’Amarah. The river routes are fully described in Chapters VI and VIII (seepages 101, 104and 136). As regards the land route to Suq- ash-Shuyukh, this is a good open desert track passable for all arms either via Zubair, (the better route), or direct to Khamisiyah. To reach Khamisiyah would take 7 days via Zubair, 2 days onwards to Nasiriyah. Supplies scarce but water plentiful. (For further details see Route No. 5-B., page 145.) South, several routes lead to Kuwait, that via Zubair, and Umm Qasr being the best [see pages 125 and 129.] North of Basrah, up to and beyond Qurnah, nearly the whole country is marshy, liable to inundation, and quite unsuitable for the movement of troops. There are, however, several tracks through these shallow marshes by which local22 Arabs, on foot and lightly equipped, could find their way down to Basrah, unaccompanied by transport and impedi ments. Zubair .—This town, the site of old Basrah, stands in the desert 9 miles to the south-west of the modern Basrah, and forms the first stage on the route from Basrah to Kuwait or Xajd. Around the town, which is walled, the country is entirely barren except to the south-east, on which side a scattered series of lucerne and melon fields, hedged with tamarisks, extends to a distance of 3 miles ; this tract is called Dirhamiyah, and the drinking water of the town is supplied by its wells, hive miles to the north-west of Zubair is Shaiba, a property belonging to the hereditary Shaikh of Zubair. Shaiba has abundant good water from wells. It has five or six large fortified houses or serais belonging to wealthy people of Zubair who come here in the summer. There is in the town a large covered bazaar, mostly of masonry, and the dwelling-houses are either of sun-dried or of burnt brick, the latter being excavated in great quantities on the adjoining site of ancient Basrah. The population is about 6,000, and virtually all are Sunni Muhammadans, as is natural in a place which holds the tomb of Zuban arch-rebel against Ali, and killed here in fighting against him. Many notables and land-owners of the Basrah neighbour hood have country houses at Zubair, to which they retire in the hot weather in quest of a drier atmosphere, and some important families of Central Arabian origin are also located here. Juss or gypsum mortar is exported from Zubair, and sandals and rude saddlery are manufactured, but the carrying trade pro bably supports a larger number of the population than any other industry. The melons of Dirhamiyah have a high reputation. Zubair is a market town for the surrounding Bedouin tribes. # The ruins of old Basrah extend from the walls of Zubair for 3 miles along the road to the modern Basrah ; they consist of mounds Of earth intermingled with fragments of yellow burnt brick, and they cover an area of several square miles. Two miles from Zubair, on the southern edge of the highroad, are the remains of me of the principal mosques of the ancient town : part of its northern minaret, faced with excellent yellow brick, is still erect. About a mile to the east of this old mosque is the tomb of Talhah,who was slain along with Zubair in the Battle of the Camel, fought near this place in 656 A. D. These two monuments alone remain to testify to the greatness of the former city. THE TIGRIS VALLEY (FROM BAGHDAD TO BASRAH). The river Tigris forms the principal means of approach from Basrah and the Persian Gulf to Baghdad, and, as noted by Sir W. Wilcocks, is the only means of communication north the name between the capital of Mesopotamia and the outer world. Approaching one another to within a distance of 24 miles at Baghdad, the Tigris and the Euphrates then trend apart, finally uniting at Gurmat ’Ali and thence flowing as one stream to Basrah. The country between the rivers is the ancient Babylonian plain, once of great fertility, but now largely lying waste owing to the want of irrigation canals and the proper artificial control of the water which existed in former days. The lower part between the two rivers, prior to their junction, is mostly marsh, with brakes of canes and reeds, while along the lower course of the Kharkeh, a Persian stream which joins near Qurnah, there are also extensive marshes, so that south of ’Amarah traffic is restricted to the river, and any military movement from Basrah to Baghdad would necessarily have to be by steamer or boat, unless a wide detour were made to the west by the Euphrates valley as will be described later. Between the river and the hills on the Persian frontier on the east, the country is flat and termed “ desert ” shortly after the vicinity of the river is left. As a matter of fact, however, although there is no cultivation, this tract is fairly well watered and is to a great extent grass or cultivable land. THE EUPHRATES VALLEY (FROM FALLUJAH TO BAS RAH). The valley of the Euphrates offers somewhat different cha racteristics to that of the Tigris. In the first place the course of the river is by no means clearly defined, and in addition to the old and new channels of the main stream, there are many sub sidiary watercourses and tracts of water which, especially in the time of flood, complicate the question of movement and naviga tion in this region. On this account the river is in present circumstances little used as a means of traffic. On the other hand, it is possible by the Euphrates valley to reach Basrah by24 road. There is a through route, avoiding the main water diffi culties, by Diwaniyah and Samawah to Suq-asii-Shuyukh, and thence to Basrah, the marshy tract which prevents this place being reached by the Tigris valley being skirted by moving along the edge of the desert. Samawah can also be reached in a more roundabout manner, via Karbala and Najaf. The general nature of the Babylonian plain, which oc cupies the space between the two rivers, has already been allud ed to in the last chapter. West of the Euphrates the 'tableland of the Syrian and Arabian deserts approaches to within 30 miles of Najaf and thence continues south within a short distance of the river. This desert tableland is of different formation accord ing to locality, and where it merges into the Mesopotamian low lands it i; by no means an altogether arid waste. Large numbers of nomad tribes circulate over well-defined tracks, and the soil of fine sandy gravel offers a good surface for movement. General nature of the country on the river hanks. —From the Hindiyah barrage to the end of the Shinafiyah Lake there is continuous cultivation on both banks, and the traveller is never out of sight of many date groves. Where the banks are high, wheat and bar! y are grown, and lower down there is an enor mous area of rice cultivation, which is far more profitable than winter crops which are ruined by floods every second or third year. In the direction of Diwaniyah also there w L re large areas under cultivation, but owing to the drying up of Ih 1 llillah branch of the river, many have ceased to exist. The completion (1914) of the new Hindiyah Barrage [q.v. below) will, no doubt, remedy this. It is said that the lands on the Euphrates round about Hillah used to pay a revenue of about £T.57,000 a year, whereas they now pay practically nothing. It seems that the cultivating population has migrated from the now dry Euphrates to the Hindiyah. Between Shina fiyah and Samawah there is not much cultivation. As the banks are high, canals are impossible, and cultivation by lift would be laborious. Further, it is said that during the last fifteen years, this tract has been much distu bed by Arab raiders. From Samawah to Nas.'riyah cultivation is scattered, but taken as a whole fairly extensive ; irrigation is done by water lift, except close to Nasiriyah, where rice cultivation begins. From Nasiriyah to beyond Suq-r.sh-Shuyukh is a long succes sion of gardens and cultivation, and the country appears incom-incomparably richer than anything seen elsewhere in Mesopo tamia. In several places Sir William Willcocks has compared it with the very best parts of Egypt. Prom Suq-ash-Shuyukh to Qurnah there are extensive date plantations, and their area can be almost indefinitely increased if the swamps are reclaimed, which will not be difficult to do if Sir William’s schemes are carried out. As regards through-traffic, many caravans come from Central Arabia to Suq-ash-Shuyukh, Nasiriyah and Najaf, and there ought to be a large trade in skins and wool, in addition to the local trade in dates, rice and cereals. If the people could conveni ently export their produce, there would no doubt be a corres ponding increase in the import trade. Hindiyah Barrage .—The Hindiyah Barrage is the only work, of those projected by Sir W. Willcocks, which has actually been taken in hand and completed by the Turkish Government. It is situated a short distance below Musaiyib, at the point where the Euphrates divides into two branches, one flowing past Hillah, the other, the Hindiyah Branch, towards Najaf. Owing to various causes the former commenced to silt up about 45 years ago and though an attempt was made 20 years after to reme dy this by the construction of a barrage in the form of a weir across the Hindiyah Branch, the situation became more and more serious, as the fertile areas below Hillah and in the direc tion of Diwaniyah were gradually drying up. By 1910, Hillah itself was in a parlous state, water only reaching it during floods. In that year the repair of the old barrage and construction of a new barrage was begun by Sir W. Willcocks, who later handed the work over to Sir J. Jackson and Company, by whom, in spite of many troubles, political and physical, it was completed in 1914. The new barrage is provided with gates so that the height of water held up can be controlled, and the Hillah Branch has a regulat ing head. Two locks to take large country boats were constructed in conjunction with the barrages. The dimensions proposed were 55x8 yards. This work should restore the lands, of which mention has been made, to their old position of prosperity, and increase the area under cultivation. It will ensure a perennial flow of water along the Husainiyah Canal to Karbala. S212(W)GSB26 TOWNS ON THE TIGRIS. {See also route reports page 123 et seq.) Qurnah.~A town of 5,000 inhabitants on the right bank of the Tigris, and situated at the junction of that river with the former channel of the Euphrates. The date plantations, commencing at Basrah, continue for 4 miles to the north of Qumah where there then begin the great marshes of the Tigris and Euphrates, extend ing between those two rivers, and the marshes to the east formed by the overflow of the Karkheh and other streams. The two lines of telegraph, leading from Baghdad by the Euphrates and Tigris respectively, unite at Qurnah. There is a telegraph office open at Qurnah connected by a line to Basrah. Shatrat-al 'Amamh.— (Qal’at Salih) 500 houses and occasional stopping place for steamers. Telegraph office. '‘Amarah .—A place of 10,000 inhabitants also on the left bank of the river, and with a considerable grain traffic. Bridge, barracks and telegraph office similar to Kut. There is here, however, also a fine river frontage, 500 or 600 yards in length, at which steamers tie up. Caravan routes lead to Kut, and Dizful in Persia. The Christian sect of Sabians have their principal location at ’ Amarah. The two towns, Kut-al-Amarah and ’Amarah are the principal places between Baghdad and Basrah Kut-al-Amarah. —4,000 inhabitants and the centre of a con siderable grain traffic, most of which comes from the Shatt-al- Hai (more usually known &amp;s Shatt-al-Gharafy the canal or channel which runs across from the Tigris at Kut to the Euphrates. 500 houses, with telegraph office and barracks for 200 men all on the left bank of the river, with a bridge of boats across. Caravan routes lead to Baghdad and Mandali ; from Badrah on the latter route, a difficult hill track crosses over to Kirmanshah in Persia. Shatrat-al-Muntafik is a small town on the Shatt-ai Bai, and is on the boundary of the Basrah and Baghdad wilayeis In the neighbourhood lives Shaikh Bargash of the Muntafik tnbe. The Shatt-al-*Hai is dry in the low water season, water the being obtained from springs in the river bed. Some further details regarding these towns will be found in Route (river) Report No. 4. {See page 136.)TOWNS ON OR NEAR THE EUPHRATES. (See also Route reports, page 123 et seq.) Ourmat 'Ali .—A large village built on high ground in the marshes, connected with the Tigris by a large water-channel and with Basrah by a carriage road through marshes and date groves. The country on either side of this road is not passable for troops. To the north-west are reed-covered swamps with many island villages standing like towers out of the water. To the west is the khor or open water. Suq-ash-Shuyiikh .—An important town situated for the most part on the right bank of the Euphrates ; it derives its name from the fact that the desert tribes resort to it for trade. The town has numerous fruit gardens, and its date plantations extend up the left bank of the Euphrates till they meet those of Nasiriyah ; the neighbourhood, unfortunately, is marshy and the climate unhealthy. The Euphrates is spanned at the town by a bridge of about 12 pontoons, the number of which is increased to 15 or 16 when the river rises. The population of Suq-ash-Shuyukh amounts to about 12,000 souls, about three-fourths of whom are Shi’ahs; but it includes 700 Sabians and 300 Jews. The religious head of the Sabians lives here ; the community, who have a small primary school for their children, are mostly goldsmiths, blacksmiths and builders of Mashhuf canoes; they inhabit a quarter on the left bank of the river which is connected with the main town by the bridge of boats. There are over 200 shops at Suq-ash-Shuyukh, but, except with the Arab tribes, there is no considerable trade. Suq-ash-Shuyukh is the head-quarters of a qadha of the same name in the sanjaq of Muntafik, and it is connected by a single hue of telegraph with the town of Nasiriyah above, and with Qurnah, but not direct with Basrah. There are post and customs offices, while the affairs of the river are controlled by a harbour-master. Aastnt/a&amp;.-^-Nasiriyah is a comparatively modem town of some 10,000 inhabitants, founded on tire left bank of the Euphrates, about 19 miles from Suq-ash-Shuyukh, by Nasir Pasha, chief of the Muntafik Arabs, to perpetuate his residence. It usually had a garrison of one or more Nizam battalions, and was the place of assembly for the various expeditions designed from time to time to overawe the Muntafik (see page 59).28 ^wawaA.—Samawah stands principally on the right bank of e Euphrates, and is built of materials obtained from some ancient ruins close by. There is a boat bridge. It has a good bazaar, and is a special centre for the corn trade of the adjoining districts of the Euphrates. To the south the river bank is lined with extensive date gardens* There is a ferry a short way down stream at A1 Khidhar. Rumaithah. Rumaithah is a town of about 2,500 inhabit ants, who are all Shrahs. There is a bazaar of some 180 shops but many are now deserted. The houses, in number about 600,* mostly low mud huts, are scattered among gardens and planta tions. It was formerly a place of considerable prosperity, but owing to the drying up of the branch of the Euphrates on which it stands it is now half deserted. After the date harvest a good deal of business is still transacted here with the Arabs of the neighbourhood. The opening of the new Hindiyah Barrage {see page 25) may favourably affect this place. Diwaniyah is situated on the Hillah branch of the Euphrates which, before the completion of the new Hindiyah Barrage (see page 25) in 1913, had dried up. The population (in 1908) numbered less than 4,000, mostly Shi’ahs, and was decreasing. The houses are mostly of sundried brick. The town depends for supplies on outlying places, and water is obtained from wells. The trade is practically nil. It is the headquarters of the Diwani yah Sanjaq, and its central position in the district is its only recommendation as such. The nominal garrison was 1 bat talion and 3 guns, but seldom more than 80 men were present. The town is connected with Hillah by a double, and Samawah by a single line of telegraph. Formerly there was a bridge of boats across the river. . Hittah. Hillah is the chief town of &amp;qadha of the same name in the sanjaq of Diwaniyah. The population, three-fourths of whom are Shi’ah Arabs, number 30,000. Surrounded by gar dens and fruit trees, Hillah is the centre of a district which pro duces wheat and barley in abundance, though in 1908 its agri cultural prosperity was on the decline owing to the drying up of the branch of the Euphrates on which it stands. This may have been stayed by the opening iff the new Hindiyah Barrage at the junction of the two branches of the river near Musaiyib! There were (in 1908) some 2,000 shops and 120 grain stores, andconsiderable trade was carried on. It is calculated that undef favourable conditions the following supplies could be collected in a week ; 400 tons of wheat; 600 tons of barley ; 100 tons of rice ; 1,000 oxen and cows ; 600 buffaloes ; 300 horses ; 100 don keys, 50 mules ; 700 camels, and 5,000 sheep. There is a post office and telegraph office. The military garrison consisted of 1 regiment of cavalry, 1 battalion of infantry, and 3 guns. There was said to be a large stock of ammunition, equipment for a bat talion of reservists, and a reserve battery of field guns. Musaiyib. —Musaiyib is an important place on the Baghdad- Karbala road ; it contains 1,000 houses, and the permanent in habitants number some 3,500, with a floating pilgrim popu lation of 1,500 more, mostly Shi’ah Arabs and Persians. The larger part of the town, including a covered bazaar, is on the left bank. There is a bridge of boats (24 in number), 185 yards long, crossing the Euphrates (see also page 158'. Trans port is not readily obtainable ; there are 100 shops and 25 grain stores ; there are 40,000 date trees, and the place is the centre of a good agricultural district. Najnf (Mashhad ’Ah ).—Najaf is a place of 12,000 inhabitants, including a number of Indian Moslems ; it contains the shrine of ’Ali, and is a spot of great sanctity among Shi’ah Moslems, some 6,000 corpses being brought here every year for interment. It is about 30 miles from Hillah, and is situated on an ele vated ridge of sandstone 150 feet above the plain. It is surround ed by walls 25 feet high and 5 to 6 feet thick, of burnt brick, with no ditch ; these are nearly square in circuit, and strengthen ed at intervals by bastions, the houses inside being closely packed. Water is scarce ; wells brackish ; best drinking water in skins from Hindiyah canal, 4 miles off. The town is dependent on the Bani Hassan and Muntafik Arabs for supplies. There was formerly a regular garrison of one battalion. Supplies abundant from Baghdad to Najaf. Over 2,000 pil grims a day pass over this route in pilgrim season, lasting about 4 months, and never have any difficulty about supplies. The country which is most fertile, with much corn, and immense flocks of sheep, would support an army corps, on march or halted, tor some time, if the inhabitants were friendly.

On the west bank is the old tZ e n odwZ 7bZ7 Ve 7 aCt ° f 0ran § e and dat e groves, ’ffilie walls of brick have been demolished, except in a few places,notably in the south-west corner, but the ditch still remains; now dry for the most part, and enclosing a circumference of about 6 miles. The remains of the old covered way and glacis form a line of mounds, giving a command of 10 to 15 feet over the plain. There are two gates still remaining, the south-east gate, (Bab-ash-Sharqi) on the right bank, the north-west gate (Bab-al-Mu’adhdham) on the left bank. The citadel near the north-west gate still exists but its walls are also falling into decay. The town has no architectural character whatever and even in the modern portion the streets are mere alleys crowded with bazaars, which are arched in with brick. The late Wali, Nazim Pasha, among other measures took in hand the question of street improvement, but his acts were not characterized by prudence, and he caused great resentment by the various demoli tions which were carried out by his order. The shops are well supplied with European articles, including Manchester cotton goods and English stores. The Sarai (residence of the Wali), a good building, is situat ed on the river bank north of the citadel ; near, and also on the left bank, above the bridge, are the infantry barracks, an imposing two-storied brick braiding, on three sides of a square, able to contain 3,000 men. The artillery and cavalry barracks and stables are in the citadel and outside the north-west gate. In addition to the regular barracks, a standing camp of mud built huts has recently been established outside the town about 1 mile from the south-east gate. There was a large European colony, chiefly British, who lived in good houses on the left bank of the river near the British Residency. A fine hospital, built by a wealthy Jewish merchant, has lately (1911) been opened outside the north gate, while there are French Carmelite schools, a Jewish high school and a branch of the Church Missionary Society. The representative of the British Government in Baghdad had for long occupied a privileged posh ion in comparison with the status of the representatives of other foreign powers. These latter fulfilled the ordinary functions of consuls, but the British representative was styled Resident (he is referred to by Arabs32 as “Saflr’’--ambassador) and had a guard of 30 Indian In fantry, with a gunboat of the Royal Indian Marine (R.I.M.S. Comet ’ ’), stationed on the river. Communication across the river is at present maintained by a bridge of boats consisting of 22 pontoons, made of wooden planking, coated with bitumen. The 1 breadth of the roadway is 30 feet. On the pontoons near each end of thebri !ge facing south are cafes, and in the centre two rooms for the watch- men of the bridge. This bridge was constructed in September 1902, and is in good repair, but the steep ascent and descent at each end make it difficult for horses, and almost impassable at low water for wheeled vehicles heavily laden. The bridge is 221 yards long and 16 of the pontoons are about 42 feet long but three pairs in the centre and near the ends are 52 feet long. The breadth of the pontoons is about 18 feet. In high floods or strong wind the bridge has to be swuno- back. The approaches on either bank are through narrow^ winding streets. The current in April is about 4 miles an hour’ the average width of the stream being 250 yards, and in flood it is 30 to 36 feet deep. To allow boats to pass, six pontoons next the right bank, can be swung back. In conjunction with other improvements due to the initiative of the late Nazim Pasha, tenders have been invited for the con struction of an iron bridge, 240 yards long and 40 feet broad with a swinging portion of 33 yards for the passage of steamers! In addition to the steam boats plying on the river which will be alluded to in Chapter VI, 100 large sailing-boats are available at Baghdad, carrying from 20 to 100 tons each and 200 wicker corafles carrying 1 ton or ten men. A British firm in 1911 supplied three 12-knot motor- vessels to work as ferry boats on the Tigris at Baghdad. Country immediately around Baghdad.—The country generally around Baghdad is quite flat with desert both east and west This desert, however, in many places is covered with pasturage in sprmg or after any fall of rain and there are some immense tracts which only require irrigation to become fruitful. Immediatelv in the neighbourhood of the river there is cultivation and on the right bank gardens and cultivated tract* extend for some waySouth of Baghdad towards Mahmudiyah; movement off thd raised embankment, on which the road runs, would be difficult after rain or if the river were high. East towards Fallujah, the desert is in parts sandy clay and in parts pebbly, covered at first with camel-thorn and then with scanty shrubs. West, the country is an open sandy desert, uncultivated but cultivable; inthe vafiey of the Diyalah towards Ba’qubahmove ment would be difficult for troops on account of the numerous water-cuts. No positions for attack or defence of the city offer except on the south side, where on the right bank of the river, at 3 miles from the south gate, a line of low earth hills form a’fairly good position facing south and extending for 2 miles, with the left bank resting within J mile of the riven The suburbs, the gardens and date groves could be connected by earthworks with the hills and a regular line of defence formed on the right bank, bu' the left bank has no natural advantages for either attack or defence. Approach from the south by the Mahmudiyah road could be met by a defence of the bridge over the Khirr stream, 3 miles south of Baghdad. The locality here offers a suitable site for the construction of a bridgehead covered by the occupation of the wood in rear. NOBTH-WESTERN SHORES OF PERSIAN GULF (FAO TO KUWAIT). Proceeding south-west from the entrance to the Shatt-al-’Arab* 1 there are two main inlets or indentations in the coast line, (i) the approach to Umm Qasr, and (it) the Bay of Kuwait. (i) Approach to Umm Qasr. This place lies at the head of a rectangular opening of the coast line, the space so formed being occupied by Bubiyan island, with the Khor Abdullah and Khor Sabiyah inlets leading round this island to Umm Qasr. Just in front of Umm Qasr is the smaller island of Warbah. The Khor 'Abdallah is 13 miles wide at its entrance by RaS-al- Qaid, miles long up to Warbah island and 8 miles further on to Umm Qasr. S212(w)GSBThe channel to follow to roach Umm Qasr lios north of Warbah island,' between this and the mainland. Great care is necessary to avoid a sandbank extending eastward from Warbah island, but therb' appears to be nowhere loss than 24 feet of water available for navigation, and it is considered that the shallow part off Warbah island could be dredged if necessary. Anchorage may be taken up anywhere in the channel, but there is a well-sheltered and deep anchorage between Warbah and the mainland as Umm Qasr is approached. Both shores of the Khor ’Abdullah are of a very low alluvial land, covered in places with reeds and grass and with shallow flats extending a long way out on both sides, more particularly from the northern shore, Bnbiyan island is 25 miles long by 12 broad, but it has no permanent population, and apparently no natural water-supply. It belongs to the Shaikh of Kuwait, but in 1902 a small Turkish pi&gt;st was established on the narrow Bas-al-Qaid peninsula. A’ small brick barrack was constructed, but all supplies, including water, had to be brought by dhow from Fao. The post has since been removed. The KAor Sabiyah, which separates Bubiyan from the western mainland, is about 1,000 yards wide, but is shallow, and not suitable as a means of approach to Umm Qasr. Warbah island is about 8 miles long by 2 broad; it is flat and sandy, and about 10 feet above high water-level. At the south west end of the island there are great natural advantages for the establishment of a port. It will be recollected that the channel to Umm Qasr runs along the eastern point of Warbah island, and that Umm Qasr cannot be reached by the Khor Sabiyah and Khor Salaa along the western end, but if one proceeds up the Khor ’Abdullah and then turns off along the south of Warbah island, the bank or bar in the northern channel, which has to be crossed to reach Umm Qasr, is avoided and a deep channel is reached extending to the south-west corner of Warbah. This is rather narrow, but has good anchorage for the largest ships and is quite landlocked. If the channel were dredged, a very fine harbour indeed might be made. Umm Qasr is the name of a small creek at the head of the Khor ’Abdullah and on the banks of which the Turks constructed a small fort. North of Warbah island, the Khor ’Abdullah and Khor Sabiyah unite, forming the Khor Zubair, from which theUmm Qasr creek branches of? to the west about 4 miles above the junction. The Khor Zubair is about f mile wide and contains depp water opposite Umm Qasr and for 14 miles inland. At this point, it divides into two branches, one running north-eastwards, with a depth of 18 feet, to within 12 miles of the Shatt-al-’Arab, theother much shallower and narrower, going further west to within 10 miles of Basrah and Zubair. Although, however, the depths of the channel in the Khor Zubair are generally good, the navigation is not altogether easy. For anchorage and landing see page 109. The Umm Qasr creel* itself is about 3 miles&gt; long and i mile broad, with a depth of water generally of only 3 to 4 feet;. The fort is situated about \ mile inland, but the usual landing place is at the entrance of the creek. The building is nearly square, measuring about 120 feet each way, and having one entrance in the north face ; a recently constructed salient on the west side enfilades two fac^s. The walls are 15 feet high, loopholed at,4£ feet from the ground, and are built chiefly of mud ; the gateway and coping of the walls are of burnt brick. There are wells with a plentiful supply of w ater to the northward opposite the entrance to the fort at 250 yards distance, and the water used by the garrison is sweet; whether it is obtained from these wells, or elsewhere, is uncertain. No supplies are obtainable at Umm Qasr, and not even vegetables are grown ; there is grazing fpr sheep, but not for horses. The ground in the neighbourhpod is firm and gravelly. Umm Qasr is said to be more healthy than Basrah pit is 15 miles from Safwan and 34 from Basrah ; there are wells on the direct route from Zubair to Umm-Qasr, but travellers between Basrah and Umm Qasr ordinarily pass through Zubair and Safwan. For details of routes via Zubair and Safwan see Chapter YIII, Routes Nos. 1 and 2, page 125 et seq. The country to the north and east of the v Khpr Zubair^ is marshy for several miles. Safwan, on slightly rising ground, has wells of passable water 12 feet deep. There are a few houses and a date grove surround ed by a wall. Jabal Sanam, an isolated volcanic hill, stands 5 miles to the west.36 XJmm Qasr and Safwan constituted the southern limit of Turkish occupation as distinguished from the territory under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Kuwait, The political relations between the Shaikh and the Ottoman Government are mentioned in Chapter I. (ii) Kuwait Bay and Territory. Following the coast line of the Khor Sabiyah round to Kuwait Bay or harbour, there is only one spot which calls for further notice, i.e., Sabiyah (the Khor Sabiyah has been alluded to on page 34). Sabiyah is a fortified mud enclosure belonging to the Shaikh of Kuwait; it is situated on the east bank of the Khor about 3 miles from the tip of the promontory that divides the mouth of the Khor Sabyah from Kuwait Bay. The enceinte of the fort is about 100 yards long by 80 yards broad, and at high tide the sea approaches it very closely ; in spite, however, of a rather steeplv shelvmg bank, landing is difficult on account of mud, in all states ot the tide. The garrison consists of about a dozen retainers of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The supply of water, from wells outside the enceinte, is brackish; there is a plantation of about 300 young date trees. Sabiyah formerly boasted some cultivation, which it owed to Yusuf-bin-Ibrahim, the enemy (now deceased) of the present Shaikh of Kuwait; but the place was ruined in hostilities between Shaikh Mubarak and some of his nephews about 1899. babiyah is surrounded by some tamarisks, which, in approach ing the place from the west, first become visible at a distance of about 5 miles. . Exte nt of Kuwait territory.—The boundaries of the Kuwait principality are for the most part fluctuating and undefined; they are, at any given time, the limits of the tribes which then, either voluntarily or under compulsion, owe allegiance to the Shaikh of Kuwait. The northern and southern frontiers in the neighbour- the sea may ’ however, be regarded as fixed; on those Bides the question is not between the Shaikh and nomadic Arab tribes, but between the Shaikh and the Turkish Government. Un the north the most advanced Turkish outposts upon the main Umm Q asr and Taiwan, and the influence of the Snaikn of Kuwait was unquestioned up to the very walls of those places ; we may accordingly consider the frontier on this side to Jmt W r T U T Dmn , g 1 fr0m the Khor Sabiyah so as to pass immediately mm Qasr and Safwan to Jabal Sanam and thence to theBatin. On the south the Turks had no station nearer to Kuwait town than Musallamiyah Island ; the Shaikh’s boundary on the south may be considered to run westwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to Nta’ and onwards to Wabrah. It is a task of great difficulty to circumscribe the Shaikh’s territories on the remaining sides with even approximate accuracy. Shaikh Mubarak stated (1904) that on the north-west his influence reaches to the Batin and somewhat beyond it, and that on the west the inhabitants of Summan, but not those of Dahana, acknowledge him; and his assertion is to some extent borne out by known facts in regard to the occupation of Hafar, which Ibn Rashid, though at one time he seized it, was unable for long to retain. We may therefore consider that the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and that south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahana as far south as the point where that line is inter sected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. These being the limits of the Kuwait Principality its length from N.-N.-W. to S.-S.-E. is about 190 miles, and its breadth from E.-N.-E. to W. S. W. about 160 miles. The maritime possessions of Kuwait consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warbah and of Failakah, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashj an and ’Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Kuwait Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al-Maradim. Kuwait Harbour .—A remarkably fine bay some 20 miles long and 10 miles wide, stretching approximately'east and west, forms an excellent and flourishing harbour. The surrounding country to the southward is low-lying, level, and of the ordinary desert type, stretching away as far as the eye can see. The Hill Fort” shown on the charts, sonje 1\ miles south-east of the town of Kuwait, stands 180 feet above sea level, and is a con spicuous object when entering the bay from the sea. It is a well-built square erection, with towers at the corners. There is a small village to the south-east of this fort on the coast, nestling among palms and other trees. For anchorage and landing see page 110. With the exception of some sand-hills immediately to the south of the town, which are referred to in greater detail further on, the general character of the country along the southern■BBBSHBHBEBH 38 ♦ shore of the bay Is the same, /.&lt;?., an unbroken level plain of fairly firm whitish sand stretching away to the south and south-west. After reaching its most westerly point in Dohat Kadhamah, near the head of which lies the village of Jahrah, the coast-line makes an abrupt turn to the north east. Along this northern side of the bay, about 2 miles from the water’s edge, there runs a line of heights, steep and cliil-like on their sea face, having an elevation of about 200 feet. These give valuable shelter from the prevailing and most important wind, the sharnal, which blows from the north-west. Owing to this shelter no sea at all distressing to big ships is raised in the bay, even by a strong north-west gale. The general direction of the coast-line then trends eastwards until it reaches the Khor Sabiyah, which separates the swampy island of Bubiyan from the mainland. Along this shore a mud flat extends some distance from the beach, and increases in width to the eastward until it is nearly 5 miles in breadth opposite to Ras-al-Ardh. Failakah Island, at the entrance to the bay, is about 7 miles long by 3 miles wide at its western end. It is all very low- lying, its highest point being only 30 feet above sea level. There is only one village, Zor, on the north-west coast. The inhabitants of the island number some 500 souls. The island is unhealthy, and the water indifferent. Kuwait Town .—The town of Kuwait lies on a small projec tion, or tongue of land (which terminates in Ras-al-’Ajuzah), on the southern shore of the great bay to which it givers its name. The town extends about a mile along the beach ; it is provided with numerous substantial stone breakwaters, w'hich form tidal harbours for native craft. The beach dries out to a consider able distance, and landing when the tide is out is by no means a pleasant operation ; ponies are taken out and are mounted from the boat, or fai ling this it would be necessary to w'ade for a considerable distar ce. At high water, however, the sea washes up to the front row of houses and landing from boats, or any of the sea-walls, is an easy matter. It is a remarkably clean, well-built and prosperous looking town,, wdth many solid stone houses, others beinS built of sun-dried brick. The bazaar is broad and open, clean and busy. The town is sur rounded by a low wall with towers, which, however, are not in a good condition for defence.39 ^ Outside the main gate, on the southern, or land, face, there is a large suburb of mud huts, which is the point of arrival and departure for the caravans trading between Kuwait and the interior. Here may be seen strings of camels, waiting for their loads or having just got rid of them. Here, too, the Bedouins mostly congregate, as, if armed, they are not_ allowed to enter the town itself, camp and transact their business. The popu lation is estimated at approximately 35,000 souls, of whom some 50 are said to be Jews from Bushire, with a synagogue or their own. The town is said to contain about 3,000 houses, 500 shops, 3 caravansarais, six coffee houses, three schools and four mosques, as well as numerous warehouses and stores. There are no statistics or definete date available, but the growth and nrosoeritv of the place may, perhaps, be inferred from the fact P about 30 new houses are said to be built, and 40 new shops opened, every year. Population. —The following detailed estimate of P 0 ^ 1 ?' tion of Kuwait territory was furnished by Shaikh Mubarak in 1901 :— Fighting men in Kuwait .. •- 19,000 Old men and children • • 13,000 22,000 — 54,000 Women Fighting men in the district (within 10 miles of Kuwait).. Old men and children Women Total 12,000 9,000 14,000 35.000 89.000 ttat at the time this estimate was J ™ i8 ^ d - an th “ C^out- persons in the town had been increased by an mtiox40 lying tribes taking refuge in Kuwait, at the approach of Ibn Rashid; in this case, perhaps, the exaggeration may not be quite as great as it would appear at first sight. If the apparent over- estimate of “ fighting men ” be reduced to the number# men tioned in another estimate, also furnished by the Shaikh, viz. t to between 6,000 and 7,000 men, with a roughly proportionate deduction from the numbers of women and children, the total number of inhabitants would seem to work out to between 30,000 and 40,000, the former of which is the number usually considered to be approximately correct. The population is Muhammadan, Arab fashion, that is, tolerant to others and not over-rigid to themselves. The Wahabi faith is proscribed, and all the efforts of Najd have never succeed ed in making one single proselyte at Kuwait. Resources. Nothing grows near Kuwait, Save grass and vegetation for camel-grazing ; the agricultural resources may, therefore, be considered nil except at Jahrah, {q. v . page 42)! During the winter months there is some sparse grazing, enough for the needs of the Bedouins’ herds of frugal goats, eyen on the apparently arid plain round the town of Kuwait; but the best grazing grounds, much frequented by Bedouins, are those around Jahrah, Kadhamah Bay, and thence along the northern shore, between the Zor hills and the water’s edge. No sign of cultivation call be seen on the higher ground north and north west of these heights. The wealth of the place proceeds from its trade, shipping, shipbuilding, fishing, pearl fishing, and, to a small extent, cattle-breeding. Some 500 boats, with crews averaging from 15 to 40 men each, are engaged in pearl fishing. The size of these boats varies from 30 to 300 tons burden, while some of as much as 1,000 tons are engaged in trade with India and Mesopotamia. The sea-going cargo boats number between 30 and 40. There are about 300 carpenters, who gain a livelihood by boat building; all the material is imported from India. Fishing is evidently a considerable industry ; the fish weirs on the flat beach between Kuwait and the open sea are a very conspicuous object. Besides the fish most commonly met with in Eastern waters, excellent soles are to be had, which would be, no doubt, a feature in the “ menu ” of the hotels, should this harbour ever become the ocean terminus for any railway such a that now contemplated.Administration .-—The Government is patriarchal, even as the Shaikh himself is the living presentment of one’s idea of the biblical patriarchs. A big dinner is prepared every day for any wanderers and strangers who may wish to share it; the one and only restriction is that arms must be left at the gate. The Shaikh exercises political and the qadhi judicial functions. Punishment is rarely inflicted, and there seems to be but little governmental interference with the liberty of the subject in any respect, and to be little need for it. No tribute is, or ever has been, paid either to the Amir of Najd or to the Turkish Government. Nor is tribute exacted from other tribes. The Shaikh has a Customs Department, but no statistic s are available. Thus under a succession of common-sense rulers with a policy wisely originated and systematically pursued, an Arab band of pirates now appear as the masters of a thriving free-trade port. In December 1914, the Shaikh of Kuwait adopted a special flag of his own. Currency .—The currency is cosmopolitan. As elsewhere in Arabia the Maria Theresa dollar, “ real ” (the value of which is about 1 rupee 8 annas) may be considered the standard medium of exchange ; while Persian krans and Turkish copper coins are also met with. English sovereigns are occasionally to be found, and the Indian rupee is not despised. Bills can be obtained on Basrah, Bushire and Bombay, and also, it is said, on the capital of Najd. Water- supply .—-Water is obtained from the following sources:— (*) Scattered wells south-west of the town, and 4,000 to 5,000 yards E.-N.-E. of Bandar Shuwaikh. Most of the water for the town is got from these wells. (»») Wells with abundance of water about 3 miles S.-S.-E. of Kuwait. (Hi) Wells at Ras-al-'Ajuzah, east of the town. (iv) Wells at Jahrah. The water is reported to be of indifferent quality. Water is also obtained from the Shaft-ah*Arab, and a tanh steamer has recently been acquired by the Shaikh for this pur pose. S212(w)GSB |'» 42 Climate.—The climate is distinctly good as compared with that of many ports in the Persian Gulf. In December and January it is perfect, and can only be compared with that of Egypt—fine and ■bracing in the mornings and evenings, and never unpleasantly hot. Even during the ho]b months of the year, the prevailing wind, from the north-west, which blows from the desert, is some what tempered by crossing 10 miles of the waters of the bay, while, on the other hand, it has not absorbed enough moisture to have that muggy, steamy and relaxing character with which it reaches Bushire. Though the drinking water is brackish, fever is practically unknown, and dysentery and ophthalmia are rare. In short, as has been rather quaintly remarked, “ where men commence begetting new families at SO and die at 120, the climate cannot be considered as prematurely exhausting. ” Trade .—The resources of Kuwait are entirely commercial. Its geographical position as the only seaport for the Jabal Shammar district of Central Arabia, as well as its mercantile aspect, has in this respect been compared with Trieste’s some what similar position with regard to Austria. Palgrave remarks on this similarity, and considered it to conduce to a continuance of the good relations existing in his day {IS62—63) between the Shaikhs of Kuwait and those of Hail. This, however, has not been the case since Shaikh Mubarak’s acces sion . The loss of trade due to the disturbed state of things which has obtained of late years must have been considerable, and the anxiety of Ibn Rashid (Shaikh or Amir of Hail) to possess himself of Kuwait, or at the least to set up a Shaikh there friendly and subordinate to himself is easily understood. The natural ad vantages of this seaport as a mart are evident and lasting. Imports are chiefly cereals, piece-goods, tobacco, dates, coffee, sugar : exports tobacco, wheat, pearls, dates and ghi. Jahrah .—A village which lies some 15 miles w'est of Kuwait, at the western extremity of the bay, about 1,200 yards inland from high water mark. It is well built of sun-dried bricks and has a circumference of about a mile and a half. There are out-lying patches of cultivation round the walls, and many enclosures con taining wheat, date trees, lucerne, tamarisk, etc., surrounded by mud wallsj from 2 to 3 feet thick, and 8 or 10 feet high ; most of these contain their own wells, the water of which is, as a rule, good for irrigation purposes only. The population may be esti mated at about 500 souls.There is an old fort (in disrepair) on the western frontage of the village, as well as a new one, built by the present Shaikh, clear of the south-eastern end of the village. CLIMATE. The climate of Mesopotamia may be classed as tropical# with an excessively hot summer, during which the plains become scorched and bare. The winters are short and mild, forming the pleasantest part of the year. Corn is sown about November and December and harvest ed in May or June. An autumn crop of maize, harvested about December, is often raised as well. The climates of Kuwait, Fao, Basrah, and Muhammareh are very similar. Kuwait appears to be the coolest, owing to the proximity of the sea and the sandy deserts. Basrah, occasionally has frost at night in January. The average heat in summer is 108 degrees in the shade r extreme, 118 degrees. It is cold in winter but there is seldom any frost. The coldest time is in January. The rainy season - is from December to February. Tire prevailing wind is from the north-west, called “ shamal,’ 2 which blows for a month a&amp; a.time in. the hot. weather and is somewhat of a relief. The following table gives an average range of temperatures taken at; Fao):— Season. Months. Approximate ■&gt; range of temperature., Winter December to February, both in clusive. 85° to 45* Spring March to May, both inclusive .. 108° to 65° - Summer June to September, both inclu sive. 102° to 70° Autumn October and November both in clusive. 105° to 75°44 Rains. —Rafns may fall between the middle of November and the middle of March. Total appears to vary from 3}/ to ]}/ at Fao j at Basrah it is about 6'. There are occasional showers at all seasons. The westest months are December, January and February. *&gt;- Winds .—During the first half of March and during July north-west winds prevail with dry heat. From about the middle of July to the end of September the atmosphere is damp as well as hot i there is little wind from September to January. South winds may be expected in December to April, north and north-west from April to September. In September and October there are frequently fogs at night and in the early morning; especially near Fao. Health .—Malarial fever in the autumn is the principal disease of the country. Epidemics of cholera and plague occur. Other diseases in the towns are small-pox, diphtheria, typhoid, tubercu losis, and syphilis. The Baghdad boil is said to be practically unknown in ’Iraq outside Baghdad itself. This is a disease known variously as the “ Aleppo button 11 or ‘‘ Baghdad date- mark “ ; it is seldom absent from the towns fringing the desert. This affection, probably caused by the bite of a fly, though troublesome, is never fatal, usually lasting about a twelve- month. t 'Basrah is said to be less unhealthy than it used to be } but it is malarious most of the year. The winter is the most suitable time for military operations any time between October and March. For climate of Kuwait see page 42. *Ardbistan. —Rain may fall at any time between October and the middle of May ; it is commonest in December. From the beginning of October to the end of March the climate is good. During January the thermometer falls as low as 40° at Muhammareh, and in Northern ‘Arabistan it some times reaches freezing point (32°). The heat during June, July, and August makes military operations during these months almost impossible. During the hot weather, especially in autumn, malaria is prevalent at Muhammareh, but no doubt much of the sickness is due to the insanitary condition of the town. This is the case also atShush tar. In July the thermometer sometimes reaches 110*, and at Shushtar occasionally even 120'. The nights in the neighbourhood of the Karun are generally cool. In 1857 the troops suffered much at Muhammareh from my riads of flies by day, and from sand flies by night; but the heat was found to be less than at Bushire. All routes in Southern ’Arabistan are almost impassable after rain, and in dry weather they are very trying owing to the sand and dust. Both Dizful and Shushtar are too hot to allow of life under canvas being either healthy or pleasant during the hot weather. Yet the finding of a suitable hill station is difficult. The nearer hills appear to have no water at the necessary elevation, while the distance to any place of the required elevation is almost prohibitive. From Dizful, Khurramabad, 4,050', is about 100 to 150 miles according to the route taken. Two places called Pahreh, 4,250 , and Challan, 4,280% where tribes camp, are only 40 and 53 miles respectively, Baznui, 5,000% is 100 miles, and would be suitable from a climatic point of view. From Shushtar, Qal’eh Bazuft, 5,300% is 110 miles. Along the Bakhtiari road, Malamir, at 80 miles, is only 2,950' and Dih Diz at 113 miles is 5,200% and yet it is deserted by its inhabit ants in summer.CHAPTER III. POPULATION. Inhabitants .—The bulk of the inhabitants consists of Arabs* either nomad Bedouins or, in the case of the populations of the towns and villages, sedentary Arabs ; of the nomad tribes, the principal are the Muntafik, under Ajaimi bin Sa’adun Pasha, who lives at Suq-ash-Shuyukh, and the Bani Lam,, on the left bank of the Tigris towards the Persian hills. There are many subdivi sions of these tribes and also numerous other smaller tribes. The nomad Bedouins, especially the Muntafik, have been in constant conflict with Turkish rule and have hitherto supplied no soldiers to the Turkish army, in consequence of which the. local units of Baghdad and Basrah were invariably considerably below the proper strength. The Turks proper form the official classes and the ruling element of the towns. Apart from the Arabs and Turks, there are certain numbers of Chaldeans and Sabians, with some Persians and a good proportion of Jews, mainly in Baghdad itself. The Chaldeans (a Christian race who claim to be des cended from the old Assyrian stock) are not encountered as a rule so far south as Baghdad, except when engaged on work on the river. They provide the crews of the river steamers. The headquarters of the Chaldean Church is at Musal, and there is also a considerable number of this sect at Baghdad. The French, under whose protection they are, use the Chaldean Catholics as a medium of French political influence. The Sabians, another Christian sect numbering about 3,000,. claim to be followers of John the Baptist, and are mostly located; around ‘Amarah. The Nestorian Christians, whose headquarters appear to be at Babylon, desire the British to take more political interest in them and their Church. In fact they wish for official protec tion such as the Chaldeans enjoy from the French. The Russians were said in 1912 to have been anxious to offer them this facility/ and a section of the Nestorians was then parleying with them. The Shi’ahs of this part have their headquarters at the celeb- rated shrine of Karbala. They are very hostile towards the ( 46 )47 Russians on account of the latter’s “ stringent action ” towards their co-religionists, i.e., in Northern Persia, and therefore favour the British. Their power for action and their influence are, however, very limited and they lack capable leaders. The principal towns (with number of inhabitants or houses chief shown in brackets) are :—• Baghdad (145,000), Karbala (65,000). Basrah (60,000). Hillah (30,000). Najaf (12,000). •Amarah (10,000). Nasiriyah (10,000). Shatrat-al-Muntafik (500 houses). Musaiyib (6,000). Qurnah (5,000). Kut-al-Amarah (4,000). Diwaniyah, Samawah, Rumaithah (500 houses). Zubair (1,500). v • B ®* r ^i“ Trhe P°P ulation of Basrah, including suburbs, num bers 60,000, mostly composed of sedentary Arabs. There are some Europeans and Indians, about 3,000 Persians and 1 000 Jews. ’ Zubair.j-Th.* population of Zubair is virtually all Sunni Muhammadan, as is natural in a place which holds the tomb of Zubair arch-rebel against ’Ali and killed here in fighting against uj , Many notables and land-owners of the Basrah neighbour hood have country houses at Zubair, to which they retire in the hot weather m quest of a drier atmosphere ; and some important families of Central Arabian origin are also located here. oo population of Muhammareh amounts to 23,000, and that of the neighbouring district of Faflahiyeh (’Ara- bistan) to 45,000. Arabistan is potentially one of the richest pro- Vinces of Persia, but the country lacks the population necessary to develop its great agricultural resources. y ARAB TRIBES. Bawiyeh. ,, S ™g ular Ra ^ 1 - A , la rge and powerful Arab tribe of Southern Arabistan. They claim descent from Muhalhal, an Arab hero. towns.48 and consider their ancestry superior to that of the Ka'ab. The Bawiyeh number perhaps'20,000 souls and occupy along with certain small tribes dependent on them the whole of the region between the Jarrahi on the east and the Karun on the west from the confluence of the Haddam with the Gargar in the north to ’Ali-ibn-al-Husain or even Marid on the Karun in the south. A few are found also on the right bank of the Karun. The tribe are mostly nomads living in tents and owning large flocks and herds ; but on the Karun they possess the per manent villages of Kut ’Abdullah, Kut Saiyid Salih, Kut-al ’Amaireh* TJmm-at-Tamair and Ghazzawiyeh, also the more than temporary settlements of Kut Saiyid Salih, Kut Saiyid ’Anayeh and Moran. The residence of the chief Shaikh, at present Husain-bin-’Ali whose father died at an advanced ago in 1907, is at Kut-al-’Amaireh where he has a fort and house. The number of settled Bawiyeh is probably about 1,500 souls as against 18,500 who are nomads. It would appear that the Bawiyeh have 2,710 fighting men of whom 920 are mounted on horses (or rather mares) and 800 are armed with rifles, but in practice they seem unable to put as many as 2,000 warriors in the field ; on the other hand the estimated fighting strength ap pears small in proportion to the alleged total numbev ©£ the tribe. It is affirmed that the Bawiyeh as a whole pay annual revenue to the Shaikh of Muhammareh through their own Shaikh, but that certain section* are exempt and even receive allowances. Ka’ab. Pronounced Cha r ab; the singular is Ka’abi (Cha’abi). The Ka’ab are the largest and most important tribe of Southern ’Arabistan ; they are Arabs, but at the present day they are to some extent Persianised. Distribution .—The Ka’ab form almost the entire population of the Fallahiyeh District, which is their headquarters, and they also occupy the greater part of ’Abbadan island, especially to wards its lower end. A few occur in the Haffar tract on the right bank of the Karun in the Muhammareh District, and some on the left bank of the Bahmanshir, Ka’ab are found in consi derable numbers in the Jarrah District where they occupy the river bank villages of Khar Faraih, Bunwar, Bunwar RizaiqMaksar, Maksar ’Atiqeh, Suwaireh, Kurduniyeh, Maqtu’ Fan* qani, Haskeh, Maqtu’ Hadrani, Khamzeh, Sidaireh, Saraimeh, Dob-al-Mir, Tuwaiqiyeh and Qarqar, and have settlements in the interior at Dauweh, ’Aquleh, Hor Trawaishid, Idaideh, Abu Saileh, Khalafiyat, Hamad and Haji Asghayar and they spread northward into the Ahwaz District at Banneh and Shakheh : the tribe is represented also at Cham Sha’abani, Gharabi Kuchik and Hindiyan village in the Hindiyan District. Detached colo nies of Ka’ab emigrants occur further down the coast of Persia in the Liravi, Rud-Hilleh and Angali districts ; but these are tribally isolated and unimportant. In Turkish ’Iraq some immigrant Ka’ab are settled at Fao. Sub-divisions and numbers .—The structure of the Ka’ab tribe has been carefully investigated, but the results elicited are con flicting even as regards main divisions and sub-divisions. The ordinary tribesman has no ideas whatever on the subject of the composition of this tribe and the theories which are entertained by intelligent individuals here and there do not command general acceptance. One fact stands out clearly, that the tribe consists partly of original and partly of adscititious families and groups, the divisional name Dris being closely associated with the former, and that of Khanafireh with the latter of these two classes. The more minute classification of the Ka’ab depends not on blood relationship but on political accidents, for the name of a headman’s family or section is generally extended to include all who find (or place) themselves under his authority; it follows that there are many semi-obsolete names, as well as aliases both exact and partial. The Dawariqeh, are stated to be an aboriginal race distrib uted among the various branches of the Ka’ab as herdsmen and almost as serfs. It should be added that only the Dris and Nassar divisions are universally regarded as true Ka’ab ; the Khanafireh and Muqaddam are frequently described not as Ka’ab but as Tawaif, that is “ (dependent) tribes ”. There are said to be other adscititious Ka’ab also who are not included among either the Khanafireh or the Muqaddam. This is the system of classification of the Ka’ab which seems to be the most worthy of adoption out of two or three that have been propounded ; but in order to exemplify the discrepancies S212(w)GSBI 50 of opinion which exist another follows:— I. Dris. (fighting strength 6,000 men). 1. Dris 2. Nasir (A1 Bu) 3. Nassar. II. Muqaddam (fighting strength 1,100 men). 1. Is-haq 2. Maiyah 3. Muqaddam. now added in brief. It is as III. Khanafireh. (fighting strength 3,000 men). 1. Hamdi (A1 Bu). 2. Kawamil. 3. Shawardiyeh. IV. Hazbeh. (fighting strength 3,000 men). 1. Ghuwainim (AI Bu). 2. Hazbeh. 3. La’ateh (Al Bu). The total strength of the Ka’ab tribe is, and must be, largely a matter of conjecture ; but, the number of fighting men is esti mated at 15,722 as below :— Dris .. ^ ’Asavireh .. Ghubaish (Al Bu) .. Nassar .. 4,750 .. 3,042 .. 1,200 Khanafireh .. 4,680 Muquddam .. .. 2,050 Total .. 16,722 According to the principle on which fighting strength is usually calculated the figures given would represent a total of about 55,000 souls, a number which is not patently either in excess or in defect. These statistics do not include the Ka’ab colonies outside Southern ’Arabistan nor those of the Hindiyan District: the members of the latter, in number about 1,500 mostly belong to a section called Sha’abani—not shown in any classification table of the tribe that has been obtained. Arms. It may be added here that a large number of long barrelled muzzle-loaders are still seen among the Ka’ab and thatalmost every fighting man of the Dris and Khanafireh divisions is armed either with one of these or with a superior weapon. Religion and life .—The Ka’ab, like all the other tribes of Southern ’Arabistan are Muhammadans of the Sh,i’ah persuasion. They cannot, except in a few places, be described as altogether settled, nor on the other hand are any considerable proportion of them truly Bedouin. The bulk of the tribe are now in that stage of development, intermediate between nomadism and fixity which is typified by the huts—less removeable than tents and more easily abandoned than houses—in which they dwell. In out-of-the-way tracts like Shatut the Ka’ab are still very pri- mitive in their ideas and habits ; and in some places a tradition as to the iniquity of buying and selling things for money lingers amongst them. Like the Pathans of the Indo-Afghan frontier they have a strong objection to being seen in a state of nudity, and this prejudice is even said to give rise to embarrassment among themselves when rivers have to be crossed by swimming. Where the Ka’ab possess arable lands they cultivate wheat, barley and rice ; where pasture exists they own buffaloes, cattle, sheep, goats and even donkeys ; in the marshes they move about in light canoes, catching fish and snaring or shooting wild fowl; at Fallahiyeh town they are otherwise noted as the manufactur ers of very fine and light woolen ’abas for summer wear. Origin, history and political position.—The Ka’ab claim to be ’Awamir or Bani ’Amir, descended from a certain Ka’ab-bin- Rabi’-bin-’Amir who was himself they say, the 24th in descent from Ismael. It is stated that the original home of the Ka’ab was in Najd and that some of the tribe are still to be found there at a place called Bishauraniyah ; all efforts to identify this locality have, however, up to the present, been unsuccessful. According to the tribal tradition the majority of the descendants of Ka’ab eventually established themselves in North Africa; but Nassar and Dris, the legendary progenitors of the Ka’ab of Southern ’Arabistan made their way from Najd to Doraq and occupied it after expelling some other Arab tribes and some Afshar or ’Aushar Turks whom they found in possession. The date of these supposed events is altogether uncertain. Early in the seventeenth century, apparently, the capital of the Ka’ab tribe was at Qubban ; and there it remained until 1747, when a move was made to Fallahiyeh town or Doraq-al-Fallahiyeh as it was when styled. Another old settlement of the Ka’ab, since52 abandoned, was Sahrlah or Sabalah— j it stood on the right bank of the Karun river, opposite to the island of Dair and the Marid creek. The history of the Ka’ab tribes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is a part of that of ’Arabistan, which is related at length elsewhere. Here it is enough to add that shortly after 1775 the jurisdiction of the Ka’ab chiefs seems to have extended from the neighbourhood of Basrah to the confines of the Behbehan; but their influence declined as that of the Muhaisin rose and the chiefs of the Ka ab, stripped of political power, have sunk in recent years into undistinguished vassals of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The divisional Shaikhs have no political power; the most important among them are Shaikh Rizaij of the Al Bu Ghubaish (Bait Hilayil), who is in charge of Buziyeh and lives there ; Shaikh ’Abud, the head of the Khanafireh ; Shaikh Musa of the Asakireh, and Shaikh Sultan of the Muqaddam, who is at present (1908) in jail. KhazaTi, A considerable Arab tribe in Turkish ’Iraq : their country stretches approximately from Kufah to Samawah through the intervening marshes and includes a portion of the adjoining Shamiyah Desert: the settled members of the tribe are chiefly in the Qadha of Samawah. The Khaza’il are all Shi’ahs and are divided into Mu’allim,—Al Bu Hasan,—and Lamlum—; and one of their smaller sections is known as the Bani ’Aridh—. They are a strong and warlike body but not naturally pugnacious! Those who inhabit the desert are horsemen and well-mounted : those on the rivers and marshes depend for locomotion, both in peace and war, upon their mashhufs or canoes. The agricul tural part of the tribe cultivate rice, barley and wheat • sheep horses and camels also are bred by the Khaza’il, and a consider! able number of them are carriers and camel-dealers. A larcre proportion even of the agricultural sections follow the desert life between January and June. The Khaza’il levy khuwtvah from the Amzah and Northern Shammar. towards whom they are not wAl disposed, when camping in their territory. Lam (Bani). • v I 61 ? ' umer ° US T 1 im P ortan t Arab tribe found chiefly m Turkish Iraq, but also, to some extent, in Persian ’Arabia- tcin*53 tfarid is )rtly lave the sin ve of are &gt;nd Territory.—The Bani Lam country proper is the plain between the Persian hills (or Pusht-i-Kuh) and the left bank of the Tigris river from a point opposite Shaikh Sa’ad down to Amavah town. In ’Iraq, however, parties of the tribe are found as iar to the west and north as Badrah, Zurbatiyah ar.d even Mandali ; while in ’Arabistan their ordinary limit is the Karkheh river between Pa-i-Pul on the north and the Hawizeh district on the south, but they sometimes range as far as the Shaur river, espe cially below Khairabad. A detached colony of the Lawaimi section even exists beyond the Karun, on the Malih at a iew miles south-east of Nasiriyah ; but they have not now any appa rent political connection with the main body of the tribe ; and there is another, still more distant, at the village of Mirbacheh in the Ramuz district. In ’Iraq both banks of the Tigris above the country of the Bani Lam are inhabited by the Bani Rabi’ah, and below it by the A1 Bu Muhammad ; on the south-west the Pani Lam are in contact with the Muntafik, and on the north-east they are ad joined by the Faili Lurs, with some or other of whose seclions they are generally at feud. The tribal centre is in the Qadha of Duwairij, where Ghadhban-bin-Banaiyah, the chief Shaikh, has his residence in a tract known as Shamariyah ; and the dealings of the tribe are mostly with ’Amarah * own and ’Ali-al-Gharbi upon the Tigris. Divisions and numbers .—The Bani Lam consist of numerous sections which have not generally, it is said, separate habitats, but live interspersed. The chief Shaikh belongs to &lt;he Balasim division. Part of the Sagwand division of the Western Lurs is at present regarded, notwithstanding the difference of race, as connected with the Bani Lam. The former have friendly relations with Shaikh Mushattat of the Sarkhah section of the Bani Lam which is not, however, of very much importance. The number of fighting men of the tribe in ’Arabistan is approximately 8,000, and from a comparison of various discre pant accounts their military strength in ’Iraq w r ould seem to be about 10.000. In view, however, of the indefiniteness of the Turco-Persian boundary and of the mobility of some of the sections of the Bani Lam, it is probable that the two estimates to a great extent overlap : consequently it is not necessary to estimate the fighting strength of the tribe at more than 15,000 men or their total number at more than 45,000 souls.Mode of life and resources.—Except the Kinanah division who (except those settled at Mirbacheh) are entirely pastoral in their habits, the majority of all sections of the Bani Lam are agricultural and live by growing cereals. The tribe as a whole nave not yet, however, abandoned the nomad life ; for neither houses nor huts but only hair tents are found among them, and they migrate towards the hills in the cold weather and are on the move from February to June. Wheat, barley, oats, maize, millet, mash and lentils are ? m ° n S tJleir er i °P s ’ but tb ey have not much rice : their cultivation is smiting and desultory. The camels and horses of the Bani Lam are among the best in ’Iraq ; of horses their best breeds are he Jdargah, Ivasbah and Wadhnah, the two former being it is said, a monopoly of the tribe. They have also buffaloes, cattle, sheep, and donkeys and supply most of the ghi for which ’Amarah town is famous. The livestock of the Zighaib sub-division is said to consist exclusively of buffaloes, and the Iva’ab Bait Amir are also among the buffaloe-owning sections. The number ot horses possessed by that portion of the tribe which is con nected with ’Arabistan rather than with Traq has been esti mated at 1,500 and that rf their camels at 3,000 Political position and militanj importance.—The Bani Lam are with a few exceptions, Shi’ahs ; by some of them Persian is spoken as well a,s Arabic, but they are not to any appreciable extent bi-lingual. Blood feuds are rigorously prosecuted both within the tribe and against outsiders. The tribe, as a whole show great respect for their Shaikhs, to whom they are said to be blindly submissive both in peace and war; and, though much divided among themselves by feuds and factions, they do not fail to combine against outsiders. Their present head Ghadhban is described as notoriously rich and brave, but a rude and violent savage without the experience or the moderation that age gives ” • he used to have a good understanding with the Shaikh of Mu- hammareh, but it came to an end and in 1914 he joined the lurks and advanced to attack the Shaikh’s territory. ' On the Turkish side of the border the Bani Lam are generally quiet, but the Ottoman Government dare not put much pressure on them ; and though the revenue collector is treated with out ward respect he does not always succeed in recovering the de- mand m full. In Persia the Bani Lam give much trouble to the authorities and seldom pay any revenue. In Traq, where theyare probably the largest, the most powerful and the richest tribe next to the Muntafik, the land assessment of the Bani Lam is one- tenth to one fifth in kind of agricultural produce, and they are also subject to a trifling annual tax in cash per head of livestock : these imposts are generally farmed out to the Shaikhs of the tribe, who collect as much as they can. In both countries the Bani Lam are noted for their predatory tendencies, but in reality the greater part of the tribe lead a peace ful and respectable life. The proceedings of the lawless minority are said, however, to be connived at by the Shaikhs, who even accept a one-fifth share in the proceeds of their raids and rob beries. Their plunder from Turkish territory is disposed of in Persia, and vice versa. In ’Arabistan it is the Khasraj division who give the most trouble ; they attacked the “ Shushan ’ ’ steamer in April 1904, and in the summer of 1905 parties of them infested the neighbourhood of Nasiri and were not driven away without difficulty. The Kinanah also are said to raid in the Dizful district. Gangs of Bani Lam and Lur robbers sometimes come in conflict with one another: in the instances known vic tory has generally remained with the Lurs. The Bani Lam are now well supplied with modem rifles, chiefly Martinis, and are considered to be good shots, especially from the saddle. It is estimated that on the Persian side about one-third of the fight ing men are mounted and two-thirds are armed with rifles ; on the Turkish side the proportion of mounted and unmounted men is said to be about equal. Malik (Bani). Generally pronounced Bani Malich : an Arab tribe of Turkish ’Iraq not very numerous but somewhat widely disseminated. On the Tigris the Bani Malik are found between ’Azair and Qurnah village ; but here, on either side of the river, the marshes behind them are tenanted by the Ma’adan (see A1 Bu Muham mad page 58) and they are confined to the neighbourhood of the actual banks. On the Euphrates they occur at various places from Bani Malik are met with in the village on both banks from Qurnah the neighbourhood of Abdul Khasibupon the right bank. Finally there are a number of sections of the tribe who in winter cultivate the soil in the Hawizeh District of Persia and whose Shaikhs in summer make their appearance at Harthah, Abul Khasib and Da’aiji upon the Shatt-al-’Arab.In religion the Bani Malik are Shiahs. Their habitations are huts ; their crops are wheat, barley and maize ; they are cattle- owners, but they have no horses,' camels or sheep. The tribe a-e now well armed with Martini rifles. The Bani Malik above Qurnah appear to be subject to the chiefs of the Muntafik. Muhaisin. A powerful Arab tribe of which the ruling Shaikh of Muham- march is the head in Southern ’Arabistan. Distribution. The headquarters of the tribe are in Persian territory, and a majority of the Muhaisin are probably Persian subjects ; but they also occur in large, and perhaps not much inferior numbers in Turkish ’Iraq. In Persia the Muhaisin occupy all that part of the Muham- mareh District which lies north and west of the Karun and they are found in some of the northern and eastern villages of ’Abba- dan island to the south of it; they also~-extend up the banks of the Karun into the Ahwaz District, wh re their principal settle ments are Maqtu, Khifi, Milaihan, Moran, Farsiyat, Ismaili, Chimaiyan, Qajariyeh, Drisiyeh, Nathareh, and Salaihawiyeh’ but of these only Milaihan, Ismaili and Qajc.riyeh are occupied at other seasons than those of cereal cultivation. In Turkish ’Iraq the Muhaisii are settled upon the Shatt-al- ’Arab, chiefly below Basrah, their principal places on the left bank being Mohiyah, Kut Ghadhban, Kut-ash-Shaikh, Kut Suwadi, Dahaimat-il-Kabir, Dahaimat-as-Saghir, Kut-as-Sinni, Daghaimat, Nahr Jasim, Daaiji and Kharnubiyah, and, on the' right bank, Mahaulat-az-Zahair, Hamdan, Hamdan-as-Sagir and Abul Hamad : above Basrah there are Muhaisin at Katai- ban, and possibly at othe T ' places. Divisions and numbers.—The, Muhaisin in Turkish ’Iraq appear to belong almost entirely to the Bait Kana’an section. The Abu Hamreh—in Northern ’Arabistan, who are said to have 200 fighting men and to frequent the country, south of the Haddam towards its source, are considered by some to be a section of the Muhaisin ; but others class them as Hamaid. The A1 Bu ’Atuwi section of the Bawiyeh were originally Muhaisin and in some respects still belong to the tribe. The fighting strength of the Muhaisin proper in Persia territory would appear to be about 6,000, and the present Shaikhof Muhammareh estimates it at double that number; but a computation by settlements gives the total number of Muhaisin in Persia as about 12,000 souls only. It is estimated that about two-thirds of the fighting men of the tribe are armed with rifles and that about one-sixth of the total muster are provided with horses. Mode of life and character .—The Muhaisin in Persia are a settled, but not altogether a sedentary tribe, having their per manent headquarters in the Muhammareh District: at their homes they are cultivators of dates, but they also grow wheat and barley upon both banks of the Karun as far up as Moran and even in the vicinity of Wais. Their custom is to leave the Muham mareh neighbourhood in November for their grain lands on the Karun; in February, after sowing these, they return to Maham- mareh to fertilise their dates; in May they visit the Karun to reap their crops of wheat and barley; in June or July they reappear at Muhammareh in expectation of the date harvest, which begins at the middle of July. The Muhaisin own many sheep and goats, some cattle and a few buffaloes; when they return from the Ahwaz to the Muhammareh District they leave part of their flocks in charge of section of the Bawiyeh tribe. In religion, except some of the Bait Ghanim, who are Sunnis, the Muhaisin are all Shi’ah Muhammadans. They are described as a cheerful and lazy race, thoroughly amenable to tribal custom and authority. Origin, history and political position .—The Muhaisin are said to be descended from a certain man whose name was Muhaisin and from his son-in-law Kasib (pronounced Chasib). Tradition represents these individuals as belonging to a tribe of the Muham mareh District whom the encroachments of their neighbours the Ka’ab, compelled to emigrate and to settle on the Tigris under the name of Al Husain Pasha. Muhaisin and Kasib how ever, having purchased land near the site of the present town of Muhammareh from the Ka’ab returned with some followers to their native country and founded the Mahaisin tribe, of which the headship has remained vested in the house of Kasib. The later authentic history of the Muhaisin is included in that of ’Arabistan. Here it is enough to observe that on the conclu sion of the Anglo-Persian war in 1857 Haji Jabir, then head of the tribe, was recognised by the Persian Government as Shaikh of Muhammareh in his own right and with plenary powers ; the Shaikhship up to that time had been held by him merely as S212(w)GSB58 nominee of the Ka’ab Shaikh. Shortly afterwards, the Shaikh of the Ka’ab having been deported to Tehran, the Fallahiyeh District was placed in charge of his Muhaisin rival; and, except during one short interval from 1860 to 1862, the heads of the Ka’ab tribe have ever since been in subordination to the Shaikh of the Muhaisin, or as he is now generally called, the Shaikh of Muhammareh.* At the present time the Muhaisin, in conse quence of the authority wielded by their head over all the districts of Southern ’Arabistan, may be regarded though still outnumbered by the Ka’ab, as the paramount tribe in all that region. Muhammad (Al Btr). A largo but socially inferior and possibly non-Arab tribe, located partly in Turkish 'Iraq and partly in Persian ’Arabistan : they a,rc practically indistinguishable from the Ma’adan, — most M .’adan admitting th' mselves to bo Al Bu Muhammad, and vice versa. The remarks which follow apply indifferently to both tribes. Distribution. —From 'Amarah down to 'Azair the Al Bu Muhammad inhabit tho swampy land on both banks of the Tigris extending inland from the left bank as far as the Hawizeh dis trict and from the right bank to the furthest limit of the marshes ; but branches of them are found as far from the tribal head quarters as Ghabishiyah—near Suq-ash-Shuyukh, the Suwaib creek on the left bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab, Burmat ’Ali on the right bank some miles above Basrah town and parts of the Kut- al-Amarah Qadha. One of their principal settlements is Majar-al-Kabir, and Qal’at Salih is their chief market town. Wandering Ma’adan, perhaps of this tribe, appear with their buffaloes at certain seasons in the Muhammareh and Falahiyeh Districts of Southern ’Arabistan, Divisions. —The sub-divisions of the Al Bu Muhammad arq said to be “ innumerable as worms ” s but none of them are well enough known to deserve mention, and no estimate of the total strength of the tribe is possible. Mode of life and social matters.—The Al Bu Muhammad all live in reed huts, and within the limits of the tribal territory. *The Shaikh, it is said, now sometimes describes himself as Shaikh of the Ka'ab.59 Numbers of them ore perpetually on the move, engaged in fishing Td shooting ; nevertheless they may be regarded a tribe.

It follows that the bulk of the tribe were under the Government of Basrah and comparatively few under that of Baghdad. The chief towns in the Muntafik country are Suq-ash- Shuyukh, Shatrat-al-Muntafik and Nasiriyah, and the tribe also frequent the town of Samawah. ' Divisions .—Ko estimate of the number of the Muntafik is possible and their sub-divisions are innumerable ; but they are sometimes classified under the three heads of Ajwad, Bani Sa’id or Sa ad, and Bani Malik ; of these the first are predominant in the Euphrates Valley above Hammar, the second are chiefly found upon the Tigris and Shatt-f.l-’Arab and have their centre about Qurnah, and the third, which are not very numerous, widely disseminated, being found on the Euphrates, Tigris and in the Hawizeh district. The term Muntafik is properly applicable to the central core only of the great tribal congeries of which the territorial limits have been described above; but in use it has become extended to the whole. Some of the components of the tribe in the wider sense occasionally separate themselves from the gefieral body and this is considered to be the position at present of the Bani Malik, and in a lesser degree of the Ajwad. Various client tribes also, though not included under the name, are closely asso ciated with the Muntafik ; such were formerly the Bani Mansur and Ahl Jazair. Part of the once famous Bani Khalid tribe is believed to have been absorbed in the Muntafik. Mode of life.—A large part of the Muntafik tribe is still bedouin ; but the remainder inhabit tents, reed-huts, villages and even towns; cultivate the land, grow dates, and breed sheen, cattle, buffaloes and camels ; many, however, even those who belong to the settled pastoral sections, rove the desert in spring with their flocks and herds for the sake of the grazing. The Muntafik women do not veil their faces. Religion &gt;i ml politiccil posit ion .— Fhe tribesmen generally are Shi’ah, but the ruling Shaikhs and their sub-division, called the Sa’idun, are Sunnis. n61 c§&gt; The Sa’idun are said to have come from Mecca not quite 500 years ago, and their authority over the tribe was unlimited till about 20 years since, when the Turks removed the Shaikh of the day from the official headship. Some of the desert sections still ignore the Turkish Government and obey no orders those of the Sa’idun. The Muntafik are at enmity w'tt. tho Bani Babi’ah and with the Northern Shamman In war toy carry swords and lances, and they are well armed with rifles chiefly Martinis ; a large proportion of their mounted men camel riders. (See also page 85.) Rabi’ah (Bani). A strong and well-to-do Arab tribe in Turkish ’Iraq. Territory .—The Bani Rabi’ah inhabit both sides of the Tigris in the neighbourhood of Kut-al-Aniarah: on bank their territory extends from opposite Bghailah to lvut- Amarah and on thought bank from B rhailah to Shaikh Sa al uith a depth in either case of 20 to 25 miles from the river, iney Im alo found sporadically in other placc^ as for example at Mahmudiyah on the route between Baghdad and Kama . Divisions and number.-'^ principal divisions of the Bam Rabi’ah are the Amarah, the largest of the clans °n e from which the Shaikhs are drawn, occupying the right bank ot h 'Tigris for some distance below Bghailah ; the Maiyah m the ande between the Tigris and the right bank of the Shatt-al- Gharaf • the Sarai or Sira] in the corresponding position between the left bank of the Shatt-al-Gharaf and the sS * Hai Town ; the Maqasis between the Sarai and Sha’kh Sa a , the Bulhah—between the Amarah and the Maiyah , Khammas—upon the left bank of the Tigris. A section al ed Aaraish are found chiefly in the Kut-al-Amhxah Qadha the most important of their sub-sections are (1) the Kawam who a e found on the left bank of the Tigris between Kufa - Amar town and occur also in the Kadhimain Qadha an ( ) , , Tamim who are represented as Saiyids by the other Bani a and wear their hair long ; they engage m agriculture ati a so _ robbery, and some of them are considered to belong o c Lam rather than to the Bani Rabi’ah. There is also a predatory section called Kinanah every member of which owns a breech loading rifle. 4 . ci In number the Bani Rabi’ah are inferior to the MuntatUc and the Bani Lam but no exact estimate is possible. ►62 Religion and life. AU the Bani ftabfah, with the exception o the Jvawam, are Shi’ahs by religion and live in tents ; they jo h cultivate themselves and employ others to cultivate for them ; their chief crops are wheat and barley ; they possess many sheep, cattle, horses, and camels. Military strength and political position.—Ahont one-furth o e lighting strength of the tribe are horsemen and are well mounted. A proportion of old-fashioned firearms ii still carried by the Bani Rabi'ah, who are in fact on the border line between the well-armed tribes of Lower and the worse-armed tribes of Upper Iraq. As revenue to the Turkish Government, the Bani Rabi’ah pay one-fifth produce on account of lands classified as easily i 65 anC ^ one '^ en ^h for those which are only irrigable with difficulty: there is also a tent-tax of 3 Majidis a year, but it is not rigorously collected. Salih (Bani). A large and strong Arab tribe of the Hawizeh district in Southern ’Arabistan, amounting to perhaps 15,000 souls Their territory from north to south has an extent of about 20 miles, beginning a few miles south of Hawizeh town; its eastern boun- arj is at a place called Shaikh Muhammad ; and on the west it includes part of the Karkheh or Karkheh-Tigris marshes. The majority of the tribe engage in wheat and barley cultivation and own large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, besides about 3,000 camels ; but certain of the subdivisions inhabit the marshes, where they cultivate rice, keep buffaloes and cattle, and move a jout in mashhuf.s and taradahs. The fighting strength of the Bani Salih is estimated at 1,000 horsemen and 3,350 footmen, and the porportion of rifles is about 1 to every 3 men. The tribe is Shi’ah in religion. Tup.uf (Bani). A large and powerful Arab tribe in the Hawizeh district of Southern ’Arabistan, numbering some 20.000 souls and occupying the whole of the country watered by the Karkheh below Kut Nahr Hashim, including the marshes. The Seat of the ruling family, who belong to the A1 Bn ’Adhar, is at Khafa iyeh, on the left bank of the main stream several hours to the west of Kut Nahr Hashim, where there is a bazaar of about 00 mud-built shops.A colony of the Banl Turuf has recently been planted by the Shaikh of Muhammareh on the Khaz’ali canal in the Fallahiyeh district, and by some the indigenous inhabitants of Ma’shur are believed to be of Bani Turuf extraction. The Bani Turuf are Shi’ahs. They live in huts made of mats, reeds and grass, and they subsist chiefly by agriculture, but are also stock-breeders ; rice is their staple crop ; some wheat and barley are also cultivated by them, and they are said to own 20,000 head of buffaloes and cattle, but no sheep. They export large quantities of rice and hides to ’Aniarah via Hawizeh, and send ghi by direct caravan to Muhammareh and Basr&amp;h. Piece-goods, sugar and coffee they obtain principally from ’Amarah; but their tobacco conies from Shushtar. The Bani Turuf fall into two main divisions, the Bait Sa’id and the Bait Saiyah, and can muster about 5,fl00 fighting men, of whom two-thirds possess rifleS; but only some 50 men, belonging to the families of the Shaikhs, are mounted. The Bani Turuf have from time to time resisted the authority of the Shaikh of Muhammareh in the Hawizeh district, but without much success. They are generally characterised as thieves and robbers. ZUBAID. A numerous and widely distributed Arab tribe in Turkish Traq: their territory covers the whole of Mesopotamia from Baghdad city and Musaiyib on the north to Bghailah and the Dagharah marshes on the south. With the exception of the Bani ’Ajail and’Azzah (or some of those sections) who are Sunnis, the whole Zubaid tribe is Shi’ah. They dwell in the usual black tents, or at best in huts ; they are agriculturists, cultivating wheat, barley, rice and maize, but not sesame; and they breed horses, camels, cattle, and sheep, but no buffaloes. The Zubaid are not as yet particularly well armed with rifles. They are politically allied with the Dilaim and have a standing feud with the Northern Shammar. Their recognised chief at the present time is Rashid Baig, who lives 10 or 12 miles west of Suwairah.\ C4 Language. The most generally spoken language in Mesopotan ia is Arabic. The Turkish officials spoke Turkish and some of them French in addition. Hindustani and English are little understood. Persian is Spoken. The Muhammadan Religion. The cardinal doctrine of the Muhammadan religion, which is called “ Islam ” (literally “ submission to God ”), is pure theism, formulated in the words “ There is but one God.” It also accepts the divine missions of Moses, Christ, and Muham mad. A hnal judgment, an after state, a heaven and hell, good and bad spirits, and guardian angels are amongst the tenets of the religion, which inculcates also the virtues of almsgiving, truth, sobriety, and mercy to animals. Its rites include punctilious and ceremonious prayer, ablutions, circumcision, pilgrimage, and abstinence from alcoholic drinks. The holy book of the Muhammadans is the Koran, which is written in Arabic and was compiled from the sayings of the Pro phot. It embodies portions of the Old and New Testaments. Both Christians and Jews are considered as possessing the scriptures, and are called by Moslems “ People of the Book.” Of lesser importance than the Koran, but also much vene rated, are the “ Sunnat ”, or traditions of the faith. Muhammadans are divided into two main sects—Sunnis and Shi’ahs. Of these the former are generally regarded as the Orthodox party. The Sunnis acknowledge the succession of the first four Khalifahs, Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman, and *Ali, as rightful successors of Muhammad, and the subsequent Khalifahs down to the present Turkish Sultan. These are all considered to have inherited the spiritual and temporal supremacy bequeathed by the Prophet. The Shi’ahs, who are held to be heretics by the Sunnis, deny the first four Khalifahs and the present succession- They recognize as the first true 1 mam, ’Ali, who married the Prophet’sdaughter, Fatimah, and had two sons, Hassan and Husain. These two, early in the history of Islam, took up ar ; i:s against the reigning Khalifah and were defeated in battle ; their dynasty soon ceased to exist. The Slu’aks now acknowledge no spiritual head, but look for the re-apj earance of Imam-al-Mahdi. Their chief temporal prince is the Shah of Persia. In distinction to the Sunnis, who hold that truth can only be found in tradition, they maintain that certain learned doctors have a. rigid to use their judgment. A third section of Muhammadans are the Wahabis, who are generally akin to the Sunnis, but are reformers of a puritan type. They inhabit Central Arabia. A fourth division are the Moors, who are otherwise Sunnis, but regard their own Sultan as Khalifah. All the chief centres of Islam, i.e.., Mecca, Medina, Constanti nople, Da mascus, Baghdad, Cairo, Delhi, Kabul and Bokhara, afb thus Sunni. The main places of pilgrimage for i he Sunnis’ are Mecca and Medina in Western Arabia, while the Shi’ahs holy cities are Karbala, to the south of Baghdad, and Meshed, in north-east Persia. The Haj, usually so called, is the Sunni pilgrimage from Constantinople and Cairo to Mecca. But many thousands of Persians and Indians go yearly to Karbala, and some, though far fe ver, to Mecca. The Muhammadan religion in Turkey differs from most other faiths in having no regular priesthood. The Ulama or “ learned”, were originally no more than a body of inter preters of the Koran. But as the Koran contains not only the ecclesiastical but also the secular law, this body soon came to exercise a considerable influence in the councils of the state. This influence has almost invariably been exerted in a spirit hostile to Christianity end to general progress. The head of the Ulama is the Shaikh-ul-Islam, an official who, in certain matters of doctrine, wields a power equal to that of the Sultan himself. Another potentate of great local power is the Grand Sharif of Mecca, who is the head of the Qoraish tribe, the hereditary S2l2(w)GSBguardian of the holy places, and the feudal chief of half the tribes of Arabia. The Sultan, however, is the Khalifah or accepted spiritual head of Islam, as well as the temporal sovereign of Turkey, and his position and prestige throughout the Muhammadan world are indissolubly bound up with the Khalifate, which itself largely de ends on the possession of the holy places in Arabia.( 67 ) CHAPTER IV. RESOURCES. Water. Kuwait .—See page 41. U'inm Qasr .—There are three small wells of brackish water in the Turkish fort about 8 feet deep. It is reported that there are other wells “ with a plentiful supply ” about 250 yards to the north of the fort. The level of fresh water, which is only slightly brackish, is said to be only 8 feet below the surface. It would probably be advisable to arrange to supplement the water-supply from ships, for any body of troops exceeding two battalions. Fao .—At the Fao telegraph station there are seven tanks, each with a capacity of 400 gallons. Drinking water is also obtained from the Shatt-al-’Arab. Basrah .—Best water is from the open stream of the Shatt-al- ’Arab, but this is not very wholesome owing to drainage from swampy areas. The water from the ’Ashar canal is drunk by the poorer classes, but as they use the canal as “ wash-tub, bath, dust-bin and cess-pool,” it had better be avoided. Norton tube wells would be useful at any camps away from the river, and their use was recommended after the 1857 expedi tion. Watering animals in the river is difficult, as the banks shelve and after the fall of the tide near Muhammareh a large extent of muddy b .nk is exposed. To obviate this difficulty pumps, with a length of pipe to run the water into troughs, should be taken. Baghdad .—In some quarters of the town water is laid on by pipes from the Tigris ; the water is pumped up by an oil en gine, but no attempt is made to filter it, and the silt is not even allowed to settle. In other parts of the town water is provided by carriers. Many houses have private wells, but the water in these is not sweet and not suitable for drinking ; the level in the wells varies with the level of the Tigris.\ In 1911 estimates were being prepared to provide the town with a proper water-supply. For water-supply of towns along the Tigris and Euphrates see pages 26 to 30, and also Routes in Chapter VIII. (See p. 123.) ’Arabistan .—The water of the Karun, Diz, and Jarrahi rivers is good and sweet ; there is therefore no difficulty about scarcity of water at Muhammarah, Ahwaz, or Shushtar, or any- where on the routes connecting these places. (See pages 167 to 178.) On the cross route Maksar to Ahwaz water is scarce. At Ramuz water is good and plentiful. See note regarding Norton tube wells under Basrah Muhammareh .—At Muhammareh the water of the Karun river (i. e., the Hafar canal or Bahmanshir canal) is considered to be better than that of the Shatt-al-’Arab, while both are better than the water of the irrigation canals which take off from the rivers. Wells at Muhammareh only contain brackish water. In 1857 water tapped at a depth of 23 feet, one mile inland, was also found to be brackish. Bandar Md’shur .—At Bandar Ma’shur water is rather scarce and some of it is not good. It consists of the following :— (a) An open tank, to the east of the town, upon which the townspeople depend for 8 months of the year. (b) Many small wells in-the town with brackish and un healthy water. (c) An underground cistern west of the town with excellent water, kept as a reserve. (d) The river Jarrahi with excellent water, but about 15 miles distant. Supplies. General .—There is comparatively little production in this region generally. Dates form the main article of export. The value of grain, barley, and wheat exported in 1909 amounted to £600,000. The failure of the harvest is a factor always to be reckoned with, both in ’Iraq and ’Arabistan. The average amount of wheat exported from Baghdad during 1907-08-09 was 15,000 tons.Torn is sown about November and December and harvested in May or June. An autumn crop of maize, harvested about December, is often raised as well. In the Baghdad Wilayat in 1905 a tax was levied on 57,000 buffaloes a.nd 122,000 sheep. The following table gives amounts available locally. How far these figures would be able to be realized in war, cannot be estimated :— article. Muhammareh. Basrab. Fuel Date trees, some coal and oil. Wood can be collected from Ab-i-Diz. Date trees are very difficult to fell; and are valuable to their owners. Oil fuel can be obtained from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s works at ’Abbadan. Date tmes. A small prickly shrub called shuq grows outside the town. Coal is stored tor river steamers. Average stock with Grey, Mackenzie and Co. is about 800 tons. Fodder Some lucerne might be available, also chopped straw after a good harvest . Wheat and barley arc grown and ex ported . There is little information regarding grazing for camels but some camels are always found in the vicinity. Grazing on both banks of th° river, above and below Basrah town.

Dates are the staple tood or the country. • * The districts affording the best supplies are the banks of the Karun river especially above Ahwaz, Shushtar, Diz'ul hailaniyeh, Hindiyan, and Ramuz. These could provide suffi cient gram for the needs of at least one division. Shushtar alone, which also has many water mills, could probably supply the needs of one division for several months. Ahwaz could probably support a brigade for a month. Mesopotamia could also provide large supplies of cereals. Sheep, goats and cattle are obtainable in North ’Arabistan, but not so easily in Southern ’Arabistan. Between December and February sheep and goats are difficult to obtain. At Muhammareh there is only one large flour mill. Onions beans and fish are procurable, and there is a good bazaar for native goods. Milk is scarce. Apples are obtainable in May, melons and dates in August. At Bandar Ma’shur there is scanty grazing, and very little cultivation ; fodder is brought from the Jarrahi or Hindiyan dis tricts. Fuel is obtainable from small bushes only, which are cut within a radius of 10 miles. At Ramuz wood-fuel and charcoal are cheap. There are fuel depots for steamers at Ahwaz, Band-i-Qir and Shalaili. Fuel is also abundant at Shushtar and Dizful. At Dizful in spring the grazing is excellent. Transport. Transport. Muhammareh. Basrah. Wheeled vehicles Nil Nil.

In the whole of the Baghdad wilayat the number of animals upon which tax was collected in 1905 was:'— Camels .. .. .. 87,787 Donkeys .. .. .. 67,416 In addition to these classes of animals there are said to be born annually 85,000 horses, 4,000 mules, and 155,000 head of cattle. In the town of Baghdad the following transport animals could be procured at short notice :— Donkeys .. .. .. 1,000 Camels .. .. .. 1,000 Pack mules and ponies .. 800 (together with 80 four-wheeled pilgrim wagons, and 20 local carriages). Mules can be bought in Mesopotamia, where some 5,000 pack mules are in use. In 1857, 2,500 camels were bought in Basrah and 8,000 mules in Baghdad. 'Arabistan. The mule is more suitable than the camel in ’Arabistan, as water and fodder can be got daily, whilst camel grazing is apparently scarce. With at least one month’s notice and the inhabitants friendly, the following transport might be collected - Ramuz Mules. Camels. Don keys. 200 Shush tar and from Bakhtiaris 300 .. 1,000 Dizful and from Lurs 1,000 300 Fallahiyeh and Hindiyan 100 Muhammareh • « 1,000Caravans, complete with native equipment and charvadars under their own headmen, should be engaged. No bullocks are available in ’Arabistan. For Resources, Kuwait, see page 42. Trade. There is comparatively little production in Mesopotamia gen erally. The date palm constitutes the principal feature in the landscape from Baghdad southwards, and dates form the main article of export. Opium has, however, of late years shown a considerable increase in production, and the same may be said of gum from the Persian hills, though the shrub producing this is failing on account of indiscriminate tapping. In 1909 wool was the biggest item of export after dates, but in previous years, and notwithstanding the fact that the most is not made of the land in an agricultural sense, the value of the barley and wheat exported amounted to over £ 600,000, or one-third of the total exports. In 1909 the amount of these cereals was reduced to practically nothing on account of inadequate rainfall during the winter and tribal disturbances. Other articles of export include carpets (mostly from Persia), liquorice and seeds ; also an average yearly of 2,000 horses to Bombay. The total value of the export trade from Basrah in 1909 amounted to £ 1,504,000, of which about half came from Bagh dad, and of which about 50 per cent, went to the British Empire. The value of the imports exceeds the value of the exports by £ 856,102, the principal items being cotton, silk and woollen goods, and sugar. Nearly the whole of the imports go to Bagh dad, and somewhat over 50 per cent, come from the British Em pire. As regards the carrying trade from the port of Basrah, the total tonnage of ships entering and leaving the port amounted in 1909 to 393,491 tons, of which 356,729 was British and 12,728 Turkish. There is a branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Basrah.73 The following lines of steamers used to Pall regularly at Basrah and Muhammareh. The British India Steam Navigation Company, running weekly with Gulf mails from Karachi and Bombay, and fortnightly with local mails. The Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, every fortnight from Bombay. The Anglo-Arabian and Persian Steamship Companv, direct from England- Bucknal Brothers, direct from England. The West Hartlepool Steamship Company, direct from England. The Hamburg-Amerika Line used to sail monthly from Hamburg and Antwerp. A Russian subsidised steamer calls three or four times a year, and an occasional Austrian-Lloyd. For the date season numerous steamers are chartered. Ihe European firms with offices at Basrah are ■— {i) Lynch and Company. Employed in the carrying trade up Tigris and Karun rivers. (#) Gray, Mackenzie and Company. Shipping Agents, (m) Strick and Company. Shipping. (iv) MacAndrew, Lorbes and Company, American firm Exporters of liquorice. (v) Basrah Trading Company, British firm.

Thorneycroft). 3. Messrs. Sassoon and Co., of Bombay. There are several German firms. A branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank is located in Baghdad and there are three steam factories, for cloth, ice and com, respectively. For trade of Kuwait see page 42,© CHAPTER V. in MILITARY. The first step taken to give effect to the wish of the Turkish tion e i 9 i 3 UiSa * Government to reform and reorganise the Turkish Army after German Mis- the Balkan War was to appoint General Liman von Sanders to sl011 - the command of the 1st Turkish Army Corps in December 1912 (?). The appointment was made on the ground that “ the results of the employment of foreign advisers were unsatisfactory, and it was therefore proposed that foreign officers should enter the Turkish service altogether and receive actual commands. This course had already been adopted in the appointments of Rear-Admiral Limpus to command the navy, and of the English Colonel Hawker to command the gendarmerie in Armenia. Owing, however, to the protests of Russia, the status of General von Sanders was changed and he became Inspector- General of the Turkish Army instead of Commander of the 1st Army Corps. A Turkish General was appointed to the com mand of the 1st Army Corps with a German officer as his Assistant. ♦ The “ Military Mission ” which accompanied General von Sanders to Constantinople comprised ten other German officers. Of these General Bronsart V. Schellendorf was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff. The Grand Vizier assured the Ambassadors of the Triple Entente that the functions of General von Sanders would be strict ly confined to purely technical questions and military training— in other words that the duties of the German military mission would be purely instructional. Five Army Corps of 3 Divisions each were to be quartered in Distribution. ' Thrace and Western Asia Minor. The three Army Corps on ( 75 ) By the end of May 1914 the numbers of the Mission had risen to close on 50 officers. Under the new scheme (May 1914) the Turkish Army is to be organised in 13 Army Corps and 2 inde pendent Divisions.76 Strength of Unit*. Cavalry. Artillery. Transport and Medical. thf; Russian frontier were to be brought up to full strengtn, i.e., 3 Divisions each. The Arab provinces were to be held by 5 Army Corps of 2 Divisions each, and 2 independent Divisions, total 12 Divisions. The total strength of the Army is now 38 Divisions, as against 43 Divisions in 1910, and it is better concentrated than when Turkey held Albania, Macedonia and Tripoli. Each division is composed of three regiments and a Rifle battalion. To each Army Corps should be attached a 2-batta lion Rifle regiment, but only nine such regiments exist at pre sent. It is difficult to form any idea of the war-effective of these battalions. The peace-effective of those which have passed through Constantinople on their way to their new quarters in Asia Minor varies from 300-400 bayonets, whilst those station ed at Constantinople average 400. The Turkish cavalry is underhorsed and will not be able to put more than 50 per cent. of its nominal effective into the field for some time to come. Owing to the heavy losses of material during the Balkan war, most of the batteries in Asia are armed with old B. L. Krupp Field guns, and it is doubtful whether the first 4 Army Corps are entirely supplied with Q. F. guns. Very heavy expenditure must be made to supply these defi ciencies. Nothing seems to have been decided as to the re organisation of the Transport and Sanitary Services. The heavy losses among officers and men from disease in 1912-13, especially in Thrace, w'here typhus raged, show that the latter service requires to be thoroughly reformed. The pay of the Tur kish soldier is always in arrears, and the movement of troops is sometimes impossible without borrowing funds from local mer chants. As there is a strong tendency for the officers to meddle with polities, the discipline in the commissioned ranks would appear to be questionable.79 Turkish Troops, Mesopotamia. In 1912 the Turkish Army was reorganised into Army Corps. Some progress in this reorganisation was made in Europe and Asia Minor • but in Mesopotamia funds were not forthcoming, and little had been done by 1913, when the Balkan War threw everything still further back. The rank and file of the 12th and 13th Corps are mostly Arabs, the remainder being Turks, Anatolians from Asia Minor (both Musalman and Christian) and a few Kurds. The infantry are hardy and good natural soldiers, but are not well trained in Mesopotamia. They are armed with Mauser rifles of two or three different patterns. The artillery in the 12th and 13th Corps are still mostly armed with old pattern (O. P.) guns. The only Q E. guns reported were one mountain battery of 4 guns at Baghdad and one of 4 guns at Musal (July 1912). These were 7-5 c. m. Krupp guns firing a shell of 13 or 14 lbs. The cavalry regiments are not well mounted, and not highly trained. They are barely a match for the local Arab mounted tribesmen. Strengths .—The total actual strength of the two corps in regular troops in 1914 was as follows : Baghdad (and Basrah). Musal. Rifles Sabres Guns Machine guns .. 3,280 4,720 900 850 58 56 6 • • To expand the above regular (nizam) formations to war strength the ihtiyat, or active reserve, would be called out. It is doubtful, however, whether the most strenuous efforts could add more than 50 per cent, of personnel to the above actual strengths of the regular units. The Redif, or second reserve, has almost ceased to exist in Turkey since the Balkan War of 1913. Nominally the 12th and 13th Corps each have two Redif Divisions, the nominal strength of which is 30,855 rifles. The numbers actually under arms at the depots in 1914 were about 10 or 12 per regiment. The rifles were stored chiefly Fighting qualities. Reserves.80 Total nominal, strength. Frontier Com panies. at Baghdad, Musal and Ruwanduz. The men have received very little training, and all arrangements for supply, clothing, trans port, would have to be improvised. There is no cavalry and no artillery for these divisions. In place of the commanders of Redif Divisions, a number of “ officers commanding reserves ” have been appointed to various stations, but it is not known how these reserves are to be em - ployed in war. The nominal total strength of the whole of the 4th Inspec torate, namely the Baghdad and Musal Army Corps, and the Redif Divisions, is as follows. It is purely a paper figure and could not under any ordinary conditions be attained :— Rifles .. .. .. .. 74,685 Sabres .. .. .. .. 3,600 Guns .. .. .. .. 120 • Machine guns .. .. .. 48 There are 11 frontier companies, each nominally 100 strong, which were raised in 1912 from a nucleus (10 each company) of regular troops and enlistments from local races, in order to release regulars from detachments, and at the same time provide employment for the Kurds, etc. The three companies of Bagh dad reached a strength of about 50 each, and were sent to gar rison the posts near Khaniqin, Mandali and Basrah. The com panies from Musal (8 in number) have their headquarters at Naghirdeh, Pasveh, Sardasht, Baneh, Panjvin, Gulambar, Hala- bjah, and Balavireh. (Many of these places have since been handed back to Persia.) These may be referred to as “Gen darmerie ” (Buluk-i-Hadud).

Under the old organization, battalions were located as follows (April, 1911):— Nizam .—Baghdad and environs, 11 battalions; single battalions at -Amarah, Nasiriyah, Najaf, A1 Hasa and Muntafik country. Redi f .—Baghdad and environs, 6 battalions ; country north and east of Baghdad, 4 battalions ; single battalions at ’Amarah, Karbala, Najaf, Hfllah, Kut, Diwamyah and Muntafik country. As regards artillery, it is uncertain what the allotment was. There were from 6 to 9 batteries of old pattern field guns located in the area and 2 batteries of mountain guns (one b ^ tte5 'y . ot these being 0. F.). There was also 1 battery of Hotchkiss machine guns. Companies of fortress artillery were located at Basrah, Fao, and Baghdad. In May 1913 Bin Sa’ud of Najd suddenly attacked the Turkish garrisons in Hasa and summarily ejected them. The Turkish garrison of Qatar remained pending the signing of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement. It now consists of 180 men of the 112th Regiment. Fighting qualities of lo&lt; al Arabs of Mesopotamia* Of the tribes, the largest and most powerful is the Muntafik (see page 59). No estimate of the Muntafik is available, but they had 1,500 men in rebellion against the Turks at one time, ohaikh Sa’adun, the late Chief of the Muntafik, collected, in 1910, against the Kuwait forces, from his own followers and other tribes, some *The 31st and 32nd Cavalry Regiments were formed into Gendarmerie m 1913.86 4,000 horsemen, and a large number oMismounted men (no num bers given), but no fA/dwfa (riding camels). The Muntafik carry in war swords and lances. They are ajso armed with rifles, chiefly Martinis. In the past they have been in rebellion against the Turkish Government. The Bani Lam Arab (see page 52) tribe is also usually in a state of passive resistance towards the Turks. They have recently (1914) had trouble with the Shaikh of Muhammareh. For Bani Turuf see page 62. The tribes in the Basrah Wilayat, generally, have probably as many rifles as they can afford to buy. The favourite pattern is the Martini, but there is also a sprinkling of Mausers. Where breech-loaders are deficient, the favourite substitute is a double- barrelled muzzle-loading gun. Other weapons are swords, 12- foot lances with a formidable blade, curved daggers about a foot long, double-edged, and very sharp at the point. For several years the Arabs hare been very friendly towards the British, and on several occasions prominent chiefs have come forward with suggestions of a British Protectorate. Kuwait. The Kuwait unit of organization is the khabra. A khabra consists of 10 men with their arms and probably 100 rounds of ammunition each. 7 thaluls or riding camels, with their equipment. Food for as many days as may be ordered. The expedition organized in 1910, against the Muntafik may be taken as a guide towards the maximum probable strength of the Kuwait forces, viz .— 600 khabras .. .. .. 6,000 men with 4,200 thaluls. Unorganized Bedouins .. 6.000 Probably at the disposal of the Shaikh from more southern tribes .. 4,000 Probable maximum total 16,000awnr 87 Many rifles and much ammunition have reached Kuwait from Masqat, during 1911-14, and the followers of the Shaikh of Kuwait are well armed. Defence of Kuwait. —A line of sand-hills and somewhat broken ground, about a mile outside the town, affords a fairly satisfac tory line of defence, and might be made strong enough by suit able preparation to resist any probable attack. The line extends in an arc, enclosing the town on the land side, with both flanks resting on the sea, and capable of being supported by naval fire, though at a somewhat long range, i.e., up to 4,000 and 5,000 yards. Certain conspicuous points, shown on the chart, facilitate the direction and ranging of ship’s fire from the stations indicat ed by the names of the ships told off to these positions in 1901-02, viz., His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx, ” His Majesty’s ship “ Po- mone, ” and His Majesty’s ship “ Redbreast. ” In addition to this strictly naval support, native dhows if armed with machine guns, -would be useful in shoal water on either flank, and would be able to bring fire to bear at a much shorter range than those mentioned with reference to the ships. Starting from the right or western flank of this defensive line it runs (a) along certain existing excavations and old wells, for a distance of about 1,500 yards, (b) thence in a north-easterly direction along the outer edge of a strip of broken ground, broken apparently by what seem to be disused lime pits, offering cover, and capable of adaptation, and thence (c) trending more to the north, over level open ground, the line would have to be con structed with a trench or otherwise, closing on the sea near Ras- al-’Ajuzah. The extent of front thus taken up is approximately 6,000 yards, and, as has been said, could be supported on both flanks by fire from ships, which would be able to bring a cross fire to * bear, though at long range, in front of the centre of the position. Such was the line of defence selected J&gt;y the Senior Naval Officer in 1901, when it seemed possible that an attack might be imminent. ’Arabistax. Regulars. —No regular Persian troops of any fighting value exist in ’Arabistan. It is intended, eventually, to locate 500 Gendarmerie at Isfahan and there are about 400 at Burujird. It is improbable that they would oppose us as a whole, though88 individuals might desert to the enemy. There are no other Gendarmes in ’Arabistan or the neighbourhood. Irregulars .—The tribesmen with whom we must be prepared to deal are :—• (1) The Arabs of ’Arabistan. (2) The Bakhtiaris. (3) The Kuhgalus. (4) The Lurs, including the Sagwand and Dirakwand, Bairanwand and the Lurs of Pusht-i-Kuh. The probability of these tribes acting in concert against us is slight. In the event of hostilities between us and any one of the above, the others would probably seek to benefit by adopt ing a friendly attitude towards us. The Bakhtiaris and the Kuhgalus both dislike the Arabs, whilst the Bakhtiaris distrust the Kuhgalus, and all are usually at enmity with the Lurs. Again, internal dissensions in the tribes themselves still further decrease the likelihood of united resistance to our forces. For instance, the Bani Lam are potential enemies of the Shaikh. They never have fought, nor are ever likely to fight, under his banner. The Bakhtiaris, also, are divided into two rival factions. The inhabitants of the towns, though quarrelsome, are not formidable. The Arabs of 'Arabistan.—They are remarkably mobile* whether on foot or on horseback, and are but little hampered by questions of supply. They are fairly well armed, but indifferent shots and poor fighters. The Shaikh of Muham- mareh is paramount in South ’Arabistan, but he has not much power over the tribes west of the Karun whilst he has practically no influence at all over the Arabs of North ’Arabistan. Pro vided that absolute unanimity existed they could put into the field about 30,000 men armed with serviceable rifles. In 1012 and again in 1913 the Shaikh of Muhammareh collected about 5.000 Arabs at Ahwaz, who were w T ell supplied with arms, in cluding a maxim gun. They were intended for use against the Bakhtiaris.The Bakhtiaris. —They are not efficient in a military sense, but are good guerilla fighters at a distance if their retreat is safe. They would be better in defending their own hill country than in operating in the plains of ’Arabistan. Internal dis putes would probably prevent them acting in concert. They have always looked to England for protection and assistance, but would be ready to serve the highest bidder whoever he was. They could put into the field about 5,000 men fairly well armed and another 10,000 armed with most indifferent guns. About half of these would be mounted. The Kuhgalus. —They are disunited by bitter feuds. They resemble the Bakhtiaris in general characteristics, but are a finer race in physique and are better armed. Enmity exists between many of them and the Bakhtiaris. They could, if united, put into the field about 10,000 men mostly armed with Martini-Henry rifles. Their country is very inhospitable and consequently they indulge in much raiding on their neighbours. The Faili Luri. —They are a simple-minded people, wiry and enduring. They are never so pleased as when engaged in a foray. They are said to trust the word of an Englishman, and to dislike and despise the Persians. They are to be found chiefly in Pusht-i-Kuh. The Sagvand and the Dirakvarvd .'—Relations between these two tribes and the Faili Lurs are good. In days gone by there have been frequent quarrels with the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, but they seem to have forgotten these and to look upon the Wall as their protector. In 1912 the Lurs were very unfriendly over the survey operations for the Muhammareh-Khurramabad Railway. The Faili Lurs and the Sagvand and Dirakvand could, if united, put into the field about 20,000 armed men. Arms come into the country from Baghdad. Most Lurs come down to the low country round Dizful in the winter. The Bairanvand is a turbulent tribe living between Khur- ramabad and Burujird and therefore rather remote. Whilst it is impossible to foretell what the attitude of the tribes will be, yet the following opinion is given as to their probable action. The Arabs of Northern ’Arabistan and those west of the Karun might conceivably refuse to side with the Shaikh and us. S2i2(w)GSBtl 90 The well known propensities of the Lurs, Bakhtiaris and the Kuhgalus for guerilla ware fare render them averse from committing themselves far out on the plains of Southern ’Arab- istan. It is unlikely that they would make common cause with the Arabs of North ’Arabistan in opposing our advance. The mutual distrust that exists makes it probable that each will concentrate for the protection of their respective homes. It seems then, that an advance on Shushtar and Dizful would be opposed by Arabs of North ’Arabistan, perhaps assisted by some Lurs and Bakhtiaris, whilst an advance in the direction of Ram Hormuz might expect to encounter resistance from Arabs of North ’Arabistan, perhaps supported by a few Kuhgalus. The probable action of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh must also be considered. He is strong and influential, even in the nemh- bourhood of Dizful, and could exercise considerable control over the Sagvand and the Dirakvand. In the past, he has expressed a desire to ally his interests with those of the British. Under the circumstances, it should not be difficult to sect re his neu trality if not his co-operation, especially if he saw that his friend and ally, the Shaikh of Muhammareh, was on our side. He is reported to be negotiating with the Turks. In 1910 an alliance was formed between the Shaikh of Muhammareh, some of the Haji Ilkhani branch o[ the Bakhtiaris Nizam-us-Sultaneh, the Wctli of Pushti-Kuh and Saulat-ud- Dauleh, Qashqai. The object of the league was to protect the members against the Bakhtiari Government. In 1914 the alliance was canfirmed. The defences of Muhammareh are hardly worth considering • they consist of 5 miscellaneous brass pieces at the eastern end of the town overlooking the river, and a ruined mud wall on the landward side of the town. In 1859 the Persiaas had erected 4 well-constructed batteries on the mainland, and 5 of ’Abbadan Island opposite the town. These had casemates and embrasures. There are 11 old guns in front of the Shaikh’s palace at Failiyeh, but only two of these are fit even for saluting purposes. Camping grounds. Muhammareh .—Unlimited space is available on either side of the Karun above the Bahmanshir channel, with good water from the Karun.A good camp site could be obtained on ’Abbadan Island. Connection with the mainland is, however, difficult, as it entails fording or ferrying across the Shatt-al-’Arab or Bahmanshir canal. One object of camping on 'Abbadan Island would be to obtain the use of the Oil Company’s jetty, for disembarking from ships and re-embarking on river steamers. There is also ample space available north or north-west of Muhammareh. Basrah .—Turkish troops are often camped on the side of Basrah furthest from the river, where the Zubair track leaves the town. This is above flood level. It is 2 miles away from the river water-supply, but water could be obtained from an adja cent creek. There is room for a brigade to camp behind the naval hospital on the left bank opposite the Consulate. This is only 500 yards from the river. Behind this again .'.bout 400 yards further away from the river the space is unlimited. A battalion cou d be encamped at the customs house and there is room for another half battalion on the opposite side of the ’Ashar Creek in the arsenal grounds. Bandar Ma , shur .—No details are available. The country to the north of Bandar Ma’shur is, however, a saline plain, with patches of grass, and camping space is probably unlimited. Umm Qasr .—There is sufficient Space at Umm Qasr for the camp of at least one brigade. The soil is hard sand, with small tufts of grass.CHAPTER VI. MARITIME. Turkish naval strength. The only Turkish warship of any importance on the Tigris is the “ Marmaris ”, a gunboat of about 420 tons. She was completed in 1907 and is armed with four 9-prs., two 1-prs., and a torpedo tube above water. In April 1914 four patrol boats, one of wood and three of iron, of a gross tonnage of 30 to 33 tons each, were landed at Basrah by the S.S. “ Sistan They were made by Thomeycroft and Co., and fitted with two paraffin oil motors of 140 horse power. Each boat carried two 37-m.m. guns, and cost about £45,000. 4,000,000 rounds of common point fuse shell, mark II, fused for the 37'-m.m. guns were also sent. Other vessels of various types are owned by the Turks, but are in v arious stages of disrepair. These are as follows (i) “ Baghdadi ”, converted cargo steamer. Draught 3f feet, one gun, 8 knots speed. Carries 81 to 100 men. Used to transport, troops between the various ports an the banks of the river. ii) “ Alous ”, draught 31 feet. Two guns. Carries 1 60 to 80 men. Speed 6 knots. Used to overawe the Arabs and collect subsidies. Hi) “■ Kilid-el-Bahr ”, an ancient gunboat, formerly per manently located at Basrah. Four guns. (iv) and(v)“Frat” and “Resafa” steamers protected with iron plates probably against attack by the Muntafik on the river. To carry two ordinary guns and two machine guns. These are on the Euphrates. vi) and (vii) “ Birin ji ” and “ Ikinji ”, launches, to be armed with 2 Q. F. guns (1910). No information has been received that this has been done. These are on the Euphrates. River Navigation Craft. The following information is mostly dated 1911. The distribution of river craft in January 1915 is given on page 97. ( 92 )Lynch and Company have three steamers and a Turkish Company had eight steamers for service between Baghdad and Basrah. (See page 95.) As regards other craft, there are no tugs, but there are four steam lighters employed in taking cargo to ships across the bar at Bao. Ocean-going steamers take half cargoes at Basrah, cross the bar and fill up from these lighters outside. These four lighters belong to— Bucknall Steam Navigation Company. Strick Steam Navigation Company. West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company. Bombay-Persia Steam Navigation Company. Another has been ordered by a Parsi firm. Gray, Mackenzie and Company have one launch, and Strick and Company have another. Three or four others have been seen, but are apparently not in use. The types of boats are— (i) A fight keel-less boat called a ballam, 35 to 40 feet long and 30 inches broad. Drawing about 6 inches of water. Capacity, 15 men fully equipped. They are used as punts along the bank, but are towed across the river. Crew two men, who always prefer poling to rowing. (it) Lighters for cargo. Capacity, 20 to 30 tons. Native built. Ample supply. (tit) Native built baghalahs of all sizes. . Ample supply. Lynch and Company have engineering works and a dock for their river steamers under the charge of an English engineer at Magil, about six miles up the right bank of the river. Steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates. There are three English steamers belonging to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch Bro thers), for use on the Tigris, but they are not permitted to ascend beyond Baghdad. The names of the stekmers are the “ Khalifa, ” “ Medjidie ”, and the “ Julnar ”,94 The details of construction of the first two are as follows; — Length of hull .. .. 210 feet. Breadth .. .. .. 34 feet 4 inches. Depth .. .. .. 5 feet 5 inches. Cross tonnage .. .. 470 tons. Registered .. .. .. 390-01. Engines, 1. H. P. .. .. 300. „ N. H. P. .. .. 100. Built in 1880. The construction is like that of American river steamers, w-ith wide sponsons and a double passenger deck. There is a steam capstan in the bow, used for hauling when aground on mud banks. Steering can be done also by the paddles, as each is 'worked by separate set of engines. The sponsons 6 leet wide, increase the deck space considerably. With a full cargo in a high river, they draw 4 feet of water, carrying 400 tons. In the low season they are loaded according to the state of the river, and draw about 3|- feet. Of recent years the water has wasted so much by canals for irrigation that the average cargo is only 200 tons. The “ Julnar ” is a new twin-screw steamer, having a cargo capacity of 500 tons. The average passage from Baghdad to Basrah is 47 hours, and 78 hours from Basrah to Baghdad, increased to 100 hours in flood time against the current, when the boats can only steam 5 knots. The time taken varies with the state of the river, as some reaches cannot be navigated at night at low water. In flood the steamers can travel day and night. About 700 native passengers can be carried besides the cargo. There are six first-class cabins and a small saloon. The speed is 10 knots, but the average against a 2^-knot stream is 6 knots. There is also an old paddle steamer, “ Blosse Lynch.” The crews are Chaldsean Christians fromTalkaif, near Musal. The steamers coal at’Amarah and Kut-al-Amarah on the way up, but by somewhat reducing the amount of cargo sufficient coal for the w hole trip could bo carried.95 There are four iron lighters belonging to the same Company, which are towed to Baghdad by the steamers. They are also used as depots for cargo requiring transhipment, and have a capacity of about 130 tons each, and when loaded draw the same as the steamers. The following is an average time table throughout the year of one of Lynch's steamer? between Baghdad and Basrah: — Stations. tip stream. Down stream. Basrah Hours. Mins.

In addition to the vessels owned by the Lynch Company, a Turkish Company, the Idarah Nahri vah, also owns steam boats on the Tigris. This Turkish Company was reconstituted sore years ago and subsequently in 1908 the “ Grand Baghdad,” the first of96 the presents boats owned by them, was placed on the river This was followed by the ‘ ‘ Basra ’ ’ and eventually by six more, “ Hamidie,” “ Bourhanie,” “Mosul,” “Euphrates,” “ Ressafa,” and “Baghdadi.” Thus making a flotilla of eight vessels. The dimensions of these steamers are :—Length, 240 feet ; breadth, 33 feet; height 6 feet 8 inches. Full draught when loaded, 4 feet 6 inches ; speed, 12 knots. There are, bes'des the above, four barges of the same draught for towing. Length 180 feet and breadth 25 feet. The following additional craft have recently been supplied by Messrs. Thorneycroft:—■ (а) Stern-wheel steamer. Length, 120 feet; speed, 10 knots ; for passenger traffic. (б) Three motor boats. Length, 70 feet ; beam, 9| r eet ; draught, 3 feet; speed, 12 knots. Intended for pas senger traffic (50 passengers), but also to carry a load of 3J tons. In 1909 a proposal was set on foot to amalgamate the two companies but local opposition was encountered, and the project fell through for the time being. They were amalgamated in 1914 under the name “ Mackay Lynch &amp; Coy.” Two tugs which arrived at Basrah in March, 1910, for work in connection with the irrigation projects, were appropriated by the !atp Wall for ordinary passenger service, but were subsequen tly returned to their owners. Sailing boats and small craft. —Bailing vessels on the Tigris below Baghdad are of 30 tons burthen,' drawing about 5 feet when fully loaded; they have one b rge lateen” sail, and a clumsy rudder of great length; in adverse winds they are towed by a lope attached to the top of the mast, the crew tracking along the shore. They would be useful for the construction of boat bridges. In the low season, in shallow ieaches, it is sometimes necessary to unload the cargo, haul the vessel over th.3 obstruction, and load up again. They ascend the river to Sumatra, which is the highest point they reach, and also navi gate the Euphrates, and the Hai canal. Their chief cargo is com. 697 A qufjak is the circular boat used on the Tigris, 8 to 10 feet diameter, made of pomegranate branches woven together with rope and plastered on the outside with bitumen. The construc tion is simple and dates from very early times. They are of various izes, some holding as many as 20 men, while horses, sheep an . cattle are accustomed to cross in them. One or two paddles are used. They are found on the Tigris principally, from Baghdad to ’Amarah, and on the Diyalah up to Ba’qubah. Ihey carry a considerable amount of cargo for their size, and despite their shape, are very serviceable, being difficult to overturn. Below ’Amarah, the Marsh Arabs use a long narrow boat called a “ bedlam ”, propelled by a paddle and one long oar. These boats re quicker than but have not the capacity of the Baghdad quffah. As far as was known up to January 8th, 1915, the following was the distribution of steamers on the rivers :—■ In Turkish hands :— Pioneer. Samara. Bulbul. Launches Ishtar.'S Aziza. &gt; One of the three was sunk in January 1915, Sebah. ) 2 steam barges, 12 barges.* * Maximum capacity— 6 of 150 tons. 4 of 190 tona.- 2 of 290 tors.

Plying between Muhammareh and Ahwaz ( Band-i-Nasiri).101 Tigris Navigation. Above Baghdad navigation of the Tigris is usually only by rafts, though small steamers can go up to Samarra; below Baghdad steamers and sailing vessels are used. Of late years the navigation has been getting increasingly difficult owing to neglect of dredging operations, the want of supervision over the local Arabs, who cut channels and primitive canals in various unscientific ways, thereby causing the river to silt up or open into broad shallows at embarrassing places, and to the insufficiency of steamer traffic which would help largely to keep open the existing channels. Between Kut-al-Amarah and Baghdad all steamers stick frequently at times when the river is low and have to be haul- ; ed laboriously through shallow and winding channels, by means of anchors and winches. About the middle of November, sooner or later, according to the season, rain causes the first rise in the river, and navigation improves. In January, February and March, rain keeps the river fairly lull, although the frost in the mountains may lower it. In March, the snows up country begin to melt and the river to rise, as much as 3 feet being recorded on one occasion in a single night at Baghdad. In April and May the river is at its highest. In July and August it falls gradually, because the melting of the snows on the higher ranges keeps up a fairly constant supply of water. In August, September and October, the river is at its lowest but, in the last two months navigation is easier owing to the channels having become formed and known. The current in the low season is slight, and in flood the •swiftest is about 4 miles an hour in the open reaches of the middle river. Sudden freshets come down while the river is rising, but do not continue long or cause much difficulty to the navigation. Speaking generally, vessels which draw more than 4 to 5 feet of water cannot ascend the river above Qurnah, except when it is in flood. Between Qurnah and ’Amarah is the most difficult stretch of the river for navigation. At Qurnah there is con-w 102 siderable depth of water, and any vessel which can cross the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-ud-’Arab {see page 14) can ascend to Qurnah. The following is a description of the river in detail, by sec tions Baghdad to Kut-al-Amamh .—-Between Baghdad and Kut the distance by water is 215 miles, though the distance by land, neglecting the sinuosities of the river, is only 103 miles. Bagh dad stands at 115 feet above mean sea level, while the level of Kut is 56 feet. In this reach of the river navigation at low water is impeded owing to the existence of shoals, but is practically uninterrupted. The width of the river may be taken as 380 yards, with a depth of 26 feet in flood, diminishing to 64 feet in low supply. The velocity in flood is 4 miles, and in low supply 14 miles, per hour. At Kut the Hai branch, itself the ancient Tigris, leaves the right bank of the river. Kut-al-Amarah to 'Amcvrah .—Between Kut and 'Amarah the distance by river is 153 miles, as against a direct land route of 120 miles. The fall in the level of the land is 28 feet, Kut being 56 feet and 'Amarah 28 feet above mean sea level. In this reach navigation is easy all the year round. The width of the river may be taken as 330 yards, with a depth of 26 feet in flood diminish ing to 6| feet in low supply. In this reach the first of the branches which deprives the Tigris of water in low supply is met with on the right bank above ’Amarah. This branch is known as the Bitara. 'Amarah to Qurnah. —Between ’Amarah and Qurnah the dis tance by river is 90 miles as against 66 miles by the direct land route. The fat! in the level of the country is 18 feet ’Amarah being 28 feet and Qurn .h 10 feet above mean sea level In this r ach the Tigris experiences many vicissitudes, and it is here, that all the difficulties of navigation are to be found. At ’Amarah, on the left bank of the river, the Jahalah (pronounced Ohahaleh) branch leaves the Tigris, with its bed about 6-4 feet lower than that of the Tigris itself. The width of the river averages 197 yards, with a depth of 13 feet in flood, diminishing to 6£ feet in low supply. A short distance down stream from ’Amarah on the right bank the Majar Kabir leaves the Tigris. Immediately below it on the left bank the Machaira branch takes off. Both these branches103 have their beds lower than that of the Tigris, and with the Jahalah, they constitute a distinct menace to the existence of the Tigris, as a river. In the reach below Qal at Salih, after all those branches and overflows have left the river, the Tigris itself is about 66 yards wide, with a depth of 13 feet in high flood, and 6| feet in low supply. In this whole reach navigation is ex'remely difficult at low water. Steamers have to be handled with considerable skill and are delayed again and again. In some years the large steamers have had to suspend their running, the mails being con veyed in launches. This stage of the river continues to near Ezra’s Tomb. Here the waters, which have left the river by various branches, enter it again through the swamps, and the river gradually swells its volume, so that at Qumah it is some 196 yards wide, with a depth of 19J feet: the water being nearly free of deposit and of a dark transparent colour and marsh}’ odour. The effect of the contrary current due to the tide from the Persian Gulf is felt up to Qum .h though the tide helps to swell the river to near Ezra’s Tomb. Qurnah to Basrah .—Between Qurn ffi and Basrah, on a length of 47 miles, the river is from 270 yards to 600 yards wide, with a depth of 26 to 46 feet. In ancient days Qurnah was the point of junction of the Euphrates and Tigris, but now it is Gurmat ’Ali. A little Tigris water may occasionally travel up to the Euphrates from Qurnah, but no Euphrates water reaches that place. A little below Qurnah, on the left bank, the Shatt-as-Suwaib, which brings in the waters of the Karkheh and the marshes, joins the river which, though known from Qurnah to Eao as the Shatt* ah’Arab is, till Gurmat ’Ali is reached, in reality the Tigris alone. A Short distance above Basrah, on the right bank, the Euphrates flows into the Tigris at Gurmat ’Ali. Where the two rivers meet, the Tigris may be taken as 416 yards wide and 33 feet deep, and the Euphrates as 207 yards wide and 80 feet deep. The water of the Euphrates at this point has no deposit, and presents an opaque and wholesome look, in marked contrast to the dark marshy watei; of the Tigris. Immediately below the junction the river increases to a width of 600 yards, with a depth of 60 feet. Basrah is 8 feet above mean sea level, and the extreme difference between high and low water, as affected by the tide104 fwl by the discharge of the river itself is about 10 feet, extreme' hig i water being about 8 feet above mean sea, and low wader minus 1^ feet. For full report of the journey between Baghdad and Basrah and the country on either side adjacent to the river, .see page 136. Navigation of tributary streams. The Diyalah is navigated by Tigris sailing craft as far as Ba'qubah about 50 miles above its junction with the Tigris; steamers might also ascend to this point, but, above this, the river becomes shallow, with a wide gravelly channel, and is not navigable. TheShatt-al-Hai is a branchof the Tigris, leaving that river at Kut-al-Amarah and joining the Euphrates near Suq-ash- Shuyukh ; it is navigable from February to June and is used by native craft for the export of corn grown in the rich district through which it passes. These boats average 80 tons burthen and draw 5 feet of water. At other seasons the Shatt-al-Hai is not navigable, and from July to November the bed is in many places dry. There are no bridges over the stream. Euphrates navigation. Although, as stated, the river is little used for navigation at the present time, it appears from recent reports that a good deal could be done in this respect even in the existing state of the river. The position would be materially improved if the irrigation pro jects proposed by Sir William Wilcocks are carried out, for it must be remembered that Sir William’s proposals include schemes in connection with regulating and distributing the water, not only of the Tigris, but also of the Euphrates, in fact the work suggested touches the question of the Euphrates just as much as that of the Tigris. Some years ago, in 1903, Mr. Dobbs* was of opinion that th e navigation of the Euphrates, except for sailing vessels, wa» impossible below Musaiyib, and that in any case the river was useless for the transport of troops from the Gulf northwards to Baghdad. • On the other hand Sir W. Wilcocks reported in 1905t that the Euphrates was navigable throughout the year from Qurnah to 1903* RePOrfcb ' r Mr ' Dobbs ’ LaS- ’ on the Navigation of the Euphrates, January fThe Irrigation of Mesopotamia, 1905.105 Samawah and up the Hind yah “ canal” to the Hindiyah barrage^ near Musaiyib, for boats drawing about 3 feet of water. From the barrage to Falluj ah, navigation was also open all the year round to ordinary native boats drawing 4 feet. This opinion was generally confirmed in April, 1909, by Lieu* tenant-Colonel Ramsay, the British Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, who undertook a journey by steamer on the Euphrates in that year from the Hindtyah barrage to Qurnah. Officials in the employ of Messrs. Lynch also performed similar journeys in December, 1908, and May, 1909. Their investigations showed that navigation was practicable for shallow-draught steamers (3 to 4 feet draught) during the months stated, which, however, as in the case of Lieutenant-Colonel Ramsay’s journey, coincide with the period during which the river is normally at its highest. It is not clear that, without irrigation improvements, navigation would be practicable during the low-water season. It must be noticed, further that in the two preceding opinions the so-called Hindiyah “ canal ” is utilized; this extends from just south of Musaiyib to Samawah and is held by many to have been originally the true course of the Euphrates. The following account of the course of the river is taken generally from the reports by Sir W. Willcocks and Lieutenant- Colonel Ramsay. From Falluj ah to Musaiyib, a distance of some 56 miles, the average width of the river is 270 yards. The trough of the Euphrates is 10 feet deep, down to the level of low supply, and a flood of 1H feet puts the country under 1 h feet of water, against which it is protected by somewhat ineffective dykes. The depth at low water (autumn) in this stretch is 6| feet and in flood (spring) is 18 feet: velocity of stream (January), 3 feet per second. At Musaiyib is a dangerous curve which needs heavy protective works. Below Musaiyib is the head of the Hindiyah “canal (See Hindiyah Barrage, page 36.) From Hindiyah to Kill, both banks of the canal are cultivated with water-lifts, and also by some minor canals. Hindiyah is a prosperous place, and the point of debarkation for Karbala. It contains large quantities of rice and numerous sailing craft. Kiii is a small place. S212(w)GSB106 A short distance below Kifl the canal divides into two, the right branch, now -silting up, goes to Kufah, from which'place Nkjaf dfaws its water-supply. The other branch which is the' bfet to follow goes to Hamidiyah, a prosperous place with'a boat bridge. Twenty miles below Hamidiyah is the Village of Khazam and 4 miles below this the lake of Shinafiyah is entered with a depth of over 3 feet. Nine hours’ steaming at 5 to 6 milqs an hour between high banks is taken to reach Samawah from the end of the lake. At Samawah the course of the ‘ 4 Euphrates, ’ ’ as distinguish- •ed from the canal, Joins the ” canal ** fioin where ‘It brandies off below Musalyib'. As before remarked; \vhethef or hot this or the carial'is tlie original coiifse of the river iAa matter of‘doubt, bu't in any case the' “ river ” ' stfetch is ' impracticable for navigation ht the^pfes'ent time, being dVy* for 2^ months in the : year, ahd having quite an insignificant width at the end of tlie reach.' ‘ ’ : ro From Samawah to Suq-ash-Shuyukh the length is 120 miles.

The channel (Saffa) to Madinah, leading from 2 or 3 miles above 'Suq-kSh-Shuyukh, passes through -the lake of Hamar, arid emerging from there, it runs through swamps with thick reeds ori each side. The Hamar Lake is very shallow. From Madinah to Qarnah, where the Tigris is joined, there is a deep channel, the swamps continuing on both sided The real course of the Euphrates is said by some to be the water channel which runs from Madinah on the edge of the “ Khor ” or open water to Gurmat ’Ali, 10 miles above Basrah and there connects with the Tigris, but the navigation by this route is through extremely difficult and complicated reaches, practicable only for the smaller natiVe boats. ' 1 1 For navigation of Shatt-al-’Arab see pages 13 and 103. NAVIGATION IN ’ARABISTAN. Steamers of 2' 6' draft run up the Karun to within 7 miles Shushtar, and up the Ab-i-Diz to within 14 miles of DizfulUallams carrying 5 ions can be towed up the Jarrahi river to Khalafabad, and up the Hindiyan river to Deh Mulla. See Chapter VIII, page 119. Landing Facilities. i, Basrah. Basrah is 67 miles from the sea. Anchorage for steamers in mid-stream. Not room for more than 2 abreast but any number pan lie up and down the river Shatt-al-’Arab which is here 600 yards wide. r Landing .—The county round Basrah is quite flat every where. Airy military landing could.,easily be covered, by the fire of ships stationed in the river. The deep muddy creeks in tlie vicinity would, however, greatly impede thp movement of troops. Troops could land anywhere on either bank of the river, without special arrangements being made. From the river to the main quarter of the town. 2 miles, there is only one made road, along the southern bank of the ’Ashar creek. The other tracks are almost impassable in wet weather. _ r , . Wharves .—The office and yard of Cray, Mackenzie and Company, is situated close to the mouth of the ’Ashar creek on the south side. There is a wharf on the river front, made of brick, 80 yards long. - There is a shed close to the wharf, 50 yards long by 10 yards wide,- with open sides and a tiled roof. Height of wharf above water at high tide is about 2 feet. Stores could .be landed here. The best wharf, which has a well built iron shed, is at the late German Consulate a quarter of a.mile below the former British Consulate,. This is also at the. late depot of the Baghdad Bailway at Magil, a wharf provided with steam cranes and several iron sheds. Wharves .could be. easily constpuc^ed, of date-logs of which there is an abundant supply. River front of Lynch and Com pany’s premises is-about 150 yards with an iron shed. Horses are shipped from fighters. About half a mile south of the ’Ashar creek,.there, is another yard with a shed about 60 yards by 15 yards with open sides and matting roof. There are no store depots. Besides the sheds noted above* the bottom storeys of the European houses along the river frontcould be utilized. These houses are two-storied and of brick. There is no stone in the country. Harbour authorities and ?n7o^.—The British India Steam Navigation Company has three regular pilots, Arabs, who know the nver well. They were formerly nakhudas of laghalahs. Ihe Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have also two pilots. Ihe quartermasters of the river steamers would also be able to pilot steamers up the river. There are many Arabs who are constantly going up and down the river in oaghalahs and would prove useful in bringing steamers up the Shatt-al-’Arab. Muhammar'eh.

Anchorage.- —•Steamers could anchor in the channel of the Shatt-al-’Arab inside the bar, which is about j mile below bao fort (see pages 14 and 15). There is no anchorage other than the Shatt-al-’Arab suitable for effecting a landing near tao. Landing. —At high tide landing by boats is not difficult at many places along the bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab, and one or more of the numerous creeks might also be utilised. At low tide banks of mud are uncovered varying from 20 to 100 yards in breadth, and disembarkation would be difficult. Near the fort there is a small pier for landing material. At the civil station of Fao, which is about 4 miles above the fort, there is a rough stone jetty with water deep enough at the end of it for native dhows or ship’s boats. In case troops had to land over mud or were obliged to cross any creeks after landing, it would be advisable to have a supply of 20'’ planks or other bridging material. Date palms might be utilised.

Kuwait Bay. Anchorages. The whole bay affords a good anchorage for iffSbm^s 1 l 6nt h ° ]ding g roun d. Soundings are: 14 fathoms off Ras-al-Ardh, 6 to 10 fathoms off Ras-al-’Aiuzah shoahng to 6 and 7 fathoms at the entrance of DohatKadhamah'. Starting from Ras-al-Ardh, the coast-line forms a bay with shallow water as tar as RarthWiteah, alow p„l»t 6 mihfto aaIll north-westward. Native boats anchor 2 miles to the south east of this point, in shelter from the shamal. The approach to the entrance to the bay, though it lies through shoals and low-lying sandbanks, is not difficult. The harbour is buoyed and light is shown on the British Agency flagstaff. There is a beacon on the Ras-al Ardh. The anchorage for large ships off the town of Kuwait lies 1] or 1 | miles off the north end of the town, and west-north-west of it, in from to 4 fathoms. From Ras-al- ’Ajuzah the coast runs 9 miles south-west by west to the bottom of a shallow bay called ,Dohat Abu Tali. At the entrance of this small.bfty there is a little barren islet, Jazirat. Qurain, about ^.mile from the shore. South-east ^f this is a , small basin with 2 fathoms of water, in which the smaller native boats lie, quite sheltered from all winds. Between' Qqrain Isfetad and thb eastetff ihainland is the B’i’ndar Shuwaikh check, with a good depth of water. Dohat Kadhamah is the name of the bay west of Ras Ashairi). -It shoals gi-aduatly from 7 fathoms at the entrance,' which is 4 miles wide.' ’ (This part of Kuwait Bay, until recently, was very imperfectly surveyed, especially with respect to Ras Kadhamah.) - . Wlf n-; Ras Kadhamah is a low swampy point only just abpve high water, running out some 3 furlongs from the northern shore of the bay. It is partially protected by a bank of sand, naturally formed, along high water line. About mile inland from the point, as also all along this coast-line, the shore is sandy, and covered with tussocks of coarse grass, gradually rising to the foot of the Zor hills which are about 200 feet high. There, is good holding ground .everywhere in Kuwait Bay, but the best anchorage is undoubtedly in Kadhamah because it is the most sheltered. There appears no reason to doubt that this anchorage cciuld easily be cbnverted into ah excellent harbour for sea-going ships by a certain amotmt of dredging and the con struction of jetties and moles. See also page 37.CHAPTER VII. administration. General .—For purposes of government the locality is divided into two imlayals. those of Baghdad and Basrah. In the Turkish system of administration, territory is devided into wilayats, these being again divided into sanjaqs, the sanjaqs into qadhas, and the qadhas into nahiyahs. At the head of the wilayat is the wali (either a military man or a civilian, or both combined), at the head of a sanjaq is a muta- earif, at the head of a qadhd a qaim-maqam, and at the head of a nahiyah a mudit. The wilayat of Baghdad is divided into three sanjaqs, Bagh* dad, Diwaniyah and Karbala. South of a line through Kut-al- Amarah and Samawah commences the Basrah wilayat divided into four sanjaqs, i.e., Basrah, Muntafik, ’Amarah and Al Hasa. There is no definite line west between the limits of the Basrah wilayat and the independent tribes of the Arabian tableland ; and the Al Hasa district on the western shores of the Persian Gulf is separated from the remainder of the Basrah wilayat by the ter ritory of the Shaikh of Kuwait and in 1913 virtually ceased to be under Turkey. The population of the whole of the Baghdad and Basrah wilayats is estimated at an approximate number of 1,047,000, or about 9 or 10 to the square mile. The Basrah wilayat .—The wilayat was administered by a wali, headquarters at Basrah. In the Basrah wilayat the sanjaqs of Basrah and Muntafik were divided into qadhas as follows :— Basrah sanjaq. Mvntafik sanjaq. Qumah. Hai. Basrah. Nasiriyah. Fao. Shatrat-ul-Muntafik. Suq-ash-Shuyukh. The Basrah qadha, being the headquarter, qadha was adminis tered personally by the wali of Basrah ( 112 )113 vided vided , t ie mm muta- tad of lagi- t-al- ided asa, rah and If is ter* sed nh 0, a fik The following were the nahiyahs of the Basrah qadha :— Basrah town. Zubair town. Harthah (north of Basrah). ’Abdul Khasib (Basrah to Za’n). Shatt-al-’Arab (left bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab to Persian territory). The Fao q/idh r i was small, and was believed not to be sub divided into nahiyahs. At Basrah His Majesty’s Government was represented by a Consul and at Baghdad by a Consul-General, who was also Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. ’ARABISTAN. Persian territory met the Shatt-al-’Arab nahiyah of the Basrah qadha on the left bank of the river Shatt-al-’Arab. This part of the Turco-Persian border was demarcated early in 1914, and the boundary follows the Shatt-al-’Arab as far as the upper entrance of the Di'aiji creek, 61- miles by river above the mouth of the Karun, the island of Umm-ul-Khasif and Shamshamiyah being upon the Turkish side, and thence leaves the bank of the river Shatt-al-’Arab in a north-westerly direction towards Hawizeh. The whole province of ’Arabistan is nominally under the Persian Government. The seat of Government is Shushtar, but of late years, the Governor-Generals have spent most of their time at Dizful, owing to their unpopularity at Shushtar, where there is great rivalry between the Shaikh and the Bakhtiaris with regard to predominance. The Shaikh of Muhammareh is almost independent of the Persian Governor-General at Shushtar, and controls all the Arab tribes of ’Arabistan. The districts of Fallahiyeh, darrahi, Ma’shur, and Hindiyan are under tribal chieftains, who are also responsible to the Shaikh for good gov ernment. Ahwaz is managed through a Deputy Governor with head quarters at Bandar Nasiri. He only acts under the Shaikh’s orders, and has but little power. Muhammareh is managed through the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who is practically the head of the police. In most matters S 212 (W)GSB114' however, the government of the Shaikh is personal and extreme ly stringent. Apart from the towns, the chief factors in administration and politics seem to be the different tribal divisions. (1) The Al Kathir, with the Sagwand, administer the coun try west, south-west and north-west of Dizful. They are ruled by two chiefs, both of whom are recognised by the Persian Government. The control of the country and the tribesmen and the collection of revenues is left entirely in their hands. ( 2 ) The Sagvand move about from place to place in Luris- tan. They pay an annual tribute to the Shah, and their relations with the Faili Lurs appear to be good • but they are under no control except that of their chiefs which is not very close. (3) The Diralcvand of Luristan have a wholesome resneet oTT E. of Pusht ' i - Kuh ’ “ nd ( 4 ) The Kuhgalus are for the most part nominally under the Governor of Behbehan, who is under the Bakhtiari Ilkham. Each division has its own chiefs who are re sponsible for the annual tribute. So long as they pay tribute and live peaceably, their internal government is not interfered with ; but they are usually in revolt against any authority trying to collect revenue. (o) The Lurs of Pusht-i-Kuh or Faili Lurs.—The Wali of Pusht-nKuh is the hereditary ruler and representative of the Persian Government. Amongst his subjects he is the supreme power on earth. Between him and his people intervene two classes of agents. (a) His administrators, amongst whom are a few of his relations, to whom he entrusts the control of districts ' and tribes. (b) The Kadkhudas or headmen of tribal sections. (6) ^^^-The two chief families are the Ilkhani , . h . e Ilkhani. Neither party can carry on the administration single-handed and the custom approved of both by the Bakhtiaris and the Persian Government is to appoint the Ilkhani from one family and theIlbegi from the other. Their notorious jealousies and want of unanimity are detrimental to thp efficiency of their administration, as discord causes the personal allegiance of their subjects to be unreliable. Such dis cord affords opportunities for interference by the Persian Government, and for hostile intrigue from outside. There is a British Consul at Muhammareh, and a Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, who deals with the Bakhtiaris, and moves to Isfahan in the summer. The hereditary Shaikh of Muhammareh is a personage of some importance, as he is the ruler over the whole of the southern portion of the Persian province of ’Arabistan, and, though nominally subject to the Government of Tehran, he is in great measure independent of the Persian Central authority. Thus, although he pays a certain tribute in return for the freedom of administrative rights, and while there is a Persian customs official at Muhammareh, the latter is only there by agreement with the Shaikh. As regards relations with Persia, in addition to the customs officials at Muhammareh, Ma'shur, and Hindiyan, there are Persian post and telegraph offices ; there is a Persian Foreign Office representative at Muhammareh. There is a British post office attached to the Consulate. Eastern shores of the Gulf. The whole of the eastern shores of the Gulf are Persian terri tory. Around Muhammareh and down to the shores of the Gulf proper, is the locality known as Southern ’Arabistan ; continuing south to the Gulf of ’Oman are what are known as the Persian Coast Districts, the last of which adjoins Persian Makran lying on the Gulf of ’Oman and outside the Persian Gulf. The coast “ districts ” of the Persian Gulf proper contain the ports of Bushire, Lingeh and Ban far ‘Abbas, the only places v/here the administration is carried out by Persian officials under direct control of the Central Persian Government. In the other localities, the government is farmed out in different degrees to local or other chiefs.116 The British Indian Government maintains at Bushire a Resi dent, who is known as the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf He has a numerous staff, with an armed guard of sepoys at the Residency, and under him are Consuls at Muhammareh, Lingo h hwaz and Bandar ’Abbas. At Bushire, Muhammareh and Bandar Abbas there are British post offices with a hospital at the former place and all quarantine arrangements under British supervision. Practically all the trade at Bushire, Lingeh, and Bandar Abbas is British though several other Powers are repre sented by Consular agents at some of these ports. For Kuwait see page 41. ] 8 gF or measures, weights and currency see Appendix D pageCHAPTER VIII. COMMUNICATIONS. The principal means of communication between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf, through Basrah, is the river Tigris and its continuation the Shatt-al-’Arab. Certain road communications exist, but, especially around Basrah, the numerous water- channels and swamps limit the means of transit by land very considerably. The Euphrates is navigable to a certain extent, but is not generally used for purposes of traffic, and in its present condi tion it is not suitable for military movement of troops except in a subsidiary sense. Existing information relating to the road communications is imperfect, and requires to be supplemented very considerably, but a main connection with Basrah is to be found through Hillah, Diwaniyah, Samawah, Suq-ash-Shuyukh and along the desert edge ; this is probably suitable for wheeled traffic the whole way, but in any case carts can go from Baghdad to Hillah and from Nasiriyah to Basrah. Carriages pass across the desert from Baghdad to Karbala and Najaf, and it is probable that the previously mentioned road can also be reached fairly easily at Samawah from Najaf. Turning to the Tigris side there is a well-used caravan route from Baghdad to Kut-al-Amarah and ’Amarah, but there is little road communication south of ’Amarah as the river marshes then commence. Across the Persian border there are caravan routes from ’Amarah, Kut-al-Amarah, and Baghdad. To Basrah there are caravan routes from Zubair, Umm Qasr and Kuwait, as well as further westwards into Arabia, and the country generally is open and passable for carts. Wheeled transport is little employed in the whole of Meso potamia, camels being principally used, with donkeys for short journeys, and mules in the hilly country to the east. Lines op Advance. To reach Basrah, the following are the possible routes :— A. By river to Basrah. (Theeasiest and quickest route.) B. Disembark at Fao, thence along the edge of the desert parallel to the Shatt-al-’Arab. ( 117 ) General.- 118 &gt; . C. Disembark at Muhammareh, tlieiue by land, alun^ eastern bank of Shatt-al-’Arab. &amp; D. Disembark at Umm Qasr, thence by iand. E. Disembark at or near Kuwait, thence by land. b rom Basrah onwards there are only two main routes towards Baghdad, namely ;— (1) By River Tigris. ( 2 ) By road on the desert side of the River Euphrate?. Roads, General.—The most important northern route leads to Musal through Kifri, Kirkuk and Arbil, across fe.-tile and well-watered country, and is jassable for wheels throughout the crossing of numerous irrigation canals for the first two stages out of Baghdad, and the ferry over the Great Zab, being the chief difficulties. A track leads over the plain and along the light bank of the river to Musal, but for some stages north of Tikrit it is not passable for wheels, and water is scarce as the river bank cannot there be approached. Few supplies are obtainable, except from Bedouins. An easy track, with khans at intervals, leads from Baghdad along the left bank to Samarra, a Persian place of pilgrimage. There is an important route to the north-east leading into Persia by Khaniqinand the Tak-i-Girreh pass up to Kirmanshah. There is a well-used caravan route from ’Amarah and Kut-al Amarah, generally following the left bank of the Tigris and crossing the DiyaJah by a bridge of boats near its junction with main stream. An important route, along which a rough kmd of diligence plies, leads from Baghdad to the celebrated shri nes ot Karbala and Najaf, and another to Hillah and Diwaniyah. From Baghdad westward along the Euphrates to Damascus and Aleppo the route crosses the plain towards a bridge at hallujah over the Euphrates. For river navigation see Chapter VI. Page 92 et seq. For details of Routes see end of this chapter. Page 123. 1 Arabistan. • The P rinci P aI means of communication is by the Karun river. The road communications consist of a caravan routealong the right bank of the river to Dizful, and tracks to Falla- hiyeh. Troops moving up the Katun by land from Muhammareh would follow the right bank until the marshes on the left bank in the Muhammareh district were left behind- The tracks to Fallahiyeh are practicable for transport animals. The Karun River.—The value of the Karun river as an inland w r ater line of communication is somewhat discounted by its tortuous windings, by the rapids just below Ahwaz, W'hich necessitate a break of bulk at Bandar-i-Nasiri, and the fact that specially constructed boats are necessary for its navigation. (The steamboats available are given on page 99.) There would be no difficulty in transporting infantry and supplies up the river to Bandar Nasiri, but the steamers and barges are not suitable for carying animals. Ordinary vessels of 5 ' or 6 ' draft can safely navigate the river as far as Bandar Nasiri, but when the liver is low even vessels of only 3%' draft have difficulty over the 20 miles below that place. The rapids at Bandar Nasiri are passable by towing, but are a serious obstacle even to native boats. Moreover the boats which ply on the lower reaches of the river, are not suitable for working the reaches above Ahwaz. At Bandar Nasiri a tramway, 2,500 yards long, with a gauge of 3', conveys goods from the foot of the rapids to above Ahwaz for re-shipment. There are 6 trollies in use, each drawn by one horse. Above Ahwaz steamers of light draft can be used to sup plement land transport as far as Shalaili. The point of the Karun from which to reach the oil-fields at Maidan - i -Naf tun, is Darreh-i-Khazineh. Troops could cover the distance from Darreh-i-Khazineh to Maidan-i-Naftun in 48 hours. The road is fit for wheeled traffic. They might as an alternative; go along the pipe line from road which leaves the Karun river bank at Band-i-Qir. There is a road all along the pipe line. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company run their motor cars feely between Muhammareh end the oil fields. The Ab-i-Diz is navigable within 14 miles of Dizful. Native craft and rafts are used for transporting grain and supplies from Shushtar and Dizful to Ahwaz.miles of the line Itself had been completed. Great difficulties were being experienced in transporting railway material from Basrah to Baghdad, the German tugs imported for the purpose being most of the time under repair. The alignment for the Basrah-Baghdad Section of the line had been selected, and was that passing through Musaiyib, Karbala and Najaf, and thence along the right bank of the Euphrates to Zubair. The alignment of the Khaniqin branch was being surveyed and it had been practically decided that it should run almost straight from Khaniqin to Sadiyah and join the main line at Samaichah. The German officials seemed very anxious to get this branch line opened before the completion of the Muham- mareh-Khurramabad line and they were expecting orders to start on it daily. It had been estimated by Meissner Pasha, the German Engineer in charge of construction, that through communication from Constantinople to Basrah would be opened by December 1917. On 3rd July 1914 news was received that another section of the Baghdad Railway from Jerablus on the Euphrates to Tal Abiyadh, about 60 miles to the east, w as to be opened on the 1st June 1914. This has since been completed. In November 1914 it was reliably reported that the Bagh dad Railway running north from Baghdad was complete as far as Samarrah, and that it was being used as far as Khan Mashaidiyah for the transport of troops. Basrah had been definitely fixed as the terminus of the Baghdad railway at the Persian Gulf end. Tramu/ii/s, Baghdad. —An electric tramway line has been projected, but not commenced (1911), to the suburb of Mu’adh- dham on the north, and to that of Qararah on the south. A horse tramway, 4 miles in length, runs to Kadhimain, another suburb to the north, on the right bank of the river. This place and Mu’adhdham on the left bank are connected by a boat bridge. Fallujah is now connected with Baghdad by tramway. Projects have been proposed at various times for the estab lishment of a motor service to connect Baghdad with Damascus and Aleppo, but although it was stated in 1911 that a draft concession had been prepared in favour of a French company, the matter was subsequently dropped, and nothing has yet (1915) been done in this connection* S212(w)GSB&gt; 122 Telegraph*. The Indo-European Telegraph Department’s cable (British) from India, vid Bushire, is landed at Fao, where there was a combined Anglo-Turkish telegraph office, British operators being in charge of the caJde terminus. This is now all British. There is a British telegraph office at Basrah and this line is now connected across the river with Muhammareh. A Turkish land line, along the right (western) bank of the Shatt al-’Arab, went from Fao to Basrah, and thence along the bank of the river Tigris to Baghdad. Another line, branching off at Qurnah, follows the Euphrates Valley, vid Hillah to Baghdad. From Baghdad the land line continues, vid Musal to Constantinople. A single branch line strikes off from the Tigris line at Kut-al- Amarah to Hai, and it is proposed to extend this to Nasiriyah, thus giving cross connection between the two main lines. A line with two wires runs from Baghdad north to Musal, and from Baghdad to Kirmanshah and Tehran a line follows the main route through Ba’qubah, Khanaqin and Karind, having two wires on wooden poles. The office in Baghdad is a tumbledown building, and the instruments are badly kept and of inferior workmanship. The condition of the telegraph lines is bad, and a slight atmospheric disturbance causes interruption of service. During the winter it is not uncommon for Baghdad to be cutoff from all communi cation with the rest of the world for several days at a time. A Persian Government land line goes from Muhammareh to Ahwaz, and irom Ahwaz, via Behbehan and Furazjan, to Bushire. The repair and working of this line was handed over to the Indo-European Telegraph Department in 1914. W ireless. There are wireless stations at Basrah, Bushire and Jashk. Telephones. There is an overhead telephone from Maidan-i-Naftun to ’Abbadan island, with a branch to Muhammareh, belonging to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This runs along the pipe line on the left (eastern) bank of the Karun river. The Shaikh’s palace at Failiyeh is connected by telephone with Muhammareh.mmmama ( 125 ) ROUTE No. 1.

General Description.- —An unmade track, ordinarily practic able for wheeled transport all the way to Basrah but consider able spadework would be necessary at the Mutla’ Pass 3 miles north of Jahrah, as well as the spreading of brushwood, or simi lar material to render passable the soft sand just before the pass reached. The shortest of the land routes running between Kuwait and Basrah does not follow the one here described but leads from the Mutla’ Pass direct to Safwan and thereby saves about 5 miles. When the Euphrates rises to any great extent that portion of the route lying between Rafidhlyah, stage 6 , and Basrah, is impassable, being sometimes flooded to a depth of 2 or 3 feet. The highest flood season of the Euphrates is during the month of April. Water. —Limited and only passably good at Kuwait; plentiful at stage 1 ; none at stages 2 and 3 ; limited at 4 ; plen tiful at 5 ; good and abundant at 6 and 7. It will be noted that there is no water at all between Jahrah, stage 1, and Qashaniyah, stage 4, a distance of 47 miles. Water would therefore have to be stored at the two intermediate halting places, which are optional.

There are sheep and goats, a few cattle, 30 to 40 donkeys* and camels belonging to the Bedouins. 4 QASH’ANIYAH—47 m. North-west to mile 3, to gap in the belt of low 67 m. hills which are known as the Jalaz-Zor. This gap is called the Mutla’ Pass, being named from a hill 415 feet high on the east side of it. The hill on the west side is called Mutaili’ah. Through this gap a small valley discharges its drainage into the Jahrah plain ; it is called Jauf-al-Mutla’and has its head near mile 5. A few miles to the west of the Jauf are some hills forming a land mark known as Khashm-al-Tfri. After traversing the pass, and reaching the plateau, the remainder of the route is passable to all vehicles. The route now turns north by east, and runs in a straight line through the tracts of Zaqlah, Qira’al Marru and Yah ; the going is level but stony. At mile 23, the route enters the Batih district, an undulat ing, perfectly waterless desert, lying somewhat high, its ele vation varying from 130 to 210 feet. At mile 26, pass 2 mounds known as Hissu-adh-Dhabi At mile 29, the low-lying tract called Radhatain falls away to the east. The route then crosses over numerous slight ridges, the southerly being known as A1 Abatah, and the northerly being known as Hamar, and passes through the locality of Batih-al- ’Aud. About mile 42, the broad, shallow depression of Sil Jirfan is traversed. The Qash’aniyah wells are 6 in number, and contain good water at 18 feet.

One mile to the west is a Bedouin halting place with wells of fair water at 12 feet. Jabal Sanam stands 5 miles west of the village. 6 RAFIDHIYAH —14 m. General direction, slight- ■ — ly east of north. 91 m. The route runs over flat barren, stony ground, passable for all arms. It skirts the swamps at the head of Khor Zubair, and is above the ordinary flood level. At mile 14, Rafidhiyah. a country residence of the Naqib of Basrah, it is a quadrangular enclosure with bastions at the north and south angles. Water is abundant from 3 wells, 12 feet deep. There are a few trees. There are more wells, and some cultivation, on the north-east side of Rafidhiyah. 7 BASRAH—16 m. General direction north-east by -—-— east. 107 m. The route at first runs north over a plain with a very slight ascent. The soil is gravel ly. There is fair camel-grazing and occasional houses with irrigated gardens. The whole of the country between Rafi dhiyah and mile 6 is plentifully supplied with water from wells 5 to 6 feet deep; they are especially numerous about mile 4. From mile 3 to 6 there is scattered cultivation of rice, maize, lucerne, and dates, the pots being surrounded by tamarisk growth. This tract is called Dirhamiyah, and the population is about 6,000. There are large numbers of buffa loes, cows, and sheep. At mile 8 , site of old Basrah, and 3 miles off the track in a direction south-west by west, is Zubair, a well-built town situated on slightly elevated ground with a ridge of brokenRoute No. 1— concld. ground to the north-west, north, and north-east. Small quantities of supplies, a bazar, no fodder, 4 or 5 wells of good water. In the time of the Euphrates flood a water channel, which approaches the northern end of the town of Zubair, from the direction of Basrah, contains 2 feet of water. The route turns north-east. It then crosses an open barren plain. The soil is light brown, hard, and dusty; it is free from stones. From mile 6 to mile 10 the route runs in a depression which is liable to be submerged by the Euphrates in high water season, to a depth of 2 to 3 feet. At mile 11 the date groves and gardens of Basrah commence. At mile 12, the road enters the town across a small bridge, after which it passes under a built-over tunnel of houses, known as the Bab-al-Kuwait. Thence it emerges into the bazars. The route for wheeled traffic goes through the city and bazar to reach the landing places on the river Shatt-al-’Arab. Animals can make their way through by various paths, as the irrigation channels are bridged for foot-passengers only. Between Zubair and Basrah there is a good, open road, but it is unmetalled.

General description.—k track regularly used by local in habitants on their way to and from Basrah, on footer on horse back, but not for the transport of merchandise, for which purpose the river route is always employed. From Fao telegraph office to Ma’amrah, at mile 6 , there are difficulties, though not serious for wheeled transport, and a rough road would have to be made to give it access to the desert. But for this the road is fit for wheels the whole way, except after wet weather, when for as much as a month at a time it becomes too soft to move carts over it. It may be said to follow the telegraph line closely and to keep within two miles of the river, and within a few hundred yards of the date groves, all the way. It is excellent going in dry weather throughout its whole length. From near the fort at Fao, to Ma’amrah, a new dam has been made to keep out the salt water. Horses can go along the top of this embankment, but wheeled transport would have to keep to the west side of it on desert soil, and this is generally bad going for wheels, as it is at this point a salt mud flat which never dries, and is flooded at high tides. This condi tion, however, ceases above Shaikh Naghaimish’s village in Ma’amrah, 7 nrles up stream from Fao Telegraph Office.

The banks would generally require to be ramped to enable animals to get to the water’s edge, but this would present no difficulty. Near the sea, water should be taken with the falling tide, especially when the river is low. Fud .—A great abundance of date-palm wood. Fodder .—Plenty of short grass inside the date plantations. Lucerne and barley are extensively grown and, in places, rice. Outside tire date plantations there is no grazing, except in spring for sheep. /S'wppZfes.—Large quantities of dates, and a little straw and barley, are obtainable at the hamlets. The best dates are procurable at Durah and Saniyah, stage 1 , the former tract also producing a few grapes, oranges, and figs. Meat is generally abundant, and milk, fairly so.

Above Basrah the banks are low and fringed with date plantations. A few villages, clusters of mud huts, are scattered among the trees, and herds of cattle, sheep, and buffaloes graze along the banks. Much rice is grown between Basrah and Qumah. Qurnah is a place of 700 houses on the west bank of the Tigris, on the actual promontory at the old junction with the Euphrates. There are a few 2-storeyed brick houses on the bank, with gardens and date plantations. It was the seat of a Qaim-Maqam under Basrah. There is a telegraph office; the two lines from Baghdad, one by the Euphrates, and the other by the Tigris, join here. From Basrah to Qurnah are two wires on iron poles.Route No. 4— contd. The date plantations extend some 4 miles above Qurnah, but after that only a few solitary clusters are to be seen until near Baghdad. Above Qurnah begin the great marshes of the Tigris and Euph rates which extend between the rivers, and as far as Hawizeh to the east. In spring the country is under water, with little visible but tall reeds and sedges. The marshes to the east are formed by the overflow of the Karkheh, Tib, and Dawairij rivers from the Pusht-i-Kuh moun tains. One outlet called by Europeans the Hadd, but known locally as the Jahalab (always pronounced Chahalah), runs out of the Tigris just above ’Amarah. Another, the Swaib, the main outlet of the Karkheh, enters the Shatt-al-’Arab 6 miles below Qurnah.

There is a telegraph office, the line being carried across the river on high poles so as to clear the funnels of steamers. In Qal’at Salih are a few gardens of fruit and date trees; high mud walls. The river gradually widens above this, having a belt of wheat and rice cultivation on both banks. At mile 12 above Qal, at Salih the banks get slightly higher. Barley, wheat, maize, millet, sesame, and rice are the chief products. ABU SAIJAN .. .. .. The wheat and barley extend in a strip along both banks.

The population are settled Arabs, with some Persians and Sabians, 20 houses of Christians, and 50 of Jews. The Moslems are chiefly Shi’ahs. The houses are of sun-dried bricks and mud, with some of burnt bricks. A branch of the Tigris, the Chahalah, flows out immediately above the town. It is the centre of a sanjag, and has a barrack for 200 men ; there is always nominally a battalion here. There is a Customs Office and a Telegraph Office. It is a regular stop ping-place for steamers ; they come alongside the wharf, which is faced with brick and is about J a mile long. A small supply of coal is kept here belonging to the Lynch Company. There is a bridge of boats, of 23 light wooden pontoons, covered with bitumen, each 25 feet long and 10 feet broad, with a freeboard of 6 feet. The waterway is 12 feet, and the roadway 20 feet wide, of wood, with fascines covered with clay. ’Amarah is a thriving place, exporting wheat and barley from the country along the Chahalah (Hadd) channel. Between ’Amarah and Dizful, in Persia, there is a certain caravan traffic.Route No. 4— contd. Along the east bank there are a few date plantations and gardens. At mile 15 above Amarah cultivation ceases. At ’Amarah the river is 250 yards wide, and up stream becomes wider, less water losing itself in the marshes. {See page 102 .) •ALI-ASH-SHARQI 42m. | 172£m.

A certain extent of the country round is usually under wheat and barley. Steamers only stop when they have cargo or passengers. The river is 300 to 350 yards wide, and the banks slightly increase in height. At ’Ali-al-Gharbi the river makes a wide eastern bend, and approaches to within 30 miles of the Pusht- i-Kuh range, on the Persian Frontier. KUT-AL-AMARAH 73 m. 283 m. Kut-al-Amarah is 285 miles from Basrah following the windirg of the river, and 220 miles from Baghdad. It is on the east bank, contains about 500 houses of settled Arabs and Lurs, emigrated from Persia, with a row of better houses along the river front. The barracks are a square building at the w r est end. There is a telegraph office connected by a short branch line (2 wires) with the main line, which crosses a loop of the river 6 miles to the east. Occasionally there are Turkish soldiers quartered here, used chiefly for overawing the Bani Lam140 Route No. i—contd. Arabs, who roam over the desert towards the Pusht-i-Kuh. There are, however, no troops there at present (August, 1912). • A small fringe of gardens, irrigated by lifts, or chards, from the river, with a belt of country under barley and wheat, extends on both banks. Kut is a thriving place, and a regular stopping-place of steamers. The district and country alon&lt;* the Gharaf stream produce fair quantities of grain. ca ' ra ' van rou ^ e leads from here through Jasan and Badrah to Mandali, and forms the outlet for the trade of those districts. A difficult hill track leads by Zurbatieh and Deli Bala to Kir- manshah. A caravan route lies across the desert to Baghdad, following the general direction of the Tigris, and crossing the Diyalah at the boat bridge, at its junction with the Tigris. Occasional caravans come from Shushtar and Dizful along the foot of the Pusht-i-Kuh; but the Bani Lam Arabs have made this route insecure. The northern entrance of the Gharaf stream is opposite Kut. It can be navigated by native boats when the water is high m spring. The Tigris at Kut is 400 yards wide, and above it the banks become higher. BGHAILAH. .. 47 m. 330 m.

A khan about 1 mile above the village. CTESIPHON .. 50 470£ to. Enter a long bend, (Taq-i-Kisra) near Ctesiphon, which doubles back almost on itself. The Arch of Ctesiphon, or the Taq-i-Kisra, stands in the chord of the bend, overlooking the ruins of Seleucia on the west bank, and Ctesiphon on the east. It is a good landmark, visible 3 hours off. There was a small gunpowder factory on the west bank, which utilized the saltpetre found in the vicinity, but it is now unused. DIYALAH RIVER .. Pass the mouth of the Diyalah. Several small mud villages of both banks, while the fringe of cultivation on the banks become nearly continuos. There is a boat bridge of 13 pontoons over the Diyalah near the junction of he Baghdad-Kut-al-Amarah route. Below Baghdad, and above the mouth of the Diyaiah, is an island with brushwood and trees ; the banks are lined with date gardens 4 to f mile from the bank, beyond which is an extent of cultivated country.

A sharp bend of the river brings Baghdad , into view, and the Butish Rcs.dency is reached 505 miles from Basrah by river, thou ah much less in a straight line. At Qararah, about 3 miles above the junction of the Diyalah, is a boat bridge of 40 pontoons over the Tigris. Baghdad is the capital of ’Iraq, and is built on both sides of the Tigris ; undefended, but almost surrounded by a raised road, many 3-storeyed houses of brick; 4,000 shops, over 200 khans, and many mosques ; population, about 140,000. Water for drinking purposes is obtained either by means of pipes from the Tigris, or, as is generally the case, from carriers. A large number of houses possess wells, but the water in them is not drinkable. Fuel is abundant, and fodder (for battle, donkeys, mules, camels, etc.) is fairly so, that for horses being indifferent. Supplies consist of rice, wheat, barley, and other cereals ; also fruit and vegetables. Livestock plentiful; domestic birds in considerable numbers. (See also page 30.) ROUTE NO. 5.

The river is crossed bv a boat bridge. There is a baz r ir of some 250 shops, and the place is a much frequented Bedouin market. The neighbourhood is well cultivated, a surplus of cereals, vegetables, and fruit being exported. There are 20,000 date palms, mostly on the south bank, but these are not sufficient for local requirements. Livestock and transport animals, ex cept camels, are owned by the surrounding tribes, but it is impossible to estimate the numbers that might be forthcoming if required. 4 QASR IBN ’ANSAR 30 m.

There is a large caravansarai 100 yards square with walls 19 feet high on the outside ; it would accommodate 400 horses and 300 men. There are the usual open cubicles for sleeping in round the courtyard, and the usual back galleries of stables. Water is from a well { of a mile distant. There are two other Small khans at this place, each of which would hold 50 horses and 20 men. No supplies are obainable except a little chop ped straw. 2 KHAN HAMAD ,. 14 m. South-east by south.

Near Khan Hamad the country is flat and featureless ; in the direction of the Hindiyah it is cultivated to a considerable extent with low-growing crops. Khan Hamad consists of a large walled enclosure, 250 yards long by 100 yards Avide, with 5 caravansarais inside it open ing one into the other. In these are the usual arched cubicles with stables behind them. The outer walls of the enclosures are 18 feet high ; and as there are parapets abox r e the roofs of the stables, the whole could be easily defended against rifle fire. There is accommodation for 500 horses and 1,000 men. Besides the large enclosure there are 2 or 3 small khans and about Note. —Thalul riders and others do this journey in one &lt;dage and travel direct to Najaf without touching at Khan Hamad.

South-south-east, - — (or Khan Mirza) The road is sandy for 36m. some distance after leaving Khan Hamad ; it rrms between the pure desert on the right and low-lying lands, connected with the Hindiyah, on the left; these last are liable to inundation, but have good grazing during the cold season. About 3 miles short of Khan Musalla the going becomes better. Here is a large walled enclosure, containing two caravan- sarais which lead one into the other, Outside are 2 small khans and a few coffee shops ; and about 200 yards to the east wards are some 30 Arab huts. The place would hold 800 horses and 600 men, but there are practically no supplies. Water is obtained from wells and from a canal which comes from the Shatt-al-Hindiyah. 4 NAJAF .. 11 m. South-south-east. From Khan Musalla 47 m. to Najaf the road lies over fine sand and the going is heavy. At mile 11 Najaf, a town of some 30,000 inhabitants, situ ated on a ridge of a reddish Sandstone and gravel. It has walls about 30 feet high with circular bastions every 100 yards some 60 feet in diameter. They are gradually falling to ruin. The water supply of the place is from the Hamidiyah canal, which runs along the base of the ridge. Water for washing is obtained from the Bahr-an-Najaf, but is brackish. There are a few date plantations in the dry part of the Bahr-an-Najaf, near the town. The place is, however, otherwise quite destitute of natural resources, being in the desert. All supplies etc., are imported. There is a large bazar. T. O. P. O. This place is also well known as Mashhad ’Ali. (See also page 29,)151 ROUTE No. 8. 27 miles.

At mile 4, the lake known as the Hor-al-Husai- niyah approaches the right of the road. The water which es capes from this lake at its north western corner is used for irri gation, but it sometimes spreads over the road and spoils it in places. About mile 5 or 6 miles the road skirts the village of Sulaimaniyah upon its southern side ; and beyond this village is a bad slough which in time of flood can only be passed in boats.152 Route No. 7— concld. At mile 10| the Dawaihiyah, and at mile 12 the ’Abd ’Auniyat, (both canals from the Shatt-al-Hindiyah) are passed by fording. From mile 11 the route is very sandy. The single line of tele graph which connects Karbala with Tawairij follows the route described and is carried upon iron posts ; but at the Dawaihiyah and ’Abd ’Auniyat crossings it is slung upon high wooden masts. Tawairii, an important town, standing on both banks of the Hindlyah at 13 miles below its head. The quarter on the left bank consists of mud houses, a few shops, and a good khan, and is connected by a boat bridge of 21 pontoons with main town on the right bank which contains numerous masonry buildings and the public offices. Altogether there are about 150 shops, 3 mosques, and 4 khans. Population, about 4,000 souls. Abun dant water from the Hindiyah.

South-east. ■ - At Tawairij the route 27 m. crosses from the right to the left bank of the Shatt-al Hindiyah by a bridge of 21 boats at the town. The country traversed throughout this stage is flat, rather sandy, and partly cultivated. The track itself is intersected by various canals from the Euphrates, which are wider and deeper as Hillah is approached. Those nearest to the town have frail and narrow bridges, neither strong enough nor wide enough for guns, and without parapet or hand rail. The largest of these canals, the Tajiyah, is crossed at mile 12 ; the enormous accumulations of silt-clearance which line its course make it appear from the distance like a high rail way embankment. From mile 44 the Birs Nimrud, mound and ruins are visible r first to the right front, and then to the front. For Hillah, see Koute No. 9, Baghdad-Hillah, page 165*ROUTE No. 9.

As far as stage 2 the road lies over level clay plains which are generally barren owing to lack of irrigation. In the winter large caravans of camels, and small ones of donkeys, are met with upon this road carry ing wheat and rice to Baghdad. The Baghdad-Hillah line of telegraph, which is a double one, follows the alignment of the road pretty closely as far as stage 2.

Water sometimes collects on either side of this bridge in pools 1 | feet deep, which might possibly be an obstacle to guns but not to cavalry or infantry. From a short distance beyond this bridge to the Kharr bridge at mile 3 the road runs along the top of an embankment revetted with brushwood and pierced at intervals by brick culverts giving passage to floods that cross the line of the road here in wet weather. The top of the embankment is about 15 feet above the surrounding country, and where it leads on to the Kharr bridge it attains its maximum breadth, 45 feet. The ends of the bridge are 2 stone piers, 16 feet broad and fret long, projecting from eithe 1 * bank ; the central portionRoute No, 10— contd. ••«S'rs:s;srESr::£ --fi; the road, Is a 2 -storeyed brick house, behind which are about -0 mud huts. ,, After crossing the Kharr bridge the road trends to the south, separating from^he bridge embankments *hreh eonrinues eve ^ ward for about 2 miles and ends m the desert. Wear mne o The road strikes a bend of the Tigris, but again immediately leaves it. . . At mile 6 , Khan-al-Kharabah, a ruined caravansarai, passed on the east of the road. ^ About mile 10 there is marshy ground, sometimes dry, on both sides of the road. Beyond this as far as Mahmudiyah th country traversed is dry desert. _ At mile 13 there is another deserted caravansarai, Khan Azad, on the west side of the road. As Mahmudiyah is entered the canal °f the same name from the Euphrates is crossed: the canal is here 27 feet broad smdTd feet^deep, and the bridge over it is l^e^ small arch of 6 feet span m the middle. A little hig P canal is only 10 feet broad. Mahmudiyah, an increasing town on the south bank of the canal of the same name, with 150 houses, a dozen^hops U khans, and about 1,000 souls. These khans are mostly d f ible, one of them being partly loopholed and prodded mth circular towers at the four corners; in SS » , ,, would provide accommodation for about 1,000 same number of animals. _ . The canal flows for* 8 or 9 months in the year, and irrigates fields of wheat, barley and millet. At Mahmudiyah there are a few regular soldiers. 2 MUSAIYIB .. 20 m. South-south-west. At mile 5, Khan-Ai- — T. T3ir. a caravansarai 41m. . , now deserted, stands on the west side of the road. some mounted Zaptiahs and158 Route No. 10— cowM. At mile 12, Sikandariyah village, 50 mud houses with a khan and several br ck enclosures, on left bank of canal of same name. Cultivation being developed ; grazing for considerable flocks and herds. Just, beyond here, a canal from the Euphrates is crossed by a brick bridge. Between here and end of stage there is some times an extensive slough, known as Abu Lupah. The road strikes the left bank of the Euphrates immediate^ ly above Mus i yib town; about 50 yards before reaching the bank it crosses a deep canal by a high brick bridge of which the roadway is 10 feet wide. The approach to the town is along a broad embankment carefully revetted, which contains the river at this point. In the middle of Musaiyib town the Euphrates is crossed by a boat bridge of 24 pontoons, a rickety and ill-maintained struc ture. Musaiyib, situated on both sides of the Euphrates, and shut in by palm trees ; main part of town on left bank, but some of the best buildings are on the right bank. Houses mostly of masonry ; there are 12 khans, 25 granaries, and about 100 shops. On the left bank immediately above the town a strong em bankment carefully revetted extends for about 600 yards, on the top of which runs the Baghdad-Karbala road. Population, about 3,500 souls; there are 40,000 date palms ; transport is not readily obtainable in any amount ; forage and provisions limited j boats include about 12 sdfinahs and a score - of sajahs. (See also p. 29.) 3 KARBALA .. 20 m. West-south-west. ' The road for wheeled transport from here to Karbala skirts the northern edge of the cultivation dependent on the Husainiyah canal, at a distance of 2 or 3 miles from the canal; passes the tomb of ’Aun at mile 12 or 13; and finally enters Karbala by the Bab Baghdad bridge. An alternative route, for horsemen and foot passengers, follows more closely the north bank of the Husainiyah. At about mile 7, it crosses a medium sized distributary from the Husainiyah, empty and ruined; and immediately beyond thisRoute No. 10 — concld. it runs over the Wall distributary by a brick bridge, 18 feet wide, with no parapet nor handrail. The banks of the Wall are 45 feet apart, 25 feet high, and precipitous; and the stream at the bottom flows 6 feet wide and 3 feet deep. A short dis tance beyond the Wall the road crosses the Hamudiyah distri butary, which has banks 25 feet apart and 16 feet high. The bridge here is of brick, with an 8 -foot roadway. At about mile 11, another distributary, known as the Abu Sulaiman, narrower than the preceding ones, and spanned by a bridge of wood and earth. About mile 12, Khan-al-’Ataishi. To mile 17, route runs along right bank of the Husaimyah, and a number of small canals are passed, the bridges over which are bad and unfit for wheels. The road now crosses to the left bank of the Husainiyah by the Gul-i-Safid. lor these last several miles the way has lain through dense date planta tions. From mile 17 to end of stage there are continuous walled enclosures adjoining the road on both sides. Karbala is a town of about 50,000 permanent inhabitants and has in addition a large floating population. The old town is surrounded on three sides by a wall from 20 to 30 feet high, with towers at intervals, but the work is in bad repair, ihere are two tiers of loopholes ; perimeter of wall, about 2 mfies ; 5 gates. Large agricultural and garden produce, considerable quantities of dates. Large and well-stocked bazaar, and some 20 shops dealing in European wares. Karbala not a goo centre for collection of supplies or transport. No mules ; and camels only procurable in the autumn when the Bedoums rome in. There is a flour-mill driven by an oil-engine ; 2 ice-making plants. Water from Husainiyah canal, or when it is dry, from 20 to 25 wells sunk mostly in the canal bed. Gam- son* consists of about 240 Turkish soldiers, and there are about 100 Zaptiahs generally present as well. Telegraph Office and Post Office. Karbala is also known as Mashhad Husain.

The chief route from Baghdad to the north is by Dujail, Harbah, and Samarra to Tikrit, 104 miles; while the main route to the north-west passes by Abu Ghuraib, Fallujah, Ruma- diyah, and Hit, and reaches, ’Anah at 216 miles. The Tikrit route follows the Tigris, and the ’Anah route to the Euphrates line. Forty days is about the time taken by a laden caravan to reach the Mediterranean from Baghdad. The old postal route between Damascus and Baghdad lies in an almost direct line across the shol, or desert, and crosses the Euphrates at Fallujah. It is over 500 miles in length, and the journey occupies about 10 days. The camel post now travels vid Aleppo. (c) From Baghdad to Sulimdniyah, via Saldhiyah (or Kifri), 165 miles.

(Reference.— Routes in Persia, Volume III, Routes Nos. 66 and 72.)APPENDIX A. Note on Qatar Peninsula and Dohah. The Qatar Peninsula, to the east of the island of Bahrain, is ruled by Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jasim, a rich and powerful chief, who has a following of about 2,000 lighting men. Some few years ago his father was engaged in hostilities with the Turks, who succeeded, after some hard fighting, in establishing a garrison in the fort of A1 Bida’ (Dohah ) on the eastern side of the' i peninsula and in reducing Jasim to nominal subjection. He is now styled qaim-maqam of the peninsula under.the Porte, and flies the Turkish flag, but he dislikes his rulers and would be glad to be rid of them. The Bani Hajar tribes can muster about 4,500 fighting men, which with the Shaikh’s 2,000, would give altogether 6,500; but 4,500 represents as large a force as he is ever likely to bring together. Since about 1900 various attemps have been made by the Porte to assert its sovereignty in other parts of the Qatar peninsula, and in 1910 Turkish mudirs were to be despatched to Zubarah, ? Odaid, Wakrah, and Abu ’Ali Island. His Majesty’s Government, however, protested against this, and, indeed, have never acknowl edged Turkish rule in A1 Qatar. In 1913 Turkey consented to remove her garrison from Qatar; but that agreement has not yet been signed, hence the garrison remains. Dohah .-—Dohah which is the chief town of Qatar, stands on the south side of a deep bay on the Qatar Peninsula, which forms a natural harbour about 3 miles in circumference. The harbour is landlocked with a narrow and shallow entrance, allowing no entry to ships of over 15' draught. The soundings inside the harbour vary from 3 to 5 fathoms and are regular. Landing is easy, and not likely to be interfered with by a swell. There is no information about any piers or wharves. The town is built up the slopes of some rising ground, and has a frontage towards the sea of nearly 2 miles. The Turkish garrison lives in the fort of A1 Bida’, which is in the centre of the town and a little back from the sea. The garrison consists of, at the most, 100 infantry and the r e are said to be 12 gunners in charge of two old guns. There is an outpost of eight Turkish soldiers in a tower, over the well of Rushairib, about a mile from the fort.180 The population consists of about 12,000, and is made up of Arabs, Negroes and Persians. They are more likely to side with the British than with the Turks. The only water in the town is from a well of brackish water. The town supply is drawn from some good wells about 3 to 4 miles inland. There are no supplies, and even firewood is scarce. Shaikh ! Abdullah, who succeeded to the chiefship of Qatar in 1913, is friendly towards the British, and afraid of Bin S’aud. He would no doubt be glad to be rid of the Turks.APPENDIX B. Important personages. Shaikh Khazal Khan, K.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., of Mulmirmar h (Sardar-i-Arfa’) was bom in 1861, and succeeded his brother in 1897. He is to all intents and purposes independent of the Persian Government. He has alwaj^s been consistently friendly to the British, and now in his old age depends more than ever on British advice. H e i s a capable and sensible man; his influence reaches as far as Dizful, where the Luis even respect him. He owns much territory on Turkish soil. Shaikh Chasib, Shaikh Khazal’s eldest son and heir was born in 1891. He was Governor of Ahwaz in 1912-13, but was said to be puerile and neglectful. Even the Shaikh was doubt ful whether the Arabs would accept him as chief. Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, the Shaikh’s right-hand man, born about 1850, an important and wealthy merchant. He is very friendly to the British, but not fully trusted by the Arabs. Both he and his son Mushir-ut-Tujjar have travelled in India. A very capable man in his prime, but is now too eld to do much. His son may succeed him as the Shaikh’s Wazir. Shaikh Hanzal Khan, brother of Shaikh Khazal, born about 1864, Commander-in-Chief to the Shaikh, formerly Governor of Ahwaz. Capable man resembling the Shaikh. Has no ambi tion regarding the succession but he is regarded with suspi cion by the Shaikh. Sardar-i-Jang', Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris, born about 1869. One of the best of the Bakhtiari Khans, being credited with pluck, and determination. In 1912-14 he was in charge of the Bakhtiari road, during which time he maintained some order,, and also showed a friendly attitude towards Great Britain. Nizam-vs-Sultaneh. appointed in 1914 to the governorship of Luristan. He had previously held the governorship of Bushire,. ’Arabistan and Bars.

Townley in 1914 found him furtive and unreliable, and intent on feathering his own nost. Sardar-i-Akram, Governor of Khurramabacb born about 1860 and lives at Tarkhan. He is bead of the Amari tribe of Burs182 and he has indirect control over a large number oi tribes. He is a man of some energy and ability, and has shown himself friendly to British travellers. He is addicted to drink and opium. . °f Pusht-i-Kuh, hereditary ruler of the Lurs of Pusht- i-Kuh is in alliance with the Shaikh of Muhammareh, being a member of the famous League of the South, which included the tUshqai and some of the Bakhtiari Khans. He is very hostile to the Turks on the border. Shaikh of Kuwait. —Sir Mubarak bin Subah, K.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., born about 1850, beginning to suffer from senile decay. Dislikes Turks and is friendly to Great Britain. H. s absolute power. Abdul Aziz bin Sa vd.- —Wahabi Shaikh of Najd, has ap proached British political officers on more than one occasion to treat for terms of an alliance against the Turks. In May 1913, he drove the Turks out of A1 Hasa, and in May 1914, was appointed Wali and Commander-in-Chief of Najd under the nominal sovereignty of Turkey. He could raise 5,000 lo 7,000 well armed fighting men. He stands head and shoulders above other Arab chiefs, and they have implicit faith in him. A jaimi. —Son of Sa’adun Pasha, late chief of the Muntafik Arabs. Sa’adun Pasha was arrested by the Turks in August 1911 through the treachery of Sayid Talib, and deported to Aleppo, v here he died immediately after his arrival. Ajaimi has several times threatened Basrah. Saiyid Talib Bey {naqibzadah). Deputy for Basrah, born about 1870 ; of great influence among the Arabs of Basrah. Until March ^1914 he was looked upon as a leader of the Arab revolt at Basrah ; but then he suddenly became a pro-Turk. Strong, wilful, utterly unscrupulous, usually in debt. Held Basrah in the palm of his hand by means of a band of armed men. Has about a dozen murders to his credit, submitted to us, January 1915. Now in India*.

A rival of Bin Sa’ud and a protege of the Turkish Government. Reported to have been defeated by Bin Sa’ud on January 24th, ! 1915. Owing to an ancestor of the ruling family of the Shammar tribe having been called Rashid, the ruler of the day is usually spoken of as Ibn Rashid.189 APPENDIX D. WEIGHTS, MEASURES, CURRENCY, CHRONOLOGY. Weights .—The standards of weight vary from place to place, and we shall therefore deal chiefly with those of Baghdad, the commercial capital. At Baghdad two systems of weighment exist side by side which may be called the local and the non-local. The first is applied, with certain exceptions, to local produce and is founded upon the Baghdad or large Huqqah—in English generally called “ Qke of 8 lbs. 12 oz. 8 dr. English : the other has for its basis the Constantinople Huqqah of 2 lbs. 12 oz. 12 dr. English and is used for all imported, and even for certain other articles. The Baghdad local weights remain the same whatever the substance weighed and are as follows :— 4 Ruba’ 1 Ruba’ «. 1 Waqiyah English, lbs. oz. dr. 0 8 12 £ 2 3 2 2 Waqiyah .. 1 Huqqah 8 12 8 1| Huqqahs .. 1 Charak 13 2 12 4 Charaks 1 Mann 52 11 0 4 Manns .. 1 Waznah 210 12 0 20 Waznahs ,. 1 Taghar 4,215 0 0 Wood and charcoal are weighed by a Waznah of 50 Constant* inople Huqqahs or 139 lbs. 3 oz. 8 dr. English ; wheat and barley by a different Waznah of 78 Constantinople Huqqahs or 218 lbs. 2 oz. 8 dr. English. In the case of wood 20 Waznahs or 1,000 Constantinople Huqqahs make a Taghar of 3,784 lbs. 6 oz. 0 dr. English. The French kilogramme, equal to 2 • 20485 lbs. English, is in use to a limited extent as an official measure under the name of Huqqah ’Ashshari or decimal Huqqah, and 100 kilogrammes are treated in the case of grain as equivalent to 1 Waznah. Apo thecaries employ the French kilogramme with its sub-divisions and multiples. At Basrah the unit of local weight is a Huqqah of 2lbs, 12 oz. English and the local Waqiyah is 2| Huqqahs. A Mann of ghi190 at Ra^ah is 50 local Huqqahs and a Mann of grain 60; and the Basrah laghar containing 1,200 Huqqahs is treated as roughly equivalent to 1 | tons English. * y Measures. -At Baghdad there are three measures of length, each founded upon a different Dhara’- or “ yard.” The Ohara’ Baghdad—or Bagdad yard—is the most generally used and isequa! to 29| English inches ; it is sub-divided into 4 Charaks o / j 6 inches apiece, and each of these again in to 4 ’Aqads of l- 5 -®- incnes apiece. The Ohara’ Halab—or Aleppo yard is employed in measuring silks and woollens and is equal to 26| inches; it is sub-dmded m a similar manner to the Bagdad yard, giving a Charak consequently of 6 f and an ’Aqad of Hi inches. In measuring carpets and in other transactions with Persians the b andard is the Ohara’ Shah—of about 41 inches; its Charak, also called a Ruba , equals 10J, and its ’Aqad 2 f inches. British goods are estimated in British yards, and other European goods jn French metres Thus we have three different Charaks of length, as well as Bie Charak of weight, and a Ruba’ of length besides the Ruba of weight. Liquids.—There are no standard measures for liquids, and these are sold by the pot or the bottle, the pots being of all Bises and the bottles generally reputed pints or quarts. Distances. —Oistan ces, except in official measurements which are made by Kilometres, are estimated in hours and days • the unit is the space covered by a walking horse in sixty minutes and so fluctuates from about 3 to 4} miles. Land measurement,—The commonest unit of land measure ment is the Faddan—which varies in size from one place to an other and at Bagdad is variously defined as “ the area that two ^ w f &amp; SUrface that can be completely sown 1900 ^ and 700 Huqqahs of barley,’’ in all 1,200 (Constantinople) Huqqahs. The Baghdad Faddan is also described as containing 200 Donums-each of 919 square metres ana as being equal to 18 Jaribs, each of 10,000 square metres or rather more : this would give the Faddan an area of about in it TfiOO TV 1 ' 116 ’ S rSu Uld ** men tinned, is sub-divided mto 1,600 Bhira Ma man. There is also a Juft, the area that a yoke of bu locks can plough, which is from 70 to 100 Donums. At Basrah the Faddan is unknown and the unit of land measure ment is a Jarib.-which is about equal to If English acres and is supposed to contain 100 date palms.k 191 Currency.—The question of the currency in ’Iraq is difficult and complicated. The only fixed standard of value is the Lirah or Turkish pound, ordinarily worth about 18s. of British money, and to it all other coins and denominations must be regarded as subsidiary ; they are numerous and some of them are fictiti ous, while the values of others are fluctuating. The subject is discussed below with reference to Baghdad rather than to Basrah. The Lirah is habitually resolved into no less than six different varieties of piastre or Qursh,— all of which are fic titious. The first of these is the “ gold ” piastre, which is simply of a Lirah and is the official piastre of the Turkish Government; all taxes and all payments to State departments must be rendered in gold piastres ; for example a one piastre postage stamp can only be purchased for a coin which, what ever its denomination may be, is currently worth-i- of a Lirah. The next three kinds of piastre are all termed Majidiyah, —but properly the name belongs to the first of them alone’ of which 102-6 go to a Lirah; the Imperial Ottoman Bank keeps its accounts in these as well as in gold piastres. The remaining sorts of Majidiyah piastre are one of which 103-5, and another of which 108, are equal to a Lirah ; the former of these is used by merchants in keeping their own books and for wholesale transactions generally, while the latter is employed partly for ease of calculation and partly on account of its close correspondence in value to the actual silver coin called a Qursh Sagh. The two remaining kinds of piastre, both called Raij,—are employed in retail accounts ; of the one there are 414 and of the other 432 to the Lirah, from which it will be seen that they are merely quarters of the Majidiyah piastres standing at 103-5 and 108 to the Lirah. M e now come to the actual medium of circulation. There are five Turkish gold coins of 5,2^, 1 , | and £ Lirahs res pectively ; but the first two are rarely seen, and the last is not very common. The chief Turkish silver coin is the Majidi which is worth 18-5185 gold piastres, 19,19-166 and 20 res pectively of the various kinds of Majidiyah piastre, and 76-666 and 80 respectively of the two sorts of Raij piastre. In cash transactions, in the absence of a special understanding, 6-4 Maiidis are accepted as the equivalent of one Lirah.
