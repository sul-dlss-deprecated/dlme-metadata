A commission to this effect is issued under the Sign Manual of His late Majesty on the 28th November 1834 289 130 &amp; 131 1834 On the 29th December 1834 the Sublime Porte grants a phirman authorizing the navigation of the Euphrates River by the above steamers ... 290 131 &amp; 132 1835 On the 11th February 1835 the Pacha of Bagdad issues a Booyooroldi to the Turkish officers on the Euphrates, directing them to afford protection to the expedition under Colonel Chesney, and to ren der all assistance in their power for the further ance of its objects 291 132 1835 Colonel Chesney arrives from England on the banks of the Euphrates, on the 18th July 1835, and puts together the two iron Steamers Euphra tes and Tigris, the materials for which had been forwarded vid the Mediterranean 292 132 1836 On the 19th March 1836 Colonel Chesney reports that both of the above vessels have been com pleted, and were then descending the great river... 292 132 1836 On the 21st May 1836 the Tigris steamer is upset in a squall in the Euphrates River and founders.

D. G.I &amp; SUMMARY. In a letter dated the 5th October 1844 Mr. Currie, Secretary to the Government of India, communicated to this Government the request of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General in Council to be furnished with— ' a succinct report showing our first connection with Turkish Arabia, the names of the several Political Agents, with dates of appointment and salaries, and cost of establish ment, &lt;fec.; in short, all the changes and modifications in the establishments, &amp;c., of that agency from our first connection with it up to the present time.' 2. On receipt of this letter, the Hon'ble Board directed that a summary should, as soon as more pressing duties might admit, be pre pared by the Secretary in the Political Department, of the kind called for by the Government of India. It was at the same time resolved that the Civil Auditor should be required to furnish the information neces sary in regard to the salary and establishments at different periods of the several officers who have filled the office of Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, and that information should also be obtained in regard to the annual expense of the steamer Nitocris, then employed on the Euphrates River. 3. In reply to a call made upon him, in conformity with the above resolution, the Civil Auditor, on the 13th December 1844, forwarded to Government a statement showing the names, salary, and establishment of the several officers who filled the appointment of Political Agent in lurkish Arabia from the year 1788 to 1844, the former being, the Civil Auditor stated, the earliest date from which this infwrmation could be traced from his records. 4. The Military Auditor-General, in a letter dated the 18th ^November 1844, stated, in reply to a call made upon him, that the total annual expense of the remaining steamer (the Nitocris) employed on the Euphrates River amounted to Rupees 55,098-5-0. The Civil Auditor and Military Auditor-General's reports, containing the above informa tion, were, on receipt, forwarded to the Government of India, with an intimation that the remainder of the information required by that authority would hereafter be forwarded, and which, as above stated, the Secretary in the Political Department was requested by the Hon'ble Board to prepare from the old records of this Government. 5. The delay which has taken place in complying with this call of the Hon'ble Board has been occasioned by a great and constant pressure of business in the departments under the charge of the Political Secre tary, and also from the extreme labor attendant on tracing out the requisite data from the old records, occasioned partly from a great diffi culty in deciphering the character of the writing adopted in the seven teenth century, which has rendered a perusal of the records of that date an exceedingly tedious occupation; and partly from there being no Index in existence for the records of that period to assist in directing attention to the particular subject on which information has been called for by the Government of India. I now beg to submit to the Hon'ble Board the result of my search. A2 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 6. The earliest information I have been able to trace in regard to the existence of a commercial establishment in Persia belonging to the Hon'ble East India Company commences with the year 1630. 7. The oldest records in the possession of this Government are copies of some letters from the Chief in Council of the Hon^ble East India Company^ Eactory at Surat during the year 1630. The whole of these letters, with two exceptions, are addressed to the Commanders of the East India Company^ vessels at anchor off Surat, and to the Chief in Council of the subordinate factories of Ahmedabad, Cambay, Broach, Brodera, Agra, and Masulipatam. The two exceptions are—one letter to the address of the Hon'ble East India Company, dated the 26th February 1630, and one to the Chief in Council of the Eactory in Persia, dated the 6th October of the same year. 8. The former of these two last mentioned letters bears the earliest date of any document on the records of this Government. This letter, from which the following is the verbatim extract, is addressed ' To the Hon'ble Companie' by Mr. Thomas Rastell, and is dated on board the ship James, Augustine's 11 Bay, 26th July 1630. Erom subsequent letters, Mr. Rostell appears, when the above was written, to have been on his way out from England to Surat to assume the office of Chief at the Hon'ble East India Company's factory at that place :— ' Eight Worshipful! Itt hath pleased the Almeightye God, in his great goodness, to protect us hither in safetie and blessed unitie and concord together, the 14th day of this present month, our people generally then in reasonable good plight, and without the losse of any more than five men in our whole shipe, for the which His mercies may His blessed name be magnified for ever ! Wee met not with any accidents in our pas sage hither that is worth your notice, nor did wee touch att all at the Cape, having before most happilie fallen upon the Island of Trimdada lying in the latitude of 20 and 40 ms., where wee had both safe rydinge and very plentiful refreshment, both of fish and fowl in great abundance, and where I should wish all our outward-bound fleets might endeavour futurely to stay, as a place more safe than the Cape, and more easie to get off without the least tardiness or difficultie, the water being excellent good, though a little troublesome in its conveyance into our boates. The further description whearof, as of the island itselfe, together with the reasons of our not fullie watei-iuge thearfor that tyme, I referr unto the Commander's relason* hear with all, and proceed to other advice following. ' Att this island wee arrived the 20th day of May, and sett sayle againe the 25th ditto; and having doubled the Cape without touching there as aforesaid, I saw fair likely- hood of a greate proportion of tyme to be advanst unto us serving to no other use in your benefit than fruitlesslye to be cast away on eating and drinking att all the islands, and therefore fell into consideration how to make use of their advantage unto your behoust; and that in communicating my mynde with the Commander in private, and afterwards to the rest in publique, how greatly it would redowne to the conveynience, strength, and benefit of your trade and state and ffleet that possibly Persia might be seasonably attayned before our arrival att Surratt; but soo as the adventures of your business in the one might no way prejudice the other. Thus att my arrivall here at St. Lawrence * * * wee most pvosprously found these ships, the Charles and Jonas, the 14th of the present month ****** to Mr. Wilde and Captaine Widdell * * * * highly applauded the designe, espetially * * * * stood the grounds #**»** there being no fortes in the Gulfe * * * * first that so much ******** would bee hereby secured, which other wise must runne a hazard with the rest upon the Coast of India, and the likelyest place of the two for our ffleets to be assaulted; that being disburthened of soo much a Madagascar. * The words cannot be deciphered in places where asterisks occur.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 3 lading our shippe would bee the more priddie, our lower ordnance at libertye for defence, which are got by the deepnes of our shippes, and are so useful, and our roome in hould the more for pleasuring of the Moors and increase of our freight and customs in Persia. That in respect of your commission, in ordering the next yeare's silke, to be down at portc vn that yeare's 1st August attthe furthest, it would be a great forwarJing thereunto by the advance this way of four or five months' tyme for the furtherance of that mayne designe. which otherwise, in my opinion, may runne some hazard of prolongason ; that I myselfe shall have a faire opportunitie of conference with the factors there, whereby to be informed of many particulars which by letters att soo farr a distance as India from thence they will either neglect, or peradventure not dare att all to advise; and lastly the advantage of forestalling of the Duttch in our marketts, chiefly in the choyse and acomodatting of ourselves with the fittingest assortments of silke, and soo leave the refuse up on the Duttch, which I consider to be a point of weighty consideration. On these foundations wee have built our resoluson (at the least to endeavour this our purpose) for Persia, and shall hasten the prosecution thereof with all possible delligence, yet with such reservation as wee dare not promise you any other performance save in than what the windes and faire success in our voyage shall administer, for in case of any thing occurring in the passage to crosse us. Wee shall then disturb this intention, and apply ourselves for Surratt first as other fileets heretofore.' 9. The following' are extracts from the letter to which I have alluded above as having been addressed by the Chief in Council at Surat to the Chief in Council of the East India Company's Factory in Persia, dated the 6th October 1630. In order to render these and other extracts which I shall have occasion to quote in this summary the more readily intelligible, I purpose to adopt the mode of spelling followed at the present day, and not to observe the abbreviations in the different words as they occur in the orig'inals. The letter above alluded to com mences—' Worshipful and our very loving- friends, Mr. Burt in Council,' and is addressed ' to Persia, Overland.' ' The loss of the Charles and Jonas, the monsoon this year, for England hath forgotten a resolution in us to avoid the like inconvenience for the present by making Persia the last port of despatch to the home-bound ships Discoverye and Refor mason ; your account of the old joint stock therefore, together with that of the new, would be in a readiness, namely, and copy of oath to be sent to the Company by that conveyance, and the others to be dispeeded unto us, wherein, if any remains of either, you may have recourse to the Company's orders herewithal, appointing how you shall govern your selves in its valuation and transport from one unto another.

The East India Company, as will be hereafter seen, had an important factory at Gombroon.4 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 10. The above extracts shew that previous to the year 1630 the Hon'ble East India Company had not only established factories at Surat, which was the principal station, to which all the others were subordinate, and at Agra, Ahmedabad, Broach, Brodera, Cambay, and Masulipatam, but also at Gombroon, now generally called Bunder Abbass, at the entrance of the Persian Crulf, and also in 1 ersia, the factors stationed in that country being, as would appear from subsequent extracts, which will be given in this Summary, subordinate to the Chief in Coun cil of the Factory at Gombroon, who again were subordinate to the Factory at Surat. 11. In a minute recorded by Mr. Francis Warden, when a member of this Government, dated the 8th October 1824, the following brief account is given of the circumstances under which a factory was first established by the Hon'ble East India Company at Bussorah ' In order that we might retire to some situation in the Gulf, where we might be beyond the reach of the oppressions which our factories experienced in the kingdom of Persia, we established a factory at Bussorah in 1639-40, when we obtained a license from the Turkish Bashaw to land our goods under more favourable circumstances than any other European nations enjoyed.' Unfortunately there are no records in existence in the possession of this Government for the period intervening between the years 16-30 and 1645. It is therefore impossible to ascertain from what source Mr. Warden obtained the above information. It is however evident from the following letter, dated the 1st December 1645, which was addressed by two joint factors at Bussorah to the Chief in Council at Surat,* that the East India Company had, previous to the latter date, a factory at Bussorah. This letter is to the following effect:— ' Worshipful and our much respected friends! ' Since Mr. Cranmer and Company's friends leaving Bussorah, little or nothing hath happened, only we have made sale of a small quantity of the Company's goods to the amount of Rupees 81,96,850. The markets are so bad, and buyers so few, that we doubt the major part of our Hon'ble employers' goods will be remaining till the beginning of next monsoon. ' The Pattamar we despatched the 26th October, with those letters directed to our Hon'ble employers, which we hope are safe arrived with the Consul, to whom we wrote a few lines to desire him to send them forward by the first conveyance. The Dutch have made sale of their whole magazine of goods, which amounts not to more than 35 or 36 rupees at most, they paying customs Rupees 2,275. The trumpeter, which run away from the Endeavour 20 days after her departure from hence, we had notice of his ranging the streets of Bussorah, when myself and William Weale, looking out for him, found him in the house of one who some three years past was servant to our Hon'ble employers, but now a merchant. We have prevailed with the Dutch that he might take his passage on them to Gombroon, where they are to deliver him into the hands of Mr. Haynes, who will take further orders for his voyaging towards you. By two Padres, who lately arrived here, we came to understand the Prince of Orange is dead, and that the young Prince, his son, hath made peace with the King of Spain; that the lower Dutch' assisted our King,t and that he had gained a great victory over the Parliament's force, and was marching to London. » Note .—Being seventeen years previous to the Island of Bombay being ceded by Portugal to the crown of England as part of the dowry of the Infanta Catherine on her marriage with His Majesty Charles II., and 22 years previous to Bombay being made over by the King to the East India Company, f King Charles the 1st.WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 5 ' Here goeth enclosed a list of what goods sold, with a list of prices, copy of our instructions, and copy of goods remaining at Mr. Cranmer's departure hence.

The following is copy of another letter from the same parties, written about the same time as the foregoing:— ' Worshipful and our much honored friends ! ' By Pymaree Francois, who arrived here the 16th present, we received your advice, bearing the 31st December, therein blaming us for our neglect in not writing by the Endeavour, which we, not knowing how to excuse, desire your worshipful Com pany's favourable censure, and for the future do promise amendment. Both the goods remaining with, and now sent unto, us you were pleased to recommend to our care and we promise our utmost endeavours to make sale of them as soon as any buyers shall proffer themselves. At present there is not one of quality in town, nor is it likely there will any arrive till the monsoons, when the utmost of our care shall be in vending them to the best advantage. ' The pepper is all landed, and agrees with the invoice in amount of bags, but not a merchant yet will proffer more than three rupees, Bussorah maund, which, if we would make sale of it all, at that price it should go, but they who proffer it will not have more than two or three maunds at most, so that per force we must keep it: we hope for a better time. In case we should have broke the price at three rupees, then we must be forced to sell the remainder at a lower rate, to prevent which we determined to make sale of it after the ship's departure. ' The ship's stay here was longer than intended * vending the pepper * should not happen * laden on board the Francois, and sent you Rupees 5,000 made up in a chest marked with the Company's mark, they being for goods formerly sold, as will appear by the list of goods sold, here enclosed. ' The pattamar, f which was sent to Alleppo the 25th October, is not returned nor can we get any certain news of him, only was told of his being at Mahomed Hussen a town eight days' journey beyond Bagdad, very sick : since, no notice what is become of him, but believe he is dead, and thereby your worshipful Company frustrated of such letters, &amp;c , as were sent from Alleppo by him. What letters or aught other that should come from our Hon'ble employers shall, with all care, be speedily sent towards you, but as yet none are arrived.

Nothing- further can be traced connected with the Gombroon or Persian factories from the above period (1646) until the year 1656. From a letter dated the 29th November 1656, addressed by the Chief in Council at Gombroon to the Chief in Council at Surat, it appears that Mr. William Weale, one of the parties above alluded to as having been in charg-e of the Factory at Bussorah, and by whom both of the letters last quoted are signed, died at Ispahan in September 1656. The follow ing is an extract from this letter :— 'Our last unto you was dated in Ispahan the 17th September, which came to the hands of Mr. Thomas Reynardson in Bunder,* who sent them towards you on the Seajiower, who left this place the 22nd October, which I hope is come safe to your reception. Long since is advised you of the death of Mr. William Weale in Ispahan, and of all other occurrences in the Company's affairs to that day, whose copy shall be sent you by the next conveyance.' 15. The following is an extract from a further letter, written at Shiraz on the 7th November 1656 by the same parties, who, as above stated, were the Chief in Council of the East India Factory at Gombroon. This letter is dated three weeks previous to the one from which the extract above quoted is taken, but did not, as appears from a memo randum made on the letter, reach the Chief in Council of the Factory at Surat until a week after the receipt of the one of subsequent date:— ' Please to take notice that our last unto you was dated in Ispahan the 28th August, whose copy is here sent you ; and what hath been since accounted worthy your notice shall in the following lines be advised you. The 11th September, after a long and tedious consumption, it pleased the Almighty to take out of this life Mr. William Weale, your servant, and our chief head in Persia, and the day following buried him in as decent a manner as we could, and, indeed, according as he desired before his death. He died without will, we not being able to persuade him to make it and to settle his estate. What moveables he had in Ispahan, we took an inventory of, and carried them with us, and what he hath more in Gombroon shall do the like when we come there, and send them all to Surat. Our stay in Ispahan this year was occasioned by the great desire we had to put off what goods you had there, as also to carry your orders down with us, which at last we effected.' In a subsequent letter, dated Gombroon, the 15th December 1656, the same pai'ties made a general report on the state of the Company's affairs in Persia, and at the same time forwarded an inventory of the effects of Mr. Weale at Gombroon. 16. In a letter dated the 16th October 1657 a Mr. Bell, in writing from Gombroon to the Chief in Council at Surat, observes— ' I was not so happy as to receive any letters from your Company while I was in Bussorah, but I hope between this time and the time the Seaflower\ will sail hence they will come either from Bussorah or by way of Ispahan. I have received orders from Mr. Andrews to send on the Seaflower 400 tomans Nondunga money for account of the Hon'ble Company, which by her you may expect. From Bussorah I could make but little more than Rupees 900 freight, all in money ; so that from hence I hope to get a full freight of goods and passengers, the Kaffilas being now at hand.' * Meaning no doubt Bunder Abbass, alias Gombroon. + One of the East India Company's vessels.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 7 17. ^ The next document on the records of Government, in which mention is made of Bussorah, or the East India Company^ ' Agency in Persia,' occurs in the following extract from the proceedings' of the Chief in Council at Surat, dated the 21st January 1661:— 0 ' Thc A S enc y of Persia, through the death of Mr. Foster and the return of agent Buckendg, being unfurnished with a person qualified for so eminent an employinent, we have made choice of Mr. Richard Cradock to succeed and of Mr. George Cranmer to be his second, and Mr. William Kolt, a young man well deserving to' 5 accompany them, and be employed as the said Mr. Cradock shall find him capable. A consider able quantity of Scinda goods being returned hither from Persia and JBussora as impro per lor those markets, we conclude it most for the benefit of our employers to send them to the market of Mocha.' The following Commission was ' at the same time issued by the Chief in Council at Surat to Mr. Kichard Cradock appointing him the Hon'ble East India Company's Agent in Persia.

In her we shall expect a portion of customs so much as you can persuade the Shawbunder to part with ; the practice of the Persians for these many years hath been still to cut off as much of the Hon ble Company s due as they could persuade our friends there to rest silent with, for which reason and many other not here mentioned, the Hon'ble Companv reso ved of another course to betaken with them besides fair words, which yet hath not been put in practice, yet they fear what they deserve and hope, is being civilly uro-ed and the advantage made use of may cause them to comply, and beget a more open hand than formerly, so that we shall not expect less than one thousand tomaunds though got what you can ; four hundred or more on this ship we desire you to return' Kobert Manly we have now entertained into wages in the Company's service at si* tomaunds salary yearly; he hath been a constant servant in the house, and now we send mm to wait on you, he being not only furnished with language enough that qualifies him for employment as Interpreter, but experience in trading with the Khan, * This word cannot be deciphered.8 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E.

So much hath been the villainies and baseness of Tockersee that long since we turned him out of the Hon'ble Company's employment, and then sent for him to repair hither that he might have justice done him, as on the side also of the Hon'ble Company; but those we employed failed us, and Mr. Buckeridg promised to bring him, but sickness prevented: we sent therefore Captain Middleton to force him hither, but if our expecta tion be not answered, and that you cannot procure his mission so much desired, we do by these presents discard him the Company's service and forbid him coming into their house or any employment in reference to their affairs, having, for the despatch of what affairs of theirs of the nature as shall present, sent another along with you named Suntockee Verchez, having had experience of his abilities both here and there, also as good security for his truth, therefore shall recommend him unto you for his encourage ment.

On the 13th April 16G1 a Commission was issued by the President in Council, Surat, to the Commander of the ship Amerira, on her proceeding on a voyag-e to Gombroon, and thence to Bussora. This document, which is signed by 'Mathew Andrews' and ' John Lambton/ is headed— ' Commission and instructions given by me, the President and Council of India, Persia, &amp;c., unto our loving friend. Captain Thomas Crouther, Commander of the Frigate Amerira, now by God's permission bound from Swally Hole unto the port Gombroon, and from thence to the port of Bussorah, within the Kiver Euphrates, to be observed by him until his return to Swally Hole again. Dated on Swally Marine, the 13th day of April, Anno, 1661.' The following is an extract from this Commission :— ' You being now laden with most part of the Hon'ble Company's goods and completed with freight, we desire you on sight hereof, wind and tide permitting, to weigh anchor and set sail directing your course for Gombroon, there to deliver our letter to our friends there resident, which we hope may be done in one or two * It appears, from this and many similar expressions which occur in other letters of the same date, that at this period the East India Company forwarded the originals of their letters to the Chief in Council of the factory at Surat overland vid Constantinople, Aleppo, Bagdad, and Bussora, by Cossids, and thence by sea; the vessel conveying them calling at Gombroon. The duplicates were forwarded vid the Cape.WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 9 days at the most, which done, make what haste possible to obtain the port of Hussorah, where arriving, you are to set on shore Mr. George Cranmer and Mr. Kobert Sainthill decently, affording them upon all occasions that the Hon'ble Company's business requires it, the use of the boats well manned, and to observe their order in the unlading of your vessel, and lading any freight goods, &amp;c., from thence upon her. As also in their passage thither the use of the great cabin wholly, and to receive your despatch from them, which we enorder to be by the 20th September without fail, Mr. Sainthill returning with you in the vessel, in your way touching at Gombroon, there to take in 30 or 40 tomans of red earth for the homeward-bound voyage.' 19. The following- Commission was at the same time issued to Mr. Cranmer and Mr. Sainthill on their proceeding in the above vessel:— ' Commission and instructions given by us, the President in Council of India, Persia, &amp;c., unto our loving friends, Mr. George Cranmer and Mr. Robert Sainthill, to be observed by them on their voyage to Bussorah and return to Swally Hole, dated on Swally Marine, the 13th April 1661. The Surat frigate arriving so late from her intended voyage to Cale * * * * though she obtained not her port, j-et with a great deal of trouble and charge brought up hither the cloth made there for the market ot England; but in opening and overlooking found it not so fit for England, being a slight-made cloth, therefore have laden that and pepper, cassia, lignum, rice, &amp;c^ to make up a considerable cargo, and have appointed you, Mr. George Cranmer, chief, and Mr. Robert Sainthill, to keep the account of the voyage, now intended upon frigate Amheritu to Bussorah, there, when arrived, to unlade first the freight goods now shipped, and in that time to salute the Bashaw from us, delivering our letters, acquaint ing him with our expectation of his making good his last year's promise of furnishino' you with a better house than that taken from the Hon'ble Company; but if you should not obtain our desire, you must hire a convenient house for the lading of merchandize. But take care not to land more of the prementioned goods than you can sell to advant age, because of the paying of customs; and if the bazaar of Bussorah affords not a price considerable, that is, profitable, then keep them on boardship, returning them upon the ship to us. And when you dispeed the Amerita from you, which we desire you to keep no longer than the 20th September at farthest, let Mr. Sainthill come upon her, giving him order that at his arrival at Gombroon, he proffer to sale the said cloth also at your now going, if opportunity presents, of a word to profit let not slip the oppor tunity, which you may make trial of by carrying on shore musters at your arrival, for we desire you not to stay longer in the road of Gombroon outward bound than two days at most; in this business we would have you careful, because, if the cloth cannot be sold to profit, we intend it at last home. The rest of the goods being wholly for the Bussorah bazaar, we make no doubt of their sale, and therefore consign them to you for the best disposal. There is dispeeded you two packets for our Hon'ble employers, the first of which send away as soon as arrived, the other send days ten after, with a letter to the Consul to hasten them forward. Mr. Cranmer we have enordered to take his passage unto us upon the Ormus Merchant, which may stay some time after the Amerita, and suppose he may have occasion so to do by reason of the slow coming in of money, and we positively enorder that none may be left behind, nor bad debts made. Copy of the Commander's commission is included you, therefore needless to rehearse anything concerning it, but only to require your assisting him in what he is commanded, if opportunity of matter of fact presents. We have here paid ********* 1 radre Barnaby s bill of exchange, but desire him hereafter to forbear that practice; for it any charge of letters has not in your absence, we desire him to forbear his money till arrival of some of our nation in the time of the monsoon to pay it him ; and from Gombroon take off two chests of wine to present him, as two also you may take off for your house expenses to our friends there; we have wrote accordingly ; as also that you may have the use of the carpet and chairs. What monies that they have in Bunder you receive for goods sold, convert into gold ******* those that are stamped with the effigy of Prince, and none other, there being of late many counterfeit of the other sort. Concerning the obtaining of the house, we must leave you to use such argument as may best prevail—and take notice, we shall not allow of any money to be spent upon it, we say any considerable, that is, the amount of Rupees 300 or 400; for it would be cheaper for the Hon'ble Company to hire a house for their occasion than # These words cannot be deciphered in the original.10 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E.

We have not more to enlarge, but wishes for your good health and a safe arrival unto your assured friends. '(Sd.) Mathew Andrews. „ John Lambton.' 20. On the 18th March 1661 the Chief in Council at Surat deputed two of their servants, Mr. Richard Bladwell and Mr. Ralph Lamhton, to Mocha, with an investment of goods, with instructions, after disposing of them, to dissolve the East, India Company's Factory at that place, when Mr. Lambton was ordered to proceed on to Gom broon and Bussorah and Mr. Bladwell to return to Surat from Mocha. The following is an extract from the Commission issued on this occasion to these gentlemen by the Chief in Council at Surat:— ' In June we make no doubt but you will be ready to dispeed the Seaflower by the middle at the farthest, if not sooner. We desire it may be accomplished, and on her Mr. Ralph Lambton and Henry Bromfield to voyage ; the cargo to be consigned to Mr. Ralph Lambton for dispose, and the Chief of Bussorah, in case any be there at his arrival, or he voyage thither for it. At Bussorah, we say Gombroon, 30 per cent, profit, clear of all charges (freight reckoned in), can be obtained there. Mr. Lamb ton—You have license to make sale of it there; if not, to proceed to Bussorah ; this we desire your notice of; and because the freight of the prementioned Chelabye's goods is agreed for Bussorah also, being no other ship going thither with that commodity, will cause the rising in price, unless you can agree with his vakeel to sell at Gombroon also. This we leave unto your discretion to conclude, desiring it may be so acted that aftenvards there may be no pretences, nor trouble. Mr. Bladwell— You are to return on the Gurusavoy, one of the King's junks, with what money of the Company's, &amp;c., you shall be possessed of, and hope Mr. Sainthill also : for if he observes order, we desire you to give him the respect of Chief in the management of our masters' affairs, but take great care you be not baffled by him, or over-ready by fair words or promises to no purpose. This affair is weighty, you go about, being the clearing of the factory is our desire and order, and therefore so act that you may have reputation with our Hon'ble employers, and commendation from them, who are your assured friends.' 21. From the above it would appear that, in the year 1661, the East India Company had no Agent or Chief constantly residing at Bussorah, but that one or more of their servants, belonging to the Factory at Surat or at Gombroon in the Persian Gulf, was, from time to time, sent to Bussorah for the sale and purchase of investments, and that they returned to their station on the completion of the service on which they had been sent. 22. In January 1661 a Treaty of 67 articles was entered into between Great Britain and Turkey to the effect of Appendix A., annexed to this Summary. This Treaty was concluded on the part of the British Government by— ' Heneage, Earl of Winchelsea, Ambassador Extraordinary from His Majesty King Charles II. to the Court of Mahomed, Sultan of Turkey. This Treaty, amongst other stipulations, provided that all vessels sailing under the British flag should be permitted to trade without molestation to all ports within the Turkish limits; that all British subjects should freely and securely come and go by land through all the imperial limits of the Turkish dominions; and at their own pleasure, safely and securely, traffic in all parts of those dominions;' and that all accusations, of whatever kind, made against Englishmen residing in or passing* through Turkish territory should be investigated J. riri WWITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 11 in the presence of the British Ambassador or Consul. It was further agreed that all privileges and capitulations which in former times had been granted by the Turks to the French, or any other Christian nation, should also be conceded to the English; that no English Consul or Eesident in the Turkish dominions should, under any circumstances, be subject to imprisonment; and that no merchandize belonging to the English should be subject to a higher rate of customs in the Turkish dominions than 3 per cent. 23. In September 1765 a further Treaty to the effect of Appendix B. was concluded between Great Britain and Turkey, confirming, with several amendments, the above Treaty, and clearing up several ambiguous expressions in the former Treaty, which were considered to require explanation. 24. On the 22nd April 1663 the Hon^ble the Court of Directors of the India Company addressed a despatch to the Chief in Council at Surat expressing great dissatisfaction at the manner in which their mercantile affairs had been conducted at their Factory at Gombroon, and in Persia generally, and directing that the conduct of Mr. Pettit, then in charge of their affairs in that quarter, should be enquired into. The following is an extract from this despatch :— ' Concerning our Persia affairs, we have the less to say to you, being so dissatisfied with the management of all our business there, yet we can hope for little good from thence till you have changed the conduct of them, which we referred to your care and settlement the former year upon due examinations of the several accusations and charges against Mr. Pettit, from whom, since that time, we have received no despatches or account of our concerns there any way pleasing to us, but long impertinent rela tions, either foreign or very little relating to our business, while he is silent, or very short of, to the most material things which nearly concern us.' 25. The following is an extract from the reply returned by the Chief in Council at Surat to the above communication from the Hon'ble East India Company, dated the 4th April 1664:— ' We have considered of what you write concerning your factory of Persia, making your two propositions you there insert into them, enordering Mr. Cradock to repair io us by the next Bussorah ship that shall call there, and Mr. Fflower and Mr. Swinglehurst to continue, but not to journey up to Ispahan ; and this course we have at last thought the best for a year, two, or three, and not to draw them totally off, lest it cause a dispute of that small pittance we now receive from them conditionally. These remaining factors, now that the grar.deur is taken off, will be more moderated in their expenses, which, if you shall approve of, rather than to leave the port void of any English, be pleased to confirm by your next.' 26. There are no records in existence belonging to this Govern ment from the year 1664 to 1670. During the years 1671 and 1672 frequent correspondence took place between the Chief in Council at Surat with the East India Company's Factory in Persia and with the East India Company on the subject of the withholding, by the King of Persia, of the payment of the share possessed by the Company in the customs at Gombroon; and threats continued to be held out that even tually coercive measures would be resorted to to enforce this claim. It appears that at last the East India Company, despairing of ever obtaining a satisfaction of this claim, appealed to the King ol England, who addressed a conciliatory letter to the King of Persia on the subject. This letter, however, did not procure the desired effect.12 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 27. In a list, which is extant, of the names of the factories in the service of the Hon'ble East India Company belonging to Bombay in December 1672, and which also states at what station they were employed, the following parties are mentioned as having been then employed in Persia,* the head-qnarters of which factory were at Gombroon in the Persian Gulf. This list contains 57 names:— 1. Thomas Eolt, Chief. 2. Henry Young. 3. Samuel Carleton, Chirurgeon (Surgeon). 4. John Ffloat. 5. John Sharpe. The remaining factors (52 in number) are stated to have been employed at Surat and the subordinate factories—Bombay, Carwar, and Calicut' 28. In ' a list of y-e factors resident in y-e IWble Com pany's service in Surratt, and the factories subordinate thereto, anno 1676,' which contains 60 names, 21 are stated to have been then employed at Surat, 13 in Bombay, six at Rajapore, six 'in Carwar,' seven on Coast Malabar, four ' in Broach,' and three in Persia, namely, Thomas Holt, Chief, Samuel Darnelly, and John Sharpe. 29. On the 19th lebruary 1676 the following letter was addressed by the Chief in Council at Surat to the Chief in Council of the East India Company's Factory in Persia. The enclosed are— ' copies of our last unto you per ship Ryhme, bound directly to your port. We had once intended to have answered your several letters by this frigate, the Revenge, but she being despatched so suddenly, and at present we are busily employed in ordering and calculating the goods enordered be provided in the several factories for the ensuing year, that we cannot possibly respond to them now, but so desire your patience till we dispeed the Retm'ne, who is now ready to take in goods for Persia and liussorah, by whom we shall write you at large. In the interim, we remain,' &amp;c. 30. The following is an extract from a letter addressed by the Chief in Council at Surat to the Chief iu Council, Persia, dated the 7th April 1676:— ' In a former letter we advised you that, in obedience to the Company's express orders, we had appointed Mr. James Adames to assist as second in their factory at Persia, who now takes his passage on ship Reiume, and we desire you to receive him in said quality, and to deliver the Company's books unto him. We have also appointed Mr. Samuel Darnelly to be third, and would have Mr. James Adames and him to sign the general letters and have cognizance of all their affairs, it being their express order. And seeing there will offer little business in Persia this year, and the ship Returne being bound to Bussorah with freight goods, and will require an able person for the management of the affair, we thought good to appoint Mr. James Adames for that service, and at his return from Bussorah to stay at Gombroon as before. We desire you to furnish him with all things necessary for his voyage and stay at Bussorah—with bridle and saddle, somoances, canatts, &amp;c.; and what disbursements are made thereon must be charged to the ship's account.' 31. From the following extract from a letter addressed by the President in Council at Surat to the Chief in Council in Persia, dated * None are mentioned as having been stationed at Bussorah ; this circumstance tends to corroborate the supposition mentioned in paragraph that one of the factors at Gombroon from time to time proceeded to Bussorah for the sale and purchase of invest ments, and then returned to Gombroon.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 13 the 22nd September 1676, it appears that Mr. Thomas Holt, the East India Company's ' Chief in Persia/' was a short time previous to that date appointed by that authority their ' Agent' in Persia, feince our 'last despatches to you by ship Retume, we have received your advices of the 10th by the Revenge frigate and the Ghingavurr : in the first we read Mr. Kelt's indisposition to health, which affliction we hope continued not long upon him, and that the next advices will give us account of his good health. AVe have not hitherto received any orders from the Hon'ble Company for his leaving the charge they have entrusted him with, nor may we presume to call him thence without their permission ; for we find by their especial grace and favor to him that they did expect his longer residence there, having this year conferred the title of Agent on him, and appointed great quantities of Europe goods to be consigned him by their ships appointed to the service, with which honor we congratulate him, and proceed to acquaint you that it pleased the Almighty to bring in safety to Bombay, the 13th August, the Hon'ble Company's fleet consisting of five sail.' 32. In a letter dated the 14th July 1677, addressed from Surat by the President in Council, Surat, to the Deputy President in Council, Bombay, the following passage occurs, from which there can be no doubt that the East India Company's factories at Bussorah and all parts of Persia were under the control of Mr. Bolt, who, as above stated, was appointed in the previous year by them their Agent in Persia :—• ' If we can procure for the Retume a freight to Persia or Bussorah this year, we shall be mindful to recommend to the Agent in CouncU to send by her, when she returns, six or eight low-priced horses for supply of the troops.' 33. In another letter, dated the 4th May 1683, the Hon'ble Court observed:— ' The affairs of Persia we can say little to until we hear of the arrival of our Agent, Mr. Gibbs, from whom we have received only one short letter from Bussorah, the larger letter which he wrote us before being not yet come to our hands. 34. There are numerous letters on record, dated between the years 1683 and 1707, written from the Factory at Gombroon and from the Chief in Council of that Factory from Ispahan while on occasional visits at that place. In these letters, however, no allusion is made to any Agent on the part of the East India Company being permanently stationed at Bussorah. These letters allude to the sale of Company's investments in Persia, but no specific allusion is made to Bussorah, further than that the 'Bussorah ships' are occasionally mentioned, but no account is given of arrival or departure at that place, or ot w hat sales were ellected there on the Company's account. 35. Between 1708 and 1719 there are no records in existence belonging to this Government. In the Diary of this Government for the 20th t November 1720 the following entry occurs:— ' Imported the Hauk Goomy from Surat; received a letter from the Chief and factors thereof, the 16th instant, acknowledging the receipt of ours of the 9th instant, and advising us they had sent the several papers wrote for, which we intended to send by the Tartar, but they came too late. They likewise advise us they are apprehensive that new troubles will arise should any of the Bussorah ships fall into the pirates' hands. They enclose us an invoice of one hundred and fifty-eight bales of piece goods, amount ing to Rupees 55,887. 36. On the 6th April 1724, as appears from the following entry from the Diary of the Bombay Government, a special meeting of the14 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. President and Governor in Council was held, at which the following- resolutions were passed :— ' Read and approved our last consultation. The President acquaints the Board the occasion of this meeting is to consider of the state of our hon'ble masters' affairs in Persia, and the needful directions to be given that Agency by the Comptoir, now under despatch for Gombroon; and first our settlement at Bussorah, where it is observed there is nothing yet done for the advantage of our hon'ble employers, more than a promise obtained from the Bashaw that we shall pay but three per cent, duties on the broadcloth, none of which being disposed of at the time Mr. Houssay despatched those advices; the prospect he gives as of selling it seems rather an amusement than any real application to serve his employers, while he continues so much involved in private trade. ' The President further informs the Board that he has several representations made him from the claimants, inhabitants of Gombroon, on the estate of Edmund Wright, deceased; that there are also other demands on him here, and from other parts of India, that the said Mr. Isaee Houssay has carried with him to Bussorah the greatest part of the said Mr. Wright's effects without giving the parties any satisfaction, neither has he transmitted us copy of the deceased's will, whereby he might be authorized to act therein, or given us any account of the deceased's estate. That it is reported to him, the President, which Mr. John Hope* also declares to have heard, that the said Mr. Houssay will not return to Gombroon, but go from Bussorah to England; all which taking into consideration, and apprehending our hon'ble masters' credit may be affected by any of their chiefs withdrawing without adjusting the accounts of those who have demands on them, and it being also the positive orders of the Hon'ble Company that none of their servants shall repair to England without leave first obtained from hence, or their coming hither, it is resolved that Mr. Isaee Houssay be recalled from Bussorah to Gombroon in order to adjust the accounts of the creditors of the deceased Edmund Wright and himself, but be allowed to take his station there according to his standing in the service ; and for the better establishing that settlement, resolved that we recommend it to the Agent to repair thither, imless his stay at Gombroon shall be found more necessary; that then Mr. Edmund Edlyne go to Bussorah, and take with him such assistance as can be spared. ' Signed: likewise a notification to be made at Bussorah requiring all the subjects of Great Britain trading under the Hon'ble Company's protection to be conformable to the rules of the factory, and positively forbidding them to treat with the Government in any matters relating to their trade, but through the factory.' 37. The following 1 is a further extract from the Diary of the Bombay Government for the 16th January 1728 :— ' The Bussorah letters, brought us by the Brittannia, are dated the 17th and 18th of November; in the former Mr. French confirms the hopes he before gave us of a parcel of woollen goods being to be disposed of to advantage, provided the quantity does not exceed sixty bales of broadcloth and one hundred of perfects. He advises that soon after the date of his former letter the Bashaw made a demand of five cruz a head from the Persian servants in the European houses. The Dutch, who were first called upon, could not evade it, and therefore discharged their servants, but he, thinking it inconsist ent with the reputation of our hon'ble masters to abandon those under their pro tection, or comply with the demand, positively refused either, pleading and insisting that, by the phirmaund granted to the English, they were exempted from such impositions, offering to deliver up the same again if it was not intended to be conformed to, which at last had the desired effect. That upon the arrival of the Brittannia, the Bashaw sent to know the reason why he did not hoist the English flag as usual, seeing he had given liberty for it, upon which Mr. French took occasion to let him know it was because the late Khya insisted upon a present, which he could not answer giving. The Bashaw replied that the Khya had used both him and us very ill; but, as he was now dead and past his resentment, desired every thing may be buried in oblivion, at the same time sending an order by the Deputy Khya to our former landlord to let us have his house, directing him not to return till he had seen our flag hoisted, which was accord ingly done. Afterwards, at the Bashaw's desire, Mr. French paid him a visit, who received # One of the then Members of the Bombay Government.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 15 him very kindly, giving him many assurances of his friendship and good inclinations to encourage the British trade to that port. As house-rent is very dear there, he offers it to our consideration whether a part of it should not he borne by the private goods that shall hereafter be lodged in the factory. The further advices that they have certain news of the Turks coming to an agreement with the Ophgoons, and that Achmat Bashaw was expected to arrive at Bagdad in a few days. That Consul Purnell writes he has received advices from Constantinople of the death of His Majesty King George* at Osnabrug in his way to Hannover, and that the siege of Gibraltar was raised by the Spaniards. He encloses the account consulage from the 7th June to the 4th November, amounting to mamootys 29,041 and 16 goz ; the Hon'ble Company's account current and list of the outstanding debts at Bussorah, also manifest of freight laden on the Britannia for Surat and Bombay, amounting to 66,575 shahees and live goz ; and if a vessel comes thither in the month of October, and is per mitted to remain there till the middle of December, he says he does not in the least doubt meeting with good freights annually; the boats from Bagdad, and the caravan from Aleppo, generally arriving about that time. Concerning the outstanding debts, he observes that, for want of notes being taken from several of the debtors, they pretended they had paid them, and some of them are ready to swear to it, which gives him a great deal of trouble: however, he promises no endeavours shall be wanting on his part to recover them, and has got security for the payment of ' Swede Shroph's' debt in live months' time, which is the best composition he was able to make. This short letter of the 18th advises that a cossat was arrived from Aleppo with a confirmation of His Majesty's death. That the preliminaries to a Treaty were signed by the Emperor and the Allies, one of the articles whereof is that the Ostenders shall not trade to the East Indies for the space of seven years ; and it is not doubted but at the designed Con gress at Aix la Chappell the same will be for ever laid aside. That a cessation of arms is agreed upon between Spain and Great Britain, and it is not questioned, but the war is at an end.' 38. In the Diary for the 16th April 1728 the following entry occurs;— ' Returned the Dolphin, &amp;c. G-ullivatts from the northward, by whom we received a short letter from the Chief and factors at Surat, dated the 13th instant, enclosing two packets from Bussorah and Gombroon, forwarded by the William, who arrived at Surat Barr the 12th. Mr. French, in his advices under the 2nd March, says that the season of the year being now so far advanced, he cannot recommend the sending any cloth or long ells from Gombroon thither before the month of September, when he believes he shall be able to dispose of a small parcel of each at a tolerable price, but would not have above sixty bales of cloth an i three hundred pieces of long ells sent up at a time. That iron is at present in no demand, occasioned by the troubles of Avive and Sonstere, which are the places that take off that commodity. That the Government continues very favorable, and the Bashaw, in very strong terms, has again renewed his assur ances of protection and encouragement to the trade of our nation, but he much fears he shall not be able to preserve the present good disposition if any further demand is made on account of former extortions. He encloses the account consulage collected at Bussorah from the 31st July to the 1st January, amounting to mamoodies 26,904 and 19 goz, with the Hon'ble Company's account current, the balance whereof being mamoodies 11,862 and four goz, he will wait the Chief and Council's orders how to dispose of. On close of his letter he advises that Mahomed Bashaw was appointed Bashaw of that place, whose Khya or second was just then arrived to take possession of the Government for him.' 39. The Diary of the 30th October 1728 contains the following- entry : — ' They (the Chief in Council at Gombroon) enclose copy of the last Bussorah general (letter) to Gombroon, and of Mr. Stanyan's letter to the British traders at Bussorah, enclosing the Sultan's order to that Bashaw for complying w;ith the terms stipulated with that Government on Mr. Houssage's first arrival, which Mr. French accordingly delivered to the Bashaw; but it referring to the capitulations which neither of them had, he said he could not comply with regard to the customs until he heard further from Court, whereupon Mr. French addressed the Ambassador by an express, acquaint ing him therewith. * The Ist.1G PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I, COMTY. 40. The following is an extract from the Surat Diary for the 9th December 1728: — ' Imported the Fame frigate and Fort St. George galley from Surat. By the Fame we received letters from Bussorah and Gombroon, dated the 12th and Slst October. The former advises in substance what the Resident had before wrote to Gombroon, copy of which was sent us by the Fort St. George galley, and further that, in the month of August last, the Government seized upon his linguist and put him in irons on pretence that he had taken upon himself to act as trustee to a deceased Armenian's estate without an order, as usual, from the Gauzy. Mr. French, thinking himself affronted in the person of his servant, thought fit to resent it by retiring with the rest of the English on board the Brittannia, where he had not been long before the Captain Bashaw sent him word that his servant was released, and desired he would come ashore to receive him, but he insisted on his being delivered up aboard, which was accordingly done, and the Captain Bashaw sent his second to invite him to his house. Mr. French then went ashore, and the Bashaw gave him assurances of all the favor and protection he could desire, and a phirmaund, that in case any of our servants for the future commit any crimes we shall have the liberty of punishing them ourselves, and when any disputes shall arise about debts or contracts with the country people the Gauzy shall examine the affair in presence of our Resident, and in case he (the Resident) shall think the sentence not equitable it shall not bind till the Bashaw, upon a fair hearing, confirms it: so this affair ended much to our advantage. He advises further that the boats from Bagdad not being arrived at the date of his letter, he fears he shall not be able to despatch the Brittannia before the 1st December, but hopes to obtain a very considerable freight for her before that time, and that late advices from Aleppo say that war is likely to break out in Europe, as the King of Spain had renewed his preten sions to Gibraltar and Port Mahon, supported therein by the Enperors of France and Russia, and that the Dutch seem inclinable to stand neuter.' 41. In the Diary for the 21st November 1731 allusion is made to a letter having been writen on that day by the Bombay Government to the Chief and factors at Goombroon, and the substance of that com munication is at the same time given. The following extract therefrom relates to the Company's affairs at Bussorah :— ' The phirmaund obtained by Mr. French from the Bashaw of Bussorah for the English paying only 3 per cent, customs on all goods sold at that port will be highly advantageous to private trade ; and as he has been at so large an expense in obtaining it purely out of regard to the public good, we are willing to grant him all the relief we can, and we direct them to order him to open a head on the Bussorah books of charges in procuring a phirmaund in favor of the English trade, debiting it for the whole amount of the expense, with the growing interest thereon ; and in that expense let be included three thousand crus as a gratuity for Mr. French's trouble, and let him credit the said account by account consulage for the consulage annually collected until the prinicipal and interest is paid; by this means the debt contracted for procuring the phirmaund becomes the Company's, and for their re-imbursement we direct an additional duty of 1 per cent, be laid on all trade carried on by the English to the Port of Bussorah, as well by the Company as private persons trading under their protection, until the said sum in principal and interest thereon, according to the custom of the place, is fully cleared, and no longer.' 42. On the 30th August 1733 the Agent in Council at Gombroon informed the Bombay Government that they had just received a letter from the Resident at Bussorah containing the following intelligence :— ' The Grand Vizier had defeated Thomas Caun near Bagdad, and killed 50,000 men on the spot; that the engagement lasted with great fury several hours, and that the troops Thomas Caun left to blockade Bagdad were almost all cut off by a sally made from the town by Ahmed Bashaw, a small parly excepted, with their General, Mahomed Caun Bullouch; and that the Vizier had sent a Bashaw with a deachment of horse to pursue Thomas Caun as far as Ahmadoon, and there to stay until further orders. About a month before this news came, they had, they say, received Thomas Caun's answer to Mr. Holmes' remonstrance and the Agent's letter, couched in very complaisant terms, in which he sent an order to the Shawbunder and supravisors toWITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 184-6. 17 desist from their demands of the arrears of customs; and told them as soon as he had taken Bagdad, he would grant our gentlemen a renewal of all their ancient privileges. They moreover advise us that they had ordered Mr. Geekie, in case the Turks should march to Ispahan, to retire to Gombroon with all the Company's ragoms, books, papers, and valuable moveables, but not to quit the city until they were sure of their being near. The troubles at Bussorah occasioned by the neighbourhood of the Persian Army has, they say, prevented a bale of goods being landed out of any of the ships, so that there will be little or no consulage this season.' 43. The Agent in Council at Gombroon in a further letter, dated the 20th September 1734, stated that in their last advices from the Resident at Bussorah they had been informed that— ' Thomas Caun, after making a magnificent entry into that city (spreadings being laid in the same manner as for the king), gave audience to a Turkish Envoy, and pre sented him with a callat and two hundred tomans in money, which minister, on his taking leave, publicly declared that the Grand Seignior would never consent to a peace unless Shaw Thomas was again set upon the throne. Thomas Caun made answer that he designed it, and had already sent for him, but he only ordered the king should be removed from Mazandroon to another palace.' 44. The following entry occurs in the Diary of the Bombay Government for the 6th October 1735 :— ' The Persia advices, received by the Robert, are now read, which gives us a very melancholy account of the state of affairs in that kingdom ; and as the gentlemen by remaining on shore would have more immediately exposed themselves to the resentment of Thomas Caun, and they might have also been surprised when the prisoners would have insisted on such terms that we could on no account comply with, whereas by their retiring this evil will not only be prevented, but the Persians, convinced of our resolution to leave the kingdom when we can no longer remain there with credit, and the clamours of the merchants, may have such an effect as to induce Thomas Caun to believe our continuance is of service to the kingdom, and to hearken to a considerable treaty for fixing of our privileges, we think the proceeding of the gentlemen on this occasion to be prudent and well calculated to avoid the evils as well as obtain the advantages proposed. But as they are of opinion that the Persians are fully bent upon a second expedition against Bussorah, and that Thomas Caun will insist upon our assisting him by sea against the Turks, and that he will be pacified on no other terms, we are apprehensive that the Agent, arriving there in the Queen Caroline during this confused situation of our affairs, may be at a great loss how to proceed at so critical a conjuncture; and as it is possible the Queen Caroline may not yet have passed by this port in her passage to Persia, the President proposes despatching a boat in quest of her, with positive orders to Captain Wilkie to return into this road, and that copy of the Persia advices be sent to Mr. Cockell, that, being apprized of the state of affairs, his experience may furnish us with helps for giving the necessary orders on this important occasion, proposing to send him to Gombroon as soon as possible after his arrival; but should the boat not meet with the Queen Caroline, and she have proceeded on her vo _y a g e ! it will be proper to despatch a vessel to Gombroon towards the latter end of this month, with such instructions as shall then seem necessary to be given, which, being entirely agreeable to the opinion of the several members, is unanimously agreed 45. On the 9th October 1735 the Governor in Council, Bombay, wrote letters to the Presidencies of Bengal and Fort St. George, inform ing them of the unsettled state of affairs as described in the foregoing extract, and requesting, therefore, that they would not, pending further advices, despatch any ships from either of those Presidencies to Bussorah, ' ^ ie Persians/' it was observed, ' seeming resolved upon a second attempt upon it.' 46. On the 22nd October 1735 a Special Council was held by the Bombay Government for the purpose of determining upon the measures which it would be proper to adopt as regarded the Hon'ble Company's18 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. affairs at Bussorah and at the factories in the Persian Gulf with refer ence to the then unsettled state of affairs between the Persians and Turks. At this Special Council the followiiig' resolutions were passed by the Bombay Government:— ' The President acquaints the Board that, by the advices he has received from Goa, he apprehends the Queen Caroline has missed the orders that were sent for her returning hither, and consequently passed by this port in her way to Gombroon, and therefore he has desired this meeting to take into consideration the last advices from Persia, and to resolve on some proper instructions to be given the Agent, purposing also speedily to return the Prince of Wales galley with Messrs. Waters, Whitwell, and Kay to the Agent's assistance. ' We find the Persians seem bent on demanding the assistance of our shipping and men in their second enterprize against Bussorah. and we fear they will very stiffly insist on this point as the only reasonable reparation we can make them for preventing the success of their first attempt against that city. Though in Europe any power can stop the shipping of any nation in their ports, and employ them for transports, or other services, and the same not be esteemed any breach ot the peace in the party thus forced, yet we are very doubtful what may be the consequences of our making such a condescension to the Persians, since we are strictly cavitioned not to commit any act of hostility, or give any extraordinary umbrage to an European State in amity with His Britannic Majesty, as in either of these cases we apprehend our Hon ble masters charter would be greatly atfected. Besides, the Turks being a people soon irritated to extravagant revenge, they might, in the first transport of their disgust at our appear ing against them, make such seizures of our European merchants' effects in their coun try, and even treat their persons so ill, as would bring upon us a very severe resentment, and therefore we must positively forbid the Agent, &amp;c., lending our vessels to the Persians for this service on any terms. ' But if the Agent, &amp;c., in debating with the Persians on this point find that the selling them of a ship or two is the only means they have left to soften them and induce them to waive their other demands, and that it fully appears the Hon ble Company's estate and privileges in that kingdom cannot be secured on any other terms, we think, in such case, we may give them a liberty to make use of this expedient, which, however, is not without its inconveniences, and therefore they must be cautioned not to make use of this liberty but at the last extremity, and to look on it as a medium proposed to prevent a greater evil. ' As the Persians have not yet been able to remove their Ambassador's effects from Scindy, which, we understand, are very valuable, and now lie ready to be embarked for Persia, the President proposes that the galley be ordered to call in there, and that Mr. Waters be allowed to offer the transporting of the Ambassador's people and effects to Gombroon ; and as the galley will be near full of provisions for herself and the Rose, and may be able (if the Persians consent) to take in but a small part of the effects, he further offers on this extraordinary emergency, in behalf of himself and the other owners of the Robert and Jenny, that those ships, the former of which is to proceed in company with the galley, and the latter now at Hcindy, be both employed on this service if it shall be found necessary, desiring no more than Rupees 1,500 freight for each ship, which is not more than their sailing charges ; and, if from an absolute neces sity they shall be detained by the gentlemen in the Gulf, a demurrage ot Rupees 450 each per month ; and he will also empower the Agent, &amp;c., to sell one or both ot said ships to the Persians under the limitations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. ' The President is induced to offer, and we to accept of, these proposals, on considering that if Mr. Waters, &amp;c., should succeed in this point, a very considerable pledge will be secured in our own hands, and must, we think, greatly contribute towards ending our differences on more reasonable terms. Besides, as it was hoped that the Rose galley would be sent from Gombroon to Scindy on this service, should she be there, the galley and other vessels returning with her must put a better face on our affairs; and if the Agent, &amp;c., are pressed with such hard conditions that they cannot consent to, these effects will be more easily secured; and if matters should come to such an extremity, and that no good is to be done with the Persians, but that the Hon'ble Company 's effects and private concerns are seized, we think it our duty, and accordingly it is agreed, to give positive orders to the Agent, &amp;c., to take and secure not only the Ambas sador's effects, if on board our ships, but the Arab ships that are known to be nowWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 19 in the Gulf, and all other vessels belonging to Persian subjects, and in particular to make what reprisals they can on the Persian fleet, and obstruct as much as in them lies any trade from being carried on in the Gulf; and that we give the Agent, &amp;c., permission to send our vessels up to Bussorah, that if the Persians do attempt it by land, and are likely to take it, they may bring away what they can of the merchants and their eflects, by which something considerable may be earned ; and it is these consi derations which incline us to think the countenance of a ship or two more than the galley is really necessary, and it is the number of vessels, not the quality (which the Persians are not well enough acquainted with to distinguish), that will sensibly affect them, and prove advantageous to the gentlemen in their negociations.' ' We have thus considered the worst side of our affairs, but the gentlemen in their advices seem to hope that the step they have hitherto taken may cause a more favourable turn, and produce some good effect—perhaps a motion from the Persians themselves to compromise this unlucky business, and if it should so happen that it would naturally draw after it a treaty for fixing the Hon'ble Company's privileges on a better footing than they have been for some time past, to obtain which all solici tations hitherto have proved ineffectual; but this we apprehend will occasion some charge, and whether we shall in this case ascertain a quantum, or leave it to the Agent's, &amp;c., prudent management, strenuously pressing them to reduce it as low as possible, is here to be considered. We are sensible the Hon'ble Company will little care to be at any considerable expense for obtaining a confirmation of their grants while the empire is in so unsettled a state; and on the other hand, their affairs being brought into confusion by such unforeseen incidents, it cannot be expected they will at this juncture be in any manner retrieved without some expense, which we must leave to the Agent's, &amp;c., discretion, being persuaded their best endeavours will be used to reduce the same as low as possible. ' But as the unlucky affair at Bussorah (of which the private traders only reaped the advantage) first gave rise to these troubles, we think it but reasonable that the expense occasioned thereby should be repaid by the trade of that port, and therefore it is agreed that the additional duty be continued till our hon'ble masters shall be reimbursed the whole charge they have already and shall hereafter be put to on this occasion. ' Should our gentlemen succeed so far as to commence a treaty for fixing of our hon'ble masters' privileges, we apprehend that our insisting on the grant of 1,000 tomans per annum out of the customs may greatly retard, if not put an entire stop to, this good work, as we cannot suppose the Persians will consent to pay us such a sum when we are well assured the whole net customs of the place have not furnished the Royal Treasury with that sum for several years past; and we find that when Mirza Togghy was down at Gombroon, he very frankly told the gentlemen that the enjoyment of this emolument for upwards of one hundred years past has very amply compensated for any services we may now offer to put in the scale on this account, and the reason of this argument is more strongly enforced against us when the Persians plead their inability to assent to this proportion from the extraordinary calamities their country has so long suffered, and which entirely deprived them of the very advantages on which this grant is founded. We must therefore give the Agent, &amp;c., a latitude to alter this point of our demands ; and if they can prevail with the Persians to grant a reasonable moiety of the customs to be paid us directly on any freight goods brought to that port on English shipping, we think it will be obtaining a more beneficial article for our hon'ble masters than persisting so tenaciously on our old grant; and we hope this offer will be readily entertained by the Persians, as it will convince them, more than any other arguments can, that our interest and theirs are inseparable, and that, if freight offers for that port, we can never be supposed to refuse it, which at present they entertain an extreme jealousy of, and think we do not only neglect it, but influence every body to carry their goods to Bussorah ; and if our gentle men succeed in this point, and the Persians show any distrust by our continuing a Resident at Bussorah, it is agreed to permit them to recall Mr. French to convince the Persians of our sincere intentions to increase the trade of their ports. 'The remarks made by the gentlemen on Captain Roberts' proceeding to Bussorah, immediately after what had been done there, without consulting them, makes it neces sary for us now to consider how far the-Agent, &amp;c., should be empowered to act in the like emergencies. If the affairs of Persia should be again settled on any tolerable20 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. basis, we think we ought to endeavour effectually to prevent our being embroiled in troubles of the like nature again, which, as long as this war lasts between the Turks and Persians, we may continually be liable to, and therefore it is agreed that, during the contests between the two empires, we give the Agent, &amp;c., a discretional liberty to hinder all ships trading under the Hon'ble Company's protection from proceeding to Bussorah, if they shall find it necessary so to do for the preservation and security of our hon'ble masters' effects and privileges in Persia, or to prevent any detriment happening to their affairs; but they must be cautious of making use of' this liberty without an apparent necessity ; and if done with any sinister views, they must expect a severe punishment to be inflicted on the transgressor.' 47. Mr. French, Resident at Bussorah, whose name has been fre quently alluded to in a former part of this Summary, died on the 7th November 1737 ; and, in consequence of this casualty, Mr. Nathaniel Whitwell (one of the Council of the Gombroon Factory), as appears from the following- extract from the Bombay Diary for the 27th January 1738, as a temporary measure assumed charge of the Bussorah Residency:— ' Mr. Martin French died at Bussorah the 7th November, and they sent Mr. Nathaniel Whitwell to take charge of affairs there till our further orders, and enclose copy of the instructions they gave him for that purpose. There had been a general sickness at Bussorah, by which all the English gentlemen were carried off, except one Mr. Sterling, Purser of the Ponltney, who pruiently sealed up the warehouses and Mr. French's room (though one William Kenoe, a servant of the latter's, would have opposed it) till some body should arrive to take charge of the house. Mr. Dorrill being gone to Bagdad, their Surgeon, Mr. Oliphant, having been there five years, and being greatly reduced by sickness, desires we will send another to relieve him. Their gunner desires leave to come away; and their armourer being dead, they desire we will send a Bombay smith in his room.' Mr. Whitwell appears from the following extract from the Bombay Diary for the 27th February 1739 to have been subsequently confirmed by Government in the appointment of Resident at Bussorah, but no order to this effect can be traced on the records :— ' The Persia advices of the 3rd instant, extracted under the 24th, are read, together with the several letters and papers enclosed and referred to, further consideration whereof is put off till occasion offers of answering them; and the letter of Sir Everard Faulkner, the British Minister at the Porte,* to Mr. Whitwell, our Resident at Bussorah, con cerning Mr. French's affairs, is ordered to be entered after this consultation for the notice of our hon'ble masters.' 48. From the following extract from the Bombay Diary for the 20th September 1739 it appears that in July in that year Mr, Whit well made over the Bussorah Residency to Mr. Thomas Dorrill on his proceeding to Gombroon in consequence of the death of Mr. Dacres, one of the factors at that station :— ' The letter from Mr. Nathaniel Whitwell at Bussorah, received atSuratby the Robert galley, bears date the 16th July last, and confesses receipt of our commands of the 21st April last, and says that, in compliance with our intimation concerning his pre vious settlement of the deceased Mr. French's affairs, he should not have left Bus sorah before they were finished were it not for the news of Mr. John Dacres' death, which obliged him to repair to Gombroon as soon as possible; but as he should stay till the latter end of the month before his departure, he would do the best to leave them with Mr. Dorrill in such a condition as he should be at no loss to transact them. That he had taken all practicable methods for recovery of the debts due to that estate, and particularly those outstanding amongst the desert Arabs, for which he had, in August (1738), sent Mr. Dorrill to Bagdad to solicit Ahmet Bashaw's assistance, to whom a present gained admittance and his countenance for some time ; but after the recovery * Constantinople.WITH TUHKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 21 of near 20,000 telotaa in barley, dates, and wheat, he recalled the Aga he had sent down here for that purpose, which had obliged him to drop his solicitation, and recall Mr. Dorrill from Bagdad.' In May last, notwithstanding', there still remained due upwards of 30,000 telotas from the Arabs, as he found the Bashaw began to grow tired, as nothing could be done without renewing our presents, which he could not think of, as his profuseness had occasioned his extorting- large sums of money from the people under him, and reduced them to such extremities that the expense of a present to recover more from them would be on too precarious an issue. He has placed the ' expense of the present and other charges to the account of the estate, for the benefit of which they were disbursed.' 49. On the 15th January 1740 Mr. Dorrill addressed the follow ing letter to the Bombay Government. This letter was signed by Mr. Dorrill as ' Resident at Bussorah' :— ' Hon'ble Sir and Sirs,—The Fame not being to touch at Gombroon occasions my troubling Your Honor in Council on a subject which I should otherwise have applied to the Agent and Council (at Gombroon) to present. When Mr. Whitwell* was here, he found the Hon'ble Company's allowance to be so far short of what would find him in common necessaries, that he frequently requested the Agent and Council to think of some measures for relieving him, and they promised to write to Your Honor, &amp;c., about it; but as I received a general letter from Gombroon, under date the 1st November, and nothing of his affair mentioned in it, I believe the gentlemen forgot to write in my behalf. The Hon'ble Company's allowance here is no more than Rupees 50 per month for diet and all other charges, whereas the single article of house-rent costs me more than that sum. A linguist and chicianit is impossible for me to be without, which cost me 45 telotas per month; and as I am frequently obliged to go to the Gov ernment, I am obliged to keep some horses, so that with the utmost frugality I am monthly at a considerable expense out of my own private fortune, which, I flatter myself, Your Honor, &amp;c., will think of relieving. Such a mark of favor would require my constant endeavours to exert myself in the most diligent attendance of my office, and I beg leave to offer assurances of my retaining a due gratitude for such an obligation, being with uncommon respect. 50. On the 14th February 1740 the Chief in Council of the Factory at Gombroon addressed a letter to the Government of Bombay recommending 1 that some increase might be made to the salary of the Resident at Bussorah (then fixed at Rupees 50 per mensem, inclusive of diet money and all other charges). The following is an extract from this letter:— 'We omitted to represent to Your Honor in Council in our last a mention made by Mr. Dacresf in his letter of March last to the Hon'ble Court of Directors concerning some addition being made to the Resident of Bussorah's allowances, which we take the liberty to assure Your Honor in Council, from our own experience, is not in any ways adequate to the unavoidable expense he must be at, especially for house-rent and servants' wages, two very heavy articles, and that really deserve some redress, if Your Honor in Council so please, and are so reasonable to be granted, that upon any other condition we would not become advocates to such a request.' No reply can be traced to Mr. DorrilPs application, nor to the above recommendation of the Chief in Council at Gombroon; but it must Bussohah, The \hth January 1740.

COMPY. either have been negatived, or been taken no notice of, since, on the 22nd August 1746 (being more than six years subsequent to the above correspondence), the Chief in Council at Gombroon again addressed the Bombay Government on the subject in a letter to the following effect: 'Mr. Grendon (the Resident at Bussorah) having complained of the impossibility of subsisting at Bussorah on the Hon'ble Company s allowance, and that settlement being on so much worse footing than any other in this kingdom, we have taken the liberty to allow him to charge his house-rent, 'cherise, and linguist wages, which we hope will meet with Your Honor in Council's approbation; but should it not, he is to reply it.' This arrangement was confirmed by the Hon ble the Court of Directors in a ^letter to the Bombay Government, dated the 25th February 1747, who observed— ' House-rent and a linguist seem reasonable to be allowed to the Resident at Bussorah: we have therefore no objection thereto.' 51. In a statement on the records of Government, framed in 1740, exhibiting the names of the covenanted servants of the Hon'ble Company on the Bombay establishment, the following gentlemen are mentioned as being then employed at Bussorah and in Persia :— At Bussorah. No. Names. Designation. Salary per annum. 1 2 Mr. Thomas Dorrill Mr. Dan vers Graves Provisional Resident ... Assistant to Resident ... £ 30 6 In Persia. No. Names. Designation.

The following is an extract from a letter addressed by the Chief in Council of the factory at Gombroon to the Bombay Government, dated the 15th January 1740 :— ' The revenues of this settlement, arising from duties collected, have never appeared so much diminished as this last season. The consulage on our books, as per account No 7 being no more than Shaees Factory eight thousand six hundred and ninety-nine and six eoz. The Bengal ships, instead of touching here as they used formerly, proceed ing directly for Bussorah, whither all the copper is now carried ; and the whole currency of trade, since this Muscat expedition has been on foot, taken that channel, though, it this King turn his army against Turkey (and war ceases with us), we may then chance to have it come back to us again; and besides, the imposition the merchants labor underWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 23 from the Turks would quickly, were there the least appearance of repose here, oblige them to come and purchase their commodities as formerly. The Bussorah troubles are reduced on our last books to a balance of two hundred and twelve thousand one hundred and sixty-seven Shahees Factory, and by what has been collected of the additional duty we may hope that head will, on the close of our present books, be cleared.' 53. On the 3rd June 1740 the same parties addressed a further letter to the Bombay Government, from whieh the following 1 is an extract:— ' Your Honors in our last were apprized of the preceding year's customs collected, and how much Bussorah duties exceeded those of the settlement, the occasion of which we would flatter ourselves was at an end, now a conclusion is had to the troubles with us by a peace with the Muscat Arabs. By a practice fallen into by almost every one of the private ships chusing a different port in the Gulph, whereby great inconveniencies are likely to accrue, as well with regard to the general concerns as to Your Honors in the point of collecting your revenues, unless you were to erect a settlement at each port and obtain new rogoms, those we had being chiefly limited to Gombroon: however, the incandid reflections which have been thrown on Your Honor's servants for exerting themselves on some of these occasions make us very careful of appearing forward in matters where the least shadow of private interest or partiality may be charged to the conduct of a public transaction.' 54. On the 1st August 1741 Mr. Dorrill, the Resident at Bussorah, addressed the following letter to the Bombay Government:— ' The Murtha Grab, being on return to Bombay, gives me an opportunity to acknowledge the receipt of Your Honor's, &amp;c., commands of the 18th April, which came to hand the 11th ultimo with the packet for His Majesty's Consul at Aleppo, and to be enclosed. It went forward the 22nd ultimo by an express ; the want of a messenger was the reason of its not going sooner, for at the time it arrived we hourly expected the Arabs to enter this place in an hostile manner, and it would not have been safe to have trusted it with anybody but one of the desert Arabs. ' When the last advices came from Aleppo, France had not entered into the war; their fleet that went to the West Indies was returned to Brest. They lost a great many men by sickness, and their ships were in a bad condition. The Bourbon and two more sunk through age, and the Admiral, the Marquis D'Antrene, died of grief. The King of Prussia has seized on the Duchy of Selesia; he has had a battle with the Germans and defeated them. The King of Great Britain was going into Germany with 30,000 men, to be paid by the Crown, viz., 12,000 English, 8,000 Hessians, 6,000 Danes, and 4,000 Hanoverians, to keep quietness till the election of an Emperor. Both Houses of Parliament have declared their resolution to stand by His Majesty in defence of the rights of the Queen of Hungary, and France, it is thought, will expose the pretensions of the Duke of Bavaria. ' I believe a war between the Turks and Persians is very near. Shaw Nadir is said to be at Tabreeze. It is wrote, both from Aleppo and Constantinople, that Bussorah is taken from Achmet Bashaw and given to Hossein Bashaw, who is the same that owes the money to Mr. Frenche's estate. The Arabs are so powerful that I do not think he will be able to come and take possession of his bashorly; and should a war with Persia begin shortly, it is probable the Persians will take the advantage of these disputes to seize on this* place, for they are levying a great many forces and building bridges of boats at Aveza, and themselves say their designs are against Bussorah. ' I have now two messengers at Aleppo. Should they bring any news of impor tance, and a conveyance offers for Bombay without touching at Gombroon, I believe Your Honor, &amp;c., will not be displeased at advices.' ' I have the honor to be, with great respect, ' Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, ' Your most faithful and obedient servant, ' (Sd.) Thomas Doeeill.' Bussoeah, The Isi August 1741. * Bussorah.24? PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 55. A portion of the Gombroon factory diary for broken periods, between the 5th August 1741 and the 22ud November 1757, is in the possession of this Government. The following entry in this diary occurs under date the 23rd February 1742 :— ' Received a letter from Mr. Dorrill' (Resident at Bussorah) 'advising the state of the country ; Ahmed Bashaw heing so entirely subdued the desert Arabs, who had rebelled, that they do not appear capable of being troublesome for some years, whereby Bussorah is very quiet. The Turks are making powerful preparations against Shaw Nadir, who all advices mention to have been twice beat by the Lasgees.' 56. On the 1st November 1743 the Chief in Council at Surat addressed a letter to the Bombay Government, from which the following is an extract:— ' By a French ship, arrived two days since at the Bar from Gombroon, there are private advices that Nadir Shaw has taken several places from the Turks, and that there are great troubles about Bagdad and Bussorah.' 57. In the Bombay diary for the 8th March 1744 the following account is given of the operations of the Persians against Bussorah to wards the close of the preceding year :— ' The Persians laid siege to Bussorah with 12,000 men, which continued from the 28th of August to the 27th of November, when it was raised by Shaw Nadir 's orders, and the army with their artillery marched away the 5th of December. Mr. Dorrill at the beginning of the troubles took what precaution he could not to have any vessels there that might assist either party, and accordingly sent away a small bri- gantine of his own, but the lascars, who were Bussorah people, obliged the Commander to return ; and, being determined they should not be of any assistance, he was ordered prisoner and confined to a tent upon the walls two days, when, from the people's in sinuations to the Zanizarees of his being in the Persian interest, and fearing a general massacre of the Europeans, he was obliged to comply, but at the same time ordered the Commander to bore holes in her bottom and make her in such a condition that if not immediately run ashore she must sink, which the Turks seeing permitted her to be brought on shore, and Mr. Dorrill was then released. But the insolence he had met with from the Mussaleem, even before this dispute, was such that, if passed without obtaining justice from the Bashaw, it will be impossible to remain without continual affronts whenever he refuses to advance loans, therefore, when the public and private concerns are wound up, he proposed retiring on board ship remonstrating the griev ances, which, if not redressed, to leave the place.' In reply, the Kesident at Bussorah was informed, on the 3rd April 1744, that if he could remain there with submitting only to a small expense, it will be preferable to do so, to withdrawing from thence. 58. The following are extracts from a despatch addressed by the Hon'ble the Court of Directors to the Chief in Council at Gombroon, under date the 15th March 1744 :— ' The situation of affairs in Persia by your last advices gives us but an indifferent prospect. In case our trade cannot be carried on without impositions in the kingdom of Persia, or duties for the time past are claimed and insisted upon, you must upon no account comply therewith, but pursue the measures laid down in our last by sending our goods to Bombay in order to be disposed of there. For Bussorah we send but two- thirds of the ^ broadcloth and the fifteen bales of longells indented for. In case Mr. Dorrill desires to be recalled from Bussorah, we direct that you appoint another Resident there in his room, and Mr. Dorrill must take his place at Gombroon.' 59. From the following extract from a letter addressed by the Chief in Council at Gombroon to the Bombay Government, dated the 10th April 1746, it appears that Mr. Dorrill was about that time suc ceeded in the appointment of Resident at Bussorah by a Mr. Grendon ' As your Honor in Council were pleased to judge Mr. Grendon a proper person to succeed to the Residency of Bussorah, we accordingly sent him there on the Rose, andWITH TURKISH ARABIA —164G TO 1840. 25 by the last advices from thence we expect Mr. Dorrill in a short time, who was taken up in settling his affairs.' The same letter contained the following intellig-ence :— ' Our last letters from up-country advise of Shaw Nadir's return from Callat, and that he had appointed all his Governors to meet him at Teheran, a place ahout ten days from Ispahan, from whence he intended to go against the Turks with an army of two hundred men. During his stay at Ispahan he treated our Resident as civil as could be expected from the tyrannical disposition he was in the time he was there, but we believe it was owing to the help of a present amounting to Shahees 70,169-9, which could not be avoided without running the risk of his resentment.' 60. The following is an entry in the diary of the Gombroon factory, under date the 10th July 1745 :— ' By Dutch Shotters received two letters from Mr. Thomas Dorrill at Bussorah, dated the 1st March, and the other, the 21st April (1745); the former setting forth the ill- treatment he had met with from the Government, who had even attempted his life, and the demands they had made on him for payment of Mr. Frenches debts to the country creditors by orders they had obtained from the Bashaw, for which they seized a large parcel of goods belonging to the Bombay gentlemen, and embarked them on board the galleys for Bagdad, which prevented his first resolution of going to Bouchier; for, had the goods been carried where the creditors were inhabitants, it would be impossible ever to have recovered them, and, by remaining at Bussorah, could not have obtained justice, which obliged him to set out for Bagdad, or must have submitted to the paying Mamoodies 166,005-4-0 goz, the amount of Mr. Frenche's debts to the country people. Desires orders how to act in case of fresh oppressions, and promises frugality in conducting his present complaint to the Bashaw. The above letter advises of his return from Bagdad and kind treatment he met with from the Bashaw, who, on his complaint, turned out the Mussaleem, and sequestered the effects of those that were of his Council, and had appointed Yahia Aga again the Governor of that place.' 61. On the 21st July 1746 Mr. Grendon, the Resident at Bussorah, addressed a letter to the Agent in Council at Gombroon— ' stating that the Arabs had latterly given a great deal of trouble to the country round about Bussorah,' and that the ' Kiah Bashaw was gone against them, which had occasioned the roads being stopped,' and that no caffilas could in consequence pass.' 62. In a further letter dated the October 1746, Mr. Grendon informed the A^ent in Council at Gombroon that the Kiah Bashaw had had some intention of proceeding to Bussorah, but finding ' Achmet Bashaw ' averse to it, had sent for the people of consequence to attend him, and, after receiving large presents, had set out for Bagdad. In the same letter Mr. Grendon stated peace had been concluded ' between the Turks and Persians/' 63. On the 6th April 1747 Mr. Grendon, the Resident at Bussorah, addressed a letter to the Agent in Council at Gombroon, in which, amongst other information, he stated that a new Governor had just been appointed to Bussorah, and that Achmet Bashaw had sent orders to his Mussaleem to make a new measurement of all the fruit gardens— ' in order to oppress the Arabs in their tax, whereupon, thinking themselves already too highly imposed upon, the tribe, called Monteficks, are rebelled, and to secure themselves and to the Turks all the detriment in their power, they have opened the banks of the river, which has laid the desert quite under water, to the very walls at Bussorah ; this accident has put the inhabitants into the greatest consternation, being now apprehensive lest the disagreeable stench arising from it should cause a pestilential fever.' 64. In the same letter Mr. Grendon stated that, if the Agent in Council at Gombroon approved of his doing so, he purposed, in order to escape the calamity occasioned by this inundation, to remove for a time either to Bagdad, Bushire, Karrack, or Bunderick. In reply, however, he2G PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY, was informed that the Agent in Council at Gombroon could on no account consent to his leaving Bussorah ; that of late years the desert had, on several occasions, been overflowed, but that this circumstance had never been considered a sufficient cause ' for a step of that nature.' On the 10th June 1747 Mr. Grendon addressed a further letter to the Agent in Council at Gombroon on the subject of this inundation, from which the following is an extract:— ' These three days past the north-west winds have blown exceeding hard, which have increased the waters around the city to that height, as to raise fears of this Government for the safety of the walls, to secure which they yesterday caused public notice to be given to all the inhabitants of all degrees (except the Europeans) to give their attend ance and help for three successive days, conformable to which the whole town is now out; yet notwithstanding this early precaution, the walls in several places are sapped by the weight of waters, and three bastions are fallen in; however, I believe no further ill- consequences will ensue to the city; but when the waters are almost all dried up, what may then happen to the inhabitants God only knows, but already the poorer part begin to grow sickly, as they are obliged to drink the water running off the desert, the Shatal Arab being at too great a distance, besides there is little difference between the one and the other, both being very bad.' 65. The following extracts from the Gombroon factory diary for the 1st February 1748, being the substance of a letter received from the Resident at Bussorah, dated the 7th of the preceding month, contain an account of the Dutch at Bussorah having returned to their settlement at Bouehier,* of the French having withdrawn their factory from Bussorah, and contain several items of intelligence from Turkish Arabia:— ' The Dutch at Bussorah having received an invitation from Sanlah Caun Sardar to return to their settlement at Bouchier, Mynr. Belvelt was gone again to reside there, and carried with him a quantity of sugar, sugar-candy, camphire, and some spices. Advises the departure of two large Moor's ships for Surat, and a freight ship belonging to the Portuguese for Bengal, upon whom the French Resident withdrew their concerns, and himself from Bussorah, not having received any allowance from Pondicherry these two years past. Mentions a report there was of a Bashaw's coming over the great desert which occasioned much confusion, and Solyman Kias tampering with the Arabs, who wants to carry on affairs in the same manner that his father-in-law Achmet Bashaw formerly did, and as opening the banks of the river is always pursued on these occasions, is apprehensive of another pestilential disease, which, he fears, will be attended with the utmost bad consequence. In a postscript he advises of having received letters from Bagdad, and that the Grand Seignior had appointed Hadjee Achmet Bashaw Governor of Bussorah. Cour Vizier is to have Bagdad, and Solyman Kia, Audeen. Their Bashaw was expected in a few days, having been detained some months at Bagdad on account of the death of Nadir Shaw, to whom he was going Ambassador. He has appointed the Captain Bashaw his deputy till his arrival, which has given the greatest content to the Arabs, who have suffered so long under the arbitrary measures of Achmet Bashaw and his son-in-law, so there is no doubt but the country will soon be in tranquillity.' 66. The following extract from the same diary gives from a letter from the Resident at Bussorah, dated the 13th March 1748, an account of 'an emeute which a short time before had taken place at Bagdad:— ' There has lately been great disturbances at Bagdad, occasioned by the new Bashaw Cour Vizier's cutting off the heads of twelve of the principal zanysarees, and ordering their bodies to be exposed in the public streets, which so incensed the several Chambers of them that they immediately rose in arms, and seized the principal magazine, out of which they took ten field-pieces, and planted them against the Serai, and began to fire warmly at it, which soon obliged the Bashaw to retire on the other side the * Bushire.WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. •27 river, which did not pacify the enraged mob until they had levelled the house with the ground. The Bashaw still remains out of the city, and the Government in the hands of him appointed for Bussorah, until they receive advices from Constantinople.' 67. From the following further extract from this diary for the 20th June and 7th July 1748, it appears that in the former month Mr. Grendon, upon his own authority, made over charge of the Bussorah Residency to Mr. Nathaniel Pompet, and proceeded to Bombay on private affairs;— 'Last night' (19th June 1748) ' the Agent (at Gombroon) received a private letter from Mr. Thomas Grendon, Resident at Bussorah, advising that the Success galley had been at that port from Bengal; sold her cargo by auction, and upon despatch tor Bombay, and that he was come to a resolution of reparing to Bombay upon said ship, in order for which he had delivered over charge of the Hon'ble Company's alfairs to Mr. Nathaniel Pompet, writer, and of which receiving no public advices surprises us greatly, and that he should take a step of this nature without first obtaining orders from his superiors, especially as he writes—Hossein Bashaw has arrived within a few days of Bussorah, being made Governor of that place, where his presence would have been necessary to solicit payment of what he is indebted to the estate of Mr. Martin Frenche.' 7th June 1748.—' Arrived a small trankey from Bussorah, despatched by Mr. Nathaniel Pompet. Mr, Pompet acknowledges his having received from Mr. Grendon charge of the Hon'ble Company's woollen goods and balance of their cost, &amp;c.' 68. In a letter dated the 12th August 1749 the Resident at Bussorah (Mr. Pompet) communicated the following intelligence to the Bombay Government:— ' Our Bashaw, since I wrote Your Worship, &amp;c., has gained an immense victory over the Bashaw of Bagdad, who, together with the Arabs, attacked him unawares ; however, he has killed and taken prisoners upwards of 12,000 people, together with the Bashaw of Bagdad, Kia Bashaw Aga, with two other Generals, which news has quite put a turn to affairs here, so I hope in a short time more to inform your Worship, &amp;c., of trade flourishing here as before, all manner of impositions being laid aside. On the 28th ultimo sailed the Prince Edward for Bombay with a small freight. She has made the greatest sales that ever was known to be made at this port,* which good news, together with that of a general peace, will, 1 hope, make the Bengalees think oi again reviving their trade to this* place.' In a further letter, dated the 31st December 1749, the Resident com municated the following additional intelligence :— ' By this messenger (from Aleppo) I have also received advices from Constantinople and Aleppo, &amp;c., wherein I am informed that Solyman Bashaw is certainly confirmed in the three Governments I before mentioned to Your Worship, &amp;c., so that I doubt not but now everything will go well here, though the present Captain Bashaw bits not yet delivered up this Government agreeable to Solyman Bashaw's orders; but it is impossible he can hold it out long, as the above-mentioned has now an army ot upwards of 40,000 men, and is shortly expected down here, when it is very certain numbers of worthless heads will be chopped off.' In a subsequent letter, dated the 20th March 1750, the Resident reported the arrival at Bussorah, on the 22nd of the preceding month, of Solyman Bashaw, and that the Captain Bashaw had made over the Government to him. The following is an extract from this letter :— ' I have now the pleasure to inform Your Worship in Council that on the 22nd ultimo arrived Solyman Bashaw's Mussaleem, to whom the Captain Bashaw delivered up the Government without any molestation, and retired to his old station at Monoy, though it is thought that Solyman Bashaw, who is now become the acting man in all these28 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. parts, will never put up with the many insults and affronts committed by him to his harem during his absence, though at present everything goes very well here, and trade begins to flourish as before. On this occasion I must be obliged to make Solyman Bashaw, his Kia, &amp;c., a present on account of our hon'ble employers, which has always been customary, aui nothing more than what every private merchant in Mussorah is obliged to perform, concerning which I now beg leave to assure your orship, &amp;c., the utmost frugality imaginable shall be used.' 69. In a letter to the Government of Bombay, dated the 6th March 1750, the Court o£ Directors observed— ' Mr. Nathaniel Pompet having behaved well during the time he has had the charge of Bussorah Residency, we recommend it to you to continue him in that station so long as he discharges the duty thereof faithfully and with diligence. It is absolutely necessary, in case of his death or absence, a covenanted servant should be on the spot to take care of our effects; a proper person must be accordingly sent for that purpose, and to assist Mr. Pompet in carrying on our business at Bussorah.' From the following extract, however, from a letter addressed by the Bombay Government to the Agent in Council at Gombroon, dated the 8th December 1750, it appears that Mr. Pompet, after having performed the duties of Resident from June 1748, was removed from that office, and was succeeded by Mr. Brabazon Ellis:— 'We have appointed Mr. Brabazon Ellis (who now takes his passage on this ship) to be Resident at Bussorah; also Mr. John Holmes, writer, his Assistant, who proceeds with him. Mr. Ellis commenced a junior merchant the 23rd February 1749, and Mr. Holmes a writer, the 10th June last, and have both received their salary up to the 1st July last (1/50), inclusive of diet money to the end of November, with the usual allowances for their passage. Mr. Pompet must return to the Residency by the first opportunity. In this extract no cause is assigned for the removal of Mr. Pompet, and nothing on the subject can be traced on the records further than w T hat is contained in the following extract from a despatch from the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, dated the 4th March 1752 :— ' You acquaint us in your address by the Boscamen that Mr. Pompet, in charge of Bussorah Residency, having misbehaved with respect to the Government and other wise, was recalled to Bombay without mentioning, as you ought to have done, in what his misbehaviour consisted.' 70. The following are extracts from two lists of the Hon'ble Company's covenanted servants at Bombay and factories subordinate thereto (in 1750 and 1751), with the time of their arrival in India, and at what salaries; likewise their salaries, ages, and employments at the date of the return :— 1750.

In a despatch, dated the 6th April 1752, the Hon'ble the Court of Directors communicated to the Bombay Government their approval in the following instance of Mr. Ellis's proceedings while Resident at Bushire:— ' Mr. Ellis, our Resident at Bussorah, has behaved extremely well in refusing a loan of money to the Mussaleem, and in representing to Solyman Bashaw the contin ued obstructions, impositions, and affronts he met with on this occasion, in which manner as to procure ample and satisfactory redress. In a subsequent despatch, dated the 14th March 1753, the Hon'ble Court made the following' further remark regarding Mr. Ellis : In our letter of the 6th April last we took notice of the good conduct of Mr. Ellis our Kesident at Bussorah: his behaviour since appears to be very satisfactory and' therefore we recommend it to you to continue him in that station, or as you shall find he deserves. 72. In the diary of the Gombroon factory for the 1st June 1749 the Resident at the followinar allusion is made to a letter having been received from Bussorah, dated intelligence:— the 20th April preceding. containing ' Th at the contest between the kings, it was expected, would be shortly decided • that Ibrahim Shaw was at Tabareez, and by his conduct seemed to follow the steps of his uncle Nadir Shaw. Their Bashaw was within two days of Bagdad : it was said one Iryache Jladjee Mahomed, formerly grand vizier, was arrived there, with six thousand soldiers, as Governor, which, if true, the Bashaw's affairs appear bad. It was reported if he should not have agreeable news from Court, he will enter the place sword in hand • he was confirmed one year longer Governor of Bussorah, which, it was hoped, would make him think it his interest to leave off his daily impositions. That the Government had again insisted upon a further loan, but that, agreeable to our orders, he (the Ilesi- dent at Bussorah) had struck his flag, acquainting them of his intentions of leaving the place, which occasioned their desisting. The Kia sending several of the principal people to invite his stay, promising no further molestation, and he hoped affairs would go on better, and was then on better terms than the Dutch. He had addressed the Bashaw concerning the affairs.' 73. On the 3rd November 1751 the Resident at Bussorah (Mr. Ellis) addressed a letter to the Agent in Council, Gombroon, from which the following is an extract:— ' My last respects informed your Worship in Council of the necessity I had been under of representing to Solyman Bashaw the Mussaleem's violent measures and extra ordinary behaviour towards me, to which the Bashaw's answers have been extremely sahsfactory and obliging; and his reprimand to the Mussaleem thereon so very effectual that the business of this factory has been since carried on without the least hindrance or molestation.'30 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 74. The following entry occurs in the Gombroon diary, under date 30th March 1752 ' One of the Armenian freighters on board the Don Carlos having acquainted the Captain that he intended to land his goods here (Gombroon), we sent to let the Sultan know, that according to an ancient agreement between us and the Persians one-third of the customs exacted on the goods of such persons as freighted on our ships for Bussorah belonged to the Hon'ble Company, which he consented very readily to allow, after having enquired and found the truth of the said agreement, which was entered in the Custom House registers according to form.' 75. On the 30th March 1752 the Bombay Government addressed a letter to the Agent in Council at Gombroon, containing the following instructions : — ' We must again repeat our orders for your sending us copies and translates of all the Hon'ble Company's grants and privileges in the kingdom of Persia. You must likewise direct Mr. Ellis to transmit you copies and translates of all those at Bussorah, which must likewise be forwarded hither.' Consequent on the receipt of this letter, the Agent in Council at Gombroon, on the 19th May 1752, addressed a communication to the Resi dent at Bussorah, from which the following is an extract:— ' We have nothing more to trouble you with at this time than to let you know that the Hon'ble President in Council (Bombay) would have translates of all grants and rogoms made into English (and be transmitted to Bombay), which have for many years past been obtained in their favor from the Turkish Government.' This call was repeated by the Agent in Council at Gombroon on the 26th June and 27th October 1753. In reply, the Resident at Bussorah, in a letter dated the 2nd February 1754, stated that an application had been made some time before by his predecessor to Constantinople for these documents, and that, on receipt, he would forward them on to Gombroon. The records, however, afford no information whether these documents were ever forwarded to Government. 76. In a letter dated the 15th September 1752, the Resident at Bussorah communicated to the Agent in Council at Gombroon the follow ing information in regard to the then state of affairs in Turkish Arabia :— ' For some time past this country has been in perfect tranquillity; the Arabs kept under due restraint; grain of all kinds been very cheap; the merchants of the city unmolested, and the place in general in a more quiet state than for many years before; but a chokadar is lately arrived with letters from the Bashaw, signifying his nomination of another Mussaleem, who, from the character of a headstrong and oppres sive temper, it is universally feared will occasion much confusion an&lt;l discontent. He is to leave Bagdad, we are told, the 17th current, and will be here the latter end of the month, when a present, as customary, will be expected; but I humbly beg 3 r ou will rest assured that the utmost frugality shall be used on that and all like occasions.' 77. In a letter, from which the following is an extract, dated the 20th March 1753, the Bombay Government informed the Agent in Council at Gombroon that they had appointed Mr. William Shaw, then in Bombay, to relieve Mr. Ellis in the charge of the Bussorah Residency:— ' Mr. William Shaw proceeds in the Hose to relieve Mr. Brabazon Ellis at Bussorah, to whom you must send the usual orders for delivering over the charge of the factory.' On receipt of the information, the Agent in Council at Gombroon addressed a letter, dated the 26th June 1753, to Mr. Ellis, from which the following is an extract:— ' The Hon'ble President in Council having thought proper to appoint Mr. William Shaw to succeed you in the Presidency of Bussorah, we now direct that, by the firstWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846, 31 convenient opportunity that offers for your going to the Presidency (or Surat), you deli ver over to him the charge of the Hon'ble Company's affairs with all books and papers relating thereto ; also what cash goods or other effects may remain with you belonging to them; and likewise you are to give him an insight into the Hon'ble Company's business at that place, with the forms of the country, government, and whatever else is requisite to be known ; and in delivering over the charge to Mr. William Shaw there must be an inventory taken of all the Hon'ble Company's effects, and signed by you both, copy of which must be transmitted to us. It must also be observed that during your stay all public papers and accounts are to be signed by you jointly. Accompanying is duplicate of our last, bearing date the 26th of April, and a packet directed to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, which is to be forwarded by way of Allepo, recom mended, as usual to His Majesty's Consul here.' 78. The following letter was on the same day addressed to Mr. Shaw by the Ag-ent in Council at Gombroon :— ' As the Hon'ble President in Council of Bombay have been pleased to appoint you to succeed Mr. Brabazon Ellis for transacting the Hon'ble Company's affairs at Bussorah, we have directed him to deliver over the charge thereof to you (when any convenient opportunity offer for his return to Bombay), with all books, papers, &amp;c., relating thereto; also what cash, woollen goods, or other effects may remain in his hands belonging to the Hon'ble Company, of which an exact inventory must be made and signed by you both. When you have taken charge of Bussorah Besidency, whatever goods belonging to the Hon'ble Company are remaining in warehouse are recommended to your particular care; and as our hon'ble masters are very desirous to augment the consumption of the British manufacture in all parts whereunto their commerce extends, you must be extremely careful to give them necessary advices from time to time of what sortments may be proper for the Bussorah market, which it is neces sary to remark are those that will go off the soonest and in the greatest quanti ties ; for you may be assured the Court of Directors will at all times be better pleased to hear of a large and quick vend of their goods for ready money, though the price be moderate, than with a long account of remains in warehouse when advantageous sales might have been made, and a fresh supply also have been indented for. it is almost needless to advise you against entering into disputes with the Government when there is any possibility of avoiding them, because it is a thing so contrary to your own as well as the Company's interest that any person of common consideration must, of course, be as averse to it as ourselves. We are likewise to acquaint you that the Hon'ble Company will admit of no excuse for lending their money to the Government, or selling their goods to them, without first receiving the amount; as by this method of dealing they are sure to sustain no loss from bad debts. The accompanying packet you are to deliver to Mr. Ellis on your arrival at Bussorah.' 79. On the 21st August 1753 Mr. Shaw reported his arrival at Bussorah, and that he had on the same day received charge of that Residency from Mr. Ellis. On the 23rd April 1754 the Agent in Council at Gombroon informed Mr. Shaw that Mr. Robert Garden had been appointed his assistant in succession to Mr. Holmes, who was directed, on being relieved, to proceed to Bombay. On the 17th July 1754 the Resident reported the arrival of Mr. Garden at Bussorah, but Mr. Holmes having some private affairs to settle at Bussorah did not proceed to Bombay until February 1755. 80. In a letter dated the 23rd March 1754 the Resident at Bussorah reported that the former Dutch Resident had been endeavouring to obtain permission from the Bashaw to re-establish a factory at Bussorah, that the Bashaw at first seemed inclined to comply with his application, but that the inhabitants were so inveterate against the former (Dutch) Resident, threatening to desert the place if permission were given for his return, that the Bashaw refused to accede to his request. 81. On the 30th July 1754 the Resident at Bussorah informed the Agent in Council at Gombroon that, in the early part of that month, he32 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. had received a gratifying- proof of the respect and attachment enter tained by Solyman* Bashaw for the British nation, who had deputed one of the principal officers of his household to the Resident, with presents, accompanied by assurances of his esteem. The following is an extract from Mr. Shaw's report on this subject:— ' About twenty days past I was surprised with a very singular instance ^ of Solyman Bashaw's respect and regard for the English, he having despatched hither a very principal officer of his household purposely to salute me in his name, who arrived after a passage of thirty-five days, and hy him sent me a fine Turkish sabre, with a very noble horse, richly caparisoned with gilt furniture, with very extraordinary letters cu compliments from the Bashaw, his Kia (or First Minister), and Cuzenedar, or Master ot the Household and Shawbunder, &amp;c., expressing the particular satisfaction they received from the regular decent conduct of our nation at all times in the Bashaw s Govern ment and therein expressed their readiness, not only to confirm all former grants and favours, but even to add to them, if need were, as they found at all times made so proper a use thereof as to render us daily deserving of additional instances ot their particular affection and esteem. Accordingly on the other officer s arrival, I was sent for by the Mussalleem to the Seray or Divan, and there before a numerous assembly publicly complimented by the Mussalleem and Bashaw's officers in their master s name in which they took occasion to set forth his attachment to the nation in general, and particular esteem (as they were pleased to term it) for me, which was accompanied with an invitation to Court in the Bashaws name, that thereby desiring a personal acquaintance to confirm our friendship, and that he might daily have occasion (as they were pleased to express themselves) of showing this peculiar regard and esteem, to answer which, as it deserved, I failed not to muster all the little rhetoric I was master of, and after several mutual assurances of friendship and regard I took my leave when the Bashaw's horse was presented to me to mount, and next day the officer who brought him came to visit me in form when I was necessi tated to present him with a fur coat, being informed that such was the custom observed among the Turkish courtiers (for there never having been a former instance of the kind to anv European here I could not find any precedent to go by) It will likewise I am informed, be further needful to present him with something handsome on his departure, all which I hope I have your liberty of charging to the Hon ble Company's account, as it is the custom at all other places on such public occasions. 82. In a letter to the Bombay Government, dated the 8th August 1755, the Agent in Council at Gombroon reported ' that one Monsieur Padree had arrived at Bussorah to remain there in quality of French .Resident. ' 83. On the 10th October 1755 the following instructions were communicated by Government to the Agent for all affairs of the British Nation, &amp;c., in Council, at Gombroom ' You must direct Mr. Shaw (the Resident at Bussorah) to be very watchful of Monsieur Padree's transactions at Bussorah, and that he omit no opportunity of acauaintine the Hon'ble Court of Directors and you of anything concerning him worthy notice, imagining he is sent at this critical juncture principally to forward intelligence to Europe.' 84. In a letter dated the 16th March 1756 the Resident, Mr. Shaw, gave an account of an insult that he had received a short time before from a boatman on the Bussorah river, who had threatened to strike him, and stated that on his applying to the Mussaleem for redress, he had declined doing so, and had endeavoured to incite the whole population at Bussorah against him. Mr. Shaw further stated that a disturbance had in consequence taken place, and that he had had a nanow escape of his lifej * Pasha at Bagdad.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 33 that he had represented the whole affair to the Bashaw at Bagdad and solicited redress, but in consequence of the Mussaleera having-, in order to justify himself with the Bashaw, written a false account of the trans action to Bagdad, he (Mr. Shaw) had been unsuccessful in obtaining redress from the Bashaw, who believing the account he had received from the Mussaleem informed Mr. Shaw that he considered that his conduct had been very blameable, but that from a feeling of friendship to the British Government he would overlook it. Mr. Shaw made several further representations to the Bashaw, informing him that the Mussaleem had sent him a false account, but to each representation he received a simi lar reply. Mr. Shaw therefore at last proceeded to Bagdad and sought an interview with the Bashaw, which having been granted he verbally communicated the whole particulars to His Highness, who removed the Mussaleem, and issued orders to his successor to banish and otherwise punish all persons who had been insolent to Mr. Shaw. The Bashaw at the same time issued a phirmanah in which he directed that all possible honor and regard should be paid to the interest and credit of the British nation, and declared that the least breach of that order would be attended with immediate loss of life and estate. 85. In a letter dated the 25th May 1756 the Agent in Council at Gombroon informed Mr. Shaw that on examining his accounts up to the 31st July 1755 they had discovered ' an extraordinary charge of two tomans per month allowed to Mr. Garden as Assist ant to the Resident.' Ihe surprise of the Agent in Council was expressed at this un authorized charge, and Mr. Shaw was directed to re-credit the Hon'ble ( ompany with the amount, and was at the same time cautioned against hereafter ' bringing to account any expenses without permission from the Agent in Council.' In reply, Mr. Shaw on the 23rd July 1756 submitted the following explanation:— v T e ' ex . am i n i n S this Residency's accounts for last year I can find no such errors as Your Worship, &amp;c., mentions. Regarding Mr. Garden's diet money, you will please to observe I bave allowed him only Rupees 30 per month for six months, as is customary for all writers; but on Mr. Holmer's departure he became then entitled to the usual two tomans per month and servants' wages, always allowed the Assistant here, so that there is no surplus charged, that is for the first six months Rupees 30, and lor the last six months (after Mr. Holmer's departure) two tomans per month, but nothing surplus as Assistant.' 86. On the 20th October 1756 Mr. Shaw reported that upon his application to the Bashaw of Bagdad he had lately sent him a phirman to take off the heavy charges of presents in all ships anchoring at Bussorah, which Mr. Shaw stated was 'on small 900, and on large 1,500 Cruz a ship.' This concession, Mr. Shaw stated, would, he hoped, here- after induce many vessels to proceed to Bussorah which previously, in fT avo id this charge, had proceeded no higher up the Persian Gulf than Muscat, Gombroon, or Bushire, and which, Mr. Shaw added, ' will, 1 hope, in time considerably increase the Hon'ble Company's duties at this port' (Bussorah). E34 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 87. On the 14th March 1757 the Government of Bombay addressed a further letter to the Agent for all affairs of the British Nation in the Gulf of Persia, from which the following is an extract ' You are to enquire of the Resident at Bussorah by what authority he solicited a phinnan of the Bashaw at Bagdad for taking off the charge of anchorage at that port, as we find it has obliged him to put the Hon'ble Company to the expense of a large present, which he is not able to reimburse them without collecting the same duU- the Government have hitherto done of all English ships trading thither; though, if the Resident finds the phirman is complied with, we permit of his charging the duty till the expense he has incurred is defrayed. Copy of the paragraphs which passed between you and the Resident respecting his representation of Mr. Francis Woods settling at Bunderick lias been transmitted for the Hon'ble Company's inspec tion. As Mr. Wood was plundered of the provisions and necessaries he had provided for his subsistence by the Government driving him from Bunderick, we have thought it but reasonable to compensate that loss, and being satisfied lie only received Rupees 4,000 notwithstanding the Resident at Bussorah having debted him for Rupees 6,000, we have discharged the balance of his account with your Agency, and you are to reprimand the Resident of Bussorah for debting him for the amount of his letter of credit before he knew it was in any shape complied with as a very indiscreet and irregular transaction. We have deferred coming to a resolution to resettle a factory at Bunderick till we are able to send proper vessels into the Gulf to countenance and support such an undertaking, and which the situation of our affairs at this juncture will not admit of. Having taken into consideration the Resident at Bussorah's letter and protest relative to Mr. Abraham Gee's conduct during the late troubles at that place, with that gentleman's reply, his and Captain Ninian Lowis's protest against Mr. Shaw* we have not found that Mr. Gee was culpable, but think that his giving a certificate jointly with Messrs. Scott and Baldrick to the Mussaleem at Bussorah was receding from a neutrality and tending to prejudice Mr. Shaw with that Government, and being sensible of the ill-effects of the Bengal gentlemen endeavouring to evade any dependency on the Hon'ble Company's Resident there, as Mr. Baldrick did in the year 1754 (though we don't think Mr. Gee has been at all to blame in this particu lar), we would have you empower the Resident to pievent any application being made to the Government, but through him for whose notice we forward copy of Mr Gee's reply, &amp;c., papers delivered us in his justification. The accompanying packet for the Hon'ble the Court of Directors contains the agreeable account of the English forces having retaken Calcutta on the 2nd February, which you are therefore to forward in the most expeditious manner, and advice them of all material occurrences under your inspection.' 88. In a letter to the address of the Hon'ble the Court of Direc tors, dated the 18th April 1759, the Resident at Bussorah stated that the French Resident at that place had a short time since proceeded to Bagdad and had obtained a phirman from Solyman Bashaw directing that henceforth he (the French Resident) should ' be first received on the ceremonial visits and be respected as first of the European Residents.' In consequence of his having obtained this phirman, the French Resi dent, after his return to Bussorah, treated Mr. Shaw with indignity, and issued an order that all the great men of the place and also the merchants (particularly Christians) should on all public days visit him previous to their paying their respects to the British Resident. This order was resisted by the parties to whom it was addressed, who stated that they felt a preference for the English, and that their inclinations led them to pay their first visit on these occasions to the British Resident. Mr. Shaw accordingly represented this circumstance to Solyman Bashaw, who in consequence sent an order to the Mussaleem at Bussorah— ' directing him and all his officers to regard the English as first in his esteem. The Bashaw at the same time addressed a letter to the French Resident at Bussorah repri- * Formerly Resident at Bussorah.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —164G TO 1846. 35 manding him for the above order. The Bashaw also addressed a letter to Mr. Shaw expressing his concern at the Frenchman's impudence,' and inviting him to pay him a visit at Bagdad, in order that he might have an opportunity of rendering ' his superior regard and esteem for the English nation public to the world.' Mr. Shaw excused himself from accepting this invitation on the plea that the Hon'ble Company s affairs prevented his leaving Bussorah at that period. 89. Shortly afterwards, however, Solyman Bashaw sent another pressing invitation to Air. Shaw to visit him at Bagdad, and having sent this invite by some special messengers, who had been ordered to escort Mr. Shaw to Bagdad, he deemed it advisable to accept the invitation, and accordingly proceeded to Bagdad, where, on his arrival on the 15th June 1759, he was received with marks of favour and distinction. During Mr. Shaw's stay at Bagdad the Bashaw granted him a general phir- man confirming all the rights and privileges previously enjoyed by the ' English.' The following is an extract from Mr. Shaw's report on this subject;— ' My last address waited Your Worshipful in Council by Captain Price of the Swal low, since which time, at the repeated invitations of Solyman Bashaw, I have made a trip to Bagdad, which I would gladly have excused; but he having sent down a particular favorite of his to invite me, and after him another, and all the friends and well-wishers of our nation, both officers and merchants at Bagdad, writing me more pressingly to accept the Bashaw's invitation, whom they represented as inclined to do me every favour I could demand, whereas on the reverse, a refusal must need disgust him, as he had sent his particular favorite to invite and attend me up, and had even fitted up a house and garden at Bagdad, and furnished it for my reception, and had sent orders both to all the Turkish and Arab Governors and Shaiks in the way to treat me with singular respect. This being the case, and the Bashaw and Kia repeating the most pressing instances by letters one after another to see me a day sooner, and all the well- wishers of our nation here (as well as at Oagdad as above mentioned) pressing me to accept of this invitation, and at the same time receiving advices from my Attorney at Hossein Bashaw's Court that without the immediate interposition of Solyman Bashaw nothing could be recovered, and that other creditors were eating up the remains of his fortune by phirman from Stambole, &amp;c., presents to his officers; I say, this being the case, and considering that the heats being fairly set in, I had little hopes to clear the warehouses of the Hon'ble Company's woollens before the approach of the cold weather, and as to despatches I was there in the way to forward them with more care and expedition, whether to or from Europe, I was at last prevailed on to set out, attended by the officer whom the Bashaw had sent to invite me, and 1 happily arrived at Bagdad the latter end of June, where, as well as by all the officers in the way, the most extraordinary marks of favour and distinction were shown me; and to do honor to our nation, the Bashaw repeatedly on the way sent me letters of welcome, and on my near approach ordered many of his officers of the greatest distinction, and also of the troops and janizarees, to attend me in my entrance into that city, and by his daily invitation and compliments, each day exceeding another, was I detained till the middle of August, and in short had such public honors and favours conferred on me as has rejoiced the friends, and confounded the enemies, of our nation, particularly the French, the ill-behaviour of whose Resident here was in some respect the original cause of this invitation, as Your Worshipful, &amp;c., will see by copy of my address to the Hon'ble Company under date the 18th April last, to which I beg leave to refer you as the letter book for last year goes enclosed. The Bashaw has favoured me with a general phirman confirming all the rights and privileges enjoyed by the English, even in Stambole, by which means our private trade will be cleared of many impositions here, and no further shawbuudees or other fees to be collected of the shipping, which amounts to between three and four hundred Cruzrais for every ship, great or small, no further marbar charges, nor uctosobs (a large duty for exporting goods up-country), and this for ever excludes the ships' presents, and further enables to send over cloth up to Bagdad (should the Hon'ble Company at any time choose it) custom free, or to supply the merchants there on the same terms as we do at Bussorab, the risque only to be36 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. theirs, and the customs which from hence to Bagdad on woollens will turn out to them about 13 per cent. We shall by this means free them of using the same method as we do in India, the risque to be theirs; but we to deliver them free of all charges and customs at Bagdad, which will, to be sure, extend our woollen trade considerably there, and I hope entirely overset the Alleppo trade to that place, which I found was still considerable on my arrival there, and I have accordingly now sold (100) one hundred bales of coarse cloth at 7-4 mamodies per guz, and (30) thirty bales fine cloth at 17 mamodies per guz, to be cleared in four months from my arrival here, in which case to allow a discount of six per cent., and if in six months, three per cent., and if longer delayed, to be resold publicly on the proprietors' account and risque. The Bashaw on my departure from Bagdad expressed the highest marks of content in this visit, and honored me with very extraordinary compliments. He even favoured me with his own row galley and two others to attend here, and here we were received by the Governor in a singularly honorable manner, who is a new man, the Bashaw having thought proper to change the late one.' 90. The phirman alluded to in the above extract was to the following' effect:— ' To the Chief of the Siads, Tons, and Freeholders, our Aga, the Mussaleem of Busso- rah for the time being (whose state God increase). Be it known unto you that my commands are as follow —In the city of our Great Sultan, called Bussorah, there is an English Balias or Chief of the merchants, &amp;c.; his nation being in peace with our high Port (whose grandeur God continue everlastingly), therefore there is in his hands the high and respectable capitulations of our lofty Port to which all submission must be paid, and it behoves all men to obey the orders therein contained : Therefore in the manner that it is commanded and ordered in said high capitulations, article by article, whether regarding the customs, and all things relative thereto, or whether regarding other matters, or whether the respecting, favouring, assisting, and protecting the said English Balias and his effects agreeable to the said high capitulations, you must, as ordered by our Great Sultan, in all things conform and pay obedience thereto. And you must not in any the least respect depart from, or act contrary to, said respected capitula tion. And this our Bourally or order I send you for this purpose, when it arrives you. Be it known unto you, that it is by us directed that, conformable to said high capitula tions which are the commands of our Great Sultan the English Balias, you are to aid, assist, and protect, and in all other respects you are to pay obedience thereto, and from the letter of said high capitulations you must not in any respect depart. And agree able to this our order or Bourally you are commanded to act.' 91. Mr. Shaw remained at Bagdad from the 15th June to the latter end of August (1759), when he returned to Bussorah, and reached that place the middle of September, ' where ^ (Mr. Shaw stated in a letter he wrote to the Hon^ble the Court of Directors on the 27th of the following month)— ' I have the pleasure to find the Government entirely inclined to favour us; the merchants and citizens seem also entirely attached to us, as well from the favour they find we are in with the Bashaw, as upon account of several grievances they formerly laboured under, which I have had the good fortune to get redressed by means of Your Honors' influence with our Bashaw.' 92. In a letter to the Agent in Council at Gombroon, dated the 26th August 1760, Mr. Shaw stated that the Bashaw had a short time ♦ A. D. 1759.WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1G46 TO 1846. 37 before issued an order for the payment at Bussorah of a duty of five per cent, on all European goods landed at that place. Mr. Shaw, however, subsequently succeeded in inducing the Bashaw to relinquish this demand. The following is an extract from Mr. Shaw's report on this subject:— ' A very extraordinary affair which happened a few days after the Swallows arrival has unfortunately been the means of detaining her thus long, which was a demand made by the Bashaw for five per cent, on all European goods, which they pretend is in consequence of an order from Shambole, but I rather imagine, owing to the multi plicity of European ships arrived, and expected here this season, and his great scarcity of ready money at this juncture, which has occasioned him to change his Kia,* and depose and plunder several of his other considerable officers of late. However, the case is, he first wrote down hither to his Mussaleem, and soon after backed it with a public order to demand the above five per cent; but the Mussaleem, who is a prudent man, and much our friend in particular, instead of publishing the same, sent privately for me, and acquainted me therewith, and at the same time advised me forthwith to write to the Bashaw of Bagdad about it, and that he would on his part keep the thing a secret here, and represented the evil consequence of a proceeding so discrelitable to the Europeans, who would all rather leave the place (by which its trade would be entirely ruined) than agree to any innovations of this nature; and as they had actually proceeded so far at Bagdad as to cause several goods belonging to the Lnglish, French, and Venetian gentlemen of Aleppo there to pay the said five per cent, even under the care of Europeans. He advised me in a friendly manner to detain the Swallow here, purposely on that account that he might thereon ground an agreement to his master for retracting this order, as he would urge that 1 detained this Company's fighting vessels here purposely to carry their flag and their effects away, in case the five per cent, was insisted on. I accordingly wrote to the Bashaw regarding it, when a proposal was made to my Attorney at Bagdad of finishing it for a present, which 1 rejected as a bad precedent, and insisted on the English capitulations, whereupon they desired them to be produced, which I did accordingly, and yesterday I have advices from my attorney at Baghdad that they were resolved to drop the aff.ir and countermand their former orders, it being only the effect of this new Kia's enmity to the Christians in general.' 93. From the following- extract from a despatch addressed by Mr. Shaw on the 30th August 1760 to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, it appears that about that time the Agent in Council at Gombroon appointed Mr. Shaw the Resident at Bussorah, and his Assistant,, Mr. Garden :— 'to act jointly with the Resident in the management of the Hon'ble Company's affairs. Under date the 23rd instant, Mr. Shaw paid his respects to Your Honors' duplicate of which is enclosed, also triplicate of the address which preceded it, and on the 17th June came to hand the enclosed packet from Gombroon by the Lively Ketch, when the Agent in Council were pleased to appoint Mr. Robert Garden to act jointly with the Resident in the management of Your Honors' affairs here, as he has 'some time commenced factor, in the discharge of which trust he begs leave to assure Your Honors ol his fidelity, and that it shall be his study at all times to convince you thereof) by his assiduity and steady attachment to the Hon'ble Company's interest.' 94. In a despatch from the Hon'ble the Court of Directors to the Bombay Government, dated the 25th April 1760, that authority com plained of apparent inattention on the part of Mr. Shaw in forwardino- to them overland intelligence in regard to their affairs in India, &amp;c. The following is an extract from this despatch :— ' We have hitherto had a very good opinion of Mr. William Shaw, our Resident at Bussorah : we esteemed him a deserving servant that would merit our favour, and accordingly at the request of his friends we indulged him with the option of the Resi- deuce of Scindy if he preferred it to Bussorah. But as the important channel for overland advices is almost lost, and we very seldom hear from this gentleman, we * Minister.38 PKECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. have strone reason to believe him remiss and negligent in this essential part of his dutv and therefore if our suspicions are well grounded, and he is really culpable, we direct vou to remove him from Bussorah, and we also in such case revoke our orders to his favour respecting the Residence of Scindy, and whoever in future is appointed to Bussorah. will keep a watchful eye over his conduct and if he ever fails m a punctual correspondence with us, or yourselves, or is ever found to delay advices to and from India, call him immediately to Bombay, for early advices may prove otthe greatest con sequence to our affairs, in time of war especially.' It does not appear what orders were issued by Government on receipt of the above despatch ; but in a letter addressed to Government by the Agent in Council at Gombroon, dated the 9th April 1761, it was observed : « In obedience to your commands, the Agent (Mr. Douglas) now proceeds to Bussorah, and on his return we shall fully answer every point of your orders. 95. The last letter which can be traced in the records from Messrs. Shaw and Garden from Bussorah is dated the 4th May 1761,about which time Mr. DouMas (the Agent at Gombroon) must have arrived at Bus sorah. On the 30th July 1761 a letter was addressed to the Bombay Gov ernment by Mr. Douglas and a Mr. James Stuart (who had accompanied Mr Douglas to Bussorah) as being jointly in charge of the Hon'ble Company's affairs at Bussorah in supersession to Mr. Shaw and Mr. Garden 'who had been removed. In this letter it was stated that Mr. Douglas and Mr. Stuart were examining the accounts of Messrs. Shaw and ^Garden that by their own admission they were indebted to the Hon'ble Company the sum of Tomans 12,317-79-0 (about Rupees 61,585), and that they had no present effects to meet this debt. In this letter it was observed:— « As there is so large a deficiency of cash, we have acquainted Mr. Garden that we cannot admit of his acting, or being any ways conceraed in the management ot the Hon'ble Company's affairs, until your Honor in Council s pleasure is known on that head.' This letter also contained the following intelligence ' Sheik Solvman, a subject of the Bashaw of Baghdad, having of late been guilty of many enormities, the Bashaw ordered the Mussaleem of the place to assemble the forces of the Arab Shaiks. as well as what troops he had, and go against said bhaik Solvman, in consequence of which the Mussaleen, after having received a reinforce ment from Baghdad, set out last month on the expedition, but ere he proceeded, he nressed us in a verv strenuous manner to let the Swallow give countenance to the Bashaw's affairs by joining fourteen of his armed trankeys, and endeavour tohlock un Durach River, in which were some armed boats of Shaik bolyman s; this we consented to as we were given to understand it would certainly ingratiate us in the Bashaw's esteem, and would be a certain means, should we have any favours hereafter to ask of o-ettino- them obtained. Upon the whole we were in hopes it might prove of service to our Hon'ble masters' affairs, which induced us to comply, and she is now off Durach River.' 96. Mr. Douglas left Bussorah on the 17th October 1761, leaving Mr. James Stuart in charge of that Residency, and returned to Gom broon for the purpose of resuming his duties as Agent at that place. 97. On the 3rd February 1762, Mr. Shaw addressed the following letter te Government in explanation of his past proceedings at Bussorah which had occasioned his removal from the situation of Resident ' From the Agency (Gombroon) Your Honor, &amp;c., have been doubtless informed, that fhp unhappy Situation of my affairs would not permit me to follow my inclination of returning by the Swallow to the Presidency, and from Mr. Garden's and my addressWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 39 to the Agency by that vessel, under the 19th October, and the several papers therein referred to. Your Honor, &amp;c., will please to observe how greatly I think myself aggrieved by the conduct of the Right Worshipful the Agent during his stay here, and equally so by his leaving this place, at a juncture, when I might in a few days have been enabled by his stay, and a proper assistance, to settle the contractor's accounts, and recover and pay in the large balance due to the Hon'ble Company. ' I shall not here pretend to vindicate my own conduct in giving the contractor's cloth upon trust, otherwise than by saying it had ever been practised by my pre decessors, and self, with success ; and 1 humbly presume to add, no evil consequences would now have attended it had I been properly supported and countenanced by Mr. Douglas. By whom on the reverse many impediments were thrown in my way in that and all my other affairs, which are fully set forth in several letters wrote him whilst here, and more particularly in that addressed to him alone, of the 9th October last, and as all those letters and papers are to be sure sent from the Agency for the inspection of your Honor's Board, I shall not here trouble you by enlarging thereon, but must take the liberty to say, that his rendering it apparent here, by his conduct, that from him I had neither favour nor countenance to expect. His attempts to set the Bashaw of Baghdad against me, as mentioned in my said letter of the 19th October, and his giving out here that I had nothing but the most rigorous resentment to look for from Your Honour and Council, has so much impaired my credit, that 1 have not been hitherto able to come to any settlement with Hadjee Eusuph, who has so large a sum in his hands due for the Hon'ble Company's cloth ; and my own private affairs are still, if possible, in a more desperate condition for the same reasons, which are unhappily much in the hands of the Government, and people depending on them, with whom I have neither power nor credit left, being out of post and unbefriended here, I therefore take the liberty to represent my unfortunate situation, and the improbability I have to settle (without giving up my all to ruin) with Hadjee Eusuph and others ; he from his own interest here and the countenance procured him by Mr. Douglas at our factory, and his own evasions, has till now protracted the re-adjusting of his accounts; re-adjusting I say, because we had really adjusted them but a few days before the Swallow's arrival, which was public to all the world, as it took up several days, yet now he raises such numerous objections, and adds so many fresh demands, and insists upon re-adjusting all our old accounts from the year 1758, that there is likely to be no end to it, without the immediate interposi tion of Your Honor, &lt;fec. I therefore request you will please to think of some method such as to Your Hon'ble Board shall seem meet to procure the settlement of this and all my affairs here, and re-establish my credit in consideration of the post I have filled, which will lay me under the highest obligation. As my stay is attended with so great an expense of time and money, and I am sensible my character also greatly suffers for want of being in person at the Presidency to vindicate myself as far as possible, I am persuaded Your Honor, &amp;c., will never permit a Company's servant of near eighteen years' standing to be thus given up to ruin and discredit in the place he once bore some station without affording him proper relief. Even though in some respects his conduct may have been judged censurable, and in this confidence it is I make this my humble appli cation, and I beg leave to subscribe myself with all deference and respect.' 98. Iii a letter to Government^ dated 9th July 1762, the Ag-ent in Council at Gombroon reported the death on the 14th May preeedino- of Solyman Bashaw of Bagdad; that messengers had been despatched to Constantinople with news of that event, and that their return was hourly expected with the Sultan's appointment of a new Bashaw or Bashaws, it being, it was observed, the prevailing opinion of many intelligent persons that Bagdad and Bussorah would for the future be formed into two distinct Governments under different Bashaws, indepen dent of each other. This expectation, however, was not realised. Ali Aga having in July 1762 been appointed Bashaw of Bagdad and Bussorah. 99. On the 21st July 1762, Mr. James Stuart, who had been placed by Mr. Douglas in the month of October preceding in tempo rary charge of the Bussorah Residency, died suddenly. On receiving40 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. intelligence of this event, Mr. Douglas, on the 11th August 1762, sent Mr. Dymoke Lyster, one of the Council of the Factory of Gombroon, to Bussorah, with instructions to conduct the manag-ement of the Com pany's affairs at that place, until a successor to Mr. Stuart had been appointed by the Bombay Government. On receiving- this intelligence, Government appointed Mr. William Andrew Price, then in Bombay, ' Provisional Agent of Persia/' and directed him to proceed forthwith to Bussorah. Orders were at the same time issued for the removal of the Gombroon Factory to Bussorah. The following are extracts from the letter addressed by the Bombay Government on this occasion to Mr. Price, dated the 22nd January 1768, containing instructions for his guidance. These extracts also contain detailed information in regard to the reasons which had induced Government to direct the removal of Messrs. Shaw and Garden from the management of the Company's affairs at Bussorah :— ' The conduct of Mr. William Shaw, late Resident at Bussorah, having rendered it necessary to order an enquiry into the situation of our Hon'ble masters' affairs there to be set on foot, a Committee of the Board was appointed for this purpose under date the 13th February 1761, and in consequence of their report laid before us on the 27th of the same month, we deemed Mr. Shaw so highly culpable in the detention of the Drake and Swallow contrary to our express orders, that we resolved to remove him immediately from the management of affairs there, and appointed Mr. James Stuart to be his successor therein; but as our Hon'ble masters had severely censured Mr. Shaw's conduct in respect to the transmitting overland advices, and ordered an enquiry to be made into the cause of their miscarriage, which, as well as the necessity of his journey to Bagdad, could only be properly done upon the spot, we ordered Mr. Alexander Douglas to proceed to Bussorah to make the necessary enquiry into these points, and to acquaint us with the result. Messrs. Douglas and Stuart accord- ingly proceeded to, and arrived at, Bussorah on the 14th May 1761, and acquainted us, under date the 13th July following, that the balance due on their arrival from Messrs. Shaw and Garden to our Hon'ble masters was Tomans 15,078-25-50, in part of which those gentlemen had to that time made good the sum of Tomans 2,760-46-40, and were then indebted Tomans 12,317-79-10, and which by advices since received, we find has been reduced to Tomans 11,807-2-10, and which by letters and accounts hitherto come to hand appears to be the balance due from Messrs. Shaw and Garden at this time. Affairs being thus circumstanced at Bussorah, and Mr. William Shaw having represented that the only means of enabling him and Mr. Garden to discharge this very large debt to the Hon'ble Company was to afford him proper countenance and support in adjusting his outstanding concerns there, we have determined that you shall proceed to Bussorah to endeavour to recover the said debt, and to afford Mr. William Shaw all the countenance and assistance in adjusting his concerns which the influence of the British flag may be able to afford him; also to take charge of our Hon'ble masters' afl'airs at Bussorah, until your presence may be no longer necessary for adjusting Mr. Shaw's concerns, or until further orders from us. You are accord ingly invested with the President's commission for these purposes, and Mr. Benjamin Jervis (who now proceeds), and Mr. Dymoke Lyster already there, are as factors to assist you in the management of affairs, agreeably to the rules of the service, and for your better carrying our intentions into execution. ' Mr. Douglas having on his arrival at Bussorah suspended Mr. Robert Garden from acting in the Hon'ble Company's affairs there on account of the large balance of cash due to our Hon'ble masters, which we have since confirmed, he must continue in the same situation until his and Mr. Shaw's affairs are finally adjusted, but he must be present at all examinations, wherein he may be in the least concerned, and be permitted to urge whatever he may deem necessary in his own defence. ' Our Hon'ble masters having been pleased, in their commands of the 16th April last, to recommend to our consideration the removing of the Agency from (lombroon to Bussorah, we have determined thereon, and agreeable to their commands now give Mr. Douglas the option of being Agent, but as Mr. Shaw has through the whole of his correspondence taxed that gentleman in such a manner, as if just, renders him by noWITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 41 means a proper person to be concerned in the adjustment of Mr. Shaw's affairs, or in the enquiry you are ordered to make into some points of his conduct, and as his being As;ent while these affairs are depending, might give room for Mr. Shaw to allege hereafter that his influence and the countenance and support he has all along shown to Hadjee Eusuph in prejudice to him, was an insurmountable obstacle to the settling his affairs and setting his conduct in a clear and just light to us. We have determined that you shall take charge of our Hon'ble masters' aflairs at Bussorah immediately on your arrival, and continue to manage the same, until your presence may be no longer necessary for settling Mr. Shaw's affairs, or until further orders from hence; but as Mr. Douglas may accompany you to Bussorah to produce such proofs, as he may judge necessary on the spot, for vindicating his character from the aspersions thrown upon it by Mr. William Shaw (for which purpose we now send him attested copies of the several charges laid against him by that gentleman;, you are to behave to him in a polite and friendly manner, and afford him all the accommodation which his rank and station in the service entitle him to, affording him at the same time all the assistance he may require of you, in order to clear himself of the imputations laid to his charge, either by examining witnesses, or by your interposition with the Govern ment or others for procuring such proofs as Mr. Douglas may represent to be necessary for that purpose, and the same conduct you will observe with respect to Messrs. Shaw and Garden. Messrs. Benjamin Jervis and John Portesse now proceed to your assistance, having received their diet to the end of last month, salary to the 2nd instant, but not the allowance for their passage. Messrs. Dymoke Lyster and John Sebastian Natler, already in Persia, are likewise ordered to assist you agreeably to the rules ot the service, but as Mr. Portesse is only ordered to accompany you, on account of his bad state of health, he is not to be concerned in the management of affairs, notwithstanding his being a factor, but only to assist you, as you may see occasion, and to return with you to the Presidency. You are to embark on the Tartar, whose commander is ordered to receive and entertain you in a manner suitable to your rank and station in the service, and to proceed on her to Bussorah with all expedition, to set about the enquiries ordered, carrying with you as many of the Hon'ble Company's woollens, as you may be able, touching however at Muscat for intelligence, and at Gombroon to give any assistance which may be wanted there, which you are to afford on Mr. Douglas' applying to you for the same, provided it may not require above a few days. While you are employed on this service, we permit of your keeping a table at the Hon'ble Company's expense, in part of which you have been advanced four thousand (4,000) rupees, and directed that at Bussorah everybody live in one house (if it can be done), eat at one table, and in every respect keep up a perfect harmony; and as presents to the Government will be necessary on your first arrival, and, perhaps, too, on any applications you may have occa sion to make, we must acquiesce therein, though at the same time we must enjoin you to the utmost frugality in this, as well as in every article of expense whatever, avoid ing as much as you can all pomp and parade of any kind, which is constantly attended with a very heavy charge to our Hon'ble masters.' 100. On the 26th January 1763, Mr. Price left Bombay for Gom broon and Bussorah, and arrived in Gombroon roads on the 24th March following. In his journal of proceedings, Mr. Price gives the following account of his arrival at Gombroon;— ' 24th March. At night anchored in Gombroon road, but notwithstanding the vessel fired several guns, and burnt a number of blue-lights; they were none of them answered.' 25th March. Not any vessels in the road, nor appearance of any colours on shore, which makes me conclude the Pactory is withdrawn ; but as no boats are come off to us (although it is now ten o'clock), that it has not been done without some hostilities, and as I am greatly embarrassed for want of intelligence, ordered a Dutch ensign to be hoisted, and a gun fired, this had the effect I wished for, for shortly after the Governor sent off a boat to invite us on shore ; in this boat came one of the Pactory servants. Prom him I learnt that the English had taken and burnt Gombroon Port, and pillaged the town ; that Mr. Douglas afterwards proceeded to Lofton Kishme with the Europe ship Drake to attack the Jiahmanny, but had retired without attempt ing her, and made the best of his way to Bombay. Under these circumstances I was apprehensive that Moollah Ally Shaw would not permit of our having a Pilot, neverthe less as the vessels going without the island, instead of between Kishme and the Main, might make a material difference in her passage, resolved to attempt it, weighed anchor accordingly, and proceeded to Kishme, making the usual signal for a Pilot. In about42 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. half an hour I was agreeably surprized by a boat coming on board, from Moollah Ally Shaw, with a present of fowls, almonds, &amp;c., and a I'ilot who conducted us between Kishme and the Main with great skill and safety, of which I gave him a certificate. As we approached the Persian ship, she politely hoisted her colours.' 101. Mr. Price arrived at Bussorab on the 13th May 1763, having' on his way, in conformity with instructions furnished to him by Govern ment on his leaving- Bombay, called at Bushire, and concluded an agree ment with the Sheik for the establishment by the East India Company of a factory at that place. Mr. Price, in a despatch to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, dated the 18th May 1763, gives the following- account of his proceedings on his first arrival at Bussorah :— ' I an-ived here on the 13th instant, but on account of the change of the Mussaleem, who came down from Baghdad three days since, and this morning only made his entry into town, it has hitherto prevented the manner of my reception being settled, which as affairs are now circumstanced is a very material point, for, from the enquiry I have made, I find it will be necessary to carry things with a high hand, more especially in regard to the present Mussaleem, who has the character of an haughty, imperious man, and a mortal enemy to Christians, so that I have reason to believe my negocia- tions with him will be attended with difficulty and obstruction.' On the same day that the despatch from which this extract is taken was written, Mr. Price landed at Bussorah, the Captain Bashaw Mufti and ' Shaw Bunder' having come to meet him. 102. The result of Mr. Price's investigation into the conduct of Messrs. Shaw and Garden satisfied Government that those gentlemen had not, as had been previously believed to be the case, been guilty of dishonesty towards the Hon'ble Company in their transactions at Bus sorah. The following extract from a letter addressed by the Bombay Government on the 24th January 1764 to Mr. Price, and to Mr. Dymoke Lyster, who had assisted the former gentlemen in this enquiry, contains the decision of Government on this subject:— 'We shall now proceed to reply to the several letters received from the Agent (Mr. Price) since his arrival at lUissorah, and give you such orders and directions as appear to us necessary in consequence thereof, as he (Mr. Price) represents he com mitted no acts of hostility, and we suppose no interruption was given to the trade of the 1 orte. e approve of the measures he pursued on his arrival (at Bussorah) in not going to town till some previous measures were settled with the Government, and though it affords us the utmost satisfaction to find it put out of dispute, that Hadjee Eusuph is really indebted on account of woollens the sum of Tomans 11,674-53-24, and that Mr. Price is possessed of his obligation for the same; yet we must still look upon Messrs. Shaw and Garden as responsible for the balance of Tomans 11,807-2-10 due to our Hon'ble masters on the 24th March 1762, nor does it in our opinion the least exculpate those gentlemen for being guilty of a breach of orders in delivering woollens upon trust, although it clears them from the suspicion which from the cash account might have been entertained of their having appropriated that amount to their own use, and which has induced us unanimously to agree to take off the bar to Mr. Shaw s coming into Council, and to admit him to a seat therein, conformable to his standing, submitting his conduct as to delivering woollens upon trust contrary to orders, and the consequence which may ensue therefrom, to the determination of the Hon ble Company, to whom a full and impartial account of these transactions will be transmitted as soon as we receive the necessary particulars from Mr. Price. Mr. Shaw must therefore hold himself in readiness for repairing to the Presidency accordingly whenever he may think proper, though as his presence at Bussorah may be essentially necessary for procuring payment of the above money from Hadjee Eusuph, by which alone there seems to be any prospect of his being enabled to discharge the above balance due from him and Mr. Garden, we think it behoves him m such case to stay till it is cleared. For the same reason which has induced us to be so favourable to Mr. Shaw, we have agreed to take off Mr. Garden's suspension,WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 43 and restore him to the service until our Hon'ble masters pleasure can be known regarding him, and as Mr. Price represents he may he serviceable in their attairs at Bussorah, we permit of his continuing to ju;t in his station there, but we cannot think of confirming him as second, until his further behaviour shall induce us entirely to look over his past misconduct, and convince us he merits so great an indulgence- 103. On these proceedings however being reported to the Hon'ble Court, they directed that Mr. Shaw should be dismissed from the Hon'ble Company's service, and that Mr. Garden should no longer be employed at Bussorah. The following is an extract from the Hon'ble Court's despatch, dated the 8th November 1764, containing these orders ' Mr William Shaw having left Bussorah without any leave from his superiors at Bombay, and notwithstanding it appears he has been at Aleppo for a considerable time past he has not thought fit to write one line to inform us oi his motives for so doing, or indeed to give us any account of his proceedings, we have thought proper to dismiss him from the Company's service. You are, therefore, incase of his being at Bussorah, to signify the same to him, and at the same time to acquaint him we require his return to England forthwith, to answer for his conduct in general, which has been very unsatis factory to the Court. As Mr. Eobert Garden was joined with Mr. Shaw m the manage- ment of the Company's affairs at Bussorah, we do not think it is proper he should continue there any longer, he is therefore to return to Bombay by the first proper conveyance that oilers.' 104. Mr. Price having completed the enquiry into the conduct of Messrs. Shaw and Garden, he, in conformity with instructions he had received from Government, left Bussorah on the 14th January 1764, and returned to Bombay, leaving Mr. Dymoke Lyster in charge of the Com pany's Factory. 105. On the 12th February 1764, Mr. George Skipp was sent from Bombay to Bussorah for the purpose of keeping the factory books. The following is an extract from the letter addressed by Government to the Agent in Council at Bussorah, informing him of this arrangement:— ' The return (to Bussorah) of this vessel (the Drake Ketch) has given Mr. George Skipp, whom we have appointed to keep the books of your Settlement, an opportunity of proceeding thither accordingly; he has received his salary to the 1st ultimo (J anuary 1764), diet money for this month, and an allowance for his passage: he is to have an allowance of 20 rupees per month for keeping the books.' 106. On the 16th April 1764, Mr. Peter Elwin Wrench (then in Bombay) was appointed by Government the Ilon'ble Company s Agent for all affairs of the British nation in the Gulf of Persia, &amp;c., in Council at Bussorah. Mr. Wrench arrived at Bussorah on the 10th July 1764, and assumed charge of the Agency at that place on the following day. 107. On the 5th September 1764, the Right Hon'ble Henry Grenville, His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, addressed a letter to Mr. Wrench, informing him that His Excellency had after considerable difficulty obtained from the Sublime Porte ' a con- sulary Birat' for the English East India Company's Agent at Bussorah. The following is an extract from the Ilon'ble Mr. Grenville s letter tor- warding the Birat:— ' You will have learnt the difficulties I have had to encounter at the 1 orte, the scenes of entanglements which I found myself engaged in with the Vizier, ere 1 could work out an accomplishment of the great object in view, and obtain leave tor dispatching away an officer of distinction from the Porte, and making him the bearer of the44 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. Porte s commands to Bussorah. At length, however, I succeeded. Fortunately I have found a successful negotiator at the post, and much I hope that this officer will prove as successful a messenger of the Company's service, and for all parties interested, which -ii i Wai 1 t Wlttl ea » er im P atien ce to be informed of. From those despatches, too, you will have learnt that I was still labouring to succeed at the port in that very difficult pinch of business, so often spoken of already in my former despatches and now at length happily obtained, I mean a consulary Birat from the Porte for the Company's Agents at Bussorah. It is a real satisfaction to me thus to have it in my power in the first letter I write, and in the first opening of my correspondence with you, to congra tulate you on this event. I have all along looked upon a consulary Birat from^the Porte as an object of such a high concernment to the Company's 'interests in the Ottoman Dominions at all times, and particularly in the present hour, amidst the present distractions and irregularities of Government at Bussorah, that I determined to leave no effort unemployed which could possibly effect my success. It is the surest and most efficacious means that we know of in this part of the world for protecting the Company's commerce, their property, and just rights : it secures to them for ever, and more firmly than anything else can, a permanent and quiet residence at Bussorah for their future Agents there, it silences for ever that new fangled but dangerous doctrine of the Porte, the annual change of them.' 108. ^ The Birat, or Consular Commission above alluded to, was to the following effect:— ' We, the Right Hon'ble Henry Grenville, Ambassador to His Majesty the King of S. (treat Britain, q.t the Ottoman Porte, &amp;c., &amp;c., to all whom H. G bbntillb . these presents may concern, Greeting— ' Having judged it very proper and necessary to grant this present for the service of the Hon ble English United East India Company, as also for the better security and prosperity of their affairs in trade at Bussorah, and also when in the Ottoman Dominions, as also to secure and assure a protection to all persons in the respective Residencies of their Agents and Ministers, that fromj thenceforth there be established a Lonsul, with ample and full power, over all belonging to his charge to execute the above-mentioned. ' Be it therefore known that we, by virtue of authority granted us by Eoyal Letters 1 atent under the great seal of Great Britain and conformable to an Imperial Birat granted by the Emperor's Sublime Porte and the Sultan Mustofo, son of Sultan Ahmed, always victorious, by these presents we declare and acknowledge the illustrious Mr! Kobert Garden, the present Agent of the said Hon'ble Company (as also their future Agents), and whoever be Agent in future, and whoever be British Consul for transacting t leu anairs m the city of Bussorah or other places thereto belonging or dependent thereon, granting, however, to the said Mr. Robert Garden, or even to any who shall be Agent in future, full and ample power in all things belonging to his charge, and in this respect we order all His Britannic Majesty's subjects to acknowledge him in quality of Biitish Consul praying their Excellencies, the Hon'ble Bashaw and other officers. Ministers, and Magistrates of the Ottoman Empire, to whom these presents shall be shown, to suffer them freely to enjoy and amply and peaceably to enjoy their Consul- snip, and to aid them with their assistance, protection, and favour whenever their occasions lead them to have resource to them, conformable to the good and ancient tnendship subsisting between the Crown of Great Britain and the Sublime Porte, and conformable to the sacred capitulations. ' In faith of which we have signed these presents with our own hands, and have caused it to be countersigned by our Chief Secretary, applying thereto the Royal seal ln our of Pera, at Constantinople, this 29th August ' By Order of His Excellency, ' (Sd.) David Petebs, ' Secretary.'WITH TURKISH ARABIA—1646 TO 1846. 45 109 On the 20th April 1765 the Agent in Couneil at Bussorah addressed a letter to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors contaming the following information:— 'We have the pleasure to inform Your Honors that the town enjoya all desirable tranquillitT at present, and have therefore nothing further to advlM On that W, except that the Mussaleemship has heen lately changed in favor of Sohmam Aga, who haa been so little a time in the Government; aa yet there is no judging ol hi , 'hough he seems to be well calculated for this charge and by his professions to us in parSar we have reason to think he will prove . gorf to wh«h hp has already shown us some convincing proofs, particularly having, at the A&lt;,e request given him the preference to the French Resident in regard to the first visit at the serai when he received us with the greatest marks of friendship and distinction and frequently assures us nothing should be wanting on his part to show his regard for our nation, as^weU as to evince the good footing he desired might subsist between us on all occasions.' 110 From a Statement which is on the records of Government, it appears that on the 1st Jnly 1765 the Company's establishment at Bussorah was comprised of the undermentioned gentlemen, who received the salaries set opposite their respective names.WITH TURKISH ARABIA— IG^G TO 1846. 47 111. On receipt by the Agent in Council at Bussorah of the Hon'ble Court's order, alluded to in paragraph 103, to send Mr. garden down to Bombay, that gentleman, who a short time before had been sent to Bagdad with a representation to the Bashaw in order to eftect some sales of the Hon'ble Company's goods, was recalled and Mr Dymoke Lyster, one of the Council at Bussorah, was ordered to proceed on to Bagdad and relieve Mr. Garden. The Agent in Council at Bussorah about this time made a recommendation that for the future one ot the Hon'ble Company's servants should permanently reside at Bagdad. This arrangement was approved by Government on the 15th January 1766, and Mr. James Morley, then in Bombay, was appointed Kesident at Bagdad, where he arrived on the 2nd May following, when Mr. Dymoke Lyster returned to Bussorah. The Honble the Cour 0 Directors having, however, disapproved of this arrangement, Mr. JV oi ey was, on the 23rd November 1766, recalled by the Bombay Government from Bagdad. 112. On the 8th July 1766 the Hon'ble Company's establish ment at Bussorah was as shown in the following Statement: No. Names. Esq., 2.

On the 11th February 1767 Mr ^Henry Moore, then in Bombay, was appointed by Government to succeed Mr. Wrench, Mr. William Diggs Latouche was at the same time appointed to succeed Mr. Benjamin Hollamby as assistant, who was ordered to return to Bombay, and Mr. John Yockly Botham was appointed Secretary. These gentlemen arrived at Bussorah on the 31st March 1767, and on the following day assumed charge of their respective appointments. 114. In a despatch dated the 19th April 1767 the Agent in Coun cil at Bussorah communicated the following intelligence to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors :— ' We forward this address to Your Honors by the way of Aleppo to give cover to a packet received the 31st ultimo from the Presidency by the Eagle, at the same time to enclose a duplicate letter from this factory bearing date the 23rd ot last month. In consequence of the orders received from the Presidency by the Eagle, we now trans mit Your Honors the best accounts we can collect as to the rise of the troubles with the Shaik Shack Soliman. The Chaub is originally a subject of the Turks, and has tor many years possessed a considerable territory within their dominions bordering upon the Persian empire, for which he ought, and did tor some years, annually to pay a large sum of money into the Treasury of this Pachaship. A few years after the death ot a adir Shah, and in the troubles that followed it, he also got possession of a territory m the48 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. Persian dominions, by this means he became a subject of both powers. The territory of Gaban and its districts is the name of that he possesses on the Turkish and Durack, that in the Persian by being in possession of such large territories, and not paying the usual tribute to either power. Owing to the general decline of the Turks in these parts, and the troubles that then reigned throughout the Persian Empire, he grew in a manner independent of either, and soon became rich by possessing the whole revenue. Judging, however, that he should in time be called on by both powers for an account of the arrears due to them, he foresaw that a Marine force would be his greatest security, and accordingly by degrees raised it to the strength it is at present. Demands have been constantly made on him both by Turks and Persians for these arrears, and he as con stantly has eluded the payment of them. This disobedience and several petty robberies his people were daily committing, both by sea and land, at length brought the arms of the Turks upon him. Soliman Pacha in the year 1761 ordered his Musgaleem of this place out against them, who with a numerous army marched to Gaban from whence the Chaub tied to his fort at Durack, which is so situated as to render the coming at it a work of great time and trouble. By this he gained his ends, and by means of presents at Bagdad bought his peace with the Pacha when his fort was near falling into the hands of Ali Aga, then General of the Turkish Army. On the commencement of this war with him in the year 1761 the Government requested of Alexander Douglas, Esquire, and Mr. Stewart, the assistance of the Swallow, then here, which was accordingly judged necessary to be complied with; but the Turkish forces withdrawing the Swallow returned hither. In the latter end of the year 1763 Ali Pacha came down himself with a considerable army against him, but knowing they were not equal to the attempt by sea, as his Marine force was considerably increased since the last war, he requested William Andrew Price, Esquire, then Agent, to assist him with two vessels of Your Honors' then here, the Tartar and Swallow, which it was judged necessary should be complied with, and was accordingly done. They had several encounters with the gallivats of the Chaub, but peace being again established our vessels returned hither. In the year 1765 Currim Caun came against him, on which the Chaub fled with his gallivats to sea, and the Caun destroyed his fort at Durack yet he was not able to overcome him as he had no Marine force, he therefore contented himself with what he had done and retired from thence. The Caun had in this war requested the assistance of the Turkish galleys and forces that he might utterly destroy him, but the dilatoriness of this Government so chagrined the Caun, that after waiting a short time he retired in disgust. A very short time after the Caun was gone forces came from Bagdad, with orders to the Mussaleem to go out against him. This he accordingly did with his forces and the Captain of the Pacha's galleys, but judging their own Marine force not equal to the Chaubs, the Pacha by letter and the Mussaleem here applied to Mr. Wrench, their Agent, for the assistance of an English vessel (the only one then here) called the Fanny Snow, Captain Parkinson. And Captain Parkinson, in consequence of some stipulation with this Government made in his favour by Mr. Wrench, was prevailed on to go on this service; he accordingly went down the river and joined the Turkish galleys which were lying on this side the river with the camp of the Mussaleem, while the Chaub's forces and gallivats were opposite to them, and a few shot were some times exchanged. Your Honors' sloop was also employed on this service for the assistance of the Government, but nothing material happened on either side, and a seeming accommodation soon took place : the Mussaleem returned to town, and the Chaub retired. This was about the end of May 1765. On the 10th and 17th July the Chaub took the 'Sally ' and 'Fort William. ' Your Honors' affairs under the direction of this Agency have met with little or no alteration since the date of our last respects. Notwithstanding the endeavours of Agasy Caun, the Persian Ambassador, with the Chaub Shaik Soliman to reconcile the disputes in which this country has lately been involved, the Chaub still continues the same evasive methods in hopes to amuse us for another season, concluding it the only means he has of escaping. Agasy Caun has had a conference with him, and, as the Caun informs us, received rather insult than anything satisfactory, either with respect to the Turks or us: we have been too long amused, and we are afraid Your Honors will think so. With the hopes of bringing this Chaub to proper terms, we would willingly embrace pacific measures; but consistent with your credit, they are not in our power, your interest is our only aim. It is with the greatest reluctance, we beg leave to assure Your Honors, that we find ourselves under the necessity of applying to Carim Caun for settling the tranquillity of this Gulf; it is certainly in his power to do it. The Turks are afraid to attempt the reduction of the Chaub without the Caun's permission, and this per mission has not yet been granted.'50 PRECIS OF INFOUMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 116. Mr. Dymoke Lyster died on the 15th November 17G7, and Mr. John Beanmount was appointed by Government to succeed him. Mr. George Skipp having about this time, by order of Government, been sent from Bussorah on a mission to the King of Persia, Mr. illiam Lewis was appointed to succeed him as one of the Council at Bussorah. Both of these gentlemen reached Bussorah on the 7th April 1768; Mr. George Abraham was about the same time appointed by Government an Assistant to the Agent in Council at Bussorah. The last mentioned gentleman arrived at Bussorah on the 20th February 1768, and on the 22nd of the same month, by direction of the Agent in Council, he assumed charge of the office of Sub-Treasurer to that Factory. On the 16th August 1768 Mr. George Green, one of the Hon'ble Company's Factors at Bushire, was directed by the Agent in Council at Bussorah to proceed to the latter place and join the Bussorah Factory. On the 3rd October following Mr. Green arrived at Bussorah and took his seat as 3rd in Council. 117. On the 5th February 1768 the Pacha of Baghdad addressed the following letter to Mr. Moore, the Agent at Bussorah, intimating his appointment of a new Mussaleem or Governor for that place ;— 'I am very glad to hear that you are in good health and well, and understand all that you have said unto me about Soliman Aga, my old Mussaleem, and of the regard universally bore him in Bussorah, Fifteen days before the arrival of your letter I had appointed Abdool Rhamaun Beg to succeed Soliman Aga, and he was set out to take charge of the Government of Bussorah before your letter arrived here. Abdool Rhamaun Beg is a man of very good family, of great understanding, and will encourage the Government as well, if not better, than Soliman Aga. On this subject I have given him all the advice in my power, let who will be Mussaleem, if *they do not behave well, inform me; your business is with me, not with the Mussaleem, and if they ruin Bussorah, the misfortune is mine, not yours. I have long known the English, and have ever found them men of their work. I must desire of you to keep in friendship with Abdool Rhamaun Beg, that you and he may have but one heart, and that you will consult with, and advise, him in the same manner that you have always done with Soliman Aga. I have the highest opinion of you, and am convinced nothing will take place to occasion any difference between us. Continue your friendship to me and my new Mussaleem.' 118. In informing the Bombay Government of the above arrange ment, by which Soliman Aga was superseded in the Government of Bussorah, the Agent in Council at that place, in a letter dated the 8th March 1768, made the following remarks :— ' We are very sorry to inform Your Honor in Council that the Pacha of Bagdad has turned Soliman Aga out of the Government of Bussorah, and has appointed one Abdool Rhamaun Beg to succeed him in the Mussaleemship, such is the inconstancy of a Turkish Government, and such its destructive principles. Ismael, the new Kia or second of Bagdad, is Soliman Aga's principal enemy, envious of his superior merit, the good-will so generally bore him, and the credit he has acquired in his administration here, Ismael has wished and worked his downfall. The grand crimes objected to Soliman Aga are, the not throwing more money into the Bagdad Treasury, and the not answer ing the draughts or Booralties that are made upon the Bussorah revenues, of which he has now three from the Pacha for 25,000 Cruz. If these are crimes, they are crimes beyond the power of an honest or humane Mussaleem to remedy. Many of the Government's lands lay uncultivated owing to the heavy duties that the Mussaleem has been ordered to lay on those lands which the renters not being able to gain a subsistence from have quitted; the Chaub has long refused the paying his tribute for the lands he holds on the other side of the river, which are by much the most fertile of any in this remote part of the Turkish dominions. The Montefick Shaik, who is the principal venter of the lands around Bussorah, is now eight years in arrears with the Turkish Treasury ; and as he has the command of from 30 or 40,OOO fighting Arabs, the Turks are obliged to use him most tenderly. Commerce in generalWITH TURKISH A11AB1A— 1G46 TO 1846. 51 has been for a long time past upon the deeline, and the large caffalas which formerly were passing between Bussorah and the Persian dominions are now never heard of but in story, so that the sea import customs, trivial as they are when credited by all the unavoidable charges of Government, are considered as the grand revenue source ol Bussorah, one-half of even these, too, Soliman Aga had assigned over to the Hon'ble Company for the payment of the Government s debt to them. From revenues thus mutilated what can be expected, but they will still be less, if an oppressive Mussaleem has the management of them, and the Pacha will then, too late, be sensible of the misconduct of his administration. It is to this continual change of Government that may in a great measure be attributed the present decline of the Ottoman power: not he who best governs, but he who best can pay is the best qualified for posts of honor and of trust; of this venal system every Turkish Governor is sensible, uncertain, therefore, lest a higher bidder for 'Government may offer rapine and extortion is the almost certain consequence. Soliman Aga, however, is by general suffrage allowed an exception ; his successor, Abdool Khamaun' Beg, has taken advantage of the Pacha's avaricious disposition, and of Ismael's enmity to Soliman Aga, and has paid down 4,(H)0 Zuma- boobs to bring about this revolution. He has made many promises also to the Pacha and Ismael of the large supplies of money that they shall receive from hence, and has dazzled the whole Divan with the commercial advantage that is to accrue to Bussorah under his management from the approaching peace with the Chaub, and the strict alliance now forming with Carim Caun, by the Turkish Embassadour at the Court of Sebipas. We have thought it our duty to dwell thus long on this subject that Your Honor in Council may be as well acquainted with the constitution of this Government as is in our power to make you, and because we think it may have a use when our Honorable employers' interests at Bussorah come under your consideration. You may depend on our utmost endeavours to continue on the most friendly terms with our new Mussaleem, but we are apprehensive, from his general bad character, that we shall find the task a difficult one. Several of our most substantial merchants are determined on leaving Bussorah, and the strongest applications have been made to Bagdad for the restoration of Soliman Aga.' 119. On the 18th October 1769 the Agent in Council at Bussorah communicated the following 1 intelligence to the Honorable the Court of Directors: — ' The Turks for many months past have been engaged in a kind ot mock war with the Montifick Arabs, whereby all communication with Bagdad, whether by the Tigris or Euphrates, has been entirely stopped. This has been such a check upon all kind of trade that commerce has been long unheard of. The cause of these troubles has been Shaik Abdoolla, who is Shaik of the Montificks; his refusing to pay the Pacha the regular tribute due on account of the lands he holds of the Turks, and for which he is now many years in arrears. The Pacha, by the last accounts we received from Bagdad, was marched against Shaik Abdoolla, and it was said intended visiting Bussorah ; how true, we cannot determine. All accounts, however, agree that one Shaik Eazell had been appointed Shaik of the Montifick Arabs in the room of Abdoolla. As avarice, however, is the pole star of our Pacha, and Abdoolla is rich in treasure, we are inclined to believe their differences will be shortly terminated, and that the Pacha will return again to his capital more loaded with wealth than honors. During these disturbances sundry parties of the Montificks have taken several of the villages about Bussorah, and for some days con fined us within our walls. Our Mussaleem was very urgent with us for assistance, but we would not hear of it: the assistance given against the Chaub and its destructive consequences were sufficient warnings to us. In policy there can be nothing worse than assisting such people as the Turks ; they have no gratitude, you can gain no advantage by it, whether with respect to commerce or anything else, and by assisting them once they always think themselves entitled to assistance hereafter, it would have been parti cularly bad in the present case, because, as Shaik Abdoolla and we have ever been upon the most friendly footing, in case it had so happened that he had taken Bussorah (which, in our opinion, had he heartily set about it he might most easily have done) our neutrality might have been our preservation. What would have made the capture of Bussorah now an easy conquest is the party dissensions at present prevailing in it, and the detestation that our Mussaleem, owing to his cowardice, tyranny, and oppressions, is held in by all ranks and orders of people.' 120. In a further despatch to the Honorable Court, dated the 15th November 1769, the Agent in Council at Bussorah reported that the52 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. Pacha of Bagdad having a few days before proceeded with an army against the Montifieks to within about 300 miles of Bussorah, Mr. Moore^ the Agent, had proceeded to the Pacha's camp, when in consequence of the representations which Mr. Moore then personally made to the Pacha in regard to the tyranny of Hadjee Soliman Aga, the Mussaleem at Bussorah, His Excellency issued orders for his removal, and appointed Eusoph Aga his successor. The following is an extract from this despatch:—• ' In several of the letters from the Agency of Bussorah, since the month of November 1768, Your Honors have been advised of the injurious treatment that your servants there and the English in general have received from the Mussaleem of that place, Hadjee Soliman Aga : they repeatedly complained to the Pacha of Bagdad, but received no redress save promises. This induced your Agent and Council to resolve on an interview with him, if possible, thinking that the most prudent and effectual method of putting a stop to the tyranny of our Mussaleein and obtaining the necessary redress, they accordingly resolved on sending the Agent and Mr. Green to wait on him, and to endeavour, if possible, to effect the removal of the Mussaleem, the time taken for it was the Pacha's marching against the Montifick Arabs. As soon, therefore, ever your servants received intelligence of the Pacha's having left Bagdad, and of his being so far advanced on his march, as to be within reach of our cruizers, Mr. Moore and Mr. Green embarked on board the Expedition Cruizer, and together with the Fancy, Bomb, proceeded on their negotiation under the 31st ultimo. It was the 6th instant after sailing about 300 miles up the river that we joined the Pacha in his tents at Umlabass on the banks of the Euphrates. The two first days after our arrival were taken up in ceremonies that were unadvoidable, and on which we doubt not \ our Honors would think it needless in us to expatiate ; we will therefore only say on that head that we have been treated by the Pacha with the utmost hospitality and politeness, and that he has taken our visit to him in the respectable light in which we intended it. It is necessary here to inform Your Honors that the Mussaleem of Bussorah had joined the Pacha some days before we joined him, and had made many impressions to our disad vantage, which in consequence increased the difficulty of our negotiations. We found the Mussaleem here on our arrival, but he returned under the 8th to his Government at Bussorah, under the 12th instant. The Agent waited on the Pacha, and in a private audience with him delivered him a paper containing the grievances of which we complained; in consequence of our complaints the Pacha has this day despatched his brother, the Kia, down to Bussorah, in order to remove our Mussaleem and to place in his room one Eusoph Aga, who is generally reported to be an honest man, and an humane one. The Kia in several visits that have been paid him by the Agent has assured him that he will immediately on his arrival before Bussorah order our late Mussaleem into prison, and strip him of all his ill acquired possessions, not only by way of punishment for the several injuries that we had received, but as a terror to such as may be appointed the Governor of Bussorah in future.' 121. On the 1st January 1769 the Bussorah Agency was composed of the following gentlemen who drew the salaries set opposite their res pective names, independently of diet money and servants' wages:— o Names.

On the 22nd June 1769 the Agent at Bussorah addressed the following letter to the Pacha of Bagdad, complaining in the instances therein mentioned of the conduct previous to his removal of Hadjee Soliman Aga, the (Turkish) Governor of Bussorah :— ' I have already taken the liberty of addressing my complaints to you, not only on account of the insults which the English factory in particular have received from your present Mussaleem here, Hajee Soliman Aga, but on account of his tyrannical proceed ings relative to the Christian merchants in general. To these remonstrances, to my very great surprise, I have hitherto received neither reply nor redress. How destructive to your interests must be the continuation of Hadjee Soliman Aga at Bussorah, it is need less to point out to you. The Armenian and other Christians, you may be assured, will not continue long here; indeed, many of them would have left Bussorah some months ago had not my entreaties with them prevented it. As to justice, your Governor knows it not; his oppressions are general, nor can age or indigence be exempted from his cruelty and rapacity. I do therefore again in the most earnest manner request of Your Excellency to move Hadjee Soliman Aga, if not, you will drive us to measures that will be disagree able to both. Give me leave to support my request by relating the following circumstances which your Mussaleem has been guilty of within these seven days past:— ' ls£.—The permitting two of his servants who were attending him on horseback to strike with clubs the horse on which was a gentleman belonging to me, and who was at that time in company with me, complaint made ; no redress. ' 2ad. —The imprisoning and beating the porter of the English factory for no other reason that I know of than because he was a Christian and a servant of that factory. ' How great a violation these insults are of the most sacred treaties subsisting between the Sublime Porte and my Royal Sovereign I submit to your consideration, and in hopes of redress from you, 1 conclude myself with due respect.' 123. In reply, the Pacha in a letter to Mr. Moore, dated 10th July 1769, stated as follows :— ' You write me the causes of your complaints against my Mussaleem, Hadjee Soliman Aga, and three other persons. This is much against my inclinations, not only on your account, but on account of the friendship between your King and mine. I now write on the strongest manner to my Mussaleem on these points, and have directed him to shew you all favor and friendship ; he is likewise ordered to give you every satisfaction you can desire on account of the insults you have received at Bussorah, and you may depend you will henceforward receive greater honors than have ever hitherto been shewn you. Do not listen to every report that is made you. Depend on my friendship, and be assured of my protection.' 124. Previous, however, to the receipt of the above reply, the Mus saleem had expressed himself desirous of being for the future on a friendly footing with the Agent in Council at Bussorah, when he was informed by Mr. Moore (the Agent) that before this could be accom plished he must, without reservation, agree to the following conditions, with the whole of which he complied :— ' —That proper persons should be sent to the Agent from the Mussaleem to ask him pardon for the insult shewn him with imprisonment of one of the factory ser vants, for the several other insalts which the English have received during his Mussa- leemship, and to promise in his name a very different conduct towards us in future. 2nd. —That the Mussaleem should give us a Teskera or order on the Shah Bunder for the payment of 20,000 Cruz on account of the country merchants' property landed at the Goomrook from the Albion, Rumhald, and Drake, but that the Turkish customs on all the English property and on all the country property on board them, sold by the English, be paid by the said English into the Hon'ble Company's Treasury on account of the Government.'54 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. ' 'ird. —That the Turkish customs on the cargoes of the several other ships expected this season he thus divided. ' The 3 per cent, on till English property to be all paid to the Hon'hle Company. ' The 7 per cent, on all country property whatever, whether sold by the English or country merchants, to be equally divided between the Mussaleem and the Hon'ble Com pany, or 82- per cent, each.' 125. On the Mth August 3 769 the Pacha of Bagdad addressed the following letter to the Agent in Council at Bussorah :— ' The conduct of Shaik Abdoolla, the Montifick Shaik, having been such, I have been obliged to turn him out of that Shaikdom, and in his room have appointed Fazel Ebna Saigar the Shaik of the Montificks; in consequence I have sent him the ' Coork,' as usual, upon his appointment. The distresses of the poor have at length obliged me to quit Bagdad with almost all my forces this month of Ilebi-el Saaney. From time immemorial there has been the greatest friendship always subsisting between the several Pachas of Bagdad and the English Chiefs residing at Bussorah, at this time, if possible, that friendship is stronger than ever. Your being strangers in our country claims our kindest consideration, and we are well convinced how steady are your friendships, how ready you have ever been to assist us whenever we have had occasion for the same. It is this reliance on that friendship that induces me to request you would assist me and my Mussaleem, lladjee Soliman Aga, in our present war against the Montifick Shaik, particularly with your Council and with your ships on the river, in case my Mussaleem should find it necessarj' to apply to you for them : the affair now in question is of much greater consequence than anything that has hitherto ever passed between us, and if you will assist in it, you may be assured the favor will never be forgotten. Upon my arrival at Bussorah you may be assured I will leave nothing undone to serve and oblige you. I beg you would advise and assist my Mussaleem all in your power, and do everything that you can for my interests.' On receipt of this letter the Agent in Council resolved— ' that it would be time enough to give the Mussaleem the proper reply relative to the assistance of the Hon'ble Company's vessels against the Montifick Shaik and such like matters as soon as ever the Mussaleem was weak enough to ask it.' After agreeing to this resolution, the Agent returned (on the 29th August 1769) the following reply to the Pacha:— 'I have received Your Excellencies letter; it gave me much pleasure to understand by it that I shall soon have the honor of seeing you at Bussorah, and I hope Your Excellency will meet with every success in your present undertaking. You desire me to continue in friendship with your Mussaleem, and assist him, not only with my advice, but with our ships, if he desires them ; I have convinced him of the difficulty of such large ships as our's acting in this river, of which I doubt not he will inform you. From our first settling in your country we have always been ready to assist the Turks to the utmost of our power, and will ever continue to do so.' 126. On the 1st March 1770 the Bombay Government made the following intimation to the Agent in Council at Bussorah:— ' Our Hon'ble Masters have in their aforesaid commands, received here the 24th September last, been pleased to restore Mr. Robert Garden to his standing in the service, and as, from his prudence and knowledge of their affairs at Bussorah, we are of opinion he will be useful at your settlement, we have thought proper to appoint him second thereof, and he must take his seat at your Board accordingly, and remain con stantly on the spot to take charge in case of the death or absence of the Agent. Having appointed Mr. William Walker (Surgeon at Bussorah) Surgeon of Surat Factory, he must repair thither, and Mr. George Birat to be your Surgeon in his room. Mr. J ames Morley was also about the same time appointed an additional member of the Bussorah Agency. Mr. Garden and Mr. Morley having arrived at Bussorah joined that factory on the 5th May 1770.' 127. In a letter from the Agent in Council at Bussorah to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, dated the 11th June 1770, that authority(§) WITH TUEKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 55 was informed that the posts of that Agency were then distributed in the following manner:— No. N A M X 8.

In consequence of the plague having broken out at Bussorah the Agent in Council came to a Resolution on the 22nd April 1773, at which time the daily deaths from this disease were computed to be about 1,000, to leave Bussorah and to retire for a short period to Bombay. This Resolution was communicated to the Hon^ble the Court of Directors in a letter from the Agent in Council at Bussorah, dated the 23rd April 1773, from which the following is an extract:— ' We leave this ' (letter) 'in order to be forwarded to you by the first opportunity that offers: it is purposely to inform you that the plague having broke out in Bussorah, * Returned to Bombay on the 15th October 1770 in consequence of ill health. t Returned to Bombay in March 1771 and took his seat in Council to which he had succeeded in consequence of the death of the Governor, Mr. Hodges. % Returned to Bombay in August 1771 on account of ill health.56 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. iust after we last addressed you, which was the first of this month, the Agent and some of Your Honor's servants retired to Belvoir, about four miles from Bussorah, and the rest shut themselves up in the factory in town, hoping that in a short t ime the summer setting in would put a stop to this calamity. In the meantime the Drake and Tiger were stationed at Belvoir, and all communication was stopt with the countrypeople; the disorder since that time has continued to rage with unrelenting rigour; one thousand and upwards have been daily carried off by it, and contrary to our expecta tion, and the opinions of several here, the heat instead of checking has rather in creased it. In this calamitous situation the contagion spreading around us, even to our very doors, the provisions which we had laid in for our subsistence beginning to fall short, and no method of recruiting them without running the greatest risque at the same time of receiving the contagion, our domestics too having all left us, we have unanimously thought it the most prudent and eligible _ method, as well for the preservation of our own lives as those oi the people belonging to the two vessels, to leave the place and retire to Bombay, trom whence we can return at the opening of the season in case we hear that the disorder has ceased. Our stay here could answer no one good purpose, no business whatever can be transacted, nor would it be prudent at any rate to have any communication with the countrypeople for these six months at least; Your Honor's house no outstanding debts of any consequence, and as we have recommended the care of your factory, after having seated up the godowns, &amp;c., to the Government here, and have besides appointed Coja Petrus and Coja Miriar, two respectable Armenian merchants, your Vakeels, in our absence, we do not think your effects will run the least risque. We have concealed from the people, however, our in tention of going as far as Bombay, for whilst they are ignoiant when we shall return they will be more on their guard. Your Honors may be assured we have maturely considered this step, and that our regard to your interest, as well as to our own for tunes, which on account of outstanding debts, &amp;c., are left in a much more precarious situation than your affairs, would prevent our adopting it without we were convinced of the absolute necessity of it.' 130. In conformity with the above Resolution, the Agent in Council, consisting 1 of the gentlemen mentioned below,* left Bussorah on the same day, the four former in the Hon'ble Company's vessel Brake, and the two latter in the Tiger, The Brake arrived in the Bombay harbour on the 14th of the following month, when she was ordered to proceed to Butcher's Island to perform quarantine. Messrs. Moore, Lewis, LaTouche, and Abraham accordingly remained on Butcher's Island until the 17th June, when they were allowed to land in Bombay. 131. The Tiger, however, having on board Messrs. Beaumont and Green, was captured off the island of Ormus, in the Persian Gulf, on the 26th April, by some Bunderick Gallivats, and both of those gentlemen were taken prisoners to Shiraz, where, after being kept for some time, they were removed to Bushire. Mr. Green was released on the 2nd September 1774, and reached Bussorah on the 19th of the same month. Mr. Beaumont was detained a prisoner at Bushire until the 22nd April 1775, when he was released after a captivity of nearly two years. 132. In conformity with instructions from Government, Mr. Moore left Bombay on the 28th October 1773, on his return to Bussorah, for the purpose of resuming his duties as Agent, and was accom panied by Mr. William Digges LaTouche, Mr. George Abraham, Mr. James Collings, and Mr. Galley. These gentlemen arrived at Bussorah on * 1 Mr. Moore. 2 „ Lewis, 3 „ W. D. LaTouche. 4 5 6 Mr. G.

The total loss of life from this disease at Bussorah, and the villages around it during the period of its prevalence, was estimated at about 2,00,000, and in the whole of Turkish Arabia at two millions. 138. On his return to Bussorah Mr. Moore, the Agent, addressed the following letter to the Pacha of Bagdad (dated the 12th January 1774):— I benefit by the first conveyance that offers for Bagdad to inform Your Excellency of my return to this place under the 5th instant, and at the same time to assure you, I rejoice not a little at finding you had escaped the plague which, during the course of the last 12 months, has been inflicted on Your Excellency's dominions. Your Excellency can be no stranger to the dreadful havock it has made in this city in particular, the inhabitants almost all dead, those few that are remaining quite dispirited, and some of the principal merchants amongst them, preparing to leave your country for ever, they are induced to this not only from their apprehensions that the plague may again break forth ; but from the oppressive and injurious treatment that they inform me they have met with from the Government here during the eight months in which I have been absent: money extorted from them by imprisoning their persons, and other proceedings shocking to freedom and human nature, but more particularly so at a time of such a general calamity as the late plague may be considered. Your Excellency is I hope a stranger to the proceedings in question ; indeed I am confident you could not hear of them, otherwise they woidd immediately have been put a stop to. The merchants here all look up to me as their protector, and implore my influence with Your Excellency. I have promised them the full force of it, and with that promise their fears seem somewhat to have subsided. Permit me to recommend to Your Excellency's consideration that Bussorah is a commercial town, and that no commerce can flourish, where the merchants that live in it, live under oppression. With the best of Government it will take a century for this city to recover ; how much therefore it is Your Excellency's interest to treat the merchants with humanity I entirely submit to your own determination. The five vessels that came hither from India with me, will, I hope, somewhat contribute to raise the spirits of our drooping merchants, and conduce also to Your Excellency's honor and interests. I am very happy in having brought with me the two which Your Excellency commissioned me for, they are quite new, carry 14 guns each, are called the 'Tigris and Euphrates, and well calculated for the rivers that they are named after. I wish ^ our Excellency could see them, because I am well convinced you would be pleased with the manner in which your orders have been executed. It was not in my power, before my departure from this place in April last, to obey your commands regarding a caravan's proceeding immediately across from hence to Alleppo, but I now intend doing it very shortly, as several merchants are come hither with goods for that purpose, and a direct caravan will very much assist in recovering the commerce of this country : the merchants here also are very urgent with me to get the order for a caravan renewed ; I therefore hope for Your Excellency's immediate order for that purpose. The Governor of Bombay directed me to salute Your Excellency on his part on my arrival, and to assure you he has great pleasure in sending you the two vessels alreaay mentioned with wishes, therefore, for Your Excellency's health and prosperity, I subscribe myself respectfully, &amp;c.' 134. To the above communication the Pacha returned the following reply, dated the 15th February 1774— ' I have received the letter you wrote me and am very glad to hear of your arrival at Bussorah. Your anxiety for my health is very pleasing to me. Believe me I am equally anxious for yours. On account the great hurry we are in, I cannot send you my usual mark of favour upon your arrival, but I will do it by some other opportunity. I am much obliged, and thank you much, for the two vessels that you have brought me from Bombay. For the proper management of these vessels I must depend on you and my Mussaleem and to employ them in such manner as you may think best for my interest, by which means I hope the river will be kept clear, in order that the country may benefit. The permission that I gave you in April last for the caravan to depart from Bussorah to Aleppo, was on account of the sickness that raged at that time, and because I thought it would be good for the merchants, but we are again all in good health owing to the providence of God, and many merchants are now here ready to H58 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. 1. COMPY. purchase goods. I think that, for the good of my country, the caravan must now be despatched directly to Aleppo from hence. If you have therefore prepared a caravan I beg of you to put a stop to it that the goods may go this way. ' I he'- of you to consider on some proper method of getting up to Bussorah the goods brought to Muscat by the Benishroff and Alasoor fleets, as it will conduce much to the good of trade in my country.' 135. Mr. Moore returned the following answer to the Paeha, dated the 20th February 1774:— « I have been honored with Your Excellency's letter by the return of our Mussaleem Soliman Aga's Chocadar, and am very much pleased to find that I still possess your friendship and good opinion. You may be assured I will always endeavour to cultivate these and to render myself and countrymen agreeable to you and your (government. Your Excellency will act regarding the caravan for Aleppo in such manner as seemeth best unto you. What I wrote you on the subject was what I thought lor the good oi vour country and for the commerce of this place in particular. As Your Excellency however thinks it more for your interest that the caravan should proceed from Bagdad, and not from Bussorah, I presume to urge nothing further on the subject. Kegarding the two Turkish vessels it is not in my power to man them properly at present agreeable to vour Mussaleem's request to me. When I wrote for them, they had only just stores and lascars enough in them to bring them to Bussorah. I wrote however yesterday to Bombay on the subject. When I receive the order of my superiors regarding it, i our Excellency shall be immediately acquainted therewith in a day or two. However 1 wil speak to your Mussaleem regarding this matter. I suppose your Mussaleem now writes you regarding a request made by Currim Caun, the Vakeel of 1 ersia, lor the English and Turkish ships to assist him in his war against the Muscat Arabs, a request your Excellency must suppose that is not in my power. With respect to the English ships to comply with, the Vakeel threatens in case his request is not granted to march down his force and destroy Bassorah : this intelligence is confirmed to me by a letter written thirteen days ago from Schiras by Messieurs Beaumont and Green and received by me Yesterday. In my humble opinion therefore it behoves Your Excellency to order down vour troops immediately for the defence of this place, and give orders to the difterent tribes of Arabs to march down to the banks of this river to prevent the 1 ersians from landing on this side of it. The sooner this is done the better, as Bussorah accord ing to my notions is in no state of defence whatever. W as it not for my apprehen sions of the Persians coming down, and of the plague s breaking out again in the spring, it would be very easy for me to send down a cruizer to Muscat in order to convey up the trade from that place ; but according to the present unfavor able appearance of things, the English cruizers, I am much afraid, will have other employment. As I have reason for thinking that much merchandise is passed at the Bagdad Custom House in my name, to the very great prejudice of your revenue and my honor, I hope liour Excellency will issue the propei oiders to the officers of your Customs on this subject, in order that they may permit no goods whatever to pass there as English property without a certificate from me certify ing that it is so. I beg of Your Excellency to take these matters into your serious con sideration and I pray God for your honor and prosperity.' 136. In a letter dated the 23rd April 1774, the Agent in Council at Bussorah communicated the following information to the Bombay Government:— ' The Pacha seems very sensible of your honor in Council s friendship towards him in sending him so readily the two vessels which he requested, and of the benefit and security that our factory and ships are to Bussorah. He consequently seems inclined to grant us every indulgence in his power, and we have great reason to be satisfied with his conduct towards us. As a mark of distinction he has sent a present of a horse and furniture to the Agent, and has granted permission at the Agfnt s request for a caravan's proceeding across the desert directly to Aleppo ; it will depart; in about a month another has arrived within these few days from thence; and as there is no hopes of a peace betwixt the Turks and Persians being shortly concluded from a new Sultan Huleem having lately succeeded to the Turkish throne on the death of his brother Mustapha, as there is not the least appearance of the plague either here or at Bagdad, we have a pleasing prospect of a recovering commerce. 'WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 59 137. On the 14th December 1774, the Agent at Bussorah addressed the following 1 letter to the Pacha: — ' The accounts that I have received here of the late hostilities that have taken place in Coordistan between the troops of Your Excellency and the troops of Currira Caun, the Vakeel of Persia, and the warlike preparations that I also learn Currim is making induce me to suspect the Caun may have some designs against Bus sorah. Under this suspicion I think it my duty to inform you that Bussorah is at present in a most defenceless state, as well with respect to its fortifications, as to its artillery, and what I think still more important, there appears to me to he scarcely any soldiers in the town, and I wish the few that may be in it may be depended upon. It behoves me therefore to recommend these important matters to Your Excellency's consideration, and to request you would imme diately order down a proper number of troops to secure the place should Caun carry his menaces against it into execution. My design is to embark on board the English cruizers, with all the English gentlemen that are at present at Bussorah, and continue in the river until I know the result of Currim Caun's operations. I intended also to have shipped off all the Company's property, and the property of all the English merchants, but as your Mussaleem has informed me that my doing this would be the ruin of the place, because it would occasion all the inhabitants to leave it, I have therefoie desisted, as your Mussaleem, the Dufterdar, and Sheikh Dervisehave engaged, in your and the Sultan's name, amply to indemnify the India Company and all the English merchants at Bussorah for whatever losses they may sustain by their being pre vented from shipping off such effects as they may at present have laying in their ware house at Bussorah.' 138. In a despatch dated the 1st February 1775, the Agent in Council communicated the following intelligence to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors :— ' In our last respects we informed your Honors of the defeat of the Persians by the Pacha's troops in Coordistau ; we informed you also that it was generally expected that Currim Caun would endeavour to revenge it on the Turks either by an attack on Bagdad or Bussorah, and 4 that as the latter lay more open to his attacks it was thought thjy would first be directed against it. Whilst the inhabitants of Bussorah were in this suspense, the Chaub's people (in revenge for the execution of an Arab of that tribe punished by the Mussaleem for robbery in Bussorah) for several nights together came up the river in small boats, entered the town in parties, robbed and plundered the houses, and towards the morning retired with their booty. The Mussaleem to put a stop to those disorders increased his guards by a pai*ty of Arabs from Zebier hired on purpose, and obliged the inhabitants to watch in several parts of the town; their numbers however were too small, and the town too extensive. Notwithstanding all his care the Chaub's people still committed the same disorders ; they even attempted to burn the bazar, and several times beat off the guards who were sent to oppose them. The Turks from these circumstances were convinced of their own weakness, and began seriously to consider the consequences of being attacked by the Persians and Chaub. When they were not in a capacity of securing the town from being plundered by the latter alone their apprehensions of Curim Caun consequently increased and induced the Mussaleem with Sheikh Dervise and the Dufterdar to pay a visit under the 13th ultimo to the Agent at the factory. After many professions of friendship to the Agent and English in general from the Pacha and Mussaleem, after observing as a proof there of the Pacha having directed the Mussaleem to consult the Agent on all material points in which the Pacha's interests and the prosperity of Bussorah were concerned, the Mussaleem requested his advice on the then uncertain posture of affairs between the Turks and Persians, and the proba bility of Curim Caun's attacking this place. He requested to know also what were the Agent's intentions, and how the English would act in such a case; the Agent ac- knowleged himself much obliged for the good opinion that the Pacha and Mussaleem entertained of him, and as a proof of it said he would give the best advice that was in his power. He observed to the Mussaleem the weak state of the town as well as with respect to fortifications, artillery, or soldiers of which in his opinion the Pacha ought immediately to be informed, and to be requested to send down as soon as possible from 3,000 to 4,000 men from Bagdad for the defence of it. In the meantime he recommended to the Mussaleem to write to the Montifick Sheikh to hold his Arabs in readiness for defending the banks of the river, and to employ people in Persia on whom he could4 60 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. depend to give him the earliest intelligence of Curim Caun's designs. With respect to the part that the English intended pursuing, the Agent informed the Mussaleem it was that of the strictest neutrality, that as soon as the Agent thought it prudent, he should embark with the rest of the English on hoard the two cruizers now here, first shipping otf the Hon'hle Company's and other English effects, for which purpose solely the cruizers were kept here.' 139. Before daylight on the morning of the 9th April 1775, a portion of the Persian army which for several days had been in the vicinity of Bussorah made an attack on that place, but was repulsed with loss. Considering it however probable that reinforcements from the Persian Camp would be sent for the purpose of capturing Bussorah the Agent in Council retired on board the Eagle, one of the Company's vessels then in the river, and subsequently, under the circumstances stated in the following extract from a letter which they addressed to the Bombay Government on the 22nd of the same month (April 1775), they proceeded to the Bushire roads where they anchored,— ' The sudden departure of this boat for Muscat affords us only time to inform you that Bussorah was invested by the Persian Army under the 7th instant, and that under the 11th the Persian fleet consisting of near sixty sail, among which were twenty-two large galivats and dows, having approached Bussorah with intent as it evidently appeared to join the Chaub's which was above us. We judged it the most ad visable measure to endeavour at a junction with the expected vessels from Bombay. Letters from Mr. Beaumont, received under the above date, advised us of four being hourly expected at Bushire, and we thought that their being able to make their way good to us through such a fleet as was between us and the bar was impracticable. We therefore under the 11th left Bussorah, and in our passage down the river were attacked by the greatest part of the Persian fleet under the command of Shaik Nassir, who at first made an appearance of waiting for us, but finding us continue to stand on, he made the best of his way to the Hulfar, into which he retreated, and the depth of water would not permit us to pursue him as the galivats had the advantage of our s and would not permit us to approach them nearer than random shot. We suffered no damage in the action, and we believe their loss, if any, must have been very inconsiderable. The Persian fleet began their attack upon us at half-past two in the afternoon, and did not leave ()1 firing until seven; their scheme appears to us to have been to have got our ships between them and the Chaub's fleet, and then by every means in their power have prevented our proceeding down the river. Shaik Nassir, however, writes to Bushire that our vessels attacked him first, and that three of our shot went through his galivat that he notwithstanding will continue a friend to the English and do them every service in their power.' 140. In a further despatch to the Hon'ble Court, dated the 30th April 1775, the Agent in Council communicated the following addi- tional particulars in regard to the attack on Bussorah :— *' In our last we omitted to inform you of some occurrences which took place at Bussorah before we left it. Under the 8th instant, sixteen galivats and boats appearing off the north end of Chellaby's island, Lieutenants Robinson and Thistleson wrote us requesting to know whether they should not weigh and stand down to attack them whilst it was daylight, and before they could be joined by the Chaub's fleet,^ and as we left it to them either to do so, or to wait for them at anchor, as they might judge proper, they weighed and stood down, but the galivats on their approach retired, and the ships returned to their station off the town. At about 2 o'clock the next morning the Persians made a desperate attack to scale the walls between the Zebene and Bagdad gates ; some of them had even got on the wall, but through the bravery of the Arabs under the command of Shaik Tamar of the Montiflcks were repulsed with great loss. On this attack we went on board the Eagle, the Persian army then advanced very near the town, and several skirmishes took peace but entirely to the disadvantage of tha Persians. Under the 10th at night the bridge cf boats which we had thrown across the river was attacked, and one of the boats burnt, and under the 11th we quitted the place as advised you in our last respects just after we left it; we saw another boat of the bridge on fire. Since writing the foregoing the Agent has received a letter from Bussorah •rWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1046 TO 1846. 61 by the w:iy of Grain dated the20tli instant (April 1775). Bussorah then held out, and the Nakodah of the boat which brought the letter informs us that the Montifick and Benechalid Arabs had assembled for its protection, that the desert was overflowed, and that the town was in very little danger from the Persian army. 141. On the 17th February 1775, Mr. Robert Garden, then a Member of this Government, left Bombay for Bussorah, for the purpose of attending to some private affairs, and with the intention of proceed ing afterwards to England overland. On arriving at Bush ire, on the 7th April following, Mr. Garden, in conformity with instructions he had received from Government previous to his departure from Bombay, endeavoured to effect the release* of Mr. Beaumont, in which object he succeeded. Mr. Garden at the same time amicably adjusted all differ ences between the East India Company and the Persians, and re-esta blished a factory at Bushire. Mr. Beaumont was on this occasion appointed by Government Resident at Bushire, and Mr. Green, Joint- Factor, at that place. 142. In consequence of ill health Mr. Moore (Agent for the Ilon'ble Company's affairs at Bussorah) proceeded on the 15th July 1775 from Bushire to Bombay, and, on his departure, addressed the following letter to the Mussaleem at Bussorah :— ' As a long confinement on ship board has much impaired my health, and I at present see not the least probability of returning to Bussorah, I find myself under the necessity for these and many other weighty considerations to proceed to Bombay on the ships now proceeding to that place. Messieurs LaTouche and Abraham remain at Bushire, with the intention of returning to Bussorah as soon as ever the war between the Turks and Persians is terminated, in order to take charge of the Hon'ble Company's factory and effects, and I trust Your Excellency will not permit any person whatever except Mr. LaTouche and Abraham to take charge of them until my return, unless such person produces to Your Excellency a Commission from the Governor of Bombay for that purpose. The honor that Your Excellency has acquired in the gallant defence of Bussorah will be remembered to the latest times. I would it had been in our power to have assisted you more than we did, but it was not of which I doubt not but you will be perfectly convinced on maturely weighing the several circumstances before and since our departure from Bussorah. Your two ketches I intend taking with me to Bombay for the same reasons that I brought them with me from Bussorah; if I leave them here they will certainly be taken by the Persian galivats. My advice however to you is to send me an order to sell them at Bombay as they will cost you much money to repair them, and the Governor and Council are so much in want of their fleet in India, that they cannot spare a cruizer to protect your ketches nor men to man them. I once more beg leave to recommend Mr LaTouche and Mr. Abraham to your favor and protection and hope for the continuation of your friendship and good opinion.' 143. On the 16th April 1776, Bussorah was surrendered by the Turkish authorities to the Persians, and on the 21st of the same month, Sadoo Caun, the Persian General, made a public entry into that town. At the invitation of Sadoo Caun, the Agent in Council f of Bussorah returned to that place from Bushire on the 11th of the fol lowing month, and re-opened the Hon'ble Company's factory. In a letter to the Bombay Government, dated the 4th June 1776, the Agent in Council at Bussorah stated that on their return they found the Hon'ble Company's factory in excellent order, that Sadoo Caun expressed himself willing to show the English every indulgence, that his people * Vide paragraph 131, page 56. f Consisting of Mr. LaTouchc (Agent), Mr. Galley, and Mr. Abraham.62 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OP E. I. COMPY. had shown particular respect to the Agent in Council, and that the first appearance of things was so flattering that if they had not been acquainted with the Persian character they would have formed a most pleasing opinion of their future prospects ' under the Persian rule at Bussorah/' The following extract from the above letter contains infor mation in regard to the cause of the Turks having surrendered Bussorah to the Persians and the terms on which the surrender was made:— ' Sadoo Caun keeps his men in much better order than could have been expected from the rabble of which his army is mostly composed. The terms of the capitulation (which the great distresses of the Turks and the little prospect of assistance from Bagdad obliged him to sue for, and which Sadoo Caun granted) were that the inhabitants of Bussorah should not be molested with respect to their persons and families, and Sadoo Caun seems hitherto to have kept his word in this respect. No great severities have as yet been used towards them, as the Persian soldiers however have taken the advantage of supplying the town with provisions, and there is no trade going on, the former poor inhabitants have no way of providing for the daily subsistence of themselves and families, and feel almost as great distresses in this respect as during the siege; they were obliged in that calamitous period to sell the few necessaries that belonged to their houses or persons, and we fear that Sadoo Caun will not preserve his present moderation when he finds the difficulty attending the collection of the large sums ordered to be levied on the town; he has left this business to the principal men of the Bussorah inhabitants, and they to ease themselves have put a greater proportion of the amount on the poor than their circumstances are able to afford.' 144. In a further letter dated the 26th September 1776, the Agent in Council at Bussorah reported that Sadoo Caun (the Persian General) had recently violated the privileges of the Hon'ble Company's factory by forcibly seizing some native merchants that had retired there for protection. In consequence of this indignity, the Agent in Council come to a Resolution again to withdraw the Hon'ble Company's factory from Bussorah to Bushire. This Resolution however was not carried into effect in consequence of the Persian General having subsequently assured the Agent in Council— ' that no further infringement should be made on their privileges. In the same letter the Agent in Council observed as follows :—Situated as we are at present, we consider ourselves as little better than prisoners, the Bussorah inhabitants regard our factory as some security to them, or at least as some check on the rapacity of the Persians. The Persians on their side are sensible that it gives consequence to their Government, that it encourages the inhabitants to stay here, and that if they keep the town they may reap great advantages from our trade; it is not to be supposed therefore that they will consent to our departure when we want to leave the place, and the policy of the present Government leads them to use compulsion when they think it necessary towards carrying the point they have in view. To endeavour to convince them that force is incompatible with commerce, especially in regard to us, might have succeeded formerly, but now would be as difficult as to endeavour to convince them of the absurdity of their religion. We are still in the greatest uncertainty as to the intentions of both Turks and Persians regarding this place. Advices from Bagdad dated about thirty days ago mention that Abdoolla (the present Pacha) had received a large supply of money from Constantinople and was making preparations for war, at the same time it is said that caravans pass as usual between Schyras and Bagdad; and the Persians here reported that a peace has been nearly concluded.' 145. The following extract from a despatch addressed by the Agent in Council at Bussorah to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors on the 23rd February 1777 contains an account of further encroachments having been made by the Persian authorities on the privileges of the Hon'ble Company's factory :— ' In our last respects of the 24th ultimo we informed you of some encroachments made on our privileges here by the Persian Government, of our intentions of addressing theWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 63 Vakeel on the subject, and of our apprehensions that if the Government's people were not more speedily checked, they would proceed to such lengths as to render our departure from hence more eligible than our stay here. We are sorry now to inform Your Honor that these apprehensions were but too well founded: the 31st ultimo your broker, Coja Yacoob, with the women and others of his family were seized in their own house and obliged by repeated beatings, at some of which Ally Mahomed Caun, the Governor himself, was present, to sign a bond for 6,000 tomans. Our Linguists sent to ask the reason of this treatment was again denied admittance, and as all remonstrance we found would be ineffectual, we shut up our factory and determined on having as little communication with Ally Mahomed Caun's people as possible, until we should receive an answer to a letter which we then prepared for Curim Caun, and which was despatched to Shyras by the way of Bushire, as soon as the wind would admit, on the 6th instant. In the meantime Ally Mahomed Caun's people finding that the shutting up the factory had alarmed the town in such a manner that they were obliged to double the guards on the gates to prevent the escape of the inhabitants. Being disappointed also in the amount which they expected from Coja Yacoob, notwith standing all their severity, and beginning, we believe, to be apprehensive of the conse quences of our complaining to the Vakeel, they gave us many hints that if we went to see the Caun, everything might be amicably adjusted; but finding these had no effect, two of his principal people at length desired to see us. Being admitted after some hesita tion into the factory, they made many professions of the Caun's friendship towards us and endeavoured to persuade us to overlook what was past, and to visit the Caun, in which case everything might be settled and Coja \ acoob released from the trouble in which he was. 8uch, hon'ble gentlemen, is our present disagreeable and uncertain situa tion, and we have no prospect of any change in it for the better before the arrival of a cruizer from Bombay, or of answers to the letters of the Vakeel. If the latter are as favorable as we flatter ourselves they will be, we may yet do something in the way of trade at this place; but should they not be so, and there should be as little prospect as there is at present of the towns again falling under a Turkish or Arab Government, in duty to Your Honors we cannot avoid confessing that we much fear the advantages which may be expected in the way ol trade will be far from an equivalent for the expense and risk under such unsettled and rapacious Government as is the present, and that the sooner we can withdraw the settlement from hence the better it will be for Your Honor as well as your interest.' 146. On the representations of the Agent in Council at Bussorah reaching Curim Caun* in regard to the encroachments made by the Persian authorities upon the Hon'ble Company's factory, he issued the following phirman to the Persian Governor of Bussorah:— ' Youlmust know that I have a very great regard for the English nation; they were always^ friends to this kingdom and now are so, on this account my friendship towards them is very great, and I must always take notice of their situation. You are there fore to take particular care that you behave in a proper manner to Mr. LaTouche, the linglish Chief, and to his people. You are to do them all the good you can. You are not to suffer any one whatever to use force towards him, or the people that are in his service, or to ask anything from them. In short, you are to behave to them in such a manner that he may be contented and carry on his business with credit. These orders must be strictly obeyed, whether he is contented or whether he is displeased must not pass unnoticed by us; we must pay regard to his representations. I repeat that what I now write must not be neglected or disobeyed by you on any account. \ on know that the revenues of Bussorah depend on its customs, and you are therefore to behave in such a manner as trade may go on and the revenues receive no detriment.' 147. This phirman, which reached Bussorah on the 17th March 1777, was accompanied by the following letter from Curim Caun to Mr. LaTouche, the Agent at Bussorah :— ' 1 have received your petition and everything that you wrote concerning the situation oi Bussorah 1 have understood. I have always had, and still have, the greatest regard for the Lnglish Nation, and 1 know they have the same regard towards me. I have * The Vakeel of Persia.G4 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGAKDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. always experienced their friendship towards me. I have now wrote a phirraan to Ally Mahomed Caun, Governor of Bussorah, and have ordered him to behave in such a manner towards you and your people that you may be entirely contented and carry on your business to your satisfaction, both you and the people that are under you. 1 have ordered that no person whatever shall molest them in any shape, that every one shall behave towards them so that they may be free to carry on their business to their satis faction. I have also wrote a phirman regarding the Jews and Armenians at Bussorah, ordering that they shall be well treated; that except the head-money not a pence shall be taken from them; and that if any of the Jews or Armenians want to go to any part of the Gulf for the sake of trade, they shall have liberty to do so with the knowledge of Coja Yacoob or Coja Aratoon. These orders, which I have given Ally Mahomed Caun, must be obeyed by him, and I desire that you will always depend that my friendship towards you is very great.' 148. On the 6th May 1777 the Agent in Council at Bussorah informed the Hon'ble the Court of Directors that they had received information from Bagdad to the effect, that the Turks were making great preparations for penetrating into Persia by five different ways as soon as the season would admit; that the Pacha of Bagdad had received large supplies of men and money from Constantinople, and intended shortly marching against Bussorah. The inhabitants of Bussorah, it was stated in the same letter, were looking forward with delight to the expected approach of the Pacha's army in the hope of being restored to a milder and more secure Government than the Persian rule. 149. On the 16th June 1777 the Agent in Council at Bussorah received the following additional phirman from Curim Caun, Vakeel of Persia;— ' You have desired some settled rule by which your nation may come and go and trade to Bussorah. On account of the friendship which subsists between the English nation and me, agreeable to your desire 1 have wrote a phirman to Ally Mahomed Caun, Governor of Bussorah, and have ordered that the customs on the English goods, imported and exported, shall be the same as in the time of the Mussaleemship of Soliman Aga, not more and not less, and in every respect that your people shall be treated in the same manner as they were at that time. With respect to the Jewish and Armenian merchants residing at Bussorah, I have given orders to Ally Mahomed Caun that if they want to go for trade near Bussorah, or far from Bussorah, if you desire that they shall go, they must go, and that these orders must be obeyed. You must rest assured that my friendship and favor towards you are very great. You must go according to what I now write you, and give courage to your people; and if you desire any of the merchants as above to go from Bussorah, you will inform Ally Mahomed Caun, that he may not prevent them ; if you have any other business, write to me.' 150. On the 2nd August 1778 this Government, under the au thority contained in the following extract from a despatch from the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, dated the 4th July of the preceding year, directed the withdrawal of all the Company's servants from Bussorah, with the exception of one, on whom it was resolved to bestow the appel lation of Resident:— 'We have lately received such advices from Bussorah, dated the 24th January and 23rd February 1777, complaining much of the oppressions from the Persians on the merchants and subjects, as give us very little prospect of the revival of trade there, consequently an addition of servants and expenses would be only increasing the pre sent burthen of that settlement, for which reason we now order that Mr. Moore be admitted to a seat at the Board agreeable to his standing. We are very apprehensive when the Persians find that the merchants and inhabitants have no more money they will begin with our servants, which happened some years past in Persia, by which the Company were very considerable sufferers. As the Agent and Council seemed to think that the Persians would not permit them to leave the place, they applied toWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 65 Curlm Caun* to withdraw to Bushire, hoping by that means to obtain orders from him for better treatment, which was very proper ; but from what has past, and having been so often deceived by the phirmans, we have no expectation of redress, and have come to a resolution to withdraw our servants from thence as soon as can be done, in such a manner as not to endanger their persons or the effects of the Company. The best method that occurs to us is to obtain leave from the Cawn to come to Bushire which probably he may not refuse, being under his Government. When this is effected, and after staying a short time there, all the servants but one, must return to Bombay. We now repeat our former orders never to risk more of the Company's property at Bushire than Rupees 10,000 at any one time. If Bussorah should be given up to the Turkish Government as before, we permit in such case that a Resident be sent there ; but you must give us previous intelligence of such measure that we may give orders in what manner the settlement is to be ultimately established.'' 151. The above extract was forwarded by this Government to the Agent in Council at Bussorah on the 2nd August 1778, accompanied by the following instructions :— ' We now transmit an extract from the Commands of the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, dated the 4th July 1777, and received the 30th April last, b}' the Besborough. We should have fully complied therewith by ordering an entire removal of their servants and effects from Bussorah did not the circumstance of an approaching war with France render it highly necessary that one servant should be kept there for the purpose of for warding packets. Added to this, so long as we have a settlement at Bushire, it will be proper for the security of the Hon'ble Company's property, in case of accident to the single servant that will now be left there, that there should be another in the gulf ready to take charge of it: we have therefore resolved to continue one of the factors there in quality of Resident, and we hereby appoint Mr. William Digges Latouche to that station, if his health will permit him to accept of it. We are glad of the oppor tunity of giving Mr. Latouche this testimony of our good opinion, but if his health will not permit him to remain in the gulf, we have thought proper to appoint Mr. George Green to the Residency of Bussorah, unless Mr. Beaumont should prefer it to Bushire, in which case we have given him the option, and in either case we have appointed Mr. Green to the vacant Residency. Mr. Latouche must accordingly, on receipt hereof, take charge of the Hon'ble Company's effects and property at Bussorah as Resi dent, and Messrs. Abraham and Gaily and Mr. Robinson, the Surgeon, must return to India on the Eagle. Such part of the woollens as are not contracted for, and such of the other effects as may not be absolutely necessary for the factory, must be withdrawn to Bushire in the manner directed by the Hon'ble Company, and from thence sent to India. ' The Residencies of Bussorah and Bushire must now be totally independent of each other, and we have thought proper to fix the expences of the former (Bussorah) agreeable to the following establishment, which must not on any account be exceeded:— Rupee. s. Diet money to the Resident... 4 J anisary Chouses ... per mensem 150 0 0 ... 99 60 0 0 : 4 Factory servants • • • 30 0 0 2 Coolies ... 99 12 0 0 1 Porter ... 99 10 0 0 1 Waterman ... 99 7 0 0 : Coffee-room expences . • • 99 30 0 0 1 Stable charges • •• 99 30 0 0 A Linguist • • . 99 20 0 0 A Persian writer 99 15 0 0 An Assistant in the Warehouse • • . 99 10 0 0 2 Gardeners ... 99 15 0 0 ' Total ... 99 389 0 0 * The Persian Vakeel.66 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 'We will admit of no larger sum than Rupees 300 being expended in one year in repairs to the factory. ' We allow the Resident to purchase three horses on the Hou'ble Company's account, the cost of which must not exceed Rupees 200 each. ' No presents are to be given to any one, but in cases of the most absolute neces sity. ' The factory guard of sepoys now at Bussorah are to be returned to India by the Eagle, on which account we have in the above Statement added two J anisaries to the number before allowed.' 152. Mr. Latouche replied to the above letter on the 14th Decem ber 1778, and expressed his acknowledgment for the confidence reposed on him by Government in appointing him Kesident at Bussorah. 153. In the same letter* Mr. Latouche made the following represen tation to Government:— ' The private trade of this place, since the capture of it by the Persians, has been at such a low ebb that the 1 per cent. Consulage which is allowed to the Agent, or Resi dent, on the European imports, and which used in some measure to compensate for the deficiency in their appointments from the Hon'ble Company, is now a mere trifle. Last year it amounted to little more than Rupees 200; in this it will hardly be as much. What little trade is stirring consists in cofi'ee and other 4 gruff' from Bushire and Muscat, and in a few piece-goods from Surat. The country merchants find a method of import ing these goods at a very moderate duty, whilst the Resident is liable to the payment of 8 per cent, here, besides the 6 per cent, paid to the Hon'ble Company at iSurat, on such goods as he may bring from thence; the country merchants therefore can afford greatly to undersell him, and he has little prospect, whilst the present Government continues, of obtaining a profit on such trade in any shape adequate to the risk and great uncertainty of the markets. Would Your Honor, &amp;c., however, extend your indulgence still further to him by exempting his own trade from the payment of the Company's 3 per cent, customs here, which it is at present liable to, it would be no real loss to them, whilst it would in some measure remove the disadvantage that he at present labours under. ' The Resident most humbly hopes that this representation of his situation may not be considered by you as proceeding either from discontent or ingratitude. He is highly sensible of the honor you have done him by your late appointment. He is convinced that at the same time you intended him advantage by it, and he would rather trust to his fortune for the one than be deterred by still greater difficulties from accepting the other.' 154. In the diary of this Government for the 25th May 1779 allusion is made to a letter having been received from the Residentf at Bussorah, dated the 25th of the preceding month, ' reporting the circumstances of the late revolution in that city, by which it has again reverted to the hands of the Turks ' and that the Resident entertained the pleasing hope that by this change ' the Hon'ble Company would again possess every advantage which they formerly had in the gulf.' The following is an extract from this letter :— 'Our last respects were dated the 29th December (1778). We are sorry to inform Your Honor in Council that your original packet per Eagle, despatched the 31st October, was not received at Aleppo the 19th January, though the duplicate which followed it 19 days after was received at, and forwarded from, Aleppo the 8th and 9th January. We are advised from Bagdad that the messengers who carried it had been obliged to * No reply or Resolution of Government on this letter can be traced, f The letter was signed by the Kesident and by Mr. Abraham, his co-adjutor.M- WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 67 proceed to that place after having been robbed and stript of their cloathes, camels, and packet by the Arabs; but as we are also informed that the latter was found and carried to Aleppo by some other Arabs, we do not yet despair of hearing of its safe arrival there. These unusual accidents have been partly owing to the unsettled state of the desert for some time past, to the packets being des patched from ' Grain,' and to our not having by that means the power of bringing the messengers to so strict an account as when they were immediately under the Government of Bussorah, and were despatched directly from Zebere. The late Ee volution here, however, having occasioned the return of those of the Zebere Arabs who did not choose to trust to Sadoo Caun's promises of protection and encour agement, we hope that these disagreeable interruptions to our despatches to Aleppo will be removed, and that they will in future be made with greater certainty, more expedition, and less expense. To the enclosed copies of our letters to our honorable masters* of the 22nd February, 6th March, and 2nd April, we beg leave to refer your Honor, &amp;c., for the particulars of the late most favourable revolution and of the other transactions here to the latter date.' U nfortunately no copy o£ either of the three despatches addressed by the Resident and Mr. Abraham to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, alluded to in the above extract, is in the possession of this Government. The date and circumstances therefore under which Bussorah was regained by the Turks from the Persians cannot be ascertained further than that it was accomplished by means of a revolution, and that it took place between the 29th December 1778 and the 2nd April 1779. 155. In the same letter the Resident stated that it appeared to him probable that the Hon^ble the Court of Directors on hearing that this change had taken place in the Government of Bussorah, and that there was every expectation that the Hon'ble Company would meet with the same countenance as formerly from the Pacha 'of Bagdad, would resolve on continuing the factory at Bussorah; the Resident therefore resolved, pending further orders, to retain Mr. Abraham at Bussorah for the purpose of assisting him in the management of the Company^ affairs. The Resident also solicit that the Surgeon who had hitherto been attached to the factory might be permitted to remain. Both of these applications were complied with by Government in a letter dated the 31st December 1779. 156. In a letter dated the 30th October 1779 the Resident at Bus sorah reported that he had on the same day received information from Bagdad to the effect that Hossein, the Pacha, had been deposed three days before by the Janisaries, and had been compelled to quit Bagdad. On this intelligence reaching Constantinople, the Sultan appointed Isoli- man Aga Pacha of Bagdad and Bussorah, with permission to reside at either place as he might see fit. With reference to this arrangement, the following remarks were made in a joint letter addressed to Govern ment by the Resident and Mr. Abraham on the 15th January 1780 : ' Bagdad having been a long time in an unsettled state, the presence of the Pacha will possibly be necessary for putting affairs therein a proper train, and as it is the most central place of the provinces that are now annexed to his Government, it is probable that he will fix his residence at Bagdad in preference to Bussorah ; but should such be his resolutions, he cannot, for want of money and men, put it into execution for some time at least, until the Porte should assist him in these respects, which they do not at present seem in a capacity ot doing. At any rate, the Pachaw is so very sensible of the assistance allorded him by us, not only during his captivity at Shyras, but in procurring his late preferment, that whether he continues here, or goes to Bagdad, we doubt not * The Hou'ble the Court of Directors.68 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. but the English in particular will receive every reasonable indulgence that it is in his power to grant them. The late troubles too having clearly shown the consequence of Bussorah, and that Bagdad cannot well be supported without it, we think that the Pacha will show greater attention to Bussorah than has been given to it by the former Pachas for many years past. On the whole, from the known prudence and spirit of Soliman Pacha, as well as from the great opinion which is entertained of him by the people in general, not only of Bagdad and Bussorah, but of the several adjacent pro vinces, we flatter ourselves with seeing these countries in a very few years in a more flourishing condition than before the late troubles. The communication with Bagdad, which has for a long time past been stopt by the Ghesaal Arabs already begins to open, and not only they, but the rest of the Arabs, profess the greatest respect for, and obedi ence to, Soliman Pacha.' 157. In a letter dated the 15th August 1780 the Resident at Bussorah communicated the following intelligence— ' I have the pleasure to inform Your Honor in Council that the Pacha has lately gained a complete victory over the rebels who have so long been troublesome to the Bagdad Government; that Mahomet Katteel's son, who commanded them, was killed in the engagement which lasted several hours ; and that Mahomet Beg, whom he endea voured to support as Pacha of Bagdad, has either met with the same fate or been obliged to fly. ' This event, it is hoped, will firmly establish the Pacha in the Government of Bagdad, and induce the Ghesaal Arabs, who have so long interrupted the communica tion with that place, to make his submission without obliging the Pacha to undertake an expedition against him as he proposes doing, as soon as the water falls sufficiently to permit him to follow the Sheikh into the marsh in which he has taken refuge.' 158. In consequence of the death, on the 17th June 1780, of Mr. Abraham, Government appointed Mr. Samuel Manesty (then in Bombay) Assistant to the Resident at Bussorah. Mr. Manesty arrived at Bussorah in the month of March following, but the precise date is not stated. 159. During the years 1782 and 1783 Government complied with requests preferred by the Pacha of sending him from Bombay 1,300 stand of arms, and a supply of gunpowder and cannon shot, for which on their arrival he paid the cost price, and the expense of their convey ance to Bussorah. Government also, at the request, in the first instance, of the Pacha, and subsequently of the Ottoman Porte, caused about this time six armed gallivats to be built in Bombay, and forwarded to Bussorah. Government was reimbursed for all expenses incurred on this account. 160. In a letter dated the 10th July 1783 the Resident at Bussorah solicited permission permanently to locate a Native Agent at Bagdad on a salary of Rupees 1,100 per annum for the purpose of transacting business with the Pacha on account of the Hon'ble Com pany, whose duty it would also be to forward intelligence and packets to Bussorah. This arrangement was sanctioned by Government on the 30th November 1783, with authority, as Coja Marcar, whom the Resident proposed to nominate to this appointmSfrtT^aiT' performed the duties of an Agent for the Company at Bagdad from July 1781, without remu neration, to pay him arrears of salary at the above rate (Rupees 1,100 per annum) for that period. 161. In a letter dated the 10th October 1784 Mr. LaTouche stated that he had received a communication from the Hon'ble the Court of Directors giving him permission, in reply to an application he had madeWITH TURKISH ARABIA 164-6 TO 1846. 69 to that authority, to proceed for the recovery of his health, either to Bagdad, Aleppo, or England. Under this permission Mr. LaTouche left Bussorah for England, via Bagdad and Aleppo, on the 6th November 1784, and made over charge of the Residency to his Assistant, Mr. Manesty. Mr. Manesty remained in charge of the Bussorah Residency from the 6th November 1784 to the 7th March 1786, when he was relieved by Mr. John Griffith, who had been appointed Resident in succession to Mr. LaTouche. Mr. Manesty was at the same time re-appointed Assistant to the Resident, with the privilege, as he had attained the rank of factor, of signing conjointly with the Resident all letters addressed from the Bussorah factory to Government. Mr. Griffith arrived at Bussorah on the 7th March 1786, and on the 10th of the same month assumed charge of his appointment as Resident at Bussorah. On the 5th December of the same year, however, Mr. Griffith was com pelled from ill health to return to Bombay, again leaving Mr. Manesty in charge of the Residency. 162. In a letter dated the 20th February 1787 Mr. Manesty communicated the following intelligence to Government:— ' Some months ago Hadjee Soliman Beg, who is the Shaik of the Tye Arabs, a very powerful tribe in the vicinity of Bagdad, and who with his family have resided many years at the Pacha's Court, was discovered by the Pacha to be engaged in a dangerous correspondence with a person who, for reasons unknown to me, had incurred the Pacha's displeasure. On this discovery, the Pacha immediately ordered Hadjee Soliman Beg with his family to quit Bagdad, and he seized his property there to a very considerable amount. Hadjee Soliman Beg instantly obeyed the order, retired from Bagdad with his family to the Arabs of which he is the Shaik, and has since openly taken up arms against the Pacha and his Government. Hadjee Soliman Beg's party is a powerful one, and the Pacha has some time ago sent a con siderable army under the command of the Kia to punish the rebel. Various engage ments have happened between the two armies, and various have been the accounts which have been received of them here. About twenty days ago the Mussaleem sent to me to inform me that the Pacha's army had gained a complete victory over that of Hadjee Soliman Beg, and that Hadjee Soliman Beg was reduced to extremities. A few days past, however, letters were received from Bagdad containing the disagreeable intelligence that Hadjee Soliman Beg had routed the Pacha's army and taken prisoner the Pacha of Coordistan, who had joined the army by order of the Pacha. The above is the present state of affairs in the vicinity of Bagdad, which does not fail to give great concern to the Pacha, and injuriously to affect the general trade of this country. Some time ago, whilst the Mussaleem and the inhabitants of Bussorah were anxiously expecting to receive advice of the issue of Hadjee Soliman Beg's rebellion, a report was spread here, and which was supported by letters from many persons of consequence, both at Bagdad and Aleppo, that Hadjee Soliman Beg had been appointed by the Ottoman Emperor a Pacha of three tails and Pacha of Bagdad. The Pacha himself believed that the appointment had actually taken place ; he sent for Coja Marcar, the Hon'ble Company's Agent at Bagdad, and in his presence ordered a letter to be written to His Majesty's Ambassador at the Porte, in which he in the warmest terms entreated his friendly support and good offices at the Porte to set aside the appointment which he supposed had been given to Hadjee Soliman Beg, and acknowledged his many serious obligations to the English. I am now happy to inform you that I have every reason to suppose that the report of Hadjee Soliman Beg having been appointed Pacha of Bagdad is totally without foundation. I have not, however, received any intelligence from the Ambassador on the subject. Revolutions in the Government of these coun tries are generally attended with so much confusion, and have generally such evil consequences, that the report of Hadjee Soliman Beg's appointment as Pacha of Bag dad gave me considerable concern. I however indulged the hope, that the very extensive influence which the English now fortunately enjoy, and the very strict friend ship which without an exception they now are in with every person of consequence in the country, might, in the event of a revolution, give security to the Hon'ble Company's factory servants and dependents here, and I also indulged the hope that Hadjee70 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. Soliraan Beg, in the event of his having obtained an appointment as Pacha of Bagdad, and of his establishing himself in the office, would preserve in • his former attachment to the English, and still acknowledge the obligations which he has frequently confessed to be under to me for my kind attention to his brother, Mahomed Beg. in the year 1785. I most anxiously hope that Soliman, the present Pacha, may long hold the reins of the Government of this country. Although his conduct has not been such as his obliga tions to the English ought to have dictated to him, he still feels, and sometimes acknowledges, those obligations. He is really partial to the English, and by an undul- gent conduct towards the merchants gives more encouragement to them than other Pachas have done. I beg leave to assure you that to increase the credit and influence of the Hon'ble Company's factory here is, and shall be, my constant study. The Ghessal Arabs continue to obstruct the communication between Bussorah and Bagdad by the River Euphrates, the merchants are therefore under the necessity of sending their goods by the River Tigris at great expense, and with much loss of time. In consequence of the wars and troubles now existing in this country, and of the waters of the River Tigris and Euphrates not having risen to their usual height during the last year, a general scarcity of all kinds of provisions now unfortunately prevails, and the prices thereof have risen in an enormous degree.' 163. On the 6th May 1787 Shaik Swiney, one of the Montifick Arab Chiefs, entered Bussorah with a larg-e force, took possession of the town and Turkish fleet, and imprisoned the Mussaleetn (or Governor). Shaik Swiney retained possession of Bussorah until the early part of October 1787, when the Pacha, who had moved up with an army from Bagdad, attacked Shaik Swiney's forces and put them to flight. The Pacha's troops then took possession of the town, and on the November, Mustapha Aga, who had been appointed by the Pacha, Mus- saleem, made a public entry into Bussorah. Mustapha Aga was, however, removed by the Pacha in the Government of Bussorah in the early part of 1789, and was succeeded by Esau Beg, who assumed charge of the Government by order of the Pacha on the 15th March 1789. Esau Beg was, however, removed by the Pacha on the 22nd October of the same year, and was succeeded by Mahomed Aga. In a further letter, dated the 10th March 1791, the Resident stated that the most perfect tranquillity had for a long time past existed at Bussorah, and that Shaik Swiney had a short time before thrown himself on the mercy of the Pacha, and with his followers had repaired to Bagdad, where on his arrival he had been received by the Pacha in a very honorable manner. 164. In a statement framed under orders from Government by the Civil Auditor in December 1844, which was forwarded to the Gov ernment of India on the 24th January 1845, the whole of the changes which occurred in the constitution of the Bussorah Residency from 1788 to 184? are exibited in detail, together with the names of the various officers who during that period held the appointment of Resident, Assis tant Resident, Political Agent, &amp;c., and the salary and allowances drawn by each officer; it will therefore, I conclude, be unnecessary in the remaining part of this summary to notice these appointments. 165. In a letter dated the 1st January 1792 the Resident and Mr. Harford f Jones communicated the following intelligence to Gov ernment :— ' In our address of the 16th October we had the honor to communicate information that a rupture would probably take place between this Government and the Chaub * The precise date cannot be ascertained from the records. f Who was associated with the Resident under the denomination of ' Joint Factor.'WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 71 Shaik, in consequence of the destruction of the principal part of the fleet belonging to the latter. Such a rupture took place on the Chaub Shaik giving his directions for the construction, on the banks of the Bussorah River, of strong batteries with a view of intercepting the vessels which had, after destroying his gallivats, imported at Bussorah on their return from thence to sea. On the departure of the vessels in question from Bussorah, they were accompanied by the Turkish fleet commanded by the Captain Bash a, and on their arrival off the beforementioned batteries an engage ment took place between them and the people belonging to the Chaub Shaik stationed therein, which terminated without any serious advantage on either side, the people belonging to the Chaub Shaik retiring from the batteries to Dorah by the vessels belonging to the coffee fleet proceeding to sea, and by the Turkish fleet returning to Bussorah. The conduct of the Chaub Shaik in erecting batteries on the Bussorah side of the River, and in demanding from the Pacha restitution, either in money, or vessels, for the loss which he has lately sustained, has extremely irritated the latter, and may possibly induce him to act offensively against the former. We have much satisfaction in informing you that during the late dispute between this Government and the Chaub Shaik, the Chaub Shaik gave very acceptable proofs of his friendship towards the English nation in permitting the gallivat hired by the Resident for the conveyance of Major MacDonald from Bussorah to Muscat to pass his batteries in the most honorable manner as on other occasions.' 166. In March and April 1791 some of the Jews residing- at Bussorah behaved towards the Resident (Mr. Manesty) in an insulting manner, in consequence of his having interfered in behalf of a Christian inhabitant of Bussorah, named llisha, to the extent of endeavourino- to obtain for him a fair and impartial trial on a charge advanced ao-amst him of having murdered a Jew, instead of his being condemned on'some ex parte evidence which had been adduced by the Jews before the Mussaleem. Threats of personal violence were made to Mr. Manesty by the Jews, with an intimation that if he further interfered in behalf of the accused, they would cut down the Hon'ble Company's flag-staff. These threats, however, were not put into execution. The accused was sum marily convicted before the Mussaleem of the crime imputed to him and was sentenced to suffer death. The Mussaleem, however, in consequence of Mr. Manesty having interfered in behalf of the accused, abstained from conveying the sentence into effect. 167. The Jews subsequently in the presence of the Mussaleem and other officers of the Turkish Government apologised to Mr. Manesty for the insults they had offered him, and which apology Mr. Manesty accepted. Subsequently, however, Mr. Manesty received information that one of the principal Jews at Bussorah had written a letter to the Minister of the Pacha at Bagdad, in which he had spoken in slighting terms of Mr. Manesty. On receiving this information Mr. Manesty called upon the Mussaleem to render him justice for the insults he had on the above occasion received from the Jewish community (for which they had already apologised and which apology had, as above stated, been accepted by Mr. Manesty) by expelling the principal Jew of Bussorah, who had written the letter to the Pacha's Minister, and had also taken a con spicuous part in the insulis offered to Mr. Manesty from the town, and by punishing ten other Jews by fine, imprisonment, &amp;c. The Mussa leem refused to comply with this application, on the ground that atone ment had already been made to Mr. Manesty by the apology he had accepted. Mr. Manesty therefore made a similar requisition on the Pacha of Bagdad. 168. The Pacha after enquiring into Mr. Manesty's complaint ordered the ' principal Jew' to be sent from Bussorah to Bagdad, in order72 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I, COMPY. that he mig-ht be there punished. The Paeha ordered the Mussaleem to admonish the other Jews who had insulted Mr. Manesty, but refused to inflict any punishment on them. Mr. Manesty remonstrated against this decision, but the Pacha refused to afford him any further redress. Mr. Manesty and Mr. Harford Jones (who had been associated with him as a Joint Factor at the Bussorah Residency from the 20th November 1788) came therefore to a resolution, which they carried into effect on the 30th April 1793, to withdraw from Bussorah and remove to Grane, in the Persian Gulf, pending further orders from Government. 169. Consequent on the withdrawal of Mr. Manesty from Bussorah, the Pacha addressed the following letter (without date) to the Governor of Bombay:— ' The great friendship, good-will, and cordiality which have ever subsisted between me and the English gentlemen are confirmed. The integrity of my conduct and the great respect which, from motives of friendship, I have still this day shown to the English residents, passengers, and the merchants of your side, are too well known to need any explanation from me. You must likewise be informed how friendly, attentive, and civil I have been to all persons dependent on your Circar. But Mr. Manesty, the present Resident of Bussorah, is a man quite ignorant of either the means of pleasing or con ciliating ; his manners and conduct are bad. He before gave unreasonable interruption to the merchants and people of the town, and sometimes occasioned disturbances in the Government; lately he has been more and more troublesome, and, unmindful of the rules of friendship, has repeatedly caused uncommon disagreements. Although by submitting to such interruptions and disturbances I trust my own Government, and though conduct of this nature has a tendency to weaken the administration of the town, yet on account of the friendship subsisting between the Ottoman and English Courts, and of my regard for the English nation, I have forborne noticing it. Two years ago a Christian, not a ryot of Bussorah, or under the protection of the English factory, or any way connected with Mr. Manesty, had a dispute with one of the Jews, whom he unjustly murdered. The Mussaleem of Bussorah was desirous of having the matter enquired into and to have judgment passed according to the all bright law; but as Mr. Manesty then unacquainted with the Christian who was living under contribution in the town, took his part, the Mussaleem declined putting the law in execution. Not withstanding this attention in the Mussaleem in giving the matter up, Mr. Manesty was still dissatisfied, and demanded that, as in the dispute, abusive language had been made use of towards him by the Jews, for his own satisfaction, as a person of character, that the head Jew of Bussorah should be turned out of the town, and that the rest should be punished, disgraced, and fined, from the desire that there should be no interruption to our friendship. I attended to his demand, and ordered the head Jew of Bussorah to Bagdad, and punished and admonished the rest, but to impose fines on, and harass the subjects without cause, must be destructive of good government, and till this time none of my officers have ever acted so unwisely; they were therefore not fined on this occasion. ' Mr. Manesty finding that his wishes had not been wholly complied with was offended and, quitting Bussorah, went to Carrack, leaving the dispute as it was till the opening of the season, that when the crops were ready for gathering he might throw impediments in the way of cutting them, his doing which from the friendship that has subsisted with so much cordiality between the Ottoman and English Courts, upwards of thirty years, and the harmony that has so long continued between me and the Company, would be highly improper. My fair conduct and actions towards every one dependent on the English, towards you and his people from a long time back to the present day, have been fullv known, and it is also known how contrary his conduct has been to the rules of friendship. I have never been deficient on my part or ever will in observing a friendly line of conduct, but while Mr. Manesty continues to conduct himself, as I have above described, you must be sensible that his residing at Bussorah in future would be impro per, and of no use, and that it would neither tend to your benefit or mine his continuing there. I therefore hope you will recall him and send another Resident in his room, to whom, from our cordiality and friendship, I will show every civility and attention in my power, and in all respects act for the increase of our good understanding.'WITH TURKISH ARABIA —164G TO 1846. 73 170. Mr. Manesty^s complaint ag-ainst the Paclia and His Excel lency's representation above quoted were referred by this Government for the consideration and orders of the a Governor-GeneraP (Government of India), and in reply this Government was informed on the 18th November 1793 that the subject 'had been referred in detail to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors'; while this subject was under the consideration of the Hon'ble Court, the Pacha addressed several letters to Mr. Manesty, inviting- him to return to Bussorah, but Mr. Manesty refused to accept this invitation without a promise from the Pacha; that on his doing so his application for the punishment of the ten Jews above mentioned should be complied with; with this demand, however, the Pacha refused to comply. 171. On the 15th April 1795 the Hon'ble the Court of Directors addressed a letter to this Government, in which they reviewed Mr. Manesty's proceeding's on the above occasion, and expressed disapprobation of his conduct and directed his removal, and also that of Mr. Harford Jones (the Joint Factor). The Hon'ble Court at the same time directed that, after the arrival at Grane of a new Resident and Factor, they should, subject to certain conditions stated in the following extract from their despatch, remove to Bussorah and re-establish the Hon'ble Company's Factory at that place:— ' Having taken into our own consideration the advices and papers on the subject of the dispute between the Pacha of Bagdad and the Resident and Factor at Bussorah, we are of opinion that so far as respects their interference with the Mussaleem, in behalf of Risha, in the affair of the murdered Jew, their conduct was highly proper and praise worthy. But that after the satisfactory apology which was made to Mr. Manesty by the principal Jews in the presence of the Mussaleem and other officers of the Turkish Government, and which was deemed by the Resident an ample atonement for the insults which had been offered to him in his public capacity, we are much surprised and greatly displeased that he should have been induced by any private intelligence from Bagdad respecting a letter written by the Jew, Caja A1 Dulla, to the Pacha's Minister, containing improper sentiments and expressions regarding him, to renew his determination ot demanding justice and satisfaction from the Pacha for those insults for which an atone ment had been already made and accepted. To this evident want of judgment and foresight may be attributed all the subsequent disputes and embarrassments which terminated in the removal of the Company's factory from Bussorah, and the appeal which Mr. Manesty has since thought it necessary to make to His Majesty's Ministers for the final settlement of the disagreement between the Resident and Factor and the Pacha of Bagdad. It is on this ground, and because there appears no probability ot restoring harmony between the Pacha and Messrs. Manesty and Jones, that we have resolved upon the removal of the present Resident and Factor. We therefore direct that you select from among our covenanted servants fit and proper persons to succeed Messrs. Manesty and Jones as the Company's Resident and Factor, and that they proceed to Grane without further delay. ' As we are convinced of the necessity so strongly pointed out in Mr. Manesty s late despatches of the speedy retum to Bussorab of a liesident and Factor on the part of the Company, it is our direction that, immediately after the arrival at Grane ot the persons you shall nominate to those stations, they address a conciliatory letter to the Pacha, acquainting him that disapproving of some parts of the conduct of the late Resi dent and Factor towards His Excellency, we have removed them from their stations and appointed others in their stead, and that in order to maintain the good understanding which at present so happily subsists between Great Britain and the Sublime Porte, and to show our inclination to meet the wishes of the Pacha in this respect, we have deter mined that the punishment of the Jews by fine and imprisonment shall no longer be insisted upon as the condition of the return of the Company's Resident to the Bus sorah Factory, provided the Pacha will perform the promise he has made ot making such a return by every public token of respect to our nation. If, in consequence ot this application to the Pacha, he shall renew his invitation for the return ol our Resident and Factor, they are immediately to accept thereof and endeavour by every means in K74 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. their power to cultivate the friendship of the Mussaleem and other officers of the Turkish Government. Should the line here drawn for the guidance of the new Resident and Factor fail of producing the desired accommodation, they are to state all the circum stances to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, who will be instructed by His Majesty's Ministers how to act in consequence.' 172. On receipt of the above despatch Government (on the 15th September 1795) appointed Mr. Nathan Crow, then in Bombay, Resident at Bnssorah in succession to Mr. Manesty, and Mr. Peter LeMessurier, Joint Factor for that place, in the room of Mr. Harford Jones, with instructions to proceed to Grane and assume charge of those appoint ments with all practicable expedition. Mr. Harford Jones had, however, intermediately' proceeded to England overland on account of ill health. 173. On the 29th of the same month, however (September 1795), Government received a letter from Mr. Manesty, dated the 8th August, reporting that a Turkish officer of very high rank was then on his way to Grane, having been deputed by the Pacha from Bagdad on a Mission to the Resident to solicit his return to Bussorah, and in the event of his agreeing thereto, to escort him to that place. In a further letter, dated the 18th August, Mr. Manesty reported the arrival at Grane on the 9th of the same month of ' Ismael Effendi,' the ' Turkish officer above alluded to, with a letter* from the Pacha to the address of Mr. Manesty, couched in the most kind, friendly, and conciliatory terms,' inviting him to return to Bussorah, and promising that, in the event of his doing so, the ten Jews who had insulted him should be delivered up to him (Mr. Manesty) by the Mussaleem ' for personal chastisement and impri- sonment.' Mr. Manesty accordingly agreed to return to Bussorah, and left Grane for that purpose on the 26th of August (1795). Mr. Manesty arrived off Bussorah on the 2nd of the following month, and twof days afterwards made his public entry into the town and rehoisted the British flag at the Company^ Factory. Mr. Manesty stated that he had been received by the Mussaleem in the most friendly and honorable manner, and that the promise of the Pacha had been fulfilled of deliver ing up to him the ten Jews, above alluded to, for punishment. 174. On receiving this intelligence the Governor of Bombay addressed, on the 4th November 1795, the following letter to the Pacha :— ' The great proof you have given of your wish to be on terms of friendship with our nation, by having invited Mr. Manesty to re-establish the English factory again at Bussorah, has given me more satisfaction than I can well express. Mr. Manesty has written me a particular account of his reception at Bussorah, which was, such as may, to be expected from a friend. As Mr. Manesty is desirous of going to England, I have at this propitious time sent Mr. Crow to relieve him, whom I have desired to cultivate your friendship, and to whom, I have no doubt, you will show every attention. I hope you will at all times favor me with friendly letters, giving an account of your health and command me as your friend.' 175. Messrs. Crow and LeMessurier arrived at Bussorah on the 1st January 1796, when the former received charge on the same date of the Resident from Mr. Manesty. In a letter to the address of Govern ment, dated the 28th of the following month, Messrs. Crow and * There is no copy of this letter in the records of Government, f Namely the -Ith September 1795.WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1G46 TO 184G. 75 LeMessurier made the following remarks in regard to the then posture of the Hon'ble Company's affairs at Bussorah :— ' Of the state of the Hon'hle Company's credit and interests in Bussorah we cannot presume to speak with any confidence, until, from a longer residence, we may acquire more leisure, than we have yet heen able to command, to explore the mutilated docu ments and unconnected records of preceding times, to examine the foundation of our establishment here, and its rights, and to unravel the perplexity of recent transactions, and until we may derive more experience and opportunities to determine the present temper of the Government: this much we can decisively pronounce, that the influence and dignity of this Residency has suffered a shock, and that a jealousy and distrust seem to form the Turkish aspect as near as we have yet been able to contemplate it.' 176. On intelligenee reaching the Hon'ble the Court of Directors that the differences with the Pacha had been adjusted, and that Mr. Manesty had in consequence returned to Bussorah, and re-established the Hon'ble Company's Factory at that place, they rescinded their pre vious order for the recall of Mr. Manesty and Mr. Harford Jones. The following is an extract from the letter from Mr. Ramsay, then Secretary at the India House, to the address of Mr. Manesty, dated the 1st Ja nuary 1796, containing this decision :— ' The Court of Directors have received your several letters to the 9th of October last, and I am ordered to express their satisfaction at the establishment of the Com pany's factory at Bussorah, in consequence of the final adjustment of the long depend ing dispute with the Pacha of Bagdad, and it is peculiarly pleasing to them that our return to that place in your official capacity as Resident has been distinguished y every possible mark of respect to our nation. As a perfect reconciliation has happily taken place between you and the Pacha, of which there appeared no pro bability when the Court communicated their orders to the Government of Bombay, of the 16th April last, for a new arrangement of the Residency, and as they have every reason to be satisfied with your general conduct, and that of Mr. Jones, in your collective capacity of Resident and Factor, they have been induced to revoke the orders contained in that despatch for your removal, there being a possibility of this reaching you before those orders shall have been carried into execution.' 177. The above letter reached Bussorah on the 3rd April 1776, at which time Mr. Crow had been in charge of the Bussorah Residency for upwards of three months, but Mr. Manesty was still remaining at Bussorah on account of his pi'ivate affairs. In forwarding to Government, on the 5th April, a copy of the above letter, Mr. Crow and Mr. LeMessurier made the following remarks :— ' In company with the packet from the Hon'ble the Court of Directors which we now despatch, we have received two official letters to the Residency from the Secretary at the India House, addressed to the name of the preceding Resident (' Mr. Manesty'), of which we deem it incumbent on us to transmit you copies. Should these letters convey to your superior judgment what we have not conceived from them, namely, a suspension of our functions, or should further orders, contained in the packet we now forward, distinctly direct a recall of the gentlemen appointed here by you, and a reinstatement of those we replaced, it becomes our duty to apprize you that we have from our short experience here every reason to be confident that such a restoration would be attended with the most destructive consequences to the surviving portion of national credit we retain here, and to the interests of the East India Company in this establishment, and that the Pacha would regard such an instability in our public measures with contempt and indignation.' 178. Messrs. Crow and LeMessurier on the same day addressed a despatch to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, in which they stated that they considered that it would be in the highest degree injurious to the interests of the Hou'ble Company that Mr. Manesty should be re-70 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. t. COMFY. appointed Resident at Bussorah. The following- is an extract from this despatch:— ' It now becomes our duty, however delicate the office, to reply to your Secretary's letter of the 1st January respecting the preceding Resident, and his return from Grane to Bussorah, but previously, we beg leave respectfully to recall to your recollection the words of the last communication, we had, on the 25th February, the honor of making to you on the state of the Residency, and to submit at the same time to your notice our subsequent correspondence on the same subject with the Hon'ble the President in Council of Bombay. Our letter to you of the 25th February says that on the political state of your establishment here we must still decline addressing you, as the occupa tions and circumstances of our own charge are multifarious and perplexing, and the materials for forming a correct judgment as yet incomplete. We are animated with an ambition and indulge likewise the hope that when we shall have the honor of com municating on the subject our accounts may be such as to give you satisfaction and gain ourselves approbation. Our language soon after to the Presidency ot Bombay is still diffident, but more expressive of the state of the Hon'ble Company's credit and interests in Bussorah. We cannot presume to speak with full confidence until, from a longer residence, we may acquire more leisure than we have yet been able to com mand, to explore the military documents and unconnected records of preceding times, to examine the foundation of our establishment here and its rights, to unravel the perplexity of recent transactions, and, until we may derive more experience and opportunities to determine the present temper of the Government. Thus much we can decisively pronounce that the influence and dignity of the Residency have suffered a severe shock, and that jealousy and distance seem to form the Turkish aspect as near as we have been able to contemplate it. By these extracts we wish to press upon your observation that our style has hitherto been studied not to disturb by any alarm nor to hull a perfect repose upon the immediate state of your affairs here, but only to give satisfaction that we were vigilant and alert, and should come forward with our report upon your interests and concerns in due time and season : this principle in our cor respondence has originated from laudable, public, and liberal private motives in us ; we did not wish to draw much upon your time and attention until we might be able to present you at once with a perfect and satisfactory arrangement of your affairs, thereby saving you the unnecessary trouble and perplexity of attending our transac tions step by step and ourselves the odious task of exposing every wound and defect to view before we applied their remedy. ' The tenor of your Secretary's letter of the 1st of January will no longer admit our indulgence of the considerations we have hitherto obeyed. You have been induced to retract your sentiments and positive orders, and if not apprized may with equal generosity and as little investigation be persuaded to consent to a further revocation of a more serious nature at such a time when qualified to undeceive you and to put you on your guard against danger. Silence would on our part be treachery and delicacy a crime ; we therefore without hesitation advance to the duty which the faith in which we are pledged to you demands, by candidly declaring that three months' sedulous study of your interests and concern in this quarter and attentive xperience of local facts have not established in the smallest degree to our judgment the merit of that restoration of the factory upon which you have been graciously pleased to bestow your approbation, but on the contrary proved to our impartial, cool, and, we can add, competent estimation, that it has been a measure either ill judged or hurried; that the advantages over the Pacha, which remained after the extremity of moving to Grane have been either overlooked or forsaken ; that the foundation upon which your factory, as been again run up here is altogether to be suspected, and that the whole political edifice of this re-establishment is neither solid in its materials nor respectable in its appearance. In short it is a shattered house, still more disfigured but not strengthened by buttress and props. ' Your intentions to confirm our predecessors* are not the less honorable to them for having been impeded by our arrival, nor is the event, notwithstanding whatever their merits may be, unfortunate to the Residency, for it never in reason, nor human nature, could be expected that a cordial reconciliation could be established in the bosoms of those who had been in such long open hostility and avowed personal animo sity as have marked the late disputes, and the Pacha would from a glow ot triumph * Messrs. Manesty and Harford Jones.WITH TUUKISII ARABIA— IG'iG TO 1846, 77 have been ever prone to asanme, whilst, on the other hand, those gentlemen must have felt disheartened from trying any competition or making even proper resistance, from the consciousness of the troublesome consequences and abortive issue ot their former opposition. All the advantages we possess to compensate for our own inferiority and to force the difficulties with which a Residency, so deranged, salutes us, are that we are independent of any concerns here but yours, free from all prejudices against others, and exempt from any against ourselves, and perhaps no qualifications can be more requisite to us in the duties we have to prosecute at this station. From every inspection we have made into the Residency, and every view in which we could contemplate its purposes and relations, we have been early convinced of the necessity of examining all its parts afresh and of befitting them anew, rejecting whatever we might find useless or cumbersome, and supplying deficiency wherever we might discover it, which we have every confidence of being able from our own resources to do without any distant distracting references to you or to India. The conclusion of our labours. We have promised ourselves to be a machine simply, yet completely calculated to all your uses and purposes here, of a structure becoming the dignity of you, its proprietors, of a beauty, order, and convenience, of which the Pacha might be both admirer and partaker, and of a happy adaptation to its position and surrounding circumstances that might make it be viewed with complacency and pleasure by all beholders. This is the model after which we wish to form your factory.' 179. On the 8th July 1796 the Secretary at the East India House, by order of the Hon^ble the Court of Directors, addressed a letter to Mr. Manesty to the effect, quoted in the margin, which reached Bussorah on the 25th September following, informing him that the Court had re stored him to the office of Resident; the Court at the same time informed Mr. Crow that they were both surprised and dis pleased that he had not delivered over charge of the Residency immediately on the receipt by Mr. Manesty of their Secretary^ letter of the 1st January preceding, alluded to in paragraph 176, and directed that he would now forthwith do so ' without further evasion or delay.' Mr. Crow accordingly made over charge of the Residency to Mr. Manesty on the same day that these orders reached Bussorah (the 25th September) and shortly afterwards returned to Bombay, accompanied by Mr. LeMessurier. On the 8th November 1796 Mr. Manesty returned his acknowledgments to the Hon'ble Court in a letter, from which the following is an extract:— ' I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt, on the 25th September, ot your commands of the 8th July, with its enclosures, and to inform you that on the same day I received charge of the factory property and affairs in this country of the Hon hie Company from Mr. Nathan Crow and Mr. Peter LeMessurier, who returned to the Presidency on the Autelope on the 14th October. In communicating intelligence ul these events, I beg leave, with the plain sincerity of a grateful heart, to offer to you, Hon'ble gentlemen and to my Hon'ble employers, my most respectful acknowledg ments for your and their liberality towards me. If in the honor of your seventy, supported by conscious rectitude and agitated by a laudable resolution to assort my honor, I ventured with independent spirit to address you in manly, free, and animated language, I now, rejoicing in your favor, solicit your favorable acceptance ot those calm and harmonized assurances of uniform devotion to the service and interests ot my Hon'ble employers, which a mind, restored to happiness and reinvigorated b\ t le emplovment of returning honor and credit, feels it a pleasant dutj to otter. Ihe ' Enclosed you will receive a copy of a letter I wrote you, by order of the Court of Directors, on the 1st Janu- ary last, revoking the orders they had sent for removing you and Mr. Jones from the Residency, since which Messrs. Crow and LeMessurier have addressed the Court, under date the 5th April last, acknowledging the receipt of my said letter to you, and replying thereto by urging the Courts to recall these orders and permit them to continue in charge of the Residency: this letter has been under the Court's consideration, who have directed me to communicate to Messrs. Crow and LeMessurier their positive orders for their immediately delivering over to you the charge of^the Residency.'78 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. Hon'ble Company know me well, and they shall find me if my abilities equal my inte grity, and my constitution enables me, to prosecute my views and wishes, a servant worthy of their applause, attention, and support.' 180. During the year 1797 Mr. Manesty addressed several letters to Government, in which he stated that the most perfect cordiality existed between himself and the Mussaleem of Bussorah, and that the Pacha had from time to time communicated to him throug-h the Mussaleem his desire that the most perfect friendship should exist between his Government and the Hon^ble Company. In a letter, dated the 24th May 1798, Mr. Manesty communicated the following- intelli gence in regard to the then state of affairs at Bussorah and in the Bagdad Pachalic :— ' I am really happy in communicating to Government information that the affairs of the Residency are at present in a most prosperous state, and that I have not the smallest doubt of their very long continuing so. The conduct of the Turkish Government in all its departments towards the factory and myself is friendly, handsome, and satisfactory on the highest degree. My inffuence with it is as extensive as lean myself desire. My friendship a nd influence with all the neighbouring Governors and Shaiks, and with the distant Shaiks in the desert, enable me to command their services on all occasions, and the general inhabitants of the country are devoted to my wishes. In short, Hon'ble Sir, I have now attained the desirable object of those politic and prudential measures which have invariably characterized my public conduct as British Resident at Bussorah. The honor, the credit, the respectability, and the influence are completely and fir ml y estab lished, and the nation and the Hon'ble Company now in unequivocal enjoyment of all the advantages derivable from the possession of this valuable subordinate, advantages which I flatter myself I shall be enabled to preserve to them by the future countenance and support of Government. I have the honor very respectfully to inform you that the Pacha has been forced by the recent predatory incursions of the Wahabee Arabs, which have extended even to the banks of the Euphrates and the vicinity of Hella on that river, which town is within 50 miles of Bagdad, to determine to march a large army in the commencement of the ensuing winter into the territories of the Wahabee Shaik and to attempt the reduction of the town of Draeeah, his capital, and the destruction of her power and government. This warfare necessarily renders the passage of travellers across the desert extremely dangerous and precarious, but I encourage a hope that the messengers employed by me, between Bussorah and Aleppo, will continue to experience the beneficial effects of the attachment to me of the different Arab tribes, who inhabit the desert which has so long given security to the conveyance through it of the national correspondence between Europe and India.' 181. On the 5th July 1798, the Hon'ble the Court of Directors appointed Mr. Harford Jones (then in England), formerly ''Joint Factor' at Bussorah, ' Resident at the Court of Pacha of Bagdad,' at which place Mr. Jones arrived on the 24th of the following month, and assumed charge of that appointment. This appointment was made by the Hon'ble Court in supersession of a temporary arrangement made a short time previously by Mr. Manesty of sending a Mr. Reinaud to Bagdad, as Agent on behalf of the Hon'ble Company, and had in view amongst other objects the facilitating the transmission of news to, and from, India, and of watching the proceedings of French emissaries who were occasionally proceeding to, and from, India, through the Bagdad Paehalic, with the view as was supposed of communicating intelligence to General Buonaparte, who it was believed projected an invasion of India via Egypt and the Red Sea. 182. About the time this appointment was made, war was declared between Turkey and France, and on the 8th October 1798, a messengerWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 70 arrived at Bagdad from Constantinople, with orders from the Sublime Porte— ' to imprison the French Consul, the persons in his service, and the French subjects residing at Bussorah and to send the French Consul and the several persons in his em ployment, together with all the papers belonging to the Consul to Constantinople.' These oi*ders were on receipt carried into effect by the Pacha; similar orders were subsequently issued by the Sublime Porte and carried into effect in regard to the French Consul, and all French residents at Aleppo. 183. On the 4th August 1798, the following Resolution of the Bombay Government was communicated to Mr. Manesty:— ' The Bussorah factory expresses being ordered to be consolidated by fixed monthly allowances for the diS'erent articles of charge hitherto introduced into the accounts of that Residency, 1 am directed to inform you that the Governor in Council is pleased to allow you to draw for the purpose as follows, viz :— Bombay Rs, ' The coffee room expenses, dispense, &amp;c., charges, lamp oil, and wax candles, mats, &amp;c., seed and dung for garden ... 140 ' Allowance on account of iron and charcoal for smiths, teak-wood, window-glasses for the use of the factory, and repairs of all kinda to the factory ... ... ... ... 150* ' Allowance to the Surgeon on account of country medicines ... 24 ' Allowance in lieu of stable charges ... ... ... 150* ' Allowance on account of provisions to servants and entertain ments to inhabitants of Bussorah at Maghd, and the con veyance of necessaries from Bussorah to that place ... 150 'These sums are to remain invariable, independently of any fluctuations that mav take place in the rates of the relative value between this coin and that of tomans from the present standard.' 184. In a letter to the address of Government, dated the 17th December 1798, the Resident at Bussorah communicated the following- intelligence :— ' Kia Basha, with a considerable army under his command, arrived in the vicinity of Maghil on the 2iul instant, with an intention speedily to proceed on an expedition'!' against Hassa and Draeeah, the principal towns belonging to the Wahabee Shaik, the latter ol winch, Biaeeah, is his constant place of residence. Very great preparations have been made here, under the able management of the Mussaleeui, for the energetic prosecution of the expedition in question. The Kia is a brave and enterprizing young man ; the army consisting of about 5,000 Turkish troops is tolerably provided with rude artillery, and will be increased by near 10,000 Auxiliary Arabs of the different tribes, subordinate to the Fachalic of Bagdad and Bussorah and the season is well chosen for traversing the desert through which the Kia must pass to the districts of Hassa. On the arrival of the Kia, I necessarily paid him a customary visit, on which occasion I received with the most flattering marks of respect and attention the usual present of a horse and furnrture, and was unexpectedly vested with a very handsome Felisse, the immediate pre sent of the Facha, by whose command the Kia received charge of it, on his departure from Bagdad for the express purpose of delivering it to me, with a verbal complimentary message of the most satisfactory and friendly nature. During the stay of the Kia Facha in the vicinity of Bussorah a most amicable intercourse took place between us, and 1 have the highest pleasure in informing you that the Kia Facha, with an unprece dented degree of friendship and condescension unsolicited, paid me a public visit on the 11th instant. * Each of these two items was subsequently increased by Government to Rupees 200. f Peace was concluded between Kia Pasha and the Wahabee Shaik in May 1799. and Kia 1 acha left Bussorah on his return to Bagdad with his army on the llth July iollowing. ^80 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. ' The Pacha of Bagdad has since the date of my last address made certain political requests to me. Early in the month of July, a report prevailed here that Syud Sultan meditated an attack on Bussorah on account of certain ancient pecuniary claims of his deceased father, on the Pachalic of Bagdad, resisted by Soliman Pacha, and that in order to enable himself effectually to execute his hostile intentions, he was engaged in negotiating a peace with his formidable enemy. Seeggin Ebu Rasched il Mutter, the Jooaseme Saik, and towards the close of the month of July, this report was confirmed by the receipt here of letters from Muscat, communicating the designs of Seead Sid tan in greater detail. On the 20th August the Pacha invited Mr. Reinaud at Bagdad to a confidential conversation in which His Excellency represented to that gentleman, that his servant, the Mussaleem of Bussorah, had communicated to him intelligence respecting certain designs entertained by Syud Sultan of Muscat which considering the war in which he was engaged against the Wahabee Shaik, and the recent inimical proceedings of the French against the Ottoman Empire in the invasion of Egypt be felt to be rather of a puzzling and unpleasant nature, and desired in the most forcible and press ing manner that he (Mr. Reinaud) would immediately communicate to me his (the Pacha's) request, that as a still further and finally convincing proof of my friendship for him, and of my personal regard for his welfare and his interest, I would, without delay, write letters to Syud Sultan and to Shaik Suggur, strongly expressive of my hope that they would, on mature consideration, give up the idea of operating hostility against a friendly power, peculiarly connected by existing circumstances with the British Empire. Mr. Reinaud, in a qualified reply to the application of the Pacha, in which he carefully and prudently avoided committing either himself or the Resi dency, consented expeditiously to communicate to me His Excellency's important wishes. I received early in September Mr. Reinaud's private letter, and a letter from the Pacha on the subject, and the Pacha in his communication, which was a very friendly and satisfactory one, advised me of his having ordered the Mussaleem to co-operate with me towards the accomplishment of his desires. On the receipt of these advices, I instantly communicated with the Mussaleem, and expressed to him my intention to despatch two of the factory Janissaries without delay to Muscat and Razilkhima, charged with letters from me to Syud Sultan, and Shaik Suggur couched in terms even exceeding the ardent wishes of the Pacha. The Mussaleem in reply informed me that the active inclination, which I manifested to promote the interests of the Pacha's Government, could not fail very highly to gratify His Excellency, but that as he had himself written to Syud Sultan and Shaik Suggur on the interesting subject, and early expected their replies to his letters, he ventured to suggest the eligibility of my post poning my intended proof of friendship towards this country, until it might be possible further to ascertain the real intentions of Syud Sultan regarding Bussorah I willingly closed with the proposal of the Mussaleem. I despatched a chocadar belonging to Government to Bagdad, charged with a proper letter for the Pacha, addressed to the care of Mr. Reinaud, to whom I gave instructions respecting its delivery to His Excel lency. Mr. Reinaud presented the letter to the Pacha in person, and on giving it into his hands, he, in obedience to my orders, assured His Excellency that I should always have the highest pleasure in facilitating the accomplishment of his general wishes, and that on the particular occasion in question, I was ready to adopt any means for their attainment, consistent with good policy, and with the ancient amity fortunately subsist ing between our respective nations. The Pacha, after having read my letter with pleasure and attention, most kindly observed in his reply to Mr. Reinaud's communica tion that Mr. Manesty has now completed his friendship towards me. He is my real, sincere, and faithful friend, and I will always consider his wishes as my own. The Pacha then requested Mr. Reinaud to receive another letter for me, which would be sent to him on the following day for speedy transmission, and charged him to be most particular in his communications to me respecting the satisfaction which he (the Pacha) felt in my friendly conduct towards him. ' The Pacha's second letter, which was a peculiarly kind and pleasing one, con tained a request that 1 would preserve in my friendly disposition towards him, and take such measures in conjunction with the Mussaleem to prevent the threatened attacks of Seead Sultan, as I might deem politic and expedient, and tending to the preservation of his honor and the security of the country. Previous to the receipt of the Pacha's second letter, the Mussaleem received replies to his letters to Seead Sultan and Shaik Suggur. A negotiation commenced between the Mussaleem and Moolla Ibra him Ali, the Commander of the Muscat Annual Coffee Fleet then lying at Buchire, in which 1 did not find it necessary to interfere. The dispute between the Pacha andWITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 81 Seead Sultan, of which I had long foreseen the issue, has^ been amicably settled, the Muscat Fleet has repaired to Bussorah, and the usual friendly intercourse has taken place between the Turkish Government and the subjects of the Imam. 11ms, Honor able Sir, without taking one single measure or exposing the nation, or the Hon ble Com pany to the smallest political ditHculty, I have in the Pacha s estimation rendered him a most essential service, and given him the most unequivocal proof of my being autho rized by you, and personally inclined to promote his interests on all occasions. 185. On the 5th January 1799, His Britannic Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary at Constantinople concluded a ireaty of defensive alli ance with the Sublime Porte, having in view the co-operation of British with Turkish troops against the French Army under Buonaparte in Egypt. 186. In a letter, dated the 30th January 1799, the Resident at Bussorah stated he had reason to think that it might become extremely necessary that he should pay a visit to the Pacha of Bagdad, which Mr. Mauesty stated, from an ardent wish to communicate with him per sonally, His Excellency had been long desirous to receive. Mr. Manesty therefore solicited permission to proceed to Bagdad in the event of its appearing to his judgment politically necessary and likely to be productive of beneficial effects : In reply Mr. Manesty was informed on the 26th February 1799, that Government was desirous on account of the expense it would entail that he should dispense with his proposed visit to Bag dad, and that they could only authorize his doing so,— ' provided the exigency be of such a nature as could not be equally well answered through the agency of Mr. Jones,' the Resident at Bagdad. In consequence of this intimation Mr. Manesty abandoned his proposed visit to the Pacha. 187. During the years 1798 and 1799, Government complied with several applications from the Pacha to be provided from Bombay on his defraying the cost, with mortars, shells, muskets, gunpowder, and other munitions of war. The Pacha also requested to bn furnished for service with his army with an experienced gunner and an— ' able bombardier of the Mahomedan persuasion, who had been trained in the Military service of the Hon'ble Company in India.' With reference to this application Government, in August 1799, sent to Bussorah, and thence on to Bagdad, a conductor* and two European Gunner for the purpose of serving in the Pacha's army. 188. On the 15th October 1799, Mr. Manesty received an intima tion from the Right Honorable the Earl of Mornington, Governor-Gene ral of India, that Tippoo Sahib had sent an embassy to the Sublime Porte vid Bussorah, with presents for the Sultan and letters, re presenting— ' that the British Government tyrannically and cruelly oppressed Mahomedans in India,' » This person's name was Raymond. He subsequently occasioned Government consider able trouble in consequence of his having deserted and taken service under the t rench, as serting that his real name was ' Siddard,' and that he was of French extraction. He was afterwards appointed by the French Government their Consul at Bussorah ; successive Pachas refused for upwards of 20 years to surrender this person to the British (lovormuent. In 1826, however, he was finally surrendered and brought to Bombay, when, in consideration of the time which had elapsed, he was pardoned.82 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. and soliciting the assistance of the Sultan against the British. Mr. Manesty was at the same time informed of the death of Tippoo Sahib and the conquest of his dominions by the British : at the time Mr. Manesty received this intelligence, Tippoo Sahib's Ambassadors had arrived at Bussorah, and were on the point of proceeding to Constantino ple via Bagdad. Mr. Manesty accordingly informed the Ambassadors that, in consequence of the change of affairs since their departure from Seringapatam, it would be useless for them to proceed on their embassy, and he therefore advised them to return to India. This, however, they refused to do, observing that— ' if Tippoo Sultan had positively been killed in battle, and Seringapatam taken by the English still the children of their master might be alive, and that one of them might have succeeded to his throne and power, and been enabled by ability and good fortune to resist or overthrow the armies of the English,' and that as faithful servants of their late master, they felt it to be their duty to proceed on to Constantinople and represent to the Ottoman Porte the miseries and misfortunes to which the Mahomedans in India were subjected. On Mr. Manesty applying to the Mussaleem (of Bussorah) to prevent the Ambassadors from proceeding to Constantinople, he in formed him that he had received orders from the Pacha of Bagdad to allow the embassy to proceed on and to furnish them with the requisite means of prosecuting their journey to Bagdad. The Mussaleem stated that he dared not disobey this order, but that he had no objection to Mr. Manesty again endeavouring to dissuade the Ambassadors from further prosecuting their mission, and to in duce them to return to India. Mr. Manesty therefore at another interview with the Ambassadors pointed out to them the real situation of the dominions of their late master, their consequent position as British subjects, the eligibility of their acknowledging the authority of the British Government, and the necessity of their yielding obedience to it, at the same time explained to them the probable consequences to them selves of an obstinate resistance, and the state of misery to which in a foreign country they might be exposed subsequent to their arrival at Constantinople, where the Sultan could not possibly, on account of his political situation and connection with Great Britain, show them any favor or countenance; finally Mr. Manesty informed the Ambassadors that it was his positive determination not to allow them to proceed to Constantinople, but to send them to Bombay in the Hon'ble Company's ship Antelope, then on the point of departure for Bombay. Mr. Manesty however intimated to them that he rather wished such an arrangement to result from their own inclination than from compulsion, and assured them that in the event of their consenting to his wishes with cheerful ness, they might depend on the liberality of the Right Hon'ble the Gov ernor-General of India and on his (Mr. Manesty's) recommending them to the favor and patronage of His Lordship. After some delay the Ambassadors informed Mr. Manesty that they were willing to acknow ledge themselves British subjects, and that they therefore had resolved to abandon their intention of prpceeding to Constantinople, and were will ing to return to India by the first opportunity. 189. Previous however to the departure (on the 28th November 1799) of the Ambassador from Bussorah for Bombay, the MussaleemWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 83 insisted on their leaving- behind them the presents and letters of which they had been the bearers from Tippoo Sahib for the Sultan. Mr. Manesty remonstrated but without success against this arrangement, the Mussaleem stating that he was a servant, and that he might expose him self to serious danger by not transmitting the letters and presents to Bagdad, and which he accordingly forwarded to the Pacha. 190. In 1800 Mr. Harford Jones, the Resident at Bagdad, was seriously indisposed, and there being no European medical adviser at that place he solicited Mr. Manesty to allow the Surgeon attached to the Bussorah Residency to proceed to Bagdad for the purpose of attending him during his illness. Mr. Manesty however feeling himself unable to comply with the request, Mr. Harford Jones proceeded to Bussorah for the purpose of placing- himself under the medical treatment of the Surgeon at that station. In consequence however of a subsequent re presentation to Government from Mr. Jones of the dang'er to which he had been exposed from being without medical advice in the early stage of his illness, and the Pacha having about the same time expressed a wish that a British medical officer should be permanently located at Bagdad, that he might have the benefit of his medical advice whenever requisite. Government, in September 1800, appointed Mr. James Short, a Surgeon on the Bombay Establishment, Civil Surgeon to the Bagdad Residency. 191. In September 1800 Government complied with an application preferred by Mr. Jones for having a native guard attached to the Bagdad Residency, and a Jemadar, with 1 Havildar, 2 Naiks, 25 Sepoys, and a Drummer and Fifer were sent from Bombay to Bagdad for that purpose. 192. On the 28th July 1801, Mr. Jonathan Duncan, then Gover nor of this Presidency, recorded a Minute regarding the expense of the Civil establishment of the Bombay Presidency in its various branches. In this Minute Mr. Duncan took the following review of the expenses of the Bussorah Residency from the year 1788 to the date of his Minute.

He has also been allowed Rupees 40 per annum to furnish the factory, carpenters, and smiths with winter clothing, but the charge has not yet appeared in his disbursements. ' The above includes not any part of what may be termed the Political contin gencies of the Residency for presents to Arab Chiefs, the average of which cannot be taken at less than Rupees 16,000 per annum; according to the actual dis bursements from 1797-98 to 1799-1800 inclusive, neither does the charge of the transmission of mails to and from Europe make any part of the above expenditure, respecting which it may however be here remarked that by a statement delivered in by Mr. Fawcett on the 17th of March last, it appears that from the first establishment of these mails to the 30th of April 1800 there is a considerable net gain, after paying every expense incurred on this account here and at Bussorah.' 193. On the 9th June 1801, the Pacha of Bag-dad sent a message to Mr. Harford Jones to the effect that the popular feeling- at Bagdad had been roused against that gentleman in consequence, as was alleged^ of a Turkish female having been observed to come out of his house. The Pacha at the same time advised Mr. Jones speedily to quit Bagdad to avoid ill-treatment from the populace, and offered to render him any assistance, of which he might stand in need in making his escape, but at the same time intimated to him that unless he availed himself of this offer he (the Pacha) would not be answerable for the consequences. Mr. Jones declared that he was entirely innocent of the charge imputed to him, and therefore refused to quit Bagdad. The Pacha subsequently refused to recognize Mr. Jones any longer as the Representative of the British Government, and forbad any of his officers having communication with that gentleman, and at the same time informed him that he had with drawn his protection from him. Mr. Jones accordingly informed the Pacha that he had represented to the Right Hon^ble the Governor- General of India and to the home authorities the ill-treatment he had received from His Excellency in having an ex parte evidence, without having afforded him the opportunity of clearing his character, withdrawn his confidence from him and treated him with indignity, and that the Pacha might depend on it that the British Government on being acquainted86 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. witli the facts of the case would mark its displeasure of His Excel lency's conduct, and adopt effectual measures for preventing its Represen tative at his Court being a second time subjected to similar ill-treatment. The Pacha shortly afterwards sent for Mr. Jones and requested him to forget what had passed, promising that for the future he should have nothing to complain of in His Excellency^ treatment of him. Mr. Jones, however, peremptorily refused to resume his functions of Resident until he had received a written apology from the Pacha, and an admission that His Excellency was satisfied that the accusation which had been made against him was altogether groundless. The Pacha refused to comply with this demand, and Mr. Jones therefore withdrew from Bagdad and proceeded to ' Cootee/ situated on the banks of the Euphrates river, pending instructions from the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India, or from the home authorities, in regard to his further proceedings. Before, however, these instructions reached Mr. Jones, the Pacha, on the 20th October 1801, addressed the following note to Mr. Jones, containing the concession he required. Mr. Jones accordingly returned to Bagdad, where, on his arrival on the 20th November (1801), he was received by the Pacha with the usual honors, and resumed his functions as Resident at His Excellency's Court: — ' Having now minutely and faithfully examined the accusations which were here tofore brought against you, on surmise, we have found them to be false, and to be nothing more than idle reports, on this account we esteem it incumbent on ourselves to acknowledge the same to you, in order that you may on every account and on every respect be satisfied and at ease, and we call God to witness that from hence forward you shall be esteemed and regarded by us more than ever, and that our con fidence in you shall be greater than ever, and that your credit and consideration with us shall be greater than ever, and whatever business or affairs you may have hereafter, our desire to execute them to your satisfaction shall outstrip your own wishes.' 194. In a letter, dated the 18th April 1802, Mr. Jones reported that vaccination had just been successfully introduced into Bagdad by the Civil Surgeon of the Residency, by means of some vaccine matter which he had received from Vienna, on the 30th of the preceding month. During the following month vaccination was also successfully intro duced at Bussorah from vaccine matter received from the Civil Surgeon at Bagdad. 195. In the early part of April 1802 the plague made its appear ance at Bagdad, and rapidly assumed a very alarming form in con-- sequence of the Pacha having, on the first intelligence reaching him that this disease had appeared, withdrawn in consternation from the city, and adopted no measures for checking its progress. 196. In a letter to the address of the Right Hon'ble the Gover nor-General of India, dated the 9th May 1802, Mr. Harford Jones after describing the character of the Pacha, Solyman,* who had filled that office for a period of about 20 years, as being imbecile in the extreme, and that he had outlived his honor and reputation, gave the following history of Bagdad, and that Pachalic generally, and its then condi tion :— ' The fortifications of Bagdad, although most truly contemptible in the eyes of European, are nevertheless sufficient to defend it against the efforts of any Eastern » Solyman Pacha died on the 7th August 1802, being t iree months after the date of this letter.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 87 army ; but other circumstances render it evident that were it blockaded for but a few days it must surrender. The population on both sides the Tigris does not exceed 102 M. souls, for the support of which almost every necessary article is brought from such a distance and in such a manner that the interception of these indispensable supplies would be easy to the enemy. The single article of firewood is brought from a distance of 100 to 200 miles ; wheat is either brought from Coordistan or the country surrounding Mousul; rice principally from the country between Killah and Samavat. With an enemy before its walls, the want of forage would prevent the possibility of bringing any number of cattle into town, and those flocks which did not fall into the enemies' hands, the Arabs assuredly drive off to places of security in the desert. The plague has, my Lord, at the moment I am addressing Your Excellency, carried off near 2,000 souls; we hope the approaching heat will check its present progress, but we know to a certainty that its ravage next autumn and spring will be dreadful. ' The Pacha probably at the beginning of a blockade might mount about 2,000 horse within the town. The Janissaries, undisciplined and unruly, who probably, when distressed by the inconveniences of a siege, would turn like a wounded elephant on their own party, may amount to between 6,000 and 7,000: these with five hundred ragamuffins under the names of Barataties, Tuffingues, &amp;c., compose. ' In respect to Bussorah, Your Excellency no doubt has received from the Kesi- dent there more correct and detailed accounts of its present situation than I am able to give; but my own opinion is that it is as weak, defenceless, and hazardous a one as can well be imagined, besides which that unfortunate city can hardly hope to escape next year the visitation we are now suffering of the plague. ' The cities of Merden and Kerkook, which are dependencies on this Government, come so little within the prospect of this paper that is scarcely worth mentioning them, but the town of Killah on the Euphrates is without walls, without other means of defence. I have not a doubt left on my mind if things are left to go on in their present train, but the Wahabee, during the course of the summer, will make himself master of it. The moment that event takes place, Bagdad will begin to feel straitened for provisions, and the Carad Arabs, who from being Shyahs, might naturally be expected to surpass every other tribe of dependent Arabs in their willing ness and steadiness to encounter the Wahabee, will have no other alternative than submission to them or extermination. I fear Your Excellency will think I err if I tell you the Government here is so besotted as not to perceive the importance of the port of Killah, but on my honor, my Lord, this is the case. ' The principal military assistance, which in case of need the Pacha can make use of, is drawn from Coordistan, the greatest part of which country is now under the Government of Bagdad. That part of it which forms a part of the Turkish Empire is divided into Pachalics, Sangiacks and other species of feudatury possessions. The policy by which the Pacha of Bagdad has hitherto prescribed his authority there is that of alternately elevating and deposing its Chiefs. From time immemorial there have always been two families, or two branches of the same family, with equal pretensions to each Pachalick or Sungeach, and consequently one may say there is a Pacha or Sungeah Resident, and another expectant, who always resides, until this Government have occasion for him at Bagdad. Discontents and jealousies have manifested themselves to a considerable extent amongst the Chiefs of Coordistan, and although the Pacha since his departure from Bagdad has brought several of them to his camp, it is a well known fact that these persons measure their tribute and obedience according to the strength of the arm which enforces it. ' The principal tribes of Arabs dependent of this Government, and inhabiting the eastern banks of the Tigris, are the Benelarn and Sharner. The deposit Shaik of the former has within these few days attacked the Shaik lately appointed by the Pacha, and the country from Coole to Gissan, from Gissan to the environs of Haviza, is in an actual state of confusion. The Shumer Arabs have been on many occasions so cruelly treated by this Government that there can be no doubt of their joining the Wahabee whenever an opportunity shall offer. ' On the Euphrates and between the Euphrates and Tigris to the southward of Bagdad, the principal tribes are the Casaets, the Montificks, and the Mydan, the Casaet Arabs possess but little territory on the western bank of the Euphrates. The tribe is numerous, the men composing it are brave and warlike. The country extends88 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. to the southward as far as Samavat and abounds in grain, herds, and flocks. They are Shyiah, and when the Persians under Sadeh Khan attacked Bussorah, these Arabs joined him and were the principal means of his success. The injuries and extortions they have lately suffered from the Bagdad Government will at all events make them cool in its defence, and if the Wahabees will receive their submission they will pro bably be eager to rid themselves of Turkish tyranny. The Montifick Arabs possess the country nearly from Tamaval to the walls of Bussorah, and have hitherto been the bulwark of this Government against the Wahabees ; it is most interesting therefore to know what effect the Wahabees' late increase of wealth, power, and reputation, will produce on this tribe. The Government here has not certainly now the means of rendering them any effectual assistance ; they apparently are much too weak to defy the threats of the Wahabee, and being so are probably too wise to decline his invita tions to submission and proselytism should this happen. \our Excellency irom that moment must look on Bussorah as lost to the Turks. I cannot conclude this short and imperfect account of the Arabs under the Pacha's Government without repeating his own emphatical words, ' enfinit il faut pas compter ne sur les Tribes Arabes, qui out toules les yeuax sur les vehabes' which is verified since the afiair of Meshed Hossein, by two of the neighbouring small tribes, embraced their doctrines and received their protection. The only exterior relations of consequence and worth noticing, which the Govern ment of Bagdad has, are with Persia and the Wahabees. From the time the present royal family came to the supreme power in Persia, the Pasha of Bagdad has been obliged to manage every circumstance relative to the natives of that country with more delicacy and circumspection than was formerly manifested towards them. It is pretty generally credited that had the uncle of the present King lived much longer, he would have attacked Bagdad, and the conduct of Path Ali Shak, the present King, has frequently given cause of uneasiness and apprehension to the 1 acha. 197. On the death o£ ' Soliman ' Pacha of Bagdad, which occur red on the 7th August 1802, the Sublime Porte appointed the Minister* o£ the deceased his successor, under the title of ' Ally Pach.' On the Phirman from the Sultan conferring this appointment on the Ministei reaching Bagdad on the 6th January 1803, the latter addressed a letter, from which the following are extracts, to the Chairman of the Ilon'ble the Court of Directors, intimating his having been raised to the dignity of Pacha of Bagdad, &amp;c., and expressing his desire to continue on the same friendly footing with the Hon'ble Company's Government as his predecessor had done :— 'Prom His Highness Ally Pacha, Governor of Bagdad, Bussorah, Merdin, Kerbook, &amp;c., &amp;c., Lieutenant-General of Coordistan, to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors for affairs of the Hon'ble United Company of merchants of England trading to the East Indies.' ' And as nothing is more certain than that a long, sincere, and uninterrupted friendship was always observed between our predecessors, and the persons high in office of the English nation, which was so perfect in its nature, that what was a matter to the one was equally regretted by the other, and as we must suppose that ere now the decease of our late honored and glorious predecessor of famous memory, has reached your ears, and that on the principles of amity abovementioned it has created concern in your breast, we with pleasure embrace this fortunate opportunity of ameliorating your friendly sorrow by informing you that in these happy times, by the favor and special condescension towards us of the King adorning the throne, the Sultan, the refuge of the world, the Emperor endowed with the wisdom of Solomon, and the power of Jemshid, the Vizarat and government of these countries has been conferred on us as amply and fully as it was heretofore on our predecessor, and from the special grace of the great Kakan, the ensigns of the Vizarat, and the glorious mantle of investiture have an-ived at Bagdad. In consequence of which we have seated ourselves on the musnud of Bagdad 'both by the consent of the Emperor and by making apparent our just pretensions to it from family connection, and from tried valour; we are * Who was the son-in-law of the deceased Pacha.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 89 conscious the communication of this event will be highly agreeable to you, and that you will participate in the satisfaction we feel in reflecting that the Government of these countries, and the high station we now fill have not departed from the family of Soliman Pacha, so that if you, our honored friend, upon the sad tidings of his decease, laboured under the burthen of sorrow, we expect that when the present letter arrives you will gather with the hand of alacrity the bright fruit of gladness from the tree of hope. And the more so because in the same manner that the departed who now rests in Paradise, was assiduous, to cultivate the friendship of the great man of the renowned State of England, we shall in every manner uniformly endeavour to tread in his footsteps, and in view we hope you will consider us as always anxious to adopt those measures which may best contribute to strengthen and augment the happy union of sentiments, and the reciprocal performance of friendly actions which have so long been the object of each party. The wise have said friendship, and love our hereditary. These sentiments and principles with which we are strongly impressed, a,nd which we declare will ever guide our conduct with the illustrious English nation, are well known to the very respectable Mr. Harford Jones who resides a,t our Court, who loses no opportunity of promoting the mutual advantage of both States, and who is intimately admitted to our confidence, He will we are certain communicate with you more largely on these points, and amply bear witness to the sincerity of our present possessions. Under such circumstances, the rules of true friendship require that you, our honored friend, should consider the interests of the both States as one and the same and know no difference between them, in which case you will not deprive us of the pleasure of receiving your agreeable letters or the satisfaction of executing such commands as you may have in these countries.' 198. On the 16th January 1803 the Right Hon'ble the Earl of Elgin, His Britannic Majest/s Ambassador at the Court of the Sublime Porte, addressed a letter to Mr. Harford Jones, stating that the expe rience His Lordship had had of the interruptions to which Mr. Jones' residence at Bagdad was liable, and the intrigues to which he was exposed, from not possessing the same sanction from the Turkish Govern ment that every other accredited foreigner enjoyed within the Ottoman Empire, had induced His Lordship to avail himself of the opportunity which the recent appointment of a new Pacha to the Bagdad Pachalic had afforded, as a favorable occasion lor establishing a right to the establishment of a British Resident at Bagdad, and that His Lordship had accordingly obtained from the Sultana 'Burat' to that effect, conveying to Mr. Jones, the then Resident ' every privilege and protec tion in the same form in which they are granted in all provinces of the Empire. This 'Burat' or 'Imperial Diploma,' as it is termed in the original, was dated the 2nd November 1802; the only copy of this document on the records of this Government is written in Italian, from which 1 have had the following English translation prepared:— ' Translation of an Imperial Ottoman Diploma granted to Harford Jones, Esquire, British Consul of Bagdad and the environs.' ' At the request of Lord Elgin, English Ambassador to the Sublime Porte, in a memorandum given to me by him, to wit, that in consequence of the capitulations, the English Minister having named Consuls at the Ports of Aleppo, Alexandria, Tripoli of Syria, Algiers, Tripoli of Barbary, Tunis, Sio, Smyrna, Egypt, and other parts requiring Custom Houses, and wishing shortly to change or replace them by others, and having for the present assigned and established as Consul in the city of Bagdad and its environs Harford Jones, Esquire, a British subject, and residing in the said city of Bagdad, in order to protect the affairs of British merchants established there, or of travellers, I have given him my Imperial Bur at in conformity with the requisitions of the said capitulations, confirming and ordaining the said Harford Jones, Esquire, as Consul in the said city of Bagdad; that in conformity with the said capitulations the affairs of merchants and travellers under the protection of the90 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. British flag in this country, in cases of difficulty arising, should be referred to him, and that the departure of sill vessels should take place only under his cognizance; and that no public servants under his orders should be molested under the pretext of tribute, or certain regulations entitled Kharatz, neither of others named Avariz, nor of such as is levied by ships called Cassab Akeessi, or other arbitrary impositions called Tekialie Orfye; that no one shall exact the Kharatz nor other dues lor male and female slaves in his service, and that no person shall interfere nor obstruct the domestic on affairs of the said Consul, but, on the contraiy, they shall be free from all impositions according to the prevailing customs; neither shall they be subject to customs or excise duties; that the Consul being established by the British Ministers is not subject to imprisonment; that his house cannot be closed or searched, or have any body of troops lodged therein ; that assistants and slaves belonging to him shall be free and exempt from Kharatz* and Avariz,* Cassab* Akeessi* and from all Tekialie* Orfye* ; that any complaint made by any person against him shall be referred to me,t and cannot be disposed of by any other means; that should the said Consul find it necessary to travel into any part of the country either by land or by sea, and that at any stations or ports he may arrive at, no one shall molest him or his servants, or cattle, or baggage, guides, or anything connected with him; that any Captain of country vessels on being paid shall be compelled to carry his provisions according to the prevailing regulations, and that no one shall seek pretext for disputes against him; and that in dangerous parts of the country he is allowed to wear a white turban, sabre, bow, or other warlike instrument. ' That all Judges and Commandants or others shall not molest him, but shall assist and protect him, and shall prevent any one from throwing obstacles in his way, and always behave towards him in conformity with the capitulations, and that no one shall presume to oppose, but, on the contrary, give every credence to this decree given under my most respectable and noble seal. ' Given under my hand this 7th day of the moon of Rejib 1217, that is to say, 2nd November 1802, at our city of Constantinople.' 199. On the 4th April 1803 the residence at Bussorah of a Captain White, who commanded a trading vessel called the Recovery, belong ing to Mr. Manesty, the Resident, was attacked by the populace, and plundered of its contents, on the plea that a Greek Christian female, native of Cairo, who was living under the protection of Captain White, either was a Mussulmannee, or wished to embrace the Mahomedan faith, but was prevented by him from doing so. During this outrage the female was carried off by the populace, and several of Captain White's, servants were severely beaten. Mr. Manesty having, without success, applied to the Mussaleem (or Governor) of Bussorah, whom he charged with having instigated these proceedings, for redress struck the British flag on the forenoon of the following day, bricked up by the door of the British factory, and prohibited, until reparation should have been afforded, any intercourse between the British vessels then laying off Bussorah and the inhabitants of that city. Mr. Manesty at the same time addressed a letter to the Pacha of Bagdad, informing His Highness that unless he immediately issued peremptory orders for the restoration of the above female to Captain White, also removed the Mussaleem and Catiff of Bussorah, and indemnified Captain White the full value of his property which had been destroyed on the occasion of the above outrage, and punished by transportation, imprisonment, &amp;c., the ringleader, he (Mr. Manesty) would forthwith withdraw from Bussorah and proceed to Calcutta 'in order to demand justice from His Excellency the Most Noble the Governor-General in Council.' The Pacha on receiving this * These are Turkish words, t The Sultau.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —164-6 TO 1846, 91 communication informed Mr. Jones (the Resident at Bag-dad) that he would order an immediate investigation into Mr. Manesty^s complaint, and that the most ample redress should be afforded, if the result of the enquiry corroborated the representation made by that gentleman. 200. The Pacha subsequently removed the Mussaleem of Bussorah on the plea of incapacity, and ordered him to repair to Bagdad to answer the charge preferred against him by Mr. Manesty of having instigated the attack on Captain Whitens house; the Pacha at the same time ordered the new Mussaleem, whom he appointed to Bussorah, to try and punish, on conviction, all persons whom Mr. Manesty might charge with having taken an active part in the above outrage, and to cause all property which had been taken from Captain Whitens residence to be restored. The Pacha, however, declined to issue orders for the restoration of the female to Captain White, on the plea that his doing so would be opposed to the Mahomedan religion, in consequence of the female having, as was alleged, declared, previously to the outrage, in the presence of several Mussulmen that she intended to renounce the Christian, and embrace the Mahomedan, faith. Mr. Manesty, however, peremptorily refused to listen to any arrangement in which the restoration of the female was not made one of the conditions. The Pacha on receiving this intimation expressed himself to Mr. Jones as aggrieved by the uncourteous terms in which Mr. Manesty^s letter to him had been addressed, and refused to have any further correspondence with him on this or any other subject. On further consideration, however, the Pacha in the month of July following (1803) directed the Mussaleem at Bussorah to make the above female over to Mr. Manesty, and on his receiving her, he sent her round by the first vessel proceeding to Calcutta to Captain White, who had intermediately proceeded to that port. This female having been surrendered and the other demands made by Mr. Manesty having been complied with, he rehoisted the British flag at Bussorah on the 23rd July 1803, and re-opened the factory. 201. On the 16th February 1804 ' Soliman Aga' arrived in Bombay, en route to Calcutta, as Ambassador from the Pacha of Bagdad on a Mission to the Right Hon'ble the Marquis Wellesley, then Governor- General of India. In conformity with instructions furnished to this Government by His Lordship, the Ambassador was received with the highest honors, and during his stay in Bombay was entertained at the public expense, and treated with marked respect. On the 3rd April fol lowing the Ambassador left Bombay for Calcutta in the Ship Upton Castle, in which vessel a passage had been provided by Government for himself and suite. 202. On the 5th March 1805 Mr. Manesty proceeded to Bombay (on his own private account, and without previous reference to Govern ment), leaving Lieutenant E. H. Bellasis, of the Bombay Engineers, in temporary charge of the Bussorah Residency. In reporting his arrival in the Bombay Harbour in a letter dated the 10th April 1805, Mr. Manesty stated that for some time past 'he had been oppressed by the discovery that after a painful service in Arabia of more than 24 years' duration his longer stay in that country holding the office of British Resident at Bussorah, on the injurious and totally inadequate terms to which his public zeal had hitherto influenced him to submit, must have inevitably operated92 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. to his ruin, by involving him in public and private debts, which he might never subse quently have had it in his power to discharge.' Mr. Manesty then stated that being entirely unable to meet the demands upon him, he ' became alarmed for the security of the British factory, and the lives of the British gentlemen residing in it, and aware that his own immediate local resources were inadequate to the settlement of immediate local pecuniary claims on him, he figured to himself the possibility of the officers of the Turkish Government, and the general inhabitants of the place, proceeding to acts of violence against him, and against those under his protection, unless he could obtain a large sum of money ' for bills,' and that in order to extricate himself from his embarrassing position by being enabled to meet his private liabilities he had negotiated bills on the Bombay Government to the extent of ninety-three thousand rupees, which he earnestly hoped Government would honor on presentation, and trust to his hereafter re-paying whatever portion of this amount, on a final settlement of his accounts, it might appear he was a debtor to the Hon'ble Company.' Mr. Manesty concluded by observing that the office of Resident at Bussorah was ' one of the most arduous, unpleasant, and uncomfortable ones held by any servant whatever of the Hon'ble Company, and that it was unprofitable had, to his mis fortune, been indisputably proved. If, therefore,' continued Mr. Manesty, ' I cannot resume it on eligible terms, terms which I am ready respectfully to state and explain to Government, and on which only any gentleman can with prudence accept the situation. I shall most willingly resign it whenever you please, wisely prefer ring tranquillity, personal safety, and the most limited income in a British settlement to an extensive establishment, local rank, state, and authority, subjecting me to unceas ing care, laborious duty, serious dangers, and ultimate ruin in Arabia. If my past services remain unrewarded, if my just and reasonable claims are rejected, and if I cannot be Resident at Bussorah, under equitable, handsome, and profitable arrangements, I will in India endeavour usefully and honorably to exert those talents which have some pretension to consideration, and which ought long ago to have given me affluence in my native country. Unhappy as I have latterly been, I still possess that activity and energy of character which has enabled me never to absent myself from my public duty one single hour under any circumstance whatever from the year 1799 to the present day with a remaining portion of personal health and vigor, promising the capability of future effectual application to business, and I trust 1 may yet live to serve the public, my family, and myself.' 203. In reply, Mr. Manesty was informed on the 13th April 1805 that Government altogether disapproved of his having, in order to meet his own private pecuniary liabilities, drawn bills upon Government, and that it was expected that he would make arrangements for meeting each of these bills as they became due; he was at the same time informed that no increase could be made to his income as Resident at Bussorah. Mr. Manesty having, in reply, pleaded inability to meet these bills to their full amount. Government on the 19th April consented to accept, and honor when due, such portion of them as he might find himself absolutely unable to provide for, on condition of his lodging with Government efficient security for the repayment into the Hon'ble Company's Treasury of such portion of this amount as on an adjustment of his accounts he might be unable to establish to the satisfaction of Government he had a right to receive credit for. 204. On the 15th April 1805 Government directed Mr. John Law, then in Bombay, who a few days before had been appointed Assistant to the Resident at Bussorah, forthwith to proceed to that place and to receive charge of the Residency on his arrival from Lieut. Bellasis. Mr. LawWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 93 arrived at Bussorah on the 3rd July following, and received charge of the Residency and Factory from Lieut. Bellasis. Mr. Law, however, died shortly after his arrival, when Lieut. Eatwell of the Bombay Marine, who was then at Bussorah, took and remained in charge of the Residency and Factory until the return of Mr. Manesty on the 13th June 1806. 205. In a letter dated the 11th May 1805, Mr. Jones, the Resident at Bagdad, gave the following account of the then condition of the Pachalic:— ' The present state of this Government and of this country is most wretched, and everything appears hastily and rapidly approaching to confusion and revolution. In addition to the embarrassments the Pacha labours under from a quarrel which took place between the Gerba and Alabage Arabs, we yesterday received the un pleasant information that Abduraham Pacha, the principal Pacha of Coordistan, had put to death Mahomed Pacha, Pacha of the Koos Sangae, the Pacha of Coordistan, second in rank, dependent on this Government. Both these Pachas had but a few days before taken leave of His Highness to proceed to Coordistan for the purpose of bringing troops to assist the Pacha in an attack he meant to have made on the Alabage Arabs and their confederates for the defence of the Arabs of the tribe of Gerba. Abduraham Pacha on the road invited Mahomed Pacha to drink coffee with him in his tent and put him to death, after which, it is said, a skirmish ensued between the troops of these Pachas, which ended in Abduraham's making himself master of all the deceased's baggage, &amp;c.' A further letter from Mr. Jones, dated the 27th of the same month (May 1805), contained the following additional information:— ' Early in the present month the Chief Pacha of that part of Coordistan annexed to the Pachalic of Bagdad, without the orders of this Government, put to death one of the secondary Pachas of that country, and afterwards proceeded to various other acts of rebellion and contumacy. Shortly after the first of these events took place the Pacha deposed and imprisoned in the castle of Bagdad Khalat Beg, his Kia or Minister, together with Abdoolla Aga, connected with the Kia by marriage, and formerly Mussaleem of Bussorah. ' The Pacha is at present preparing to march against AbduA,ham Pacha, the rebel Pacha of Coordistan, and it is reported he will quit Bagdad in all the present month.' 206. In September 1804 a disagreement took place between Mr. Jones and the Pacha in consequence of a slight offered by His Highness to Mr. Jones' linguist. The Pacha refused to afford the redress Mr. Jones demanded, and subsequently His Highness declined having any further official intercourse with that gentleman. Finally, in November 1805, the Pacha addressed a letter to the Right Hon'ble Charles Arbuthnot, His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constanti nople, and also to the Sultan, requesting that Mr. Jones might be removed from the office of Resident at Bagdad. The Sultan's Minister, after the receipt of these letters at Constantinople, informed the British Ambassa dor that the Ottoman Government was determined to insist on Mr. Jones' immediate removal. The Minister at the same time informed the Right Hon'ble Charles Arbuthnot that if Mr. Jones any longer remained at Bagdad, the Sultan would not be responsible for his personal safety. The Ambassador accordingly, in a letter to Mr. Jones dated the 16th November 1805, advised him forthwith to withdraw from Bagdad pend ing further instructions from His Britannic Majesty's Government, for whose orders. His Excellency stated, he had referred. The Ambassador concluded his letter to Mr. Jones with the following instruction :— ' Although I should have wished extremely that you had been able to act in such a manner as might have prevented the quarrel between you and the Pacha from94 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. I proceeding so far as to affect the public service, yet I feel completely with you that in many respects his conduct towards you and to the persons attached to you has been unjustifiable. In this light I have represented it to the Porte, but not, I must confess to you, with sufficient effect to produce any change in its determination respecting you, as you are obnoxious to the Pacha. Whether it be from his fault, or from your's, this Government will not be at rest till it has effected your removal; and as His Majesty's 11 : 1 Government, closely allied as it now is with the Turkish empire, would not persevere in supporting a person whose conduct has caused displeasure, I fear very much that | you can have no alternative left but that of voluntarily quitting a post which you can no longer occupy either with comfort to yourself or with advantage to your country.' j T With reference to the above intimation Mr. Jones withdrew from Bagdad in the early part of January 1806 and proceeded to ' Monsul,' having made over charge of the Residency to Dr. Hine, the Civil Surgeon. On the 16th of the following month Mr. Jones left Monsul and proceeded to Alleppo, and afterwards to Constantinople, where he arrived on the 21st May (1806). While Mr. Jones was remaining at the latter place His Majesty's Ambassador at that Court addressed the fol lowing letter to that gentleman dated the 27th June :— ' In consequence of the intelligence received from Bagdad of an intended embassy from Persia to France, I think it very desirable that you should remain here for the present, as you might be employed with advantage to the public service either in obtaining information from persons attached to the embassy on their way through Constantinople, or in some other way connected with this subject. Your stay will also give me time to undertake a reconciliation between you and the Pacha, as the Porte has nothing to allege against you except your misunderstanding with the Pacha, which I have no doubt may be attributed to his violent temper. The Eeis Effendi did not scruple to write such a letter to the Pacha respecting you as I had recommended, and it is also my intention to write to him in similar terms * myself. Should our endeavours be successful, your residence at Bagdad may be attended with much greater benefit to the public service than it could have been while any misunderstanding existed; should the Pacha unfortunately not listen to my proposals, you shall at least have the satisfaction of returning to England with strong testimonials in your favor, as I can with trust declare that you have been meritoriously zealous in the service in which you were employed, and whatever may have been the Pacha's opinion to you, I can already assure you that the Sublime Porte has heard nothing, and has seen nothing, which would have occasioned a wish for your departure from Bagdad, if that Government was not permitted by the Grand Signor to consider itself as completely independent on all that relates to its internal regulations. I think you will do well in your letters to your superiors to recommend that a proper line may be drawn with respect to the duties and functions of the Bagdad Residency, that does not seem to be exactly the case at present, until the East India Company shall have made its arrangements in that respect. I will, in consequence of the peculiar cir cumstances of the present moment, both in what relates to you privately and what is of a public nature, take you and Dr. Hine under my special charge, and I will give you both such advice and directions as may appear necessary.' Mr. Jones forwarded a copy of the above letter to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors on the 28th June 1806, with an expression of his satisfaction in finding that his general conduct while he had filled the office of Resident at Bagdad was approved by His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and stated that the same principles which during a residence of nearly eight years at Bagdad had made him over look every personal consideration would cause him to return and re- assume charge of the Residency, if Her Majesty's Government and the Hon'ble East India Company should deem this measure advisable. 207. On the 13th October 1806 the Sultan of the Sublime Porte afforded a proof of his friendly feeling towards Mr. (who it appears had a short time before become Sir) Harford Jones, by conferring upon him -WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 95 the Ribbon and Star of the Order of the Crescent of the Second Class. On the 19th of the same month Sir Harford Jones proceeded to England by the Ambassador's request with despatches, which he was informed were of the utmost importance, at the same time receiving an intimation from His Excellency that 'if he liked ultimately to go back to Bagdad, he should go in any character or in any way he (' Sir Harford Jones') pleased.' 208. His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople having represented to the Sublime Porte that the rates of customs then levied in the Turkish dominions on British imports and exports were, in con travention of the stipulations contained in the Treaties, which form Appendix A. and B. to this summary, higher than those paid by other Christian powers, the Sultan on the 13th December 1805, in communica tion with His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador, sanctioned a new tariff to the effect of Appendix C. to this summary, and directed that the rates of customs therein ordered to be thereafter levied on British imports and exports should serve as ' a permanent rule.' 209. In reply to a reference made by this Government for the in structions of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India in Council, this Government was informed on the 21st January 1806 that His Lord ship in Council deemed it advisable and necessary that the Residents, both at Bagdad and Bussorah, should be placed immediately under the control of the Government of Bombay, and that those officers should correspond exclusively with the latter Government. It was at the same time left to the discretion of this Government what subjects connected with either of these Residencies should be submitted for the information or decision of the Supreme Government. 210. In a letter addressed by Mr. Manesty to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, dated the 26th September 1806, he communicated the following information in regard to the amount which had been realized up to that period from the 1st May 1791 on account of the Hon'ble East India Company's share in the customs and consulage dues at Bus sorah, and stated that a certain prospect existed of a very large augmen tation for the future in the amount of these realizations :—' ' You will no doubt be much surprised that whilst the collection of customs and consulage here between the 1st May 1791 and the 1st of May 1806, or a long period of 15 years, only amounted to the sum of Rupees 27,512-2-44, the receipt of July alone on those accounts was Rupees 41,663-08, and the satisfaction which will result from the reflection on the circumstances will be essentially increased by the assurances which I have now the honor to give you, that the further collections of customs and consulage here between the 31st July and the 30th April next will, at least, amount to the additional sum of Rupees 20,000, and that as long as I may continue in office here, the annual amount must generally exceed, and possibly in a material degree the large sum of Rupees 50,000.' 211. On the 19th February 1807 His Britannic Majesty's Am bassador at Constantinople, under orders from the Home Government, withdrew from that Court, and friendly relations were declared to have ceased between Great Britain and Turkey. The Pacha of Bagdad in the first instance intimated to the British Residents at Bagdad and Bussorah that he wished them also to withdraw from their respective charges; but subsequently, however, informed them that he was desirous that they should remain, and promised them protection, both as regarded96 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. their persons and property, whether private or public : both of these officers therefore resolved to continue in charge of their respective Residencies. This resolution was approved by the Government of India. 212. On the * June 1807 an insurrection took place at Constantinople, which ended in the deposal, and subsequent assassination, of ' Selim,' Sultan of the Sublime Porte, and the elevation to the Ottoman throne, under the name of Mustapha, of Beram, son of Abdool Hamid, a former Sultan. 213. On the 18th August following 'Ali' Pacha of Bagdad was assassinated by a party of Georgians, and in consequence of this event Kia Pacha, the Minister of the deceased, assumed, by general consent, charge of the Government of the Pachalic, pending a reference to Constantinople. In reporting this event, Mr. Hine, the Acting Resi dent at Bagdad, stated that the death of Ali Pacha had diffused a general satisfaction throughout the Pachalie, and that he was of opinion that the interests of the Hon^ble East India Company in Turkish Arabia would in consequence be greatly promoted. On intelligence of the death of Ali Pacha reaching the Sultan, he appointed ' Soliman, w nephew of the deceased. Pacha of the Bagdad Pachalic. 214. Sir Harford Jones was, on the 24th September 1807, delegated by His Majesty's Government on a special mission to the court of the King of Persia. The Bombay Government therefore deemed it unneces sary to keep the situation of Resident of Bagdad any longer open for Sir Harford Jones, and accordingly, on the 16th January 1808, Mr. Claudin James Rich of the Bombay Civil Service was nominated f to that appointment. 215. On the 9th February 1808, Mr. Jonathan Duncan, then Governor of Bombay, addressed the following letter to Soliman Pacha, congratulating him on his accession to the Government of the Bagdad Pachalic, and intimating the appointment of Mr. Rich as Resident at Bagdad, in succession to Sir Harford Jones:— ' The Government has seen with the greatest satisfaction the accession of His Excellency to the Pachalic of Bagdad, and offer their sincerest congratulations to him on his new dignity, which it hopes he may enjoy for a long series of fortunate years, with increasing prosperity, doubting not but that his Government will eclipse the splendour, not only of all the former Valis of Bagdad, but even of his illustrious uncle, the late Vizier Soliman Pacha. The Government ever anxious to preserve the relations of friendship and amity which have subsisted from time immemorial between the British Governments in India and the Valis of Bagdad, but more especially with the late Soliman Psujha, have appointed a new Resident, Sir Harford Jones, the former Resident at the Court of the Pacha having heen removed to a different service, and have charged him with their congratulations to His Excellency, and empowered him to strengthen and confirm the bonds of alliance. The Government for this purpose has made choice of Mr. Rich, a person whose acquaintance with the language and manners of the East (having already resided^ a considerable time in the dominions of the Sublime Porte), they hope, cannot fail of being acceptable to His Excellency. Ha is in possession of the entire confidence of Government.' * The precise date cannot be ascertained from the records. t Mr. Rich arrived at Bagdad on the 4th May 1808, and on the same day received charge of the Residency from Dr. Hine. t As Consul General in Egypt.WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 97 216. On the 29th January 1808 the Resident at Bussorah for warded to Government translation of a Consulary Birat whieh had been granted in the year 1763* by the Sublime Porte to Mr. Robert Garden, then Resident at Bussorah. This Birat, Mr. Manesty stated, had a few years before been confirmed in his own name by the deceased Sultan Selim on the application of the Rig-ht Hon'ble the Earl of Elgin, when Ambassador at Constantinople, but that he had mislaid the document containing this confirmation. This Birat was forwarded to Government iii reply to a call made upon Mr. Mauesty to do so, in consequence of his having- made frequent allusion thereto, and no report having been made to Government by Mr. Garden at the time it was granted by the Sublime Porte or subsequently by the succeeding Residents at Bussorah. This Birat was to the following effect:— ' In these times the English Ambassador residing at our Court, Henry' Nevile, Esquire, has presented to us a formal memorial to the following effect: that the Envoy at Aleppo, Alexandria, Tripoli in Syria, the Grenan Islands towns, Tripoli in Barbary, Laker, bmyrna, and Egypt, and all the other considerable towns, having scales or ports in our dominions, may have the power of appointing Consuls of their own nation, and in the event of their choosing to change any of them and appoint others in their room, that no person may be permitted to interfere or prevent such an arrangement. Now, be it known that former agreements have established this, moreover it appears that before the present period the East India Company had sent a person to Bussorah, by name William Shaw, Esquire, to represent them and to superintend their affairs, who was not possessed of any Consulary Birat, but at the expiration of his period of service and his removal they appointed in his room the bearer of these Royal letters, liobert Garden, Esquire, who was also furnished with a Commission from the Company ; now, according to the tenor of former engagements, as well as in compliance with the wishes of the Ambassador, it became proper and necessary to deliver the Birat in question into his hands. We have accordingly consigned to him our Royal Diploma. ' According to what we have written the aforesaid Robert Garden, Esq., is con stituted British Consul, under the regulations to be here explained by us, as well in regard to his latitude of action, as the conduct to be observed towards him :— ' I«^. - He is a nominated and appointed Consul at Bussorah. ' 'Ind. —He shall have full and sole power of taking cognizance of all affairs con cerning those of the nation to which he belongs, such as Captains of ships, merchants, and also all who may be under the protection of the English flag, all matters relating to the above are to be under his peculiar care. ' Without his written order no English vessel shall be permitted to come to Bussorah. The servants of the Consul shall not be subject to the poll-tax or an3' other species of tax tribute. Their butchers shall not pay any duty, and in fine the aforesaid description of persons must be protected from any kind of contri bution. In the event of their purchasing male and female slaves, they shall also be exempted from the abovementioned duties. No person shall interfere in respect to their furniture, their eatables, or drinkables, for these have been privileges of old standing, such articles, too, shall be free from customs. No person shall dare to imprison or put in fetters the Ambassador, the Consul, or their Agents, neither shall they seal up their houses; and should the Consuls, where they reside, have with them a military detachment and wish to place them in separate houses, let none molest them for so doing. ' We repeat that their male and female servants are to be exempted from taxes, as are their butchers from duties. All which exemptions are of old. ' In the event of the Consul conceiving himself aggrieved, or any person having cause of complaints against him, we, in conformity to former agreements, hereby * f his Consulary Birat differs very materially from the •'Birat' granted by the ' Porte on the 29th August 1764.

Should the aforesaid Consul happen to travel whatever part he may choose to visit, either by sea or land, he, his suite, servants, cattle, and goods shall be sacred from any harm, and upon his return, should he, from not being provided with a stock of necessaries, wish to make requisite daily purchases on the road, let none refuse to supply him, or dare to engage in disputes with him. In places where danger may be apprehended, they shall be permitted to wear a turban and a sword, to ride horseback, to carry the bow and spear and all other appurtenances of war, and whatever Cuthys or others should see them so provided they are not to molest them. But should they exceed the bounds of these agreements, privileges, and concessions, you are to check and prevent them for such salutary restraint, and observance of good order is necessary. To all future times these regulations and instructions shall be valid, for we will not suffer the least infringement thereof, nor shall we sanction any excess.' 217. In consequence o£ reports having reached the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India that the French and Persians had entered into an agreement to invade India with a joint army, and that French emissaries had been deputed to Bagdad to endeavour to induce the Pacha to join in the design, Lieutenant-Colonel (afterwards Major- General Sir John) Malcolm was, in March 1808, appointed* Plenipoten tiary and Political Agent in the ' Persian Gulf' on the part of the Right Hon^ble the Governor-General of India, and Envoy Extraordinary from His Lordship to the ' King of Persia and the Pacha of Bagdad,' with the local rank of Brigadier-General. On this arrangement, which vested for the time being in Brigadier-General Malcolm ' the direction and control of the Bagdad and Bushire Residencies,' being intimated to Mr. Manesty, he addressed a letter to this Government, dated the 5th June 1808, from which the following is an extract, in which he com plained of his authority in Turkish Arabia having been interfered with, and foreboded injurious results in consequence :— ' It is now to be ascertained what will be the result of the suspension of my official powers, and I will candidly confess both to you, Hon'ble Sir ,t and to General Malcolm, who will have the perusal of this address, that, although my reliance on his judgment, resources, and disposition towards me operates materially towards the conservation of confidence on my mind, I really dread the idea of its becoming known either to the Pacha, his Minister, or the Mussaleem, either by accident or intentional intimation, that I am no longer vested with a high degree of official latitude and authority in this part of Arabia: conscious that possessing my late public powers, and countenanced and supported by the authority of Government to exert them with energy and animation, I could latterly have interested in our cause against the French almost the general population of the country ; I must on public as well as private grounds lament that they are become imaginary ones. Periods of morti fication and difficulty are, however, the proper seasons for resolution and mental exertions, and the Eight Hon'ble the Governor-General, you, Hon'ble Sir, and General Malcolm himself, may be convinced that superior to personal feelings and consoled by the influence on my mind of the present sentiments of patriotic zeal and inflexible integrity, I will, with pleasure, attempt the effectual execution of such political plans as General Malcolm may, in the perfonnance of his important duties, form and commu nicate to me, devoting to the chance of their success the whole of my ability and experience, and the utmost activity and decision, of which my nature is capable.' 218. On the 31st March 1808 Mr. Manesty solicited either that ten troopers belonging to the Bombay cavalry might be sent to Bussorah, * Brigadier-General Malcolm reached Bussorah on the 25th September 1810, on his return from this Mission, and proceeded to Bombay, where he arrived ou the 23rd of the following month. f The Governor of Bombay.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 99 and attached to the Residency, or that he might be permitted to engage on the spot ten Turkish troopers at a total monthly expense of Rupees 150. Neither of these applications were complied with by Government, on the ground that the arrangement was unnecessary. 219. The Pacha of Bagdad having opened and made himself acquainted with the contents of an official letter which had been addressed by Mr. Manesty on the 21st March 1808 to Dr. Hine, then Acting Resident at Bagdad, which Mr. Manesty had forwarded to that gentle man through the Mussaleem at Bussorah, Mr. Manesty on the 27th April 1808 addressed a letter to the Pacha, from which the following is an extract, calling upon His Excellency for an explanation of the cir cumstances which had induced him to 'commit this unjustifiable and unhandsome proceeding. Placing entire confidence in your honor and in your assurances of attachment to me and to my country, I have carried on my public correspondence with Mr. Hine uniformly through the Mussaleem by means of the Chocadars belonging to Government, and when I delivered the last packet to the Mussaleem for transmission to Bagdad by Ismail, I considered it as safe as if I confided it to the care of any of my own immediate people, what then must have been my surprise when on the 9th instant I received a written intimation from Mr. Hine that you had, in direct departure from the established customs of all civilized nations, and with a complicated degree of treachery, broken open my packet. Your Excellency has abused the liberal confidence reposed in you, despised the sacred secrecy of a seal, betrayed to the faithless* enemies of the British nation the official despatches of a British Representative, and you have not hesitated to acknowledge your proceed ings in a message to Mr. Hine, what is now my situation? Your Excellency has been pleased not only to destroy the very foundations of confidence, but to unlink the chains of amity. Previously persuaded that, although residing in an hostile country, its ruler as my friend, I was satisfied and happy; my mind is now filled with doubt, suspicion, and distrust, and I will not conceal from Your Excellency that I fear you allow yourself to be influenced in your conduct by French influence and intrigue. Mr. Rich will cause this letter to be delivered to Your Excellency, and I expect that you will without delay, in reply, explain to me what kind of report I am to make to the British Gov ernment on the subject of your late unjustifiable and unhandsome proceedings. I have hitherto represented you in all my public communications as a person of superior honor and understanding, and as a real friend to my nation and to myself; shall I now say that you are inclined to loose the ties of amicable intercourse with India, and that you meant not to abide by those engagements which have alone influenced the Governor-General and the Governor of Bombay to permit the continuance of British establishments at Bagdad and Bussorah, and to maintain amicable relations with you. Express your sentiments, in order that I may expeditiously transmit them to Bombay and receive the consequent command of my superiors.' On Mr. Manesty's letter—forwarding copy of his communication to the Pacha, from which this extract is taken—reaching this Government, he was directed in reply to inform Brigadier-General Malcolm of the circumstance of the Pacha having opened the packet alluded to, and leave the adoption of any further measures to that officer. 220. In reply to Mr. Manesty's letter the Pacha expressed surprize at the strong tone in which that communication had been written, but promised that for the future Mr. Manesty's packets to Bagdad ' should never be opened, nor their contents made known to any person whatever.' * Meaning the French.100 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 221. Iii a letter dated the 20tli February 1809 the Resident at Bussorah reported that on the 5th of the preceding- month a Treaty* of peace had been concluded between Great Britain and Turkey. In report ing this event Mr. Manesty stated that he was convinced that the cordi ality, moderation, and forbearance which had been observed towards the inhabitants of Turkish Arabia by the British Executive Government in India and by himself locally during- the late period of hostility between Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire had made a very favorable im pression throughout the Pachalic, and had had the effect of increasing the British influence in that quarter in an eminent degree. 222. Mr. Rich, the Resident at Bagdad, having during the year made several complaints that he was not treated with that general respect and attention by the Pacha which, as the British Representative His Excellency's Court, he had a right to expect, and that on several recent occasions he had been subjected to marked rudeness by the Pacha, Mr. Jonathan Duncan, then Governor of this Presidency, addressed the following letter to His Excellency on the 11th November 1809. Previous, however, to the receipt by the Pacha of this letter, the further indignities to which Mr. Rich had been subjected were of such a nature as to induce him to withdraw from Bagdad and to encamp at a distance from that city 'I avail myself of this opportunity to enquire after Your Excellency's prosperity, and to renew my assurances of friendship and good-will towards Your Excellency's person and Government. At the same time I deem it necessary to make Your Excellency a friendly communication on the subject of the situation of the British Representative at the Court of Bagdad, and to lay every circumstance connected with his office before Your Excellency. Having in view the dignity of the State and importance of the office, appointed Mr. Rich to the situation of Resident at Your Excellency's Court; it is almost needless to say that this officer is in possession of my full confidence, and that all his measures in his representative character must be considered as authorized by me, and consequently shall ever be accompanied by my fullest countenance and support, and I shall naturally feel myself flattered by any marks of attention and politeness shewn to him, and proportionally hurt at any show of neglect or encroachment on the rights and privileges of the Resident, or any attempt to derogate from the dignity of his official character, such as by interference in any of his plans connected with the public service, or the establishment necessary to support the respectability of his situation. ' It is unnecessary to recall to Your Excellency's recollection the treatment your predecessor's Envoy, Hadjee Soliman, experienced in India. This Government claims for its Representative consideration similar to that, and also to what every other power affords to British Residents; it is equally unnecessary to point out to a person of Your Excellency's discernment the advantages of the British alliance, and which party would be a sufferer by the cessation of it. But it may possibly be requisite to hint that the disputes between the late Resident and your predecessor have not escaped the serious attention and animadversion of this Government, which was induced to look it over from reasons principally connected with Your Excellency's accession to the \ izierat of Bagdad, and its wish to believe Your Excellency would be actuated by far different views. So far I have deemed it expedient to intimate to you in the way of friendly communication : though I have everything to Lope from Your Excellency's well known amicable dispositions, yet I wished to preclude the possibility of any unpleasant circumstances arising to interrupt the harmony and good understanding- which I am so desirous should be maintained between the two States, which circuin' stances might arise, not from any unfriendly disposition of Your Excellency, but merely from the want of having the representative character and my sentiments on * Vide Appendix D.WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 101 the subject clearly pointed out to you. I here renew my professions of the sincerest attachment and highest consideration.' 223. In a letter dated the 28th Jauuary 1810 Mr. Rich reported that ' the dispute between the Pacha and himself had at length been brought to a most honorable conclusion.' Mr. Rich stated that the Pacha on receiving the above communi cation from Mr. Governor Duncan had sent a message to Mr. Rich stating that he was desirous to be reconciled to that gentleman, and promised that if he would return to the Residency, he would for the future grant ' Mr. Rich more honors than had ever been previously shown to any Resident; that he would never interfere in any shape in the affairs of the Residency, the national privileges, nor the State and establishment of the Resident, whatever it might be.' Mr. Rich, however, informed the Pacha that he had so frequently made similar promises, which he had failed afterwards to observe, that the only condition on which he could agree to return to the Residency was by the Pacha consenting in writing to the following agreement and binding himself down to the due fulfilment of its conditions. To this the Pacha, after some demur, gave his unqualified consent, and on the 25th January 1810 the Pacha addressed a letter to Mr. Rich in which he engaged to observe these conditions which were to the following effect:— 'Article I. ' The Pacha must renounce all species of authority or command in any shape over the Resident, as such is neither warranted either by usage or the Treaties. 'Article II. ' The Pacha shall never on any pretext whatever interfere in any manner with the affairs and arrangements of the Resident respecting his establishment, his customs and rights, his beating drums, &amp;c., &amp;c., and there shall be on no account objections made to any of the Resident's orders, as such matters in no way concern the Pacha, nor come under his cognizance, particularly there shall be no objection made to the celebra tion of His Britannic Majesty's birth-day in the most public manner, with all the necessary ceremonies. In a word, there shall be no species of objection or interference in any of the Resident's states and ceremonies. 'Article III. ' The Pacha shall never prohibit the customary interchange of visits between the great officers of the Turkish Government and the Resident. 'Article IV. ' The Resident has never nor will ever show the least disposition to any undue interference in the Pacha's affairs or Government, and will show every readiness to comply with the Pacha's wishes, provided they do not interfere or are not contrary to any of the Articles of this Treaty, or the interests of the British Government, and so it is agreed for the benefit of both parties. 'Article V. ' Whenever the Pacha shall have any business with the Resident, he shall make it known to him by one of his own confidential men of rank ; also should the Resident102 PRECIS OP INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OP E. I. COMPY. ever have any important business, and demand a confidentisl person on the part of the Pacha to converse with, there shall be no objection made to it, and the person required shall be immediately sent: the benefit arising from this Article are clearly reciprocal. 'Aeticle VI. ' There shall be no equivocation on any of these Articles. Should any doubts hereafter arise relative to any particular contained in the Articles (especially Article II.) the explanation of it shall be in favor of the Resident.' 224. The Pacha sent the above agreement to Mr. Kich (on the 25th January 1810) in charg-e of the second officer of the Palace, with a retinue of 200 Georgians, with orders to escort that gentleman into Bagdad. Mr. Rich accordingly returned to Bagdad and two days afterwards (the 27th January) paid a 'public ceremonial visit' to the Pacha, on which occasion he was invested by His Excellency with a Pelisse, and received a present of a horse with housings, his assistant (Mr. Hine) and Dragomen being at the same time invested with Pelisses. 225. The Pacha on the 1st February 1810 addressed a letter to Mr. Governor Duncan, informing him of his reconciliation with Mr. Rich, and engaging strictly to observe the whole of the conditions embraced in the Articles of the Agreement above alluded to. 226. In reply to repeated calls made upon him by this Govern ment by order of the Government of India, Mr. Manesty, after consider able delay, forwarded, on the 20th December 1809, the following informa tion in regard to the Turkish import and export duties levied at Aleppo, Bagdad, Bussorah, and Constantinople. These statements were forwarded by this Government to the Government of India on the 27th January 1810:— Statement of Turkish duties, import, collected; at Bagdad, native property, according to the regulations of the Custom House of the present* day, viz.— 7^ per cent. n 71 h 8i 9| Piasters per chest.

In a despatch to tins Government dated the 30th August 1809, which reached Bombay on the 27th February 1810, the Hon^ble the Court of Directors took a general review of Mr. Manesty's conduct towards the Bombay Government during the period (about 25 years) he had tilled the appointment of Resident at Bussorah, which they designated as having on many occasions been in the highest degree insubordinated.104; PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. The Court concluded this review by expressing- their disapprobation that after such repeated acts of misconduct and frequent utter disregard to the orders of the Bombay Government as Mr. Manestv had evinced, he had been permitted to continue in the situation of Resident at Bussorah. The Court accordingly directed Mr. Mauesty's removal from that appoint ment, and prohibited, pending their further instructions, his re employment 'in any diplomatic or foreign missions.' The following is an extract from the Hon'ble Court's despatch containing these orders:— ' Mr. Manesty has so repeatedly shown a disposition to be guided by other rules and principles than those with which he has been furnished by his superiors, and has exhibited such a total want of judgment and discretion on many occasions, that we feel it to be an indispensable duty to express our disapprobation of your having so lone permitted his continuance in the situation of Resident at Bussorah, and to direct thai in case he shall not have resigned or been recalled previous to the arrival of this despatch, he be removed from that office without delay and be not employed again in any diplomatic or foreign mission without our further orders.' 228. In the same despatch the Hon'ble Court stated that at the recommendation of the Bight Hon'ble the Governor-General of India they had come to the resolution of immediately consolidating the Bagdad and Bussorah Residencies; that the ' Bagdad Residency should be withdrawn, and that whatever communication of a political nature it might be necessary in future to have with the Pacha of Bagdad should be made through the medium of the Resident at Bussorah as formerly, or by his Assistant deputed to Bagdad for that purpose.' The Hon'ble Court in the same despatch directed that Mr. Rich, the Resident at Bagdad, should, now that they had ordered the aboli tion of that Residency, be appointed to succeed Mr. Manesty as Resident at Bussorah. 229. The above orders were on the 2nd March 1810 communicated by this Government to Mr. Manesty and Mr. Rich. Mr. Manesty was directed, on his being relieved by Mr. Rich or by Dr. Hine, Surgeon and Assistant to the Bagdad Residency, or by Dr. Colquhoun, Surgeon and Assistant to the Bussorah Residency, to ' consider himself divested of the office of Resident at Bussorah.' Mr. Rich was at the same time directed either to proceed himself to Bussorah with the least practicable delay and receive charge of that Residency from Mr. Manesty, or to send either of the gentlemen above mentioned to Bussorah forthwith for that purpose. Mr. Governor Duncan on the same day (2nd March 1810) addressed the following letter to the Pacha of Bagdad, informing him of these arrangements :— ' It having been provided by the Hon'ble Company, with the view to the promo tion of greater ease and uniformity in the discharge of the duties and functions of the hitherto distinct liosidencies at iour Highness' Court and at Bussorah, that after the respectable Mr. Manesty the permanent charge of both should devolve on, and be exercised by, the respectable Mr. Claudius .James Rich, in whom the greatest con fidence is reposed for the able execution of so important a trust, I have the honor now to inform Your Highness that this projected junction of the two stations, and their being hereafter blended in one, will immediatel\ take place, and I have to express my reliance that ) our Highness will be pleased, on this addition of responsibility, as vested in Mr. Rich, to extend towards this gentleman (who has, I am sure, entirely at heart the cultivation of the most perfect harmony on his part) a proportionate increase of Your Highness' beneficial countenance and favorable support for the purpose of enabling him to acquit himself to the satisfaction of the Government of India and to his employers at home of the weighty trust thus reposed in him.'WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 105 230. On the 2nd June 1810 Mr. Rich, in reply to the above orders, stated that from ' motives connected with the good of the service' he had resolved to continue for the present to reside at Bag-dad, and that he had therefore directed Dr. Colquhoun, the Surgeon and Assistant to the Resident at Bussorah, to receive charge of that Residency from Mr. Manesty. A few days, however, previous to Mr. Rich having issued this order to Dr. Colquhoun, that gentleman had been sent by Mr. Manesty to Bagdad in charge of despatches to the Resident at that place. Dr. Colquhoun returned to Bussorah on the 12th June (1810), and on the same day received charge of that Residency from Mr. Manesty. In reporting his having made over charge of the Bussorah Residency to Dr. Colquhoun, Mr. Manesty stated that it was his inten tion to remain at Bussorah, on account of his private affair, until the 1st September following, on which date he would proceed to England vid Constantinople, without, however, resigning the service. In reply, Mr. Manesty was informed that Government ' could not permit hiin to proceed to England without his conforming to the estab lished regulations and orders of the Hon'ble Court, which required a resignation of the service in this country, to which however it would be recommended to the Court that he might be allowed to return should he solicit it.' In reply, Mr. Manesty, on the 23rd September 1810— 'tendered his formal and decided resignation of the Hon'ble Company's service,' having, as he stated, ' determined to accept the offer of an annuity which had been made to him by the Committee of Management of the Bombay Civil Fund.' In conformity with this resolution, Mr. Manesty stated that he intended shortly to proceed to Bagdad, where after a short stay he would proceed on to Constantinople, and finally to England. In reply, Mr. Manesty was prohibited from proceeding further than Constantinople, until he had furnished Government with certain documents, for which Government had several times called, connected with his accounts, and had satisfied all public demands against him. 231. In a letter dated the 29th July 1810 Dr. Colquhoun reported that Selim Aga, the Mussaleem of Bussorah, who had received an intima tion that he was about to be removed from that office by the Pacha, had for some time past projected the design of revolutionizing the Pachalic, w T ith the view of deposing the Pacha and raising himself to that dignity. On endeavouring, however, to carry this design into execution, he was surprised by the sudden hostile appearance at Bussorah on the 10th July of a large body of Montifick Arabs, from whom he had expected co-oper ation, who on the 14th of the same month entered and took possession of the town without bloodshed. Selim Aga immediately fled, but sub sequently the Montifick Arabs permitted him to retire with his family and property to Bushire, where, he stated, he was desirous of spending the remainder of his life. On the 31st of the same month (July 1810) Ahmed Beg,* who has been appointed by the Pacha Mussaleem of Bussorah in succession to Selim Aga, arrived at and entered that town without any opposition from the Montificks, and assumed charge of the Government. * Ahmed Beg was deposed by the Pacha of Bagdad on the 1st January following, and was succeeded by Ibrahim Aga, who was appointed by the Pacha to succeed to the office of Mussaleem.10G PRECIS OF INFORMATION BEGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 232. On the 5tli October 1810 an attack was made by the Courds— at the instigation of the Ottoman Porte, who had issued an order for the deposition of the Pacha of Bag-dad, but to which order he had refused to submit—upon the army of the Pacha, which terminated in his defeat and death on the same day. The following account was given of these occurrences in a narrative forwarded by Mr. Rich to this Government on the 9th October 1810 ;— ' On the 5th October, in the morning, the Pacha encamped at some little distance from the town with all the troops he could collect ; about the hour of afternoon prayer, 2 p. m., the Reis Effendi advanced, and the action commenced by the Courds charging the Pacha's army ; they were, however, completely broken by the Pacha's artillery ; but this advantage was not followed up: the carriages of the guns were found to be old and unserviceable, and they were soon dismounted by their own fire. The Courds rallied ; they were greatly superior in numbers to the Turks, and the Pacha's army was weak ened and dispirited by the desertion of a large body of Courds who were on his side, and of whom great hopes had been entertained. The Pacha, however, behaved with the utmost intrepidity, and the action continued till after dark, but the Turks were completely wearied and disheartened, and in the morning when the Pacha perceived that the desertion of his followers had almost left him alone, nothing remained for him but to fly with a few faithful Georgians. They took the road to Eussorah and reached the Diala in safety, the bridge of which he broke after passing it. A strong party of Dafayhs or Shummers soon afterwards fell upon him, overpowered his followers, and cut off his head, which they carried to the lleis Effendi, who immedi ately forwarded it to Constantinople. ' Thus terminated, at the age of twenty-four, the life and reign of Solyman Pacha, a man of warm affection and actual good principles. His faults were such as pro ceed f) om extreme youth, and would have been corrected by age and experience. Since his reconciliation with me he has ever been the strongest and most sincere friend of the British, and I fear it will be long ere the Residency is so well situated. ' The result of this affair and the present state of the Pachalic fully justify my endeavours to prevent its taking this turn. The country is at present in the worst possi ble state, and presents only one scene of confusion from Mardin to Bussorah ; it is not known who will succeed to the Yizierat, but greatly fear they will set up some person of no weight or character, who will be entirely subservient to the wishes and inclina tions of the Courds, by whose means the conquest of Bagdad was effected, an arrange ment which cannot but be prejudicial to our interests and respectability in this most interesting part of Western Asia.' The Ottoman Government appointed* Abdoolla Pacha of Bagdad, in succession to the deceased ' Solyman.' The new Pacha addressed a letter to this Government (without date), intimating his having been raised to that dignity by the Sultan, and stating it to be his earnest desire that the most friendly relations should exist between himself and the British Government. This letter was replied to in a communication from Mr. Governor Duncan on the 20th March 1811 congratulating the new Pacha on his accession to that dignity. 233. In a letter dated the 2nd June 1812 Mr. Rich stated that the Pacha of Bagdad had received a firman from the Sultan directing the deposal of the ' Courdish rebel, Abdurrahman Pacha,' in consequence of his having by his intrigues with the Persians rendered himself entirely independent of his immediate superior the Pacha of Bagdad, and that His Excellency had accordingly marched with a force towards Courdistan., In a further letter, dated the 24th of the same month, Mr. Rich stated * The precise date of this appointment cannot be ascertained, but it must have been made some time in December 1810.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 107 that the Pacha (of Bagdad) had on the 18th of the same month obtained a most signal and unexpected victory over Abdurrahman Pacha, the effect of which would, he entertained no doubt, lead to the entire sub jection of ' the Courdistan' to the Pacha of Bagdad, by which that Pachalic would acquire a strength and respectability it had not possessed for the last ten years, and would in reality become the most powerful territory under the Porte. 234. On the 5th June 1812 Mr. Rich reported that he had lately obtained from the Pacha two decrees in favor of the British Govern ment, namely, one for preventing the desertion at Bussorah of sailors from the Hon'ble Company^ cruizers and other vessels, and the other for preventing the sale at Bussorah of any natives of India as slaves : both of these decrees were addressed to the Mussaleem of Bussorah, and the first of them was to the following effect:— ' It is declared that the sailors and those who work on hoard the cruizers and merchant ships of the British Government some times by drunkenness or other offences incur the displeasure of their Captains and become liable to just and necessary punish ment and correction, and moreover, be it known that should the sailors or workmen aforesaid, in order to escape such chastisement, take refuge with, and expect protection from, either yourself or the head Captain of Shat-el-Arab (vulgarly), called the Captain Pacha, you shall by no means afford them protection, but deliver them up to the Agent at Bussorah of the esteemed Resident of the British Government at Bagdad' in which intention this order has been written, decreed, and transmitted. When this shall reach you, by the power of the Most High you will immediately regulate your conduct and act by the decree contained in it.' 235. The second decree was as follows :— ' It is declared that in consideration of the amicable relations subsisting between the Sublime Government, of perpetual strength and internal stability {i.e., the Porte), and the British Government, whose friendship it behoves us to cultivate, should the Captain or crew of ships trading on the seas, whether belonging toBussorah or Muscat, steal and bring subjects of the aforesaid Government in India, either males or females, natives of India, for sale at Bussorah in the manner of negro, male and female, slaves, and the Agent of the esteemed Resident at Bagdad for the British Government established at Bussorah prove that the aforesaid male and female slaves are not negroes but natives of India, who have been kidnapped, they shall be taken from the hands of the thieves and despoilers and delivered up into his hands. And for carefully establishing this clear law in the Government this order is written, decreed, and transmitted with the power of the Most High. When this shall reach you, you will immediately regulate your actions and conduct by the articles contained in it.' 236. In a despatch to this Government, dated the 23rd September 1812, the Ilon'ble the Court of Directors authorized, in conformitv with a recommendation made by the Government of India, the official designation of the ' Resident at Bussorah' being changed to that of ' Political Agent in Turkish Arabia/' with the liberty to reside either at Bussorah or Bagdad as occasion might require, and with authority to depute his Assistant to either of those places. 237. In January 1813 Abdoolla, the Pacha of Bagdad, proceeded towards Bussorah with a force against the Montifick Chief, who was encamped with an army of nine or ten thousand men at a short distance from that town. On the two ai'mies, however, arriving within sight of each other (during the first week in February) Abdoolla Pacha's troops threw down their arms and went over to the side of the Montifick Chief. Abdoolla Pacha under assurances of personal protection surren dered himself to the Montificks, but was a few days afterwards put to108 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. death. On this intelligence reaching Bagdad, the Cadi proclaimed 'Saeed Beg (then in his 21st year) Pacha of Bagdad, pending the pleasure of the Sultan. Saeed Beg made a public entry into Bagdad on the 16th March 1818, acccompanied by the Montifick Chief, and assumed charge of the Government of the Pachalic. On the 30th June following a messenger arrived at Bagdad from Constantinople with the confirmation of the Sultan to the appointment of Saeed Beg as Pacha of Bagdad. 238. On the 23rd June 1813 a body of Arabs entered the town of Bussorah by surprize and proceeded to the Turkish Government House, which they plundered, and beat the Mussaleem. A general insurrection ensued, but finally the Mussaleem was enabled to gather a sufficient force to expel the Arabs and to restore tranquillity. 239. Between June 1813 and December 1816 frequent disturb ances occurred both at Bagdad and Bussorah, and finally, on the 4th November 1816, an order reached Bagdad from the Sultan for the immediate deposal of Saeed Pacha, and for ' Daood Effendi' being proclaimed Pacha in his stead. On this order reaching Bagdad, Daood (the Pacha elect) addressed the following letter to Mr. Rich, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia:— 'Most honored and sincere friend,—Relying on the friendship which has always subsisted between us, and being desirous of receiving accounts of your well doing, I write to communicate you the intelligence that my gracious Sovereign has been pleased to confer upon me the Vizierat with the Government of Bagdad, Bussorah, and Sheherooz, and that the Imperial firmans with the insignia of the Vizierat arrived here on Sunday, the 4th instant, in charge of Mahomed Aga, late Kiahya to His Excellency Mahomed Saeed Halet Effendi, Ex-Minister of Conferences. After reading the sublime firmans I returned my humble thanks to the Almighty for elevating me to so high a dignity. I hasten to announce you this joyful event that I might both gratify your friendship towards me and inform myself of the state of your health and recall myself to your remembrance.' 240. Saeed Pacha, however, refused to resign the Government to Daood Ellendi, who accordingly approached Bagdad with a large force, which, on the 7th January 1817, was attacked by Saeed Pacha's army and put to flight. Shortly afterwards a defection took place in a portion of Saeed Pacha's army, which was followed by a general insurrection at Bagdad, in which the Mamelukes took a conspicuous part. On the 21st February Daood Effendi, who had re-collected his scattered army, entered Bagdad, when the whole city submitted to his authority, and on the following day he was proclaimed Pacha. On the 24th of the same month Saeed, the Ex-Pacha, who, on Daood Effendi's approach had taken shelter in the citadel of Bagdad, was ' under an order determined on in secret Council' put to death by being beheaded. On Daood Effendi establish ing himself as Pacha, Mr. Rich addressed him a letter of congratulation to the following effect:— ' I now avail myself of the first moment, in which it has been possible and proper for me to write to Your Highness, to congratulate Your Highness on the accession to the high dignity of Pacha of Bagdad, Bussorah, and Shehezour, which I sincerely hope you may long enjoy with all health and prosperity. I make no doubt but the amicable relations which have always subsisted between the British Government and the former Wullees of Bagdad will not only be maintained but even increased under the administra tion of Your Highness, and I shall lose no time in informing my Government of Your Highness' accession, in which event I rejoice, not only as the representative of the British Government, but as a person between whom and Your Highness sentimentsWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 109 of private and sincere friendship have always subsisted. I take the opportunity of sending this letter of friendship and congratulation by Your Highness' servant and well-wisher, Dervish Aga, who is sincerely attached to Your Highness. I have lately endeavoured to show him some friendly attention, at which I hope Your Highness will be satisfied, and should Your Highness enquire after me and my proceedings, I have requested Dervish Aga to give you a full account.' 241. On the 9th March 1817 Daood Pacha addressed a letter to the Right Hon'ble Sir Evan Nepean, then Governor of Bombay, inti mating his having been raised by the Sublime Porte to the dignity of ' Pacha of Bagdad, Bussorah, and Conrdistan,' and giving an account of the opposition he had encountered, on his approaching Bagdad, from the army of the deceased, Saeed Pacha. This letter concluded with assurances of friendship towards the British Government, and an expression of the writer's hope that the perfect good understanding then subsisting between Great Britian and the Ottoman Porte would ever remain unim paired. In reply, Sir Evan Nepean addressed a letter to Daood Pacha, offering his cordial congratulations to His Highness on his being raised to the high and dignified situation of Pacha, and expressing the sincere desire of the British Government to improve the friendly relations so happily existing between the two Governments. 242. On the 17th September 1818 Captain (now Brevet Colonel Taylor) R. Taylor, of the 3rd Regiment, Bombay Native Infantry, was appointed by this Government Assistant to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia in succession to Mr. Colquhoun, who had applied for permission to proceed to England for the benefit of his health. Captain Taylor arrived at Bussorah on the 15th March 1819, and on the same day, as Assistant to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, received charge from Mr. Colquhoun of the subordinate Residency at Bussorah. 243. In a letter dated the 28th January 1819 Mr. Rich reported that ' Mons. De Pigouroux,' the French Consul at Bagdad, who had never previously visited the Pacha, had lately applied to be admitted to an audience to His Highness, and at the same time had intimated to the Pacha that in receiving his visit His Highness ought to bear in mind that— ' throughout the Ottoman Empire it was ordained by existing treaties that any French Agent was to be ranked above all British representatives whatever.' With reference to this intimation the Pacha remarked to his Minis ters that— ' there must be some gross misrepresentations in this statement, that it was impossible that a nation like the British should consent to acknowledge the superiority of a rival power; but that even allowing so Improbable a supposition, it could only hold good in the case of two representatives of equal rank, and that Mr. Kich being a Resident Minis ter and Mons. De Pigouroux only a Consul there could not, under any circumstances, be a competition between them.' The Pacha then added— ' Whatever may be the rule elsewhere, the ceremonial of my Court gives the precedence to the British Resident. Mr. Rich has not chosen to insist on his own rank, but it is my duty to preserve it for him ; and since the French Consul has been pleased to agitate the question and create disturbance about his precedence, if he chooses to come to the palace, he shall be assigned the place formerly occupied by French Consuls before the establishment of the British Residency. From Mr. Rich's moderation I should not have felt inclined to investigate narrowly into such minutice, but hence forward the Consul shall only be allowed what he is strictly entitled to. So much I110 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. consider as my duty to the Bey's (Mr. Rich's) own person; such are my sentiments for him, that I cannot do him too much honor. I consider him as a member of my own family, and would not show even an Ambassador Extraordinary attention which he had not received.' 244. In a letter dated the 5th July 1819 Mr. Rich gave the following character of the Pacha, and information in regard to the then condition of Turkish Arabia :— ' The affairs of this Government are I am sorry to report, rapidly falling into a state of confusion, partly no doubt from the unavoidable pressure of circumstances, but princi pally from the imprudence and want of integrity of the Pacha and his Minister. The times are certainly replete with difficulties, but His Highness, instead of exerting his own powers and meeting them with steady and well combined measures, although conscious of being surrounded by servants who are neither able nor honest, gives up his own judgment to any one who will save him the trouble of thinking, satisfies himself with temporary expedients, shuts his eyes to the exactions and violence of his Mame lukes, and seems solely intent on the hasty acquisition of money by any means. It will readily be conceived that the evil consequences of such conduct will equally affect both the internal and external relations of the (Government. The domestic state of this country is in an equally bad condition with its foreign politics. In the city all business is at a stand. The Police is almost null and void but the evil disposed feel confidence. In the country the exactions and tyrannies exercised by the subordinate officers of Government on the peasantry and inoffensive pastoral tribes are without a parallel even in the annals of this wretched Government. The outlaw, Saeed Saleh, at the head of a desperate gang of ruffians ravages the district of Mendeli. The Mardin desert has become impassable, except by an army, from the incursions of the mountaineers of Sinjar, who infest it in parties of several hundreds, and have entirely cut off more than one caravan. Among the severe losses sustained by the merchants from these depredations, I have to regret that of a Tartar, who was plundered of despatches he was bringing to the Residency from the Hon'ble Company's Agent at Constanti nople. I have taken all the measures necessary on this occasion to procure the recovery of the papers, should they not have been destroyed by the banditti, of which I fear there is but small chance.' 245. In a letter dated the 12th August 1820, Captain Taylor, Assistant in charge of the Residency at Bussorah, reported that on the 16th of the preceding month a party of Najedah Arabs had entered that town and attempted to gain possession of the serai, but had failed in consequence of the defence made by the Mussaleem. The Arabs being baffled in this attempt, then murdered a number of the inhabitants, and plundered the town of Bussorah, and encountering on their retreat a small party of Beloochees advancing to the relief of the serai, they seized and put to death Iskandar Aga, the Commander, and two of his relations. The reason assigned by the assistants for this attack was a previous affray between some of their party and the Mussaleem's guard, in which the former alleged that two of their clan had been killed. Captain Taylor, however, stated that this attack had been instigated by some of the principal Najedah merchants, who were dissatisfied with a recent order of the Bagdad Government in a case respecting the restitu tion of some landed property, and that they thought that this order might be averted by this display of their strength and influence. On receipt of this information Captain Taylor was directed by this Govern ment to observe the strictest neutrality in these differences between the Najedah Arab and the Turks, and not to comply with the demand which had been preferred to him by the Mussaleem for the surrender of certain property belonging to some of the Najedah merchants then on board some British vessels laying in the Bussorah River. Captain Taylor was further directed not to extend his protection to the Agents of any BritishWITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. Ill merchants at Bussorah, nor to any other individuals who were not subjects of the British Government, or expressly provided for as belonging- to the Hon'ble East India Company's Factory. This officer was, however, directed in all cases to use his good offices with either party to prevent those who had a claim on British protection from suffering injustice, and in the event of these disputes approaching to a crisis threatening the security of the Hon'ble Company's Factory, or exposing it to insult, he was authorized to adopt measures for withdrawing with the public property either to Bushire or to the island of Kishm. These instruc tions were entirely approved by the Government of India in a letter from Mr. Secretary Livinton, dated the 25th November 1820. 246. In a further letter, dated the 21st November 1820, Captain 1 ay lor reported that he had received an intimation from the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia that he had reason to believe that a violent attempt would shortly be made at Bagdad to invade British rights and seize the property of individuals under its protection. In his communi cation to Captain Taylor, Mr. Rich directed him, in the probable event of his shortly receiving a letter from a Mr. Scooboda, a European merchant, who was residing at Bagdad under British protection, containing informa tionthat his property had been seized at the Custom House,' imme diately to strike the British flag and to cause all communication to cease between the Residency establishment and the Bussorah Government and its subjects. Captain Taylor was at the same time directed by Mr. Rich to intimate to the Mussaleem in writing that he was acting in con formity with instructions received from the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, and that the intercourse would not be re-established until he received advices from Mr. Rich of complete satisfaction having been obtained for recent outrages. Mr. Rich directed that the cessation of communication with the Bussorah Government should extend in the strictest sense to all ships under British colours, whether belonging to the English or natives, and that no goods should be permitted to be landed from such vessels, nor any intercourse whatever take place with Turkish subjects. 247. Captain Taylor having shortly afterwards received a com munication from Mr. Scooboda to the effect anticipated by Mr. Rich, he carried the above orders into effect, and withdrew with his establishment to Mohammarah, a small town in a secure situation on the left or Chaab bank of the Euphrates. 248. In a letter to the address of Government dated the 28th November 1820, Mr. Rich stated that for a long time past the Pacha had evinced the most unfriendly conduct towards him, but that at the date of his letter 'matters had arrived at such a state that it had become impossible for him to clear a single bale ot goods, or recover the smallest outstanding claim for any British subject without a violent quarrel, and that at last His Highness had countenanced a public declaration by his Ministers that no European rights were recognized at Bagdad. The Pacha followed this declaration by the seizure of Mr. Scooboda's property, with an intimation that henceforth he had resolved to compel the payment of double duties upon all European goods entering the Pachalic.112 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. 249. Mr. Rich remonstrated against this exaction, but without success, his remonstrances being- treated with marked indignity by the Pacha, under whose orders double duties commenced to be exacted on all British goods passing through the Pachalic. As the Pacha continued to treat Mr. Rich with disrespect and refused to withdraw the obnoxious order, he informed His Highness that he had resolved to leave the Pacha lic and proceed to India. The Pacha, however, declared that Mr. Rich 'should not leave Bagdad;' and on the 25th March 1821 Mr. Rich received a private intimation that the Pacha intended to send a body of troops down to the Residency during the day and make him a pri soner. Mr. Rich accordingly lost no time in placing the Residency in the best possible state of defence in his power. The following extract from Mr. Rich's report, dated the 29th March 1821, contains an account of his proceedings in the successful defence of the Residency, and of his subsequent negotiations with the Pacha:— ' First, I requested the opinions of the gentlemen living in the Residency, viz., Mr. Boll, my own Assistant, Captain John Elliot,* now of Her Majesty's 21st Dragoons, Mr. Taylor,* of the Madras Cavalry, and Mr. Hoste,* Assistant Surgeon of Her Majesty's 17th Infantry, to all of whom I am most particularly indebted for their prompt and spirited conduct; and with their unanimous concurrence and cordial assistance I pro ceeded without loss of time to put the house in a state of defence. The guard on this occasion behaved with the usual steadiness and zeal of Bombay sepoys, but what really astonished me was the attachment exhibited by the Turkish attendants; they were armed in an instant, it was vain that I solicited, that I commanded them to retire, while it was yet time, and not to risk their lives and families in a quarrel which did not concern them. They would listen to nothing, they crowded around me, they embraced me and declared with one voice that they regarded neither their lives nor families, and they were determined to die on the spot where I should fall, even some who were but remotely connected with the Residency, or had but recently' entered the service, came forward on this occasion and insisted on shutting themselves up with us. To the hour of my death the remembrance of the affection shown me on that memor able day shall not be effaced from my heart. Our band was small but resolute, and whatever might have been the ultimate result, the Turks would certainly not have obtained a cheap victory. Captain Elliot took command of the guard, and' caused the yatch to be drawn up under the windows to prevent her being taken possession of by the Turks. Mr. Taylor and the other gentlemen charged themselves with different divisions of the house, we mustered, including the guard, nearly a hundred musquets. The Residency was indeed well covered by the narrow streets by which only it is approachable on the town side, but it might be battered from the opposite side of the river. However, some time must elapse before an efficient battery could be formed in that situation, and in the meantime knowing the general attachment of the town to our cause, I hoped that if we repulsed a few assaults, some diversions might take place in our favor, a hope which, it will be seen, was not ill-founded. ' w e had scarcely put ourselves in a state of defence, when the hostile demon strations on the part of the Pasha began, detachments of troops were marched to the different gates of the city to prevent our escape, the Kiahya Beg in person took up his station on the river just outside the southern gate ; a detachment of the Dromedary Corps was ordered to march still lower down the river ; a gun belonging to the local artillery was sent on the opposite side, I believe principally with a view to overawe that quarter of the city which is of a turbulent character, as it was not brought down opposite the Residency ; other detachments occupied different posts surrounding the Residency, and at length it was announced to me that a Corps of Beratalis or Regular Infantry were advancing against the house, and had reached the top of the street leading to our door. 1 now concluded the attack would take place in a few minutes and I gave orders that our people should continue strictly on the defensive and avoid * Gentlemen who were staying at the time at Bagdad.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 113 beginning the contest, but as soon as the Beratalis saw our preparations they fell back, and hied off by another avenue, taking up their station at a coffee-house close by. All the bazars were immediately shut. ' 'J-kiHgs continued in this state for a quarter of an hour after the advance of the .Beratalis. At last the Malarajee Bashi, or Commandant of the Pacha's infantry guard (an old friend of mine, whose life I had on a former occasion saved), accom panied by the second officer of the Choadars, advanced alone and applied for admission in a respectful manner. The latter offered to be the bearer of any thing I might have to say to the Pasha, the former came to sit with me in the mean time, and found means secretly to assure me that he would use his best influence to prevent the corps he commanded from firing a single shot against the house which had saved his life. I immediately wrote a note in Turkish to the Pacha, informing him of the conduct of the Mohindar, and complaining of the outrage Of this note I had no opportunity of taking a copy, but it merely contained what 1 have above stated. ' After the lapse of some time Jowseraff Bashi (the principal leader of the cabal) accompanied by the Dufterdar Effendi (an old and intimate friend of mine) and Hajee Emin, the merchant formerly spoken of, arrived on the part of the Pacha to propose terms. I would, however, listen to nothing while the troops were under arms, and after much soli- citation on their part and assistance on mine, with the detail of which it would be useless to trouble you, all they could obtain from me was a promise that I would not leave Bagdiid during the night, and which I gave because as I told them nothing was further from my intentions; they wanted to extort a promise that I would not attempt to leave the town till the affair was finished, but this I of course refused. All this dissension was carried on with a show of great politeness on the part of the Govern ment, with abundance of frivolous, excuse and unsatisfactory assurances. Some delay still occurred before the troops were drawn off, the night was far advancing, and 1 positively refused to utter a word more while a single Turk remained in the neighbourhood. At last a Turkish officer came to report to me that all the troops were withdrawn from the quarter of the Residency, we remained notwithstanding under arms all night for fear of a surprise; they were in the same state in the iralaee, and detachments still remained in some distant quarters of the city, as the 1 acha was given to understand that some Parishes had shown a disposition to rise in our favor. The Commandant of a Corps of Imperial Turkish artillery, just arrived from Constantinople to serve against the Persians, expressly told the Pacha that unless ne produced an order from the Sultan he would not suffer one of the Imperial Corps under his command to act against the representative of a power at peace with their common master, and I have since been informed that a great many armed Arabs on the opposite side of the river were only waiting for the signal of a shot or two from the liesidency to rise en masse and create a diversion in our favor. I am, however, happy that matters were not carried to such an extremity, and that a contest was not entered into, which must have caused a dreadful massacre, and the termination of which was uncertain from want of an ostensible Chief to head the rising in the town and overawe the Pacha's party in the Palace.' 250. Mr. Rich concluded his letter by describing the situation of himself and his establishment at the date of his letter. The following- is an extract from this portion of his report:— I and the whole establishment here are literally prisoners. No objection have •n 1 r ' la ^p. ^ ti 1 . 6 departure of the gentlemen* who have been my guest, and who w ui set off immediately. It has been distinctly intimated to me from the Pacha that 1 am not to be allowed to quit Bagdad. He sees that he has in the violence of a moment gone so far that he must go further and I am to be the sufferer - ; the period of my captivity has not been defined, but I am aware that I am to be considered in the light of a hostage. This detention, from which I see no prospect of a liberation durin' - the summer, is in itself prejudicial to my affairs and dangerous to my health, which is in a \ ery precarious state ; but for what further sufferings I may be reserved, and to what it may be his wish to compel me, I cannot conjecture. I might indeed easily escape, but I will never abandon those who stood by me in the hour of peril as long * The three officers above alluded to. P114 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E.

COMPY. as there is the least chance that my presence may he a protection or even a comfort to them, and I will accept of no plan of liberation which will not provide equally for the safety of the numerous dependants, who have rendered themselves obnoxious to the Pacha by their connection with the Residency. I rely on Government for relief or revenge.' 251. On receipt of the above intellig-enee, the Hon^ble Mr. Elphin- stone, then Governor of this Presidency, addressed the following letter, dated the 12th May 1821, to the Pacha of Bagdad:— 'I have heard with the greatest surprize of the obstruction offered by Your Highness to the departure of the British Resident from Bagdad, such a measure towards a public minister would have been inconsistent with the practice of all civi lized nations even after a declaration of war, and in a state of friendship such as now subsists between His Majesty the King of Great Britain and the Sublime Porte, the outrage is altogether without example. ' The good understanding which the British Govei*nment in India has always been anxious to cultivate with Your Highness would rather have led it to expect a continuance of attention and hospitality from you towards its Agent. After the pitch to which things have come, it is needless to recur to the original ground of dispute ; but I must observe that on your increasing the established duty on goods imported by British merchants, the British (iovernment was certainly at full liberty to continue or leave off the trade with your Government, as it thought was best for the interests of its subjects. On the other hand, if Your Highness had any reason to complain of any part of the demands of Mr. Rich, you could at any time have obtained redress by applying to this Government or to the supreme Government in Bengal. ' It is not, however, my intention to go into any further discussion of that ques tion now, nor indeed will it be in my power to carry on any negotiation with Your Highness, until I am convinced that the obstructions to the departure of the British Resident have been entirely removed. I have therefore addressed positive instructions to Mr. Rich to leave Bagdad without delay ; and I rely on Your Highness' affording every facility to that gentleman in carrying the orders of his Government into effect. When I shall receive accounts of the arrival of Mr. Rich with his suite and all the persons under the protection of the British Residency at such place as he may fix on beyond the Pachalic of Bagdad, I shall be prepared to point out the steps which I think necessary for restoring the friendship that has hitherto so happily subsisted between Your Highness and the British Government in India. ) ' If, contrary to Your Highness' usual wisdom, you should be led by desperate counsellers to prevent the departure of the British Resident, his suite and dependents, from Bagdad, 1 beg to apprize Your Highness that I shall henceforth consider him as a prisoner in your hands; and that the power which he has hitherto exercised will be transferred to another officer beyond the limits of the Pachalic, to whom instruc tions to that effect have been sent, the British Government will then look to the justice of the Sublime Porte and to its friendship for His Britannic Majesty for justice and redress, in the meantime adopting such local measures to assert its character as the crisis may seem to require. I doubt not that Your Highness' wisdom will lead you to foresee the consequences of a line of conduct equally inconsistent with hospitality and good faith, and one which must render impossible any further communication between Your Highness and every independent State. I confidently rely on a return of the friendly disposition that has hitherto guided you, and I trust that the present unplea sant dissensions may speedily terminate in a manner consistent with the alliance which has subsisted between the Great Monarchs, our respective Sovereigns, a.nd with the special friendship which has existed between Your Highness and the British Govern ment in India. ' 252. A letter was on the same day (12th May 1821) also addressed by the Hon'ble Mr. Elphinstone to the Right Hon'ble Viscount Strang- ford, His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, informing Ilis Lord ship of the Pacha's proceedings, and suggesting that His Lordship should demand from the Sultan the immediate release of Mr. Rich, and full and public reparation for the insult which the Pacha had offered toWITH TURKISH ARABIA— 1646 TO 1846. 115 the British nation in the person of its representative at his Court. The following 1 is an extract from Mr. Elphinstone's letter :— 'I have no doubt Your Lordship will be struck with the necessity of exacting full and public reparation for the insult offered by the Pacha to the British nation; the first object, however, must at present be to procure the liberation of Mr. Rich from the dangerous situation in which he is placed. I would venture to suggest that the demands for Mr. Rich's release should be supported by the most peremptory orders from the Porte. When that is effected the Pacha's explanations might be listened to, and his apologies received, if sufficiently public and sufficiently indicative of contrition, and if attended with the punishment of the Pacha's instigators ; all new imposts on our trade should also. Your Lordship will probably think, be done away at the same time : and if these terms be not complied with by the Pacha, I should conceive his removal or more severe punishment might be justly insisted on. ' I take this occasion to observe that the utility of the Residency at Bagdad first instituted when the French were in Egypt has long been doubtful; that it was the intention of this Government to have removed it if these disputes had not arisen ; and that it will be removed as soon as they are closed, but it will still be of the utmost importance to maintain our character at Bagdad, and our influence both in Persia and Arabia will in a great measure depend on the notice that is taken of the present insult on our representative.' 253. In a letter dated the 25th May 1821 Mr. Rich reported the release from Bagdad, and safe arrival at Bussorah on the 19th of the same month, of himself and the whole of his establishment. This object was effected by Mr. Rich under the circumstances stated in the following extract from his letter :— ' While I was in Coordistan last year a report was prevalent in Bagdad, derived from I know not what source, that I had been nominated to the Government of Surat. This report was revived again at Bagdad after the late dispute, and, as it pretty generally obtained credit, I conceived the idea of availing myself of it to attempt the liberation of the establishment, which was the easier, as it is never the custom of the Turks to make any direct questions regarding another person's affairs. When the subject was pointed to me I contented myself with observing that, although I knew nothing of Surat or any other particular place, there was every reason to believe I had been nominated to a post in India; that I should long ago have visited that country had it not been for the late unpleasant dissension, and that my remaining at Bagdad was an injury to myself and inconvenience to Government. Many were the persons instructed to sound me, but without appearing at all aware of their object. My con versations were always of the said tenor, and managed with every appearance of carelessness and absence of design, so that the whole of the adverse party, comparing what they now gathered from me with what they had formerly heard when I was not in Bagdad, began thoroughly to believe that I had long ago been recalled without any reference to the late dispute. I had also many able and intelligent friends who co -operated with me, and what is very remarkable, their assistance was afforded without anv directions from, or even understanding with, me; while they affected even in conver sation with me to believe the current report, they seemed to comprehend at the same time that it was desirable to give it general currency and to use every endeavour to tranquillize the Pacha's mind. They were influenced in this both by personal attachment to myself and a strong hope that I should ultimately be the instrument of defeating and humbling a person so generally feared and detested as the Pacha Khoja Ezra from other motives connected with his own designs wished for my absence, and this was a very important point, as the slightest exertion on his part would have turned the whole affair. ' When I found that the Pacha had been properly prepared, I came forward suddenly, stated my intention of leaving Bagdad immediately on some private urgent business which required my presence before the commencement of the heats, lliis step was attended with all the success I had hoped, 'ihe Pacha seemed taken by surprise, and after a slight hesitation gave his consent; at the same time so thoroughly possessed was he by the report that had been in circulation that he said ' as you are ^oing down to India I will take the opportunity of writing to the Governor of Bombay.116 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. It may be imagined that I did not contradict him, and a few days afterwards he sent the enclosed letter to your address. ' The time which now elapsed before my departure from Bagdad was a most anxious and difficult period. I could indeed myself at any time have escaped from Bagdad, but my object was both to avoid doing anything which might have the appearance of flight, and to secure all the dependants of the Residency. These objects 1 happily accomplished. I have brought off every one belonging to the Residency who was in any danger, and we left Bagdad with the greatest^ Mat and t'ollowed by the regrets and good wishes of almost the whole of the inhabitants. We arrived here on the 19th instant.' 254. The letter from the Pacha of Bagdad to the address of the Hon'ble Mr. Elphinstone, alluded to in the above extract, was to the following effect:— ' As correspondence builds up the walls of friendship, I take every opportunity of writing to you. This letter is forwarded along with Mr. Rich, Resident at Bagdad, who, agreeably the orders of the English Government, is proceeding to Bombay, having concluded all the business he had at this place. On this^ occasion I cannot find words to express my high opinion of Mr. Rich's talents, magnanimity, and acutoness, and his sincere devotedness to the service of his employers. It has been, and always ill be, my constant endeavour to maintain the terms of amity which exist between the two States. I hope you will continue to favor me with your correspondence.' 255. On the 22nd June 1821 Mr. Rich reported that— ' with a view to allay the suspicions of the Turkish Government, prevent a premature explosion, and afford some chance of keeping British relation with the Pachalic open for a short time longer, as well as to disencumber the factory at Bussorah, and render it easy for Captain Taylor (his Assistant) to quit it at the shortest notice,' he (Mr. Rich) had removed from Bussorah to Bushire, taking with him such of the Native officers of the Bagdad Residency as were peculiarly obnoxous to the Turkish Government on account of their late devotion to British interests. On the 5th October following Mr. Rich was attacked (at Bushire) with cholera, and he died after a few hours' illness. 256. On the 2nd October 1821 the Hon'ble Mr. Elphinstone addressed, with the concurrence of the Government of India, the following letter to the Pacha, informing him of the only conditions on which friendly relations could be restored with his Government:— 'I have delayed a reply to Your Highness'letter* forwarded by Mr. Rich on his departure from Bagdad, until I could make up my mind in respect to the terms on which the relations of amity between the two States could be restored, the termination of which Your Highness has not thought proper to notice in that communication. In my letter of the 12th May I adverted to the cause that led to the differences between Mr. Rich and Your Highness' Government. I demanded his release from the restraint under which he had been placed, and stated that on receiving account ot his arrival with his suite, and all the persons under the protection of the British Residency, at anv place that might be fixed upon beyond the Pachalic of Bagdad, I should be pre pared to point out the conditions on which the friendship that has hitherto so happily subsisted between Your Highness and the British Government in India might be restored. Mr. Rich's departure from Bagdad and arrival at Bushire enables me to ful fill that intention. The extraordinary nature of the offence oflered to the British Government in the person of its representative has been already sufficiently described to render it necessary that I should preface the demands I have to prefer on this occasion by any further explanations, the discrimination of Your Highness will at once satisfy you that on no other terms will it be consistent with our honor to renew the terms of amity with your Government. * Vide paragraph 253.WITH TUHKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 117 &lt; I have then to require from Your Highness, in the first instance, the fullest apology to this (Jovernment and to Mr. Rich for the insult ottered to that gentleman in the attack made on his residence and the restraint imposed upon him. This apoloo-y should be made by the deputation of a respectable person on Your Highness' part to Mr. Rich as well as by letters from Your Highness to that gentleman and to this Government. ' Secondly.—The restoration of the duties to the footing prescribed by the Treaty between our respective Sovereigns. ' Thirdly.—The repayment of the amount of all money levied beyond the rate limited by Treaty. 'Fourthly—The value of all goods injured or destroyed during the disputes between Mr. Scooboda* and Mr. Sturmy.* ' Fifthly. An engagement to treat our diplomatic Agents in future with every mark of respect; and ' Lastly. Protection and attention to English travellers, never demanding cus tom of them, and granting redress to all their just complaints. ' The factory at Bussorah will probably be removed to some other convenient post or at such other place as Mr. Rich may fix. That gentleman will receive the apology demanded, and will conclude with the person deputed the articles for the regulation of our future intercourse which have already been detailed. In the event of an unsatisfac tory answer to these requisitions, I shall be compelled to impose the strictest interdict against all commercial intercourse with the ports under the Pachalic of Bagdad and similar measures will be adopted at the other Presidencies, besides stationino- a sufficient naval force to stop all communications from British ports with that of Bussorah. ' The British Ambassador at the Porte has been made acquainted with the mea- sures to which we shall be compelled to resort by the refusal of Your Highness to comply with these our just demands for the information of the Ottoman Government, and has been solicited to obtain ample justice from the Porte in case it should be with held by Your Highness. ' I trust, however, that Your Highness' own judgment and good sense will suggest to you the propriety of affording a satisfaction so justly demanded, and that^the friendly footing on which vou have heretofore lived with the British Government will be speedily and completely restored.' 257. A copy of the above letter was forwarded to Mr, Rich, with instructions forthwith to remove, pending the compliance of the Pacha with the demands therein contained, the factory at Bussorah to some con venient place in the Persian Gulf, and in the event of the subsequent arrival at such place of a deputation from the Pacha, the Resident was directed to negotiate an agreement for the future intercourse of the two Governments on the terms prescribed in Mr. Elphinstone's letter to the Pacha. On the 4th January 1822 Captain Taylor, on whom, in conse quence of the death of Mr. Rich, the temporary charge of the Residency in Turkish Arabia had devolved, reported, with reference to these instructions, that he had on the 15th of the preceding month struck the British flag at Bussorah, and withdrawn with his establishment and all public property to the Island of Grain, in the Persian Gulf, as being the most eligible spot. 258. On receiving the Hon'ble Mr. Elphinstone's letter, the Pacha deputed an Agent to Captain Taylor, agreeing to the whole of the demands therein contained, with the exception of the ' apology. w Cap tain Taylor deemed it advisable under all circumstances not to enforce this latter demand, and accordingly on the 19th April 1822 he left Grain » Two merchants at Bagdad.118 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E.

C^aptain 'laylor's proceedings were approved by the Government of India. 259. On the 29th March 1823 the Pacha of Bagdad addressed the following- letter to the Hon'ble Mr. Elphinstone in reply to His Excel lency's letter dated the 2nd October 1821, above alluded to, containing His Highness' assent to the whole of the demands therein contained with the exception of the ' apology — ' I have first to make friendly enquiries regarding your health and circumstances, and next to inform you that your welcome letter reached me in a fortunate moment. I have well comprehended its import and the requisitions and demands which it contained. These are :— ' Istly. —That the same duties shall be required of the English as are established throughout the whole of the Ottoman Empire, and prescribed by the Treaty between our respective Sovereigns. ' 2itdly. —The restoration of all money levied over and above the rates mentioned in the said Royal Treaty.

' With respect to the overplus that was taken, and the property destroyed in the affair of Messrs. Scooboda and Sturmy, there appears here to be something inconsistent with the friendship that is established, and to which I cannot consent; I will therefore make enquiry into the matter, and cause restitution to be made as soon as the facts and the amount shall be ascertained. Nor be it concealed from you, that what took place between Mr. Rich and me fell out by Divine command, nor is it fit to charge with blame one who is now no more. Had you sent a confidential person on the part of your Government to examine into the affair, he might have ascertained by personal investigation with whom it originated—it is over, and what is past need not be repeated ; and as I have not shown any backwardness in acceding to the foregoing requisition, so I trust in God there never shall arise cause of blame to me, either for not assisting and supporting in every case all travellers con nected with you, or for not maintaining the dignity and consideration of such as come from you in quality of Agents, or for not yielding ready attention and redress in all matters of complaint from those connected with you, and securing them against oppression and injustice, for this is my duty and practice towards all under my charge, as well as towards all passengers travelling through my territory. Whatever else you may wish done shall be performed in consideration of the friendly relations estab lished between us, and with the stability of which I trust nothing will ever occur to establish.' 260.

To the whole of these demands the Pacha gave his full and unreserved assent in the following letter to Captain Taylor :— ' The dragoman of the English nation has arrived here bearing a sealed despatch from the Government and a letter from yourself containing the following demands:— ' i s t.—A compliance with all stipulations contained in the Imperial Treaties and Eoyal Firmans, ancient or recent.

In a letter from Mr. Swinton, Secretary to the Government of India^ dated the 17th February 1821, this Government was informed, in reply to a reference made on the subject, that the Most Noble the Governor-General in Council had resolved to adopt a suggestion which had recently been made by Mr. Rich, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, that in order to restrain the indiscriminate admission of needy adventurers and others into that country, a prohibition should be issued against British subjects proceeding Irom the ports in India visiting the interior of the Bagdad Pachalic, unless provided with a passport by the Political Secretary at one of the Indian Presidencies granting such per mission. This Government was at the same time furnished with the following notification, which had, on the date of Mr. Secretary Swin- ton's letter, been issued at Calcutta by order of the Most Noble the Governor-General of India in Council. His Excellency the Most Noble the Governor-General in Council deeming it necessary that all British subjects proceeding from this Presidency to any of the ports in the Persian Gulf for the purpose of visiting or passing through the interior of the territories dependent on the Pachalic of Bagdad shall provide themselves with a passport from this Government, notice is hereby given that • application for such passport is to be made to the Secretary to Government in the Political Department, and that any person failing to conform to this notice will be exposed to the hazard of being stopped on his arrival at any of ports aforesaid, and of being prevented from the further prosecution of his journey into the interior. Notifications to the same effect were, at the suggestion of the Government of India, issued by this Government on the 24th April 1821, and also by the Government of Madras. 262. On the 9th May 1822 Captain William Bruce, of the Hon'ble Company's Marine Service, then Resident at Bushire, was informed that, in consequence of the abolition of the Residency at Bagdad,WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 131 Government had appointed him ' Political Agent in the Gulf of Persia/' making- Kishm or Bussorah his head-quarters, and leaving a Native Agent at Bushire. Captain Bruee was, however, informed that this arrangement was not to have effect ' until he had closed all his commercial concerns,' in conformity with a general prohibition which had just been issued by Government, prohibiting all Political Officers of ' all ranks and descrip tions from engaging in trade/' Captain Bruce was at the same time informed that in consideration of his being hereafter debarred from trade, his salary 'as Political Agent in the Persian Gulf' had been fixed at the monthly sum of liupees 1,200. 263. Captain Taylor was at the same time appointed Assistant to the Political Agent in the Persian Gulf on the monthly salary of Rupees 600, under a prohibition of his not engaging in trade, either on his own account or as Agent for others. 264. On the 1st November 1822 Captain Bruce was removed from the situation of Political Agent in the Persian Gulf in consequence of his having entered into unauthorized Treaty with the Prince Regent of Fars. Government took this opportunity, for the reasons explained in the following Minute by the Hon'ble Mr. Elphinstone, dated the 31st October 1822, to disunite, as a temporary measure, the two Agencies in Turkish Aribia and in Persia. In consideration of the removal of our troops from Kishm, and the necessity that will exist for Lieutenant McLeod's directing his whole attention to the conciliation of the Arab tribes, I think that the two Agencies in Turkish Arabia and in Persia should remain distinct and separate from the present. Lieutenant McLeod, of the Bombay Engineers, was under this resolution appointed by this Government Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Captain Taylor was nominated to the appointment of Political Agent at Bussorah on the monthly salary of Rupees 800 with a table allowance of six* hundred rupees per mensem. These proceedings were reported to the Government of India on the 12th November 1822, and were entirely approved by that authority in a letter from Mr. Secretary Swinton dated the 21st February 1823. 265. On the 16th February 1824 Captain Taylor informed this Government that he had lately received a letter from the Pacha, in which His Highness requested that a British medical officer might be deputed from Bombay to Bagdad for the purpose of being permanently located at that place and attending on His Highness, and that he might be furnished with a supply of arms and accoutrements sufficient for a body of 1,000 infantry. Government declined to comply with the former of these requests, on the ground that any benefits likely to result from the residence with the Pacha of a British medical officer would be more than counterbalanced by the embarrassment insepar able from such an arrangement. In regard to the latter of the above requests Captain Taylor was directed to ' inform the Pacha in suitable terms that it was not in the power of Government to comply with his request.' * lliis allowance was increased from the 1st May 182-1 to Rupees 1,000 per mensem.

In September 1824 the Political Agent at Bussorah was made subordinate to the Eesident in the Persian Gulf in all points con nected with the affairs of the maritime Arabs and the inhabitants in the Gulf. The following letter was addressed by this Government to Captain Taylor on the 24th September 1824 informing him of this arrangement:— ' At the time of the abolition of the Eesidency at Bagdad it was the intention of the Governor in Council that the Political Agency at Bussorah should ultimately be placed in subordination to the Residency at Bushire, and although such an arrangement does not at the present moment appear to be required as far as concerns the internal affairs of the Pachalic of Bagdad, yet from the connection of the ports of Turkish Arabia with the general system of watch and control exercised by the Resident, it is necessary that the Political Agent should attend to all instructions from that officer on points connected with the affairs of the maritime Arabs or of the inhabitants of the Persian Coast. On these last subjects you will therefore be pleased to correspond with the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and to conform to any instructions which you may receive from him. Your transactions with the Pacha of Bagdad and his Deputy at Bussorah and your interposition for the protection of the British trade at the latter port will remain on its present footing, but no measure of a general nature affecting our interests throughout the Gulf (such, for example, as the suspension of our trade with the Pachalic) is to be adopted without the previous sanction of the Resident. You will be pleased to furnish the Resident in the Gulf with copies of all your despatches, and you are authorized to make such an addition to your Office establishment as may be necessary for this purpose.' 267. In a Minute dated the 11th June 1827 the Hon^ble Mr. Elphinstone, then Governor of Bombay, recorded his opinion, which was concurred in by the other Members of the Board, of the propriety of abolishing the Political Agency in Turkish Arabia. The following is an extract from this Minute :— ' The Bussorah Residency might, I think, be easily spared, but I would not abolish it at present, because Sir J ohn Malcolm * is so much fitter to decide on the necessity of the situation; we may take it as a prospective reduction.' 268. With reference to this opinion, Sir John Malcolm, who had intermediately succeeded Mr. Elphinstone in the Government of Bombay, in a Minute dated the 12th March 1828 observed as follows:— ' Though I still keep in view the prospect of reducing the expense of our Agencies in Persia and Turkey by another arrangement for their duties, I do not think at the present moment ,when Russia may be said to be at war with the Porte, and when the Imperial forces occupy Aderbijan, that we can recall Major Taylor from Bussorah without creating impressions very unfavorable to our interests in that part of Asia.' 269. In a letter to the address of this Government, dated the 28th July 1830, the Hon^ble the Court of Directors, noticing this postpone ment, observed that, as it had been solely grounded on the w^r between Russia and the Porte, they should be happy to learn that the present position of affairs was considered such as to permit of the original inten tion for the abolition of the Bussorah Residency being carried into effect. 270. The Committee which was appointed in 1830 by the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India in Council to enquire into the then state of the finances of British India observed in the 43rd para, of their Report, that in the course of their investigation into the rise • Then Governor elect of Bombay.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 123 and progress of the different establishments in the Persian Gulf they had been induced to compare the charges at Bushire and Bussorah, with which the Government was then (1830) burthened, with those that had sufficed for the same establishments at periods when the Hon'ble Com pany's trade and intercourse in that quarter had been more active and flourishing than at the date of their report, and that the result on their minds was that no reasonable ground whatever existed for continuing such costly Agencies in the Gulf of Persia as were then maintained. The Committee accordingly recommended that one Agency alone should be maintained in the Gulf, and that Bushire should be its station. The Committee concluded this branch of their Report with the following remark:— 'The duties which will devolve on the Political Agent in the Gulf by the abolition of the Bussorah Agency will be very trifling.' The Government of India, in transmitting to this Government a copy of this Report, stated that the above suggestions had met with their entire approbation, and that so far as they were able to form a judgment the economical measures proposed were both expedient and judicious. 271. In reviewing the above proceedings the Hon'ble the Court of Directors in a despatch to the address of this Government, dated the 26th February 1834, observed that the then actual state of the Pachalic of Bagdad, and the peculiar complication of circumstances in which the relations of the various powers connected with that part of the world were at that period involved, put out of the question the idea of any change at present in the system under which the Political Agency at Bussorah was managed. The Court, however, desired that the contem plated measure of bringing the entire business of the Persian Gulf under one management might not be lost sight of, but be carried into effect whenever a change of circumstances might render that arrange ment expedient. 272. On the 6th September 1824 the Hon'ble Mr. Newnham, then a Member of this Government, recorded, with reference to the despatch from the Hon'ble the Court of Directors above alluded to, and to a letter which had intermediately been addressed to the Government of India by the Hon'ble the Secret Committee on the then unsettled state of Turkish Arabia, a Minute, from which the following is an extract, in which he advocated the abolition of the Political Agency in that country, and stated it to be his opinion that the duties devolving on that functionary could with advantage be entrusted to a Native Agent:— ' The advantages of our situation at Bushire must be permitted to be great, both past and present, and must continue to be so long as we determine to keep up our present imposing character in the Gulf, but I am at a loss to point out one specific advantage which has accrued from our establishment at Bussorah or Bagdad since the down fall of the great Napolean in 1814, nor do I know any that are to be derived in future except it be from watching the acts of the Russian Agents in that quarter. The Pacha of Bagdad is servant of the Porte, and any engagement with him personally cannot be viewed otherwise than with jealousy by the Government of Constantinople where we have a Resident Ambassador. The situation of the Resident is viewed in the Secret Committee s despatch as one surrounded with difficulties, all or either of which are more likely to involve us in ultimate embarrassment than to be attended with public good. Bussorah is no longer of any importance as a place of commerce, and no longer requires the presence of a Political functionary to watch our interests in that quarter.124; P'REGIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. ' If therefore our establishments are now to be estimated only by the actual profit or good derived from them, 1 think the residence of a respectable and intelligent Native Agent might be safely and advantageously substituted for our present establishment in Turkish Arabia. Independent of expense, this would relieve us from the trouble of sending a detachment from the marine battalion as an escort for the Resident; scarcely one passes up or down the river without meeting with interrup tions from the natives, which has either been attended with loss of life or either serious injury.' 273. The Right Hon^ble Lord Clare, then Governor of this Presi dency, with reference to the above sentiments, observed in a Minute, dated the 18th September 1834, that undoubtedly, if merely the protec tion of British commerce was required in Turkish Arabia, a Native Agent at Bussorah would answer as well as a European Political Agent; but that His Lordship was of opinion that interests purely Indian were more deeply concerned, and that looking to the connection between European and Indian politics, it appeared very doubtful to His Lordship whether it would be advisable, at all events for the present, to abolish the Political Agency in Turkish Arabia. These Minutes were forwarded on the 23rd September 1834 for the consideration of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India in Council, and in reply this Government was informed on the 9th of the following mouth that the Government of India entirely concurred in the sentiments entertained by the Right Hon'ble Lord Clare on the above subject. 274. In the year 1825-26 His Highness the Imaum of Muscat fitted out a fleet of vessels for the purpose of blockading Bussorah, in order to enforce the payment of certain arrears of tribute which His Highness demanded from the Pacha of Bagdad. The Political Agent in Turkish Arabia having received information of this intended expedi tion endeavoured, but without success, to induce the Pacha to comply with the Imaum's demand. The Imaum's vessels on their arrival estab lished a blockade of Bussorah, which induced the Pacha very shortly afterwards to comply with the whole of the demands made upon him by the Imaum, which object having been attained the blockade of Bussorah was raised and the Imaum's fleet returned to Muscat. 275. On the 21st November 1827 the Pacha of Bagdad addressed a letter to Major-General Sir John Malcolm congratulating His Excel lency on his recent appointment as Governor of Bombay, and soliciting that the British military officers enumerated below might be sent from Bombay to Bagdad for the purpose of disciplining a large body of Turkish 'Regulars' of every arm, which the Pacha had recently been directed by the Sultan to raise, ' in conformity with a new system of military arrangements lately adopted at Constantinople.'' The Pacha at the same time requested, in order that he might be enabled to resist an apprehended attack from the Russians, that he might be also furnished from Bombay with the undermentioned artificers, ships of war, and military stores :— European Horse Artillery. 1 Subaltern. 2 Non-Commissioned Officers. 1 Conductor of stores to direct the laboratory works and the manufacture of powder.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 125 European Infantry. 1 Subaltern. 2 Non-Commissioned Officers. Artists. 1 Gunsmith to direct the manufacture and stocking of muskets. 1 Indigo planter and manufacturer. Ships of War. 1 Three-masted vessel of 600 tons, with 48 guns in the upper and lower deck. 1 Ditto of 300 tons, single tier of guns. 1 Ditto of 250 tons, ditto ditto. Arms and Ammunition. 3,000 Muskets, bayonets, cross belts, cartridge boxes, &amp;c., complete. 400 Barrels of powder. 276. The Pacha agreed to defray all expenses to which the Bombay Government might be subjected in complying with the above requests, and stated that as long as they might continue in his service each of the officers and non-commissioned officers he had applied for should receive half the field pay and allowances of the rank immediately superior to his own, besides one toman a day for personal subsistence and forage for two horses, also a horse in garrison and a tent with carriage in the field. These requests were, on the 3rd April 1828, referred for the instructions of Ihe Government of India, accompanied by the strong recommendation of this Government in favor of a compliance therewith. Mr. Francis 'Warden, then a Member of this Government, alone dissenting from this recommendation, on the ground that the history of British connection with Turkish Arabia from the earliest period exhibited a series of insults and reconciliations without a redeeming advantage, political or commercial, and that the less therefore this connection was increased the more advan- taireous it would be for British interests. 277. The Government of India, however, for reasons which were explained in a letter from that Government, dated the 2nd May 1828, con sidered that it would be inexpedient to comply with the Pacha's requests, and directed therefore that they should be courteously negatived, but that an Agent whom the Pacha had deputed to Bombay should be permitted to purchase whatever military stores he chose. On these proceedings being reported by the Government of India to the Hon'ble the Secret Committee, that authority in a despatch to the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General in Council, dated the 2nd December 1828, of which a copy was with a letter of the same date furnished to this Government by the Secret Committee ' for information and guidance,' expressed their regret that the application of the Pacha to be furnished with some British commissioned and non-commissioned officers had not been com plied with; this letter which also contained rules for the guidance of the Government of India in the event of any future similar application being preferred by the Pacha was to the following effect:— ' We now proceed to reply to your letter, dated the 6th of June 1828, enclosing a copy of a letter addressed by you to the Hon'ble the Governor in Council of Bombay on126 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. the subject of the requests preferred by the Pacha of Bagdad. We perceive that your refusals to comply with those requests was partly grounded upon the apprehension that this country might even then be at war with Turkey, and that orders might even possi bly be received by the next arrivals from England to prosecute hostilities against those dependencies of the Ottoman Porte which are assailable from the side of India. ' It is unnecessary for us now to enter into any discussion of the reasonableness of this apprehension which if it was at any time justified by circumstances had ceased to exist in this country several months before the date of your letter. We believe you may now trust that it will be the constant object of His Majesty's Government to maintain the friendship which has almost uninterruptedly subsisted between this country and Turkey. It is our interest, both as an European and as an Asiatic State, that the Otto man Porte should preserve all its present power, and in all your future intercourse with the dependencies of that empire you will make the maintenance of the integrity of the Turkish dominions the unvaried object of your policy. ' The war in which the Ottoman Porte is now engaged has assumed a national and a religious character. It has united all Mabomedans in a common cause, and we do not think you need be under my apprehension that whatever strength the Pacha of Bagdad may acquire will in any case be turned against the Sultan. We do not expect that the Pacha will derive any great advantage from the services of the British officers he is desirous of having sent to him, but we should derive advantage from any influence those officers might acquire, and we should obtain by means of their constant and unsuspected intercourse with those associated with them in the Pacha's service that full information as to everything that passes in the Pachalic, which as a neighbouring power it is important for us to possess. ' There is nothing comparatively so cheap and at the same time so valuable to a Government as information. It gives to the Government which possesses it over that which has it not the advantage of a knowledge of futurity. We wish you to bear this constantly in mind not merely as regards the Pachalic of Bagdad but as all the countries to the west of the Sutlege. Information, however, is not always best obtained by ostensible agents. In many parts of Asia it will be best acquired through the extensive commercial communications of India. ' The alarm of the Pacha of Bagdad, which was occasioned by the near approach of the Russian army, being for the present removed by the restoration of peace between Russia and Persia, it is possible that he may be less desirous of obtaining the aid of British officers or less willing to pay for it, and if he should be still disposed to have Europeans in his service he may possibly, discouraged by your rejection of his requests, have recourse to other powers which will assuredly not reject the opportunity of placing their officers about him. We are desirous of having British officers in the Pacha's service, but we are still more desirous that the officers of no European power should be employed in disciplining the Pacha's troops. You will therefore take advantage of any opportunity, which may hereafter occur, of complying with any request of the Pacha similar to that which you have lately rejected as far as regards the employment of British officers in his service, but as we do not understand in what manner the possession of armed ships can enable the Pacha either to fix his authority in the extensive countries of his Pachalic, or to defend himself against a foreign enemy invading his territories by land, we desire that you will discourage all attempts on his part to establish a military marine. ' Should you be enabled to place British officers in the Pacha's service, you will take the greatest care in the selection of the individuals you send. Upon their ability and discretion must depend the whole advantage of the measure we direct you to adopt. ' You will order Major Taylor to take the proper steps for securing to us the re imbursement by the Pacha of their military pay and allowances. In the event of the Pacha's refusing to enter into a stipulation to this effect, or of his violating it, the persons you may have sent must be withdrawn from his service. 'We regret that the state of our finances should impose upon us the necessity of insisting upon this condition. 'You will permit Major Taylor to reside at Bagdad or at Bussorah as the public interests may require. It is for your consideration whether, during his absence from Bussorah, it would not be expedient that his duties should be performed there by one of our European servants.WITH TURKISH ARABIA 1646 TO 1846. 127 ' You have anticipated our wishes in permitting the Pacha of Bagdad to pur chase whatever he may require at Bombay. ' The policy of the Pacha of Bagdad will be very short-sighted should the present peace between Russia and Persia induce him to neglect any measure of pre caution which may have been suggested to him by his recent sense of danger. It is evident that that peace was only concluded by Russia on the terms to which she agreed, in order to have the army of General Paskevitz disposable for operations against the Turkish Empire. A war will be facilitated by the acquisitions of territory Russia has already made, and would be still further facilitated were she to succeed in annexing to her empire the part of the Turkish dominions in which the army of General Paskevitz is now acting. ' Even were the Councils of Russia to be governed by the moderation she professes, it would be unreasonable to expect that her Generals commanding on a frontier so distant from the seat of Government should not seek opportunities of gratifying their ambition, and the distribution among the Russian troops of a large portion of the sum lately extorted from the Shah of Persia will certainly not diminish the disposition on their part to renew the war against a power which can no longer resist, but which is still supposed to possess great treasures.' 278. On the 8tli May 1829 a letter was addressed to this Govern ment by Mr. Swinton, Chief Secretary to the Government of India, containing a request from the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General in Council that— ' instruction might be issued to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, in conformity with the views and orders contained in the above despatch,' from the Hon^ble the Secret Committee, a copy of which was accordingly forwarded by this Government to the Political Agent for his information. 279. In April 1830 Major Taylor, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, was permitted by Government, at the request of the Pacha, to pay His Highness a visit at Bagdad. On the 21st August following, the Pacha addressed a letter to the Governor of Bombay, requesting that Major Taylor might for the future be permanently located at Bagdad instead of at Bussorah: this request, however, was negatived in the following reply dated the 20th January 1831:— 'However much I desire to meet Your Highness' wishes as far as it is possible, I cannot deem it advisable for the benefit of trade, and from other considerations, that Major Taylor should remove from Bussorah, but that gentleman will have frequent opportunities of visiting Your Highness' capital. It is very gratifying to this Govern ment to learn of the kindness the Political Agent experienced at Bagdad, and the account of the improvements Your Highness has introduced in your territories, and still contemplate, has afforded me great satisfaction.' On the 12th May 1831 Major Taylor left Bagdad in consequence of the plague having made its appearance, and returned to Bussorah. In January 1832, however, the plague broke out at Bussorah, and in conse quence of its raging with great virulence, the Political Agent at the earnest request of the Pacha again removed with his establishment to Bagdad, at which place that officer has from that period permanently resided. This arrangement appears to have been adopted consequent on the authority contained in the following extract from a letter from the Hon'ble the Secret Committee to the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India in Council, dated the 28th April 1832 :— ' We think it may be more than ever expedient, under the altered state of circumstances consequent upon the appointment of the present Pacha, that your Political Agent should fix his residence chieffy at Bagdad, for the greater advantage, not only of obtain-128 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. ing accurate information of passing events, but of establishing such an influence in tbe Pacha's Councils as will be requisite for the efficient discharge of the duties properly belonging to bis office. The common duties at Bussorah can, we conclude, be easily performed by the Resident's European Assistant, if he has one, or if not, by a Native Agent under bis (the Resident's) direction.' 280. On the 12th June 1831 Daood Pacha of Bagdad, who had filled that office for a period of 14 years and 3 months, was deposed by the Sublime Porte and was succeeded by Ilajee Ali Reza Pacha. Daood Pacha had determined to oppose by force the order for his deposal, but on the approach of a large body of troops he sought shelter in the house of ' Mahomed Aga/' who promised him an asylum, but who immediately afterwards delivered him up as a prisoner, when Hajee Reza Ali was, by order of the Sultan, declared ' Pacha of Bagdad, Aleppo, Diarbekir, and Mosul/' 281. On his succeeding to the dignity of Pacha, Hajee Ali Reza issued the following ' Booyooroldi' confirming all the privileges hitherto enjoyed by the British in Turkish Arabia. This ' Booyooroldi' on its reaching the Mussaleem (Governor) of Bussorah was by his order publicly read in the Divan and afterwards registered ' in the archives of the Mehkemeh of the Kadhee and the Chancellery of the Dufturdar.' ' Translation of a Booyooroldi from Ills Highness Ilajee A li JRcza, Pacha of Bagdad, Aleppo, Diarbekir, and Mosul, to the Political Agent at Bussorah, dated the 27th Rubee-atb-tbanee, A.H. 1247, or 2nd October 1831 A.D. ' To the spiritual leader of Islam, the Lieutenant (of the Jadhee of Constantinople) at Bussorah; to His Excellency the Muftee Eftendi of Busra, whose piety and excellence be increased; to the Chief of the Exalted Ministry and Government the Mutesellim Agha, be his rank and station increased; and to the elders and men of weight of the Council and country, whose dignity be magnified. In reference to all affairs supervening at Bussorah and relating to the excellent Resident of England, the high and exalted Mr. Taylor, Balecar Beg, residing with our eternal Government, and in observance of his rights and those of his Agents, interpreters, and all his proteges and dependents, and of all the subjects of his Government and the merchants and ships arriving from Hindoostan, according to the stipulations and treaties which have been arranged and ratified with our exalted State, as they have been held in times preceding, to which we adhere, and for which we even exceed the former regard out of a wish to protect their rights: so you also the Nayeb Effendi and Muftee Eflendi and Mutesellim Agha and Ayan (inferior Ministers) will in likewise deport yourselves towards, and protect the rights and regard the just claims of the dignified Mr. Taylor, Beg, his Agents, inter preters, proteges and dependents, and the subjects of the Government arriving from Hindoostan, an 1 their ships and merchants, and all others so ever conformably to what we have promulgated in this our Booyooroldi, which you will on no account infringe, and thus be it known unto you.' 282. On the 1st July 1831 the Hon'ble the Secret Committee forwarded to this Government copy of a despatch, from which the follow ing is an extract, which that authority had on the same day addressed to the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India in Council, containing instructions for the guidance of the public conduct of the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, and for the regulation of his various public relations :— ' Our Agent in the Pachalic of Bagdad is not to regard himself as the Plenipoten tiary at the Court of a Sovereign and independent Prince. He is not to consider it as part of his ordinary duty to'mix himself with the local duties and civil contentions of the restless and unscrupulous Chiefs by whom he is surrounded. He is not at liberty to enter at his own discretion, and without instructions, into negotiations and political Official sign.WITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 129 engagements of any description. He is to recollect that we can regard the Pacha only as the dependent and subject of the Sultan, with whom we maintain amity, and at whose Court we have an Ambassador. So long as our alliance with Turkey subsists, our peculiar relations with any of the Pachas of that empire must be regulated by a reference to the paramount obligations which connect us with the master authority. ' The Company's Resident in Turkish Arabia ought, we conceive, to consider himself as acting exclusively in a consular capacity. On the duties which belong to that character it is not necessary here to enlarge, but a watchful protection of British interests and the persons of British subjects, diligence in the collection of important information, and an unfailing communication to your Government and to this country of all public events, and political changes, all these are perfectly consistent with that firm and guarded abstinence from personal interference with the internal administration, and external relations of the Pachalic, which we conceive it for our honor, no less than our interest to observe.' 283. A copy of the above despatch was forwarded by this Govern ment to Major Taylor^ on the 3rd January 1832, with orders to use his best endeavours to act up to the spirit and letter of the instructions therein contained, and scrupulously to avoid any measures or negotiations with the Pacha, or other Chiefs, who might apply to him, tending' to commit the British Government to any line of policy in the smallest degree opposed to the course laid down by the Hon'ble the Secret Committee. 284. In a further despatch, dated the 5th July 1832, the Hon'ble the Secret Committee communicated to this Government the following additional instructions for the guidance of the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, and which were communicated to that oflicer on the 29th January following :— ' In all his intercourse with the Pacha of Bagdad, the Political Agent must ever bear in mind that the Pacha is not to be regarded as an independent Sovereign, but as the temporary Governor of the Turkish Province accountable for all his acts to the Sultan, our ally, to whose sovereign rights we are bound to pay due respect, and as the Ambassador at Constantinople represents the British Government and nation at the Court of the Sultan, it is highly proper that your Agent should be instructed to communicate freely and fully with the Ambassador upon all matters that have the slightest tendency to affect our relations with the Porte. Major Taylor will of course transmit to the Government of Bombay copies of his correspondence with the Ambassador, and await instructions from thence before he acts upon any points not coming within the line of discretion which you may have prescribed for the guidance of his conduct. Major Taylor has already been told that as respects Persia his proceedings are to be regulated by the advice of the Envoy at that Court.' 285. In a letter, dated the 29th July 1833, Major Taylor (who a short period before had attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel) reported that Russia had obtained a paramount influence in the Turkish Councils. In order therefore that he might be enabled— ' to observe the current and progress of these pernicious influences, and to detect the intrigues of Russia,' Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor suggested that a discretionary permission should be given him ' to travel when and for what periods might appear to him necessary, particularly to the northern districts of the Pachalic, and even, if requisite, occasionally to reside at a point more approximate than Bagdad, to the scene of intrigue.' This suggestion was referred by this Government, on the 25th October 1833, for the decision of the Government of India, with the remark, however, that this Government was of opinion that Bagdad, as the seat of Government, was more likely to become the scene of Russian intrigue130 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. than the remote provinces of the Pachalic, and that in the then unsettled state of Turkish Arabia the Political Agent's presence was more neces sary at Bagdad than at any other place. The Government of India expressed its entire concurrence in this opinion, and directed that Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor should be instructed to confine himself to Bagdad— ' unless the home authorities should see fit to direct otherwise, with reference to the state of politics in that quarter.' Instructions to this effect were accordingly issued by this Government to Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor on the 2ist December 1883. 286. Oh the 5th December 1834 a large body of ' Azail Arabs,' who, in defiance of the Turkish authority and frequent unsuccessful endeavours which had been made to dislodge them, had held possession of the western half of the city of Bagdad for about two years and a half, made a sudden attack upon the Pacha's troops, who, although taken by surprise, steadily maintained their position, and after a severe fight, which lasted between six and seven hours, obtained a complete victory over the Arabs, who immediately fled from Bagdad. 287. On the 20th February 1835 Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor submitted to Government copy of a very interesting memoir which had been recently prepared by Mr. Fraser, who had been deputed by His Britannic Majesty's Government on amission to Persia and Mesopotamia, containing information in regard to the then condition of the Pachalic of Bagdad, and the means it possessed of renovation and improvement, accompanied by statements showing the actual revenue realized by that Pachalic in 1833-34, and the estimated amount which might be obtained ' after three years' good government.' As no copy of this memoir, which was prepared by Mr. Fraser for His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment, to whom he forwarded the original direct, has been forwarded to the Government of India, I have annexed a copy of its summary for the information of that authority {vide Appendix E). 288. On the 23rd March 1835 the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia was directed by this Govern- 'His Excellency the Right Hon'ble men f i n conformity with orders received the Governor-General of India in „ ' , „ J . « . - ii Council has been pleased to resolve that from the Government of India, With the undermentioned officers holding reference to a notification which, conse- political situations shall correspond q Uen t on the grant of the last charter, bad been issued by that authority on 'Envoy in Persia. the 20th November loon', to the ettect «' Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, quoted in the margin, hereafter to ' Resident at Buslnre, &amp;c.' address his despatches to the Govern ment of India direct, forwarding them, however, under a flying seal to this Government in order that copies might be retained. 289. On the 20th November 1834 His late Majesty King 'Willian the IV. granted the following Commission, under His Royal Sign Manual, to Captain F. R. Chesney, of the Royal Artillery, consti tuting and appointing him with the rank of Colonel, Commander of the Expedition, therein described, which His Majesty's Government had resolved on with the view of establishing an overland communicationwith turkish arabia —1646 to 1846. 131 between England and India via the Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia, by means of two steam vessels which, under a grant of £20,000 from the British Parliament, it had been resolved to send out from England vid thfi Mediterranean for the purpose of being placed on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. (Sd.) William R. 'William the IV., by the Grace of God, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, to all and singular to whom these presents shall come greeting : Whereas it has been represented to us that great advantages are likely to result not only to the commerce of our own subjects, but to that of other nations, and particularly to that of the subjects of our good ally, the high and mighty Emperor Sultan Mahomed Han II., Chief Lord and Commander of the Eastern Empire, from the establishment of a direct communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the possessions of our Crown in the East Indies, for the effectual accomplishment of which object it is proposed, among other things, to navigate by the means of steam vessels the River Euphrates flowing through the dominions of our said ancient and good ally : Now know ye that we moved by these considerations, and relying upon the friendship of our said good ally, have determined to sanction the employment of a certain number of scientific officers with the requisite number of artificers and other workmen for the purpose aforesaid, and having moreover full confidence in the zeal and ability of Colonel Francis Rawdon Chesney, an officer of our Royal Regiment of Artillery, we do hereby constitute and appoint him the said Francis Rawdon Chesney to be the Commander of the expedition as above described, and we do strictly charge and enjoin him to use his best endeavours to ensure the success thereof, and further, constantly to bear in mind our express command that he do cultivate to the utmost of his power the best understanding and friendship with the authorities of our said good ally in the districts through which the aforesaid expedition will pass, and that he do conciliate the good-will and friendship of the inhabitants of the same, not doubt ing that when this our present commission shall have been communicated to our said good ally, he will cause corresponding instructions to be given to his own servants, out of due regard for the friendship and alliance so happily subsisting between our two Courts.

On the 29th December 1834 the Sublime Porte, on the appli cation of the Right Hon'ble Lord Ponsonby, His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, granted the following firman, authoriz ing the navigation of the Euphrates River by the two steamers belong ing to the British Government about to be placed on that river. ' Translate of an Imperial Firman of protection for the English steam vessels destined to navigate the River Euphrates, dated 29th December 1834, to Their Excellencies the Vizirs, Pachas of three tails, to the illustrious Mirimirans Pachas of two tails, to the learned Judges, to the Waivodas Capitains of ports and other Magistrates of places situated on both banks of the Euphrates, Health. ' On receiving the Imperial command you will know as follows-The Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Great Britain at Constantinople, Lord 1 onsont)\, one of the most illustrious personages among the Christian nations, has presented at our Sublime Porte an official note, by which he intimates that the British Government requires permission to cause to navigate by turns two steam boats on the River Euphrates, which flows at a small distance from the city ol Bagdad, tor the purposes ot facilitating commerce.132 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. ' We in consequence issued to our very illustrious Governor of Bagdad and Bns- sorah, Ali Beza Pacha, an order to furnish our Sublime Porte with information of the proposed navigation. ' Although the answer of the Pacha had not arrived, the Ambassador made repre sentations on this point, informing our Sublime Porte the British Government awaited our reply. ' For this reason we have and do permit two steam boats to navigate the Euphrates by turns, and this navigation is to continue as long as, conformably to what has been represented to us, it may prove useful to the two powers, and no inconve nience result therefrom, and it is to this purpose that an official rule has been trans mitted to the British Ambassador. ' A firman, couched in the same terms, has been addressed to the Pacha of Bag dad and Bussorah. ' These commands mean that you should act in the mode above-mentioned and for this end the Firman is written. ' You, therefore. Vizirs, Mirimirans, Judges, and other Magistrates being informed that you are to be in harmony with my Imperial will, you are to be cautious to act in conformity thereto, and to be aware of contravening that which is prescribed by this Imperial command.' 291. With reference to the above firman, the Pacha of Bag-dad, on the 11th February 1835, issued the following ' Booyooroldi' to the Turkish officers on the Euphrates, directing them to afford their protec tion to the expedition under Colonel Chesney, and to render all assist ance in their power for the furtherance of its objects:— ' To those informed of this our address the Mutesellims, Zhabits of districts and villages, and Shaikhs of tribes on both banks, the Arabian and Mesopotamian, of the Euphrates from Oanah to Bussorah, be it known— ' That the cause of writing this ' Booyooroldi' (order) is that, as at this time, two steam vessels have arrived, appertaining to the English Government, in which are persons bearing this our order, who are passing for the pur poses of trade by permission of the Sublime Porte ; having also many letters, it is incumbent on you to protect and favor them to assist in supplying their wants, and to abstain wholly from impeding them. If, therefore, ye are certified of this, it is your duty, on the arrival of the above-mentioned individuals at and on their passage by your stations, to protect and defend, and that neither any one of you, or other, impede them in any way, and should your aid be necessary to them, that you assist and serve them in their wants, and unite, in forwarding them on their passage going and coming in peace and safety, without excuse or delay. ' And for this purpose we have written, published, and forwarded this Booyooroldi if it please God; when you receive it, and are informed of its contents, it will be requi site that you use your utmost exertions in the accomplishment of them, and act accord ing to the order, and thus it shall be suffice.' 292. Colonel Chesney left England on the 10th February 1835, with the several members and workmen composing the expedition under his command, and arrived at 'Port William' on the Euphrates on the 18th July following, when he commenced putting together the two iron steamers Euphrates and Tigris, the materials for which had been for warded by His Majesty^s Government via the Mediterranean. The comple tion of both of these vessels, and their having commenced the survey of the Euphrates and Tigris, was communicated by Colonel Chesney to the Hon^ble the Court of Directors in a letter dated the 19th March 1836, from which the following is an extract:— ' Being quite sure that no event which concerns our Indian Empire, however remotely can be indifferent to you as private individuals, whilst it is certain of attracting all the attention it may deserve from you as a great governing body, I do myself the honor of using the very earliest opportunity in my power to acquaint Your Hon'ble CourtWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1646 TO 1846. 133 that the two steamers Euphrates and Tigris are now descending the great river, sur veying carefully as the}' drop down, under every possible advantage, both vessels being completely manned, anncd, and equipped, with their boilers, engines, and machinery quite as safe, and even more perfect in their working details than when sent out of the maker's hands at Liverpool.' 293. On the 18th June 1836 Colonel Chesney addressed the fol lowing- letter from on board the steamer Euphrates to Sir John Cam Hobhousej President of the Board of Control:— ' I have the honor to inform you that this vessel reached the junction of the rivers Euphrates and Tigris during the afternoon of this day, so memorable for ever in the annals of England. We are now about 43 miles from Bussorah, and have completed the survey and descent of the splendid river Euphrates, which ends here; onwards is the Shat El Arab, which is rather a branch of the sea than a river in the ordinary acceptation of the word. The officers and men are all in good health, and the best possible spirits having arrived here without any serious difficulty or annoyance.' 294. On the 21st May 1836 the Tigris steamer was upset in the Eu phrates River during a heavy squall and foundered. By this melancholy accident Lieutenant Cockburn, of the Royal Artillery, Lieutenant Lynch, of the 26th Regiment, Bengal Native Infantry, 12 Europeans, consisting of sailors, engineers, &amp;c., and six natives were drowned. Several ineffec tual attempts have been made to raise this vessel. In October last an Arab, who, at the request of Major Rawlinson, the present Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, examined the wreck of this vessel, stated that he was of opinion that at next fall of the river her hull would be left high and dry. Major Rawlinson accordingly, on the 5th November last, referred for the instructions of the Right Ilon^ble the Governor-General of India whether, in the event of this expectation being realized, he should break up this vessel and forward her machinery to India if on inspection it should be found to be in a tolerable state of preservation. This Govern ment has not been informed of the decision of His Lordship on this subject. 295. On the 23rd January 1837 the Euphrates expedition was by order of His late Majesty^s Government broken up, and the Euphrates steamer was made over to the East India Company, on the understanding that such an amount should be paid for her as a Committee of survey miffht deem her to be worth. 296. On the 18th April 1837 the Hon^ble the Secret Committee forwarded, for the information and guidance of this Government, copy of a letter that authority had on the same day addressed to the Right Hon^ble the Governor-General of India in Council, intimating that they had appointed Lieutenant (now Commander) 11. B. Lynch, of the Indian Navy, then in England, to the command of the Euphrates steamer and of any other steamers which might subsequently be em ployed on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. The Secret Committee at the same time forwarded copy of the following letter which they had on the same day addressed to Lieutenant Lynch, directing him to proceed to Bagdad for the above purpose, and containing instructions for his guid ance after his arrival* at that place :— ' You will proceed with all convenient speed to Bagdad. On reaching that city you will report your arrival immediately to Colonel Taylor, the Hon'ble East India Company's * Lieutenant Lynch arrived at Bagdad on the 18th July 1837, and assumed charge of the Euphrates steamer.134 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E.

You will inform Colonel Taylor of our wish that you should be put in command of the Euphrates steamer and of any other steam vessel or vessels that may be employed on the Tigris or the Euphrates' Previously to the receipt of your instructions from India, you will make all necessary arrangements respecting the stores of the late expedition under Colonel Chesney, and the wreck of the Tigris, and you will take care that any engagements entered into with the Arabian tribes or other authorities in reference to those objects shall be strictly fulfilled. You will in concert with, and under the guidance of, Colonel Taylor enter into friendly communications with the tribes frequenting the rivers of Mesopotamia, and will endeavour to establish with them such relations as may be serviceable to the interests of Great Britain, and may add to the facilities for a speedy and regular transmission of mails between the Persian Gulf and the coast of Syria. 'You will be furnished with a chart of the Euphrates, executed by the late ex pedition, and you will complete the surveys of that river and of the Tigris, making such astronomical, geographical, and statistical observations as the more direct objects of the service may permit. You will report to us, and to the Indian Government, on all subjects connected with the service in which you are employed, and will exercise a sound discretion in obeying the letter and spirit of your instructions. 'The Governor-General of India in Council will be requested to defray the expenses you may incur in the recovery of the property of the Tigris, and in the fulfill ment of the engagements of the late expedition, of which you will keep a separate account, in order that they may eventually be reimbursed to the East India Company by His Majesty's Government.' 297. In June 1839 the Hon^ble tlie Secret Committee sent out from England (in frame work, via the Cape) three additional iron steamers for service on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, named the Assyria, Nimrod, and Nitocris ; the ship in which the materials for these vessels were forwarded from England arrived at Bussorah on the 22iid December 1839. In a letter, dated the 3rd December of the same month, the Secret Committee forwarded to this Government copy of a letter which that authority had on the same day addressed to the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India in Council, containing the following instructions in regard to these vessels :— ' When the three steamers, which were shipped on the Urania, shall have been put together and equipped and manned for service, it is our desire that they, together with the Euphrates steamer, should be subject to the same control and superintendence as we have already assigned for the Euphrates. It is not our wish that the Superintendent of the Indian Navy should originate any orders as to the particular duties on which four steamers on the Mesopotamian rivers should be employed; and we desired Lieutenant Lynch and the officers and others under his command may be considered as acting under the advice of Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, the East India Company's Agent in Turkish Arabia, subject to such directions as may be given by you. Copy of this letter was, on the 20th .January 1840, forwarded to the Superintendent of the Indian Navy, Lieutenant Lynch, and the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, for information and guidance.' 298. The three new vessels, above alluded to, were put together immediately on their reaching Bussorah, and from that period until May 1842 the steam flotilla on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, consisted, inclusive of the Euphrates, of four vessels, the whole being placed, in conformity with the above orders of the Secret Committee, under the charge of Commander Lynch. In consequence of orders from the Gov ernment of India, the Euphrates, Nimrod, and Assyria steamers were withdrawn from the Euphrates Flotilla for service on the River Indus, the first mentioned vessel on the 13th May, the second on the 29th June, and the third on the 13th August 1842. These three vessels arrived inWITH TURKISH ARABIA —1616 TO 1846. 135 Bombay on the 31st October following- in tow of the steamer Semiramis, and after being- repaired were, by order of the Government of India, despatched for service on the River Indus. 299. The remaining-, steamer the Nitocris, continued on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, under the command of Lieutenant Jones, of the Indian Navy, until the 4th May 1846, when, by order of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India, she was brought to Bombav for the purpose of being repaired, and arrived in this port on the 16th of the same month. His Lordship has lately referred for the instructions of the Hon'ble the Secret Committee whether, when the repairs to this vessel have been completed, she is to be sent back to the River Euphrates. 300. The total cost of the maintenance of the Euphrates Flotilla from January 1837, when the Euphrates steamer was transfernnl from Her Majesty's to the Hon'ble Company's service up to the 30th April 1843, independently of the original cost of the four vessels above alluded to, up to the period of the withdrawal of the three vessels abovemen- tioned, amounted to Rupees 3,42,348-1-4, independently of Rupees 89,547-10-9, disbursed between February 1838 and April 1843 in the maintenance of a dromedary post establishment between Bussorah, Damascus, and Beiront, formerly established in connection with the Euphrates Flotilla. According to a statement lately furnished to this Government by the Military Auditor-General, the average total annual expense incurred in the past maintenance of the steamer Nilocris on the Euphrates has been Rupees 55,098-5 per annum, being at the monthly rate of Rupees 4,591-8-5. • 301. On the 10th August 1841, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, was appointed by Her Majesty's Government British Consul at Bagdad. The following is an extract from the Right Hon'ble Viscount Palmerston's letter to Lieutenant- Colonel Taylor, informing him of this appointment and communicating instructions for his guidance in the conduct of his duties in that capa^ city:— ' Her Majesty's Government has judged that it will be advantageous to the public service that Consular power and rank should be conferred upon you ; 1 have to acquaint you that the Queen has been graciously pleased to sign a commission appointing you Her Majesty's Consul at Bagdad. This commission will be forwarded to Her Majesty's Consul-General at Constantinople, in order that the necessary exequater may be ob tained from the Sublime Porte, recognizing you as Her Majesty's Consul and Mr. Cartwright will transmit those documents to you ; I have, however, to acquaint you that it is not intended by this commission to interfere with your present position as the last India Company's Resident at Bagdad, further than to place under your super intendence the British Vice-Consul, who has lately been appointed to reside at Mussoul, and Mr. Hassan will be instructed to consider himself under your superintendence, and to attend to the instructions which you may from time to time give him for the guid ance of his official conduct.' 302. On the 7th March 1843, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, the late Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, submitted to this Government, with his favourable recommendation, an application from the Pacha of Bagdad, soliciting that he might be furnished from Bombay on his defraying their cost with 20,000 cannon shot of different sizes, and with an iron steamer similar in all respects to those (lately) employed on the Euphrates. This steamer, the Pacha stated, be intended as the foundation ' of a small fleet' he proposed to establish on the rivers of136 PRECIS OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONNECTION OF E. I. COMPY. the Ban-dad Pachalic, and His Highness solicited that Commander Lynch might be appointed to the charge of the vessel for which he had applied. This application was referred by this Government on the 18th May 1843 for the orders of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India, with the remark that even if it should be deemed expedient by His Lordship to comply with the requisitions of the Pacha, the services of Commander Lynch could not, ' in consequence of the present paucity of officers m the Indian Navy/' be spared. In reply, this Government was informed in a letter from Mr. Secretary Thomason, dated the 6th July 1843, that the Pacha's application was one which could not be complied with, and was of a nature that Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor ought not to have trans mitted to Government. 303 On the 29th June 1843, the Secret Commitee forwarded to this Government copy of a letter from a Mr. Thomas Stirling residing at Sheffield, the Agent in England for Messrs. Hector &amp; Co., merchants at Bagdad, stating that the application of the Pacha for a steamer had created considerable excitement amongst the trading community, and complaining of the general conduct of Lieutenant-Colonel Tay lor m matters of trade. copy of Mr. Stirling's letter was on receipt for warded to Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor for his explanation, and a copy of the Secret Committee's communication was on the same day forwarded by this Government to the Government of India, with the remark that this Government was of opinion that the Political Agency in Turkish Arabia had for a long time past been maintained on a scale far more expensive than was necessary, and that all the objects which either Her Maiesty's Government or the Hon'ble East India Company can desire in that quarter could be attained either by an Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf being stationed at Bussorah, or by the appointment of a Consul to Her Majesty, on something of the same footing as Her Maiesty's Consul in the territories of the Imam of Muscat, by which arrangement it was observed a saving might be made of about two-thirds of the expense at present incurred. In reply this Government was in formed in a letter from Mr. Secretary Thomason, dated the 16th September 1843, that the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India in Council was not prepared to say that the arrangement above suggested mio&gt;ht not be worthy of adoption at some f uture period, but that at the present moment when it was of so much importance to preserve peace between Persia and Turkey, which so many circumstances had tended to exasperate against each other. His Lordship in Council had deemed a different arrangement most conducive to the public interests, and that considering it to be a matter of extreme urgency that the British Gov ernment should be represented at Bagdad by an officer possessed of its confidence. His Lordship in Council had appointed Major Rawlmson, C.B., to the situation of Political Agent in Turkish Arabia in super- session of Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor. 304 This Government was at the same time furnished with copy of a letter which had on the same day (16th September 1843) under the orders of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-Genral of India in Council been addressed to Major Rawlinson, informing him of his having been appointed to the above charge, and containing instructions tor his Guidance in the discharge of the duties devolving on him. In compliance with a request made to this Government by His Lordship in Council,with turkish arabia —1646 to 1846. 137 orders were on reeeipt of the above letter issued to the Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Commanders of the vessels of the Indian Navy- employed in that quarter to attend to any requisitions or instructions they might respectively receive from Major Kawlinson on his assuming charge of the duties of Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. 305. The instructions of the Government of India to Major Rawlinson above alluded to were to the following effect:— ' The Governor-General in Council has directed me to inform you that he has appointed you Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. His Lordship in Council has adopted this measure in the earnest desire to preserve peace between Persia and Turkey, and in the confidence that you will most zealously devote all your exertions to the accom plishment of this object; you will feel that your efforts can only be effectually aided by the reliance of both Governments upon your perfect impartiality in every question which exists or which may arise between them, and you will so acter as to induce them to place their reliance upon you. ' You will keep yourself in constant communication with Her Majesty's Ministers at the Courts of Constantinople and Teheran ; you will afford them all the information you obtain taking special care to sift the information you may receive, and to transmit it to Her Majesty's Ministers with such remarks as may lead them to attach the just value to the facts stated. You will in all cases endeavour to carry out the views of Her Majesty's Ministers at Constantinople and Teheran whenever they may be communicated to you, and any instructions you may deem it necessary to give to the Political Agents of the Government of India in the Persian Gulf will be in entire conformity with the spirit of the instructions you may so receive; you will understand that the sole object of your mission is the preservation of peace and the creation of a good understanding between the Governments and subjects of Persia and Turkey, and you may be assured that the Governor-General in Council will place the most favorable interpretation upon your conduct zealously directed to the attain ment of this result.' 306. Major Eawlinson, who was in Calcutta when the above appointment was conferred upon him, proceeded by land to Bombay, when on his arrival he was provided with a passage to Bussorah in Her Majesty's Brig of War Clio. Major Rawlinson reached Bussorah on the 25th November 1843; on his arrival at which place he, in conformity with the instructions of the Government of India, at once entered upon the discharge of his duties as Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. Major llawlinson arrived at Bagdad on the 6th of the following month. 307. Under a Resolution of the Government of India, communi cated to this Government by that authority on the 13th April 1844, the audit and adjustment of the accounts of the Political Agents in Turkish Arabia have, from that date, been conducted by the Civil Auditor at Calcutta, instead of as previously by the Civil Auditor at this Presi dency. 308. On the 5th March 1844, Major Rawlinson was appointed by Her Majesty's Government Consul at Bagdad in succession to Lieute nant-Colonel Taylor. In informing Major Rawlinson of this appoint ment the Right Hon'ble the Earl of Aberdeen intimated to him that he was to be guided by the instructions which had been issued to his predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, on his appointment to the same office on the 10th August 1841, alluded to in paragraph 301 of this summary.

In times past the Queen of the aforesaid kingdoms sent divers of her esteemed gentlemen and persons of quality with letters and ships to this Imperial high port (the refuge of the Princes of the world and the retreat of the Kings of the whole universe) in the happy times of famous memory of my ancestors, now placed in paradise, whose souls be replen ished with divine mercy, which gentlemen and presents were gratefully accepted, making declaration and offering in the name of the said Queen, on entire good peace and pure friendship, and demanding that their subjects might have leave to come from England into our ports. Our said ancestors of happy memory did then grant their Imperial license, and gave into the hands of the English nation divers, especial and Imperial commands, to the end that they might safely and securely come and go into these dominions, and in coming or returning either by land or sea, in their way and passage, that they should of no man be molested or hindered.

The desire of His Majesty being declared in the Imperial pre sence of our said grandfather. Sultan Ahmed Han, was presently granted, and he gave express command and order that the said peace and friend ship should be renewed and fortified, and the ancient capitulations and privileges confirmed, and that the new desired Articles should be inserted and added to the Imperial capitulation, granting further to the English nation all those Articles and further privileges which were given and written in any capitulation with other nations, potentates or Kings, in peace and amity with this Imperial port. And by this Imperial command he gave order that these his Imperial commands should be obeyed of all men and the tenor of them duly observed.

XXVII. All these privileges and other liberties granted to the English nation, and those who come under their protection by divers Imperial commands, whether before or after the date of these Imperial capitulations, shall be always obeyed and observed, and shall always be understood and inter preted in favour of the English nation according to the tenor and true contents thereof.

Neither of the English nation, nor of any trading under their No Hassapie duties. banner there, shall not be demanded nor gathered one asper nor any money in the name of imposition Hassapie or compositions for flesh for the Janizaries. XXXIII. There having been in times past a difference between the Ambassa dor of the Queen of England and the French Ambassador, both Resident in our port, about the merchants of the Dutch nation, both which Ambassadors sent their petitions to our Imperial stirrup and made request that the said Dutch merchants coming into our dominions should pass under their banner, which request of both Ambassadors was granted under our Imperial seal notwithstanding Linan Bassa, the son of Cagala, Captain of the sea, now deceased, as Admiral, and practised in maritime cases, having advised the Imperial Majesty that it was fit and convenient that the Dutch nation should be assigned to the protec tion of the Ambassador of England, and that it should be so written in their capitulation, which opinion being by all the Viziers approved, by express order and Imperial authority, it was commanded that the Dutch merchants of the provinces of Holland, Zealand, Freezeland and Gelderland, that is the merchants of those four provinces, trading in our dominions shall always come under the banner of the Queen of England as all other English do. And that of all the goods and merchandize which they or do import or export to and from our dominions in their vessels they shall pay the duties of Consulage and all other duties to the Ambassador or Consul of the Queen of England, and[ ix ] that never hereafter the French Ambassador or Consul shall insinuate or intermeddle therein, and accordingly it was commanded that, for the time to come, it should be ruled and observed according to this present capitulation. After which there being arrived another Ambassador at this High port, sent from the King of England with letters and presents, which were most acceptable, the said Ambassador did make request that certain other necessary Articles should be added and written in the Imperial capitulations, of which the first was, as in times past, in the days of one of our forefathers of famous memory. Sultan Suliman Khan, there was granted a certain capitulation and privilege that the merchants of the Spanish nation. Portugal, Ancona, Sevilla, Florence, Catalonia and all sorts of Dutchmen and other merchant strangers might safely and securely go and come through all the places of our dominions and trade and traffic, granting unto them, moreover, that in any part of our empire they might establish their Consuls, but it being that every nation apart was not able to defray the charge and maintenance of a Consul, it was then left to their will and choice to come under the banner of such Ambassador or Consul as should bes^ like them, provided that it were an Ambassador or Consul of a King in peace and amity with our high port, upon which grant and other privileges given them, there were often granted divers Imperial commands and constitu tions,' being so desired by merchant strangers, who of their own will plected to trade under the banner and protection of the Ambassador and Consul of the King of England, and whilst in all scales and poits in these parts they had refuge to the banner and protection of the English Consuls, it seemeth that the French Ambassador by some means having a new gotten into their capitulations, that the said merchant strangers should come under their banner, did endeavor to force them in all scales to their protection, for which cause the controversy was again renewed and referred to our Diwan or great Council, which after a due examination and a new election permitted to the will and choice of the said merchants, they again did desire to be under the protection of the Ambassador of the King of England, notwithstanding it being made known to the Imperial port that as yet the French Ambassador did not desire to molest the said merchants nor to force them under his protection. The liist Article written in the French capitulations that the merchant strangers should come under their protection was, by the Imperial command, made void and annulled, and to the end that, according to the ancient custom of the said merchant strangers, they should always come under the banner and protection of the Ambassador or Consuls of England, and that never hereafter they should be vexed or troubled by the French All strangers to come under the Eng- Ambassador ; in this point the said lish protection. Ambassadors of His Alajcsty or Xing 1 - land having desired that this particular should be written and enrolled in this new Imperial capitulation, this present Article was according y inserted, and by the Imperial authority it is commanded, that for ever in time to come merchants of the said Princes in the mentioned foim and according to this Imperial command in their hand shall always be under the banner and protection of the Ambassador and Consuls ot England.[ X ] XXXIV. There shall never be permitted or granted any Imperial commands No Imperial command contrary to contrary to the tenor and Articles of these Articles to be granted. this Imperial command or capitulation, nor in prejudice of this our peace and amity, but in such occasion the cause shall first be certified to the Ambassador of England residing at the port, to the end that he may answer and object any scandalous action or other pretence which might infringe the peace and league. XXXV. ,nts o For enforcing Consulage. The English merchants of all the merchandize which they shall bring or transport in their ships, having paid the custom, they shall also pay the right of Consulage to the English Ambassador or Consul. XXXVI. The English merchants and all under their banner shall and may Permission to trade in all parts of safely throughout our dominions trade, the Turkish dominions. buy, sell (except only commodities prohibited) all sorts of merchandize, likewise either by land or sea they may go and traffic or by the River Tainais, in Moscovia, or by Russia, and from thence may bring their merchandize into our empire, also to and from Persia, they may go and trade, and through all that part newly by us conquered, and through those confines without the impediment or molestation of any of our Ministers, and they shall pay the custom and other duties of that country and nothing more. XXXVII. The English merchants and all under their banner shall safely trade ^ and negotiate in Aleppo, Cairo, Scio, Three per cent, custom. 0 0 n . &lt;• j Smyrna and in all parts or our domi nions, and according to our ancient customs of all their merchandize they shall pay three in the hundred for custom and nothing more. XXXVIII. The English ships which shall come to this our city of Constantinople, if bv fortune of seas or ill weather, V essels torced by weather. ^ i they shall be torced to Latta or to such like port, as long as the English will not unlade and sell their own mer chandize and goods, no man shall enforce them nor give them any trouble or annoyance, but in all places of danger the Caddees, or other of our Ministers, shall always protect and defend the said English ships, men and the goods that no damage may come unto them, and with their money may buy victuals and other necessaries, and desiring also with their money to hire carts or vessels which before were not hired by any other, to transport their goods from place to place, no man shall do them any hindrance or trouble whatever.[ xi ] XXXIX. The English nation of all the merchandize which in their ships shall be brought to Constantinople, or to Oood, not landed to pa, no enstom. any other part o£ our dominion3) which they shall not desire of their own accord to land or sell, of such goods there shall not be demanded or taken any custom at arrival at any port, and having landed their merchandize and paid their customs and other duties they may quietly and safely depart without the molestation of any man. XL. In regard to English ships coming into our dominions do use often times to touch in some parts of Africa and there take in pilgrims and Maho metan passengers to transport them to Alexandria, and arriving at that port it seemeth that the customers and other officers do pretend to take custom of all goods which are found in their ships before the merchants are willing to land any; by occasion of molestation they have forborne to transport any pilgrims, and in like manner their ships which come to Constantinople and carry divers merchandize to transport part thereof to other places, the customers and farmers would enforce to land and pretend to take custom thereof, wherefore we do command that all the English ships which with their merchandize shall come into the port of Constantinople, Alexandria, Tripoli of Syria, Scanderoon or into any port whatsoever of our empire, according to use, they shall pay only custom of such goods which with their own will they shall design to sell, and such other merchandize as they discharge not from their ships willingly, our customer shall not demand nor take custom, nor other duties, but they may transport them whithersoever they please. XLI. And if it shall happen that any of the said English nation or any under their banner shall commit man- Matters Of manslaughter. slaughter, bloodshed, or any other like offence, or that there shall happen any cause appertaining to the law or justice, until the Ambassador or Consul shall be present to examine the cause, the Judges nor other Ministers shall not decide nor give any sentence, but such controversy shall always be declared in the presence of the Ambassador or Consul, or to the end that no man be judged or condemned contrary to the law and the capitulations. XLII. Whereas it is wi'itten in the Imperial capitulations that the goods landed out of any English ship which Foreigner's Consulage to be paid. ^ come ^ our dominions and p a y custom ought also to pay the duty of Consulage to the English Ambassa dor or Consul, it seemeth that divers Mahomedan merchants, Sciots and other merchants in peace and amity with this Imperial port and other merchant strangers do deny and refuse to pay the right of Consulage, wherefore it is commanded that all the merchandize which shall be laden[ xii ] upon their ships and have paid custom, be they goods of whomsoever, according to ancient Imperial capitulations, they shall pay the right of Consulage to the Ambassador or Consul of England without any contradiction. XLIII. That the English merchants which trade at Aleppo and those under their banner of all the silk which they andF k rtmch ay ^ CUSt0m aS Venetiau3 shall buy and land upon their ships shall pay the custom and other duties as the French and Venetian merchants do pay and not one asper or farthing more. XLIV. As the Ambassadors of the King of England, which shall be T . . , . , resident in this Imperial Court, are the lntpmrptftT «j havft hpptisp rn ^npnu- 1 the sense of the Ambassador or Consul. Representatives and Commissioners of the person of His Majesty, so the interpreters are to be esteemed the Commissioners of the Ambassador, therefore for such matter as the interpreters shall translate or speak in the name, or by the order of the Ambassador, it being found that that which they have translated to be according to the will and order of the Ambassador or Consul, they shall be always free from any inputation or punishment, and in case they shall commit any offence our Minsiters shall not put any of the said interpreters in prison, nor beat them with out knowledge of the Ambassador or Consul. In case any of the r. , . « English interpreters shall die, if he be an Englishman, all his goods or faculties shall be possessed by the Ambassador or Consul of England, but if he shall be a subject of our dominion, they shall be consigned to his next heir, and having no heir they shall be taken into our bixchequer. And as in this particular, so also in all other, the abovementioned Articles and privileges granted by our forefathers of happy memory, it is expressly commanded and ordained that all our slaves shall ever obey and observe this Imperial capitulation, and that the peace and amity shall be respected and maintained without any violation whatsoever. XLV. Since which time of our forefathers of famous memory and the grant of these abovementioned Capitu- No command valid against the capi- lations. Articles, and establishment of tnlatmns. ' , peace and amity, the said King 01 England, having in the time of our grandfather of happy memory, Sultan Mahomet Han, sent one of his well desired Ambassador, a person of quality of this high port, to confirm this peace. Articles, and Capitu lations which Ambassador did declare that often times there were to divers persons Imperial commands granted, surreptitiously procured, contrary to the tenor and Articles of the Imperial capitulations, which being without our knowledge presented to our Judges and Governors, and the dates of such commands being more fresh than those of our Imperial capitulations, the Judges and Ministers do put in execution the private commands prejudicial and contrary to these[ xiii ] Imperial. To the end therefore, that for the time to come, such com mands shall not be accepted of any, but that the Imperial capitulations mig-ht be always observed and maintained according 1 to the sincere meaning-, the said Ambassador demonstrating the sincerity of His Majesty, and his request herein to our Imperial knowledge, which was most acceptable in conformity thereunto, it was expressly ordered that all such commands which already have been or shall hereafter be granted, which are or shall be repugnant to the tenor of these Imperial capitula tions, whatever such commands shall be, when presented before our Caddees or other Ministers, should never be accepted or put into execution, but that always the tenor of the Imperial capitulations shall be observed, „ . * . * . | and whosoever shall present such com- Sucli commands to be taken away. . ,, 1 . ,, mands contrary to the capitulations, they shall be taken from him and in no wise be of any force or validity. In which time also, on the part of our said grandfather, all the above written privileges. Articles, and Capitulations were accepted and ratified, and the peace, amity, and good correspondence anciently contracted was anew of him confirmed and established. XLVI. In the time of the inauguration of the Sultan Osman Han, in the Imperial and high throne, the Kin^ of England did again send a famous and noble gentleman, his Ambassador, with letters and presents which were most acceptable, and the said Ambassador desiring- in the name of Ilis King- and Lord that the ancient Capitulation, Articles, and contracts, granted in the day of our forefathers, should be of him renewed and confirmed, and the ancient peace and amity anew forti fied and established, which his request was to the said Sultan Osman most acceptable, and the ancient capitulations. Articles, privileges, herein written and confirmed, and the long since contracted peace and amity by him promised and accepted. XLVII. After whom in like manner in the days of Sultan Osman Han the King of England having again sent unto this high port his Ambassa dor the excellent and Hon'ble Sir Thomas Roe, Knight, with his letters and presents, which were most acceptable, and proffering in the name of 1 the King 1 , his Lord, all good terms of friendship and good correspondence, and desiring that the ancient capitulations and all the articles from his ancestors and from himself, formerly granted to the English nation, might be anew confirmed, and the peace and league long since between both parties contracted and ratified, and that some other Articles, very necessary, might be added to the Imperial capitula tions, and divers others already granted might be renewed, amended, and in a better form explained, which his request and demand was very acceptable unto him, and in conformity thereunto the ancient and Impe rial capitulations and all the Articles and other privileges in them often confirmed, and the peace, amity and good correspondence contracted in the times of his ancestors, grandfather and father, and himself con firmed, were again by Sultan Osman then ratified, established, promised, and accepted, whereupon by him there was express command given[ xiv ] that for the time to come the tenor of his renewed capitulations should be of every one observed, and that all men should be careful and re spectful to the said peace and friendship established and contracted on both parts, and that no man should presume to violate or to do any act contrary thereunto, which Ambassador did often declare that the Caddees and other of our Ministers, in many places and provinces, contrary to the Imperial capitulations and will of the Imperial Majesty, have imposed and laid divers taxes, burdens, and monies upon the said English nation, and those under their banner, for which cause, as it is above declared, it being- found necessary to make additions of some new Articles in the said Imperial capitulation, of which the said Ambassador made declaration in writing, and presented the same to the Imperial presence, the said Sultan Osman Han, with his Imperial hand and seal did presently give express order and command that in the time to come all those Articles and privileges which were already in the Imperial capi tulation, and those articles which now are therein by our order newly added, shall be of all our subjects and slaves duly obliged and observed according to the sincere meaning of these our Imperial capitulations. XLVIII. Inasmuch as it is publicly known that certain pirates of Tunis Against the pirates of Kartory. and Algiers, contrary to onr Imperial capitulations, mind, and will, do take and rob in the seas the ships, merchandize, and men subject to His Majesty of England and of other Kings and States in league with this our Imperial port to the great damage and injury of the said English nation, we do command, and by these presents we do ordain that several Imperial commands be given for the entire restitution of all goods and merchandize to the English nation so taken away, and that all such Englishmen as have been taken and made slaves or imprisoned by the said pirates shall be immediately set free, and after the date of these our Imperial capitulations, if it should be known that the said pirates of Tunis and Algiers shall rob them again and shall use and continue their outrages and will not restore their goods and men, we do command that the said pirates be not received into any port of our dominions, especially into the scales of Tunis, Algiers, Modon, or Coron, our Beglerbeys and other Ministers shall not suffer them to enter, nor harbour, nor receive them, but the Beglerbeys, Caddees, or other Ministers, shall persecute, banish, and punish them. XLIX. Being informed that in our dominions many of our customers and t , t . , v . i other officers in Aleppo, contrary to the No rest to be taken. T . , , .. rr ■, J ■, « Imperial capitulations under colour or taking custom and rest upon silk of the English merchants, have violently taken from the said merchants a great sum of money, and whereas in the Imperial capitulations it is written that for silk which the English shall buy in Aleppo they shall pay, as the French and Venetian merchants do, and no more, notwithstanding the said customers, besides the two and half per cent, for custom and rest, have taken from that nation a great sum of money, lately under the name of rest, wherefore[ XV ] we command that this business shall be examined, and that the said money be restored back, and for the time to come the ancient custom may be kept, and that this nation shall only pay as the French and Venetian do, and that never be taken one asper by name of such imposition. L. Whereas the English merchants, resident in Galata, ordinarily pay The discharge ef one eustomer » divers goods and merohandize before sufficient acquittance against him that they can lade or send them away upon succeeds. their ships, and do pay unto the custo mers the custom of the said goods, receiving a bill or acquittance to have paid the same, and after carry the same merchandize to their own ware houses, in the meantime before they can load and send away the said- goods, it happens that either the customer dies or is removed from his charge and the new customers will not accept of the said acquittance, but pretend another custom, troubling and molesting them many ways, wherefore we command that of all the merchandize which they shall buy, it appearing really that he hath paid once his custom, the customer shall accept of the said acquittance and shall not demand of the merchant a second custom. LI. It being usual to buy in Augora camblets, Mohario silks and other sorts of merchandize which they trans- No custom to be paid twice. port to Constantinople and other places of our dominions, and pay their customs taking acquittances for the same, and to put the goods in their own warehouses, and after being desirous to ship them away, the customers do demand again the custom, therefore, for the time to come, when the said merchants shall desire to lade such goods, and if it be true that they have already paid them custom of such merchandize, they shall not demand any second or new customs provided that the said merchants do not mingle their goods which have not paid custom with those which have already paid custom. LII. The English merchants, of all the merchandize which they shall bring into our dominions, and of the merchandize which they carry out of our dominions, as silks, camblets, and other goods, having paid the custom and not sold the goods unto another, and being afterwards to ship it away for Scio, Smyrna, or any other scale, and the said goods there arriving, the customers and officers shall always accept of their acquittances, which they have in their hands, and shall not take other custom of their merchandize. LIII. The English merchants of all the commodities which they shall bring to Constantinople or to any other Mestaria shall he paid at Galata. port of our dominion ^ and 0 f a ll such as they shall transport, the mestarage of Galata and Constantinople shall take their mestaria or brokidge according to the ancient canon and[ x vi ] usance, that is, of such merchandize as of old custom was wont to pay it, of such they shall only take mestaria, but of such merchandize as was anciently accustomed to pay it, shall not be taken, contrary to the ancient canon. Further, upon the English mer- ra,8Cd ' We ' he chandlze , there shall net bo made or laid any impositions or other duties, nor from the said nation shall not be taken one azper more which shall be contrary to the ancient canon and accustomed usance. LIV. The English nation shall and may freely come into all the ports of our dominions to negotiate and bring in cloth, kersie, spice, tin, lead, and all other merchandize, and no man shall do them any hindrance or molestation. In like manner, except only goods prohibited, they shall and may buy and export all sorts of merchandize, without the prohibition or moles tation of any man, and the customers and the other officers of the said nation having paid their custom, according to this Imperial capitulation and the ancient use, shall not demand of them anything more. In the time of the happy memory of my uncle. Sultan Murat Han, the King of England sent his Ambassador, Sir Saikvill Crow, Baronet, with his pre sents and letter, which was received in good part, and the time of his Embassy being expired. Sir Thomas Bendish arrived to reside at the port with his presents and courteous letter, the which was in the man ner well accepted, and the said Ambassador having tendered the Impe rial capitulations formerly granted, that, according to the ancient canon, they might be renewed, it is hereby again commanded that all the points and particular Articles therein be observed and maintained. LV. And because, contrary to the sense and tenor of them, the ships of No goods to be forced violently out the English merchants before they of the ships. arrive at the scale, several officers did go upon them and violently force out of the ships the goods of the merchants, taking away the choice of them, without agreeing for the price, or making any account with the owners. LVI. And furthermore the said merchants having once paid the custom for their goods in the Custom House, Abuses to be redressed in customs. i i • j * , &lt; , , i and being desirous to transport the same goods into another scale, the customers did hinder and detain them until he received another second custom for them. LVII. And whereas in the Imperial capitulations it is expressed that in x , . -, all the differences and suits with the English nation our Magistrates are not to hear nor decide the cause unless their Ambassador be there present, ofxvii ] late our Judges, without the knowledge of their Ambassador, have con demned, imprisoned, and taken presents from the English nation, which is a great wrong done to them. LVIIL Also whereas in the Imperial capitulations it is ordered that the t - t . customers shall not take any custom for No customs upon money. , tt ,, i ,, -n t i such gold and dollars as by the English nation shall be brought in or carried out of our Imperial dominions, and that the merchants are to give only 3 per cent, for the custom of their goods and no more, the ^customers notwithstanding do pretend to take custom for their chequeens and dollars and to take more custom „ ... than their due for their raw silks, which they buy and of the goods which they land at Scanderoon to carry up to Aleppo ; they demand 6 per cent., which unjust exactions have been heretofore rectified and redressed with an express Hattisheriff, but being now again informed that the said English merchants are as before wronged by reason that the customers do value and estimate the goods of the English merchants more than they are worth, and though the customers are to have but 3 per cent., yet on over-valuation of the goods they take from them 6 per cent., and the servants of the custom house, under pretence of small duties and expenses, wrongfully take great sums of money from them, and a greater number of waiters being put aboard the English ships than theretofore A greater number of guardians not to have been used, the charges thereof are bj put aboard our ships than usual. a great expense to the merchants and masters of ships that sustain it. To all which we being requested for redress do command that when the customers do set great values upon their goods the merchants offering to them according to the rate of 3 per cent, in specie of the same goods, the customers shall not refuse, but accept the same, and being desired by the English Ambassador that the above specified abuses and injustice should be rectified, we do command that, contrary to the Imperial capitulations, the English merchants be neither in the foregoing particulars nor in any other manner troubled, nor their privileges unjustly infringed. The Ambassador of the King of Great Britain, Sir Heneage Finch Knight, Earl of Winchelsea, Viscount Maidstone, Baron Fitzerherbert of Eastwell, Lord of the Royal Manor of Wye, and Lieutenant of the County of Kent and City of Canterbury, whose end may it terminate with bliss, did arrive with his presents and with all sincerity and affec tion, was accompanied with letters amply expressing in good friendship and correspondence, and the above said Ambassador both presented the capitulations that they might be renewed according to the canon, and that some Articles of great consideration, which were before in the capitulations, may be more punctually observed; the said Ambassador did desire that they might be again renewed and more plainly expressed in the Imperial capitulations; his request was graciously accepted, one of which points is this :— LIX. That the gallies and other vessels of the Imperial fleet departing the dominions of the Grand Signor and meeting on the sea withxviii ] the ships of England, they shall in no wise give them molestation nor detain them in their voyage, nor take from them anything whatsoever, but ought always to show to one another good friendship, without doing the least damage, and it being thus declared in the Imperial capitulations, The pirates of Barbary not to search 13eys and C aptains, who sail upon the our ships for strangers' goods. seas, and those of Algier, Tunis and Tripoli, meeting English ships, which sail from one port to another, ought not to take from them any money or goods upon pretence that their ships transport enemies' goods and thereupon search them and with this colour molest and detain them from prosecution of their voyage, so that only at the mouth of the castles and in the ports where the searchers, belonging to the customs, usually come aboard their goods shall be examined, but on the sea they shall be liable to no further search or inquisition. LX. And contrary to the Articles of the Imperial capitulations the goods of the English nation ought to receive Customs being paul the customer no mo l es tation, having once paid the not to deny the Teskere. . 111,1 , i custom, nor shall the customers deny to give the Teskere, or certificate, that the custom is paid, for upon com plaint hereof we strictly command that the aforesaid customers do not defer immediately upon demand to give the TesJcere or certificate. LXI. And the custom being once paid to any sort of merchandize not 1 . . , , sold in that port, which is to be trans- A second custom not he aemandea. , , . 1 ■, . • ■.•. ported to another scale, entire credit shall be given to the Teskere and a second custom shall not be so much as further pretended. LXII. In Aleppo, Cairo and other parts of the Imperial dominions the All goods in English ships, as well as English merchants and their servants those of the growth and manufacture may freely and frankly trade and for of England, not to pay above 3 per a |l their goods and merchandize pay cent, custom. 0I1 ly three per cent. According to the former customs and the Imperial capitulations whether the goods be brought by sea or by land, and though the customers and farmers, upon the arrival of the goods at the scale to give molestation and trouble to the English nation, pretend that the goods of the growth and manufac ture of England ought only to pay 3 per cent., but goods brought from Venice and other places are obliged to pay more, and with this colour and pretence occasion suits and troubles to the English, wherefore in this point let the Imperial capitulations be observed as in former times, and our officers ought in no wise to permit the contrary hereunto. LXIII. An Englishman becoming indebted or having made himself pledge Without pledge or suretyship an for another, who is either failed or run Englishman not to answer for other. away, the debt ought to be demanded of[ xix ] the debtor, and if tte creditor have no Hoget that such a one according- to the law hath made himself pledge and security, the debt shall not be demanded of the other, which Article is already declared in the capitu lations. LXIV. Whereas sometimes an Englishman living in a country to free Bill of exchange not accepted can- himself fiom a debt, draws a bill of not be enforced. exchange upon another Englishman who has no effects of his in his hands, and the person to whom the money is payable, being a man of power and authority, brings his bills and, contrary to the law and the capitulations, demands and forces pay ment of the bill, in which case the merchant accepting the bill shall be obliged to satisfy it, but not accepting of it he shall be liable to no further trouble. LXV.

Appendix B. The late Ambassador of the King of England, who resided in our high port, being dead. Sir John Finch Knight, a prudent man, and one of the Council of foreign trade, is appointed to succeed him in the charge of the Embassy, and notice being given to our noble presence that the said Ambassador was arrived with the Royal Letters, and the usual presents, they were acceptable to us, and the aforesaid Ambassador having made known to us that in the capitulations already granted there were several expressions so full of ambiguity that they needed further expla nation, and to this end having requested of us, in the behalf of the King his master, that the capitulations might be renewed and that such expla-[ XX 1 nations and additional articles as were necessary might be added to them ; the request of the said Ambassador being made known to us, we have consented to it, and we do command and be it commanded that the addi tions desired be added to the former capitulations of what, one is:— I. The Nisani Sheriff (that is) the Imperial command, upon which was put the Hutti Sheriff (that is) the hand of the Emperor Sultan Ibrahim Han (whose soul rest in glory) in the year 1053, which Command declares that anciently the English ships that came to Scanderoon did pay to every cloth of London for the custom of Scanderoon forty paras and for a piece of kersey six paras, and for every bundle of cony skins, six paras, and for tin and lead for every quintal of Damas cus or cantars fifty-seven paras and a half for custom, which goods afterwards arriving in Aleppo did pay for the custom of Aleppo, for every cloth of London, eight paras, for a piece of kersey, eight paras and one-sixth, and for every bundle of cony skins eight paras and one-sixth for tin and lead for every battman of Aleppo, one para for custom, and the said nation buying goods and transporting them for what they bought in Aleppo, and exported did pay for raw cloth of linen or chillies for cardovans for hara sani Hindi, for every bale of each two dollars and a half, and for every bale of cotton yarn a dollar and quarter, and for a bale of gualo a quarter of a dollar, and for every bale of silk ten Osmani (of which fourteen make a dollar), for rhubarb and such like drugs three dollars for every hundred, according to the estimate of the Chief in that art. The said goods carried to Scan deroon and there loaded upon their ships did pay for raw linen cloth or chilies, for cordovans each a dollar and a half the bale, for the custom of Scanderoon for hora sani Hindi and cotton yarn three quarters of a dollar the bale, for a bale of gaals one quarter of a dollar, for rhubarb and like drugs, according to the esteem of druggists, three quarters of a dollar the bale, and nothing more is to be.or ought to be paid according to the tenor of this sublime command, and if the Tefterdar shall give any command contrary to this, let it not be obeyed, but be esteemed invalid, but let everything be observed conformably to this Imperial com mand and Imperial capitulations. II. The English merchants for all goods exported or imported paid three per cent, only and never ought to pay an asper more, it being so specified in the Imperial capitulations, but there having in the scales of Constantinople and Palata arose contracts and differences with the customers concerning the Lohdras, or cloth brought from London, or other sorts of cloth of the English manufacture they shall pay according to the accustomed and ancient canon, and as they have always hitherto paid, that is to say of full aspers or sort money, of which aspers eighty make a piece of eight, and seventy a lion dollar, aspers one hundred and forty- four for every piece of cloth of English fabrics, whether fine or coarse, and of whatsoever price, and the customer shall not demand more nor ought to take more, but the cloth that comes from Holland and other countries, viz., Londrini, says, and scarlets and other sorts of cloth, not[ xxi ] English fabric, shall pay for the future that which hitherto has been the accustomed duty and at the scale of Smyrna shall be paid according- to the ancient custom and use of full aspers or short money, of which aspers eighty make a piece of eight, and seventy a lion dollar—aspers one hundred and twenty for every piece of English cloth whether fine or coarse, whether Londra or not, provided that it be of the fabric of England, and the customer shall not demand nor ought to take one asper more and let no innovation be made upon the custom of the said cloths. III. The capitulations being known which command that the English having a controversy, the import of which is above four thousand aspers that the cause shall be brought to the Porta and tried nowhere else; if at any time the Caddee or Ministers of any place which detain any merchant or hinder any Englishman that comes upon a ship from prose cuting their voyage, by reason of any money imposed upon them, or pre tended from them, if the Consul of the place will give security to answer the pretensions made before the Porta, such persons shall be free and at liberty to prosecute their voyage, and they that pretend anything of them, let them come to the Divan for to be judged and let the Ambassador defend them from those that come to demand, but if the Consul will not be security then let the Judge of the place give sentence. IV. In Constantinople, Scanderoon, Smyrna, and Cyprus, and all other ports and scales of my Empire whatsoever English ships shall arrive, they shall pay three hundred aspers for anchorage or port charges, and there shall not nor ought not to be taken or paid one asper more. V. An Englishman coming with effects and turning Mussulman, the Ambassador or Consul knowing that such effects do belong to other English merchants, let all the money and other effects be taken out of the hand of such a Mussulman, and consigned to the Ambassador to the end that he may transmit them to whom they do belong; that by this means no goods of other man may remain in the hands of such a Mussul man, and let not this be hindered by the means of any Caddee or other Judges or Ministers. VI. Any of the aforesaid English nation having camblets. Mohairs, or Grogram yarn in Angora or Beyleazar, if they will export the said goods from those places after having paid 3 per cent, for the custom of such goods they export, let them not be molested for Ikraz Batch, that, is, for passage or exportation and there neither shall nor ought to be taken upon the account of any such demand one asper. VII. Any English merchant being to receive from his debtor any sum of money, if the said debt be recovered by the means and help of an assist ant or Chians, he that recovers the debt shall pay no more than what is paid to other Caddees, which is two aspers only and not one asper more.[ xxii VIII. There passing good correspondence between us and the King o£ England out of regard of this good friendship, we do grant that two ships lading of figs, raisins, or currants may be yearly exported for the use of His Majesty^s kitchen if there be not a dearth and scarcity of such fruit in the country, which we allow to be brought with their money that export them at the scale of Smyrna, Salonica, or any other scale or port of our Empire, paying^ three per cent, custom, which being paid no person shall give to them that lade them any molestation or hinderance. IX. It being represented to us that the English have been accustomed hitherto to pay no custom nor mezan for any silk they bought in Smyrna (that of Brussa and Constantinople excepted), viz., for the silk of Giorgia, Persia, or Armenia, if really there is any such use and custom, and the thing is not of prejudice to the Empire, let there in Smyrna for the future be demanded neither custom nor mezan for the said silk, but to the English merchants let all kindness be used and shown, and the Ambassador having made instance to us, that the foregoing articles might be put into the capitulations, his request is granted, and con formably to the former imperial sign and capitulation, let now in con formity of what was passed and of my Imperial Command, be renewed and granted this present Imperial capitulation which we command, as long as Charles the Second, King of England (whose end may it terminate in happiness) maintains good friendship and correspondence with us accord ing to what has been maintained with our ancestors and to which we, on our part, are not wanting with all tenderness entertaining this friend ship. And we do swear and promise by him that has created the heaven and the earth, and the creatures; by the Creator, the one God, we do promise that nothing shall be done contrary to this our Imperial capi tulations, and accordingly every one is to obey our Imperial sign. Given in the middle of the moon Gemazil Akir 1086 in the Imperial city of Andrianople being in the month of September 1675. The Grand Signor writes above with his own hand as follows:— Let everything be observed in conformity to our Imperial Command and contrary to it let nothing be done. Appendix C. Whereas in the Imperial capitulations firmly subsisting between the Court of Great Britain and the Ottoman Porte, and more especially in the first, thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh Articles of the said capitula tions, it is expressed and stipulated that the English merchants and all under their banner may safely and freely trade and negotiate to and from the dominions of the Ottoman Porte, and throughout every part of those dominions by sea and by land, paying three aspers in the hundred tor custom and nothing more; and whereas in the year 1794 a tariff was formed to serve as a permanent rule by fixing the ^ums to be paid at the said rate for custom on all such merchandise as the said merchants[ xxiii ] might and should import from their own and other foreign countries into Turkey, and on such as they should export and carry from Turkey into their own and other foreign countries for sale; and whereas by reason of the increased prices of all commodities the duties levied according to this tariff having fallen much below 3 per cent, the Court of Great Britain in compliance with the desire of the Ottoman Porte and in conformity to the anxious wishes it feels for the prosperity of the Ottoman Empire did order a new tariff of customs to be constructed for the English merchants which was accordingly done in April 1800, fixing the rates of the standard of three in the hundred, according to the Imperial capitu lations ; and whereas His Excellency the Right Hon^ble Charles Arbuth- not. Member of His Britannic Majesty's Privy Council and His Ambas sador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at the Sublime Porte has represented that the rates of certain articles in this new English tariff are higher than those paid by other Christian powers, and has asked that an alteration should be made in conformity to the sacred capitulations which stipulate that equal privileges shall be enjoyed by England as are or shall be granted to the most favoured nations. In consequence whereof and in virtue of an Imperial Firman issued to that effect, the rates of certain articles have been reduced and fixed through the medium of Mr. Pisani, English Drogoman, and of the English merchants on the one stand and by His Excellency Hassan Aga, Head Customer, and one of the Imperial Chamberlaines on the other, and the list following in this book containing the rates and all that part of the tariff settled in 1800, which has not now been altered has been signed and sealed to serve as a permanent rule.

Treati/ between Great Britain and the Sublime Porte concluded at the Dardanelles on the bth of January 1809. In the name op the Most Merciful God. The object of this faithful and authentic instrument is as follows :— Notwithstanding the appearances of a misunderstanding between the Court of Great Britain and the Sublime Ottoman Porte, consequent upon the occurrences of the moment, the two powers, equally animated with a sincere desire of re-establishing- the ancient friendship which subsisted between them, have named their Plenipotentiaries for that purpose, that is to say. His Most August and Most Honored Majesty George the Third, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, has named for His Plenipotentiary Robert Adair, Esquire, one of the Members of the Royal Parliament of Great Britain; and His Majesty the Most Noble, Most Powerful, the Most Magnificent Sultan Mahomet Han II., Emperor of the Ottomans, has named for His Plenipotentiary Syud Mehmed Emin Vahid Effendi, Director and Inspector of the Department called ' Mercoufat,' and invested with the rank of ' Niehange^ of the Imperial Divan, who having reciprocally communicated to each other their full powers, after several conferences and discussions have con cluded the peace equally desired by both powers, and have agreed upon the following articles :— I. From the moment of signing the present Treaty every act of hosti lity between England and Turkey shall cease, and in furtherance of this happy peace, the prisoners on both sides shall be exchanged without dis tinction in thirty-one days from the signature of this Treaty, or sooner, if possible. II. Should any fortresses belonging to the Sublime Porte be in the pos session of Great Britain, they shall be restored to the Sublime Porte, and given up with all the cannons, warlike stores, and other effects in the condition in which they were found at the time of their being occupied by England, and this restitution shall be made in the space of thirty-one days from the signature of the present Treaty. III. Should there be any effects and property belonging to English mer chants under sequestration within the jurisdiction of the Sublime Porte, the same shall be entirely given up and restored to the proprietors, and in like manner, should there by any effects, property, and vessels belong- in to the merchants, subjects of the Sublime Porte, under sequestration at Malta, or in any other islands and possessions of His Britannic Majesty, they also shall be entirely given up and restored to their proprietors.xxvii IV. The Treaty o£ capitulations agreed upon in the Turkish year 1086 * tt j . j- (A.D. 1675)* in the middle of the i e ppen i\ , month Gemmaziel Akir, as also the Act relating- to the commerce of the Black Sea, and the other privileges (Imtia- zat) equally established by Acts at subsequent periods, shall continue to be observed and maintained as if they had suffered no interruption. V. In return for the indulgence and good treatment afforded by the Sublime Porte to English merchants with respect to their goods and property, as well as in all matters tending to facilitate their commerce, England shall reciprocally extend every indulgence and friendly treatment to the flag, subjects, and merchants of the Sublime Porte which may hereafter frequent the dominions of His Britannic Majesty for the purposes of commerce. VI. The last Custom House tariff established at Constantionople at the ancient rate of 3 per cent., and particularly the Article relating to the interior commerce, shall continue to be observed as they are at present regulated, and to which England promises to conform. VII. % Ambassadors from His Majesty the King of Great Britain shall enjoy all the honors enjoyed by Ambassadors to the Sublime Porte from other nations; and Ambassadors from the Sublime Porte at the Court of London shall reciprocally enjoy all the honors granted to the Ambassadors from Great Britain. VIII. Consuls (Shabenders) may be appointed at Malta and in the dominions of His Britannic Majesty, where it shall be necessary to manage and superintend the affairs and interests of merchants of the Sublime Porte, and similar privileges and immunities to those granted to English Consuls, resident in the Ottoman dominions, shall be duly afforded to the ' Shabenders ' of the Sublime Porte. IX. English Ambassadors and Consuls may supply themselves, according to custom, with such Dragomen as they shall stand in need of; but as it has already been mutually agreed upon that the Sublime Porte shall not grant the ' Barat' of Dragoman in favor of individuals who do not execute that duty in the place of their destination, it is settled, in confor mity with this principle, that in future the ' Barat' shall not be granted to any person of the class of tradesmen or bankers, nor to a shop-keeper or manufacturer in the public markets, or to one who is engaged in any matters of this description, nor shall English Consuls be named from among the subjects of the Sublime Porte.xxviii j X. English patents of protection shall not be granted to dependants or merchants who are subjects of the Sublime Porte, nor shall any passport be delivered to such persons on the part of Ambassadors or Consuls without permission previously obtained from the Sublime Porte. XL As ships of war have at all times been prohibited from entering the canal of Constantinople, viz., in the Straits of the Dardanelles and of the Black Sea, and as this ancient regulation of the Ottoman Empire is in future to be observed by every Power in time of peace, the Court of Great Britain promises on its part to conform to this principle. XII. The ratifications of the present Treaty of Peace between the high contracting parties shall be exchanged at Constantinople in the space of ninety-one days from the date of this Treaty, or sooner if possible. In faith of which, and in order that the ratification of the twelve Articles of this Treaty (which has been happily concluded by the assistance of god, and in the sincerity and good faith of the two parties) may be exchanged, I, Plenipotentiary of the Sublime Porte, have, in virtue of my full powers, signed and sealed this instrument, which I have delivered to the Pleni potentiary of His Britannic Majesty in exchange for another instrument exactly conformable thereto, written in the French language, with a translation thereof, which has been delivered to me on his part agreeably to his full powers.

(Sd.) Robert Ardair. (L .S.) Appendix E. Memorandum on the present condition of the Pachalic of Bagdad and the means it possesses of renovation and improvement. The extent of disorganization and depression which at present reigns in the Pachalic of Bagdad has rarely, if ever, been exceeded. Its popula tion has decreased almost beyond belief; its cultivation is more than proportionally diminished; its canals of irrigatiQn are daily suffered to choke up, and the lands they watered to run to waste, and its most fertile districts, which once were covered with villages and gardens and fields of grain, are abandoned to the Arab tribes, who were confined to the desert tracts around. Every source of revenue appears to be fast drying up, and a decay which threatens utter ruin seems approaching with rapid strides. The causes of this decay are to be found in the total incapacity and misgovernment of the present Pacha, who has neither strength toxxix restrain the encroachments of the numerous surrounding tribes, nor wisdom nor prudence sufficient to exercise with effect the small share of power yet left him, so as to conciliate his few remaining subjects, or raise the slender resources of a failing revenue. Plague and famine commenced the depopulation of his territories, tyranny and exaction, with a vicious system of Government and collection on his part, and a constant exposure to plunder by the Arab and Koordish tribes, from which he is unable to protect them, have driven from their homes into other countries the greater portion of those that remained, so that the villages are now untenanted and the land lies untilled. A short description of the Pachalic in its present condition, contrasted with alteration which a very moderate degree of firmness and wisdom and administration would infallibly produce, will best serve to illustrate and give emphasis to the above statement. The Pachalic of Bagdad extends in a direction nearly north-western and south-eastern from Mardeen to the Persian Gulf, a space of about 750 miles in length by a medium breadth of 800, and its boundaries may be thus described: a line from Mardeen drawn up through Upper Mesopotamia or at Jazeerah (as it is termed by the Arabs) to Kerkessia at the formation of the Khabour and Euphrates separates it on the west from the Pachalics of Arfa and Aleppo; again a line stretching from Mardeen to Arbeel, including Nisebun and Mensel, and thence to the Gerdain Mountains (called Karasadaeigh by the Turks and Joodee by the Arabs) running along their feet by Zolhab to Mendeelee, thence again skirting the mountains of Touristan to the lliver Kerkha or Karasa in Keezistan, following the course of that river to Hameeza, crossing the Chaab country to Dorak and touching the sea at Gobaitn will indicate its north-eastern boundary. The habitable country west of the Euphrates from Kerbesia to Meshed Allee, and from thence the canal of Pollacopas, affords a palpable line of demarkation on the south-west, but as in times of prosperity and strength the power of the Pacha extended over the Arab tribes that range to the westward of that line, the boundary of the Pachalic on this side may be considered as undefined. This extensive territory, comprising some of the most fertile country in the world, is by some divided into 26 districts, which may be separated into those lying on the Euphrates and those upon the Tigris. They are exhibited in the following list, where they stand nearly in geographical order from N. W. to S. E., and those which are at present productive to Government are marked to distinguish them from those that are not:— Euphrates. Tigris. Anah. Semanah. Mardeen. Tehreet. Rahheh. Soogu Shiook. Nisebun. Samevah. Hit. Bussorah. Monsel. Mendelee. Kerbelah. Erbeel. Yohal. Hillah. Kerkook. Jassan. Nujjup. Suleimaneeh. Bagdad Bedraee. Femloom. Kiew Saujak. Khesail. Dour. These districts are all governed by Pachas, Begs, Mussalleems, or Yabits appointed either by the Porte or Pacha, but the degree of obedienceXXX ] yielded by many of them to the existing loeal Government may be said to depend on its power of enforcing it, so that the political divi sions always vary with the strength of the reigning Pacha. At present it will be seen that of the 26 districts specified, not one-half yield any revenue whole, of the remaining ones, the obdience and income yielded is little more than nominal. At this period of feebleness and disorganiza tion, therefore, the above scheme of division is virtually multiplied, and the Pachalic may be described as thus occupied ;— 1. That portion of the country on the west of the Tigris from Mardeen to Kirkessia and along the course of the Kharbour and Hennas Rivers is entirely overrun by the Millee Koords, who everywhere oppress the inhabitants and have entirely put a stop to the passage of caravans by that route from Alleppo to Bagdad, which was formerly preferred to the desert one by Anah and Hit. These Millee Koords under their leader, Eyooh Aga, extend their ravages quite up to Beer on the Euphrates. The Yezeedees of Sin jar until lately have disturbed this district, but Maho med, late Pacha of Alleppo, the seat of whose government is at Kirkook, lately reduced them to temporary obedience. He has, however, just been recalled towards Bagdad, and the road will of course become again infested by the Yezeedees. No caravan can pass, and no revenue can possibly be derived from this district. 2. The whole of the lezereh or Mesopotamia from the line of the Khabour to Bagdad is in a similar manner overrun by the Terbah Arabs, except in the vicinity of Bagdad, which is infested by the Arab tribe of Delaim. This district is, therefore, in the same condition as the last, and pays nothing. 3. A small part of the lezereh embracing the western half of the city of Bagdad, and between the lines of Teheja, Bagdad, Seleucia, and Hillahris to a certain extent cultivated and productive, and the income derived from it forms a large item in the present revenue of the Pachalic. 4. From the small district last described to the Shat-ul-Hye the country is entirely in the hands of various tribes of Arabs, the domi nant tribe being the Zobeid who pqy nothing in cash to Government, the military and other service they are nominally bound to render being held in lieu of money tribute : thus this district pays nothing. 5. From the lines of the Shat-ul-Hye to Kooma the country is occupied by many tribes of Arabs, of whom the Beni Rubbeyah, mater nal uncles of the Montifick, are the principal; anything they may occasion ally pay to Goverment is included in what is given by the Montificks, so that this great district cannot, properly speaking, be said to yield any money revenue at all. 6. Returning to Mardeen, the country east of the Tigris, from thence and from Amadia between the river and the Gardian Mountains to the line of Zohab, Khanaher, and Bakowbah is wholly occupied and plundered by a multitude of petty Koordish and Arab tribes, each residing separately in their own villages and strongholds, or in the grounds they have appropriated for pasturage, none being permanently predominant, but all offering as much resistance as possible to the ordersxxxi or exactions of Government, and, as it appears by the foreg-oing- list, the greater number with sueess, accordingly but a trifling' income is derived from this large tract of country. 7. There are to the south-east of the last mentioned division some small districts in the neighbourhood of Mendelee, which, when not plundered and laid waste by the Persian troops and freebooters, return a considerable revenue; but these excepted, the whole tract from that line between the Soo Mountains and the Tigris as far as the River Kerkha or Karasee is occupied by the field tribes of Sooristan and the large Arab one of Ben-i-sam, the former keeping to the high grounds, the latter ranging the plain. This district therefore yields nothing to Gov ernment. 8. From the Kerkha to the sea being that part of Khazistan, included in the Pachalic, is entirely occupied by the Chaab Arabs, who pay nothing to Government. 9. Returning once more to the north-west and taking the line of the Euphrates the whole country to the west of that river, and indeed from the vicinity of Alleppo all the way to Hullah is undisputedly pos sessed by the very numerous and powerful tribe of Anezah Arabs, who range the desert to an unknown extent beyond, and to whom all minor tribes yield implicit submission. They have lately shown their power in a very alarming way, and yield of course neither revenue nor obedience and thus exhaust the country, so that nothing can be obtained from it. 10. From Alllah to Sernavah the country is marshy from the over flow of the Euphrates in consequence of the breaking of its bunds, and this tract, including what are known as the Lemloom marshes, is held by the large tribe of Khezal Arabs, who are principally cultivators, or who feed large flocks of buffaloes in the marshes, and do not wander beyond them. In this tract there are several towns which are independent of the Arabs, and which pay considerable sums to Government: these form a part of the revenue of the Shamerah (as the lands westward of the Euphrates are termed by the Arabs)) and make a considerable item in the Government income. The Khezail themselves pay nothing. 11. From Semavah to the sea is occupied by the Montifick Arabs, and includes a number of petty tribes dependent upon them. These are for the present obedient, and have lately paid some money to Govern ment, but their obedience cannot be relied upon for any definite period. 12. Bussorah city and immediate environs may be considered as forming another and concluding district, which contributes also largely but to the Pacha^s resources. Such being the mode in which the Pachalic is at present occupied, the accompanying Statement will serve to convey a tolerably correct idea of the amount and nature of the revenue actually now derived from it. In collecting information from native sources absolute accuracy is rarely to be obtained, and the obstacles met with in such a pursuit independent of the indolence and indifference of those who must be the agents, forbid both rapid progress and often ultimate precision, but it is confidently believed that the Statement now referred to is sufficiently accurate for the purpose it is intended to serve.[ xxxii ] From this Statement it appears that the amount of revenue, which even in the present ruined condition of the Pachalic reaches the Treasury, does not fall short of Raij Piasters 83,4912,000 or about £208,500 Ster ling, and this not only after being subjected to the most sweeping- and shameless system of peculation and fraud in collection, but after the abstraction of an acknowledged sum of Raij Piasters 17,315,000, or about £43,200 sterling paid in Pumlak or assignment of land in lieu of salary to public officers and other annuitants. The causes of this enormous reduction from the revenues of former times and of the melancholy condition of this once rich and fertile province are to be sought for alone in the total incapacity of its ruler, and the vicious as well as inefficient nature of his Government. A short sketch of the characters of both will assist in establishing this fact and in illustrating the means of restoring the country to its natural produc tiveness and prosperity. Ali, the present Pacha, formerly Governor of Alleppo, and successor of Daood Pacha at Bagdad, is about 50 yeai-s of age, of weak mind, and feeble judgment, and so irresolute of purpose that neither his promises nor commands can safely be deemed binding for an hour together. He is selfish and indolent in the extreme, of gross appetites, and low propensities, exceedingly avaricious and quite regardless of the nature of the means by which money may be acquired. He is not naturally inclined either to cruelty or injustice, but so intolerant of trouble or the fatigue of business that he will sanction or overlook almost any crime committed by his servants rather than submit to have his case disturbed by investigation, and thus justice is virtually denied to the injured party. In point of moral courage and decision, he is equally deficient, so that he is quite unequal to act in the critical situations he is frequently placed in, and which require a firmness and vigour of mind, of which he is utterly devoid. The principal redeeming points in his character appear to be a good natured and easy affability, and a degree of literary taste and acquirements which would have fitted him rather for the quiet seclusion of private life than for the bustling scene on which he has been thrown. Unhappily the Pacha^s deficiencies are by no means compensated by the talents or integrity of his servants. There is not in fact a single person about him qualified to aid his master or benefit the public. His Khayah is said to be a well-meaning man, but he is scarcely better quali fied for business than his superior, and the only person of the smallest ability about the Seray is the Geemrookehee or Custom Master, an officer who has acquired a great and unaccountable influence over the Pacha, but who unfortunately is still more remarkable for dishonesty than for talent. The few of his former officers, who might have laid claim to better report, were carried off by the plague or by assassination; those of his predecessors, who might yet be useful, remaitf unemployed from motives of policy and caution, and the whole of his existing establish ment, both public and private, is contemptible and mean in the extreme. An attempt to develope the whole system of fraud and peculation which pervades every department of Government would be equally dis gusting and unnecessary. A few instances will suffice to point out how materially the revenues of the Pachalic arc affected by it.xxxiii The Goomrook or customs are not farmed; they are collected and paid into the Treasury by the Custom Master at stated periods, and as a specimen of the fidelity with which this trust is executed, it has been ascertained that of 70 lakhs of Raij Piasters received as custom from the last caravan from Damascus, 30 only were accounted for to Government. If to this rate of peculation be added the amount received from mer chants in compromise of valuation of their j^oods, some idea may be formed of that in which Government stands defrauded in this branch of revenue alone. In like manner, the Mogaatch, or farm of trades, is subject to the same excessive abuse : all sellers of the articles of food are not only obliged to purchase from the Pacha their share of the monopoly main tained in such articles, but are forced to supply all persons of the Court and their dependents and servants gratis with the articles in which they deal. Under a regular system of Government this kind of revenue should probably be done away, in the mean time it is one subject to the most scandalous abuses. The abuses and frauds in the Mint or SeciaerJchana are not less exces sive, the coinage is reduced almost to a valueless currency. In coining the 10 Piaster pieces, which are made of an alloy of copper and silver, one- third of the latter is allowed by, and charged to. Government, but scarcely one-ninth is actually employed in the coinage. A similar degree of fraud is practised in collecting the Teem or stamp duty, and in the management of the Auguf or income from lands formerly appropriated to the support of religious institutions. The mode of selling Government lands, whether in single villages or districts, appears, and in itself is, as fair as possible. The subject to be let is put to public sale, and the best bidder gets the farm, the Pacha himself being quicksighted enough to his own interest to insist on full time being given for all offers to be received. The evils connected with this method are not in the collection of the lawful revenue, but in the extraordinary and very grievous burdens imposed either by the Pacha himself or by his Lieutenants of districts—such as Soorsaut or provision for the passage of troops, unjust fines for disputes with neighbours, presents for good-will, &amp;c., and all this results upon the ryot, who is ground by the farmer till he breaks and runs away, and thus a rapid depo pulation of the country takes place. But there is yet a more wasteful and nefarious employment of Gov ernment land to be noticed. It will be observed that a very large amount of the revenues, described as derived from land, is in fact alienated in the shape of assignment in Tumleek, or in lieu of payment for salaries and allowances to officers of Government. These villages and districts are not only made over to occupiers on a false representation of their value, but at rates scarcely one-fourth part of their real worth ; but being, like the Government lands, subjected to the same grinding system of farming, whether by the assignee himself or by middle men, all attempts at improvement are frustrated, and the land gradually deteriorates and runs to waste. As one instance of the amount to which Government is defrauded by the TiuuLeek system, it may be mentioned that the Zoobcd Sheckh, e[ xxxiv merely for preserving 1 tranquillity in the larg-e country he oeeupies, receives in Tumleek districts valued at near 30 lakhs of Piasters, and which are in fact worth three times the money; in like manner, the Ayeil Sheikh receives 10 lakhs, but virtually what costs the Govern ment 30 lakhs. To proceed with this picture of misgovernment of 8,000 horse, Albanians and others, born upon the duftur of the Pachalic as effective troops, and for whom their officers regularly draw full pay and rations, scarcely one-third are extant, and these for want of disci- pline and leaders are nearly inefficient. In fact they can be considered as scarcely less dangerous to Government than to the enemy, nor can much more be said in favour of the Nizam or regular troops, of whom there are only about 400 or 500 in the Pachalic, while on the contingents, which should be furnished by Arab and Koordish tribes, no dependence whatever can be placed. Unable therefore to protect the country or to control the freebooters by which it is overrun and the capital threatened by any forces of his own, the Pacha finds himself obliged to have recourse to the very dangerous system of calling in one tribe to oppose another. The natural consequence of this has been that all of them have become friends and enemies in their turn, and all in their turn have encroached more or less upon the best lands of the Pachalic until none in fact re main to it save the district immediately connected with the cities of Bagdad and Bussorah. A glance at the events of the last few years will illustrate the effects of the system and serve also to give an idea of the immediate condition of the Pachalic. About three years ago the powerful tribe of Jerbah, a branch of the Shummer, who, in consequence of one of these forced concessions had been settled in the rich district of the Dijail and the lower part of the Jezeerah, became as usual troublesome and clamorous for a further extent of land. Their demands being rejected by Government they threatened to enforce them, and the Pacha, with the view of weakening their power by creating internal divisions, appointed, as their Sheikh, a young man named Shulash in lieu of Suffook } their former Chief, now a rebel to his authority, and the former was duly installed along with the portion of the tribe which adhered to him in the lands of the Dijail, till then held by the whole. Suffook on this retired with the principal part of the tribes to Upper Mesopotamia, where he ravaged the country, stopping the roads, and plundering all caravans, and took part with Yehia Pacha of Monsul, then lying under the displeasure of Government. In the following 1 year Yehia Pacha having been deposed and Suffook himslf having-been parti cularly exasperated by certain measures of this Government. He came down from the upper districts and, as is well known, invested Bagdad itself and plundered the country around it without suffering the smallest in terruption from Government. It was in fact incapable of offering any resistance, and the new Sheikh Shulash, unable to show front to the stronger branch of his tribe, had retired to a safe distance. After a blockade of about two months, however, the Arabs suddenly broke up their camp and went their way; no cause could be assigned forXXXV their retreat; it certainly proceeded from no active measures on the part of the Pacha, and is probably attributable only to that restless spirit which pervades all irregular and uncombined armies of Arabs in parti cular and renders it impossible fri keep them long together. Pasturage was probably falling short, plunder was exhausted, they were weaiy and disgusted, and away they went, and Bagdad was once more free. Suft'ook retired to his old haunts in the upper Pachalic to plunder and infest the roads again and threaten another descent this year. Shulash on hearing this threat declared to the Pacha his inability to face his rival without assistance, and the Pacha terrified at the possibility of a repetition of the last yearns scene, sent to demand assistance from the Anezah, a very large and powerful tribe of Arabs that occupy the western bank of the Eu phrates, from to Hillcik, promising them ample compensation and the lands of the tribe they were invited to turn out. Allured by these promises the Anezah obeyed the summons and brought, it is said, upwards of 30,000 fighting men to the vicinity of Bagdad. In the meantime, however, SufPook, either mistrustful of his tribe, or from some other unknown cause, gave up his threatened visit and retreated further into the upper districts, where he now continues, and the Pacha freed from this cause of alarm sent to inform the Anezah that their services were no longer required, and that they refused to do, and called upon the Pacha to perform his portion of the agreement as they had or were willing to do theirs. They demanded too the pro mised lands, and at the same time made a proposal to take charge of the whole Shamieh or lands west of the Euphrates, and maintain them in a state of tranquillity upon a lease, the terms of which were most unfavourable to Government. These demands and proposals were alike rejected by the Pacha, who now called upon Salas/i to bring his Jerbas to aid the troops of the Pachalic in turning out the Anezah by force. The result was an engage ment which took place about a month ago, in which the Jerbas were totally defeated and dispersed, and the Pacha's troops were only saved from a like fate by the forbearance of the Anezah, who from a lingering degree of respect spared the troops of Government and turned all their vengeance on the Arab allies; since then the Anezah have virtually held the City of Bagdad in blockade, at least upon its western side, and all the roads have been covered by marauding parties either of them or of their banditti, who in their name plunder all caravans and rob and strip all passengers they can lay hold of. In this system of pillage it appears that another tribe of Arabs were found to be deeply and treacherously involved. It would be tedious to explain by what means a branch of the Agail, a great tribe inhabiting the Nejcl, became the sole guardians and carriers of all caravans from Damascus and Aleppo to Bagdad; it is sufficient to say that this mono poly originated in a transaction closely resembling those we are describ ing and has continued for several years. It has been the custom of this tribe to send every now and then a party of some thousands to reside at Bagdad in order to supply the demand for guides and to watch over their own interests, but until two years ago they were never permitted to reside within the city; taking advantage of the Pacha's weakness, and their having in their power a large caravan, of which they were the' xxxvi pledged guardians, and which they had already conducted to the close vicinity of the place, they threatened, unless he consented to admit them as residents within its walls, to plunder and carry off the kafilah. The Pacha, unable to protect it, consented; they were established in the western half of the city, and have ever since that time become its absolute masters, admitting there only such persons as they pleased, and protest ing against the arm of Government or the operation of the law; all vagabonds and evil-doers sought refuge there, in so much that no person of respectability would any longer live in that quarter. The Pacha exasperated at this defiance of his authority within his own capital, resolved to embrace the first opportunity for turning out the Agail, and the plunder of some of his own officers in the close vicinity of the city which was traced to these Arabs. His Highness, to an extraordinary effort of decision, ordered the whole of them at once to quit the place peaceably on pain of being expelled by force; with this command Agail Chief refused to comply unless he should receive from the Pacha a pledge of security from attack on the part of His Highness or his allies after leaving the gates. This pledge it appears did not suit the views of the Pacha to grant. He had previously sent for the Sheikh of the Zobude, another tribe of lower Mesopotamia, to come to his assistance, and for another person, named Saleymaun Ghaunam, who is an enemy of the Agails, and who has collected some followers of various tribes around him. The Agail Sheikh alarmed at the Pacha^s refusal went himself to the serai to remonstrate; a report spread that he had been put to death, his tribe flew to arms, cut the bridge of boats that unites the two of the town and dividing into two parties the one commenced a fire against the eastern half of the city, while the other rushed out to seize the guns of the Pacha's troops, who were encamped without tbe walls. The Pacha no doubt alarmed at the firing and uproar gave the Sheikh a dress and dismissed him to quiet his tribe, but at the same time by a boat sent private orders to the Kahayah (who commanded the troops). His messenger found the Kahayah already engaged; the Arabs had made so sudden a charge that one of the guns was in their possession before the troops knew that they were enemies. They then flew to oppose them, fired the remaining cannon at the Arabs, drove them back and recovered the lost gun. A regular engagement now took place, in the course of which the Arabs retreated towards the town, followed by the Nizam and Albanians, who entered it with them pell mell by the Hillah gate : within this there is an open space where the contest was main tained for several hours, the Arabs taking post behind walls and in the houses around, while the troops fired at them with cannon and musketry. The issue was doubtful till a fresh supply of troops and ammunition pushed across the river in a boat gave fresh spirit to their comrades and the Arabs forced to retreat. At that critical time a body of Albanians, who had been firing across the river at the Arabs that still showed face against the city, made a rush along the broken bridge keeping up a hot fire, and continuing to reunite the two parts pushed across. Thexxxvii ] Arabs, finding themselves thus between two fires, panic struck fled on all * Sic in or sides and shut themselves up, arms in hand, in their houses till morning', when they quitted the city in their.* The western half o£ the city, being thus in fact taken by storm, was completely plundered by the soldiery. The bazars were quitted and set fire to, every house broken open, and man and woman indiscrimi nately stript of everything. Not a few were put wantonly to death, and all the painful consequences of such an event caused. The remain ing inhabitants fled across the river from their plundered dwellings and from the excited soldiery, and that half of the city is a desert of ruins. Such is the present state of Bagdad, innocent and guilty suffered alike, indeed the former were worst off, for the Agail, the authors of the mischief, have escaped with comparatively little loss, but all alike . . . curse the feeble vet tvrannical.t This + fern on,. feel . ng ^ ^ ^ ^ several appeals were made to our party as it passed through the scene of action or the succeeding, that nothing was now left them but to throw themselves on the protection of those of another faith since those of their own had lost sight of justice and mercy. The Agail fled, part, it is said, to the Anezah, part to Jerbah, entreat ing for assistance to regain their lost position. But the Anezah have refused to interfere, and we learn, moreover, that disunion is prevailing among them probably from the same causes as those that dissolved the confederacy of the Jerbah—deficiency of pasturage and discontent at short success, so that hopes are entertained that Bagdad may in no long time be freed from its present blockade. In the mean time Salymaun Ghunnam and the Zobeid Sheik have arrived when their services, like those of the Anezah, had been rendered unnecessary by the unusual success of the troops. It remains to be seen how the Pacha will settle with them; but as their power is comparatively small, the consequences of disap pointing them will be less perplexing than the former. It must be obvious that with such a Government can be contemp lated no good circumstances of the Pachalic; on the contrary, unless some change is speedy, what can be anticipated but the total loss of the Pachalic to the Porte, and its passing into the complete and acknow ledged possession of the Arab tribes, who may even now be considered as its actual owners. It is indeed most surprizing that a consummation so apparently inevitable should have been so long delayed, but it would seem as if a fall still hung around the ruined image of that power, which the wild and roving Arab once beheld with reverence as the most august on earth, both in a religious and political point of view, and which he still hesi tates to violate. This is something too moderate to be attributed to the influence of Bedouin habits which are strongly opposed to a resi dence in towns. They never (except in the case of the Agail) enter Bagdad willingly, and seldom pass a night within its walls. But the force of those influences is fast decreasing; like tribes of Arabs have long been hovering round the city and seat of Government, approachingxxxviii ] nearer at every, while a large portion are already in the transition state from pastoral to agricultural habits, and respect cannot long continue to be entertained, for a pageant in itself is utterly powerless and despicable. If therefore the policy of Great Britain embraces any views, whether of a political, commercial, or agricultural nature, connected with this country, it must be obvious that a change must be effected in the Government here if she would not see her undertakings, of whatever kind, even the establishment of steam-boats on the Euphrates, termi nate in disappointment and loss. An attempt shall now be made to show what change on the face of the Pachalic might be effected by a Government possessed of firm ness and stability, and acting on principles of moderation and justice and liberality, and opposed to violence, venality, and fraud. On the succession of Soleyman Pacha to the Vizierat in 177, the condition of the Pachalic was much what it is at present. It was overrun by Arab tribes; its agriculture was destroyed or abandoned; and the city of Bagdad, deserted by its merchants and its commerce, was almost destitute of revenue or resources. Soleyman, while commanding the troops of his master, Ahmed Pacha, had however gained a name for courage and vigor of action among the Arabs, and he maintained it well on his accession to the Vizierat. But the just thing to do was to restore the failing revenues of the Pachalic. He promised protection to the Fellahs and encouraged them to re-occupy their deserted villages, and inviting merchants from all quarters to repeople the bazars; he lent them his own money, free of interest, to trade upon. The effect was magical. In a few years a desolate waste was transformed into a smiling and pro ductive country, and the bazars of Bagdad teemed with the commodities of every foreign land, the lawful duties upon which amply repaid his first outlay. A like result, though not to an equal extent, justified the policy and rewarded the Vizier of Daood Pacha's administration. He awed and controlled the Arab tribes, and though he ground the ryots, he encour aged agriculture by digging and reopening canals, while commerce in particular flourished under his auspices, and his revenue became large and increasing. Unfortunately for himself, he listened rather to the flat teries and misrepresentations of his servants than to the disinterested and sound advice offered him by the English Resident. But he saw his error and acknowledged it, and but for his overthrow, which was effected by the hand of the Almighty alone, and not by any other power of the Porte, he would have redeemed the mistake, and we should now in all probability have seen the resources of the Pachalic expanding under a liberal system of improvement and British influence, and filling and spreading gradually abroad, while a wild field would have been opened to British capital and genius. But that is now passed, and it remains to examine what might still be done, what would even be the immediate effect of a change in the nature of the Government of this Pachalic. Such a measure would by necessity involve a complete change of every person now employed under the present Government, nor would there be any difficulty in obtaining a supply of able and honest men to[ xxxix ] take charg-e of the revenue departments and replace those now in office, who, iu addition to their other disqualihcations, are strangers for the most part to Bagdad and unacquainted with the nature and forms of business here. With such a set of officers under a suitable system of checks it is not too much to say that the revenues derived from the town itself would instantly be more than doubled, and a similar arrangement at Bussorah would produce like results. Another salutary consequence of such a change of officers would be the power of doing away at once with the iniquitous system of Tumleek payment of salaries, and thereby throwing into the hands of Govern ment a vast additional mass of lands and villages which under suitable guarantee would let for at least three times their present estimated value: all salaries and allowances should be paid in cash. The next measures to be adopted would naturally be those for en couraging agriculture and the re-occupation of abandoned villages, were it made publicly known that all persons desirous of renting lands should apply directly to Government, and not through subordinate officers; that no presents should either be demanded or received; and that the rent agreed upon should positively cover all demands upon the farmer, while he in his turn should be forced, not only to fulfill his engagements with Government, but to deal justly with his Fellahs; and were the good faith of this proelamation confirmed by a year's experience, it is difficult to calculate the increase which would accrue to the revenue in probably two years. The returns of the villages already in operation would be enor mously augmented, while Fellahs, now unemployed, and the cultivating Arabs would press in crowds to take possession of those that are at present abandoned in despair at the exactions to which their late inhabi tants were exposed. Such an arrangement would, however, necessarily involve, not only a promise of, but actual and efficient protection to, the cultivators from plunder and robbery by the incursions of predatory tribes; nor would this be a measure so difficult of accomplishment as the actual state of the Pachalic might lead us to imagine. A certain number of effective, trustworthy, and disposable troops would undoubtedly be requisite, but it is not too much to say that were all that are now borne on the duftur of the Pachalic actually present and rendered effective by proper disci pline and active and experienced officers, they would be nearly, if not quite, equal to all emergencies. The forces of Daood Pacha, those at least in regular pay, and which proved sufficient for such purposes, did not exceed 3,000 cavalry and perhaps 5,000 infantry with a fair detail of artillery. But doubtless at first, and until the troops of the Govern ment should have been reduced to proper discipline and have gained that self-confidence which is requisite to render any troops effieient, it would be desirable to support the power of the authorities by the presence of a well organized force of a few thousand men supplied with all the requi sites of war. These would keep the Arabs in check, and the Fellahs themselves gaining confidence from this support would soon learn to turn out in defence of their property. Once warned of the consequences of unlawful practices, and checked, if needful, by a sharp example, the Arabs would become sensible of their[ xl ] weakness and cease to trouble tbe districts nearest home, and with them would disappear the bands of petty plunderers who follow in the rear of the great tribes and beset the roads under cover of their names. But the operation of this system is by no means to be contemplated as confined to the Arabs close at hand. Its principle would infallibly extend to all the tribes which at present inhabit Mesopotamia and the cultivable districts in its vicinity, forcing- them to become peaceable cultivators of the soil, or to retire into the further deserts whence they originally came. Already have the advantages of a fixed home and culti vated lands become so apparent to, and appreciated by, the Arabs of all the large tribes that, in spite of their prejudice against the occupation of itself, it has become their great object to possess themselves of such lands, and rather than forego the comforts of such acquisitions and sub mit to be driven from these fixed abodes, they would undoubtedly consent to settle down in them as regular agriculturalists and to pay a rent accordingly; the progress of this process has already been made manifest by several examples, although the weakness of the Turkish Government and its rapacity in collecting has sadly retarded, and in many cases put a stop to, it altogether. Nor let it be imagined that an undue facility for carrying these pro jects into effect is here assumed. That the Arabs would at first unwil lingly submit to control is granted, but that they could offer no formid able or available resistance to a well organized system of expulsion from Mesopotamia is equally certain. In all cases, where they have been opposed with energy, they have invariably fled from the contest. They are only formidable in their own deserts, and to travellers or caravans too weak to offer resistance even in their quarrels with each other; their affairs are seldom bloody, and in every instance where Europeans, even in the smallest numbers, have been the objects of attack, they have receded and fled in consternation from their discipline and resolution. Thus a sense of the superiority of a well conducted and properly disciplined force, directed by a firm and well organized Government, would infallibly drive them from the abodes of civilized men or free them to become such themselves. No reasonable doubt can, therefore, be entertained that an almost unlimited supply of labourers will, under proper management, be obtained to improve the resources of the Pachalic. Were Mesopotamia tranquil, were its inhabitants made to feel the blessings of security to person and to property, were it, in short, to receive the boon of a just and firm Gov ernment, speedily indeed would it be repeopled. Thousands and hundreds of thousands would flow in from the surrounding and other less happy countries, and the rulers of these would be forced to treat their remain ing subjects mildly to avoid an utter depopulation of their territories. Let us look a little therefore more closely into the nature of these revenues. The fertility of Mesopotamia, especially of its lower alluvial portion, has never been matter of question. It produces all the grains of Lurope in abundance, together with rice, maize, sugar, cotton, indigo, mulberry for silk, and every sort of fruit in profusion. All that is required to call its fertility into action is water, and the remains of ancient canals, with which[ xli ] its whole surface is furrowed, prove not only the pains taken of old to secure an ample supply of that necessary from the great rivers that bound the province, but the success by which these effects were attended. Misfor tune and misrule have indeed made useless many of these great works of the ancient time, and they have consequently gone partially to ruin ; but such is the solidity of their structure and the nature of the country they were formed to irrigate, that most of them might be renewed at comparatively little cost, and would render cultivable so extensive a tract as, under a fixed Government, would very speedily repay with immense interest the outlay, whether private or public, of the work. Without an accurate map of the country it would be difficult to convey an idea of the extensive system of irrigation which it exhibits; some portion of it may, however, be readily comprehended by inspection of the common maps. In addition to the two great rivers, the Euphrates and Tigris, from the banks of which only a narrow slip of land could be watered, there were of old two great canals formed which, running nearly parallel to, but at a convenient distance from, their course, and being derived from points on these rivers so far above as to permit of the waters being conducted upon a level with the country they were intended to irrigate, were capable of watering an immense tract of land. These two canals were the Pallacopas and the Naharwan. The Pallacopas, taking its rise from a point on the Euphrates near ancient Babylon, maintained a course west of, but nearly parallel to, the Euphrates till it was lost near the sea below Bussorah. The Naharwan, a still more extensive work, derived its supply of water from the Tigris by other sources near Shamerak, and holding a course at various distances from that river crossed and obscured the waters of the Athem or ancient Lyens, those of the Diala which now enters the Tigris below Bagdad, and those of the Heed or Choaspie of antiquity still further below, till after a course of more than 350 miles it joined the Kerkha or Karosa in Khazistan, the ancient Susiana. From this immense canal, which is as broad as the Tigris itself, was derived a system of minor water-courses which can even yet be traced through a country, the greatest part of which is now utterly abandoned to the Arabs. Nor were there wanting canals of junction to unite the two princi pal streams. From Felugia, 25 miles west of Bagdad, upon the Euphrates, is derived the Nahr Ism, which crossed the country and entered the Tigris an hour above Bagdad, and at distances of from six to eight miles between successively are to be traced the Nahr of Serrer Mullick and Kootha, besides many of lesser note, all of which, though now dry, might, if required, be rendered efficient by a little labor. In like manner, on the eastern side of the Jezeereh, we find the Dijail canal, derived from the right bank of the Tigris some miles below Samarah and flowing parallel with that river or within 25 miles of Bagdad, while on either side of the Athem are discovered the Nahr But and Nahr Bath wan, both now dry, but each commanding a large and fertile district. These are but a few of the numerous engines of irriga tion which this country exhibits, and all in the vicinity of Bagdad.[ xlii ] Modern research has not yet been able to trace the extent of those, the mouths of which are still visible on the east bank of the Tigris and in Susiana, nor to explore those which doubtless do exist in the extensive tracts from Hillak or Selennia to the Eye, and from thence to Koorna. The value, however, of what has been lost, as well as of that which remains as yet unknown, may be estimated by the fractions with which we are acquainted. The whole agricultural produce of Mesopotamia at present may be considered as being' derived from the operation of the following eight canals which are themselves in but very partial use:— 1. The Boo Ghuraib, which deriving from below Felugia joins the marshes of Bagdad. 2. The Massoodee, which derives from a swamp fed by the Euphrates and joins the Tigris too below the former. 3. The Davodee (cut by Daood Pacha), which joins these two last canals. 4. The Kithwannieh, which derives from the Euphrates south west of Bagdad and joins the Tigris below the Masoodee. 5. The Mahmoodee, which derives from the Euphrates and flows towards Seleucia, but is lost in irrigation. There are a few smaller cuts between this last and the town of Hil- lah, but they water comparatively little ground. 6. The Khalis in Assyria, on the east of the Tigris, which derives from the right shore of the Diala and runs nearly 70 miles with a wind ing but south-westerly course that brings it within 20 miles of Bagdad. 7. The Khoraisan, which is derived from the opposite side of the Diala, and has nearly an equal course with the last in a south-easterly direction. 8. The Dejail, an ancient canal, almost choked up and in the hands of the Jerbak Arabs, but under all these disadvantages it is let on farm for about 13 lakhs of Piasters or about £3,500 a year. Its derivation and course are mentioned above. These modern canals, with the exception of the Khalis and Khorai san, are works of inferior extent and importance to the ancient ones, and even these, it may be safely stated, since the plague and inundation of 1831, and in consequence of the tyrannous rapacity of the Government and its inability to protect its Fellahs from pillage, are upon an average scarcely one-tenth part in operation. From this fact, which may be relied on, some idea may be formed of agricultural capability for production of this Pachalic. It is also worthy of observation that the modern canals differ mate rially from the ancient ones in this respect: that whereas the latter were formed by banks raised above the level of the country to be irrigated, so that their bottoms were on a level with its surface, the former were cuts in the soil forming some running brooks sunk beneath the surface. The consequence(toe [ xliii ] of this is, that while a cut or a sluice from the side of the ancient canals served without labour to disperse its waters over a wide tract of land, those of the modern canals require in most instances to be raised from their channel by wheels and bullocks for that purpose, and the quantity irrigated must therefore be greatly less. But it is not in agriculture alone that the Pachalic of Bagdad has suf- ered deterioration, but also from the feebleness and misrule of its Governors. Commerce is not less affected, and would, if steadily protected and encour aged, experience at least an equal degree of augmentation and productive ness. It is a fact worthy of notice that of all the roads which lead to Bagdad there is not at this moment one which can be pronounced passable for small parties of travellers, if we except that by water from the Gulf by Bussorah, and even that is subject to heavy exactions from the Arabs on the river bank. The routes from Aleppo and Damascus by Diarheker, Mardeen, and Mousel is utterly impassable, as is that from Constantinople, by any force less than that of an army. On the side of Persia, when there is either a disturbance in that country or an Arab tribe in rebellion here, the petty border tribes rise up to plunder, putting the fault, if discovered, upon the contending parties and the roads become shut up. Indeed, there are now only two to that country, as the whole of Khuzistan has been rendered impracticable by the tribes of Lour Feilee and Beni Sam. A country which is almost devoid of population, whose wants are so few as to be supplied from their own resources, and which at present has little or no produce to export, must necessarily have but little commerce. But ought this description to apply to Mesoptamia, once the richest country in the world, or to Bagdad, once not only the entrepot, but the consumer of the rarest and most valuable commodities of all quarters of the world. Even at this period of depression the caravans, which only, in consequence of the dangers of the road, come so seldom from Damascus and Aleppo, convey to the city European produce to the amount of at least £250,000 Sterling a year, or from 30 to 40 lakhs of rupees. The trade with Persia also is very considerable, and if we would form an estimate of how rapidly a trade with these countries may advance, let us only look to that of Trebizond, a post so lately opened, and the roads to which are also beset with banditti, yet the amount of European manufactures imported there within the last 12 months is estimated at a million sterling, and this only for the supply of the districts in its immediate vicinity and that of Erzroom (all sadly depopulated), and for that of the neighbouring provinces of Persia. It has already been shown that there would be no want of labourers were protection to be given to agriculture. It follows that there would soon be no want of consumers of the goods which commerce might import. Plague and tyranny have swept away or driven off the population, but there is a plentilul supply in the neighbourhood which will rush in to fill the vacuum as soon as encouragement of security shall have opened the way. Amadia, the late conquest of the Beg of Rewandooz, is said by the people of the country to contain 12,000 villages, having most of them not less than 100 families each. This is[ xliv ] doubtless an enormous exaggeration^ but it proves the eountry to be populous, a fact corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Ross, who went through a part of it and found it studded thickly with villages. There will be no want of consumers when the country becomes tranquil and secure. It were superfluous to expatiate on the field which such a change of system would open to industry and skill and capital in Mesopotamia, a region assuredly the most favorable in all respects, in climate, in soil, and in comparative proximity to all the seats of civilization and improvement in the old world, for the employment of these to advantage, even the rapid advance of Egypt in apparent prosperity, affords no fair scale to calculate the extent of improvement that might be expected here for Mohmed Alice Pacha, though to a certain extent liberal and enlightened in his views, looks ultimately to self. His country is exhausted, his people impoverished, and his power and course of improvement will probably terminate with himself, deepening the gloom of confusion that must follow like a bright light suddenly extinguished, and such has been, and such will be, the fate of the country if left to Native Government alone. Gleams of improvement there doubtless may be, but they will be imperfect and transitory like those which have preceded them. If, there fore, the prominent improvement and tranquillity of this province be an object of importance to Great Britain, let what will be the form of Government to be established, let the nature and extent of its future connection with the Court of Constantinople be what it may, she must and will find herself forced to maintain in that Government a permanent influence ; in fact, she must herself have the managing and directing of all measures of policy and improvement, let whoever or whatsoever be the organ for carrying them into effect.

(Sd.) J. B. Feasee.[ xlviii It must be held in recollection that the increase here exhibited upon the revenue is merely calculated on the districts and canals already in partial use as that which would be the almost immediate consequence of the presumed improvement in the Government of this country, and inviting the royals or Fellahs to re-occupy what has but lately been abandoned, first from the effects of plague, and next from the exactions of the existing Government. No expense to Government is here contem plated, and no cutting or cleaning out the canals, although the advantage and experience of such work would soon force themselves on the attention of Government, and the increase of revenue in that case would be incal culable. In proof that the above Statement is not over-charged, the following particulars elicited in conversation with several respectable natives of the country are worthy of attention. One of these, Aga Meenas, for more than 30 years a servant of the British Residency, and after acting British Agent, has, after stating several reasons for his assurance that it only required security and justice, freedom from oppression, to render this country equal to the richest parts of India, summed up his opinion by saying : were this Government strong enough to protect the ryot and just enough not to oppress him, the amount now received of Raij Piasters would become Aeen (that is, twenty-five times the sum) within five years, and within 10 they would be rupees or nearly double of the Aeen. Another, Aga Khacheek, also long in the Resident's employ, in con trasting the present with the former state of this country, observed that for long he remembered it a common remark that the country from Soogu Shiook, on the Euphrates, to Bussorah was once so thickly inhabited and cultivated as to leave no interval between the villages and gardens. That travellers proceeding in those days from one place to the other required to make no provision for the journey; they went each day such distance as they pleased, sure of meeting everywhere the necessaries or conveniences they wanted. The ruins of these villages and town still exist to attest the truth of this statement. Even of late years Bussorah, Bushire, Bahrein, and the whole Persian Gulf, even to Muscat, far below it, depended on the rice of Semavah, Soogu, Shiook, &amp;c., which was sent down in immense quan tities. Such is the change to-day, and so completely has this supply failed from the disappearance of cultivation in those districts, that last year not less than 15,00,000 Morabs rather more than 200,000 Ads. of rice were sent up the gulf from the Malabar Coast of India for the supply of these places, and of these 10,000 Morabs reached Bussorah itself. In proof that the Montifick Sheikh is perfectly able to furnish a large revenue to Government, and as a specimen of the manner in which these Arabs oppress the country, it is a fact that the duties he levies (with the permission of Government) upon all boats going down the two rivers are rented at 48 lakhs of Raij Piasters, independent of the enormous dues he collects of the trade in butter, grain, fiour, dates, &amp;c., below the above- mentioned custom posts in the districts about Bussorah. Mahmood Aga, a farmer and lately Governor of Ilillah, in speaking the other day regarding the condition of the Pachalic, observed an instance[ xlix ] of its capabilities that in the time of Daood Pacha the Hindich canal, which now produces 60 lakhs of Piasters, only paid to Government 100 Toghars of grain, or about one lakh Piasters. He himself obtained a lease of it, and, with no other advantage than simply being let alone to Government, in three years raised its produce to 150,000 Toghars or 150 lakhs of Raij Piasters, and, continued he, there are not hundreds but thou sands of such places now in the Jazeerah and Irak, nay in the neighbour hood of Bagdad, which by the same means would increase in a like proportion. The same man in the year 1830 took from Government the Nil canal at a rent of 1,000 Toghars. That year he reaped from it 10,000 Toghars, and his harvest was yet on the ground when the plague first came and swept off his labourers, and then the inundation, which destroyed his crop, yet still he managed to pay his rent to Government. It was calculated that this man, on a tract which he took from Daood Pacha a short time before that Pacha's downfall, lost in three years by war, by pestilence, and by inundation not less than 500 lakhs of the present Raij Piasters, yet this could not have been the whole of his gains, since he still went on. One single instance will serve as a means of estimating the depre ciation of property in the vicinity of this city from the rapacity and feebleness of Government. There is just now a garden offered for sale, not far from Bagdad, the date produce of which alone, after payment of all ordinary dues of Government, is 30,000 Raij Piasters. In Daood Pacha's time the crop of water-melons only netted 50,000 Raij Piasters equal to 150,000 of the present day, and it is acknowledged that with suitable management and encouragement it would yield a yearly income of 200,000 Raij Piasters of this day, yet the proprietor offers it for sale now at 150,000 Raij Piasters, or far less than the annual income it is capable of affording. A little enquiry might elicit hundreds of similar instances, but after what has been already said it appears superfluous to add another word upon the subject. Exd.—J. T.
