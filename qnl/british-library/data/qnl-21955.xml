I am already getting from you monthly statements of imports and exports. Would it be possible for you to give me figures of re-exports also ? I should be most grateful if you could. 2. I should also be grateful if you could kindly append a note to these whenever you think that there are abnormal variations in the volume of import?, exports and re-exports apart of course from the usual seasonal fluctuations.

C/ / 276 of the 27-3-41, and also the receipt of your No. 210-26/24 of the 4-3-41, both of which relate to the Statistical Monthly Trade Report on Imports and I xports, which is prepared by this Department for submission to yourself. 2. Arrangements have been made for the future reports (i.e. for the month of March 1941 and onwards) to distinguish between exports from and re-exports through Bahrain, in this connection may I ask please if it is desired that the countri* of destination should be stated a little mere definitely than 'Saudi Arabia', Yemen' and other parts of Arabia ? it is possible that there may be exports nence to Kuwait, the Truci; Oman, ana remotely to Muscatj and it might be thought desirab. for such other Arab states to be specifically mentioned, alth it would entail adlitional clerical work. 3. It has been agreed that the format of the statistical forms supplied by yourself is somewhat out of date, and it is understood that before it is proposed to indent for a new supply the form should be designed afresh, in view of the distinction now desired between exports and re-exports, woulc it be thought suitable that this new form might be designed now,,please. Cd/- C.C.L. de Grenier Director of Customs &amp; Port Officer, Bahrain. I think so. Perhaps the Director of Customs would be kind enough to suggest a suitable form for the purpose. Would you please reply accordingly and put up for signature.

It is interesting to observe that the transhipment* of rice to Saudi-Arabia is about twice the normal monthly quantity. This is explained by previous irregular callings of steamers, by which quantities awaiting shipment at Karachi were held up. In view of that situation there has been increased activity in Native Craft sailings, which will, of course, fall off as the South-western monsoon developes. 3 . I am told that in view of the present restricted credit conditions, and a certain control at Bombay over Japanese cotton piece goods, D'bai importers cannot obtain deliveries direct. Bahrain importers are endeavouring to deal with this position under the Optional System', which certainly mefets the case. But it is added that the Customs Authorities refuse to permit exporters to affix the mark DUBAI RE on their packages, which is desired at Bahrain to simplify the procedure, and comply with the Emergency Order. I should be very much obliged if you could kindly ascertain for me if this is correct, and, if possible, any reason why packages should not be so marked. I ask this, as I am anxious, if possible, to assist local mercantile activity. The above remarks explain the quantity of goods exported hence to D'bai, please. 4No.C/321-28/6U) Political Agency, Bahrain, the 10th April 1941. v \ To The Collector of Customs BOMBAY 'V Memorandum I am informed by the Director of Customs, Bahrain, that in viewof the present restricted credit conditions and a certain control at Bombay over Japanese cotton piecegoods, Dubai importers cannot obtain deliveries direct. The importers in Bahrain try to get round this difficulty by the 'optional system' by which they get the goods in Bahrain and then re-export them to Dubai; but it is said that the Customs authorities in Bombay refuse to permit exporters to mark their goods 'Dubai/RE# (HE means Re-export) which marking is essential in Bahrain to treat such goods as re-export cargo in compliance with the emergency order under the Defence Regulations by which tfae export of essential comnodities from Bahrain is prohibited, unless they are destined from source for re-export, 2, I should be grateful if you would kindly let me know whether this is true, and if so the reasons for imposing these restrictions as I would like, if possible, to alleviate these difficulties.In reply, please quote the i number and date of this letter and address the officer for whom, it is intended, by designation f and NOT by name.

We can vouch for all vessels under our own control, in this connection, 5, Tankers (whether neutral or belligerent) are cleared through Jufair Naval Base as regards Routing and special Naval Instructions. Would you please inform us how the Navicert System is to be correlated with, and whether it will modify or replace, the existing regulations ? We also wish to be instructed as to the method of applying for and receiving the Navicerts, We believe you will agree that it will be for tiie best interests of all concerned to keep 'red tape' and delays to shipping at a minimum. In this connection, we wish to point out that we normally clear tankers at all times of the day and night and that if copies of the Ship’s Manifests and all docunents covering ship’s cargoes must be submitted to the Agency prior to sailing, delays will be inevitable.

A I N Dear Sir, Reference your letter No# PA-554 dated the 25th June 1941. 2# I do not think that any difficulty need be anticipated over the issue of ships' navicerts. The ship's navicert is really a form of 'passport' for the ship and indicates to examining authorities that the cargo and anything else in the ship has been approved and may be passed without hindrance. Ail that I require therefore is the Master’s cony of the manifests upon which will be entered a certificate showing that all cargo etc., has been approved. This manifest will be kept by the Master and exhibited whenever required by competent authorities. Two spare copies of the manifest should be furnished me for record. The formality will not take more than a few minutes to complete and the manifests may be sent to me at any time before the ship sails, duly completed as regards cargo. Yours faithfully, L.

'Reference our conversation with Mr. D'Sa about Navicerts. The position about the Up Mails is free from doubt. We are the last Consular Fort before entering trie Persian Gulf and issue the Ship's Navicert. ue tnerefore require a complete set of snip's papers to be deposited. As regards down mails, the important point is tnat both we and tue Persian Pcrts on ei£ner side of us, Jasr. &lt;k Cnarbar are outside txie xjavicert area. Karachi Collector of Customs' letter at page 162 contains an error in tnat he sa/s tnat tne snip's Navicerts racist be issued at tne last Consular port before leaving tne Gulf of Oman . Actually it is the Persian Suif , which is defined as the sea inside a line passing from a point immediately east of Bundar Abbas to Ras Musadam (para 4 of page 116). Jask and Charbar are certainly Persian Ports, but unaer the rules they are not Persian rorts for N avicert Purposes . We did not even issue cargo Navicerts on cargo loaded at Muscat on Down Mails, as we falx under exception (a) of section II 2 (i) at page 114. All we need do is to verify that Bandar Abbas has issued a Ship's navicert (a copy of tne s hip's navicert only may be sent asnore and endorsed as'seen at Muscat'), as if tne ship has not cabled at Bandar Abbas, (or failed to observe proper formalities there) sue is bound to call here (see last sentence of para 2 (iii) at page 115. a full set of ship's papers need onj.y be sent asnore if tne snip did not obtain ner snip's navicert at Bandar abbas.

We understand that the Political. Agent, Muscat, refused to grant the Navicert on the grounds that Muscat is not a Navi cert port for vessels leaving the Gulf, even though no call was made at Bandar Abbas and calls were made at ports in the Navicert area after departure from Bahrein. If a vessel is not calling at Bandar Abbas, her Navicert can be obtained at Bahrein, but if calls are made subsequently at Dubai, Sharjah and/or Jask, any cargo loaded at these ports would not be covered by Navicert unless tne vessel made a special call at Bandar Abbas for this purpose or the Political Agent, Muscat, continued to ^rant Navicerts as in uhe past. We are unable to understand why aie Political Agent, Muscat, has refused to continue to grant Navicerts, ar., althou^i Muscat was not mentioned as a Navicert port in the original instructions regarding this Area, the attached Office Note from the olitical Agent, dated 5th September, 1941 (see para 4) clearly states that if a vessel has not called at Bandar Abbas, she is bound to call at Muscat. Further, Bombay Collector of Customs Circular No. 14, dated 14th Mgy , 1941, Section II, paragraph 4, reads as followss- M Certificates of origin and interest and approved bills of lading will be issued by His Majesty's Consular offices at Basra, Khomashahr, Ahwaz, Buanire and Bunder Abbas. Approval of cargo loaded at .andar Shahpour will be signified by His Majesty's Consul, Anwaz. Ships loading at ports in the Persian Gulf ether tuan those mentioned will be reqiired to call subsequently at a neutral port where there is a British Consul, at a British 3mpire port or Kuwait, Bahrein or Muscat.' It would, therefore, appear that Muscat has been established as a Navicert port, and,* if the granting of Na\'icerts there is to be discontinued, notice must be given to Agents at all Gulf ports to enable them to make the necessary arrangeuents, and also to Bombay Collector of Customs for correction of Circular No.14. rCONFIDENTIAL COPY OFFICE NOTE, SHIP NAVICS3TS 2^ ■ . ■' i I Reference our conversation with lir.DeSa about Navicerts - I 111 are x.xxe xay u uunaux^u- jjui u ® ^ issued the Ship's Navicert. We tnerefore require a complete set of Ship's papers to be deposited. 3. As regards Down MailSj the important point is that bo oh we and the Persian ports on either sioe of us, Jask and Charbar, are outside the Navicert area. Karachi Collector of Customs' letter at page 162 contains an eror in that he says tnat the ship's navicerts must be issued at the last consular port before leaving tae lulf of Oman . Actually it is the Persian Gulf, which is defined as the sea in side a line passing from a point immediately East of Bunder Aotas to Has Musandam (para 4 of page 116). Jask and Charbar are certainly Persian ports $ but under the rules taey are uoc Persian ports for davi c : ' t »&gt;uiyoses . 4 . We did not even issue cargo Navicerts on cargo loaded at Muscat on Down Mai la ae we fall under exception (a) of Section 11 2 (i) at page 114. All we need do is to verify that Bunder Abbas has issued a ship's navicert (a copy of the sni:&gt;' s navi - cart only may be sent ashore ana enaorsed as “Seen at isluscat'. As if the snip h^s not called at Bundor Abbas (or failed to observe proper formalities there) she is bound to call here (see last sentence of para 2 (iii) at page 115). A full sat of snip's papers need only be sent ashore if the ship did not obtain her ship's navicert at Bunder Abbas. 5. Confidential Clerk to note. A copy may be sent to B.I. Agents for information.

As yon are aware, a large number of United States vessels call here for bunkers only and are not issued with a Navicert unless cargo is loaded. Further, the Director of Customs does not require these vessels to have a Port Clearance, and it is the lack of this latter document that has prompted the Customs Authorities in Bombay to insist upon the production of the above-mentioned letter from you together with a similar letter from the Director of Customs relating to Port Clearance for these vessels. i f) MD^ * / / l / ' i' 1 V /• I /' / /, 4B f. n f 4 (DUPLICATE) •' !

Political Agency, Bahrain, 2nd Januar}/- 1945&lt; From To Major T.Hickinbo-ham, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain The American Vice-Consul, American Consulate, Dhahran. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your PTH/cjm dated December 1944, 2, Navicerts are of two kinds;- (i) Cargo navicerts (ii) Ships* navicerts Cargo navicerts are not required for goods which are loaded at ports on the Arabian coast nor is it necessary for such goods to be covered by Certificates of Origin so that as far as Dhahran is concerned all that is required is a ship*s navicert. According to the instructions which I have received all vessels leaving the Persian Gulf must be in possession of ships' navicerts issued at the last port of call before leaving the Gulf or if the last port of call is not a British Consular j:ort, at a neutral port where there is a British Consul, or at Kuwait, Bahrain, or Muscat. Thirs unless vessels leaving Dhahran intend to call at some more easterly port they should obtain their ships' navicert from Bahrain. 3. Ships' navicert are issued on the following conditions;- (i) All cargo must be approved by the issuing authority, (ii) Such regulations with regard to the censorship of mails and the carriage of passengers as may be in forc&lt; must be complied v r ith. As regards (i); it will be necessary for this Agency to examine the ship's manifests, and with regard to (ii); it 4 will be necessary for a list of the passengers to be produced ' /and l w VJ VI u4 * L w nu u v».i aaw'g / - 2 - \ v and a record of the mails if any and whether they are censored or uncensored to be attached to the application for the ship^ navicert* 4.

The shies* navicert will be inscribed free of charge on the ships* manifests.

Gray Mackenzie and Company, Limited Bahrain. SH TP NAVICERT SYSTEM Memorar.dun . In regard to the three vessels (whose particulars are mentioned in the enclosed list) which arrived at Bombay from Bahrain without Ship Navicerts, the Government of India has since pointed out that Navicert Regulations do not make any distinction for the purposes of Ship Navicerts, between vessels carrying cargo and vessels in ballast, rhe only excep tion permitted is in respect of tankers on United Nations Service returning to the Persian Gulf from Egypt if they are in ballast, or carrying only empty oil drums or Service stores. The position therefore is that with this excep tion, vessels sailing in ballast to or from the Persian Gulf have to be furwished with Ship Navicerts. 2. It is therefore requested that pending further advice, ship Navicerts be obtained for ships sailing in ballast from the Gulf. political Agent, BahrainGray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd. HEAD OFFICE : 122.

Thank you for all the trouble you have taken. 2. Unfortunately another problem has confronted us in regard to which information on the procedure followed in Bahrain would be most useful. We want to ensure that tankers arriving to load oil do not discharge oily ballast near the coast and thus possibly injure fish or pearl oysters; and to this end to confront on arrival the master of each tanker with a minatory notice. The f, Cil in Navigable waters Act 1922' imposes penalties for fouling certain waters but it has not been applied here, and until we receive a copy we do not know whether the territorial waters of the Persian Gulf are among those specified in the Act. Under what law would you in Bahrain penalise ship-masters fouling the water at Sitra with oil ? 3. Incidentally, unless my office is very much at fault, we have never received any copies of the various regulations issued in Bahrain under the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order-in- Council, 1939, I think a mutual exchange of legislation in future would be beneficial.

Bahrain is usuhlly the last port of call and hence we have been acting under Section n 2,(iii) 'and (iv), Our Navicert being in the form given in para. 3. °1 P.A. Kuwait .bases his argument on the fact that goods are normally bound for India and that India is outside the Navicert area. But it will be noticed that our certificate is concerned primarily with ’’origin' and'interest' and not 'destination'. It seems possible that goods loaded at Kuwait may quite easily not be of local origin or contain an enemy interest via Saudi Arabia and Irak and though we have to date been issuing Navicerts without too close an enquiry, it seems that P.A.

XI. 4/ cL. I. The Customs authorities at Karachi are apparently under the impression that, like them, we not only issue Ships' Navicerts, but also do the work of the shipping agents in making out manifests and other shipping docu ments for the various vessels leaving Bahrain. According to the instructions at p. 113, the Navicert system is applicable to dhows as well as B.I. and other ships, and paragraph 7 of our Notice (p.138) has made this fact quite clear to the Shipping agents and Customs authorities in Bahrain, just as Adviser's Notice (p.145) has made it clear to the general public. In such cases, therefore, when no ship’s navicert has been issued to dhows making a direct passage from Bahrain out of the Persian Gulf, it seems that the Director of Customs is responsible for having given the dhow clearance without seeing that the manifest was suitably endorsed by the Agency; and if P.A. agrees, we may remind him of para. 7 of our Notice, quoting the case in p.u.c. 3. II. As regards dhows proceeding outwards from Qatif, V where there is no Consular port where Ship’s navicerts could be granted, the only alternative seems that they should call at Bahrain before proceeding directly out of the Gulf. This, of course, would mean a reference to P.R., who would, presumably, take up the matter with Minister, Jedda. A' Pt/C . $ ' ft.

Instructions regarding approval of passenger lists are as follows. ' Ship navicert should not be issued to ships which carry;- Passengers, unless in the case of passengers embarking at a neutral port, the passenger list has been submitted to and approved by the appropriate British Consular Authority or, in the case of passengers embarking at British ports, the usual security requirements have been met. * Bteamer Agents at Bahrain as a rule, issue tickets to passengers, only after satisfying themselves that Sxit Permits are held by passengers in the case of Indians and Britishers and Visas in the case of other nationalities.
