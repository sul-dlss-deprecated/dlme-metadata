Subject Report on Mr. (7.R.L. Adrian- Vailance by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, dated 7th January 1942. director of Education, Bahrain.Mr. C, R, L. Adrian-Vallance held the post of Director of ifidu cation in Bahrain from November 19559 till July 1941. Ee tendered his resignation at the end of the school term in July 1941. During the school term of 1^40-41 Mr. Vallance instituted and carried out a number of improvements in the govcmmunt schools mostly on tne lines of the recommendations which ne made to the Bahrain government and which are described in his compre hensive report on education in Bahrain which he made in 1939 before his appointment to the post. Vhe jaost important changes wiiicU he made were the reorganisation of all village schools and the institution of the Secondary School or the Kulliyah. In addition he regularised the teachers into different grades and organised the distribution of school books and material, he raised the age of admission to the 3chools and eliminated the over aged young married men who previously monopolised the upper classes. Mr. Vallance continually stressed the necessity for better teaching in the junior classes which had previously been regarded as needing the least quali fied teachers. He visited Palestine and obtained the services of a number of well qualified teachers recomuBnded by the educational authorities in that country and also enlisted several better educated Bahrain Arabs to teach in the schools. He instituted daily physical drill in the schools and regular visits from —from the State Medical Authorities which have resulted in a noticeable improvement in the health of the students. Repairs, alterations and enlarge ments were carried out in many of the school build ings on Mr. Vallance^ recommendations. Mr. Vallance started a special clasa for young Shaikh®, in the afternoons, in which he taught himsuli . Tne class started with 19 young man and the fact that v /hen the novelty had worn of! the attenuateg u .ocli.u.cd was not the fault of the authorities. Ke also started special classes for the boys who failed to ^ass the entrance examination fox the EUiliyah and who had progressed as far as they could in the primary schools. Although Mr. Vollane a was not an expert in technical education he ran the Technical School during the term, receiving some assistance irom Ur, W. B. Steele, the State Engineer. In the Kulliyah Mr. Vallance gave lessons daily in English, Grammar etc., and introduced new teaching methods with great success. He also dealt with catering and the domestic side ol the school which contained a number of boarders from Kuwait and from Bahrain. In spite of their lacic of sound groundwork the boys in the Kulliyah made good progress during the term. Before the end of the term an examination was held Tor entrants into the Kulliyah in the next term. The various changes which Mr. Vallance mads were carried out after discussion with me and in all cases, except minor matters, with the approval of —of Shaikh Abdullah, the Minister of Education, Some of the changes caused resentoent among the public for example parents v^iose sons failed to pass the entrance examination into the Eulliyah expected their sons to be admitted ii' they happened to belong to the upper classes of Bahrain society• Another matter ^hich was unpopular was the exclusion from the junior schools of boys who lacked the intellicence to pass into a higher school but whose pareiit s wished tham to regain in school. Parents of Mbiy young infants, who previously regarded the aohocl as a creche, were indignant when snail infants, incapable of learning, wera not admitted to the low®r classes v /hore previously they had been convaniently ^parJcod^ for the day. In the begin ning there was jome complaint at n-edical ijispections in the Muharraq school whore the headmaster had un- wisely f ailed tc tel3. the boys why the doctor was eomicg to the 3 0hv :ol but at the other schools no t objections were raised. The matters immediately preceding Mr. Vallance's resignation have been referred to in previous corres pondence and a report on his vvork during the year is not an occasion for discussing them. Mr* Vallance worked under me and close cooporation .v'ith me, he A carriod out changes in tho atiucational oystam which, who ever had held the post, would have inevitably caused some resentment. Vlith lihe object of improv- eduoation he adopted measures which were contrary to old establishod and unsatisfactory systems. Every new institution or improvement which has been started in —In Bahrain has at first been regarded looally with suspicion and mistrusti municipalities, girl*3 schools, the minors' departmant, diving reforms, etc. etc. , were all ths sibject of public opposition when they were introduced. Some of the reforms which wers introduced in the educa tion department provided similar opposition. Xn his contacts with the local ^Vrab authorities Mr. Vail ance was not alto^ather successful. He consulted Shaikh Abdullah only on general policy and did not discuss details with hixa and as a result anyone witih a grievance about school affairs could obtain a lie tiring from Bhailch Abdullah who oft.er. had no know] edge of the matter under discussion. Mr. Vallence was not very accessible to parents o^' boys but his work, including giving daily lossons, occu pied most of his time. As a result of Mr. Vallance's work, education in Bahrain has Improved very greatly. The principles which ho adopted and the methods and improvements which he introduced are now In force and no difficulties are being made by the boys or parents. The Kulliyah or Secondary School as it is now called, has increased to two classes, next year there will be a third class, and there was no trouble over the failure of boys to pass the last examination. A special doctor nas been allotted as a school doctor and every school is visited at least once a week, and in general the reconmendat ions made by Mr. Vallance are being carried out by his • successor. During his time as Director or Education in Bahrain Mr. Vallance achieved results which should enable —-5- anable his successor to continue the progress of education on sound lines without provoking the feelings of the local inhabitants and *ith real arid lasting benefit to the people of Eahrain. 7-1-1942.v A A GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

Dear Alban, I find that it will be necessary for Patchings to go himself to Bombay in order to obtain the material for the Technical School. He will proceed there by air as soon as a passage is available and 1 am authorising him to purchase goods up to the sum of Rs. 25,000/-. He has received quotations from Bombay for much of the material but as some of it is second hand and in some cases no quotation is given the suppliers urge that he should see the goods before purchasing. 1 should be very grateful if \#ou would inform the proper authorities in Delhi that Hutchlngs is being sent to Bombay to deal with the matter. His address will be care of The Eastern Bank Limited, Bombay. It is not possible for him to supply the list of material, which will be required before an exoort permit can be issued, until he has seen and selected the goods Would it be possible for you to give him a letter sta ting that he is on official business which he could show to the authorities in Bombay ? I think this would be of assistance. When he has made the selection and applies for an export permit it will be necessary for him to quote some official correspon dence on the subject. We are very anxious to get the material. The opportu nity of obtaining it v/ill probably become less as the war goes on. If we can buy the machinery, tools etc., which Hutchings recommended and which are now available in Bombay the School will be able to carry on for the duration of the war. Yours sincerely, C.

They point out that they expected a 'Kulliyeh' , and not a secondary school of lower standard than the one they were attending in Baghdad. In a dition to this they complain of the 'ood, the be Is, the 'eneral conditions anl the restricted life. In Baghdad they live 1 in private houses vith all lodern conveniences. The complaint about the food is that the rice is poor and thrt they will not ept Karachi rice. The beds must be of iron, carpets on the floors, proper bathrooms and more variety in the breakfast provided.

Ife have recently had an unfortunate experience over four boys who were sent by the I'uscat Government as boarders to the Bahrain secondary ichool. Their behaviour was most unsatisfactory and though they spent about two months in the School they refused to do any lessons. Eventually they were sent back to Vuscat. These boys had spent some time at School in Bagdad and their manners and behaviour confirms my opinion that education in Iraq almost invariably produces unsatisfactory results. Boys from Bahrain who have been educated or partially educated in Syria have not turned out much better. The Secondary School has not been long enough in existence to become a regular institution and at present it is not a suitable place for boys who have previously been at Schools in Baghdad or Beyrouth Should any further applications be made to send boys from other Gulf States as boarders to the Bahrain Secondary School the Bahrain Government would not accept candidates who have previously been in Schools abroad. Applications will only be accepted for boys from local Schools in the Gulf States. 1 think it is necessary to make this decision in order to prevent any recurrence of the Tuscat students affair.flo.C/162.

Muh&amp;rraq on Saturday March 14th and v/as very favoaraoly impressed by the standard of education for girls reached in the 3tate. We went first to the school in Manama, v/here there are about 150 girls. This school does not possess the advantage of a building specially designed for the purpose, and for tM s reason some of the class rooms are dcrlc and not v f ry well ventilated, and there is not enough room to accommodate all the girls properly. One clas^ has actually to be held in a room which Is also the only pas age between tv/o parts of the school, and the constint ^ass ng and re passing is very disturbing. There are six classes here, and the children start to attend school about the age of six, but there is no Kindergarten proper owing to the lack of trained Kindergarten teachers. I visited each class and thought the standard of work good, but in almost every class more atten tion needs to be paid to neatness and cleanness. The weakest subject is arithm-tic. The needlework is very good, the gi~ls take a great Interest in this subject and produce excellent results, but here again they need to keep their work cleaner. Muharraq . The school in Muharraq occupies build'ngs specially designed for it, and most of the class rooms are light and well ventilated. The number of girls has increased very rapidly and still more could be taken if there we-e room for them. An Arab house standing in the c mpounc is now being used as class rooms and thesp are dark and rather stuffy In this school there are two Kindergarten forms where the chil dren do their work on the Proebel s 'stem, anr' use aooaratus specially made for them. English is taught from the third form upwards, but the children in the Kindergarten 1'am the / lettersletters of the F^glish alphabet at the sane time as they learn the Arabic ones. The standard of work in both AraMc and English is good, but a little mor* C' re is needed in the pronunciation of the latter* In this school also + e standard in arithmetic was not so good as in the other subjects. Ehe needlework is excellent and the work clean and neat, and in the sixth form the girls are also taught dress making. I was very much struck by the keenness and interest shown by the girls in both the schools, and their health seemed good except for the appall ingljhigh percentage of eye troubles. A nurse attends twice a week at I'uharraq to deal with minor treatments and look after the general health of the girls. I think it would be an excellent thing to stcrt girl guide companies and Blue Bird Flocks in the schools, as this would give the girls an interest connected with the school apart from their actual lessons, and also encourage them to do more in the way of physical culture.

In view of the difficulties of the English larguage, any method which would simplify the learning of it is to be welcomed. But I am doubtful whether the basic system satisfies all reasonable requirements in this respect. Its limited vocabulary is necessarily artificial and for this reason is not a good preparation for those who wish to acqiire a mastery of the idiom or the ability to appreciate fully English literature. It is f ai rly clear that anyone who has 3e arnt English according to the basic system will have to unlearn a good deal before he can proceed to an intensive study of the real language. i &lt; k or this reason I can only regard it as a fairly easy method of acqiiring a sufficient knowledge of English for simple working purposes.Confidential .

Wakelin arrived In Bahrain on Ootr 6, 1941 during my absanco in Xndia 9 h© iinmadlately took o'ver his duties as Director of Education. He has carried out his work in a satisfactory manner without causing resentment among th« public who for several years have made School administration a subject for legitimate and illegitimate criticism. Mr. Wakelin, during his first term, has had several rather difficult incidents to deal with and he has handled them in a sensible manner. Soon after he took over, a group of students from Muscat arrived in Bahrain to be educated at the Secondary School where they remained for about two months refusing to work and behaving in a most unsuitable way. Bventually they were returned to Muscat. Mr. Wakelin displayed tact and restraint over this incident. During the term Mr. Wakelin moved the School Hostel from the building which it previously occupied to a new house where the boys are successfully installed. Mr. Wakelin has showed himself to be energetic in visiting country schools which have always lacked the amount of supervision which has been given to the big schools in the towns and he has made contacts with many of the fathers of the boys by visiting them in their houses and seeing them in his office. Education in Bahrain is ostensibly under the direction of Shaikh Abdul^bin Isa who is known as the Minister of Education. Mr. Wakelin has endeavoured to discuss with Shaikh Abdulla all matters concerningeducation but, as in the time of his predecessor, it appears that Shaikh Abdulla is disinclined to take an active interest in education affairs though doubtless he would resent any action which he con sidered an infringeiaent of his position* Mr. Wakelin has co-operated successfully with the Principal of the Governmeut Technical School which although a separate institution is connected in many directionswith the other schools. Mr# Wakelin has worked well during his first six months and his qualifications and experience fit him for dealing with the educational work which is now being done in Bahrain*b'l Certified that on the Ist June 1942 Mr. V/akelin was still in the service of the Bahrain Government. y Political Agent, Bahrain. 12th June 1942..^S | sv( v1 No.C/923• Political Agency, Bahrain, the 28th June 1942.

Memorandum. &gt;7' jference correspondence resting with my memorandum No.C/923 dated 28th June 1942, regarding Mr. Wakelin, Director of Education, Bahrain. X/ 2# I enclose a copy of a letter No.PG/l/3A, dated 18th March 1942, and of its enclosures, addressed to me 'by the British Council on the subject of certain expenditure incurred by the Council over Mr. Wakelin 1 s journey to Bahrain last October. Since its arrival, the subject has been under correspondence between the Adviser and myself. 3. The Bahrain Government have not unnaturally objected to the statement that these accounts have been settled 'on behalf of the Government of Bahrain. They point out that the corres pondence leading up to Mr. Wakelin 1 s appointment gave no grounds for the suggestion that they are responsible for the complete cost of transporting him, his family and his possessions from Cairo to Bahrain. The question of the liability for these costs was not specifically dealt with in the correspondence preceding his arrival, for the reason that Mr. Dundas himself suggested (vide your telegram No.407 dated 9th May 1941) that Mr. Wakelin should be employed under the same terms as his pre decessor: and the Bahrain Government accepted this suggestion (vide your telegram No.T/597, dated 7th September 1941, to Mr. Dundas). Clause 7 of Mr. Vallance's contract (copy for- warded with my Ko.C/336-lb/5 of 21st'April 1940) provided for payment by the Bahrain Government of the cost of one first-class passage by rail and sea to Bahrain. A copy ot this contract / was V BUSHIRE RESIDENCY. No. /Q v&gt;. Date - •-&gt; , r4 was subsequently sent direct to Mr. Dundas, vide this Agency -jMU' (M C-?3 endorsement No.C/9S0-4/16-B, dated 3rd October 1941. 4. The Bahrain Government have pointed out that, in the case of other British subjects in their employ, including Tr. Vallance, they have given no allowance to cover cost of families' passages, and in view of the clear reference to one passage in their contract with Mr. Vallance they see no reason why this rule should be varied in the case of I r. Wakelin. They are therefore prepared to pay the first item in the statement of expenses (Annexure D to this letter), but not the second and third. 5. As regards the costs of transport of Mr. Wakelin 1 s 'bgggQg© Xshown as item 4 in Annexure D and detailed in Annexure 3) I enclose a copy of paras 4 and 5 of a demi-official letter of the 13th June 1942 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government -O- (Annexure H). It will be seen that, despite the fact that Mr. Vallance 1 s contract made no provision for payment by the Bah rain Government of the cost of transporting his effects, they have agreed in the circumstances to pay £ 20 (English) on account of this item out of a total of £184.395 Egyptian. In connection with para 4 of the Adviser's letter, it may be noted that in your same telegram No.T/597, dated 7th September 1941, referred to above,it was made clear to Lr. Dundas that free furnished quarters would be provided. 6. I consider the Bahrain Government's attitude to be reasonable and agree with them that the British Council i^ad no business, without their previous authority, to incur 'on their behalf' expenditure amounting to some £ S.244 on account of transporting Mr. Wakelin's lamily and luggage. 7.

Regarding cost of conveying heavy luggage and furniture from Cairo to Bahrain by overland route. The goods, valued at £400/- filled a 6 ton lorry, according to the bill, and included a quantity of furniture. The Government provides officials with furnished quarters and any additional furni ture etc., which they import is paid for by themselves. Quite a lot of the furniture in my own house and in some of the other British Official^* houses is their own property and was purchased locally or brought in by them at their own expense^. 5. As however .fakelin was required to come here by air he could not bring any of his heavy baggage with him and I think it is reasonable that he should be given an allow ance to cover the cost of bringing a normal quantity of baggage with him. Dr. McDowall, the late Lady Medical Officer was paid £12.11.0d for her heavy baggage which she sent round by sea as she herself travelled by land. Hatchings was allowed £15/- for his heavy baggage as he also travelled by air. He wrote and asked if he might bring his wife and child, on his own responsibility and at his own cost, and he was allowed to do so. In the case of Wakelin I think £20/- for dispatch of his heavy baggage would be a reasonable sum.MEMORANDUM uP AGnEEMENi made this sixth day of October, One Thousand Nine Hundred and Fortyone, BETWEEN His Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad al- Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain, on behalf of the Govern- ment of Bahrain, of the one part AMD Mr.^.J. /akelin of the other part, WITNESSETH that it is mutually agreed that the Government of Bahrain will employ the said Mr.F.J.

Since seeing you I have given the matter careful thought and my wife and I have both decided to stay on at least until June 1944. Much as my wife would like to get away I feel that we shall lose so much if we do so. Prom my own point of view I can say that never have I had a job I like so well and to which I feel I am so suited. My first year has been one of finding my way about. It is only now during my second year that I feel we are making progress. School work is such that the fruits of planning are slow to ripen. Should I hand over to someone else at the end of this summer term much of what I have done will be lost. With another year or possibly two in which to consolidate, some of it, at least, may become permanent. My wife and I have talked this over very carefully and we are agreed that it is best to stay. I am looking forward to taking you round the schools during your next visit to Bahrain. Yours sincerely. P HIRE RESIDENCY.

They follow a common syllabus and are provided with books for all students in all subjects. In October Handwork axii Drawing wero added to the curriculum. The increase in the number of classes has meant the engage- munt of 10 additional staff. Most of these were found locally, si* beint, from the Secondary School. There has been a i.ariced improveia nt in the standard of teachin? throughout the year, particularly in the Kindergarten c-lasses. Scondary School . Ther are three forris in the Secondary School, In October last, at tm be. n dng of tl&lt;Q school year very few boys were ^admitted froi the Primary Scho Is and promotion within the school was strictly lir.iited. In this wa it was possible to advance tiio curriculum by one year. Thus Form 1 is doing t. v o wonc of last year's Fo xm the new Fortii ci that oi last year*a Form 3 and the new Form 3 are pricing on a more advanced syllabus. The Primary jSducati n of the present Secondary Schoolboys was, through no fault of their own, very poor. Their knowledge of Arithiaetic did not extend beyond a superficial acquaintance of the Four Rules, Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry were unknown to them. They had 'road three books 1 in English but could not maice use of the lantfia^e in any vway. The History and Geography were lii ited to a few useless 'facts 1 tnat they had corimitted to memory. It is on this basis that we neve t build our Secoraiary Sducation. Arithmetic Algebra, Trigonometry, Science, History and Geo^rapny had to be taught from tno in ning. Thus we have the anomaly of Primary Schoolboys studyiru- booKa which are used in the higher For .;s of the Secondary School.In this lies the answer to the crltioiams of our lack of enterprise In not teaching typing, and other secretarial and commercial subjects. So muc leeway has to oe made up In trie subjects of the Prliaary School that It Is as yet Impossible to make additions to the syllabus. In a very few years time we shall find boys in Form 1 who are more advanced than those In our present Third Form. The Hostel . The aoconuaodatlon in the hostel has bean considerably Increased. Sight new rooms have been added to the 8 original and the kitchen, bathrooms and latrines completely rebuilt. There arenow 6 dormitories to accommodate 35 boys (2 dining rooms - one for the staff), a large games room, a library, a staff sitting room, 2 jtaff bedr oms, an office and a mosque. The boarders are unaer constant supervision and are expected to take their part in keeping the building clean. Village Schools . There are three in number. In all cases the standard is deplorable. We have now overcome the difficulty of overcrowding by adding two or more class -rooms to each school. Where formerly 80 - 90 children were sitting on the floor of one room, each class has its own classroom and the maximum number is restricted to 40 per class. In only 3 classes out of 15 are there more than 25 per class. It is impossible to recruit suitable local staff, and teacheri from the towns naturally refuse to reside in the villages. We therefore provide transport for the staff of these schools. Two boys from each of the village schools are living in the Hostel attending the Manama Primary Schools. In this wa- we hope to train thorn as teachers so that in years to come they may return to their villages as school masters. The prverty of the villagers -is lamentab}^ . They are under fed, miserably clad and carry the dirt and disease of years. To alleviate this we provide every village schoolboy with four loaves of bread per day and have during the year issued two sets of clothing to them. Staff . In August 1943 the Director of iSducatlon visited Jerusalem and Beirut in search of teaching staff. He was unable to Induce anyone to serve in Bahrain as tne salaries in their own coun ries we so much higher than the Grovernment of Bahrain could pay. During the year we lost four of our foreign staff, two Palestinians and two Syrians. In three oases the reason was the attraction of vary well paid jobs in their homeland. The fourth, the Headmaster of the Secondary School, resigned because of the ill-health of his irife. There are no local men who can replace them.I 10 - 3 - Public Librar y. In May 19415 the Secondary School produced a play the proceeds from which euaountGd to Kj.3 t 400/-» This sum has been used for the purchase of books for a Public Library.

I have seen something of the schools since I came to Bahrain and of Wakelin's work. He is not having at all an easy time, quarrels among the school teachers, Mrs.Belgrave Jealously guarding the girls schools from what she calls interference and others would call advice, and Hutchings brooding over the inefficiencies of the Technical School like a gloomy mephistopheles. The reluctance of the Bahrain Government to pay adequate salaries to teachers from overseas has not made his work any easier. I am taking this up with Belgrave within the next few days. 3. V/akelin is no genius nor does he impress the casual observer with his organizing ability or erudition. He is a solid unimaginative middle class person with a touch of the missionary spirit and is doing a very good and sound piece of work here in Bahrain.

The proposals also met with a good deal of opposition from Belgraye, most of it quite sound in it self t on the grounds that the proposals for a oulf College would take the control away from the State without giving them any appreciable benefits and involTO them in a great deal of,expense without any vary tangible r ? fi 1 « it s . ^ ** ^ fm, * ■* j f 9— t 2.

He showed ' a great deal of oiergy at the start* but was unfortunately lacking in the tact required £br this post v and the State asked for a change. The British Council 9 who theniselves considered Adrian Yallance rather hot-headed, provided us with a roan called tfakolin who had fornorly been in the Steviart Memorial Go liege at Isf^ian and later as technical instructor with the A.I .C .C.

Article XVII. of the Lease of 29th December 1934 merely states that as'many of the employees of the Company in Bahrain as is consistent with the efficient carryinr on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects, of the Shaikh of Bahrain. The corresnondinr Article (16) of the A.I.O.C, Concession of 29th April 1933 stipulates that the Company shall make a yearly rrant of £.10,000 in order to rive in Great Britain, to Persian nationals, the professional education necessary for the oil industry. ( The oririnal D'Arcy Concession contained no such clause.) V/hile we cannot rely on anythinr contained in the concession, in view of the example of the A.I.O.C., Banco could scarcely refuse a request by the Shaikh that they should run the Bahrain technical school themselves. It is a small undertaking in comparison with (a) what the A.I.O.C do for Persian nationals and (b) with the nrofits thev make in Bahrain where they are. free from any form of income or Company | V tax. Moreover, if they were prepared in principle to train Chinese students in Bahrain, they could scarcely refuse to train Bahrain nationals. p. It may be that th&lt;9 Company in its own interests of. buildinr up a supply of trained local artizans, will, if not exactly wel/come the scheme, raise little, objection. ^ fa- (ft- 17/P/44,\Q *&gt; n s '.CTT^I^Z 'J.

Various factors tend to cause delay, some of them purely mechanical (e.g., the difficulty in tiie mere publication of some eighty budgets by the Duplicating Section when, as happened this year, its staff is depleted by illness at a time when other urgent demands compete with those of the Finance Division), but a basic cause has been the late arrival of the majority of the estimates. It must be realised that the transformation of the estimates, as received, into the approved budgets, as finally issued, is a long and complex process. The estimates are first sifted and checked in the Headquarter Division concerned and in the Finance Division: they are then examined in considerable detail by the Budget Sub-Committee of the Executive Committee of the Council, for which purpose summaries, with explanatory notes, have to be prepared in the Finance Division: they are next submitted, in a still further summarised form, to the Treasury, the Foreign Office and other Departments of State concerned, and, after an interval for their examination, are discussed at a meeting of representatives of the Council and all these Government Offices: finally, they are minuted on in the Treasury for consideration by the Chancellor of the Exchequer before he decides the amount of the Grant-in-Aid. This, moreover, is not the end of the story. The Grant-in~Aid approved is always less than that postulated in the estimates submitted to the Treasury. This necessitates revision and pruning of the estimates by the Budget Sub- Committee, for which purpose proposals must be prepared by the Finance Division in consultation with the other Headquarter Divisions. It must be remembered, too, that the Budget Sub- Committee, which held eight sessions to consider the estimates for 1944/45, is composed of eminent and extremely busy people engaged in other work of national importance, so that it is not possible for the Sub-Committee to sit for long hours on consecutive days in order to expedite its work on the estimates, though several of its members made notable personal sacrifices to that end in December last. &lt; To provide adequate time for the lengthy procedure just described, it has been found necessary to fix an earlier date for the submission of the estimates; and Heads of Departments and Regional Representatives are earnestly requested, in their own interest and in that of the Council as a whole, to submit their estimates by or before the dates laid down in this memorandum. For the same reason, they are asked to exercise great care in the preparation of their estimates and the filling-up of forms. The correction of errors and omissions involves wholesale alterations of other items and of totals and so causes much extra work and entails unnecessary delay.J X ^ PROCEDURE OF REPfiESEMTATIVES ABROAD Representatives, in estimating for the next financial year, should use Forms EC1, EC2 and ECL and Schedules PS1, PS2. GSS, GSM, LFS and EXT. These forms must be despatched in time to reach the London Office as soon as possible after 1st September, and at the very lates t by 1st October . Personnel Basic salaries, gross salaries, part salaries and supplements to salaries of whatever kind should be entered under 'Personnel' on Form EC1 (Schedules PS1 and PS2). It should be noted that posts are to be budgeted for and not individuals. In the case of London Appointed staff, the average basic salary of the grade of the post should be entered, except in the case of the Representative, whose actual basic salary should be entered. In the case of Locally Appointed staff, proposed increments should be included at the full yearly rate. On Schedules PS1 and PS2 the column headed 'Subsidy' is for entering the supplements to salaries, paid by the Council, as opposed to posts contracted and fully paid by the Council which should be entered in the column headed 'Basic Salary' or 'Gross Salary'. Marriage allowance should be entered on Form EC1 as an average total for the country. It is calculated as one-tenth of the total of the average basic salaries of Grade II posts plus one-eighth of the total of the average basic salaries of Grades III and IV posts. Local allowance should be entered on Form EC1 as an average total for the country. It is calculated by applying the local allowance rate for the country to the total of the average basic salaries of all London Appointed staff and to the marriage allowance as calculated in paragraph 4 above. Entertainment allowance should be entered on Form EC1 as the total of all entertainment allowances paid to officials as part of their emoluments, for entertainment in their homes by virtue of the representational responsibility of their posts, and should be supported by a detailed statement (Statement A) of such allowances attached to the estimates. Block grants for public entertainment should be entered under 'Entertainment' on Schedule GSM (Maintenance). Travelling expenses and subsistence allowances for officials travelling within the country should be entered under 'Travelling. Subsistence, Transport, Insurance' on Schedule GSM (Maintenance). Special entertainment allowances (in respect of high rentals) should be entered on Form EC1 as the total of all such allowances as are in force at the time of submission of the estimates and should be supported by a detailed statement (Statement A) attached to the estimates. General Services Any service which is general to the country and cannot rightly be included under any of the Local Functional Services should be entered as a separate item under 'General Services' on Form EC1 e.g.. Leave allowance, staff conventions and courses, medical services, etc. Local scholarships are considered to be a general service and should be entered in detail on Schedule GSS and as a total on Form EC1 under 'General Services'. P.T.OMaintenance (Schedule GSM) should not include salaries or wages of any kind. The sub-division ^Maintenance of buildings and equipment 51 is intended to cover small recurrent items of repair, replacement and renovation, but not ma^or items of this kind, which should be entered on Schedule EXT under 1f Building and reconstruction' or 'Furniture and equipment'. Subsidies (Schedule gss) should never be calculated on a scale to permit an institution to build up a reserve by virtue of Council funds, but should be the sums estimated to be necessary to cover the yearly deficits, subject to any maximum which has been laid down. Subsidies are for institu tions not under Council control. Expenditure on those fully controlled by the Council should be entered on Schedules PS1, PS2 and GSM. ^ Local Functional Services This sub-heading refers to the expenditure on Functional Services incurred and controlled in a country and should be entered on Schedule LFS and Form EC2. Extraordinaries This sub-heading refers to all capital and definitely non-recurrent expenditure (including non-recurrent subsidies to institutions, which are distinguished from recurrent subsidies by being termed subventions) and should be entered on Schedule EXT and Form EC2. London Services On Form ECL should be entered the requirements of the country for the supply from London of books and of periodi cals. The scholarships to Great Britain to be offered in the coming year will already have formed the subject of correspondence between the Representative and the Director of the Students Department in London, and may be entered for the purpose of cross-checking with the budget of the Students Department. Services required from other functional departments in London should not be entered on Form ECL. The Representative should have already indicated such requirements in correspondence with the Directors of the various departments. Column A (Forms EC1 and EC2) Original allocations mean the allocations as set out in the original approved budget for the current financial year. Column B (Forms EC1 and EC2) 'Revised expenditure' means the original allocation plus any supplementary allocation; plus any sum vired to the item; minus any savings declared; minus any sum vired from the item, all in accordance with the Forms B, V and S received by the Representative up to the time of submission of the estimates. In addition , if the Representative at this time foresees any further definite savings, or if he has declared any further savings in respect of which he has not received Forms S, he should deduct these in Column B and, at the same time, declare them in full detail against the appropriate schedule items in his explanatory notes on the estimates.18.

Cprresponden ce with London In 1944/45 the total budget of the Council has tion of a budget of this size, comprising over eign y P .T.O.individual budgets and thousands of items, entails a very great volume of work for the London staff. It would, therefore, be of great assistance if Representatives would endeavour to secure that requests for approval of new projects and general correspondence with London of all kinds are reduced to an absolute minimum during the months of October, November and December* It is of equal importance that omissions and errors in the estimates should be avoided. Last minute adjustments, even if the amounts are negligible, involve, each time, the alteration of scores of totals and conse quently a great amount of labour in cross checking.

Courses for Training: (I) ARCHITECTS, (2) BUILDERS. Introduction India is the home of at least two distinguished phases of architectural development, principally for beauty and elegance. To the aesthetic side of architecture has increasingly beer added the utilitarian. For the progress of this country to a happy future, architecture in all its aspects will play an important part, inasmuch as the architect can plan more comfortable and healthy places of work, wherein efficient and contented men may earn more. The architect can also design more cheerful homes for them, improve hygienic standards by giving rational ideas and above all, make life more pleasant by providing beauty in the build ings, parks, lakes etc., they plan. By providing suitable courses in Architecture and Building at the Polytechnic, it is hoped that the services of qualified architects will eventually come within general reach. This institution also aims at reviving interest in Indian architecture and help preserve its traditional glory in consonance with modern ideas.

THE BRITISH COUNCIL j g BUDGET MEMORANDUM NO. 1 The notes which follow are intended for the guidamie . of those responsible for spending the funds of the^Council. They are somewhat lengthy and to some of the recipients a number of the points stressed may appear obvious^ but all these points, even the most obvious, have been the subject of misunderstandings, in one quarter or another, during the past year. The notes should be read in conjunction with the printed Finance Circular No. 1, familiarity with which would have prevented most of these misunderstandings. A copy of this circular is attached. The Budget 1. It has been insufficiently realised that the budget constitutes a detailed financial programme, departure from which is not permissible without proper authority obtained by the procedure laid down) and that the sum set against each item of the budget is a limit which must not be exceeded with out financial approval, except in the circumstances dealt with in para. 17 of Finance Circular No. 1. Items, in this con text, does not merely mean the summarised items on Forms A^l and AC2, but the items in the Schedules PS1, PS2, GSS, GSM; LFS and EXT» Virement 2. Attention is particularly drawn to paras. 1^17 of Finance Circular No, 1, which deal with this matter. 3. The authority given in para. 17 of that circular to Heads of Departments and Regional Representatives to exercise virement within stated limits does not extend to the creation of new recurrent items of expenditure by means of virement. 4. The item for Maintenance in Regional Budgets calls for comment. Although this item is subdivided into various services - rent, cleaning, etc., - these subdivisions are not budgetary items. They are the basis on which the total alloca tion for maintenance is calculated, but from the point of view of Finance Circular No. 1 only this total allocation for Maintenance is the budgetary item. Virement betv/een its sub divisions may, therefore, be practised by the Representative without reference to London,, provided the total allocation for Maintenance is not overspent. Records 5. Every effort should be made to keep the records of the allocations up to date. Each item should be amended in respect of any approved supplementaries or savings that have been effected. From these records it should be possible at any time to give up-to-date revised figures of the allocations. Records should also be maintained of commitments as they are entered into; and these in conjunction with the actual cash expenditure, ascertained from the books of accounts, should enable the Head of Department or Regional Representative to keep his budgetary position constantly under review. Oversp e nding 6. The rate of expenditure and commitment against an allocation should be carefully watched, and if it gives indica tion that overspending is likely to occur the probable over spending should be estimated and reported to the FinanceDivision as soon as possible with a request for a supple mentary allocation. Adequate time should be allowed for con sideration of such requests, which very often require sub mission to the Finance and Agenda Committee, which meets only once a month. The common practice of requesting immediate approval of supplementary allocations is, therefore, to be avoided whenever possible. Still more to bt deprecated is the reporting of an overspending as inescapable, or even as an accomplished fact - vide the Chairman's letter No. GB/6/53 of 17th August, 1943. Commitments 7. Recurrent expenditure is shown in the budget at the full annual rate, and it is most important that, in addition to keeping the actual expenditure in the financial year within the allocation, administrative officers should not commit the Council to expenditure in the following financial year above this figure without reference to the Finance Division. There may be, for example, an allocation of £2,000 for the maintenance of a new Institute. If the Institute is not opened until half way through the financial year it is not permissible to spend the full £2,000 in the remaining six months (which might com mit the Council to £4,000 in the next financial year) but only to spend at a rate of £2,000 p.a., i.e., £1,000. Similarly, if there were a budget item of £400 for two clerks, against which only one clerk had been appointed at £200 p.a., at 1st April, it would not be permissible, half-way through the financial year, to make two more appointments at £200 p.a. each, because, although there would be sufficient money to pay them £100 each for the remaining six months, the Council would thereby be committed to pay £600 to three clerks in the succeeding financial year. In point of fact, the overall deduction for shortspending in the 1944/45 Budget (see Finance Circular No. 1, para. 16) is so large that it will be necessary to take as a saving, at the end of each quarter of the year, one-fourth of the emoluments of any post unfilled, and one- fourth of the provision for recurrent expenditure on any pro ject not begun, at that date. Receipts 6. All receipts from whatever source must be paid into the Council's local imprest account. The fact that receipts are in excess of the budget estimate does not justify expendi ture or commitments which have not been properly authorised; nor does a shortage of receipts entail any reduction of approved expenditure. The Finance Division should be notified of any probability of excess or deficit as soon as it becomes obvious, if possible with an estimate of its probable amount. Lump Sum Allocations 9. When a budget contains a lump sum allocation to cover a number of projects which are not specified in detail (e.g., 'Improvement of Teaching of English, £3,000) prior authority must be obtained from London before expenditure is incurred against this item on any specific project. (See Finance Circular No. 1, para.. 7.) 10. Some confusion has apparently arisen over the authority delegated by the circular letter GB /6/69 of 2nd July, 1943. If a Regional Budget contains on Schedule PS2 an item of, say, '6 clerical staff, £1,800' it is within the authority of the Representative to make an appointment againstthis allocation at a salary up to the maximum approved for his area, but not to create more than six new posts. Prior approval from London must be obtained for any appointment in excess of six or for payment of a salary in excess of the maximum. Moreover, the total of the full annual salaries of the staff chargeable to this item must not exceed £1,800 unless approval from London for nupplementary allocation has been obtained (see para. 7 above}. Contingencies 11. The budgets of a number of countries contain on Schedule EXT an item 'Contingencies'. Expenditure against^ this item may not be incurred on Personnel or General Services or on projects entailing future commitments of any^kind. Nor may such funds be used to supplement allocations which for any reason have proved inadequate. They may be used without reference to London only for unforeseen non -recurrent items of expenditure, within the limits mentioned below. 12. The maximum amount which may be spent, without reference to London, against the allocation for Contingencies on any one item is:- £50 when the contingencies allocation is £1,000 £2'^ ii » ' ' ' £250 £j_q ii 11 11 ' ' £100 n ii ' ' £50 London Service s 13. As noted on the form itself. Form ACL is for informa tion only and is not part of the Regional Budget. The items included on it are not budgetary items but records of the Services supplied by certain Departments in Lonc.on. Wo expendi ture can be charged to them by Representatives abrodd^ and they are not available for purposes of virement, being entirely under the control of the Directors of the London Departments concerned. Charges on London 14. Expenditure incurred abroad under the heads mentioned below may be charged to the appropriate budgets in London by means of debit notes:- Central A dm inistration (General Services) Travelling expenses and subsistence allowances of officials from London visiting the area; of 'London- appointed' staff coming into or passing through the area on first appointment or transfer; and of 'London-appointed 1 ' staff from other areas travelling through the area on Council business or home leave. Any installation or transfer allowances payable and due to 'London -appointed' staff on first appointment or transfer. Passages home for 'London-appointed' staff in the area awarded home leave; and for officials entitled to repatriation. (Pension contributions paid by staff abroad should be credited to London.) Lectures Travelling expenses, subsistence allowances or out- of-pocket expenses in respect of visiting lecturers from London in accordance with whatever agreement regarding such expenses may have been concluded between the lecturer and the Council. ^ ^ P.T.0.Students Travelling expenses of, and advances made to. students en route for Great Britain. ' btuaents Fine Arts Lo c ^j_ Cos ■ j S 01 a.il Fine Art exhibitions including installation, catalogues, publicity,packing and transport. Visual Publicity • 4-. ^? C ? :L costs of Photographic exhibitions including installation and transport except in those cases where in the local^budgetf Specific P ur P 0Ee ^ been included Britain To-d ay Local printing and publishing costs, but not distribu tion cos&gt;,s. Receipts, if any, should be credited to London. Hospitality Travelling expenses and subsistence allowances, if any, of official Council guests to Great Britain. Music Local expenses of concert tours by artists from London. Export, ^P ublication s^ Local costs of took exhibitions including installa tion, catalogues, puolicity, packing and transport. Personnel The budget estimates for salaries and allowances of London appointed'' staff are calculated on the average salaries g ^ aaes into which posts fall. (in the case of the Home Service these grades are at present notional, pending approval by the Foreign Office and the Treasury.) The actual expendi- •H: 2? a P ven P ers onnel item will, therefore, rarely tally with the allocation; but over-expenditure in some regions or departments will be offset by under-expenditure in others. 16. If a ''London-appointed' post, for which there is provision m a Regional Budget, is unfilled, it is permissible, with prior approval from London, to Pay a locally appointed o lce r against the vacancy, but it will be understood that this arrangement blocks the vacancy and that no London - appointment can be made until it is terminated. r ,a.^lPa,^lI._^sU r iMt.g^ orVin^s and Qver-expenditurp •u , J n the first week of January certain figures must oe CaDlea to London. Firstly, the cash expenditure up to ^ist Decemoer in each of the four main categories, i.e.. PersonneL general Services, Local Functional Services and Extraordinaries, together with the total receipts up to 31st December. Secondly, tne estimated total expenditure to 31st March (i.e., for the whole financial year) in each of the four main categories, togetner with the estimated total receipts for the whole year.-5- no Thirdly 1 , the estimated amount of the savings or overspendings (where this amount exceeds £50) on each budgetary item in respect of v/hich savings or overspendings are anticipated. A saving or overspending, here, means the difference between the allocation for an item as it stood on 31st December (taking into account any alterations in it approved up to that date) and the estimated expenditure against that item for the whole financial year. The estimated expenditure will include the delayed payments mentioned in para. 18 below, the amount of which is of course not predictable on 1st January. Payments made after the end of the financial year to whi ch they relate 18. The financial year comes to an end on 31st March; this means that the funds provided for that year cease to be available from that date. It is inevitable, however, that certain expenditure to which the Council was committed near the end of the old financial year will fall for actual payment in the new year. The present practice is to make no provision in the budget of the new year for these delayed payments and not to treat them as a charge against that budget, the n lag ,! of expenditure at the beginning of the year being offset by a similar 'lag' at the end of it. 19. It is essential, therefore, that the records of such delayed expenditure should be kept separately from the records of expenditure against the current year ? s grants, and in each year ! s Record Book there should be a separate section for this purpose. The 1944/45 Record Book, for example, should contain a section headed '1943/44 grants' and in this section should be recorded all payments for goods or services for which written orders were placed in the previous year, each entry specifying the appropriate item number of that year. (Where the Accounts Department are keeping records for departments they will arrange for this to be done.) 20. It must be emphasised that the arrangement described above applies only to settlement of accounts for orders definitely placed before 31st March. It is not permissible, after that date, to continue to place orders against an alloc- tion figuring in the budget of the expired year. If the project for which that allocation was made is not completed and no provision has been made for its completion in the budget of the new year, application must be made to the Finance Division for a new allocation. 21. For recording purposes, all invoices passed for payment on or after 1st April, 1944, which are in respect of commitments entered into in the previous year, should be marked as 1943/44 expenditure, with that year's budget item number stated; and for purposes of subsequent audit they must be supported by documentary evidence of the date at which the commitment was incurred. When the delayed expenditure on 1943/44 commitments is completed, the Finance Division will examine it in conjunction with the total actually expended iu 1943/44 against the grants affected, to verify that the total expenditure against each grant does not exceed the amount provided. Any such excess would constitute an overspending requiring explanation. FINANCE OFFICEhTHE BRITISH COUNCIL Finance Circular No. 1 FINANCIAL CONTROL 1. Financial control is of two kinds. The first is a pre-commitment control and the second a post- expenditure control. The latter depends on accoun tancy and on audit. It may bring to light irregularities and establish responsibility for them ; and, by reveal ing defects in the machinery of expenditure, may lead to its improvement. The former is directed to the prevention of improper or extravagant expenditure and depends on a system under which the prior ' sanction of a designated authority is required for certain kinds of expenditure or for administrative action entailing new financial commitments. It is with this pre-commitment control that the present memo randum is concerned. General Function of the Finance Officer and Finance Division 2. The Secretary-General is ultimately responsible (under the Chairman and the Executive Committee) for economy both in framing policy and in manage ment ; and the inclusion on the Council's staff of a Finance Officer does not relieve him of this responsi bility. Nor does the existence of a separate Finance Division in any way relieve other administrative officers of their duty to be economical. Economy in the expenditure of the Grant-in-Aid is to be obtained by co-operation between the Finance Division and the various other Divisions and Departments of the Administration. 3. The Finance Officer should participate at an early stage in discussions leading to the initiation and settlement of administrative policy. He will naturally be principally concerned with the financial aspects of that policy. Criticism from the Finance Officer should not, however, be limited by any narrow interpretation of the province of finance, but should be allowed fullest scope where any possibility of substantial economy is involved. 4. In the same way, all proposals requiring financial approval, in the terms of this memorandum, must be referred to the Finance Division at an early stage and before a decision is prejudiced or expenditure incurred. The Finance Officer will, as necessary, submit the proposals to the Secretary-General, for his or the Chairman's consideration. 5. If the Finance Officer advises that the concur rence of the Treasury is necessary in any particular proposal involving expenditure, that proposal should be referred to the Foreign Office (or other appropriate office in the case of Empire countries), who are responsible to the Treasury for the propriety of the Council's expenditures from its Grant-in-Aid. Any necessary correspondence with the Foreign Office or the Treasury on proposals involving expenditure must be either drafted, or concurred in, by the Finance Division. The Machinery of Control 6. Before specifying the matters which require sub mission to Headquarters for approval, it will be well to amplify the statement made above (para. 4) as to the machinery of such submission. The approving authorities at Headquarters are the Executive Com mittee and the Finance and Agenda Committee of the Council, or the Chairman representing them, and the Secretary-General, who may delegate part of his authority for certain purposes to the Finance Officer. Reference to the Foreign Office, and in some cases to the Treasury, may also be necessary. The question which of these authorities should be invoked to give approval in a particular case depends partly on the nature of the case and partly on the amount of the expenditure involved. These distinctions do not, however, concern Administrative Officers seeking a financial approval, where this is required, since the channel through which financial approvals must be sought is, in all cases, the Finance Division, whose responsibility it is to see that the proper authority is invoked. Exceptions to this rule should be rare and limited to cases of such urgency that reference to the Finance Division is impossible without frustration of the proposal to be referred. This will seldom occur, except possibly when the Chairman or Secretary- General is on tour. Even in that case, reference to London will not lightly be dispensed with, since these authorities cannot carry with them on tour all the information necessary for a considered decision of a financial question of any importance—such as pre cedents, relevant Treasury rulings, and up-to-date information as to the availability of funds. Whenever a proposal normally requiring reference to the Finance Division is approved without such reference, the fact should be communicated, with the relevant circumstances, to the Finance Division at the earliest possible moment. Proposals requiring Financial Approval 7. In general, when money has been allocated in detail for a specific project or service, the spending of the allocated money is under the control of the Administrative Officer to whose region or department it has been allocated, subject to the conditions set out in this memorandum. (By an allocation in detail is meant one which specifies the staff, services, and non-recurrent expenditure involved in the project and the amount provided under each of these heads. Where the budget contains provision for a project which has not been worked out in detail, e.g. ' New Institute at X—Recurrent expenditure £1,500, Non- Recurrent expenditure £2,000,' the project will be treated as a new one and detailed proposals must be submitted to Headquarters for approval before com mitments against the sums provided are undertaken.) 8. Financial approval is required for all new proposals involving expenditure ; and is also required for proposals involving any of the following matters:— 1. Questions of financial principle. 2. Exceptions to any of the Council's circulated rules or regulations. 3. Creation of posts. 4. Engagement of staff, except where discretion to engage temporary junior staff has been expressly given to an administrative officer. 5. Virement of funds, outside the limits laid down. These matters are explained in more detail below. The first four categories require little explanation.i Questions of Financial Principle 9. A question of financial principle is raised, for example, where there is doubt as to the propriety of a proposal for expendituie, having regard to the terms of the Council's Charter ; or where the expen diture is of a novel type, not covered by any regulation of the Council. Exceptions to any of the Council's Circulated Rules or Regulations 10. An illustration of exceptions to a rule would be a proposal to pay an officer of the Council subsistence allowance at a higher rate than that laid down for his grade. Creation of Posts 11. Proposals for the creation of posts should be confined to the maximum extent possible to the moment when the annual estimates are submitted. After the budget is approved, any new appointment, other than to a post approved in the budget, involves the creation of a new post and must be referred to headquarters for approval. Engagement of Staff, except where Discretion to Engage Temporary Junior Staff has been expressly given to an Administrative Officer 12. The appointment of new staff to posts figuring in the budget requires reference to headquarters in order that the salary which it is proposed to pay to the candidate selected may be considered in relation to his qualifications and to the salaries paid to candidates for comparable posts. Where the budget of a given region contains a lump sum to pay the salaries of locally-appointed junior staff, the Repre sentative in that country has discretion to engage staff and pay them against the budgetary provision without reference to headquarters, subject to any conditions as to maximum salary which may be laid down Virement 13 Virement is the transfer of funds provided in one sub-division of the budget, in which under- expenditure is anticipated, to another sub-division of the budget in which over-expenditure is anticipated. 14. Apart from any particular rules governing the matter, virement is restricted by the general rule that funds provided to finance non-recurrent expenditure may not be used to finance recurrent expenditure without the specific authority of the Treasury. The reason of this restriction is obvious; if money provided for some capital work is diverted, for example, to the engagement of new staff, a commit ment is thereby undertaken which prejudices the budget of the following year. 15. To make the distinction between different types of expenditure clear, the budgets of all departments and countries now show expenditure under four headings ;— (20532) P.69/14. 300 4/44. K.H.K. Gp. 8/8 1. Personnel (salaries and allowances). 2. General Services (maintenance, rent, lighting, etc.). 3. Functional Services (production and distribution of material). 4. Non-recurrent (purchase of land, buildings, equipment, etc.). Of these categories, the first two are definitely recur rent and the fourth is non recurrent. The third ranks as recurrent but for the purpose of virement is associated with the fourth. Thus, while virement is in general only operated between items in the same category, it may take place, with approval from headquarters, between the third and fourth categories. In no circumstances may there be virement from either of the last two categories to either of the first two categories, without Treasury approval. 16. 1 here is a further general consideration which &gt; limits the use of virement in practice. The Council's budget is framed to cover the full annual cost of all recurrent items of expenditure and the full cost of all capital works, after making an overall allowance for probable underspending based on past experience of delays in initiation of new services and in the progress of capital works. (In the financial year 1943/44, this overall allowance amounts to over £134,000.) This means that savings to the amount of 'the overall allowance have already been anticipated when the budget is framed ; so that until savings to this amount have been realised there is no scope for virement. Until that point is reached, any new items of expenditure or any overspending of approved items must be met from the general unallocated reserve, with the approval of headquarters in London, or against any budgetary item for contingencies at the disposal of the Heads of Departments or Regional Representatives. The question of overspending the budgetary provision for a given item should not normally arise during the first three-quarters of the financial year. If, owing to highly exceptional circumstances, it does arise during this period, it must be referred to headquarters for consideration. Apart from such exceptional cases, the state of grants * will be reviewed at the end of the third quarter of the financial year, by which date Heads of Departments and Representatives abroad will have submitted reports on the state of their allocations to the Finance Division, on the basis of which the Finance Division will take such savings as may be necessary to complete the amount of the overall allowance for short- spending, and will consider what measures of virement are necessary to meet the overspendings which are reported as likely to occur, if they are approved. 17. During the remainder of the year, Heads of Departments and Regional Representatives will be authorised to exercise virement between numbered items m the same general category of expenditure provided that the expenditure on a given item is not further increased by more than 10 per cent and that any increase within that limit can be met by savings other than those already taken up, on other items in the same general category, in their budgets.

LCI^DOInI A' d POIST£D 3~^i'T It will be noted that financial provision has been made in these estimates for the presence in Bahrain of two Educational Advisers in 1945/46. Arrangements are in hand for the replacement of the present Adviser, Mr. Wakelin, by another Council official next year. It would, however, be desirable for I-lr. vakelin 1 s su cessdr to proceed to Bahrain several months before xir.Wakelin 1 s departure, in order to ensure a satisfactory take-over&gt;. Item Al - Subsidised Staf:'. This post is at present occupied by '.lr. ..akelin, and will presumably continue to be occupied by him for salary purposes until his contract with the G-overnment of Bahrain terminates in September, 1945« His present 3ross salary, towards which the G -overnment oi Bahrain contributes £30 &lt; -^)er annum, is £1068 15s.Cd. per annum. ^.n the assumption that he will receive a normal increment of Z20 basic salary as from 16b Septe iber, 1944, his gross emoluments from that date will be £1106 5s.Od. per annum, increasing the Council's con tribution to £806 5s.Od. per annum. It willbe seen, therefore, that a supplementary allocation of £22 under PSl/Al of the Persian Crulf allocations for 1944/45 is required to cover the increase for the remainder of the current financial year. When Mr. Wakelin f s contract with the Government of Bahrain expires in September, 1943&gt; it is assumed that the unexpended portion of the allocation under Item Al of these ^ estimates will be used to pay the subsidy towards his successor's salary until the endof the 1S45/45 financial year._ Any adjustment to the rate of the su sidy necessiated by the appointment oi ^a successor whose gross Council eomluments differ fro i tnose o. r^r. 'iakelin can only be made after the event. Consideration has already been given in London to the possibility of requesting the Government of Bahrain to increase their present contribution of £300 towards the salary o^. th© Educational Adviser, but a decision on this point has not yet :een reached. Item B1 - Technical Staff This allocation has been proposedin order to cover the basic salary of i -ir.Wakelin 1 s successor for the period of overlap during which there would be no contribution from the Government of Bahrain and the British Council would therefore be expected to accept full financial responsibility for the Adviser designate. An allocation would not be needed after the date that the Adviser designate officially took over from the outgoing Adviser. If, as would be desirable, a successor is appointed before the conclusion of the current financial year, a supple mentary allocation would be required in the IS44/45 financial year.Zol r 3 UGua l allowances for this post have been provided for in r orm e,c-l• CI - . nda 11 stra11 ve Staff It Is hoped that, as from September, 1945, it will be possible to appoint a Supervisor for Persian G-ulf students studying in .airo at schools or universities.

EL Salaries See 'Jotes on Schedule PS2 SCHEDULE PS2 Item A1 In the 1944/46 allocations there was a grant of £1500 for the purpose of subsidising, if necessary, the salaries of Egyptian teachers seconded by the Egyptian Government to Kuwait. The G-overncent of Kuwait has not requested any financial support in this connection, and the aiaries of the teachers are shared equally by the Egyptian G-overnraent and the G-overnment of Kuwait. It is not now anticipatedthat the latter will apply to the Council for financial assistancein this respect. S The Political Resident recently expressed the view that the appointment of a whole-time British Educational Adviser to Kuwait would be premature at this stage, and he has suggested instead the a jpointment of an Egyptian Educational Adviser. Steps are thereforebeing taken in Cairo at present for the selectic of a suitable man on a two-year contract. The Egyptian G-overnmen'i would be expected to contribute 50 per cent, of his salary and it has been suggested by t 1 e Political Resident that the balance should be provided by the British Council. If final approval for the appointment is given the expenditure from the grant under PS2/Ai during the current financial year would be not more than £250, and the recurrent commitment would be £400. A saving of £1250 can therefore be declared on PS2/A1 of the 1944/45 allocation, and the entry in Column 3 of Form EC1 has been adjusted accordingly. —9 • Bahrain 20% No.472/43 26th«October 1944 Prom- Mr.P.J.Wakelin, Educational Adviser Bahrain &amp; Kuwait. bmshfrft rrs'den cy. \ To - The Hon^le the Political Resident \ in the Persian Gulf,Bahrain. Tour N * 3^*.. Date . ' Ci «J V« il I Sir, I have the honour to lay before you,for your consideration, proposals for a hostel in Cairo for students from the Gulf who are studying in Egypt. The problem of staffing the schools of Bahrain and Kuwait can be satisfactorily sloved only by training local men.Apart from the undesirability of importing Arabs from other countries in large numbers the cost is prohibitive,nor could the states concerned afford to employ more than one or two Britishers. During the next ten years a continuous stream of boys must be sent abroad,at first to complete their secondary education and to take a course of pedagogy and later,as our own secondary schools improve,to study at Universities and training colleges. Our immediate needs are for local men with as good a secondary education as can be provided in Arab schools.The choice lies between Iraq,Syria,Palestine,the Sudan and Egypt.The condition of the schools in Iraq is far from satisfactory and Beirut provides only a very superficial education.I know little of Damascus but I feel that the political atmosphere there womld affect our students adversely.Palestine has only one Arab secondary school which is insufficient for its own needs.The field is then narrowed to a choice between the Sudan and Egypt. In the Sudan the most suitable schools are to be found. Living conditions approximate more nearly to those of the Gulf than is so in Egypt.I was most impressed by a party of Sudanese teachers th&amp;t I met this summer in Cairo.But unfortunately there agairjfeccomodation is very limited and the Government is sending large numbers of primary and secondary schoolboys to the Egyptian schools. The Egyptian Government schools are of a good standard, particulary those of Cairo,Helwan,Tanta and Alexandria.The best of the private schools is Victoria College,a branch of which was recently opened in Cairo. The Egyptian Government is ready to take a large number of pupils in their primary and secondary schools but can not provide boarding accomodation.Both primary and secondary education in Egypt is free to all. There are now 20 students from Kuwait and 9 from laahrain in these schools.Of the 29, nine are boarding out and 20 are living in Egyptian Government hostels. Because of the lack of accomodation 28 Kuwait students,who wished to go to Egypt this summer,were refused. In order to make it possible for the necessary number of students to study in Cairo a hostel is needed.Por sometime nowiP S Page 2. I have been urging the British Council to open a hostel for foreign students in Egypt where not only accomodation but also the supervision which is so essential would be provided.The proposal was discussed in Cairo and London but was not accepted as it is considered that such work does not come within the sphere of the Council as defined by the Charter.The Council does however recognise the need for some sort of hostel and is ready to give any assistance in its power.It has been proposed that - as in tne case of other Governments - a house be rented in Cairo and run as a hostel at the expense of the Bahrain and Kuwait Governments.The Council would be ready to provide the salary of a British Warden. Such a hostel would not be merely a boarding house but a cultural centre where students would live an organised life provided with facilities for night classes,lectures,recreation and entertainment. I have been asked to lay the proposals before you,Sir,and to ascertain to what extent the Governments concerned would be ready to provide the necessary funds. It is already an established practice that the Kuwait Education Department sends boys to Egypt,the expenses being paid partly by the Committee and partly by the parents.This year the Bahrain Government has sent 9 students under similar conditions.This number should be increased next year.In both states many parents have approached me saying that they would like to send their boys to Egypt at their own expense if only they were assured of accomodation and adequate supervision.I estimate that Kuwait would send about 50 and Bahrain 30 boys. I am not yet in a position tc^actual figures of costs.I have asked the British Council to make enquiries from the Saudi Arabian, Syrian and Iraqi hostels so that we^form our estimates.In the mean time i will discuss the matter with the Adviser of the Bahrain Government and put the suggestions beforc-the Kuwait Education Committee on my next visit.

Dear Knowles Go.vernment of Bahrain Education Department 13th February 1945. The attached is a copy of my annual report on Boy's Educatior in Bahrain Government Schools, (Non-Technical), for the year 1363. (Roughly 19 -14). I have also sent copies to the Cairo Office. You will see from this report that the foundation of the Bahrain Schools has now been firmly laid and that the time for expansion has come. There is every indication that the time is now ripe to take up once again the question of a Gulf college in Bahrain. What is required is a complete secondary School with a Teachers Training College giving a two years course. As soon as conditions allow the Government will be building a Secondary Boarding School. There should be an English Head Master who is also Assistant Director with an Arab Assistant. Apart from the tv/o. boys from Qatar, (a neighbouring State), and three from Hassa in Saudi Arabia mention d in my report there are at least a dozen others in the Primary Schools who have recently come over from Saudi Arabia to join our schools. The need for education is recognized in that country but parents hesitate to send their boys to Egypt, the nearest centre, as they fear for their morals. A first class school here in Bahrain would serve not only the whole of the Gulf but most of Arabia too. Already our schools have a name in these parts. Before leaving Bahrain I sha^l therefore strongly reconmend that such a scheme be put into practice at the earliest opportunity. ✓ Thank you for your letters p.G./43/l of 5th and 23rd Janu ary 1945.

Re-engagement of Mr.Hutchings and Royalty Gauging. musmCopy of demi-official letter No,447-2E dated 18th February 1945 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agenc, Bahrain. With reference to your D .O.No .C /204 dated 9th February 1945. Hutchings period of service finishes at the end of June. Since Steele left Hutchings has been doing oil gauging as well as looking after the Technical School. On your suggestion I spoke to Anderson about the Technical School and also asked his views about the royalty gauging. He told me that he could not help-in the matter of the Technical School and as regards oil gauging he put up various suggestions to his principals in America. He suggested employing a member of an American or British firm of oil gauging experts, such as Redwoods or transferring someone from Bapco to the Bahrain Government for this duty. If a Redwood man was employed the Bahrain Government would have to bear a large propor tion of his cost and I understand that these experts are very highly paid and it is likely that this firm will not be able to supply the staff. After discussing the matter with Anderson Hutchings informed me that Jie would be willing to remain here for a further two years doing his present duty provided that he could take home leave this summer. Before taking up the matter officially I enquired from Anderson whether it would .suit the Company if Hutchings continued »his work as gauger for another two years. In myepinion it would be more satisfactory if Hutchings were retained for a further two years to under take the work of gauging and at the same time to supervise the work of the Technical School. •• Hutchii^gs. &gt;has acquired a sound knowledge of the gauging work and is a conscientious official and suitable to undertake this duty. .t-cw * ■CONFIDSNTIaL D.0.NO.C/306. Political Agency, Eahraln, lat March 1945a My dear Balgrava, Royalty qauttlog flease refer to your demi-official letter No«447-2E dated Che 18\»h ^obruary. 2. I suggest that the question of the re-engagement of Hutchings for a further two years principally for oil gauging t for the Bahrain Government is scarcely what can be consi dered as a routine matter ana should have been raisea with the Bahrain Petroleum Company in the first instance through this Agency. 3. I have myself discussed the question of oil gauging with Anderson and received the Impression th^t as it is practically impossible for the Bahrain Crovernmenc to obtain a qualified man at the present time the Bahrain Petroleum Company are prepared to accept Huschings for the time being, though I understand that free their point of view it would be more satisfactory to have a properly qualified gauger and inspoctort It would seem to me to bo of the utmost importance that the individual who is employed to watch the interests of t-.he Bahrain Government in the gauging of the oil rrou nhich they receive, in normal times, approxi mately two-thirds of their revenue should be particularly well qualified. Whatever the cost of employing such an expert it would be monoy well spent. I am referring this question to sir Geoffrey Prior and will communicate with you again but before I do so I shall be glad to know what the proposed terms for Hucchings 1 new contract are and whether it is intended th^t he should be granted any «ixtra eaolufaents for the work of gauging and Inspecting.

I have myself recently discussed the question of the Technical School with Anderson. As far as I can ascertain Anderson is very much in favour of taking students straight into the work-shops and giving them individual tuition while actually employed on Company's work. I said that if the Bahrain Petroleum Company were not interested in the work of the Tech nical school either as it is now or as it might be in the future then the Bahrain Government would have to decide whether it was desirable for the Technical School to be continued knowing that the students on finishing their course are unlikely to obtain omployaent in the Oil company. I stated that the Bahrain Government were not in need of financial assistance to continue the-Technical School and that it was entirely a question whether the expenditure would be justified by the results. At the suggestion of HarJia, who was present- during our convorsation, it was decided that no decision would be taken until after the arrival of Hamilton and the Directors of the California Standard Oil Company and the Texas Corporation. You will recollect thac these gentlemen are expected here about the beginning of this month. 3. I am leaving a note for pelly suggesting that he should re-open the question as coon as Hamilton and his companions have left, with a view to discovering whether the Bahrain • Petroleum Company wish to shoulder the responsibility for tech nical education in Bahrain or not. In my own opinion the Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C .B.3., /Technical Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.Technical School should be continued whether or not the Bahrain Petroleuu Company themselves intend to set up a teaching ostablishment to which the general public or some portion of them could be admitted. The school should hov /ever be expanded and b'3 under the direction of a well qualified Technical Director vdth a staff capable of giving first class instruction in mechanical engineering, welding, carpentry, and automobile engineering. yours sincerely, (3d.)

Memorandum on Education in the Schools of the Governments of Bahrain and Kuwait by Mr. F.J, Wakelin. Educational Adviser, Bahrain and Kuwait. I r Apart from the need for educated youths in Government Departments the work of the oil companies in Bahrain, Ki and Eastern Saudia iirabia will absorb all whom we can produce for several years to come. Clerical and tecl trainees are already being sought and the demand will increase as the new production programmes come into action. This expansion of the oil industry will -mean also a general development of trade and the creation of new opportunities for private business. In both Bahrain and Kuwait the demand for education is not yet being fully met. iiny new buildings ©r extensions added in the past four years have been utilised for pupils already at school rather than for new entrants, in the process of reducing the number of children per room to a workable limit. Only in the Lower School are more than 30 children found in one group. New Infant Schools are required at once in both states to reduce this figure still further and to accommodate the 200 or so who are turned away each year through lack of accommodation. This will entail the engagement of additional trained teachers. The work that has been begun in Bahrain and Kuwait is merely the prelude to the development of a coordinated educational system throughout the Gulf and Eastern Saudia Arabia, Within this area there is nothing to compare with the schools of Bahrain or Kuwait except in the Hejoaz. which province is so remote that it can scarcely be included in our sphere. In rapidly increasing numbers boys from Saudia Arabia and other neighbouring states are joining our schools. At present we are able,to provide a sound primary course of seven years and an introduction to a secondary education of three years. 1i 241 -2- -&gt;1* iM, Provided our schools are expanded and our secondary schools well equipped and staffed Saudi itrabians will send their sons to Bahrain or Kuwait rather than to Cairo or Beirut as the 'enviroment in these small Arab states is more suited to their needs. Bahrain already has an excellent hostel which can be extended when necessary. 3teos ta/:en in Kuwait to meet this need , y. The Kuwait Education Comnittee is fully aware of the position and is making preparations for development and expansion. The new infant schools will be opened in September 1945 and 16 more Egyptian masters and mistresses engaged. The Committee intends to set up a hostel in Cairo to house 50 students from Kuwait, the initial cost being £2000 and the running expenses £700 per mensem. These youths will attend schools and colleges in that city. The intention is that most of them will take short courses of one or two years of training as teachers. This will bring about a rapid imp^vement of the local teachers who form the majority of the staff. Foreign teachers will be employed chiefly in the secondary schools and upper classes of the primary schools. These will be gradually replaced by graduates of the Kuwait Secondary School and those already at secondary schools abroad when they have taken a course at a training college either abroad or possibly in Kuwait. i oteps to be taken m Bahrain . Similar action must be taken in Bahrain. A start has been made in that nine students were sent to Egypt in the summer of 1944, three of whom are at a secondary school, three at a teachers training college and three at a technical school. This number should be increased to at least 30 this year. If the Government will set up a hostel(250) ,-.i' -3- ~ | HI many parents will be prepared to send their sons at their own expense. ^ r if Bahrain is to attract suitable foreign teachers and to retain their services better conditions must be provided. The terms of service compare most unfavourably with those of the Kuwait Government. Except for a house allowance of rather less than £2 per mensem, which is only a fraction of the rent of a small house, no provision is made. As is done in Kuwait special quarters must be set aside, or if necessary built. These should be suitable for a married couple as most teachers are married. Salaries should be paid from the date of leaving Egypt and adequate detention allowances should the man be held up on his way to or from Bahrain. Passages for wives are fclso paid to Kuwait employeet Thus their teachers are encouraged to continue their services with the Government over a period of years. All those who have completed their first contract are signing on for another. It is doubtful whether the Egyptians in Bahrain will stay for a second year even. The Director of Education should have a first class Arab Assistant and as soon as the man power problem eases a British Head Llaster for the Secondary School should be appointed. Under present conditions the Director is, among other things. Chief Clerk, Confideritial Typist, Inspector General, Supervisor of English Studies and Adviser to the Kuwait Government. Only in his spare moments can he devote thought to administration and policy, which should be his prime concern. The salary of such an Assistant would be about £1000 per annum plus allowances, half of which would be paid by the Egyptian Government were he seconded by the Ministry of Education. (The salary of the Director of Education, Kuwait is £1000 p.a® plus £400 p.a. allowances, paid half by Kuwait and half by Egypt).7^° British Council ^acl . , The time is not yet ripe to appoint a British Director to Kuwait. The position of the Educational adviser is now satisfactorily established. The only complainit of the Comjidttee is that k±x he is able to devote so little time and attention to Kuwait affairs and can visit them only when his duties in EPahrain permit. They fully appreciate that the to engagement of foreign staff and the placing of students abroad would be extremely difficult without the help of the British Council. That we were able to find so suitable a Director of Education for them was indeed a feather in our cap. It has completely convinced them of our honourable intentions I They know too that they can not open the Cairo Hostel unless the Council undertakes a major part of the work. What they ask for is an Adviser resident in Cairo, where most of their students will be, who can keep in close touch with their boys, engage their teachers and visit them regularly; someone whom they have the right to call upon for advice and assistance rather than a casual visitor who does what he can in the limited time at his disposal. In conclusion I give below a summary of the part the • i British should play. lo Delegate an official in Cairo to continue the work of Educational Adviser to the Kuwait Government and to supervise the Kuwait and Bahrain (?) Hostels in Cairo. 2. Continue the grant to the Bahrain Government and perhaps increase it to cover the Directors full salary when he is enabled, through the appointment of an Arab Assistant, to devote more of his time to administration and policy. 3 0 Second an official as Director of Education for another period of four years•In a year or so increase the grant to cover the salary of a British Head Master for the Secondary School. Nominate a suitable man for this post. CoUM ^ JU X L.H o ^ nl zfl i, _wm 253 CONFIDE 'TIAL GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. D bpabtmint, EXPRESS LETTER [N.

I do not think there is any alternative to Egypt being regarded as the fountain-head from which our educational efforts here must be supplied; and when it is combined with strong infusions from the British Council I think that as little danger as possible to our interests is risked. I approve therefore of the proposals in paragraph 5 to set up a hostel in Cairo. 3. The proposals in paragraph 7 seem reasonable par ticularly as they are in keeping with the universal demand (and need) for extra staff here. 4.

This is at least something because he said that the Shaikh was not sympathetic with 'akelin 1 s other proposals, mainly I think, because he does not want to face the expenditure involved.

TriERE ARE IMPORTiiNT CHANGES IN PROCEDURE FROM THAT OF LAST YEAR AND IT IS ESSENTIAL THAI THIS MEMORANDUM SHOULD BE READ WITH ATTENTION. GENERAL Head 3 of Departments and Representatives abroad are ' j0 receive copies of 'their approved budgets at the beginning of the new financial year; and the Finance Division is equally anxious to bring about this result. Various factors tend to cause delay, some of them purely mechanical (e.g., the difficulty in the mere publication of over one hundred budgets by the Duplicating Section when, as happened last year, its staff was depleted by illness at a time when other urgent demands compete with those of the Finance Division), but a basic cause has been the late arrival of the majority of the estimates, ^• 1^ must be realised that the transformation of the estimates, as.received, into the approved budgets, as finally issued, is a long and complex process. The estimates are first sifted and checked in the Headquarter Division concerned and in the finance Division; they are then examined in con siderable detail by the Budget Committee of the Executive Committee of the Council, for which purpose summaries, with explanatory notes, have to be prepared in the Finance Division: they are next submitted, in a still further summarised form, to the Treasury, the Foreign Office and other Departments of State^concerned, and, after an interval for their examination are discussed at a meeting of representatives of the Council and all these Government Offices: finally, they are minuted on in the Treasury for consideration by the Chancellor of the Exchequer before he decides- the amount of the Grant-in-Aid. This, moreover, is not the end of the story. The Grant-in-Aid approved is always less than that postulated in the estimates submitted to the Treasury. This necessitates , revision and pruning of the estimates by the Budget Committee, for which purpose proposals must be prepared by the Finance^ Division in consultation with the other Headquarter Divisions. It must be remembered, too, that the Budget Committee is com-* posed of eminent and extremely busy people engaged in other work of national importance, so that it is not possible for the Committee to sit lor long hours on consecutive days in order to expedite its work on the estimates, though several of its members made notable personal sacrifices to that end in December last. provide adequate time for the lengthy procedure ^ust described, it has been found necessary to fix an early . aate for the submission of the estimates; and Heads of Departments and Regional Representatives are earnestly requested in their oi/»n interest and in that of the Council as a whole to submit their estimates by or before the dates laid down in this memorandum. For the same reason, they are asked to exercise great care in the preparation of their estimates and the filling- U u ? f'orms. The correction-of errors and omissions involves wholesale alterations of other'items and of totals and so causes much extra work and entails unnecessary delay. •835 sn* PROCEDURE Of REPRESENTATIVES ABROAD ? Representatives, in estimating for the next financial year, should use Schedules E/PS1, E/PS2, E/GSS, E/GSM, E/LFS, E/EXT, Statements E/A, E/BC and Form ECL. Forms EC1 and EC2 will not be used in future. Separate explanatory notes should be attached to each Schedule, Statement and Form. Detailed support of each proposed new post and project should be supplied and any major divergencies from the current financial year in expenditure on an existing activity should be explained. The Schedules, Statements and Form, each with its explanatory notes, must be despatched in triplicate in time to reach the London Office as soon as possible after 1st.September and at the very latest by 1st October . Personnel Basic salaries, gross salaries, part salaries and supplements to salaries of whatever kind should be entered on Schedules E/PS1 and E/PS2. It should be noted that posts are to be budgeted for and not individuals. In the case of London Appointed staff, the average basic salary of the grade of the post should be entered, except in the case of the Repre sentative, whose actual basic salary should be entered. In the case of Locally Appointed staff, proposed increments should be included at the full yearly rate. The column headed 'Subsidy' is for entering the supplements to salaries, paid by the Council, as opposed to posts contracted and fully paid by the Council which should be entered in the column headed 'Basic Salary' or 'Gross Salary'. Marriage allowance should be entered on Schedule E/PS1 as an average total for the country. It is calculated as one-tenth of the total of the average basic salaries of Grade II posts plus one-eighth of the total of the average basic salaries of Grades III and IV posts. Local allowance should be entered on Schedule E/PS1 as an average total for the country. It is calculated by applying the local allowance rate for the country to the total of the average basic salaries of all London Appointed staff and to the marriage allowance as calculated in paragraph 5 above. Entertainment allowance should be entered on Schedule E/PS1 as the total of all gross entertainment allowances paid to officials as part of their emoluments, for entertainment in their homes by virtue of the representa tional responsibility of their posts, and should be supported by the detailed Statement E/A. Block grants for public entertainment should be entered under 'Entertainment? 1 on Schedule E/GSM (Maintenance). Travelling expenses and sub sistence allowances for officials travelling \ itbin the country should be entered under 'Travelling, Subsistence, Transport, Insurance' on Schedule E/GSM (Maintenance). Special entertainment allowances (in respect of high rentals) should be entered on Schedule E/PS1 as the total of all such allowances as are in force at the time of submission of the estimates and should be supported by the detailed Statement E/A # General Services Any service which is general to the country and cannot included under any of the Local Kmctional Services should P.T.O. s- 2 - 10, 11. 12. 15. be entered as a separate item under 'Various General Services' on bchedule E/GSS e .g.. Leave allowance, staff conventions and urses, meaical services, etc. Local scholarships are con sidered to be a general service and should be entered &lt;n detail under 'Students' on Schedule E/GSS. Maintenance (Schedule E/GSM) should not includ° s ^ 1 ® r f?®. or wa S es of.any kind. The sub-division 'Maintenance buildings and 6(.|uipni6ntis intsndod to covor small recurrent i^enis of repair, replacement and renovation, but not ^ is kind, which should be entered on Schedule h/bXi under 'Building and reconstruction' or 'Furniture and equipment'. bubsidies (Schedule S/GSS) should never be calculated on a scale to permit an institution to build up a reserve by virtue of Council funds, but should be the sums estimated i;o be necessary to cover the yearly deficits sub- jectto any maximum which has been laid down. Subsidies are for institutions not under Council control. Expenditure on those fully controlled by the Council should be entered on Scnedules E/PS1, E/PS2 and E/GSM. Local Functional Services . i ^ J ' s sub-heading refers to the expenditure on functional Services incurred and controlled in a country and should be entered on Schedule E/LFS. Local expendi ture on Fine Arts and Book exhibitions emanating from London is a charge on the London budgets and should not be estimated for.^ Distribution costs of material such as Films and Publications are not a Local Functional Service but should be entered under the appropriate sub-division of the Maintenance of the office (Schedule E/GSM). Extraordinaries 77 THIS sub-heading refers to all capital and definitely non-recurrent expenditure (inclndine: non recurrent subsidies ^ to insti tutions, which are distinguished shonlri e h Urre ? subsidies by being termed subventions) and. should be entered on Schedule E/EXT. tm 14. 15. 16. London Services On Form ECL should be entered the requirements Ox the country for the supply from London of books and of periodicals. The scholarships to Great Britain to be offered m the coming year --.dll already have formed the subject of correspondence between the Representative and the Director of the Students Department in London. Services required from other functional departments in London should not be entered on Form ECL. The Representative should have already indicated such requirements in correspondence with the Directors of the various departments. Column A . ^ Orl^nai pi w*.M 0 ns.mean the allocations as set out in the original approved budget for the current financial year • Column B 'Revised expenditure' means the original allocation plus any supplementary allocation; plus any sum vired to the i em^ minus any savings declared; minus any sum vired from the item, all in accordance vlth the Forms B, V and S received by the Representative up to the time of submission of the estimates. In addition, if the Representative at this time foresees any further definite savings, or if he has declaredany further savings in. respect of v ;hich ht hc.s not received Forms S, he should deduct these in Column B anc, at tne same time, declare them in full detail against tne appropriate schedule items in his explanatory notes on the estimates. Column C If a post for which provision was included in the original allocations has teen uniiiled ^or part 01 the year or even if it is anticipated that it v:ill remain unfilled for the whole yearj the full yearly salary and allowances should be entered in Column C unless the proposal to establish the post in the coming financial year has dready been definitely abandoned. Similarly, if a pest has been created during the year and a supplementary allocation approved sufficient to cover the re maining period of the year, the full yearly salary and allow ances should be entered in Colunn C. In short, Column C should show the frll yearly salaries and allowances of all posts, filled or unfilled, which havs been approved at the time of sub mission of the estimates. It may be pointed out again, tnat with London Appointed staff, basic salaries and local and marriage allowances are always calculated, lor purposes of yearly rates, supplementaries and savings, on the average system as described in paragraphs 4, 5 an d 6, and the actual emolu ments of officials should be ignored, even when calculating over and under expenditure. The same principle applies to subsidies, maintenance and other general services. If the subsidy or maintenance provision for an approved institution has not been used in full because the institution las not opened until part way through the year, although Column B will show a smaller figure than Column A, Column C will be identical with Column A; or if a_ subsidy or maintenance provision is approved for an institution during the course of the year Column B will show the supple mentary allocation to cover the remaining period of the year, but Column C will show the full yearly rate of the supplementary allocation. Column D In column D .should be entered the total estimated expenditure for the coming financial year, including all pro posed new posts and projects, at the full annual rate for recurrent expenditure and the full amount for non-recurrent expenditure. Receipts Receipts should be entered in detail on Statement E/BC. Correspon dence with_Lpndon In 1945/46 the gross budget of the Council has already passed the four million mark. It will be appreciated that the checking, consideration and presentation of a budget of this size, comprising over one hundred individual budgets and thousands of items, entails a very great volume of work for the London staff It would, therefore, be of great assistance if Representatives would endeavour to secure that requests for approval of new projects and general correspondence with London cf all kinds are reduced to an absolute minimum during the months of October, November and December. It is of equal importance that omissions and errors in the estimates should be avoided. Last minute adjustments, even if the- amounts are negligible, involve, each time, the alteration of scores of totals and consequently a great amount of labour in cross-checking.

You will by now have received the letter from the London Office of the British Council PG/6/l(6-6) of 4th July, in which it is stated that the Budget Sub-Committee would not agree to the recommend ation for a Supervisor under Item C.l of the Estimates for 1946/46. I have forwarded a copy of your Express letter to London, with a request for reconsideration of this decision, but I fear that the present financial year, in which the Council 1 is being pressed for many new commitments in Europe, is unfavourable to any expansion in our Middle East budgets. Yours sincerely. Sd/-T.S.R.Boase. Chief Representative of the British Council in the Near and Middle East. m The Political Residerit, Persian Gulf Residency, Bushire. 1 -•••■Items A.1 and B.l, No comment. Item C.l. Please see the reference to this appointment in the explanatory notes. This proposal has been initiated wholly by the Council^ and in our comments we may say that the Bahrain/Kuwait Governments are not likely to maVe provision for a separate • hostel in Cairo for the few students there. KUWAIT. ?.R. did not mention anything about an Egyptian Educational Adviser in S.77 of file 53/83. but this is apparently the appointment referred to in the 5th para, of Mr. Wakelin 1 i report at p. 176 ibid. From prepage. 23/10/44. R '9 Bahrain ——- '• /akelln informed me that he has illy ' eaSOn t0 belleve that both the Kuwait and Bahrain Governments would be prepared to contribute to the running and maintenance of a hostel in Cairo. He has promised to let us have a note on the subject. Kuwait ; : '■ !r • '• Yakelln stated this morning that— Sir Geoffrey Prior had agreed to the appoint ment of the Egyptian Educational Adviser while he was in Kuwait last year Y 26-10-44.If 19/248 Mr. Wakelin came to see me this morning. There appear, to be three points outstanding (a) Hostel in Egypt, (b) Payment for Egyptian Director in Kuwait (c) Replacement for Mr. Wakelin. As regards (a) it is agreed that he will write confirming that Bahrain and Kuwait Governments agree 9 and in the meantime I will do some propaganda with the Shaikh of Kuwait. (b) It seems clear from S.79 (of which a copy should have been forwarded to Mr. Wakelin) that the Council have made up their minds to pay at the rate of £400 per annum for an Egyptian Director in Kuwait. We should confirm this by telegram and then tell Kuwait. It will be a useful peg on which to hang a British Educational Adviser when Kuwait is better off. (c) Mr. Wakelin is asking the Bahrain Government to arrange accommodation for his successor. As the State pay nothing there is no reason why they or we should object. 2. It remains to approve S.79. I understand the projector was sunk on the way out. 3. S.64. The matter is in hand. 4. S»56. P.A. has not discussed this with the Company but thinks they will view it favourably, though they may say they can't take it up till after the War. He has mentioned it to the Adviser who was not enthusi astic. Mr. Hatchings 1 agreement terminates in May and I will recommend the proposal to the St^te in a con solidated programme for improvement I am going to send them. 1 ' L lCv* * /j i K .
