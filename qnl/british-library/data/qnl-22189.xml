No. 49 L■ mmm COPY ,v SECRET British Middle East Office, Cairo 5th February, 1947 Dear Hay, This is in reply to your D.0.No.95-S of the 15th January about At, Sullivan. He is on the diplomatic list here and is described as 'Attache Adjoint (questions Petrolieres) u , his appointment dating, from April, 1946. I gather that in normal life he was an accounts clerk, or something of the kind, in one of the American oil companies and after the war was appointed as assistant to the then American Oil Attache, a senior man by the name of Pagett. Pagett has since faded out but Sullivan has stayed on. The general impression 1 ga,ther is that he is carving out a job for himself by asking a lot of questions from anybody he can get hold of, compiling statistics and, to be frank, making a general nuisance of himslef. It would be unwise to trust him too far but, on the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that he is vicious or harmful. He is a hail-fellow- well-met type of man who goes in a good deal for social functions On the whole, 1 should say that he should be treated with a certain amount of reserve but handled tactfully. Yours sincerely, (Signed) A. Overton Colonel W.R. Hay, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. SnCRuT D.0.bo.95-S PEnSlArl G'JLF AH.5IDBPCY, BAHRAIN, the 15th January, 1947 !

He stated his intention of returning here shortly when he hopes to^ interview Packer, the local Petroleum Concessions Limited Manager, and also to visit the iruciai Coast and find out what Petroleum Concessions Limited are doing there. k* I should be grateful for anything you can let me know accut Sullivan. J gather he made himself rather unpopular with the American Manager of the BaPCO here and I think we may find him a bit of a nuisance, as however he was introduced to me oy Childs I propose to give such assistance in the way of travel facilities as is possible and any information about oil developments which is not of a highly confidential nature.
