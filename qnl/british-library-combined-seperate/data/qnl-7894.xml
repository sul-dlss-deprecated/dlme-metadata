Much of the correspondence discusses British concerns regarding the possibility of oil being discovered in the Ruba' al Khali [Rubʻ al Khālī], and the bearing that such a discovery might have on the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. Also discussed are the prospect of Petroleum Concessions Limited securing an oil concession for territory in the Ruba' al Khali, and the extent of the territory covered in the concession secured by the Standard Oil Company of California in 1933.The file features the following principal correspondents: His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Reader William Bullard); Major Stephen Hemsley Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Limited; officials of the Foreign Office, the India Office and the Admiralty.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Ruba' al Khali</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Oil</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002b2#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002b2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
