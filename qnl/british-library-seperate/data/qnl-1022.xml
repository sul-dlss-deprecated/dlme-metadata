In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted by the British Government to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in WW1.The correspondence discusses in detail a number of cases in the Iraqi courts regarding the gardens (by that time owned by the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ) and attempts made by British officials in Iraq and Kuwait to mediate between the two sides. In the correspondence, British officials discuss whether or not the British Government should compensate Shaikh Aḥmad for the amount of tax he had been forced to pay by the Government of Iraq and exactly what area of land was covered by the 1914 promise. More broadly, the correspondence is focused on how the disagreement can be settled permanently and whether an agreement incorporating border demarcations and anti-smuggling measures could form a part of any final settlement between Kuwait and Iraq.The file contains correspondence regarding the hiring of an Egyptian lawyer to assist in compiling the defence for Shaikh Aḥmad. Two Egyptian lawyers are discussed and hired: Tewfik Doss Pasha [Tawfīq Doss[?] Bāshā] and Ahmed Rushidi Bey [Aḥmad Rashīdī Bey].
