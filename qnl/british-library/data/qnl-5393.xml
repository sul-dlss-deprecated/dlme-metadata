A sum of Rs. 3400/- was therefore budgetted every year under C.2. Pay ol Establishment Sistan Consulate. 2. In the year 1931-32, an economy was effected owing to a favourable rate of exchange between ILrans and Rupees. The pay of the dak sowars was fixed in local currency and a sum of Hs.1500/- out of Rs. 3400/- was surrendered to Government. In the retrenchment scheme, the sum of Rs.1500/- was permanently surrendered to Government. Three dak sowars at Rs. 20/- each were retrenched and the strength and the provision ol dak sowars were fixed at 9 men and Rs. 1900/— per aiuium.

In view of the fact that a courier system has now been started fortnightly for our mails to be carried to India and Tehran, it has not been possible for me to engage extra couriers in addition to these dak sowars who run on camels between Zabul and Zahidan only. As the engagement of extra couriers would have involved further expenditure# in order to effect economy# I have dispensed with seven dak sowars with effect from 1st December 1934 keeping one Jemadar and one sowar at the reduced rates of pay in case of emergency i.e*# motor service failing between Zahidan and Zabul and have substituted four couriers instead to run by Motor lorries between Zabul-Zahidan- Birjand-Meehed and vice-versa.

From the above it will appear that no extra expenditure will be involved by substituting couriers for carriage of mails by hired motor lorries in lieu of dak sowars who used to carry mails on camels and that between Zabul and Zahidan only. The provision of Rs«l90o/- has remained unaffected under the office allowance grant but the strength of the dak establishment has been reduced from 9 men to 6 men. Though this change has taken place in my office allowance contract grant establishments' which are under my direct control financially' I consider it necessary to inform the Government of India of this change and to request that if formal sanction to this change is necessary' it may kindly be conveyed. 6• X may also mention here that to provide a connecting link of couriers with Tehran* the Secretary to His Britannic Majesty 9 s Cohaul General for Hhoraaan is temporarily' for the Remainder of this financial year only* maintaining two couriers between Meshed-Tehran and vice versa and the chargee are met by him from his own funds debi table to the Military Departmen U 1 understand that the Secretary has insufficient funds to continue payment of these two men next year. It ie highly desirable that we should have a single system throughout Saet Persia and the scheme is rendered ineffective if there are no couriers between Meshed and Tehran. 1 therefore beg to request that the Office Allowance9 © Allowance for couriers (previously Ask sowers) under this Consulate General be increased for next year by the sua of Hs. 800/- to neet the cost of these two couriers (2 couriers ** at Rials 200/- each J?.M. or Rials 4800/- per annuls Rs.800/- at Rials 600£)* As however the couriers running throughout Seat Persia are largely used by the Secretary on behalf of the Military Department, 1 would suggest that the Army Departroent might reasonably be asked to contribute to the Political Department funds 1/3 of the total cost of running couriers which would be l/3 of Re*2700/- i*e* Rs.900/ 4 * per annum* If this can be arranged the necessity for reference to the Secretary of State for India for the inceease of Rs*800/- per annum under our contract grant would not occur, and time is an important factor, for we do not wish the system to break down at the end of the financial year and a reference to the Secretary of State would involve great delay* The final proposals therefore arei- 1.

Memorandum No.F. 165-A/35, f ** Dated Simla, the ^ August 1935.'? Proposed increase in the Khorasan and Zahidan office allowance grants owing to fluctuation of exchange. --XXXX-- Reference correspondence ending with your express letter No. 728/A/10 dated the 18th June 1935. 2. In order to meet the position due to the fluctuation in the Rial exchange, the Government of India have had under consideration the following alternative proposals (a) Fixation of a portion of the office allowance grants in the local currency without reference to any fixed or fluctuating exchange rate, (h) Drawal of the office allowance grants at a fixed rate of Rials 600 to Rs. 100 - the office allowance in rupee terms remaining as at present, the difference on account of exchange being adjusted by the Accountant General, Central Revenues, under *L*ss by exchange* and (c) The continuance of the existing system of sanctioning increases in the office allowance grants in terms of rupees on account of fall in exchange, if and when there is an abnormal fall in the value of the rupee currency. 3. After careful consideration the Government of India have decided that the existing practice, i.e. the proposal at 2(c) above, should continue, particularly as it appears that the exchange position is improving. It is therefore, requested, 9 . . .requested that the exchange position for the current financial year as a whole may he reviewed in December next and proposals for an increase in the office allowance grants, if considered necessary, may be forwarded to the Govemment of India in due course, 4. From your telegram No. 29 dated the 18th June 1935 to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, it seems that you have already overdrawn the office allowance grant for the first quarter of the current year. The Govemment of India are pleased to regularise this overdrawal, but this should not be construed as an authority for further overdrawals or for an increase in the grants fixed for the current year without sanction.

The Khorasan Office Allowance grant (which was Based on exchange 600 Rials - 100 Rupees) is 34,700 Rupees. Out of which Rupees £9,200 is spent in Rials and the balance is paid in Rupees (and therefore does not fluctuate)* Taking an average exchange of Rials 500 - 100 Rupees (although actual for past quarter has been 463 = 100 Rupees as shown above) the amount necessary to make up the difference between Rupees £9,200 ® 600&gt; and the same at 500&gt; will amount to Rupees 6000 (in round figures). If the Government of India be pleased to fix the minimum rate of exchange for pay of Office Allowance Establishment at 600&gt;i«, Rupees 26 00 will be required against loss by exchange (Rial Compensation) for pay of Office Allowance Establishments ana an increase in the Office Allowance proper of Rupees 3400/- will be necessary to meet other payments in Rials, the Rial having depreciated from 600a (on which the Office Allowance was based) to 500£. 2. On the other hand if the Government of India desire to avoid the permanent increase of 3400/- in the Office Allowance grant, and would be pleased to fix a minimum exchange rate of 6QQfr for all payments from the Office Allowance (excluding payments of about Rupees 5500 which are made in rupees) then a total sum The average rate of exchange for the last 1of Rupees 6000 will need to be provided for Rial Compensat ion. 3. Alternatively if it be not desired to fix the minimuia rate of exchange at 600# either for pay of establishment or for other expenses then the Office Allowance grant should be increased by Rupees 6000&gt; or finally a fixed rate of 600# for all Office Allowance expenditure would meet the case* any necessary adjust ments for exchange being made by the Accountant General, Central Revenues in India. 4. In this connection I would point out that the Khorasan Office allowance was revised when the Khorasan- Sistan amalgamation scheme took place and very heavy reductions were made on the assumption that the rate would not fall much below 600# • there is therefcre no room for economies to meet so heavy a loss by exchange, such as may exist elsewhere in larger administrations* with much greater funds at their disposal. Zahidan Vice Consulate The same remarks apply to this Office Allowance grant which is Rupees 5900. Here the total deficiency will befis.llOO-of which Rupees 700 will be required as Rial Compensation in respect of pay of Office Allowance establishment and Rupees 400/- increase in Office Allowance for other Rial payments. 6.

With reference to foreign and Political department Memorandum Mo. P.284-A/29, dated the 4th december 1929, I have the honour to state that since 1924 when the Financial control of the Vice-Consulate duzdap, was transferred to oisfran, the question of Office Allowance system of the Vice- Consulate duzdap, has not been taken up for consideration. It has been presumed from time to time that the office allow ance of the duzdap Vice-Consulate was on a contract basis, as is the case in all Consulates in Persia and the Persian Gulf, the accounts of which are under the control of the Government of India. Consequently it was assumed that sanctions given by His Majesty^ Consul Sistan, being the controlling officer, were sufficient to cover all petty expenditure, normally felling under 'Office How nee' charges. For a long period, no objections with regard to small expenditure on liveries etc were raised by the Accountant General, Central Revenues, Mew delhi. The original grant under contingencies was Rs.2000/- which was subsequently raisedraised to Rs. 5300/- on account of additional expenditure on Menial Establishment and the cost of medical stores etc for the Duzdap dispensary. 2 . In addition to the temporary establishment maintained under M Office Allowance' grant, there is a budget provision of Rs. 600/- under 'Pay of Establishments' for 1 Bahisti at Rs« 30/- per mensem and one peon at Rs. 20 /- per mensem, ihe allotment of Rs. 5300/- under 'Office Allowance' includes o expenditure on 'Telegram^ and Postage Charges 1 and it is found that the average annual expenditure under this head at normal times amounts to Rs. 600/-. As the expenditure under 'Postage and Telegram Charges' i s an auditable expendi ture, the whole grant of Rs. 5300/- is apparently considered by the ccountant General, Central Revenues, to be auditable at present. 3 . In this connection, X would submit that Duzdap is the only Consulate in Persia or the Persian Gulf which has not the 'Office Allowance' system of Accounts, *~e. the contract grant system, and as expenditure under certain heads such as liveries, office contingencies, furniture etc. owing to fluctuations in transport rates, Persian customs dues and taxes etc, cannot be definitely fixed for any reasonable length of time, but the reasonableness of such charges can, having regard to the circumstances of the time, be checked by His Majesty* s Consul, Sistan, the Controlling Officer, it would seem undesirable and a c^u/Sse of unnecessary correspondence and delay, if His Majesty’s Consul Sistan, is obliged to constantly approach the Government of India for sanction to petty expenditure on liveries etc as is at present insisted upon by the Accountant General, Central Revenues. 4. X, therefore beg to submit that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction huzdap Vice-Consulate 'Office Allowance' grant to be a contract grant and that all expenditure incurred under this grant should be subject to the sanction of His Majesty’s Consul, Histan and Kain, a thusthus bringing JJuzdap into line with all other Consulates, including Sist&amp;n Consulate, in which, we have at present the anomaly of one system of accounts for Consulate Headquarters and another for the Vice-Consulate, subordinate to it. 5. This will necessitate the transfer of expenditure on 'Telegram and Postage' from 'Office /llowance” to Contin gencies 'Telegram and Postage Charges' and the addition of Rs. 600/- to the 'Office Allowance' on account of 'Pay of menial establishment' at present budgetted under 'Pay of Establishments'. The expenditure under 'Office Allowance' should therefore be reduced by Ks* 600/- on account of 'Postage and Telegram charges' and be increased by Rs. 600/- account of pay of Menial Establishment. Thus the provision under 'office Allowance' will remain at Rs* 6300 /- and the detailed heads will be as under:- &amp; as. p Pay of E s tab li shmen t 1,800 0 0 Hooks and Periodicals 150 0 0 Office Contingencies 250 0 0 Hot &amp; Cold weather charges 200 0 0 Eurniture 300 0 0 Li veri es 400 0 0 Repairs to buildings 500 0 0 Touring 100 0 0 medical stores 1,000 0 G Garden Contingencies 100 0 c Lighting 200 0 1 sc ellaneous 300 0 Total. 5,300 CL sap These detailed heads of the Contract grant will be subject to increase and decre&amp;se at the discretion of His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, provided that the total expenditure does not exceed the allotment. 6 . It is requested, therefore, that one detailed head under 'Contingencies' for the 'Postage and Telegram' charges for Rs* 600/- may be opened and the detailed head 'Pay of Servants' under 'Pay of Establishments' may be deleted. 7. with regard to the 'Office Allowance' under the Trade Assistant’s budget i.e* Account I - Political gents, the total is Rs. 900/-* Of this a sum of Rs. 300/- may be set apartapart as an auditable grant under 'Post^e and Telegram” Charges while the balance of Rs* 600/- be made a contract grant, expenditure being subject to control of his -ajesty’s Vice-Consul Duzdap, super*!sed by His Majesty's Consul, Sistan, as Controlling Officer.
