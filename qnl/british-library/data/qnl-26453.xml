Why^the new council is to be called the Higher Council of State is not made clear. There is ‘at present a Legislative Assembly, and a standing committee of the Council of Ministers. The Legislative Council seems to deal only with administrative, never with political, questions.

Our readere are avare that His Majesty the King is accu stoned to call a general meeting every year at the tine when crowds of people come to see him at Riyadh. Sometimes reports of this annual conference have heen published, some times not. This year the conference was held about the middle of Rabi* al Awwal (about mid-May). It was attended by the amirs of the royal family, the ulana, important officials and thinking men. His Majesty the King, who presided over the conference, reviewed the home and foreign situation, and explained to all present the need for caution and watchfulness, and for the adoption of such preparations as are commanded by the uran. His Majesty also set forth the necessity to consider two matters for the maintenance of the state internally and externally. The first is the establishment of a Higher Council of State, to be constituted in accordance with a special law, to consider public affairs touching the state and its preserv ation. The second is the examination of the Military organisation and the replacement of the present system by a new one whereby the forces in Nejd may become more useful and effectual. This can only be effected by giving troops a scientific training in special barracks so that there may (always) be under training some tens of thousands of men (ready) to move at the order of their commander-in-chlef in any direction, supported hy the reserve forces In the country. His/Hie Majesty stated that he had only been prevented from putting this proposal into effect earlier by the ehortage in the state revenue, and that, believing that this financial crisis would now be resolved by the revenue to be expected from economic resources in this country, he thought it necessary to hurry on with the business. His Majesty's statements were received by all with delight and Joy, and his proposals were unanimously supported and approved. His Majesty therefore issued orders for the necessary preparations to be made to put the two schemes into effect.

Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received June 20.) (No. 110.) ' Lord, Jedda, May 31, 1938. AN article published in the Umm-al-Qnra of the 20th May suggests that Ibn Saud is not unaware of the criticism to which his regime is subjected in the Hejaz. I he article is entitled : “ The present situation in the Hejaz. as people see it and as the fair-minded admit it to be.” It reproaches those who complain because the Hejaz has not become the wonder of the world in a moment. They make the mistake of comparing this country with certain other countries, instead of comparing the country as it is now with what it was a short while ago. Important changes for the better have been effected : (1) Public security has been established everywhere; this is the most important improvement, since it affects the lives and property of pilgrims; (2) public health is cared for by a sufficiency of doctors, with an abundance of medical stores; (3) transport is now effected easily by comfortable cars, and distances which formerly took ten days are now covered in one; (4) everything possible is now done for the comfort of pilgrims and the comfort, progress and prosperity of the citizens in the matter of develop ment. culture, morality and public order. What a contrast to the state of affairs which existed until the recent past, when the country had never seen a motor car or an aeroplane, and did not even know what security was! Any fair-minded person who compares the present of the Hejaz with the past must admit that remarkable results have been achieved by the Government of His Majesty the King. But some people are never satisfied, and cannot see that the Hejaz is progressing normally with the greatest possible speed. The thing to be done is to pray for success, and not to cavil about small defects which are inevitable, and to expect perfection. 2. So far as the question of public security goes, the complacency of the article is justified, and it is also true that the Hejaz public do not realise what that involves. In some other respects, however, the Hejazi malcontent could produce valid retorts to the claims advanced on behalf of the Hejaz Government. It is true that a considerable number of doctors have been imported, but their professional skill is often doubtful, and the assertion that they are provided with an abundance of medical stores is an absurd overstatement. Nor would any of the pilgrims I have seen admit that transport in the Hejaz is comfortable. It is true that motor transport has been introduced, but almost nothing has been done to make roads suitable for it. It is one of the strangest lapses in the record of Ibn Sand’s Government, that the short stretch of 45 miles between here and Mecca remains very much as it was when Ibn Saud occupied the Hejaz over twelve years ago. . .. 3. ’ The article naturally makes no reference to the main Hejazi grievance, viz., that the Hejaz would be in much better case than it is if it had not to support the rest of Arabia besides paying for its own administration. This grievance overlooks the fact that, during the only period for centuries when the He.iaz tried to live as a separate unit, i.e., under King Hussein, it failed not onh in defence against aggression from outside, but also m the maintenance of internal order It may be that if the budget of Saudi Arabia were published it would be found that public security, including the maintenance of order among the tubes by means of subsidies, swallows up most of the revenue and^ consequenUy since nublic security matters much more to the Heiaz, with the pilgum tiattic as its one indusuy thmi to the rest of the country, tW a better case could be made out for the Saudi Administration than the Hejazi is ptepa'ed ‘o a . th^ absence of figures however, the Hejazi will continue to think that he is heece for the benefit of the Nejdi. and, in particular, for the support ot an extiavag, and much too numerous Royal family.

Section 1. Copy No. bir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received May 27.) (No. 83 E.) My Lord, Jedda, April W), 1938. i. m\ despatch ISo. 38 E. dated the 11th March. 1937, I had the honour to submit some comments on the financial situation of Ihn Saud and its effect upon po icy. Attei the lapse of a year I offer some remarks to bring that despatch up to date. 1 he details of the economic and financial side of Saudi administration ha\e &gt;een gi\en in the Economic Report for 1937, which was forwarded under covei of mv despatch No. 74 E. dated the 17th April, and it is not my intention to repeat them here, but to examine the situation in a broader aspect. 2. I he Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate are sufficiently satisfied with the supplies of water which they have discovered to continue working with energy tow ards the exploitation of the gold mine at Mabd^al-Dhahab. They feel, however, that the importance which their enterprise formerly held in Saudi eyes has- greatly diminished since the discovery of oil in Hasa in considerable quantities, in view of the vastly greater royalties to be expected if the hopes which are being built upon the Hasa oil-held are realised. According to a statement made to me recently by the acting manager, a net profit from the gold-mine of about £50.000 a year would mean a satisfactory profit for the syndicate, but the corresponding royalties would not make very much difference to the Saudi budget. 3. The revenue obtained from the pilgrimage being irregular, and depending upon delicate political, economic and social factors which far transcend the hol ders of this country, the only hope of a considerable and permanent increase in revenue is in oil. It is not surprising, then, that, when No. 7 well in Hasa began to yield oil at a rate which eventually increased to something like 900 tons a day, the Saudi Royal family and officials began to make eager calculations as to the revenue to be expected from royalties. To a Government wffiich raises revenue from subscriptions, from such devices as taxing sheep and camels at so much a head, or most invidiously by squeezing visitors to the House of Allah, the prospect of just sitting still and collecting about a pound sterling for every 3 tons of oil that flows out of the earth is naturally attractive. Rut what the revenue from that source will amount to is still a matter of pure speculation. I have made a rough calculation, and I find that, if Hasa proved to be as rich in oil as Bahrein, the Saudi Government might draw about £350,000 a year in royalties, and that this annual sum might increase to £1.200,000, or to £1,900,000. or to £2,500.000, if Hasa proved to be as rich in oil as Iraq. Mexico or Iran respectively. 4. While no one can say what the extent of the oil-field in Hasa is. it seems reasonable, on the evidence of No. 7 well, to conclude that oil revenue will form an item of importance in the Saudi budget, and therefore to speculate on the effect it will have on Saudi policy. The belief of this Legation, that Ibn Saud must regret the invidious necessity which compels him to raise most of his revenue by taxing pilgrims, was borne out recently, when 8heikh \usuf ^ asin informed me that, if the oil in Hasa produced a considerable revenue, the King's first care would be to reduce the charges which he was at present obliged to levy on pilgrims in order to subsidise the tribes for the maintenance of order. I can believe that this benevolent intention exists in Ibn Saud s mind, but I am doubtful whethei a reduction in pilgrim dues will be the first charge upon the revenue to be obtained from oil, for there will be many rival objects claiming attention, from military defence to private extravagance. It would take a considerable sum to accumulate such a reserve as would enable the Saudi Treasury to avoid the ruinous devices which it at present adopts from time to time to raise ready money, y'.y., t e purchase of goods in Jedda in exchange for orders exempting future consignments from customs dues, and their sale for cash down. Then the King could spend a large sum on defence, and probably anything up to £100,000 on the restoration [305 dd—1]x 2 of the Hejaz Railway, not to mention roads and other public works which have Ions been under discussion. ... * . i . 5. The question of private extravagance deserves a paragraph to itself. I have mentioned it before as the least admirable side of baudi rule. A &gt; audi fault which is even admitted by Mr. Philby must be serious. It is not unfair to say that in all probability one of the first charges on tj 16 re\enue from oil will be the acquisition of more motor cars and more women. Ibn baud has the traditional o-enerosity of the Arab sheikh, and the number of expectant beneficiaries is enormous. Each of the young princes, and each other Saudi dignitary of importance, is the centre of a smaller circle of extia\agance, and the total \\a.ste must be immense. Last year the Legation were requested to piowde the (jiand Chamberlain with a letter of recommendation to the authorities in India, where he was ^oin^ on the King’s business. His business was to buy stuffs for the ladies of the Royal household, and the information I have obtained that he spent some £50 000 on this purpose is not difficult to believe, the more so as he and his assistant both travelled to India by air on their mission. When Ibn Saud travelled from Mecca to Riyadh after the pilgrimage, with ms followers and his ladies, his convov consisted of 558 motor vehicles. Now it is not to lie supposed that the extravagance, of wEIch I have given two out of many stinking examples, will stop just there, and will not grow with growing opportunities, and the clamour of family and hangers-on for more money and more presents may well drown at first the protests of pilgrims against over-taxation. I hope that my scepticism will prove to be unjustified, but, apart from the existence of competing claims, it must be remembered that to make an appreciable reduction in pilgrim dues would cost a large sum of money. It is calculated that the third-grade Indian pilgrim, who uses the cheapest form of transport, viz., the camel, spends about £30 on the pilgrimage from start to finish, even if he does not go to Medina. A reduction of £1 would not make a great difference to his totaf bill, whereas an all-round reduction of the charges on overseas pilgrims by £1 would cost the Saudi Treasury over £60,000 in a season like that of 1937-38. 6. However, although pilgrims are not likely to have the first call on any increase in revenue, if the increase is considerable, they will certainly get a share. Now the less the pilgrim pays in fixed charges for taxation and transport the more money he is likely to spend in the Hejaz in other ways, to the profit of those elements whose traditional perquisites have been so sadly cut down in recent years. The Hejaz has been accustomed to have its own revenue supplemented, not to have to supplement that of other provinces. The Turks spent more in the Hejaz than they took out of it. but the Hejazis were parasites long before that— in the days when a considerable part of the spoils of the early Arab conquests flowed down towards Mecca and Medina. It is conceivable that Xejd and its dependencies may become the richer half of Saudi Arabia, and that the Hejazi will decide that the interests of the Hejaz lie in union, not in separation. 7. In my despatch No. 78 dated the 24th April I considered the various sources from which trouble might perhaps come at the death of Ibn Saud. These considerations might be affected fundamentally if a considerable and steady revenue were forthcoming from oil in Hasa. Not only might the Hejaz be kept in a state of tolerable contentment, but the task of maintaining order among the tribes by the regular distribution of subsidies would be facilitated. Thus the oil revenue should be a factor making for stability and for an undisputed succession upon the death of Ibn Saud. It is not only the amount of the oil revenue, but the method of payment that would be of importance. The main item of re\ enue at present has to be collected through officials from a large number of individuals over a period of several months, but the oil royalties can be paid into a bank in another country, out of reach of all except those whose signatures aie leoognised by the bank, there is in Riyadh a Treasury to which it is said that onh Ibn Saud and the Amir Saud have keys, but a treasury can be seized and its contents distributed on the spot. A banking account in a foreign countrv is much less vulnerable. 8 . These speculations might be affected by the discovery of oil in the Farsan Islands in commercial quantities, but that seems to be a remote contingency. 9.

He considers that £700,000 gold is a reasonable estimate for the revenue from other sources than the customs for the year 1356 A.H. (roughly 1937-38), but he does not believe that the customs at Jedda can bring in much more than £200,000 gold a year, and the customs revenue at the other Hejaz ports is relatively unimportant. I am trying to obtain another independent estimate of the customs revenue, to check these figures. It is to be expected that Muhammad AH Riza would be tempted to exaggerate the revenue of the Hejaz in order to support his grievance against the Government for what he considers the selfish exploitation of his country. 3. Muhammad Ali Riza has recently spoken to me about this alleged exploitation of the Hejaz. On this occasion his views, like himself, were sober— at least more sober than in the interview reported in my above-mentioned despatch No. 78 of the 25th April. According to him the Hejazis believe that they are deliberately kept on the subsistence line so that they may be too busy getting a bare living to think about politics. Even the Hejaz tribes, he said, get nothing from Ibn Saud : it is only to the Nejd tribes that subsidies are paid. The picture of a future in which the revenue from Hasa oil would be so great that the C entrai Government could dispense with the revenue from the pilgrimage did not appeal to him. He said that if the Hejaz was left to itself it could live on its own resources, but how it would be governed, and how it would defend itself, he did not say, and the discretion with which the conversation had to be conducted on my side prevented my asking direct questions. He made great play witn the extravagance of the Saudi court—a matter on which the whole country has a real grievance. I have no doubt that he is telling the truth when he says that he has seen valuable lorries, which are worn out after a few journeys, carrying stic 's of native furniture from Riyadh for use in Mecca, where similar articles could have been bought for a few riyals. , ^ 4 According to their own statement, the Netherlands t rading Compa y now do most of the business for the Saudi Government «dio have emancipated themselves first from the local merchants.

I HAVh the honour to inform you that Ibn Saud summoned me to a final audience to-day before his departure for Mecca and thence to Nejd for his annual holiday. I was thus able to convey in person to the King, as well as by letter to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the congratulations on the discovery of oil in Hasa which you sent in your telegram No. 37 dated the 9th March. The King was much pleased at this mark of sympathy and expressed his appreciation and thanks. I have since received a letter in the same sense, written on the King’s behalf, from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. What with the visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and Lord Athlone, every detail of whose journey he follows personally with the greatest interest, and the discovery of oil, the King was in an excellent 'humour. He talked a good deal about European politics, going to pieces over names like Czecho slovakia, but showing a shrewd knowledge of the situation, but he did not refer to the projected negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Govern ment of Italy, as I had thought he might do. 3. Much of the talk was about the Yemen. The Imam, said the King, was always worrying about something. He made a lot out of Philby’s journey, and the other day he said that the British were working up to Nejran and asked what the King was going to do about it. This seemed to amuse the King, who always seems to find the Imam slightly ridiculous. He proceeded to criticise the Yemenis as thoroughly factious and savage and untrustworthy, and related various incidents in support of this thesis. He then talked about the Hadhramaut in the sense of the communication from Fuad Bey which I have reported in my despatch No. 39 dated the 8th March. I hope to have time before the bag closes to give the gist of the King’s remarks as a postscript to that despatch: 4. The King repeated the kind invitation which he gave me on the occasion of Lord Belhaven’s visit (my despatch No. 9 dated the 19th January) to spend some time with him in the desert next spring, if the rains should be good. As he pressed for a reply, I could only say that, if His Majesty did not mind my being no great sportsman, I should be very glad to come. It seemed to me that I might do more good in camp with the King for a week or so, than sitting at a desk in Jedda. and I trust that you will approve my general acceptance of the invitation.

Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 4.) remarkable even for Saudi laws, is probably the compiler’s own. To mention only one instance : An employee who was paid 39£ Saudi riyals a month would escape the dehnitions in sections 4 and 5, and thus his employer would not be liable in respect of any accident that happened to him in the course of his work. Some of the other points where the drafting is defective are indicated in square brackets. 3. Judged by the standards of this country, the rates of compensation are extraordinarily high, e.g., £450 gold for permanent total disablement of a skilled workman. It is quite right that wealthy foreign companies should pay adequate compensation in such cases, and I am far from suggesting that the rates, regarded absolutely, are too high; but they are enormously greater than anything the Saudi Government would pay. Moreover, it is not certain that the victim or his next-of-kin would receive the full amount paid by the company. This doubt is founded upon the knowledge that the companies to whom this regulation applies are required by the terms of concessions to pay in gold for certain personnel who do not, in fact, receive salary at those rates. For instance, the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) have to pay to the Saudi Government £500 gold per annum in respect of the supervision of their concession by Najib Salha, and £20 gold per mensem for an “ inspector ” of very low status who is supposed to watch the drilling on the Farsan Islands. It is to be hoped that the analogy I have drawn is not sound and that the full compensation will go to the victim or his next-of-kin. but a little scepticism is permissible. 4. The provision most open to objection is contained in article 20, which makes the regulation retrospective. It was partly on this account, though also on account of the high rates of compensation, that the Jedda manager of the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) proposed to his principals that the regulation should be resisted; they, however, instructed him to take no action. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company, it is believed, have asked their principals for instructions. It is inevitable that in the end all companies concerned will accept the regulation without protest. It is inevitable that this poverty-stricken country should try to make money out of the few foreign concessions in various ways, and it will not pay any of the companies to enter into controversy unless larger sums are at stake than are invoked in the application of this regulation. . . . ^ T am spnrhncr a coov of this despatch and enclosuie to the Piincipal [230 d—2]-\ x 'U S f ^ In any further communication on this subject, please quote ? and address —not to any perkon oyAam*, but to— . . , “Tj&gt;® Under-Secretary of State,” Boreign Office, London, S.W;. 1. f ^ o THE Under-Secretary of State for “Foreign^ Affairs presents his compliments to ^ ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop/ of the under-mentioned papeix Ml y* % Foreign Office, , 193 /.

H- ^ CONFIDENTIAL. o n c; I 1938 January 11 , 1938. Section 1. [E 196/196/25] Copy No. Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received January 11 . 1938.) (No. 181.) ^ Jedda, December 18, 1937. I HAVE had the honour to report to you by telegram on various questions raised in an interview which I had with Ibn Saud on the 15th December, during a visit of forty-eight hours which he paid to Jedda. I now give a summary of the whole of the conversation. 2 . His Majesty began, quite unexpectedly, wit h Iraq. He was worried at the instability and what might be called lack of continuity there. The Cabinet was divided and resignations were threatened, and some of the tribes were still hostile. I talked of the difficulties which naturally beset a country in the first stages of self-government, and said that in any case I should be surprised to hear that Saudi Arabia had any ground of complaint against the Iraq Govern ment. Ibn Saud said that that was true. Even in the time of Hikmet Sulaiman (though he seemed relieved that that regime had come to an end) he could not say that the attitude of the Iraq Government had been anything but correct towards himself and Saudi Arabia, but he felt that he never knew what would happen there next. For instance, there were people there who were bringing forward schemes for Palestine, not from love of Palestine or of the Arabs, nor from friendship towards His Majesty’s Government, but from personal ambition. I concluded that he was referring to the project of Nuri Pasha’s, which is mentioned in Bagdad telegram No. 261 of the 13th December, and which formed the subject of Mr. Kelly’s despatch, of which a copy was sent to me under cover of your despatch No. 369, dated the 30th September, 1937, and this impression was confirmed when the King mentioned a scheme which Nuri Pasha had explained to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in Egypt some time ago; but, as will be seen later, Ibn Saud had also heard of another Palestine scheme affecting Iraq. I sent a telegram to the Foreign Office on this point, No. 97, dated the 16th December. 3. The King then spoke of t he Italian s, of whom he seemed to be no less suspicious than he was when he talked to Mr? Rendel and myself in March. They were always interfering, now in one country, now in another. Look at the Yemen ! After the publication of the Italo-Yemeni Treaty not long ago, he wrote to the Imam and asked whether there was anything behind what was published. The Imam assured him that there was nothing, and he believed the Imam, who was a clever, wide-awake man; but he would not answer for the Imam’s sons, nor for the Yemeni officials. 4. The next subject was arms. Ibn Saud said that, as His Majesty s Government knew, he had tried to treat the Italian offer of arms in such a way as not to place himself under an obligation bv acceptance and yet not to offend the Italians. The offer of Italian rifles he had eventually refused, on the ground that his forces were equipped with Mausers, and that to introduce some weapons of a new type would complicate the rearmament question. The Italians th en said that they would get him any kind of rifles he liked, e.g., Mauseis nom Austria or Germany. The King then pleaded poverty, but the Italians said tna that need not worry him, they would arrange easy terms. Keeping to his delay mg tactics, the King said that* if they would provide samples he would study the matter; and there the matter rested for the moment. Had he done right ? What would His Majesty’s Government say? I repeated more or less what Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had already heard at the Foreign Office. His Majestv s Govern ment had provided all the arms which their own urgent needs enabled then, to spare If it had been within their power they would gladly ha\e supplied moie but ft was not Ibn Saud was the sole judge of his own requirements m the matter of arms' It would evidently be better if he could have recourse to neutral [205 1—1]2 supplies rather than to a Government like the Italian, whuh piesumably, as His Maiesty had himself said, was not oftering cheap arms out of pure lo\e for Saudi Arabia, but if in the end he could not escape the Italian oner, he would at least be acting with his eyes open. Ibn Saud said that he would continue f° delay as, far as he could, but there usually came a time in such cases where a decision could no longer be postponed. However, he would see what he could do. 5 . I mention here that, according to a statement which huad Hamza had made to me the day before, the Italians wanted to sell Italian guns and anti aircraft guns, in fact, any war material Ibn Saud might want as well as Mauser 6 . Passing then to aviation, Ibn Saud said that he^much wanted to get rid of the Italians 0 He reaTTseTTTFTat to replace them by British or French might create an awkward situation, but replacement by Moslems would not be open to the same objection. Could His Majesty’s Government suggest some suitable mao from Egypt or Iraq for this purpose ? I asked whether what His Majesty wanted was a trained air-force man to take charge of Saudi aviation, and after some talk His Majesty explained that he would like a sort of chief of staff to advise on all arms, and that, failing that, he would be glad to have an expert to take charge of aviation. I promised to report this desire to His Majesty’s Govern ment at once, and I have done so in my telegram No. 99, dated the 16th December. From the tenor of the conversation, I assume that Ibn Saud would apply to the Government concerned for the loan of a suitable expert if he could first have the advice of His Majesty’s Government as to the character and capacity of some possible candidates. I could see objections to the proposal, and felt sceptical as to the advantage, other than the elimination of the Italians, which Ibn Saud might expect to obtain if it were carried out; but we have had to blow cold upon so many Saudi aviation schemes that I did not want to be discouraging about this one at the outset, the more so as there is nothing to prevent the King’s applying to Egypt or Iraq without consulting us, in which case some quite unsuitable person might be sent here. 7. No reference was made by Ibn Saud to the alleged offer of a Soviet air mission (your despatch No. 413, dated the 1st November). This did not surprise me, for when I had mentioned the subject to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin the day before, he had expressed ignorance and surprise, and after making enquiry had told me that no such offer had been made and that Sheikh Hafiz must have misunderstood something much vaguer as to which he would get the papers from Mecca. I have no more information on this point at present, but it seems clear that there is no question of the acceptance of a Soviet air mission by Ibn Saud. 8 . The King then talked at length about Palestine. The views he expressed were summarised in my telegram NqJ^jdated the iSTFi December. He was not violent, or even reproachful, but very anxious about his own position as being dependent on that of His Majesty’s Government. He said more than once, as he has said before, that while he objected to the partition scheme as an Arab and a Moslem, he objected to it also because he felt it would be ruinous to His Majesty’s Government and therefore dangerous to himself. At one point he said he would rather that the British mandate should last for another century. I employed the familiar arguments in favour of partition, especially the one which has always appealed to me personally (provided that frontiers less unfavourable to the Arabs than those suggested in the report of the Royal Commission could be found), that a limitation by territory would be more stable and more likely to be final than a limitation by population, but the King said that, on the contrary, he believed that 1 e cJS^Hon of a separate Jewish State would be a perpetual irritant and source effecteF^ - he seemed unable to believe that partition would ever be Kiug asked whether I had seen the reply which he had caused to be ^iven to the accusation that out of deference to the feelings of His Majesty’s Government he had refused to allow an Arab conference to be held in Mecca. I hard that I had seen it m the Umm-al-Qura (see my despatch No. 177. dated the mAS.T’ “YTA if I might say so, to have beST^Fafted SmetnitTn tv. wls . dom T , Ib ' said that in spite of the denial therein ( onWnee IhnlftVTT U n . h / d h ®? 11 su ggested that there should be a se« VreN w^f nlr,,, ,eSt '? e m Mecca '. but he had refused to allow it, alleging*' Mecca was a place for religious worship, not for political conferences ThaiI as His ' Saudi L t least e lay as , i could ^ za had i anti- Hauser get rid might &gt;pen to le man wanted v some advise take lovern- ■ember. to the ive the f some ical as i Saud :1 upon about King’s quite iet air irprise before, old me 1 r stood I have 3 is no iressed r as not being , as he and a jestv’s would ed the ilways Arabs ), that ;hana d that source ver be to be jesty’s decca. . ed the [ with ■e was secret 7 that t was m fact one of his reasons, but, of course, he had others; he never embarked upon Pt 1 - C,y f U ? t p he Was Sure 1 A t reasonable, and he did not wish to embarrass s Majesty s Government. And besides, if the holding of a conference had been the course to pursue, he would have proposed it himself and not followed the &lt; ^ suggestions of others. at • &gt; ^n Te the King r 1 e 1 vealed a gain a secondary anxietv, viz., that His Majesty s Government would come to some arrangement about Palestine with someone else in the Arab world, or come to some fresh decision without his knowledge, and thus damage his prestige irretrievably. There was. he said, a story going about to which many were giving credence, that His Majesty’s Government pioposed to declare a cessation of Jewish immigration into Palestine and to hand the country over to the Iraq Government, who would then, as part of the bargain, open Palestine to unrestricted immigration by Jews. He said that he had always been frank with His Majesty’s Government, and he hoped they would always be frank with him. I described the scheme he had mentioned as fantastic in itself and incredible for two other reasons. In the first place partition was still the declared policy of His Majesty’s Government, though, of course, no one could foresee what the recommendations of the forthcoming commission would be, and in the second, His Majesty’s Government appreciated the complete frankness and sincerity with which His Majesty had always acted in the matter of Palestine, and I was sure they would never take any serious decision on the subject without giving him the earliest possible notice. 11. I bn Sand said he wished that some policy could be found which would not place His Majesty's Government in opposition to the Arabs. The one question of Palestine apart, the interests of His Majesty’s Government and the Arabs were identical, but the Arabs found themselves facing the Jews, whom they could easily deal with as Jews alone, and behind the Jews they found the British, and conflict was inevitable. The Arabs knew well and execrated the treatment of the Arabs in Libya by the Italians both before and after the war, and no one could have believed a year ago to what extent Mussolini would induce the Arabs to look upon him as their champion. His success was entirely due to the British policy in Palestine 12. At the time of the interview I had not received the instructions conveyed in your telegram No. 110 , dated the 15th December, which arrived after Ibn Sand had left Jedda, but, as will be seen from what I have said. I anticipated your assurance that there was nothing fresh to say, and that, if there was. he would he told as soon as possible. I also anticipated your message about the necessity for mutual comprehension of each other’s difficulties by the two Governments. I asked His Majesty whether he had not found, as he rose from being ruler of Riyadh to his present high position, that at every stage the points of contact with the world increased and political questions became more complicated, and when the King said that this was so, I asked whether he could not believe that the affairs of Great Britain, coming as she did into touch with many countries which did not concern Saudi Arabia seriously and having possessions all over the world, were even more complicated than His Majesty’s. Ibn Saud pondered a moment as though the matter had not struck him in that light before and said that he agreed, and I hope that the argument helped to convince him of the truth of my assurance, that it was not from failure to give careful attention to his proposals that His Majesty's Government had not been able to decide upon a policy more satisfactory from his point of view. 13. The matters other than politics which were touched upon at the interview are dealt with in my despatch No. 182, dated the 18th December. Throughout the interview Ibn Saud showed the friendliness and desire to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government wdiich were shown during the talks in March last when Mr. Rendel was here. 14. I am sending copies of this despatch to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, his Excellency the Governor of Aden and the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

I HAVE the honour to report the promulgation by the authorities of two measures which appear to be part of the ‘ ‘ Back to Religion campaign about which I reported in my despatch No. 91 dated the 8 th May. 2. The first is an order which was issued by town crier, forbidding all Moslems to shave their beards. The penalty for infringement of this regulation is a fine of 7 riyals. Any barber who shaves the beard of a Moslem is also liable to a fine. It was understood from the beginning that the employees of foreign missions in Jedda would not be interfered with in this respect, but a messengei attached to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company has been fined for a breach of the regulation. It is understood that a considerable sum m fines has been collected in Mecca, but that on at least one occasion the authorities were disappointed by a Javanese who, after being kept in prison and under obseivation for several days, was still without the rudiments of a beard and had to be discharged unpunished. . . , ^ ^ 3 . Most Javanese, in fact, sometimes through natural inability, but otten from choice, do not wear beards, and the Netherlands Charge d Affaires, who is himself a Javanese, recently visited Mecca to investigate this question. He was assured by the authorities that if any foreigners had been punished under the beards regulation it was through a misunderstanding, and that if M. W idjo- ioatmoio heard of the application of the regulation to a Netherlands subject he had only to inform the authorities to have the mistake rectified. This decision is more generous than the regulation itself, which certainly applied to all Moslems, though as it has never been put in writing that cannot be proved. I may say that no case has been heard of where any British subject has been called upon to comply with the regulation. A . 4. The regulation on beards is not new, but is merely the re-enactment ot a measure which has been allowed to fall into disuse. The renewal of official hostility to shaving is said to be due to Ibn Baud’s annoyance at the discovery of a Saudi youth movement and to his determination to teach its adherents not to be modernising toads. I learn from a good source that there is at least one tact behind the story of the youth movement, viz., the discovery by the Saudi Govern ment that one of the Hejazi students in Egypt was in touch with Salama Musa with a view to the ventilation of Hejazi grievances. It is said that the young man was recalled to Mecca, discovered most conveniently writing an incriminating letter, measure i s a prohibition published by the Ministry of Finance forbidding the importation and sale of what were assumed at first to be statuettes, but turn out to be all representations in three dimensions of any living creatuie. from a bust of Mustafa Kemal to a Teddy bear. It appears that the measure was prompted by the discovery that some of the children in Mecca had dolls to play photographed, an£thisyear a ^ the consent! '’But'perhaps there is some “ Ct ’^ b i' s ES^peXpVp^ - a ' d t0 Allah. [55 f—3]6 . There is yet another measure which I hear is to be applied during the forthcoming pilgrim season, though it has not been announced in public. women pilgrims are to wear complete wrappings such as the Hejaz women wear Of late years some women pilgrims have been wearing the pre-war Turkish dress (black) of cape, close-fitting hood, and thinnish veil, but this is no longer to be considered adequate. It is not known what action will be taken against recalcit-* rants, still more against any women who are rash enough to follow the example of those Egyptian ladies who, I am assured, sometimes appeared unveiled even in the courtyard of the Mecca mosque this last season. 7.

ON the eve of his departure from the Hejaz after the pilgrim season Ibn Saud published a “ Back to Religion ” proclamation of which I have the honour to transmit a summary herewith. It first strikes the attention because it is addressed to “ Yemenis ” as well as Nejdis and Hejazis. I am assured that it is legitimate to describe the inhabitants of Asir and Najran as Yemenis, but whether it is politic of Ibn Saud to use a term which might offend the Imam and which he could have avoided is another matter. 2. An even greater cause of surprise is the fact that the proclamation has appeared at all in this form, since nothing has been heard of a movement of Saudi young men in favour of modernisation, freedom, and so on. It might fairly be said that Ibn Saud has himself been the great moderniser, since it is under his aegis that the gramophone (nominally forbidden but in practice much in evidence; and the wireless have been introduced even into the holy cities, that non-Moslem engineers have wandered all over the Hejaz except for two not very large circles with Mecca and Medina as their centres, and that the crossing of Arabia by Europeans has become a common occurrence. It is perhaps partly for this reason that the proclamation has been issued. It may be that although the more fanatical Wahabis have lost much ground there is still enough of their spirit left in Nejd for Ibn Saud to wish to stand well wdth them and for that reason to call for a return to the Koran and the religion of the Prophet. 3. Another of the motives which prompted the issue of the proclamation was probably the desire of Ibn Saud to establish his position in the Moslem world as a pillar of orthodoxy. I have already referred, in my despatch No. 33 dated the 4th March, to his public claim to be a good Hanbali with a profound respect for the other three Sunni sects. Whether there is anything in the belief held by some people that he secretly cherishes the hope of becoming Caliph one day is difficult to decide, but it is certain that he would like to conciliate the Moslem world on religious grounds and that for financial reasons he must do anything within the limits of religion to attract as many pilgrims as possible to the Hejaz. It is to be expected that the Saudi propagandists in India and elsewhere will make the most of the proclamation, and will point to the contrast between countries like Turkey, where the true faith has been abandoned, and Saudi Arabia, where the political head of the State proclaims himself the humble servant of Allah and calls on his people to live their lives in accordance with the precepts of the Koran and of the Prophet. . 4 . The advice to Saudi women to stay at home and confine their attention to domestic duties seems superfluous, since there is no sign that they ever do an y _ thing else in this country, unless the King has in mind the fact that a few of the Moslem ladies of Jedda, probably of Syrian or other foreign origin, go out in parties in the evening and walk by the sea, and that some of them no ffi n g er w ear the shapeless clothing of the ordinary Hejaz woman but have adopted the dress which was worn by Turkish women before the Great War. The King may be particularly sensitive on the question of women, since it is clear that if women in this country acquired even as high a position as they had in Turkey before the Kemalist social revolution, the domestic policy of a ruler who has perhaps a hundred and sixty marriages to his credit might be restnc e . 5. It is inevitable that the reader should see some connexion between the proclamation and the alleged formation of a some y ca e , _ , . ^ Hejaz ” about which I reported in my two despatches No 66 ‘helTthAprU 'vTrti 7 n nf thp iQtV» Anril It is known that the k?auai brovernment were “.tai’by the ~i.tr. » .p.« &lt;•&lt; ^ »'«»P* »'«■ [6 bb— 1 ], Tn „ «, con d article, which is signed by a Hejazi, the they affected to regard it tn a se c t ejected by his church and its writer describes Salama Musa . jj e j az j belongs to the alleged society- monks, and maintains that not a g , J at WOI . k f or SO me three years.

The warning is believed to have been to this effect . T . „ “0 people of Mecca! I am very angry with you. In spite of all the favours I have shown you, you ungrateful creatures are still engaged in mischievous propaganda against me. This Musa Salama is merely an instrument in your hands. I know everything that happens; I have spies even over your wives. The only real Hejazis are the Quraish (the Prophet s tribe) and the Sharifs. The Quraish are camel-drivers the Ashraf (i.e Sharif s') ou-ht rather to be called Ashrar (i.e., the wicked), while the rest of you are outliders-Indians, Egyptians, and what not. Once again I warn you to abandon vour evil machinations, or by Allah I \\ ill bring down on yon; the might of the merciless Nejdis and there will be nothing left m Mecca but vour decapitated heads. This is my last warning.’' 7 . It is reported that at another gathering in Mecca Ibn Baud declared that he never touched any money from the Hejaz and that he was living as he had always lived, on the milk of his camels and the dates of Aejd. It is true that Ibn Baud lives simply, but it is equally true that the greater part of the income of the Saudi State is drawn from the Hejaz. In my despatch No. 38 E. dated the 11 th March I pointed out the difficulty of Ibn Saud’s situation, in that he is still almost entirely dependent on the pilgrimage revenue, which the Hejazis regard as theirs by* immemorial right. No ruler who cannot afford to leave most of the pilgrimage revenue to the Hejaz can expect to be popular with the Hejazis. Politics has little to do with the attitude of the Hejaz towards its present ruler, but the malcontents might use politics as a weapon, and it is possible that the “Friends of the Hejaz Society’’ has some Hejazi support behind it; but I cannot think that such support is important or that it has a positive policy. 8 .

Summary of a Proclamation by Ibn Saud in the Umm-al-Qura of April 30, 1937. THE proclamation, which occupies the two first pages and has a large head line, begins, after the proper religious exclamations: “From Abdul Aziz-bin- Abdul Rahman-bin-Feisal-al-Saud to whom it may concern of our brothers th 6 Hejazis, the Nejdis and the Yemenis.’ The proclamation, says Ibn Saud, has been prompted by what he has seen of wrong in the world of to-dav. There are people who call themselves Moslems but have followed imaginings and vices created by the devil—“ modernisation,” “ freedom,” “ civilisation ” and so on. Ihey demand progress. To them progress is civilisation and freedom, and obedience to the Koran and the commands of the Prophet is reaction Hence the present appeal, lest the devil lead the people astray. Those who are demandingmodernisation and claiming that it is the duty which they as young men owe to their country and their people have misunderstood the words they are using. They have been misled by the devil; they are acting against their religion and against the interests of the Arabs. There has recently been propaganda about civilisation which has induced some to follow atheistical and immoral opinions in the belief that they are following in the path of civilised countries. But the most disgraceful thing is that any man should worship or fear any other than Allah. Still more [sic'] disgraceful is it that women should associate with men on the pretext of “ progress ” and do other things for which they were not created, abandoning their chief duty of housekeeping and the bringing-up of children, upon which the strength of a nation depends, for self-adornment and the frequentation of immoral places. Progress and civilisation forsooth! Such theories lead to destruction, and are inacceptable except to men who abandon their religion and their Arab nationality. It is not the intention to be oppressive to women. Islam allows them rights such as they do not enjoy in many civilised lands, and if rightly followed it does not hinder progress in life. This is admitted by right-thinking Europeans. Many such foreigners have complained to the King of the growth of immorality in their countries and have expressed their admiration at the adherence of the Moslems to their religion and their traditions. They wish that they could remedy that dreadful condition of affairs, which threatens to destroy their countries and to lead to terrible wars. Ibn Baud is consequently astonished that those of the young men who claim to be educated should not take a warning from the immoralities of other countries but should persist in their wrongful acts and refuse to return to religion. The King feels it his duty as a Moslem and an Arab to give this advice to those over whom Allah has made him a ruler, and to be patient under any criticism that may be directed against him. Anything right he has said is from Allah, and anything wrong (for which may Allah forgive him!) is from himself and the devil.Notes. Minute Paper, Register No. P. Z. 2817/57. SECRET.

I HAVE the honour to submit a few remarks on the financial situation of Ibn Sand and its effect upon policy. '2. In the recent monthly reports sent in from this post reference has been made to the determined efforts displayed by the Saudi authorities to collect money otherwise than by taxation, not only from their own subjects, but also from pilgrims. The Aviation Society has published regularly in the press during the last few weeks an appeal to pilgrims urging them to subscribe for the defence of their fatherland, the Holy Land of the Hejaz. Then there is the Piastre Scheme, whose main object seems to be the encouragement of local industries. The committee in charge of this project have gone so far as to publish in the Saut-al- Hejaz newspaper an appeal to Moslems written in ill-spelt English, and to advertise small boxes of dates for pilgrims to take home as “A Present from Medina.” Other objects for which subscriptions are invited are the sacred well of Zamzam, the Waziriya water scheme for Jedda, the First Aid Society, the Charitable Society, the Asylum for Orphans and the Aged, and so on. The pilgrim guides are required to press these schemes upon the attention of their pilgrims, and for the Aviation Society the guides are under moral compulsion to bin books of 1 riyal tickets proportioned to the number and supposed wealth ol their pilgrims, and are left to pass them on to the pilgrims if they can, or to beai the loss themselves. Pilgrims have been subjected to pressure on behalf of these various schemes, but no complaints have been received from British pilgrims, t is accepted that a pilgrim should distribute what he can in charity while he is in the Hejaz. and if there were no societies appealing for his money, it might go to individual beneficiaries or be extorted under various pretexts by the guic es. 3 It is easy to deride the thirst for money which underlies these appeals, and the latest Jedda report contrasts the requests for charity with Ibn baud s alleged expenditure of over £600 for walnuts and pistachio nuts for his last hunting trip. But it is impossible not to feel some sympathy for him. His personal expenditure is doubtless wasteful in some ^ ^ nrirJces poor country to have to support a royal family, which includes twenty-fhe P™ces and a corresponding number of princesses and queens, but there is no reason think that any economy that would he compatible with the King s poswon ani oriental methods of accountancy would make a great difterence to the b g | 4 The word “ budget ” is only used by convention, for it is probable tna the Saudi budget exists largely in the head of the who is Ibn Saud s Minister of Finance.

The d „ t 0 f j n( ji a a t the tune of the recover the cost of arms supplied by the Government 1981 e—11Neid rebellion in 1929, are only too well known to His Majesty s Government. \lthough considerable sums have been collected from pilgrims &lt; ui mg the last two months there are the usual signs of financial stringency. The Legation even had to appeal to the good offices of the Deputy Minister for horeign Afiairs tor pay ment of the balance due to the Eastern Telegraph Company (Limited) for the &gt; period ending the 31st January; the Saudi Government paid €1,000 and left 0 over £ 2,000 outstanding. . ... ,. „ . , . 5 The main difficulty is that in spite of his policy ot economic development Ibn Sand is still dependent almost entirely, either directly or indirectly, on the pilgrimage as a source of revenue. It is nearly a year now since theie seemed to be Ground for hope that oil would shortly be discovered in Hasa in commercial quantities, but this hope has not been fulfilled, though it is true that it has not been abandoned. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate ha\e discovered a gold mine, or rediscovered an old one, with gold m what would oidmanlv be paying quantities but the water which would make it possible to work the mine on an economic basis has not yet been found. The Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited), which has begun to prospect for oil along the coastal belt of the Reel Sea has no good news to report. It is true that the prospectors have not been at work long, and it must also be remembered that an American company found oil at Bahrein where the Shell Company had given up the search, but the reports from the company’s experienced geologists, who seem to have covered most of the ground, have left the Jedda manager very gloomy. Two other possible sources of wealth can be foreseen at present: that oil will be found in the Rub’-al-Khali, and that somewhere in such parts of Arabia as are not included in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s concession gold or some other valuable mineral will be found in quantities and in conditions that will repay the working. There can be little in the commercial schemes which are discussed in the Mecca press from time to time. It is not by selling to pilgrims small boxes of Medina dates that the Saudi budget will be made to meet at the back, nor by curing rather less badly the few skins the country has to export. Several grandiose schemes, which in succession raised Saudi hopes, have come to nothing. The chief of these were the Jedda-Mecca Railway, the Saudi State Bank, which the ex-Khedive was supposed to be prepared to establish, and the loan of half a million or so which the Saudi Government hoped they could raise in England on rather vague security. 6 . For the present, then, the Saudi Government are living on the pilgrimage revenues supplemented by windfalls, such as advances in respect of the various concessions, the purchase by the Italian Government of an unknown number of camels at absurdly high prices, and consignments of arms, petrol, &amp;c., for which they have never paid. Thus, windfalls apart, Saudi Arabia is dependent upon a source of revenue on which not even the Hejaz alone had to live before the war, for there seems to be no doubt that the Ottoman Government put into the Hejaz, in the way of subsidies and in overhead expenses, more than they ever got out of it. The country being dependent upon the pilgrimage, the size of the pilgrimage is of the first importance. The fluctuations of this manifestation of religious enthusiasm are well known to vou. 1 he total of overseas pilgrims this vear was about 50,000. In 1927 it rose to 132,000, and in 1933 it fell to 21,000. The number of pilgrims falls in times of economic stress, but it is also affected by national policy and social changes, as in Soviet Russia, Turkey and Persia. No &gt;o\iet citizens, and very few Turkish, now come on the pilgrimage, and the number of Persians is diminishing. Statements made recently in the course of conversation by members of the Persian and Afghan Legations in Jedda suggest that their Governments regard the pilgrimage as a useless drain upon the national resources. On the other hand, it seems likely that the increasing feeling of Arab so idarity will help to maintain, if not to increase, the number of pilgrims from BYTE oyna and I alestine and perhaps Iraq, while in Moslem countries under European rule not only will the authorities be careful not to take any action mi rtht )e interpreted as interference with the pilgrimage, but nationalist eelmg will probably tend to encourage the pilgrimage by using religious to supplement political feeling. But it seems unlikely that the average number of pilgrims will increase to such a point as to enable Ibn Saud to reduce the oppressive pilgrim dues which he would doubtless be glad to do not only because he would be exposed to less criticism, but for religious reasons too.I ‘ninient, Ifist two ven had tor pay. for the a md left lopment , on the &gt;ed to be imercial has not l a gold paying e on an vV estern belt of lave not ompany but the covered possible in the ncluded valuable working, i Mecca Medina l rather ch ernes, of these ive was o which * vague primage various nher of r which upon a he war, Hejaz, t: out of primage eligious car was .

I have redrawn above the familiar picture of Ibn Saud searching year after year for normal sources of revenue, and thrown back time after time on the most invidious, viz., levy of toll upon Moslems making the pilgrimage to the shrine of Allah. It would not be surprising if this disposed him to class his ^country with the “ have-nots.” And it happens that with the exception of the Yemen, which he refrained from annexing in 1935, partly out of consideration for pan-Arab feeling, but partly no doubt for fear of Italy, he sees around him on the Arabian Peninsula more than one territory which he could absorb but for His Majesty's Government, and whose absorption would be to his economic advantage. This does not apply to the south, for whatever political attraction the Hadhramaut may have for him, it contains no obvious form of material wealth. But on the Persian Gulf the situation is different. There is one small sheikh in possession of the fine natural harbour of Koweit and a pearl fishery, and in far too favourable a position for smuggling into Saudi territory. Another sheikh so small that Ibn Saud always refers to him by a familiar nickname, not only claims the whole of the Qatar Peninsula, including a hill that Ibn Saud particularly wants for himself, but has granted an oil concession like an independent sovereign. Running down the coast are various insignificant people whose only purpose in life seems to be to bar Ibn Saud from the sea, from any oil that may be discovered there, and from any pickings that might be got out of Imperial Airways. Finally, there is Bahrein, which used to belong to Ibn Saud’s ancestors but now stands more or less on its own feet, and which, moreover, has an oil well gushing away as if in mockery of the miserable seepings in the wells which have been bored 'in Hasa. And in all these territories His Majesty’s Government have “ interests” which prevent their being absorbed, as much to their own as to the general advantage, in Saudi Arabia. Such is the picture which Ibn Saud may be expected to paint to himself. 8 . In these circumstances it is reasonable to suppose that although Ibn Saud seems to have decided that on the whole His Majesty’s Government are to be preferred to the Italians as friends, the recognition of our interests in Arabia puts a great strain upon a monarch who is not only ambitious but probably insolvent too. It might be argued that the poorer Ibn Saud is the less likely he is to engage in a policy of adventure, but my own opinion is that on the whole a more generous view is ]ustified, viz., that anything that increases his legitimate revenue is to be welcomed by His Majesty’s Government, and any expenditure that might embarrass his finances is to he deprecated. To increase his re\enue is not in our power, for without giving pilgrims money, as the Italians have done this year for propaganda purposes, we can hardly do more to facilitate the accomplishment of the pilgrimage by British pilgrims than is done already. Me can however, apply the second principle to any scheme which comes up tor consideration In my despatch No. 20, dated the 10 th February, I a PP t ns principle to the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps help in the reconstruction of the Saudi portion of the Hejaz Railway and opposed it chiefly on the ground that the railway would be a financial liability to ibn baud and not an asset. If it could be shown that the railway would not be a burden on Saudi finances, the proposal would, I think, deserve reconsideration. The principle enters into the consideration of other questions affecting the relations of His Majesty’s Government with Saudi Arabia, but it is unnecessary to go into details here. T i p I have, Ac.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith the general survey of economic, commercial and financial conditions in Saudi Arabia, to which Sir Andrew Ryan has from time to time referred in correspondence with your Department, and to which a reference is made in Sir John Simon’s despatch No. 294 of the 30th July, 1934, paragraph 3. 2. This general survey has been prepared by Mr. Vice-Consul Oppenheim, and is the first report of its kind made by this Legation in respect of the political entity now known as Saudi Arabia. It is, indeed, only the second comprehensive economic survey attempted in this post over a period of many years, the previous instance being the report, on economic conditions in the Hejaz, drawn up by Mr. Grafftey-Smith in 1923, forwarded to the Foreign Office under Mr. Bullard’s despatch No. 12 O.T. of the 31st October of that year. 3 . The compilation of this survey has been in contemplation, as you are aware, for a number of years, but its‘magnitude, if it were to receive careful treatment, and the pressure of more urgent affairs have led to postponement of the undertaking. It will be readily understood that to assemble the material for the report from information gleaned with difficulty and in meagre quantities over a long period of time, especially from local sources often reluctant and generally unable to impart particulars 'in an exact and scientific form, has proved a laborious task. To that task, Mr. Oppenheim has devoted himself with industry and enthusiasm, and I venture to commend both the zeal and the ability displayed by him in compiling what I believe is a valuable record of the general economic and commercial life of Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia is a poor country. Its trade is almost negligible, depend: for the great part on the attraction of a religious pilgrimage. It is, however country from whose sands the last two years have revealed oil and gold, eiti of which may lead it to a more important place in the economic world. Moreovt Saudi Arabia is a country, immense in size, of which large areas are ot superficially known, and who can to-day say whether the apparent barrenne* the land is a true or false gauge of its poverty! * i I Having these extraordinary conditions in mind, this report has hadtoa more at a general survey of the'economic life and progress of the country and the nature of its administration and people than at an attempt to set for mathematical information concerning national resources or statistics of impc and exports, little of which could be more than guess work.

Even when this truth had “ Western ” in outlook. Now, it found itself no longer a mere country of passage, but the spiritual centre of a new and separate civilisation; it became ‘ ‘ Eastern ’ ’; trade with Europe was cut and the commerce of the peninsula became, what it still largely is, the commerce of the pilgrimage. With the spread of Islam, a new transit trade sprang up in the Red Sea, which was to endure until the days of the steamer and the Suez Canal, for Jedda, the port of Mecca, became by virtue of its pilgrim trade an entrepot for the trade between Egypt and India and the East. In the middle of the 19th century as many as forty native Indian ships, under the British flag, were engaged in trading to Jedda with pilgrims and goods, the latter destined largely for transhipment by Arab dhows to Egypt. Direct trade with Europe was reopened with the discovery of the Cape route, but was long confined to the richer and less fanatical south-west and south-east of the peninsula, areas which to-day lie outside the frontiers of Saudi Arabia. It was the establishment of the ‘ ‘ Overland Service ’ ’ to India which first attracted the attention of modern Powers, especially France and Britain, to the Red Sea Coasts; Jedda was necessary in those early days to ships as a coaling and revictualling station, a fact which gave rise to agencies and a small European commercial community. This revival of direct contact with Europe and Europeans and the establishment of a through trade route to the East in the Red Sea ushered in a new era for the commerce of this part of Arabia, the Hejaz. The first economic effect was the destruction of the Jedda native entrepot trade, which, in parenthesis, doubtless contributed an economic factor to the ill-feeling that culminated in the massacre of Europeans in 1858. Native shipping was replaced entirely by European steamers; trade was increasingly concentrated in European hands; trade began once more to incline to the west, a tendency which is still far from complete and which Japan may successfully check. These later developments were less noticeable in the central and eastern portions of the peninsula. The centre, Nejd, even to-day carries on trade along her mediaeval caravan routes, and it is only in the latest years that she has come into touch with foreign trade through the political unification of the country and the contacts of her Government. The trade of the east, Hasa is still entirely m native hands and still oriented towards the east rather than the west.

XX.—The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. oth art country was known from 1926 to 1932.6 which all rights are shared equally by Saudi Arabia and Iraq in the one case, and Saudi Arabia and Koweit in the other. The latter, which is economically the more important area, forms an irregular quadrangle on the base of the Persian Gulf coast from Ras Mish’ab to Ras-al-Qalia. The south-eastern frontier is still unsettled, but the de facto line may be said to run south from the head of Dohat-as-Salwa out into the Great Desert, the Rub- ai-Khali. The southern frontier, now fixed by treaty with the Yemen, runs inland from a point north of Midi on the Red Sea coast. Excerpts from the relevant treaties giving exact definition of the frontiers will be found in an appendix to this report (b) Physical Features and Climate (see Map I(')). The country enclosed within these frontiers is divided into three geographical zones, each of which lends itself to generalisation. The most important characteristic of the peninsula is the range of mountains which runs the leno-th of the west coast, the Hejaz mountains, dividing, as its name signifies, the eastern plateau (Nejd) from the Red Sea. Coastward from the Hejaz range lie the foot hills and narrow coastal plain called Tihama. The climate of this zone is hot and near the sea extremely damp. The soil is sandy and unfertile, and the zone would be of little importance did not the foothills harbour the cities of Mecca and Medina, the holiness of which has transformed this naked waste into a centre of pilgrimage and brought trade and money to its ports. The Hejaz range itself, averaging v 5,000 feet, rises to a height of 8,000 feet in the Harrat areas (lava desert) on the north, and still higher to 10,000 and 12,000 feet in Asir. The climate of this mountain is less torrid. Rain is plentiful in the winter, especially in the south, and good vegetation is found in the larger oases of Taima, Khaibar, Taif, Turaba and Abha. Eastward from the Hejaz range the surface of the land slopes gradually down to the Persian Gulf, the central plateau having a mean elevation of somewhat oyer 2,000 feet. Here and there harder masses stand above the level of the plateau, as the Jebel Shammar, 5,000 feet, and the long low ridge of Jebel Tuwaiq 1 he whole of this third zone is divided into two parts by a ring of deserts which is almost continuous from the Great Nafud in the north, through the Dahana to the east of Jebel luwaiq, down to the Rub-al-Khali in the south. The area between the Hejaz range and the desert ring is Nejd (the plateau), and consists aigeh of gravel plains and steppe land, cut into by strips of Dahana (hard desert plain covered by sand belts), or Nafud (deep sand formed into dunes). Jebel bhammar and Jebel Tuwaiq form a bulwark against these deserts, and harbour whirh nnm 1 ! y fi SufflC ! ent su b-surface water to support a semi-circle of oases, vhich politically and geographically fall into three groups: Firstly Jebel bhammo^mfl } lt l S T hlef t0 T of l H , ail; secondly, the Qasim between Jebel including, notably 3 the'capital^Riy'adh^ aShm ’ ^ Wadl DaWaSlr diStnCtS ’ Wad?^rhnn th wdl i n L 0 f l de f rts iie ’ ^ north &gt; the fertile depression of the A1 Hasa mo’st.lv barren 'f oasls at Jauf and to the east the coastal plain of A1 Hasa 'oasis wdh the tr.

Fhe majoiity of the population is Arab, but slavery and the pilgrimage have mi j e T ^ es P e cially in the Hejaz, where Abyssinians, Negroes, Javanese and Indians h«i\e all left their mark. The immigration of African negroes has led to the foundation of black communities, notably the town of Khaibar In the Hejaz the Hadhramis form an important and useful element amono- s t the commercial community known for their industry as the Jews elsewhere. ° In Mecca, Medina and Jedda there is'an important Indian merchant community, of which the Patnis, inhabitants of the town of Pattan in Baroda, form a picturesque part. This small Indian town has maintained a secular connexion with Hejaz trade. Some firms have been established for several hundred years in Jedda, yet it is doubtful whether any member during that period has been born in the Hejaz, so assiduously is the link with India maintained. Jedda is the only town in which European commercial firms are established. HI. — Administration (see Map II( ! )). (a) Government. Saudi Arabia is since 1932 a united kingdom. It has, however, no systematised Government, and the theoretical constitutional differences between the Hejaz and Nejd are great. The King granted the Hejaz a Constitution in 1926, placing the administration under his second son Feisal, who holds the title of Viceroy. Nejd, on the other hand, remained under the traditional patriarchal system of Government, being governed as a congerie of sheikhdoms. In practice, however, constitutional differences have little effect. The Government of the country is throughout an autocracy, and the smallest questions are referred to the King’s decision which is unfettered save by the rulings of the Sharia or Khoranic Law. Since the unification of the kingdom in 1932, the tendency is to make certain administrative departments common to the whole country, notably that of finance, and with it of customs. The Constitution of the whole of Saudi Arabia,' promised in 1932, has not materialised. (b) Law. The law is the religious Sharia law, and no legislation may be decreed which is in contradiction to the fundamental teachings of Islam, the writings of the Koran and the works and sayings of the Prophet. In consequence judges are of necessity appointed from amongst the ulema, learned men in theology. In Jedda the Majlis-at-Tujjar, or Assembly of Merchants, composed of six merchants and a member of the Sharia Court, appointed for periods of two yeai s, has magisterial powers to deal in the first instance with certain commeicia disputes. Its functions are defined by the Saudi Commercial Code of 1931-3‘, and includes judgment of disputes between merchants; dhow owneis, ship owneis and merchants; banks and merchants; and so forth. Disputes with Government departments, e.g., disputes over assessment o duty, cannot be taken to the courts, but are referred m the first place to the loca Governor (in Jedda the kaimakam) and, through him, to the respective Ministries. (V) Not reproduced.(c) Public Security. Ibn Saud has ruled with a strong hand, and there is security of travel and peace between the tribes such as has not been known in Aiabia lor many centuries. Europeans, however, are not permitted to tia\el in the country without the consent and the protection of the Government, but such travel is now relatively common except in the south-west. Non-Moslems are not permitted to enter the holy territories that surround Mecca and Medina. ' Security of life is equalled by the security of property, the thief and robber being greatly discouraged by the rigour of the religious law. (d) Commercial Legislation. Commercial Code .—A Commercial Code based mainly on the old Ottoman codes was published in successive numbers of the official newspaper, the Umm-al-Q,ura, from the 7th August, 1931, to the 26th February, 1932, coming into force on the latter date. The code originally applied to the Hejaz only and, so far as it applies to the Majlis-at-Tujjar, still relates to the Hejaz only. Ownership of real property .—Regulations issued on the 26th October, 1934, reaffirmed the old principle that foreigners may not hold property in the Hejaz as distinct from the rest of Saudi Arabia. Company registration and licences to trade .—By regulation No. 144 of the 16th Muharram, 1347 (1928), commercial companies (“ association of more than one person for the purposes of trade ”), including agents, must register with the Government. By official communique No. 14 of the 1st Rabi-al-Thani, 1353 (the 13th July, 1934), all people practising trade in Saudi Arabia must obtain a licence from the finance department of the town in which they live. For this purpose, firms, shops and vendors booths are divided into four categories which pay for licences annually at the rates of £2 gold, £1 gold, gold and £J gold respectively. Doctors, dentists, chemists and chauffeurs are subject to special regulations. Patents and Irade-marks .—!No provision seems to be made either in the Sharia law or the Commercial Code mentioned above for the registration or protection of patents and trade-marks. Debtors. Commercial debts are heard according to the Commercial Code of 1931-32 before the Majlis-at-Tujjar in the first instance and, if complicated, before the religious Sharia court. By a decree of the 25th November, 1932. piovisipn was made for preventing defendants from leaving the jurisdiction of i oui ts m which they are sued for debt. There are no firms of lawvers in the country, and absent creditors must appoint local agents to plead their cases before the court. r ir • ct . cl . ls ^ oms t a . ri ff applicable to the whole of Saudi Arabia was ?oqqx A m 0fi ?

(4) According to the Sharia Law, and confirmed by Royal decree early in 1926, no interest may be charged on loans or bank deposits; it is legal, however, with the ^ former, to charge an agent’s commission. Legislative Restrictions on Trade. —(1) By regulations published on the 31st October, 1935. the import of all arms and ammunition, other than sporting guns and cartridges, was forbidden. These latter are covered by a decree of the 15th May, 1931, whereby their import and export is forbidden, except by Govern ment licence. (2) Import and export of narcotics is only permitted under Government control; regulations published on the 7th, 14th and 21st September, 1934. (3) Henbane, which is grown in parts of Saudi Arabia, is forbidden for export. (e) Commercial Treaty Relations with Neighhouring Arab States. Transjordan. —There is no commercial agreement with Transjordan. By article 9 of the Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage ” signed in 1933, the tribes of either State are free to move across the frontier for their own trading purposes. By an exchange of correspondence in October 1928 and August 1929, the two Governments notified each other that trade between their territories must pass through certain posts: on the Saudi side Qarryat, Jauf, Taima, Tabuk or Dhaba; on the Transjordan side, Aqaba or the routes Jauf-Mafr-Ma'an, Tabuk- Ma’an, Qarryat-al-Malh-Umari-al-Muwaqqar-Sahb-Amman. Syria. —Commercial relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria and the Lebanon are at present governed by Chapter III of the Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage ” signed between them on the 10th November, 1931. The treaty, pending the conclusion of a special commercial agreement, regulates the entry of merchant caravans of one State into either of the other two and abolishes all taxes levied by tribes on such caravans. By the Hadda Agreement of 1925 between Nejd and Great Britain, the latter guarantees freedom of transit to bona fide Nejdi merchants across mandated territory for the prosecution of their trade with Syria, and undertakes to exempt their goods from customs dues when their trade is not confined to camels and other animals. put Iraq. There is no special commercial agreement. Article 3 ot the treaty of Muhammara (1922) stipulates treatment of the goods of either country on an equal basis with those of other States. Article 6 of the Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage ” of the 7th April, 1931, allows for the movement of tribes across the frontiers in the prosecution of their own trading. In 193a a special agreemen concerning the opening up of the motor pilgrim route from Najaf to Hail and Medina was reached between the two countries. ^ . , o j; Koweit There is no commercial agreement between Koweit and feaudi Arabfa The Government of Nejd and later of Saudi Arabia have maintained for many years an embargo on all trade between the^two countries This embargo ha. long been the subject of negotiations between Hs a j _J , reac [j e( j ; n Saudi Arab Government and it is hoped that an arrangement wiU te ^hed *n the near future which will put an end to a state of affairs, deleterious interests of both countries. \r a ip S tv’s Government and the Saudi Bahrein.

(f) Commercial Treaty Relations with other States. Since the lifting of the ban on Soviet products early in 1933, equal treatment has been accorded to all States trading with Saudi Arabia. A commercial treaty has been signed with Italy (Jedda, the 10th Febuarv 1932) stipulating most-favoured-nation treatment for vessels, merchandise and fishing boats of either nation, the last with reference to Eritrea. A “Provisional Agreement,'* concerning reciprocal most-favoured-nation rights, was signed with the United States in London on the 7th November, 1933 Treaties of friendship, including most-favoured-nation clauses, have been concluded with Germany (Cairo, the 26th April, 1929) and France (Jedda. the 10th November, 1931, ratified the 24th June, 1932). Treaties embodying a clause signifying the desire of the contracting parties to conclude at some future date a commercial treaty have been signed with Turkey (Mecca, the 3rd August, 1929) and Persia (Tehran, the 23rd August, 1929). Additional to the above, Saudi Arabia is in general treaty relations with Great Britain (Jedda, the 20th May, 1927) and Afghanistan (Mecca, the 5th May, 1932, ratifications exchanged the 1st April, 1934). Soviet Russia and the Netherlands are in relations with Saudi Arabia and maintain representatives at Jedda without having concluded formal treaties. Egypt and Belgium maintain consular representatives at Jedda, the former without having formally recognised the present regime. Czechoslovakia is represented at Jedda by an honorary consul of Saudi nationality. [Note. —Since this report was drawn up, a treaty between Egypt and Saudi Arabia has been signed (the 7th May, 1936) at Cairo.* Article 5 provides for the co-operation of the Egyptian Government in carrying out certain works of repairs, &amp;c., in respect of the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina, in regard to roads used by pilgrims, &amp;c. Article 6 provides for early negotiation of customs, postal and navigation agreements.] IV.— Finance. (a) Review of the Years 1926-35. Economic development is entirely dependent on the length of the Saudi purse, as the Government is seldom in a position to meet more than one or two seemingly necessary payments at once. No statistics are published, or it is believed, compiled. No budget has been published, except in January 1932, when an estimate of expenditure by various departments in the Hejaz was printed, but without indication of estimated revenue. It is therefore only possible to judge the state of the country’s finance by rough estimation and the attitude of the Government to their larger debts. \\ hen in 1923 the subsidy which His Majesty’s Government had paid to ibn baud since 1917 ceased, Xejd was left a poor country able to exist as it had one through the ages by petty trading and, when things w^ere bad, by raiding ai ? • ^Hare but without means to pay for western machines, arms and cars to which the influx of money during the Great War had accustomed the northern Fi 11 S °h tu penmsu f’ ^. Pe ^' e j az 5 on the other hand, was comparatively wealthy through the proceeds of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, and might have prospered under more enlightened rule than that of King Hussein It was therefore to the Hejaz that King Abdul Aziz looked for revenue once the two States were uni ed under his rule. On his election as King of the Heiaz in 1926. he assumed control of the military forces of the country and assured the safetv l l l ro Ai.s.f'r.h''‘Ms 5 “c««r *■“ mum sol, I in hi. capacity of Kin, ,„d Comm.nde “n-S ihich” « approximately the amount of the subsidy p ai d him from 1917 to 1M2 bv His Majesty s Government. ^ ^ But even with the conquest of the Heiaz, finanop ^ n i • In Nejd the war had to be paid for by distributions to the tribes 'in'the^Heia? the new broom was sweeping clean and requiring money. There were ne« coir han of z fric witi fon Moi ind&lt; Hej bur earl ind the seri fina wei imf nun the pi4 pil; 193 to z Hu buc Go 1 wh try top 193 pro by loc; Thi 13t pro 35 dev rev stn beg not pre cab it exp mei goo to c gen issi dra imj in dec to rec sea ofcoinage, motoi cais, condensers and other improvements to be paid for on the one hand, and the reduction of pilgrim and customs dues on the other. The economy of administering a dual kingdom was not so great as might have been thought; friction between the fanatical Nejdis and the easy going Hejazis led to the withdrawal of Wahhabi soldiers, and necessitated the organisation of a Hejaz force at a cost probably in excess of the £140,000 per annum mentioned above. Moreover, the King now found himself in touch with the outside world; indemnities had to be paid to individuals for the loss of property during the Hejaz-Nejd war, and the Moslem Conference convoked at Mecca brought its burden to the 1 reasury. lo meet these expenses the Government had to resort early to loans from merchants, the reduction of pay of civil servants and the indirect increase of dues to pilgrims. The boom pilgrimage years of 1927 and 1928 would have gone far to restore the situation if political events in Nejd in 1928-29 had not faced the King with serious rebellions in the centre and north-eastern part of the country. The financial situation, instead of ameliorating, grew steadily worse. Forced levies were raised from the pacified Hejaz tribes, new taxes on rent and on shopkeepers imposed. Government bills were paid by transferable drafts on customs so numerous that they became realisable only at a heavy discount. By these means the Government managed to tide over matters until the 1929 pilgrimage. The restoration of internal peace in 1930 was off-set by the fall in the pilgrimage caused chiefly by the world economic crisis. In 1927 132,109 overseas pilgrims came to the country. By 1930 the figure had fallen to 84,821. When in 1931 the pilgrimage fell by over 50 per cent, on the 1930 figures, matters came to a head. In June a national conference of urban dwellers was convened in the Hej az, and criticisms of the financial administration, including the absence of a budget, were expressed. The situation was aggravated by the inability of the Government to maintain the value of the Saudi silver riyal to the gold pound, to which it was legally tied (see sub-section (c) below), making matters impossible by trying to pay out at the official rate and to charge at the devalued rate. When on top of this internal crisis Great Britain went off the gold standard in September 1931, the Government were unable to tackle the situation further save by prohibiting the export of gold. The financial straits of the Government became manifest to all in September by the commandeering without notice or payment of the stocks of petrol held by local firms in the Government storage at Jedda to meet Government requirements. The resultant wave of indignation induced the King to issue a proclamation (the 13th November, 1931) promising budgetary reform for the Hejaz. The proclamation gave the future percentage allocation of revenue to expendituie . 35 per cent, administration, 25 per cent, debt liquidation, 2o per cent, economic development, 15 per cent, reserve. No attempt at estimating the amount of revenue was made, which is perhaps somewhat inevitable so long as the economic structure of the country depends entirely on the vagaries of a religious pilgrimage. The budget was eventually published in January 1932 to cover the lunar year beginning with the 12th December, 1931. It related to the Hejaz only, and was not only the first but also the last to be published. As stated above, the budget presumed the revenue without indicating its sources As expenditure was calculated in piastres miri, some at the fixed gold rate and some at the silver rate it was difficult to calculate the sterling equivalent of the total estimated expenditure. It probably amounted to about £835.000 gold The percentages mentioned in the Royal proclamation were not maintained. In spite of this a goodly sum was reallocated for debt remission, but brought 1 e r P , to creditors. Officials; salaries continued to fall into arrear and were added to ffie general Government indebtedness. On the 17th June, •’ wonld he met bv issued to the effect that debts not already provided for otherwise wouW be met by drafts on customs. Creditors such as Government servants had to designate imnort merchants to receive and handle drafts on their behalf. Matters remained In^this MsatfsTactorj^TtEd* all the year, and in the autumn a moratorium was ^''Hotever black the outlook was in 1932, the Go tXoTpZfwas' to put matters straight The mmappiopna wn^ ^ revenue we ' re eagerly rectified in November by agreement.

Not all the schemes projected during 1932 and 1933 to bring grist to the Saudi mill materialised. The State bank came to nothing. A concession to build the Jedda to Mecca Railway languished and was finally cancelled. But one prospered. An oil concession was granted in 1933 to the Standard Oil Company of California, bringing in immediate revenue in return for prospecting rights This windfall compensated somewhat for the further decrease in the overseas pilgrimage which fell to 20,705 pilgrims. The deterioration of political relations with the Yemen, however, which led to the outbreak of war in May 1934, caused the King to husband carefully all the revenue he was able in order to cover the cost of war preparations. The unsatisfactory state of Government indebtedness and the arrears of salaries remained therefore as before. Economies, new taxes, a slightly increased pilgrimage in 1934 and further payments on account of the oil concession enabled the Government successfully to tide over the war period and to make on the return of peace handsome distribution to the combatant tribes. The tendency to improvement continued through 1935. The number of overseas pilgrims again increased to 33,898 and the customs receipts seemed to have shown a corresponding rise. Exports received an unexpected fillip by the sale of 1,000 camels at a good price to the Italian Government for service in Eritrea A further economy was made at the expense of the Saudi official salaries being cut m the early summer by 25 per cent., and arrangements made whereby one-third of the reduced salary should be paid in kind. Efforts have been made to get away from giving drafts on customs, and such drafts when given aie, since 1932, non-transferable. Especially noticeable as a healthy sign of improved conditions has been the repayment of part of the foreign debts liabilities ^ mCreaSed readmess on the Part of the Government to meet current ♦ (b) Revenue and Expenditure.

To meet the situation the Government ordered from the United Kingdom “/om nfJTT C ° ,n ? ge ’ th6 Saudl rl J al or dollar - 400 .0M riyals, 100,000 KriyX and 200,000 }-riyals were imported. Owing to the shortage of silver and 'the oncoming pilgrimage, the Government had no difficulty in getting money changers to accept the new coinage. The Turkish coins were not withdrawn, but ceased to be lega ten er To regulate the new currency a Hejaz Nejd currency regulation was published to come into force on the 23rd January, 1928. The regulation established two standards, the English gold sovereign and the silver riyal similar in composition and weight to the old Turkish Mejidieh with provision for Wal parity of 220 baudi piastres equal to 10 Saudi riyals equal to £1 °-old. ° The Government s currency policy was successful during 1928 Parity between nickel, silver and gold was roughly maintained, the pound not falling below 218 piastres. Success did not continue. More cupro-nickel coins were imported in 1928 and silver and cupro-nickel coins in 1929-30. Added to this increase in silver coinage there was a tendency on the part of the Government noticeable alieadv in 1928, to hoard the gold, probably necessary for remittances to Nejd, and to flood the market with silver coinage when makino 1 any payment however large, riyals being legal tender up to any amount. These factors combined with the world rise in gold in 1931. The riyal depreciated m March of that year to below 13 to the pound. The Government took steps to bring it back to parity by forbidding the export of gold and making arrangements with the Netherlands Trading Society of Jedda so that thev accepted unlimited riyals and sold foreign drafts in gold at the official rate less commission. This, although temporarily successful, failed through the lack of sufficient gold backing by the Government. In April 1931 the nickel coinage broke away from the silver riyal and slumped badly, causing serious loss to the poorer pilgrims then in the country. Parity was restored by the Government, with the help of money raised by a committee of merchants, withdrawing about £24,000 worth of nickel coins. When on top of these internal crisis Great Britain went off the gold standard in September 1931, the riyal seemed to follow sterling and depreciated to 18 to the gold pound and lower. The Government then gave up attempting to keep the riyal at par of exchange, any attempt towards which they had already stultified by trying to pay out silver at the legal rate and to receive at the depreciated rate. Since 1931, therefore, the riyal has fluctuated according to supply and demand, falling to 24 to the gold pound and rising to 18 to the gold pound. During the summer of 1931 the Government had tried one more solution, not mentioned above, to restore the value of the riyal, that of making it current in Nejd as well as in the Hejaz. This failed, the Nejdi tribesman accepted the Saudi piastre, but rejected the Saudi riyal. The Maria Theresa dollar was the standard coin of Nejd and could not be superseded by the riyal, which was unacceptable in Iraq, Koweit and Bahrein, whence all the purchases of Nejd came. So unwelcome is the riyal still in Nejd that in 1935 it was changeable in Riyadh for not more than 18 piastres Saudi. In other towns of Nejd the discount was probably greater. Owing to the unpopularity of the riyal in Nejd, the Government has had to introduce the Indian rupee in ever increasing quantities to replace the disap pearing Maria Theresa dollar. Tbo rupee has long been used in Hasa and, being the currency of Bahrein and Koweit and known in Iraq, is well acceptable to the Bedouin and the townspeople alike. It is now, combined with the use o Saudi piastres, the chief coinage in use. The Maria Theresa dollar is thus being relegated to the south-west corner of the kingdom, Asir. , , In Hasa the tawila, a brass piece shaped somewhat like a nail and worth half an anna, is a survival of more primitive days and is disappearing rom use. The quantity of gold in Saudi Arabia may be said to be almost stationary Gold rates follow the London market, but owing to a wnstanpocal demand the rate is generally slightly dearer in Arabia. In spite of is lere i14 * of gold, except when special payments are made to the Government, owing to the export regulations in other countries. The export of gold from Saudi Arabia was forbidden outright in the spring of 1931, but the regulation was later modified and gold may now be exported with Government permission. Gold remains the currency for all large transactions such as the payment of rents. In the Hejaz, English notes, Egyptian notes and currency and to a less extent the rupee are in general circulation in the towns. [Note.— Since this report was prepared the Saudi Ministry of Finance, on the 23rd March, 1936, issued a notice readjusting the relation between Saudi piastres and the other elements in the currency by calculating the pound gold at 20 Saudi riyals, the Saudi riyal at 11 Saudi piastres and making 1 Saudi piastre = 2 nickel piastres. The main effects appear to be the establishment of a new legal parity of the existing riyal for the purpose of transactions with the Government, or the abolition of the “ miri ” piastre. Later, new Saudi riyals (to the value of 1 million Saudi riyals), minted in the United Kingdom, arrived at Jedda. These coins are of the same size, weight and fineness as the Indian rupee, and are, there fore, considerably smaller in size than the old Saudi riyal. No steps have yet been taken, as far as is known, to have the latter withdrawn from circulation.] (d) Banking. Banking business is done by Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) and the Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij (Netherlands Trading Trading Society), both of which have branches established in Jedda. Other firms°, Messrs. International Agencies (Limited), Haji Abdullah Alireza and Company undertake banking transactions from time to time. According to the Sharia law and confirmed by the King in a decree of 1926, it is illegal to charge interest on loans or bank deposits. When the former are made, an agent’s commission is therefore payable instead. Few native merchants open accounts with banking firms, and business is chiefly confined to buying and selling of drafts, collecting debts and exchange work. The •‘ Hundi' system, whereby pilgrims buy in Egypt or Indian drafts on merchants in the Hejaz, is still used to a certain extent. The Saudi Arab Government have long flirted with the idea of a State bank, which would be able to finance their needs. When Ibn Saud conquered the Hejaz in 1926 he confirmed a Hashimite decree of 1925 giving the Amir Habib Lotfallah the right to establish the Arabian National Bank of the Hejaz, with powers to carry on all usual banking business and also to issue currency notes. The latter, it was hoped, could be guaranteed on customs receipts and other Government revenue. \\ ith the increasing financial depression of the following years there was little reason why such a scheme should succeed. Notes were printed, but never issued. The bank continued to exist in Jedda on a very modest scale for several years, but no longer opens for business. Ihe Netherlands Trading Society opened a branch in Jedda in November 1926, the first purely banking establishment of a serious nature to come to the Hejaz since the disappearance of the Ottoman Bank in the first few years of the Hashimite regime. The idea of a State bank was revived early in 1932 through the Government’s desire for a financial loan, apparently unobtainable elsewhere \n agreement between a representative of the ex-Khedive Abbas Hilmi Pasha and the Saudi o^ernment was announced in the official Mecca paper, the Umm-al-Qura, on the Uth March, 1933 The ex-Khedive was, however, unable to confirm the agreement, and the scheme fell through in 1934 after a further attempt on the part of his representative to obtain backing on his own account in the city of London.

In 1935 howevw a conference met at Haifa to discuss the technical side only. It dispersed a&lt;min without achieving agreement. ,r F i ^ ai J ; J vay ’ wh en first built by the Turks, was planned to continue beyond Medina to Mecca. This project, at first held up by the hostility of the tribes, has now become secondary to the recommissioning of the existing line. A project for a railway between Jedda and Mecca has for many years attracted the interests of capitalists. A 60-mile line through foothills with an assured trafhc would seem to be an attractive proposal, but in spite of repeated announcements of projects and even concessions the scheme has never even resulted in a survey. The sensitiveness of the religious Moslem and the Nationalist Arab to any non-Moslem or foreign penetration has been the greatest obstacle to the realisation of this idea. (b) Roads and Road Transport. Railways in Arabia are likely to be less heard of in the future owing to the rapid development of motor transport. The desert serves for the most part as a natural road for light cars and trucks, if not for heavily laden lorries, and by its use quick communications are established with the minimum of capital outlay. The conquest of the Hejaz by Ibn Saud and the consequent pacification of its unruly tribes enabled the King to substitute car traffic for camel traffic as the chief transport of pilgrims. Private car companies rapidly increased, and the number of cars imported each year has become considerable. In 1935 the Government amalgamated all existing car companies into the “ Arab Car Service,” a company which has a monopoly for carrying fare-paying passengers throughout the country, but probably effectively only in the Hejaz. The amalgamated company is sub-divided into two divisions, the first, the former independent companies, and the second, the former Government companies. The Government have a contract with the local representative of the Ford motor company (see VII (iv) below), whereby only Fords are purchased for the ‘‘Arab Car Service.” The Government finance the purchase of cars for the “public” division of the company, and in return have first call on them and pay nothing. The “ private ” division of the company seems to have little working capital, and is thus left with old cars. The scheme has many defects in operation, but may outgrow them in due course. Merchandise is still almost completely carried by camel or on shorter distances by donkey. Both cars and camels follow age-old tracks from well to well. Camel roads lead everywhere and need not be enumerated. I he most used car roads are those following the traditional pilgrim routes in the Hejaz—Jedda to Mecca and Jedda to Medina. In 1927 an attempt was made at metalling the former by taking stones from the neighbouring hills and rolling them in with a steam-roller imported from the United Kingdom. The road was never a success, and once constructed no attempt was made at upkeep. With time the metalling has disappeared below the sand, and now, eight years later, there is little to show of the road save an occasional projecting boulder. Besides the Hejaz loads, the road from Mecca to Riyadh and across to Hufuf is also well used, and the woist gradients have been engineered by the Government. Petrol and oil dumps are maintained by the Government along this road at Muwaih and Dawadimi. One other road worthy of special note is the pilgrimage road from ^ajaf in Iraq through Hail to Medina, which was opened to motor traffic for the 1935 pilgrimage by agreement with the Iraqi Government. A sen ice is mam a me during the pilgrimage season only by Iraqi-owned cars as far as Medina. Onward transport to Mecca is by the Arab Car Service. . kl f The only traditional pilgrim route which is still impracticable to motor traffic is the Darb-ash-Sham, from Medina to Damascus along the disused He a Z railwav line The portion between Tabuk and A1 1 la passed thiough high mountains and lava deserts, and is only passable at great cost to veffi The King has, however, promised to examine the possibihties of &lt;^emng a road a g this route if negotiations for the recommissioning o e 7 • • • Thp Government have always shown interest in the possibility ot improving their ,tit from . mM* Clw’Strf ‘S” where the comfort of pilgrims is concerned from a financial point of view.1)1 I 1 M ' ' 16 1935 the Shell Company of Egypt surfaced a sample 100 metres of asphalt road outside the walls of Jedda on behalf of the Banque Misr, who have been in negotiation during the last years with the Saudi Coyernment oyer various economic and charitable projects. It is not known at the time of writing whether they will reach agreement for the construction or improvement of the Jedda- Mecca road. Independent of the Government, the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, who are commencing the exploitation of gold at Mahd-adh-Dhahab, are building a road from Jedda direct to the mine, the first road of any length to be constructed as such in the country. The road is engineered but unsurfaced, and is approximately 220 miles in length. (c) Ports. There are no constructed harbours in Saudi Arabia. Ports are anchorages, of which some are navigable by steamship, but most only by dhows. Jedda is’ the principal port both for the pilgrimage and general commerce and the only pert of importance in the kingdom. It is visited regularly by vessels of the Khedivial Mail Steamship Company (British) and of the Compania Tirrhenia (Italian). For other lines, see the commercial summary. 1930 Entered: British ....

All cargo has to be transhipped, the lighterage being done lateen-sailed dhows. Harbour improvement at Jedda has been talked of hut without result. The reefs are marked by beacons, which are kept in repair by the Coastguard Depart ment, but the absence of lights makes the harbour practicable only between sunrise and sunset. The channel through the reefs, by which lighters come to the quay, badly needs dredging. In the monsoon season when the water is low, even the smallest craft cannot make the channel without scraping the bottom. Cargo in dhows has often to he partly transhipped midway between ship and quay. Within the next ten years, as the busy season of the port—the pilgrimage season— recedes into the summer and as the coral grows, the position will become critical. The alternatives which appear to offer themselves are the dredging of the channel for lighters or the construction of a pier on the coral reefs out into the inner anchorage. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate propose to build a short quay into deep water in the inner anchorage a few miles to the north of Jedda, in order to facilitate the landing of their equipment. Work on this project has not yet begun, but if it is carried out it might be developed and revolutionise the conditions of the whole port. Of other ports Wejh and Yanbu are visited regularly by Khedivial mail steamers. Yanbu, the port of Medina, is marked with beacons similar to those at Jedda. Rabigh, Lith, Qunfidha and Jizan, on the Red Sea, have also been visited by steamships from time to time. Rabigh is the best natural port of the Hejaz, but unlike Jedda and Yanbu, having no considerable town in its hinterland, it is rarely visited. On the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia has a low lying sandy coast with only one natural harbour suitable for large craft at Ras Tanura, to the north-west of Bahrein. All imports come through Koweit, on the one hand, or Bahrein, with transhipment to Qatif and Uqair, on the other. The possibility of developing Ras Tanura has therefore not been overlooked by the Government. Ras Tanura is a ridge of sandhills which projects into the sea for about 9 miles. It is about 35 miles by road and 10 by water from the nearest town Qatif. There is anchorage in depths of 30-39 feet at a distance of 1 cable from the shore, which can be approached with safety by ships drawing up to 18 feet. In 1933 a pier 100 feet long was built and a large shed erected on shore. 1 here are, however, difficulties to be faced, among them the supply of fresh water, and it is doubtful whether, in view of the small trade involved, it would repay the Government to spend a large amount of money in the creation of a proper port. Apart from steamship ports there are many creeks and breaks in the coral reefs the length of the Red Sea where sea-going dhows can come to the shore. Slaving vessels and vessels carrying African pilgrims have since time immemorial known these ports. The present regime has, however, realised the desirability of controlling this traffic, and have made a start at coastguarding. By official communique No. 1 of the 20th June, 1935, sailing vessels are only allowed to load and unload at fourteen Red Sea ports : Dhaba, Wejh, Umm Lajj, Tanbu, Rabigh, A1 Qadhima, Tuwal, Jedda, Lith, Qunfidha, A1 Birk, A1 Qahma, Jizand and Farsan. _ -n ^ On the Persian Gulf coast sailing vessels call, as well as at Ras lanura mentioned above, at Uqair, Qatif, Darin and Jubail. Of these, Uqair, the port linking Hasa to Bahrein, is the chief, with stone-built warehouses and a pier a which boats can come alongside even at low tide. Qatif and Jubail are also equipped with storage warehouses and piers, but can only be approached at hig water. [13788] DIn no port in Saudi Arabia are mechanical means for handling goods available. (d) Coastal Shipping. The Khedivial Mail line calls at Wejh and \ anbu, as well as at Jedda, carrying Saudi Government mails and passengers. This is the only regular coastal service in Saudi Arabia. r _ 7 On the 5th May, 1934, the Mecca newspaper announced the establishment of a national company, the Arab Steam Navigation Lonipany,” registered at Jedda. It was stated that the company's steamers would ply between national ports on the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The company is a semi- private Government-controlled concern, the manager and several of the shareholders being prominent people in Government service. It is understood that the Government undertakes to guarantee any loss on working. Two ships were originally bought, but the second seems to have been returned or resold. The remaining ship Al Fath, approximately 150 tons, has not as yet ventured outside the Red Sea. Dhow traffic is still considerable in the Red Sea, and a good number trade beyond Saudi ports, especially to Mukalla and the Iladhramaut. The regulations on fishing published in July and August 1932 apply in some aspects to such traffic. (e) Aviation (see Map III( 1 )). There are no air services in Saudi Arabia, although the Imperial Airways India route passes off the coast of Hasa. There are, however, landing grounds of varying efficiency on the Jinnah and Darin Islands off the Hasa Coast, at Riyadh (marked out but never yet used), Taif, the headquarters of the small Saudi air force, Jedda, Yanbu, Wejh and Medina. The last four are not permanently marked. The Saudi air force consists of some old De Havilland machines taken over from King Hussein, which are no longer serviceable, four Wapitis supplied by His Majesty’s Government in 1929, of which three are still in use, and one Caudron Renault Pelican monoplane given to the King by the French Government in March 1936. In 1930-31 an Arab Aeronautical Society was formed to create public interest both in military and civil flying. In 1932 it was announced that the society had received funds amounting to £2,094 gold, of which £1,751 gold were contributed as gifts chiefly by the King and the Amir Feisal, and £343 gold raised by annual subscriptions by members. In 1935 the society sent a number of students to Italy to train as pilots, but no further purchase of equipment had been made. Whether the Arab Aeronautical Society will confine its activities to supporting the national air force and will leave the future of civil aviation in Saudi Arabia to external interests remains to be seen. Meanwhile, it is engaged in promoting, at the time of writing, the collection of subscriptions in Mecca, Jedda, Riyadh and Medina for the purchase of aircraft to be named after these cities. Enquiries in this respect have already been made from Moslems in connexion with the pilgrimage, and experimental flights have been made from time to time from Cairo to Jedda. In January 1936 the first aeroplane of the Misr Airwork (Limited) landed at Medina, and ar rangements may be completed in the near future for a seasonal service from Cairo to the Holy Cities. [Note.— Since this report was prepared three small aeroplanes for training purposes and civil uses arrived in Jedda, having been offered by the Italian Hoyernment. Further machines are expected, and an Italian instructor has arrived. ] (f) Posts. . .J he Hejaz-Nejd Government joined the International Postal Union in 19S refill ?! TeC TT° n the fr.

In 19*27 four employees were sent for training in various branches of work to Palestine. A Government commission of inspection was appointed to survey the working of the administration in 1935; the results are not yet known. External postal communications have been arranged from Jedda with the Sudan, Eritrea and Egypt by the Khedivial Mail and the Tirrhenia Lines, assuring a weekly service both ways to Egypt and the Sudan; a direct mail bag is now sent from the London General Post Office to Jedda. A daily service runs from Hufuf to Bahrein by agreement with the Indian Post Office, and efforts are at present being made to make a similar agreement for a ten-day mail from Jizan to Kamaran. Internal posts are either by car or by camel, the latter in the interior being probably only irregularly run. Post offices have been established at Mecca, Jedda, Medina, Rabigh, Yanbu, Wejh, Dhahba, A1 Ula, Tabuk, Lith, Qunfidha, Abha, Jizan, Ghamid, Taif, Riyadh, Hufuf and Jubail, practically all of which, it will be noticed, are in the Hejaz. A daily motor service runs between Jedda and Mecca, and during the summer between Mecca and Taif. There is a bi-weekly service between Jedda, Rabigh and Medina and a fortnightly service between Mecca and Riyadh. The Khedivial Mail Line carry weekly mails between Jedda, Yanbu and Wejh without charge to the Government. Regular camel post connects the post offices at Riyadh (Hufuf and Jubail; A1 Ula^and Wejd; Yanbu and Medina; Taif and Ghamid; Mecca and Lith, whence mail is distributed also by camel to Qunfidha, Jizan, Abba and Najran. As with other Saudi Government departments no statistics are published regularly. The only statement concerning the Hejaz postal figures was published in the tlmm-al-Qura in the spring of 1929. According to this statement the value of mails carried during the preceding year was— (L) Registered and insured parcels— Gold Francs.

D 2 [13788]The external wireless communications of Saudi Arabia are governed by the agreement signed on the 17th April, 1935, between the Government and the Eastern Telegraph Company (Limited) and Cable and Wireless (Limited) (see also below). By that agreement the Saudi Arab Government bound themselves not to use their wireless stations for external communications, save with stations belonging to Cable and Wireless (Limited) and for communications originating from or terminating in the neighbouring Arabian States, including Syria. Telegraphs .—Besides wireless, Saudi Arabia is connected with the outside world by the Jedda cable to Port Sudan, which is the joint property of the Sudan and Saudi Arab Governments (agreement signed the 18th December, 1926, with His Majesty’s Government as a third party) and is operated by the Eastern Telegraph Company (Limited) under an agreement between them and Cable and Wireless (Limited) on the one hand and the two owners on the other, signed on the 17th April, 1935. Telephones .—Services are operated in Jedda, Mecca and Taif, which three towns are inter-connected by land-line, and in Medina and Riyadh. The majority of the wireless stations mentioned above are fit for wireless telephony; notably, the palaces at Mecca and Riyadh are directly connected by such means. The telephone service in Mecca, Medina and Jedda dates from the Turkish times. That in Riyadh was installed in 1932. In 1934 the Soviet Government presented to the Administration of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones twenty-five automatic telephones, with a central, which were installed in the Government offices at Taif. VI.—Natural Resources and Industry. (a) Agriculture. Saudi Arabia, in spite of its large area and small population, is unable to support itself with cultivated produce. This does not mean, however, that the country is completely desert or that cultivation is unknown. In vast areas water is not forthcoming, but in others, especially in parts of the Hejaz, the Wadi Sirhan and Hasa, water is plentiful above and below the surface of the soil, while in still other areas the potentialities of creating a water supply are great. In these last areas, the development has, however, been arrested until recent years by the lack of security, and is still crippled by the ignorance, apathy and poverty of the inhabitants. Even were these overcome by enlightened Government and education, the lack of considerable markets and the difficulties of transport would probably vitiate any economic return to the capital outlay. The development of agriculture and the settlement of Bedouin must in Arabia remain a political rather than an economic problem. i his was the case with the so-called Hijra movement, started by the present King in Nejd; that is, the settlement of Wahhabi tribesmen in villages (hijra = flight), of which Artiwiya was the first and remains the principal. One is tempted to give a greater economic significance than is perhaps warranted to this evidence of enlightened policy in Central Arabia. To the contrary, although information concerning the sixty-odd settlements so founded is scant, it would piobably be moie correct to account the movement, as an agricultural movement, a failure rather than a success. Agriculture is only developed in the cultivation of dates. Instruments arc the ci udest, e\en the plough being unknown, save in the Hejaz. In recent years, pumping machinery has been imported (chiefly Better engines) to draw water in the palm groves of Riyadh and Medina. The interest of the Government in agi icultuie is e\idenced by the facts that such machinery is imported duty free, and that the Government distributes seeds to cultivators from time.to time. Little is known of cultivation in Asir and Najran, but they are probably more extensively cultivated than other parts of the kingdom, the rainfall being greater. The Hejaz contains numerous villages in its valleys cultivating dates” wheat and barley and fruits. Noteworthy are the region round Taif with its grapes, apricots and pomegranates, its honey, its wheat and barley, the Wadi Fatima, Yanbu and Nakhl and Medina, with their extensive palm groves The Wadi Fatima, where there is an ancient system of irrigation, also supplies Mecca and Jedda with limited vegetables—spinach (silliq), rice and beans P Medina as an agricultural centre has lost much of its pre-war importance- wheat and(c) Fishing and Sea Products. Regulations concerning fishing and diving for pearls, mother-of-pearl, coral, cowries and sea slugs in Red Sea waters were published in July/August 1932 Jizan, Birk, Qunfidha, Lith, Jedda, Rabigh, Yanbu, Umm Lajj, Wejh and Dhaba are named as ports from which fishing may be undertaken. Licences are necessary, and the products are taxed on being landed. Little fishing is done by the natives except for their own purposes and up and down the coast. The coastal market is limited, and fish will not carry to the larger towns of the interior. Crayfish are occasionally exported from Wejh to Egypt. The Persian Gulf is famous for pearl fishing, but that industry is centred round the islands of Bahrein and only affects Saudi Arabia indirectly. Native divers fish for pearls on the Red Sea coast, but they have no idea of conserving the beds which, as a result, contain small-sized shells of little value. The offer of the Saudi Arab Government in 1934 to grant Sheikh Abdurrahman Qusaibi, a member of the foremost pearl merchant family of Bahrein, a monopoly for pearl fishing on the Red Sea coast, led to the survey of the coast from Wejh to Jizan and the Farsan Islands by a party of Venezuelan divers. The concession was not taken up. Other sea products are mother-of-pearl and coral (black coral is especially prized and used for making into rosaries), which are collected by individual native fishermen, also sea slugs (“ Beche de mer ”), which are not at present fished in quantity, although, it is believed, natives on the Sudan coast do a certain amount of trade in this “delicacy” with China. The commercial treaty of 1932 with Italy has a clause ensuring to Italian and Eritrean fishing vessels most-favoured-nation treatment. (d) Industries. Saudi industry as an economic factor is negligible. In the tribal areas it is little more than the production of the simpler necessities of Bedouin life. In the more advanced Hejaz towns the pilgrimage provides for all, and industry not connected with it is at a discount. Bedouin tents are made of goat or camel hair, and ropes of palm fibre. Shamlas, rough pileless rugs, are woven by the Bedouin women, and are vegetable dyed. I he best Arab cloaks, made of camel hair (Mishlah), come from Nejd. but are adorned with gold or silver thread imported from Germany and India. Foreign gold thread and silver silk thread are also required for the grander type iqal (head ropes), which are made in Mecca and Taif. Copper long- routed coffee pots are made in Hasa, Medina and Mecca; in the Hejaz, however, those of better quality are imported from the Yemen. The copper used in the otal manufacture of these articles is imported from India. Sandals of camel leather, saddle-bags of sheep and goat hair, and palm-leaf and palm-fibre mats, &lt;ins and basket work are other products of small native labour, none of which is exported. at a- u T tW i° md ; jstries of more modern kind are found in Mecca, Jedda a: Medina, but the only one which can be said to be run as a normal commerc: enterprise is the mineral water factory at Jedda. At Meooa the Government established in 1927 a factory for the weaving Kiswa (holy carpet to cover the Kaaba), following on a dispute with Egypt the annual despatch of the traditional Mahmal. which previously included t . , ;' a ,, . factory was founded with men and material from India, but owi: fbebilt f,f n t r? eSS1Ve - yearS ', haS , now heen P ut in ch arge of Hejazi weave from Modern ^ Lswa A m ported m the first years from Germany, is now suppli a h ® C0St of . weavm g the carpet in Mecca is believed to mentarv mL h f gh t An /^Pt ln to utilise the factory for the supp: mental y manufacture of carpets, of the type of the Indian ‘ ‘ durri ” was t “Ki wT'^nd lif he hlgh f°k S v A subsidiary industry to the local weavi, Adpd fk L k k establlsh ed by the Government, is that of embroide g ***?,*'* *»»■■&gt;».

Complete political independence with the resultant stoppage of all foreign subsidies, Turkish or British, has forced Saudi Arabia to look for new sources of revenue to supplement the precarious pilgrimage. For some years the Saudi Arab Government allowed themselves to be hampered by the theory that con cessions should be given to Moslems only, a theory endorsed by the Heinz National Conference of 1931, but abandoned since 1933 by virtue of the grant in that year of an oil concession in Hasa to the Standard Oil Company of Califoi ilia and in 1934 of a mining concession in the Hejaz to a British syndicate. Fhiee aieas of the present Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have attracted at one time or another the attention of oil interests: Midian, in the Northern Heinz- Asir, the Farsan Islands in particular; and the Persian Gulf Coast. An inchoate concession for oil drilling in an area covering parts of the Northern Hejaz and parts of territory now in Transjordan and Palestine, was said to have been granted by the Ottoman Government to a British companv before the war, but the concession never took definite form. Since the attainment of Arab independence no concession has been taken up for this area, although individuals have shown interest from time to time. In 1920 a short prospecting journey for oil and other minerals was undertaken between Wejh and Dhaba by a small British party, while more thorough investigations, perhaps, were made in roughly the same region by the American, Mr. K. S. Twitched, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government in 1931, and by American geologists on behalf of the Standard Oil Company of California in 1934. Mr. Twitched in his report (published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 14th August, 1931) mentioned the area between Umm Lajj and Muwada in particular as productive of oil, but it is said that the actual area is too small to be operated in with profit. In Asir matters progressed further by the actual grant in 1926 of a concession for oil in the Farsan Islands by the then ruler of Asir, the Idrissi, to the Bed Sea Petroleum Company, but following on a dispute between the two parties, in which Ibn Saud acted as arbitrator, the company withdrew in 1928, having been unable to start experimental borings. The discovery of oil in Bahrein in 1932 attracted the attention of the oil world to the possibilitv on the Arab mainland to the west of the Persian Gulf. In this Saudi Arabia is concerned in two separate political areas—the Province of Hasa, an integral part of the kingdom, and the Koweit Neutral Zone, a condominium of King Abdul Aziz and the Sheikh of Koweit. In 1933 (the 29th May) the Saudi Arab Government granted a concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, who also hold the concession in Bahrein, for the exploitation of oil in Hasa. I he exact extent of the concession area has not been published. A new company, the California Arabian Standaid Oil Company was formed, with a head office in London, and started diilling at the end of 1934 at Jebel Dhahran, near Qatif. Oil has not yet been obtained m commercial quantities, although prospects are said to be satisfactoiy. No concession has been as yet granted by the co-rulers in respect of the vowei Neutral Zone. (f) Gold and other Minerals. Very little of the total area of Saudi Arabia has been surveyed for mineral wealth, although parties of prospectors, including the explorei, R- F- B ™ton (1877), whose adventures are recorded m his book //^ known to have visited the Hejaz from time to time. n e &amp; . ’ &amp; included in 1920 a party of four Syrians, whose knowiedge^^s geoiogists does not seem to have impressed even King Hussein. Ihe in g&gt; , lf , ’ ^ i • to one expert discourse on the valuable proper ics o adesert, made him carry its 40 lb. weight the 2 miles back to his camp; the epithet then used for the stone was no longer k ‘ valuable.” A large stride forward was taken, however, when the Saudi Arab Government accepted the offer of the American philanthropist, Mr. Crane, for the loan of an engineer, Mr. K. § Twitched, to make a rapid survey in 1931 and 1932 over large areas, especially in the Hejaz. The object of the survey was to look into water possibilities anil to examine the potential mineral resources of the country. Mr. Twitchelfs report was published in various numbers of the Umm-al-Qura, and mentions the discovery in different parts of the Hejaz of traces of mica, iron, talc, gypsum, lead and gold. On the 23rd December, 1934, Mr. Twitched, on behalf of the newly-formed British-Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, obtained a concession from the Saudi Arab Government to prospect for two years for metallic minerals of ad kinds in an area of varying depth, extending from Birk in Asir to the Hejaz-Trans- jordan frontier, and to form subsidiary companies within that period to work any particular areas the syndicate thought profitable to take up. The syndicate is especially interested in gold at the ancient disused mines at Mahd-adh-Dhahab (“ Cot of Gold ”), between Mecca and Medina. Considerable work has been done in order to connect the mine at Madh-adh-Dhahab with Jedda by road, and to start drilling there under the necessary subsidiary company. Both the mining syndicate and the Saudi x\rab Government are optimistic about prospects. Besides Mahd-adh-Dhahab there are old gold mines in the neighbourhood of Wejh, and traces of the metal have also been found near Taif. VII.— Foreign Trade. (a) Exports and Tribal Commerce. Besides Egyptian, Indian and Javanese currency notes and coinage, brought by the pilgrims, the exports of Saudi Arabia consist of hides and skins, intestines (in very small quantities to Germany), live-stock and the meagre products of Bedouin industry and agriculture (most of which has been detailed in Section VI above). Ihe whole is of little and decreasing value, the imports of the country being paid for by the revenue of the pilgrimage and payments by foreign con- cessionnaires. Exports through Jedda have been recently valued, unofficially, at about £13,500 per lunar year. In 1934 a company called the ” Arabian Export Company ” was formed in Mecca with many of the highest Government officials on the list of shareholders. The company appears to have done little business so far, although it is still in existence and calling for more subscribers. Contrary to the movement of imports, a greater value of exports pass over the land frontiers than through ports, in the form of small tribal trading, called musabila Every year at the end of the summer and after the date crop has been picked, there is a regular move of tribes from Nejd towards the Euphrates, o arbala, JNajaf, Samawa, Nasiriya, Khamisiya and Zubair, where they purchase their needs for the winter season, after selling what goods they them- sc yes a\e to sell. Rice, piece-goods, dates, coffee, sugar, ropes and woollen and leather articles are bought, and live-stock, samn (clarified butter), hides and skins, hair tents and other Bedouin products are sold. p fl In case of Koweit, which geographically is the natural port and market o ic nor ern Nejd tribes, the musabila ” system of export and import is in °^ V1I |S, f° fj! e prohibition maintained by Ibn Baud against trade with ^ a f? 1 * ^ aine reasons &gt; the great organised caravan traffic detriment of Ljl%t,Lr5rosperity WnS ° f ^ QaS ’ m ^ be6n deStr ° yed 10 ^ StatP tk^ bl l! a ls ^so carnod on with Syria and Transjordan.

(1) General. (b) Imports. The trade of Saudi Arabia consists almost entirely of imports, the necessities of life as well as luxuries having to be brought from abroad. In this, as in other aspects of local economic conditions, the absence of any official statistics makes difficult a precise appreciation of the situation, and confines a review more or less to generalities. The bulk of overseas trade, including most Government purchases, enters Saudi Arabia through the port of Jedda, although considerable quantities pass through Yanbu, the port for Medina, and Bahrein, in transit for the mainland. The value of imports through Jedda has been estimated for the two lunar years A.H. 1351 (1932-33) and AH. 1352 (193a-34) at £1,261.000 gold and £981,000 gold respectively. Other figures are not available. By the same estimate the average per annum of the principal imports over the two lunar years 1351 and 1352 were-— Value over £ gold. Cotton piece-goods .... Rice .... .... General provisions, refined sugar •••• •••• Cigarette tobacco, flour, wheat, barley, millet, lentils, cigarettes, petrol, petroleum, carpets, habadashen, motor cars, silk goods, spare parts for cars .... •••• Tobacco for water pipes, maize, loaf sugar, oils (machine and paint), spices, matches, ready-made clothing copper articles, outer tyres .... _ Other imports—Tea, coffee beans, soap, pra\ei xacs, cement and timber. 250,000 100,000 50,000 10.000 5,000 S ^°r Ug oofft hr ti n silkwH ^bSng Srials ’ll ancieh but small commerce is carried on byailmg26 / ! * boats with the Yemen (Hodeidah) and the Hadhramaut (Mukalla), bringing coffee from the former and millet, dried fish, olibanum and palm fibre, ropes, from the latter. (2) Textiles and Clothing. Most piece-goods are imported from Japan, either through the Persian Gulf ports or Jedda. Japanese greys have long been popular to the exclusion of those of the United Kingdom and Indian manufacture. In the last four years Japan has captured a large proportion of the trade in bleached and printed goods. Japanese drill competes with Belgian and French supplies. The United Kingdom and Japan supply artificial silk piece-goods, mixtures and poplin. An increase in the import of artificial silk piece-goods from Japan into Hasa, through Bahrein, has been noticeable in the last three years. Ready-made clothes, shirts woollen waistcoats and so forth are imported from Egypt and Syria, cotton vests come from Japan. There is a small trade in the Hejaz in socks and sock-suspenders (chiefly Japan) and canvas shoes (Japan). These articles, not forming part of the normal Arab dress, have, however, only a market limited to the would-be smart townsfolk. A larger trade is done in towels (Ihram) used by pilgrims to Mecca as the prescribed seamless garment, cotton sarongs and “korta” (outer clothing of cotton used by the women). United Kingdom and Japan are the chief suppliers. Small amounts of woollen goods are imported through Bahrein and Jedda of United Kingdom and Central European origin. (3) Foodstuffs. The overwhelming proportion of Saudi imports is made up of food-stuffs such as rice, sugar, flour, wheat, barley, lentils, millet and maize, beans, bran, vinegar, nuts, tea and coffee, spices, sesame, preserves and confectionery. Rice. —As seen above, rice is one of the most important imports, entering the country both though the Persian Gulf ports and Jedda. Large quantities are imported each year by the Government for distribution to the tribes in Nejd. The bulk of requirements comes from Rangoon, with India also shipping certain quantities. In 1934, 12,920 metric tons were landed at Jedda from Rangoon and 2,160 from Calcutta. Sugar. Refined sugar and, in smaller quantities, loaf sugar and lump sugar are impoited from Belgium, I nited Kingdom, Czechoslovakia (through Trieste), Ja\a and Egypt. The sugar imported into Hasa from the Persian Gulf ports seems to be of Java and United Kingdom origin. In 1934, 3.250 metric tons of sugar were landed at Jedda. F^r—Suppiied by Australia, India, Iraq (for Hasa) and France. In 1934 b,/20 metric tons of flour were landed at Jedda. Wheat^ Bailey, Lentils, Maize and Millet. —Wheat and barley are imported rom Bombay, Karachi, Egypt and Iraq; lentils from India and Egypt; maize from India, Iraq and the Sudan; millet from India and the Sudan Beans and Wheat Bran come from India and Egypt; vinegar from the United Kingdom, Italy and Egypt; nuts from Malaya, Turkey and Syria lea and Coffee—Tea, the staple drink of the Hejaz, is imported from India, Ceylon and Java while coffee, the drink of Nejd and now spreading in the Hejaz, comes from the lemen and East Africa. Yemen coffee, which is highly prized ^° 9 g 9 nn a A rabS ’ 1S „ ca U* ie d overland to Nejd. In 1934, 3,400 packages of tea and 2,200 packages of coffee (East Africa) were landed at Jedda. ^ i i • Cardamon, ginger, pepper, cloves and cinnamon, are brought from India, Java and Ceylon (through India). Sesame (gingelly seed) is imported from India. Preserves and Confectionery come very largely from the United Kingdom and m smaller quantities from Holland, Denmark and Italy. The market is naturally limited to the more sophisticated town dwellers. Jedda and Mecca are the two centres of this trade. (4) Motor Vehicles and Accessories. f ° r cars in Saudi Arabia is not negligible. Cars and trucks are 'Lt he .

The number of cars imported into the country during the last four years is approximately :— 1932 United States Italy 1933- British United States 1934— British United States Cars. 76 81 2 106 108 Commercial Vehicles. 6 6 16 2 18 2 130 132 1935— British United States Italian 3 117 2 122 287 287 (5) Machinery. Imports of machinery are practically nil. . . . Since 1930 a number of pumps (Better) have been imported for irrigation and installed principally at Riyadh and Medina (see VI (a) above). The marke , however is most limited owing to the small number of prosperous culti\ators. Electric lighting sets are imported from time to time by the few Europeans and richer natives who appreciate and can afford electricity. The e\\ sets now in the country are almost all of British manufacture. There is no municipa lighting (see VIII (/) below). 1 . . vu o n r, ; A few small grinding machines for flour are also imported with 2-h.p. i/t engines. They are of Belgian origin. (6) Cement. . . The cement imnorted in Saudi Arabia varies considerably in quantity, averaging 300 to 500 barrels a month. It is almost all and is supplied by Italy, Belgium, Egypt Czechoslovak^^ Japanese cement has been imported into the ^a UC ]\ ^ribia In 1934 quantities, part of which, doubtless, has been resold in Saudi Arabia. 600 metric tons of cement landed at Jedda. ^(7) Petroleum Products. In 1934 imports through Jedda in metric tons amounted to Benzine 2,253 Kerosene 1,994 Lubricating oil 100 Fuel oil 52 Practically all petroleum products are imported from Egypt or the Sudan The Saudi Arab Government has a contract, renewable yearly, for the supply 0 f Shell petrol. Small quantities of the Vacuum product are also sold. Russian petrol, which was imported in considerable quantities during 1931-33, has now disappeared from the market. Small quantities of lubricating oil are imported from the United Kingdom. (8) Cigurettes, Cigarette Paper, Cigarette Tobacco and Tombac. Although the smoking of tobacco is regarded as sinful in Wahhabi eyes, its import into the Hejaz is now permitted and licences are issued to tobacco sellers. Smoking in Nejd is still discountenanced, and cigarettes therefore sell for hkh prices. Cigarettes are imported from the United Kingdom, Egypt and Turkey and in small quantities from Aden. Cigarette paper is imported from Syria and Belgium and also Japan. Cigarette tobacco comes from Egypt (Turkish and Greek origin) and Aden, the latter being in especial favour in the Hejaz. The water pipe (bubble bubble or Narghile) is widely smoked by men and women in the towns of the Hejaz. The tobacco smoked in these pipes, “tombac,” is of two kinds, “ hummi ' and “kayzaruni,' which are imported from the Yemen through Aden. “Jurak, a mixture of tombac, agra wood, flowers and honey, is imported from India. Jurak is the smoke of men only. (9) Haberdashery. The market is supplied chiefly from Switzerland and the United States of America and in smaller quantities from the United Kingdom, Japan and Egypt. Gold and silver thread (see VI (d) above) for use in decorating Arab garments j is imported from Germany and India. (10) Hardware. Enamel ware, low quality aluminium ware, pewter and metal tea-pots, nails, &amp;c., come from Germany, Holland, Czechoslovakia and also in small quantities from the United Kingdom and Italy. Copper and brass ware (cooking utensils, cofiee-pots, kohl-holders and trays) are imported cheaply from (11) Soap. W r ashing and toilet soaps come from France and Syria. Some Japanese toilet soap is also found on the market. (12) Matches. No special make of matches seems to hold the market. While Russian ships used to call at Jedda a few years ago, Soviet matches were more common than otier makes Since Russian ships ceased calling no Soviet matches are on sale. Czechoslovak, Swedish and Japanese matches are all sold. (13) Radio. Receiving sets are allowed, by a regulation dated the 29th January, 19^ to be imported and installed in authorised areas which include Jedda but not nl ma a k ^ l°l SetS f therefor e very limited, but during 1935 a numbei ih l ana J)llt ch sets have been imported.

There is a large call for small souvenirs of the Holy Land during the pilgrimage season. Imitation jewellery, amberoid beads, rosaries, souvenir rings and rosaries with spy glass views of the Holy Kaaba and the tomb of the prophet cheap prayer mats aniline dyed with designs of the Holy Places, all have worth m the eyes of the pilgrim when bought in Mecca or Jedda.' Such trash is imported trom Czechoslovakia Germany and Japan (rings and rosaries), France Germany Belgium and Japan (prayer mats). ’ (15) Building Materials. There is a considerable difference between the architecture of Nejd and the ITejaz. Buildings in the former are crude, made of local materials; baked mud walls and palm beams. Buildings in the ITejaz towns are more elaborate with much woodwork. In a country with no timber, all the wood used has to be imported from abroad. Teak is brought from Singapore, deal from Central Europe. Round beams are also imported from Germany and the Sudan. Of late, many builders, who care little for quality, have taken to using the wood from motor car packing cases and petrol cases for the making of window frames and doors. Little glass is used in windows and metal frames are unknown. Most houses are built of local stone, although one or two have now been built in Jedda of reinforced concrete. (16) Paints and Varnish. The United Kingdom, Holland and Germany supply the market. In spite of the large amount of woodwork used in the Hejaz in the interior and exterior of houses it is only in recent years that the more thoughtful house-owner has begun to preserve his wood with paint. (17) Military Requirements. The Government makes occasional purchases of arms and ammunition from Europe. Orders have, in the past, been placed in the United Kingdom and Poland. Only a small proportion of the armed forces wear uniforms. (c) Methods of Business. Saudi Arabia, having as yet achieved little economic unity, lacks any one centre for trade and distribution, although all imports of bulk and importance tend to come increasingly through the Hejaz port of Jedda. The commission agent is almost unknown; most firms import direct and either sell retail or sell wholesale to small retailers. A common system with India is to have a fixed buying agent for any one article {e.g., flour) in, say, Bombay, from whom consignments are received as required and to whom the importer periodically remits specie in reimbursement. (d) Orders by the Government. Supplies for the Government, which, besides the annual import of motor ars and petrol for the pilgrimage and occasional orders for war materia , ansists almost entirely of rice, flour, and other food-stuffs, are ordere n oug i h.e European firms in Jedda or one or two of the larger native ims m e nd Bahrein. (e) Orders by Concessionnaires. The two present concessionnaires, the California Arabian Standard Oil •ompany and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, normally puichase thei squirements through their head offices in London. VIIT.— Social. dost and Standard of Living. x , . , , • Q The cost of living is dear throughout Saudi Arabia due to high „h,r, .11 iover, it varies markedly with the time &lt; y &gt; ^30 becoming dearer during the pilgrimage season Attempts have occasionally been made by the local Government to keep retail prices low In 19do the local authorities in Jedda contracted with a merchant to sell at certain hxed rates, but owing to the losses incurred the scheme failed. The standard of living is, of necessity in a country lacking any general natural wealth, low. The Bedouin live in poverty, needing little and asking for no better, while the townspeople, with exceptions in the Hejaz, are scarcely better off. The fact that the national income is confined to the pilgrimage and one or two commercial concessions tends to canalise what wealth there is through few hands, chiefly Government hands, and this may lead in a short time to an increased contrast between the wealthy few and the impo\erished mass, a contrast which hitherto has been almost non-existent as with other primitive communities. Of employment, there is sufficient in the Hejaz to keep the indigenous population occupied. From time to time the British Government find it advisable to repatriate to Africa numbers of West Africans, who, having stayed in the country after the pilgrimage as porters and navvy workmen, become too numerous for the work available and too poor to pay their passages across the Red Sea. (b) Slavery. Connected with the standard of living and employment is slavery, which is an old established institution in Arabia. The slave trade and the enslavement of pilgrims have been stopped to a great extent by the patrolling of the Red Sea and the supervision of the present Saudi Arab Government. Slave dealing in the country, however, remains legal within the Sharia law. Slavery provides domestic servants, soldiers and agricultural labourers. As an institution it can only have a detrimental effect on the psychology of the population and debase the value of the labour of free men. (c) Education. Besides Islam, which assures a certain standard of culture generally throughout the population, there is little learning as understood in the West. Schools exist in Mecca, Jedda and Medina, with an elementary curriculum. The King, in addition, has recently founded a school for princes at Riyadh. (d) Newspapers and Advertising. Owing to the lack of education the number of literates is not high even in the towns. The scope for newspapers is therefore limited. Two are published in Mecca, the Umm-al-Qura and the Saut-al-Hejaz. Egyptian Arabic news papers also circulate in the towns of the Hejaz. Advertisements appear occasionally in the local newspapers, but pictorial advertisements, depicting created beings, are not permitted for publication. (e) Trade Guilds. All workers following the same calling in any one town in the Hejaz are banded together in guilds under the authority of a sheikh, who is responsible to the Government through the municipalities. There are guilds of jewellers, brokers, tax collectors, criers to prayer, tent makers, butter sellers, butchers, tinsmiths, baibers and tailors, and of many other professions, including that of the eunuchs. Craftsmen who carry on their profession in shops pay a tax to the municipality of which a portion goes to the sheikh of the guild in question. Apprentices joining the profession also have to pay a sum to the sheikh, h return the sheikh arbitrates disputes between members of the (T uild and between them and their customers. If he fails the case is taken to the Sharia Court. ) m UlLLCipUL T w M Tl pal , aUthM : itl ? s exi ? in the Hejaz as an heritage of Turkish In Nejd, the administration of the towns is cared for by the Governors, works described below, water and electric supply arc however, unde. municinalities G^ntyn!

The towns spread or dwindle in relation to the quantZ of water the wells provide. In some Hejaz towns, however ea Mecca Jedda and Yanbu whose present size depends not on the natural resources of the neighbour hood but on the pilgrimage the question of water is urgently important. g /ubaida, the Queen of Harun-ar-Rashid, besides sinking wells along what is now the overland car route from Najaf to Medina, gave Mecca a water Supply in the 8th century a.d on which the town still depends, an aqueduct bringing water from the mountains by Jebel Arafat. This water supply, known as Ain Zubaida, also serves the places visited by pilgrims at the great pilgrimage and is therefore a religious endowment under the care of a committee, working without wage Under the present Government the Ain Zubaida Committee harc made (19d()-dl) extensive repairs to the aqueduct and springs, and have const meted wills and icseivoiis along the pilgrimage route. A. steam pump raises the water from the aqueduct into reservoirs at IVIma (a village visited during the pilgrimage). I he Am Zubaida Committee have also (1933-34) reopened the Turkish aqueduct, which, before the Saudi-Hejaz war, brought water from Waziriya. 11 miles awmy in the foothills, to Jedda. This supply is plentiful except at certain times of the year and cheap, as no charge is made save for distribution. It is, however, neither clean nor sufficient for all the needs of the population and pilgrims. There are also numerous underground rain-water catch pits around Jedda, which are capable of storing a considerable quantity of water. The real water supply of Jedda, as of Yanbu, depends on the condensers erected by the Government to condense sea water. Under the Hashimite regime there was one old condenser working in Jedda. From 1926 to 1929 two larger condensers were bought from the United Kingdom (Mirrlees Watson, Glasgow), and a third (100 tons per twenty-four hours), of the same manufacture, was installed at Yanbu. The two condensers at Jedda are capable of producing 300 tons of water a day, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the town under all circumstances. The retail cost is relatively high. The Government has recently had in mind the erection of a condenser at Jizan. There is no municipal electricity in Saudi Arabia. The Associated British Manufacturers (Limited) sent an engineer in 1926 to survey Jedda for this purpose, but nothing has since been done by the local authorities. The Banque Misr of Cairo are stated to be at present interested in the provision of Mecca with a municipal supply. The mosques at Mecca and Medina are lighted by their own plants donated by pious Moslems. In Mecca some attempt has been made to create a small public garden, to which, it was announced in 1935, the public would be admitted on charge. The King imported plants and flowers for his Mecca garden in 1928 from the Sudan, Cyprus and India. Few other attempts are made to embellish the towns even in the Hejaz. (g) Pilgrimage and Religious Endowments. The pilgrimage to Mecca is prescribed as one of the five obligations of Islam; the pilgrimage to Medina is optional. While the lesser pilgrimage to Mecca, which has a certain virtue, can be made at any season of the year, the greater pilgrimage can onlv be completed by standing on the plain ot Aia a , outside Mecca, on the 9th day of DhuT Hijja. Although the whole ceremony therefore occupies but four or five days in each year, many pilgrims arme as much as five months before this date and many do not leave unti wo mon s after it. The pilgrimage season thus occupies a considerable portion ot tne year, and so enables almost the whole native population of the Hejaz to live in entirety bj J53r,“ 1™ Pilgrimage Da, (ft, .ft J„SS,“k “ta m the commercial summary of this leport. i ne imp i i \ for the pilgrim market (prayer rugs amulets and 'f^^dan ^ tUrd i^ aI require to receive their stocks before the beginning . ‘ T?o niac i an a month month preceding DhuT Hijja—about ninety days ; o nhdit. and the of rigorous fasting by day, much entertammen is &lt; °largest sales of confectionery and sweetmeats, ornamental crockery and glassware take place just before or during Ramadan.

It may, therefore, serve some purpose if British exporters aie made awaie of these dates ^ of the Moslem year : the 1st Ramadan, which is the latest date by which stocks should reach Jedda; the period, from a few weeks before Ramadan until a few weeks after Arafat day, when business is most brisk and local trade reaches its high water mark. Large sums of money are spent by the pilgrims during their sojourn in the Hejaz, and the end of the pilgrim season finds local merchants more ready than at other times of the year to pay off their debts to suppliers. The number of overseas pilgrims in recent years amount to :— — 1926. 1927. 1928. 1929. 1930. 1931. 1932. 19a3. 1934. 1935. 1936.

Awqaf), either in the form of hostels built and maintained for the benefit of pilgrims or the poor of the country, or the annual receipt of money from foundations in other Islamic countries, endowed by the pious for the benefit of the Haramayn (the two sanctuaries of Mecca and Medina), or, again, for the poor of these towns. (h) Prisons, lunatic asylums and hospitals. 1 here are prisons in Jedda, Mecca, Medina and other towns. There are no arrangements for feeding persons in prison, save that a small ration of water is supplied by the Government. No special provision is made for lunatics in Saudi Arabia. They are put in prison, but not cared for. I he Saudi Arab Government evinces great interest in public health arrangements, on which much depends during the pilgrimage, but they lack efficient personnel and equipment. There are Government hospitals in Mecca, Jedda and Medina, and with the help of foreign Moslems considerable extensions and lebuildmg ha\e been done to the latter two in the last two years. The Bi itish (Government of India) and other foreign Governments maintain dispensaries in Jedda and or Mecca which are busily attended not only by pilgrims but by all classes of the local population.

Jedda, August 14, 1936. reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch Ngi. 95JE. of the 29th March last, I have the honour to report certain further developments in the currency situation in Saudi Arabia. 2. Five hundred thousand new rivals arrived early in May and some appeared in circulation almost immediately. The Government have, however, shown great caution in introducing the new currency, and to this caution, according to an official of the Jedda branch of the Dutch banking concern, the Nederlandsche Handels Maatschappij, may be attributed the present comparative stability of the riyal, both in relation to the gold pound and to the Egyptian paper pound. It is also stated that the Government are resolved to maintain the present rate of 20 rivals to the gold pound, but whether this wi be possible when the pilgrim season creates an added demand tor local currency may well be conjectured. . . , 3 ' Up to date only two new half and no new quarter riyal pieces have passed through the hands of the Legation accounting officer, although according to a notice which appeared m the newspaper Saut-al-Hejaz on the 23rd June, the old half and quarter pieces ceased to be legal tende ^‘ ° n 1 V date, but could be exchanged against gold, at standard rate, if presente c Ministry of Finance within two months. The reason given foi this o — the risk of confusion between the old half riyals and the new nyals, as the latter are only a little larger than the former. attemnt to 4. The authorities seem to have been fairly successful m their attempt to withdraw the old currency, as two large shipments to London have bee . d recently through Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co.

Extract from the Annual Report for 1935. IV.— Financial, Economic and Commercial Affairs. Finance and Currency. 139. In the continued absence of budgetary or other reliable information, it is again impossible to give any precise account of the financial situation in 1935. It is certain that the Saudi Treasury lived as usual from hand to mouth, resorting to all the shifts described in previous reports. The King’s demands for remittances of gold to Riyadh were stated to be heavy early in the year. A further and very drastic cut Tvas applied to all official salaries in June. On the whole, however, money for current expenditure seemed to be easier, thanks, no doubt, to the cessation of the strain imposed by the Saudi-Yemen war of 1934 and to the marked increase in the pilgrimage, which brought grist to the mill both directly and probably indirectly as w T ell owing to its favourable effect on the import trade and, consequently, on the revenue from customs. The camel deal with the Italians also brought in some money, though not as much as if political considerations had not deterred the Government from exporting camels to Eritrea on a large scale. 140. The important local firm of Haji Abdullah Alireza and Co. obliged the Government on occasion, e.g., in connexion with the purchases of rupees mentioned below. Other firms may have done the same, and the Banque Misr probably again advanced money on the security of the quarantine dues to be collected by their associated shipping company on behalf of the Saudi Govern ment from Egyptian pilgrims. Another favourite device for anticipating future revenue by issuing drafts on customs to local firms to whom the Government owe money continued to be used. It is believed, however, that during 1935 such drafts were issued only to the more important importing firms and that they were made non-transferable. 141. The customs duty on various articles, of which the most important were petrol, artificial silk, tobacco and perfume, was reduced in May. It is interesting to note as an essay in sanitary policy that carbolic acid was exempted altogether. The only new taxes known to have been imposed were import duties and licence fees on wireless sets (see paragraph 200), which, though heavy in themsehes, cannot be expected to produce much revenue in the near future. 142. No great importance can be attached to schemes to collect voluntary subscriptions for public purposes. Mention may, however, be made of the efioits nf tLa AvnK AAmnantippi 1 Societv (see paragraph 189) and of a piastre scheme2 rapid fall and rates remained fairly steady during the remainder of the year. They were approximately 1/^ at the end of September and 18 at the end of December. 146. The reasons for these fluctuations are hard to analyse. The rise mar have been due partly to hoarding in the uncertain world conditions of the summer partly to an expansion in the legitimate demand for silver currency, e.g., f or ^ purposes of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. In any case there seemed to be a shortage of rivals, definite enough to perturb the Government, who decided to increase the circulation. They made enquiries in various quarters in July, August, asking the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate to advance 1 million riyi to be minted by the syndicate and addressing themselves also to the Royal Mint in England, which was asked to quote prices. No business was done in these quarters. It was not until early 1936 that the Legation learnt that an order had been placed in Birmingham, through the intermediary of the Banque Misr and the National Bank of Egypt, for 1 million riyals. These, it is said, will be similar in everything except the superscription to the Indian rupee and the present riyals may be withdrawn. This has not been confirmed up to the time of writing, but the report is of great interest in view of the other most remarkable feature, now to be described, of the currency situation in 1935. 147. During the period May to December the Saudi Government imported from India through Jedda about 2 million rupees intended principally for use in Nejcl. The idea was to substitute this currency, which has the advantage of having a fixed relation to sterling, for the Maria Theresa dollar. The experiment seems to have had a considerable success. There is probably no ground for the belief entertained in some quarters late in the year that the rupee had been made the official currency of eastern Saudi Arabia, but when the Legation party passed through Riyadh in November the bulk of the silver used there consisted of rupees. The Maria Theresa dollar, though still in use, appeared to be in process of being ousted. The Saudi riyal was very unpopular, as it has always been outside the Hejaz. Economic Conditions and Development. General Economic Conditions. 148. There is no known change to report in connexion with economic conditions generally during the year. There were slight signs perhaps of slowly returning prosperity in Jedda and Mecca. Poverty in Medina attracted attention for tne reason given in paragraph 127 above. Oppressive taxation was said to oe ci eating distress and discontent in. Hasa, where the increase in customs duty enected m 1933 has been keenly felt. The rains in the winter of 1934-35 were, nowever, plentiful and again promised well for 1935-36. This meant good grazing in most northern areas, throughout the year. The price of camels seems to have improved somewhat, thanks partly perhaps to the L demand for animals ° ° r indirectl y to Eritrea (see paragraphs 81 ff.). * fn xt lhe mternatlonal crisis threatened twice at least to affect food prices !. n once m t* 16 summer when the temptation to export live-stock. u ’ 0 I assawa seemed likely to deplete the market, and more seriously b • e P em)e L ^| ien il nervous eagerness to hoard supplies caused a great increase 'ru/ 11 n 68 r ^. de . drs Jr occasion little was actually exported, owing to tlie difficulty of obtaining Government permission and partly to the unfortunate experience of the exporters of the consignment mentioned in oaragraph 80. 0a nrnfif^riL 000 ^ 1011 ‘Li g ove , rnment took drastic action in October to prevent .p,’ 11 e( tie iormation of committees in various towns to colic 0 'Oiispoiiciici* e r , f e, ;,;h t 'r 1 ; 1 01 d* 8 control was apparently abandoned j 11 be Sied ri^orf l est r by - raerchant s, but they were warned that it wouM lf d r r 1C / S , again went lI P- The P ress announced on* that orices thrrmeffin f°Q / ood 'St u ffs had been restored to normal, and claim 6 £ ^audi Arabia were now more favourable than abroad.

It is thought that there may be more manageable oil at a lower depth. Meanwhile it is intended to start sinking a second well not far from the first. The position at the eno of the year was that tne prospects were promising, but that oil was still not being produced in commercial quantities. I he company had had some trouble during the year with the Saudi Director of finance, &amp;c., in Hasa, and some little labour trouble. The latter does not seem to have been serious, and the former was settled by the appointment of a separate official from the Hejaz to deal with their affairs. 151. Less is known of the other activities of the California Arabian Standard Oil ( ompany. They would appear to have restricted somewhat their general surveying operations during the latter part of the year. On the other hand, they were reported early in May to be negotiating for rights in a further area to the west of their original concession. It was at first suggested that they wished to secure this in substitution for part of the original area, but it seems more probable that they were acting under the option mentioned in paragraph 50 of the report for 1934, which referred not only to the Koweit neutral zone, but in very general terms to an area west of that definitely conceded in 1933. Some further light was thrown on the extent of the original area by a document which came confidentially to the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government in 1935, and which purported to be the full text of the 1933 concession. There is no reason to doubt its authenticity, although, as it does not contain the famous option clause, it must be assumed that there was at least one supplementary agreement. 152. The main agreement just referred to defined the conceded area as consisting of “ all of eastern Saudi Arabia from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters) westward to the westerly edge of the bahana and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia,” subject to a definition of how the lines bounding the concession on the west should be drawn from the edge of the Dahana to the northern and southern frontiers. The company have, therefore, a very material interest in the result of the controversy between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government regarding Ibn Saud’s eastern frontiers. Should he make good his claim to the Jebel Nakhsh (see paragraph 57) they might hope to find oil in that district. Lnder the offers already made by His Majesty’s Government they would have rights in the strip of country adjoining the southern extremity of the Gulf of Bahrein on the west, where there is reason to think that oil may be discovered. 153. Little was heard in 1935 about oil prospects in the west of Saudi Arabia, except from Mr. Ydlibi, who, always an optimist, professed in April to have as good as got a concession for the whole of the western coastal area fiom south of Aqaba to the Yemen border, including the Farsan Islands. 154. The position in regard to a possible oil concession m the Ivoweit neutral zone is described in paragraph 50 above. As for other areas marginal to Ibn Saud’s eastern dominions, reference need only be made m this report to the indirect interest of Saudi Arabia in the concession granted b\ the Sheikn o Qatar on the 17th May, 1935, to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), and to the interest manifested by various persons and companies during tie year m the oil potentialities in the Trucial sheikhdoms and Muscat and ie position at the end of the year was that interests ultimately identical with those participating in the Iraq Petroleum Company had obtained prospecting options from the rulers of Ras-al-Khaimah, Dibai and bharjah, an ^ e ^ e , f getting a similar option from the ruler of Abu Dhaoi. huprpsts in these options should be transferred to a new concern orme y i ^ question under the name of Petroleum Concessions (Limited)^ Thm company had in view the possibility of acquiring rights m a very extensive area from the Koweit neutral zone to Muscat and Oman, both me usive eit neutral zone to iviusucil , Q 0 , ir ]; A r ohi ;1 155.

The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), of which some account was given in paragraph 141 of the report for 1934, made considerable progress during 1935, thanks to the unbounded energy of its creator, Mr. Twitched. By the end of the year a complete mining camp had been brought into existence at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab or Cot of Gold, where there are numerous remains of old workings. The success of this mine seemed to be fairly assured, and it provided employment for most of the mixed collection of about twenty-five Americans and Europeans of various nationalities whom Mr. Twitchell has recruited, as well as for about 700 local labourers. The results obtained in other areas in 1935 were less definite, but at the end of December Mr. Twitchell had made preparations to send well-equipped prospecting parties to the districts round Yanbu and Wejh, and to two others further inland. He has shown also a revival of interest in the Taif area, which was explored under his auspices in 1931-32 with apparently negative results. 157. The Mahd-adh-Dhahab was thought, in November, to lie approximately at the intersection of parallel 23 c 30' and meridian 41 E. Its exact position is of some importance, as it was named as a marginal point in the definition of the area in which the syndicate obtained prospecting rights at the end of 1934. Some difficulty appears to have arisen between Mr. Twitchell and the Government as to whether one at least of the inland areas which he wished to prospect lies inside or outside the boundary thus defined.. 158. Another adverse factor which may give trouble is the hostility which the concession has aroused in certain quarters and which is partly inspired by real or alleged religious feeling over the “ sale ” of a great part of the Holy Land by Ibn Saud to “ the British.” The King’s brothers were said early in the year to be greatly annoyed by his having granted the concession. The fanatic Governor of Medina has shown himself sticky. There has been a campaign against the concession in India. The King may be expected to stand firm, but, if the enemies of the concession, who are not all animated by religious sentiment, succeeded in stirring up trioal animosity, the operations of the syndicate miMit well be hampered. 159. The syndicate opened an office in Jedda in October and started work in December on a large compound about a mile outside the town. A pier is to be built on the coast opposite this compound. Work was well advanced at the end of the year on a direct road from Jedda to the mine, which is at present difficult of access. The new road, which should be about 230 miles long, is not elaborately Planned, but it is hoped to get easy gradients to facilitate transport. The most difficult part has still to be made. Other Projects. IbO. \ arious other projects were canvassed during the year. Some of the smaller are not worth mentioning. Most of the larger are not new T , but may derive an impetus from the energy of Talaat Pasha Harb and the Banque Misr g.oup. xUxaat I asha was credited with interest in so many enterprises at the beginning of 1936 that it is hard to know what he has in view. Among the projects in which he seemed to be most immediately interested were schemes for the nrovision of fdentripit.v nnr! q i _• the piovision of electricity and a house-water supply in Mecca and an air service He had also shown interest in the possibility of between Jedda and Medina making moaern roads to Mecca and Medina, but expense was a deterrent. He does not seem to be interested in the scheme for a Jedda-Mecca railway, of which there was further talk during the year. Mr. Ydlibi spoke hopefully in April o getting this concession, and a French group were also thought to be after it. Ihere was also talk of a new condenser at Jizan, for which 1 Messrs. Gellatly, Han key and^ Co. quoted a price in the autumn. 161. ( rhan development is promised in Jedda and Mecca, new boulevards .or the former a new park for the latter.

As regards motor transport, the only important addition to be made to paragraphs 144 and 145 of the report for 1934 is that in May the Government promulgated a deciee enacting the creation of a single company to take the place of the four existing companies working under Government auspices and the much largei number ot private transport concerns. The new company was to be divided into two sections corresponding respectively with the four* Government companies and the fomiei private concerns. It was to take over the rolling-stock of the various private firms at a valuation in return for shares in the combine Many details of the scheme were obscure. Later in the year the new arrange ment did not seem to be working very happily, but a better judgment of it can be formed when it has stood the test of the 1936 pilgrimage season. 164. The load system is still most primitive. It cannot be too often repeated that what is called a road in Saudi Arabia is merely a practicable track over which cars bump or bowl according to the character of the natural surface. Saudi road-making consists in making such tracks a little more practicable. It was intended after the 1935 pilgrimage to improve the worst part in Saudi territory of the track between Nejef and Medina (see paragraph 7), but it is not known whether this has been done. Mention was made in the local press of other minor projects to improve existing roads and strike out one or two new ones. A report from Transjordan for May mentioned road-making activity in the north of Saudi Arabia. A passing reference may be made in this connexion to an experimental journey by cars made by certain merchants of Damascus to the Hejaz just after the 1935 pilgrimage to explore the possibility of regular motor services. The general conclusion would appear to have been that the country is too difficult and the time taken too long for the idea to be feasible. 165. Foreign enterprise has done a little to stimulate interest in road making of a more modern type. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s road, mentioned in paragraph 159, will probably mark an advance in this direction, although it is not ambitiously planned. The interest of Talaat Pasha Harb in the subject has been adverted to in paragraph 160. but, as there stated, expense is likely to be a great deterrent. It is difficult to form estimates, but it seems probable that it would cost not less than £1,000 a mile to make asphalted roads to Mecca and Medina, and it might well cost a good deal more. Talaat Pasha does not seem to have been encouraged by the results of one small experinient just outside Jedda, where he had a few hundred yards of asphalted road laid during the year under review. 166. There is no port work to record, except the construction by the California Arabian Standard Oil Co. of a small pier for their own use at Akhbar (Khobar) on the coast near their oil well at Dhahran, and the intended construction of a pier north of Jedda by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (paragraph 159). The improvements at Jedda mentioned in paragraph 161 are on land only. 167. There has been little change since 1934 in the communications of the Hejaz by sea.

The Arabian Steam Navigation Company mentioned in paragraph Uq of the report for 1934 showed no signs of extended activity. The compan ! second ship, An-Nasr, never returned, but the other vessel, Al Fath mar) 8 occasional trips to Jizan with military supplies and personnel and did a certa’ 6 amount of coastwise trade as well. The smaller ships of the Misr Navio-at] 111 Company (see paragraph 150 of the report for 1934) called fairly frequently °t Jedda during the year. ' • a 169. The increase in the numbers of pilgrims was reflected somewhat in the shipping. The Mogul Line ran a new ship specially designed for pilgrim traffic the steamship Islami, and she made a number of voyages during the year providing a marked improvement in accommodation for all classes of nilo-n^’ The Zemzem, of the Misr Navigation Company, mentioned in paragraph 150 in last year’s report, was joined for the pilgrimage season by the steamship Kawsar specially built for the transport of emigrants from Europe to South America’ These two ships made four voyages in all from Suez to Jedda. i uzo* uuu i eieg rapns. LG. Ihe organisation of inland postal services appears to make slow progress, but little information on the subject is available. As regards external services, arrangements were made between the postal departments of the Saudi Government and of the Government of India at the end of 1934 for a daily mail service between Bahrein, on the one hand, and Hofuf and Qatif on the other, to replace a previous weekly service. This arrangement was to come into force on the 2.9th February, 1935. In June the Saudi Government approached His Majesty s Government regarding a proposed postal service between Jizan and Kainaran apparently overlooking the fact that they had raised the same question m 1931 and received a tayourable reply (see report for 1931, paragraph 40). The m„ I l e ' Ve l. I B eqUe j t was a 8' aln acceded to in principle, and the practical arrange ments prepared by the postal department of the Government of India were H.w e rPmt by K he , Legatl0n t0 , the 1 Saudi Government on the 31st October.

I his led to complaints from other merchants, and on one occasion a protest regarding a consignment of rice caused a somewhat wider distribution of Government favours to soothe the malcontents. The Government imported no large quantities of arms, but see paragraph 185 below as regards samples. 1/7. Sharqieh (Limited) continued to have the lion’s share of the importa tion oi motor vehicles, under the Ford monopoly described in paragraph 156 of the report for 19:34, but Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. imported in 1935 fifteen Cheviolets and three Buicks. Sharqieh (Limited) have had to adapt their arrangements with the Government to some extent to the new situation caused bv the creation of the transport monopoly described in paragraph 163 above. There was some discussion in the summer about a possible contract for supplying the petrol requirements of this monopoly, but nothing definite was arranged. The Shell Company supplies the bulk of the Government requirements, and a proposal to give the contract for supplying the monopoly to the producers of an American brand, Citex, apparently fell through owing to’the expense of insuring against war risks. 178. A small but growing trade in wireless sets has sprung up as a result of the legislation to be described in paragraph 200 below. Cheap sets of American and Dutch manufacture, imported direct or through Egypt, are mostly in demand. 179. The export trade of Jedda continues to be negligible. That of Yanbu was increased in 1935 by the export of 1.000 camels at the high price of £15 gold or more to Eritrea in the circumstances described in paragraph 82 above. 180. Information regarding outlying areas is even more meagre. The Italian demand seems to have given some stimulus to the export of camels overland to Syria. The briskness of the trade across the Transjordan frontier has been noted in paragraph 21. Native butter, dates, hair-tents and live-stock would appear to be the chief exports, while silk goods, cotton goods and cereals are imported from Transjordan. An Amman estimate puts the total of such imports for the year 1934-35 at £P. 10,000. Prosperity in Nejd, following on good rains, is said to have been reflected in increased activity in the bazaars of Eiyadh. Those of Hofuf also presented a busy appearance, when visited on a market day by Sir Andrew Ryan and Captain de Gaury.EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. 3 3 n q ^ v- L; c) April Section 4. [E 2106/1041/25] Sir A. Ryan to Mr. Eden.—{Received A mil 20) (No. 95E.) Slr ’ „tt .... Jedda, March 29, 1936. aware that the currency situation in this country has undergone many vicissitudes since Ibn Sand conquered the Hejaz. These have been particularly marked since early in 1931, owing to the breakdown in practical application of the regulations enclosed m Mr. Bird’s despatch No. 12 of the 20th January, 1928, anti the further confusion entailed by the suspension of the gold standard in Great Bi itain in the autumn of that year. The English gold pound has remained throughout the main basis of the Saudi currency system, but the market value of the Saudi silver riyal was, in and after 1931, far below the official parity of 10 riyals to the gold pound, established by the regulations of 1928. 2. It may be well to recall very briefly the genesis of the system established by the regulations of 1928. The main elements in the pre-war Turkish currency were the Turkish gold pound, similar in fineness to, but about -9 per cent, of the weight, of the English sovereign; and the famous silver coin called the mejidie which, though it had depreciated somewhat, stood for many years in a fixed relation to gold. The Turkish gold pound was divided theoretically into 100 gold piastres, although the gold piastre did not exist as a coin. It ensued from this that the English gold pound was worth 110 gold piastres. The mejidie and its sub-divisions, which included a current silver piastre, had various values according to the uses to which it was put, but for official purposes it was reckoned at about 102 piastres to the Turkish gold pound and about 112 piastres to the English gold pound. The market rate was lower. I quote these figures from memory, but they are sufficiently accurate for my present purpose. 3. The Saudi regulations of 1928 substituted for the mejidie and its sub divisions Saudi silver riyals of exactly the same size, weight and silver content and established the legal parity, already mentioned, of 10 riyals to the English gold pound, which had more or less superseded the Turkish gold pound. By an adaptation of the old Turkish rates for gold, they provided that the English gold pound and the riyal, respectively, should be divided into 110 and 11 theoretical piastres called “miri,” which corresponded to the Turkish ‘‘gold piastres,” and into 220 and 22 current piastres, which came to be known as Saudi. 4. From 1931 to 1934 the Saudi riyal fluctuated greatly, the general tendency being in the direction of depreciation, subject to seasonal variations in the opposite sense. Last year, however, the riyal, while still well below its legal value in terms of gold, showed a tendency to appreciate. There appeared to be a shortage of silver currency, and early in the autumn the Saudi Government cast about for means of remedying the situation. They had already begun to import large quantities of Indian rupees, mainly for use in Nejd, where the Saudi jiy a l had never been popular and had never ousted the Maria Theresa dollar. Thev also contemplated a new issue of silver riyals, a project which has forced the subject of correspondence ending with my Chancery s letter to the Eastern Department of the 1st February last. I may add that after that letter was written, I had reason to suppose that the new riyals were to be simi ai, oxcep for the Saudi superscription, to the Indian rupee; that the quan i v or o ie &gt; including presumably silver sub-divisions, was 1 million riyals an a Parity of the new riyal would be fixed at 20 riyals to the goM poundL One informant suggested to me that the existing riyals would e wi that the new issue would suffice for all requirements, a wuc difficult to believe unless the rupees from India are used to eke out the official currency not only in Nejd but in the Hejaz , . , T h heard nothin^ , 5. Pending the issue of the new riyals, of wh f 1C \ ion the nub ? further, the Saudi Ministry of Finance has sprung a f / n ^ ® U ^ r ^LsVtion Its hy publishing on the 23rd March a notice, which [681 u—4]main effects appear to be to establish a new at the -te °f 20 to the^old pound ^the p^rpos^^ ^ Saudi^piastres and the other elements in currency by gating the gold h7f U ! Saudf piastre P1 Paragraph^provides that payments to the Governmen MtLrto feed^ mTri piastres shall be payable in Sand, pmstres to double the number of miri piastres shown in the tariffs, &amp;e. Thus the English gold pound remains 'the basis of currency as before but the existing riyal is officially devalued to a rate approximating to that to which it had fallen, though with variations, in the market. , 6 I orefer to postpone further comment on the new arrangements until I know more of their practical application. They produced some emotion in the markets of Jedda and Mecca for a day or two, but this seems to have died down, on its being discovered that market transactions m riyals are not necessarily effected though thev may be influenced by the Government arrangements. The first effect in the local money markets was a marked fall in the value of the riyal. The permanent effect is difficult to estimate. It is possible that the whole thing is a prelude to the issue of the new riyals, but I confess my inability to see at present what the modus overandi is likely to be, it this should be the case. 1 7.

CONFIDENTIAL. *'&gt; V A vJ J Section 3. [E 7475/1012/25] AIt. (cilvert to Siv Samuel Hoove.—(Received December 23.) (No. 344. Confidential.) ^ ir &gt; Jedda, 'November 30, 1935. IN my despatch No. 370 of the 11th December, 1934. I had the honour to submit a brief review of the general financial and economic situation in Saudi Arabia. I now propose, after an interval of almost twelve months, to attempt a similar appreciation, necessarily as brief and perhaps as fragmentary as in previous years, in view of the absence of reliable statistics and the lack of authoritative sources of information. 2. Whilst during the previous twelve months Saudi finances were heavily engaged in meeting and satisfying the demands of the Saudi-Yemen War and its settlement, the period under review may be held to have witnessed the liquida tion of the immediate legacies of the conflict and a renewal of the activities of the Minister of Finance, now less preoccupied with the duties of his second office of Deputy Minister of Defence, to find fresh sources of revenue to repair the seriously deplenished financial resources of the State. 3. Some relief was afforded early in the year by a further increase in the number of foreign pilgrims performing the Hajj in 1935. Not only did this figure increase from 25,291 in 1934 to 33,898, but an exceptional number of distinguished personages and well-to-do pilgrims visited the Hejaz this year,, a matter of some point when the general level of wealth amongst incoming pilgrims has fallen so markedly in these lean years. The beneficent effects of the increase brought comfort to all classes in the Hejaz, but complaints were not wanting that the Government had appropriated to themselves the lion’s share of the pilgrimage harvest, and distress, even amongst merchants, motor-car proprietors and pilgrim guides, all of whom might have been expected to have benefited most by a larger pilgrimage, was only partially alleviated. Certain foreign companies in Jedda, however, had a more satisfactory year, upon completing their accounts after the Hajj, both Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) and Messrs. Sharqieh (Limited) being able to record some improvement, the latter having achieved a reasonably good profit, albeit, according to Mr. Philby, a ‘ ‘ paper ’' one. . . 4. Customs receipts form the other main item of Saudi revenue, and during the twelve months under review these, although no official figures are available, may be expected to have risen in sympathy with the increase in the numbeis of pilgrims. Other sources of revenue are of subordinate importance; concessions have not yet commenced to yield steady revenue, for operations by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company for the production of oil in Hasa, t oug promising, have not yet been completely successful, and gold-mining opera ions, by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, upon which I have reported separately, have not yet reached the production stage, though here also there are believed to be grounds for optimism. As statistics of any description are, m e a sence of official figures, of some interest, I give—for what they are worth—estimates given in the Egyptian newspaper the Muqattam and reproduce !? ,, Moderno of May 1935, of the revenues of the Hejaz for this year (piesuma 1. a period ending after the 1935 pilgrimage) : From pilgrimage ... From customs receipts From other sources Total £ Gold. 300,000 200,000 100.000 600.0002 5. General trading conditions may be said to have shown some improves during the period under review. Chiefly owing to the larger pilgrimage th have been increased clearances through customs and a somewhat ^better tone 6 ’ 6 the market. This, unfortunately, does not mean that conditions can be describe as satisfactory, but the tendency is encouraging. Protests were again evoked during the year by the practice of the Government of importing ^oods particularly rice, through one importing firm, Messrs. Haji Abdullah* Ahreza and Co., to the detriment of others, with the result that some small redistribution of favours was effected to soothe the malcontents. The system adopted by the Saudi Arab Government of settling their local indebtedness by allowing rebates of customs dues on goods imported was maintained through the year, although in its early months the Government appeared disposed to abandon it/ Adverse comment, and perhaps a realisation of the convenience of the system to the authorities themselves, led to a continuance of this practice. From one source it is gathered that the total number of packages to enter through the port of Jedda during the past twelve months was 620.000, of which some 120.000 were for the Saudi Arab Government or foreign diplomatic missions, and hence duty free. 6. Exports continued to be negligible (thev were estimated in March last for the previous twelve months, at about £8,000 gold), but may be expected during recent days to have received a fillip from the reported purchase of camels from this country by the Italians for purposes connected with the war in Abyssinia, a subject on which separate reports have been submitted. About 1.000 camels are said to have been shipped from Yanbu, though confirmation is still awaited, and the price paid is generally believed to be in the neighbourhood of £15 gold per camel. 7. The \isible adverse balance of trade is therefore heavy and has been estimated locally by a confidential, but well-informed, source as about £1,261,000 gold for the year 1351 A.H. and £981,000 gold for 1352 A H. ^ r. S con ? m - v has again been rigidly practised, except perhaps in certain items oi Royal expenditure, and once more at the expense of Government officials, whose salaries, when paid, were invariably in arrear, whilst in the early summer steps were taken to effect an all-round salary reduction of 25 per cent., two-thirds o the now reduced salary to be paid in cash and one-third in kind, the cash payment to be reckoned in gold at a rate highly unfavourable to the official. . Apart Horn the system of customs drafts, described above, the Saudi oyeinment are believed to have been able to meet current liabilities. One signal instance, either of a recognition of the advantages to be derived from a settlement ( e v S i 01 r a ( esire 1 to please, may be recorded when, in May 1935, they repaid ic w o e o one small debt due to His Majesty’s Government and 10 per cent, o a larger one due to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. . ittle or no additional taxation has been imposed during the past twelve mon s, except in the case of certain minor matters, such as the imposition of ax ^ on wireless receiving sets, permission to import and .e vhich, restricted to certain towns of the Hejaz, was one of the notable concessions to Western influences of the year.

It is said that Bin Sa'ud intends to watch the reactions in Hajd to the reforms which he is intoducing in the Hasa Province before attempting to do anything . elsewhere.227. LACK OF UGI^Y III SAUDI ARABIA . 1 On 11th a well-known Kuwaiti tribesman who had gone to Riath as leader of a party who took a present of 12 mares to Bin Saud 4-i months ago, returned. In an interview with the writer he said that the King had accepted the mares willingly and had given him an order on Ibn Jiluwi, to receive Rs.24C0/- from the Hassa Treasury. The latter had kept him waiting for his money for three months, always on the excuse that there was no money in the Treasury. After the death of the Amir, the Kuwaiti approached the new incumbent, Baud al Jiluwi. The latter sent for ]2ohamed al Tawil and up-braided him sharply for not settling the King’s debts and so bringing shame on the good name of the Al Saud. Al Tawil again excused himself, saying that the Treasury was quite °mpty, whereupon Amir Saud ordered the Kuwaiti to go to Jubail and get his money, and gave him letters to the G-overnor and Customs Officer there to pay up on their peril. The Kuwaiti went to Jubail and after three days got his money. It was extorted from merchants there and not found from the Treasury, which, as at Hoffuf, was empty. Delighted, the Kuwaiti returned to his home full of praise for Saud bin Abdulla al Jiluwi. He had been 4 months trying to get his money in Hoffuf, and said that he was most lucky for several hundred were still there when he left, who all had money owing them by the Saudi administration ior fax longer periods than himself.EASTERN (Arabia).

WITH reference to my despatch N o. 281 o f the 9th October, concerning the activities of the Banqne Misr in this country, and more especially their interest in road making, I have the honour to report that the kilometre of asphalt road which it was expected the Banque Misr engineers would lay down as a sample, dwindled in fact to a short stretch of some hundred yards. This was very quickly completed and the Greek engineer left again for Egypt some ten days later. Nothing more having been heard of the Egyptian engineer, it is probable that he also has returned home. 2. The hundred yards of road lies outside the Medina gate of Jedda on ground which, owing to its firmness, one might mistrust as a reliable test for a road which, if and when constructed, will have to pass on its way to Mecca, over hills, wadi beds and shifting sands. No special preparation, as far as could be seen, was given to the foundation, the land meiely being levelled and the asphalt laid. As for cost, it is now said that the estimate for laying the whole Mecca—Jedda road is less than the &lt;£45,000 quoted in my despatch under reference, but the exact figure is not know n. 3 Talaat Pasha Harb is reported to intend visiting the Hejaz after Ramadan, which ends with the end of December, so the roadway project may then be re-examined and a decision taken whether or not to proceed with the construction of the Mecca road. , 0 . 4 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary of State tor Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade, his Excellency the Vicerov of India and to his Excellency the High Commissioner, Cairo.

THE interest evinced in the Hejaz by the Banque Misr, particularly in regard to the promotion and development of Egyptian interests in the annual pilgrimage, have been the subject of report by the Legation from time to time. The relations established with the Saudi authorities by Talaat Harb Pasha on his visits to this country in the latter end of both 1933 and 1934 have been maintained, and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman in spending some time recently in Egypt, on his way to Syria and possibly Turkey, recorded in Jedda reports for August and September, paragraphs 253 and 286 respectively, is with good reason believed to have been animated by a desire to cultivate those relations still further. 2. That the Minister of Finance has been to some extent successful would appear from the arrival at Jedda on the 1st October by one of the small vessels of the Societe Misr de Navigation maritime, now plying in the Red Sea, of a consignment of fifty-four barrels of Shell asphalt for the purpose of laying down an experimental stretch of road on the main Jedda-Mecca highway. A Greek engineer and an Egyptian, said to represent Talaat Pasha Harb, arrived by the same ship, and several days earlier, by a Khedivial Mail vessel, a mixing machine for use in road construction was also landed here on behalf of the Banque Misr 3. The two representatives of the Egyptian concern have, since their arrival, lost no time in getting to work, and operations have already commenced outside the Medina Gate of Jedda. It is credibly stated that a kilometre of asphalted road will be laid down at the expense of Banque Misr, except for the labour which is being supplied by the Saudi authorities. I am confidentially informed by the manager of Messrs.^ Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) that it 's estimated that the cost of laying down the whole Mecca-Jedda road under asphalt would be in the neighbourhood of £45,000, or £1,000 a nule.^ . r. ,°. ur ,^. • ’ • . i representative of the Shell Company here is much m eres e m P 1 iff or t informed me that Signor Odallo, the soj-disont Italian merchant made an effort to induce the Greek engineer to use Italian asphalt instead of the Shell product, ''‘VTrS.g c.p». of .hi.

An eve witness of the man’s meeting with the Xing at al Khafs, told me on 20th February that at first the King treated him in proper 'cold' fashion, but later forgave him publicly for the part he had played in the Ibn Rifaca end Yemen intrigues ol his family, and promised to give him back all his property in Mecca and reimburse him for all his other losses• Mohamad Sadiq was then given a car and sent off to Mecca and to his family (kept as hostages) with the King’s blessings and hanosome present. Ro aoubt the good reception given to this personage, will be duly noted by those of the Allabbagh family still in exile, and should decice them to accept the King's amnesty. (b) Shaimn Shuqair ibn Shuoair of the Mutajr . This Shaikh (mentioned in para. 22 of Intelligence Summary Ro.2) stayed some d&amp;ye in Kuwait efter he had visitea me, ano according to H.K. the Ruler (10.2.35) begged h&amp;ru to be allowed to transfer his allegiance from Bin S&amp;ua to Kuwait. His Excellency added that the man stated to him that he, like the rest of the Mutair, was so utterly disgusted with the King's treatment of the tribe generally that he v«ith others only wented to get out of hejd to-day. The shaikh ssiti that he v ithwith difxiculty persuaded Shuqair to go home quietly, end not raise trouble for himself with the King. (c) An Ajman tribesman anu old friend of mine (whose name I shall rot mention for obvious reasons) recently (20.2.35) came in from Bin Saud’s camp at Al Khafs ena t ave me the following items of camp news, which may be accepted as correct; (i) Bin Saua was camped at Al Khafs with the Amir Sana, the ladies of his household anu junior members of hie family (ii) with the King and in constant attendance were Ibn Rashid (State prisoner), Ibn Hathlain (Khalid), Al luwish (Bandar), Rakan al JHathlain and other chiefs who the King thought it wise to keep near him today• (iii) Of the family of Al Saud, the following important members were with the Kint also Khalid bin Mohamea (nephew) ana Lis wife (Bin Saud 1 s daughter). Abdulla al Baud (brother) and his family. The well known Koora wife of Saud Al Arafa (Bin Baud*s sister and most faithful friend he haa) (iv) rohamed al Baud, ana Saua al Arafa, were camped in another part of the Bahana and spent their daj,s ’’hunting' . They were 'Zaalan” (angry). (v) The King when not actually himself hawking spent all his time in receiving visitors from distant parts of Arable *ho seemed to be increasing day by day', as time v,ore on.

THERE has been no occasion for some time past to deal in any separate despatch with the general internal situation in this country. Such meagre information as has been available and such rumours as have seemed to deserve attention have been embodied in the monthly Jedda reports. In chapter I of the report for December reference was made to the presence of various high personages at Mecca and the dissension and muddle thought to exist there. It now begins to emerge that various important matters of internal policy have been under consideration, and some of the results are gradually coming to light. 2. One of these results has been the publication in the Umm-al-Qura of the 25th January of a decree regarding the readmission of emigres, a translation of which I enclose. On the face of it, it is a document of considerable importance. Closer examination suggests a good deal of doubt as to its real scope, and the doubt is the more difficult to resolve, as the unofficial comments in the Umm-al-Qura are merely laudatory, and, if one can speak of such a thing as public opinion, its attitude towards such announcements is apt to be one of sceptical inertia. 3. The heading of the decree describes it as a general pardon or amnesty, and the word pardon recurs in article 2, but article 1 contains nothing in the nature of an amnesty for political offences, nor does it indicate the conditions to be imposed on emigres taking advantage of it. It is clear that it should enable certain persons to return whose absence has been due to the general political situation resulting from the change of regime, e.g., various members of the Shereefian family, and perhaps some persons who served the Hashimite Government, but have not been active abroad. Such persons will doubtless be expected to give assurances of their submission to the present regime and of then acceptance of Saudi nationality. 4. It is much more doubtful whether the decree amounts to an assured amnesty for persons, of the Dabbagh type, who have conspired against Ibn au , or for tribal personages who have been concerned in past revolts. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Ins Excellency the Viceroy of India, Foreign and Political Department; his Excellency the High Commissioner for Transjordan; His Majesty s Ambassador a „. a £ , Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire; His Majesty s Chief Commissioner at Aden; His Majesty s High Commissionei foi l.gypt, and his Excellency the Governor-General of the Sudan at Khartum.

WITH reference to my despatch No.J90of the 2nd October last, reporting the appointment of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, Minister of Finance, to be Deputy Minister of Defence, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the translations of two announcements by the latter Ministry regarding the small “ regular ” army maintained by Ibn Saud, which appeared in the Saut-al-Hejaz of the 26th November. The first relates to enlistment in the ranks and contains the conditions and terms of service, whilst the second announces the establish ment, as from the 16th January, 1935, of a military school at Mecca, where candidates for commissioned rank are to pursue a three years’ course of training. 2. This evidence of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s determination to strengthen and improve the present standing army of Saudi Arabia is of considerable interest. The development may be the fruit of experience gained during the war with the Yemen, though I am unable to believe that the Saudi regular forces are to be largely increased. The tribes, and notably the Ikhwan. will always be Ibn Saud’s most effective and least expensive military weapon. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

LegQtion f Jedda. Sth November, 1934. I have /the honour to inform you that on the 23rd October a consignment of six thousand rifles and three cases of machine-guns was landed at Jedda from the Kllerman, Hall boat S.S.'City of Christiania', chartered for the voyage by the Stride Line. These munitions f which were shipped at Antwerp, were imported by Xhalid A1 Qarqfini (Jedda Personalities No.57) on behalf of the Saudi Government. The rifles, which are Maueen^ are stated to be old and used German war-stock, dating from 1916. 2. The fact that Kh&amp;lid Al QarqAni has imported these articles from an obviously German source is of some interest as it is stated that he is now associated in business with a certain in&amp;chtig( 0 , or Haji QSsim as he is now better know*, formerly a clerk in the service of Herr de Haas, the lost German (trading) Consul here before the German Consulate was closed about two years ago. Haji Qasim is a young man of somewhat ambiguous antecedents, Balkan origin, 1b said to have served ae an officer in the Great War, subsequently drifting* f 01 * un* 010 * 1 * reaeone, to Jedda where he embraced Islam and exchanged Hight Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I.» K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc. ■E/f I -jexchanged KSchtigC?) for Haji Qtaim. 3. It seems not improbable, therefore, that this consignment of raunitione was ordered by Kh&amp;lid A1 &lt;iarq&amp;ni through HaJi ^asim, who would place the order through Herr de Haas in Germany. I am at present unaware of the latter* 8 whereabouts in Germany, but I am making discreet / enquiries and, should I succeed in obtaining hie address, will forward it to you in case further investigations into his business associations should promise information of interest. 4. That the enquiry may be worth pursuing is suggested by reports here that Khalid Al Qurq&amp;ni and Haji Qasim are making a strong bid for the Jecida-Kecca Railway Concession, in the market again since Dr. t&gt;eelani failed to follow it up, and it may be surmised that if anything at all is done it may be with the help of German capital and the use of German material. 6 .

Section 3. [E 7799/72/25J No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon—(Received December 31.) (No. 370.) Sir, Jedda, December 11, 1934. I HAVE the honour to refer to my despatch No. 351 of the 5th December, 1933, in which I ventured to submit a short review of the general financial situation in this country. I again propose to attempt, with the modest material available in a country where statistics of any value are unknown, an appreciation of the general financial and economic condition of Saudi Arabia at the present time. 2. Since the despatch under reference was written, the intervening months have witnessed little real alleviation of the financial difficulties with which Ibn Saud was then finding himself increasingly confronted. The principal drain on his resources, due to the long-drawn struggle with the Yemen, the necessity of providing for an army in the field and at the same time of cementing the loyalty of tribal leaders in Nejd by subsidies and supplies in kind, can scarcely have diminished until the operations came to a successful conclusion and the troops returned to their own country during July and August. Even then - demobilisation involved the grant of gratuities in rials and in kind to each individual soldier, a process which began at Taif upon the immediate return of the troops and continued at Riyadh until mid-November. Mr. Philby estimates the cost to Ibn Saud of these gratuities alone to be in the neighbourhood of £100,000 gold. Thus the whole period under review has been one of abnormal military expenditure, in prosecuting the war and, at its conclusion, in paying in hard cash a handsome insurance premium against tribal discontent at a lootless victory. , u . , 3. It may not unnaturally be asked where are the resources upon which the King could draw so liberally. Mr. Philby is convinced that t e ex P a1 ^^ lies in the receipt of a war indemnity from the Imam of the Yemen. a alone in considering this view difficult to accept, and incline o e . the King has found himself compelled, in order to content his returning soldiery to make serious inroads upon the Royal Treasury, a reservoir dimensions.^ ^ Exchequer could h ave proved of hardly be expected, even in the resourceful hands o e » stairm dutv Little additional taxation, except in the almost neg igi e , was ma( le was imposed and in spite of certain reports to the con ra , as far as can be ascertained, to the exaction of ^ rce n represented 5. The revenue, which in the despatch under reference ^J^f^et as exiguous, has probably shown ^ ^ooO^n comparison with 20,000 expenditure. The pilgrimage of 1934 ld act ivitv in the bazaars of the year before and pilgrim dues to the G ^ ^ forthc oming pilgrimage were stimulated in proportion, ihe prospe • to eX p e ct a slight are still conjectural, but it may not be excess! P ar( j to general increase again in 1935. The remarks m last yea s P , ^ efforts of Talaat level of poverty of latter-day pilgrims sti a PP J’ d elsewhere, are directed Harb Pasha, upon whose activities I have ^ported eisevvn^ towards inducing Egyptians of the wealthier so ^ un k n0 wn factors in Saudi 6. Customs receipts are still one of the severaium ^ ^ ^ Arabia’s economic equation. One might P^ P ^ j ncrease in the pilgrimage has this year been a slight improvemen . hands of local merchants and the partial lie piidation of old stocks of ^’n ^ mortgaged as must have exerted a favourable influence. ec , system of drafts to which a has been now the practice for some years by the ^ysten reference was made in the despatch un er■2 7 The Saudi Government’s revenue has been augmented this year, it j 8 ■ stated bv the receipt during the early summer of £20,000 gold from the Standard Oil Company of California, a sum believed to represent the second instalment of the initial loan promised by the company under the terms of their Hasa oil concession. A further loan, said to be very small is reported to have been J obtained in November from Talaat llarb l ash a, and is thought probably to be secured on Saudi pilgrim dues, which will be paid by Egyptians during the forthcoming Haj. Mr. Philby, at any rate, was made happy by being paid “£2 000 or £3,000,” half in cash and half m a draft on Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Ridha and Co., confidential agents and importers to the Saudi authorities, not in respect, I understand, of outstanding debts, but to finance the import of motor vehicles in accordance with his concession. 8 Indeed, the position of the Saudi Government m regard to both their internal and foreign obligations is as unsatisfactory as ever. Certainly no attempt has been made during the year under review to meet the long outstanding debts due to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, and Ibn Sand appears unlikely to‘manifest any great readiness to do so in the near future. 9 The Minister of Finance has continued to pursue a policy of rigid economy in Government expenditure, although the opinion has been heard that money for day to day requirements of an essential nature, is not so tight as was the case a year ago. Official salaries are still seriously in arrear and for more than the first six months of the Arabic year 1353 (until the end of October) Government servants had received a bare two months salary, and that at the “ par ” rate of 10 rials to 110 piastres miri gold (£1 gold), whereas the current rate for rials had fluctuated between 24 and 22 rials to the gold pound. 10. Saudi currency during the year has remained relatively steady and did not show any marked tendency to depreciate after the last pilgrimage, as I anticipated in my despatch under reference. The rial rate varied within the limits indicated above, and at the time of writing is 22, betraying again the customary appreciation which marks the arrival of pilgrims from abroad. 11. The general tone of trade in the Hejaz is stated to be somewhat healthier, the manager of the Dutch banking concern here, the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, stating that during the past year there had been slightly more movement and much less reluctance on the part of merchants to take up bills. This applied particularly to the past six months. I am indebted to him for the following figures compiled by himself and, he insists, very tentative, or the imports and exports for the Arabic years 1351 and 1352 :— Imports Exports 1351 £ sterh-ig. 2,028,000 1352. £ sterling. 1,657,850 150,685 Piece-goods and flour, amongst the more important commodities, showed an increase in 1352 over 1351, most others falling away in the second year. Ijj number of different headings of commodities imported was only 108 in 1*V as compared with 149 in 1351. These figures, partial and approximate thoug they may be and although they relate, except for the last part of 1352, to the years prior to the period covered by this survey, are nevertheless of some interest. 12. The picture drawn in the foregoing paragraphs may indicate a a from satisfactory condition, but it is not one of wholly unrelieved gloom, y ni there is still considerable and serious destitution amongst the poorer c ^ ss( r which the distribution of food and clothing by Ibn Baud and the charity ot ~'ii a: J J - A 11 * ' ■’ | of living is not appreciably well-disposed do higher to the consider ablv little to Hejazi. alleviate.

CONFIDENTIAL. December 18, 1934. Section 1. [E 7545/77/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 18.) (No. 360.) Sir, Jedda, December 4, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No. 349 of the 27th November last, relative to the Egyptian commercial and financial mission to this country, I have the honour to report that Talaat Harb Pasha, Midhat Yeghen Pasha and party (with the exception of Kemal Bey Aloui, who left the same day for Egypt by Khedivial mail steamer) left for Yanbu by air on the 28th November and after visiting Medina by car resumed their return journey to Egypt on the 1st December. 2. Talaat Pasha’s visit this year is shorter than was expected and only two whole days were put in at Mecca. By some this is thought to be due to his dissatisfaction at being refused permission to fly to Riyadh to see the King. His donations to schools and hospitals were on a modest scale, according to report, but free distribution as charity of piece-goods and other Egyptian manufactures, which had not taken place when I wrote my despatch under reference, was subse quently undertaken on behalf of the Egyptian mission by the Jedda municipality on the 4th December. 3 I learn that Talaat Pasha was primarily interested m arranging with the Saudi authorities for further facilities this year for Egyptian pilgrims. The shipping agents will continue to be Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Reza and Co., according to their own account, and financial arrangements, which are said to include the perception of Saudi pilgrim dues from the individual pilgrims by Banque Misr and payment to the Saudi Arab Government in a lump sum wi be handled by Banque Misr or separately appointed agents here. Two large motor-launches, to seat 100 passengers each, are to be brought here bv Banque Misr in order to facilitate the transport of pilgrims from the outei anchorage in the heavy seas. The present charges for sambuqs are to remain undisturbed and the local interests involved are not to sufier. Indeed it appears tlmt Ta Pasha has been at pains to assure local merchants and sh'ppersthathy*! are not to deprive them of the benefits they now enjoy from the pygnmage, but to ensure gre.Jr eon,for. for „„d Me™, no. par.,, oeeupie,. b&gt; ' “l 6 °I~ IStSlS. ».«,»« b, Mr “ K;tSKTn ment have obtained from Talaat 1 asha a loan, P r0 . jjj | p a pj ) )V the nature of an advance on account of pilgrims dues, which will paw ny Egyptian pilgrims coming on Haj Manzaleh flying the Egyptian flag, 5.

(i) Local opinion is interested in news (November 12.th) of trouble between King Bin 3aud and Bin Rumman of Taimah. Bin Rumman is said to have built a wall round Taimah and to nave filled in all wells near Taimah in order to make it difficult to beseige him. Abdul Aziz bin Musaad, Amir of Hail, is said to have gone to Riyadh to discuss steps to be taken against Bin Rumman. An earlier rumour (November 7th) said that Bin Rumman had gone to the Palestine border.P.Z.6999/34. CA ► «trw (A to. Extract Irom Kuwait Intelligence SummeLry,No,10 of 1934 For the period from 1st October to 31st October,1934. 104, Many Bedouin rumours of a Saudi campaign against Taima have been current during October. Latest reports (29•10.34) from Hail, and brought into Kuwait by one of the Shaikh 1 s Shammar retainers, are to the effect that Abdul Kerim ibn Rumman of Taima (12 days journey on camel west of Hail) is now well in the black books of Bin Saud, and that the latter has sent orders to Bin Musa'ad, Governor of Hail to proceed against him, extract back taxes and generally punish him. Ibn Musa'ad has accordingly given out that he is proceeding to Palestine to punish the Yahud (Jews) and has ordered large Shammar contingents to rendezvous at JAUF. Ibn Rumman in the meantime naturally suspects that he is the intended victim and is said to have filled in e wells far and near on the routes leading to Taima and preparing to resist. i^dEHT . The Shaikh of Kuwait places little credence on the ove reports, as he says Bin Saud obviously must have time recover from the effects of the Yemen War. At the same ne for Ibn Musa'ad to take the trouble to say that Palestine his objective in a coming large raid and that he wants to dish the Jews (a report which me^Bedouins confirm) is newhat suspicious. The fact also that several large ravans of Rice and dates are reported to have recently and Hoffuf for Hail makes the writer think that £ be in the wind. something mayP.Z.6999/34. tract ^rom Kuwait Intelligence Suimjary,Ko, 1C ol* 1934 I^r the period from lot October to 31st October, 1934.

(a; : ince the writer returned from leave, he has found many opportunities of discussing past Yeiaen events with a number of Bedouin trans-border chiefs, as well as with the Shaikh of Kuwait and notables of the Town. On all sides he has been told that Bin Saud has definitely lost much 'prestige” as a result of the ar. ISrerywhere the belief is very strong that had Bin Saud been strong enough, nothing in the world would have prevented him from over-running or crushing Yahya. He however found himself in imminent danger after his seizure of Hodeida, of being surrounded and hie armies destroyed so he wisely obeyed the instincts of self-reservation and made the peace he did. Yahya was also satisfied, being an old man and without aggressive ideas - for had he not won the moral victory and forced Bin Sand to withdraw, without so muoh as surrendering an inch of Yemen territory, or paying a rial by woy of indemnity? (h) The barren Kejran after all was no gain to ^in ud, but has merely been given to her own people, the Yam Ibo, who are blood brothers of the Hurra and Ajman tribes. (o) The above is the appreciation of the aituation ong Bin sauda great tribes and the people of Kuwait, and believe sums up the situation correctly. (d) Since the Kind's return to Riath he has been nerously rewarding the Shaikhs and other prominent rsons who helped to receive at all those who failed to swer his call to arms. The latter are all known, and Mr munes have been recorded 0ar efully, and they willno doubt be dealt with when Bln Saud feels hHaaelf strong enough to do so. (e) Aooordlng to Ibn Mussaillla of the Bashalda.Bln Saud is now unlrersaliy hated, where in the old days he was respected and even lored. One of the causes that have brought about this, is worth recording. Apparently in the past when two sections or individuals of a tribe quarrelled and broke t -- peaue * ^e* -iin Saud, used to investigate the oase carefully and punish the wrong-doer. Today he ferociously seizes the best property in oauels and sheep of the whole tribe for allowing* ut; lie the incident to haye happened. The uedouin in ocher words leel that the innocent as well as guilty are being punished and resent it in proportion. [x) To distract attention from himself and once more daiigle before the eyes of some of his stalwarts the idea of booty, it is widely stated that he has recently been talking much of another campaign.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HiS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT r—r EASTERN (Arabia).

As ^ ou are aware, the Minister of Finance has for some time, and notablv during the recent conflict with the Yemen, effectively performed the functions of Minister of War. 2.

Sir, £ ^SSr /ith reference to my despatch No.56 of February 27, I hare the honour to state that I had occasion to call on the Saudi Minister of finance on March 11 and took the opportunity of speaking to hin further about the Hejas Development Corporation Ltd, I said that the further information I had received since our last interview added little that was material to what I had then told him but that it certainly confirmed the view that the composition of the Corporation was not such as to inspire much confidence. I then explained that the registration of a company in ngland was a mere formality, by which any group of persons could invest themselves with s corporate existence, and meant nothing more. 2. Sheykh 1 Abdullah Suleyrain said that the Government had not wished to leave the telegram, which he had shown me on Pebruaiy 11, unanswered. They had therefore expressed readiness to receive proposal, from any properly authorised person. 'Abdul liamla Bey qhedld had not been able to get anythin etl . te /from The ight Honourable, Sir John Simon, 0 , 0 ,SsI*f KhC,V.O#t etc, , etc., « t0 « t jfrom the Corporation before he left Jedda but had since telegran ied that they eere Bending a representative who was expected to arrive in Egypt on March 12 or 13.

I gather from Mr^Philby, who is doubtless om of the other sources mentioned in the first sentence of this paragraph, if not the only one, that the reason for not answering the latest telegram from 'Abdul iamtd Shedld is that the Government do not consider that it complies with the terns on which they had expressed readiness to receive proposals.

I have the honour to be with the highest resoect. Sir, Your most obedient, mmble servant, ■i WiM MQPA^U?! b;/ Mr A^ndrow After speaking about other matters, separately recorded, Mr, * Abdul ohdnl Ydlibl explained to Mr. Purlonge and myself on March 17 the bank scheme which he said he was propounding to the Saudi Government. The sc eme is to create a Bank with a capital of £.1,0) ,000 sterling. The Baud! Government would put un half of this (or £.550,000, ' r.Ydlibi threw in) and a British bank the other half. This capital would be applied to the purchase of British ~-ar Loan, to be deposited in the Bank of England. The Bank would issue notes on a sterling basis, which would be the only currency in this country - apparently a forced currency. Such notes Tould be issued up to the limit of the capital; not beyond. All Government receipts would be paid into the sank and it would conduct all transactions in foreign currencies. I asked (a) whether Mr. Ydlibi had reason to think that the Saudi Government could put up the proposed share of the capital; and (b) whether he was assured of the support of a bank in Great Britain as regards the other half. As regards (a) Mr. Ydlibi said that the Government would doubtless have to make its contribution by stages. Mr. Purlonge understood him to say that, if they could not find all or some of the money, the British partners would lend it to them at interest, an important point which I missed. As regards (b) Mr. Ydlibi said that he had not ye enlisted the support, but he anticipated no difficulty. Hxe business would be perfectly secure, as the capital would be held by the Bank of Kng and. I tried to elucidate the position which would be /createdcreated as regards general banking. ’• Wr.Ydllbl wryuXO. naVC 8 all banking and foreign exchange Tf'CS® #*% 1 a _ a inquire a very strong financial police to enforce Mr * YdUbl 8ald that the Saudi Oovernment would gain by &gt;m vlng a stable and secure monetary system on a sterling basis and (b) by receiving a half share of the profits of the Bank. he said that the scheme was similar to that which had been adopted in *Iraq and which had yielded a profit of some £.100,000 in 1932. j asked whether the Saudi Government were to get a loan. He replied with a definite negative and said tnat he had made this quite clear to the Saudi Government. Mr. Ydlibi said that the vinister of finance had appro««hed the scheme. He seemed to hope that this, like hie oil concession, might go through before he leaves Jedda on March 21, /fe for Mr. Ydlibi&lt; I told him that his scheme sounded interesting but I refrained from asking him too many Questions. It is, I think, a definite part of hi a ftammui method to represent his projects as being much more /advancedadvanced at any given moment than they actually are. I cannot believe that the Saudi Government would in present circumstances Jump at any scheme, which did not promise immediate ready money. m this connexion it is worth nothing that on March 11, -r.miby spoice or 'Awayni as having come back a week before without a V concrete financial offer. At the time I took this to refer to the oil schemes, but it may be that it really arose out of the nature of the Hank scheme. A! though the Ydlibi-jAwayni combine have hitherto been little heard of in connexion with definite proposals tor a sank, they have doubtless been considering the matter for some time. it will be remembered that a year ago ’Awayni went to J?iyldh to try and dissuade the King at the last moment from proceeding with the concession to the ex-Khedive and ’Abduli* Hamid Shedld.

(No. 360.) ^ r ’ Jedda, December 12, WIIH reference to my despatch No. 352 of the 5th instant, relative to the visit ot an Egyptian commercial and financial mission, under the leadership of laJaat Pasha Xarb, to this country, I have the honour to report that the members of the mission left by air for Yenbu on the morning of the 10th December, intending to journey by car thence to Medina and, returning the second day, to resume their flight to Egypt. 2. Ihe programme followed whilst they were in this country conformed closely to that reported in my despatch under reference. Talaat Pasha Narb left Jedda by car on the 6th December for Mecca, where he was entertained bv Amir Feisal, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Muhammad-el- Fadhl, and returned on the 8th, when he dined with Mr. and Mrs. Philby. 3. The results of the visit, in so far as they are known, or partially known, may be stated under the following heads :— (a) Banque Misr. —I am informed by the manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), that his firm have been given, for the time being, the agency of the Banque Misr as regards its purely banking business. Mr. Warner expressed the opinion, however, that it would not be long before the Banque Misr established a branch of their own in this country. (b) Local Representation for Pilgrim Ships. —It is understood that this has been given to the local firm of Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Ridha. It was stated on the 8th December that, although no written agreement had at the time been signed, yet Talaat Pasha Narb had definitely promised the representation of this shipping interest to the local firm. Mr. Warner, in this connexion, stated that his firm had been given the handling of the money of Egyptian pilgrims, probably qua agents of the Banque Misr. (c) Pilgrimage by Air from Egypt. —It is believed that this question has received some consideration during the stay of the mission, though I am unaware of the result, if any. I have received Ihe impression that the Saudi Arab Government have not proved very receptive to this idea. (d) Sale of Egyptian Products—l am not at present in possession of information on the activities of the mission in regard to the organisation of the sale of Egyptian products. The gratis distribution of such goods, to which I referred in my last despatch, was, I find, not confined ^o the poor alone, but was liberally used as commercial ground-bait in business circles as well. 4 4.

His pilot was Mr. G. J. Mahony, of Misr-Airwork. I 2. It is still early to learn more than I was able to report in mv desnatch under reference as to the objects of his visit and the measure of success he is likely to achieve. I understand from my Egyptian colleague that Talaat Pasha is pleased with his reception by the Saudi authorities. Sheikh Abdullah bmeima 11 , the Minister of Finance, has been in Jedda during the past two days, and 1 learn that conversations have been proceeding at the Kandara Palace where the members of the mission are being entertained as the guests of the baudi Government. 3. Talaat Pasha, whom I met for a short time to-day, informed me that he proposed to leave for Mecca by car to-morrow and expected to return in two or three days’ time. He would take to the air again on the 9th December for Yanbu. whence he intended to go to Medina by car, returning to resume his iourney to Egypt from Yanbu two days later. 4. His visit has naturally received a good deal of local attention, and has, it is believed, excited considerable interest in Government circles. One is inclined to wonder how far Fuad Bey Hamza, during his leave, which was partly spent in Egypt, was instrumental in preparing the ground for this visit. At any rate, the obvious intention of Talaat Pasha is to create an impression as favourable to the objects he has in view as he r - ibly can. The D.H. Dragon aeroplane has been partly occupied since its i.i.ival in carrying out short demonstration flights for the benefit of both European and native passengers. I am also informed by mv Egyptian colleague that Talaat Pasha, to mark the occasion, brought with him a large selection of goods, probably of Egyptian manufacture, for distribution as charity to the poor of this country. It is pleasant to observe this pious practice, one of the five obligations of the true Moslem, going so happily hand in hand with, and sanctifying, cc more material commercial purpose. I hope to be in a position to report further on this matter in due course. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt.

Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 28.) (No. 351.) Sir, Jsddo DscsTubsv 5 1933 IN my telegram No.i97.of the 15th November I had the honour to’indicate certain aspects of the local financial situation which might have a bearing on the Saudi attitude towards repayment of their debts. I submit herewith a somewhat fuller review of the situation. 2. All indications are that the Saudi Government are making the most determined efforts to reduce expenditure to a minimum and to lose no chance of augmenting their income, in order to leave themselves the widest possible margin for the heavy expenditure entailed by the military preparations now being undertaken. T he latter are, of course, on a scale unparalleled in the history of this country, for tribal contingents from every quarter of Arabia have now been sent south, together with all available munitions, including even such items as a battery of field-guns from Medina brought in by the Turks before the Great War. The tribesmen receive little or no actual pay, but need equip ment, food and transport; a recent Mecca estimate put the present expenditure under this head at £5,000 a day. The figure is doubtless exaggerated and will be reduced in any case once the army has been transported to the required area, but even a tenth of this figure would be a sufficient drain on the Saudi income. To minimise it, the Government have recently taken to themselves importing such necessaries as paraffin, rice and sugar through certain old and trusted local firms such as Haji Zeinal Ali Ridha, with whom the Minister of Finance has 3. The revenue has diminished almost to vanishing point. As you are aware, the bulk of it is derived from two sources, pilgrims and customs receipts. The pilgrimage of 1933, 20,000, was the worst since the inauguration of the Saudi regime, and the prospects for 1934 tend to suggest that little, if any, improvement can be looked for. At present three pilgrim ships have arrived from the Straits and Java, bearing exiguous cargoes of pilgrims, and bookings are reported poor. The decline in the average value of pilgrims is moreover noticeable. Better-class and rich pilgrims are becoming rarer, and the tendency seems to be more and more for the pilgrimage to be confined to peasants, who bring with them the minimum sum necessary to do the pilgrimage in the cheapest manner. This reduces the total of their purchasing power and with it that of the shopkeepers and other classes of Hejazi who live by them. 4. The decline in customs receipts cannot be measured, for no statistics are available, but must be considerable. The decreased number of pilgrims, the uncertainty of future numbers, the decline in the purchasing power of the people, the excessive increase of customs dues last May (see Jedda despatch No. 154) and the heavy stocks still held by local merchants as a legacy from the last eighteen months, have all contributed to the reduction of imports. Figures contributed privately by the Director of Customs are remarkable, dining the first eight months of the current Arabic year (April to November .1^^) number of packages imported through Jedda was 9,847, as compaied with 48,735 during a similar period last year. i u i c 5. Customs receipts are in any case heavily mortgaged by the system or drafts which the Saudi Government have adopted to an increasing extent in the last two years as a means of satisfying creditors without paying them. Iuad Bey Hamza told me on the 1st December that no such drafts had been issued since the beginning of the current Arabic year. My information suggests t at this statement is not entirely accurate, and that certain favouied creditors, notably the importing firm mentioned in paragraph 2, have, in effect, leceived been in relations since his Bombay days. This practice has hit other merchants hard.2 such drafts; and that, moreover, these new drafts are ' 101) per cent.” ones, i e allowing the importer to admit goods free ot all duty until the amount of the draft is paid off, instead of the “ 25 per cent, once formerly issued which merely entitle him to write off one-quarter of the amount ot duty on each consignment while paying the remaining three-quaiteis in cash. In any case the total of the drafts issued previous to this Arabic year and still unredeemed must be very large. The Soviets are stated to hold such drafts in respect of their 1931 importation of kerosene and benzine, but to be holding them until such time as they can import with less certainty of loss. 6 All Government revenue is collected—one might say snatched—at the earliest moment and remitted to Riyadh. Forced loans on merchants, which were such a feature of the autumn of 1931, have not been in evidence, principally because of the lack of merchants rich enough to afford them, though this method was recently resorted to to pay Mr. Philby for a consignment of tyres. A tendency to* impose new taxes, for example, on motor launches and on water- carts, is, however, noticeable. . 7. Meantime other Government expenditure is cut down to the barest minimum. Official salaries are even more in arrear than usual ; for many months employees were being paid on the principle one-third cash, one-third kind, one-third carried forward,” but even this has now been modified to “ all carried.” Bribing is consequently even easier, cheaper and more prevalent than before. Money is refused for all kinds of necessary and even profitable expenditure; the condenser engineer laments the lack of essential spares, and the piping necessary to supply Jedda with good water is not forthcoming. Even contingency allowances for Government offices have of late been held up. Redemption of debt, in such an atmosphere, seems the height of improbability. 8. The currency position reflects the general situation : the Saudi rial, which a year ago stood at 18-| to the £ gold and two years ago at 17^, is now fluctuating round 26. The value of its silver content is understood to be about 30 and. while at the moment it is showing a slight tendency to rise, as it does each year before the pilgrimage on account of the demand for it created by the arrival of pilgrims, the general opinion is that, after the pilgrimage, it will depreciate to nearly 30. - 1 9. Despite the catalogue of depression in the preceding paragraphs, there is some reason to believe that the regime is in reality far from bankrupt and that its protestations of poverty are the result of Semitic cupidity and dislike of disbursement, far more than of actual lack of money. The Minister of I Finance has been noticed to be far less worried than he might be expected to be and the Royal Family still seem able to afford luxury cars. The money, however, it is agreed, is not in the Hejaz, but where it has been remitted so steadily and so long by the faithful Minister of Finance—Riyadh. 10.

I HAVE the honour to report that Talaat Harb Pasha, who is described in No. 45 of the List of Leading Personalities in Egypt, enclosed in Cairo despatch No. 68 of the 9th January, as a Senator and chairman of directors of the Banque Misr, is understood locally to be flying from Suez to Jedda, with stops at Wejh and Yanbu, on or about the 2nd December, in a De Havilland Dragon aeroplane belonging to Messrs. Misr-Airwork; a ground engineer sent by the latter to prepare the ground for landing arrived by steamer on the 19th November, and the agency work for it has been entrusted to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), Jedda. 2. Talaat Pasha’s objects in this visit, which is not expected to exceed four days, are said to be threefold, viz., (a) to fix up local representation for the two pilgrim ships, which, I understand, have recently been purchased by the Egyptian Government for the conveyance of Egyptian pilgrims to and from the Hejaz; (b) to organise the sale of Egyptian products in this country, in particular the cotton goods which are said to be produced nowadays by a subsidiary company of the Banque Misr; and (c) to explore the possibility of the Banque Misr opening a branch in Jedda to assume the functions of a State bank for the Hejaz, in view ot the apparent demise of the ex-Khedive’s project (see the correspondence ending with your confidential despatch No. 266 of the 5th October). 3 To these objects may, perhaps, be added a fourth, namely, that oi demon strating: one of Misr-Airwork’s aeroplanes to Ibn Sand. You will recall that this company last year proposed to send an Avro to Jedda for this purpose (see t e correspondence ending with the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt s Savingram to you, No. 91 of the 19th August, 1932) but did not proceed with the scheme. Their object at that time was to sell Ibn Sand light mihtary airuaft, and it seems probable that the recent reports of tension between him and *e Imam Yehya have led them to consider the moment opportune for a serious etot to this end.'

As I hare reported from Jedda Mr. Philby nowadays speaks to me pretty freely. I told him that I made use of what he told me for the information of His Majesty’s Government but that, subject to this, he could always rely on me to respect his confidence and avoid compromising him. Saudi Financial Situation . Mr. Philby expressed disappointment that the Saudi Government alleging their preoccupation with the Yemeni danger, seemed indisposed to use any part of the money received from Standard Oil of California to effect part payment of their debts, the outstanding balance of which he estimates at something like £150,000 gold, including the debts in which he is interested (Marconi, Standard Oil of New York,Sharctf.eh Limited and, I think, ?ord) which he now puts at about £50,000 gold. He said that he had got the interest on all these debts, between £2,000 and £3,000 - a statement which does not quite agree with what he told me sometime ago in Jedda. He had no idea what the Saudi Government would do when the present moratorium expires in November next* He agreed that they would do well to make some sort of businesslike arrangement and stick to it but seemed to take a very moderate view of the likelihood of their doing so This-w Thle record of a friendly conrereatlon over the tea-table may not be exact In erery particular, but It represents with sufficient accuracy the main lines of what Mr# Philby told me# (Signed) Andrew Ryan.

The Saudi (rovemment early in July started enforcing their latest Customs Tariff as approved by the King in the Persian Gulf region* This works out from 80^ ad valorem to 200$ according to the nature of goods. The unwisdom of this move with unrest in Najd and everywhere on the increase, ought to have been patent to a child, but the King apparently is determined to take the advice of his amateur financial and customs advisers, such as Abdullah bin culaiman and Mohomed al Tawil, etc. The worst feature of these new customs duties is that it taxes out of all reason the peoples food and necessities of life. For instance duty on sugar is now 119$, on rice 40$, and on matches which is as important as actual food to the Hajdi and Bedouin, 200$. The re^ulJL of these ferocious duties has been to greatly increase the already deep hatred and resentment which certainly all over Najd and Hassa and North East Arabia is felt for Bin Baud, and which will certainly be taken advantage i of by his Northern neighbours. The Bedouin everywhere and openly pray for the day when the King will either die, or will smash himself against Yemen or Asir. Bin Baud does not appear to realise that his people who grow nothing and produce nothing (I refer in particular to the Bedouin tribes) are starving: They will not be able to stand the strain I much longer. They must either revolt on a large scale or start fighting each other to get food. Bin Jaud f s j subsidies which hitherto have kept the tribes quiet, have either been stopped or been greatly reduceu. ihe ^.nttflarv result, of the new duties has been to givegreat impetus? to the contraband trade into Najd from Kuwait. The same I understand applies in the case of Bahrain also. In spite of the activities of Ibn Jaloui f s frontier patrols, ever increasing numbers of Najd tribesmen, are secretly finding their way into Kuwait, with the deliberate intention of trying to run rice, sugar, tea and other foodstuffs into the interior. They are desparate mefc, driven on by the haunting knowledge that their families are on the vergejof starvation. These blockade breakers tell me (I often have talks with them), that if they lose four contraband cargoes, either through capture, or destruction by their own hand, and get away with a fifth caravan, it will still pay them. Buch are the high prices that rule in Bin Baud’s dominions. The following incident which occurred on the 14th July is an example of the desperation to which the Bedouins are being driven, and I fear we have not heard the end of the incident, for Bin Baud’s arm is still long, and he seems to delight in revenging himself on his poor subjects these days. Two small caravans numbering 2 b and 21 camels respectively, consisting of Braih tribesmen (Mutair) whose main camp is at Hafar al iatin, left Kuwait on the 11th July. By prearrangement they travelled separately their plan being to meet somewhere in the Dahana and then make for ^asim, after getting through the Blockade ring&gt; The first party reached Shaib al Fao 20 miles south west of Hafar when were pursued and challenged by one of Hamud al Bagaawi's patrols. It being dark a fight ensued, and the caravan guards drove off the patrol by rifle fire. There were no casualties, but the contra bandists knowing the patrol would return with reinforcementsand feeling that with their laden camels they could not escape, deliberately unloaded their merchandise, piled it up in a heap and set it on fire. They themselves scattered and have not been found yet. The second party unfortunately and quite accidently ran into the reinforced patrol, a piece of real bad luck, as they were some 25 miles away from the scene of the first incident. Again a fight took place. This time A1 Sharaafi al Dausiri, the Commander of Bin 'laud’s men was killed, and also one of Bin Jaloui’s 'Murra' ,f trackers n , who are employed by the Blockade authorities to 'run down' suspected contraband runners. The patrol again beat a retreat and again the merchandise was heaped up and burnt by the owners. The contrabandists suffered no loss and dispersed. It soon became known, however, from spies located in Kuwait that the two parties belonged to the Braiij, and Al Bagaawi was not slow to strike. He seized 200 camels of the tribe, and threatened Bin Baud’s vengence, unless the names of the culprits were given him. This has not been done as yet but a Bhamari residing with the tribe has been handed over and made a scapegoat of. On the 18th July Ibn Ashwan, Ali al Shuwairibat and Ibn Jarbua, all leading Shaikhs of the tribe, decided to go to Riath and lay their case before the King. Ali al Shuwaribat and Ibn Jarbua returned after they reached the iiahana, their hearts failing them, and Ibn Ashwan proceeded alone. Although the incident in our eyes appears small it is of first class importance araon? the Mutair. Should Braih get no change out of Bin Saud, and fail, to recover their camels, it is on the cards that they will attempt a mass entry into Iraq via Bulaimiyeh, etc. The above incidents have in no way deterred the manyExtra ct from Kuwait Intellie-ftncft Summary for July. 1933. Promin ent t ribal Personalitie s to Kuwait. During the month the following Shaikhs visited the Political Agent. (a) Sha&amp;ifan Abu Shujara (Ajman) on 12th July 1933. (b) Lafi Ibn Maalath (Mutair) on 9th July 1933. (c) Mutluq as Sur (Mutair) on 25th July 1933. All three are refugees in Iraq and receive allowances from King Faisal like Khalid ibn Hathlain (Zeb Sahman). (a) resides with the Dhafir (in Iraq territory) at present (k) ' with Ibn Hathlain and Naif ibn Humaid, etc. and more or less accompany the Amarab (Anaze) in their various movements. ( c ) ' on the King*s personal estates in Baghdad. All three Shaikhs are personal friends of mine, and their movements and news are always a source of interest. Lest it be reported in London bj Shaikh Hafidh Wahba, Bin Saud*s clever representative there, that the presence of these men in Kuwait, presages something evil, such as a filibustering expedition into Najd or Hassa, or a rising of the Ajman, etc., as recently was the case when Khalid ibn Hathlain visited Kuwait, I give below a short sketch of the recent doings of each Shaikh. (a) Shaaifan abu Shujara t as stated lives with the Dhafir at present. He went north in June to the vicinity of Aleppo to visit his 3 sons who are in the French Syrian Camel Corps Service (a rather remarkable thing incidentally for members of the Ajman tribe of Hassa to do). His visit to Kuwait was to get a present from the Shaikh (an annual affair 'aada') and to see me and other Ajman relations residing in this town, and of course to gather news for his present master. When/When I asked why he did not go back to his tribe, he said because of Bin Saud. To use his own words as nearly as possible he said that Bin Saud f s word was no longer of any value and even if he swore by God and the Koran no Bedouin would ever trust him again, so black was his treachery during the Akhwan rebellion and after. Bin Jeloui he said was his one friend among the A1 Saud, though a hard and stern man, but even Bin Jaloui would not be able to save him from the King these days. He repeated what the wholeBedouin world is apparently saying today, that Bin Saud had got into the hands of certain non Arabians like FUAD Hamza and Jussuf Yassin who were adventurers pure and simple, and that these men had taught the King every deception, deceit and unworthy conduct in dealing with his subjects and in particular had taught him that it was no sin to break your word with a Bedouin. He laughingly and amusingly summed up the King’s character as his tribe saw it today, in the following words. 'Bin Saud is the greatest present giver, and most wonderful person in the whole world to win a man’s confidence, if it suited him. At the same time, in treachery, cunning, cruelty and revengefulness he had no equal in all the world. Lastly in playing with foreign nations and their representatives, and especially in making the English nation dance to his tune, he was entirely first class, and unmatchable in all the world'. Shaikh Shaaifan left Kuwait for the Dhafir in Iraq on the 20th July. (b) ibn Maalath came to Kuwait to see if his tribe had been able to fix up something with the King whereby he could safely return to Najd. His case is rather asad one and exemplifies the hard methods of Bin Sand with those who have the misfortune to cross him innocently, oix months ago shaikh Laafi, who at one time was one of Bin Sand's most stalwart and trusty warriors, was camped in the 'Summan' with his family. His brother came into Kuwait to see friends, and on his return was given a bag of rice value Rs. 9/- by Hillal al Mutairi the Pearl Merchant for Shaikh Laafi. On the journey he was caught by a blockade patrol who confiscated the rice. The patrol who had been told for whom the bag of rice was intended next tried to arrest Laafi. They arrived at his camp and ordered him to accompany them to Bin Jaloui in Hassa. Laafi f s own retainers some 27 in number, thought otherwise and quietly told the patrol to depart in peace, else they would kill them all. The patrol nothing loath did so and reported events to Hamud al Bagaawi who passed it on to the King. Shaikh Laafi realising that the game was up saddled his camel and all alone sped north and joined the Najd refugees at King Pailsal's Court. His family, goods and all he possessed in the world he left behind. Such are the methods whereby good men are turned into outlaws and refugees in the good Kingdom of Saudiyah. His return would of course mean his undoing. Shaikh Laafi returned to Iraq on the 27th July. (c) Miitliq al Sur . Came to Kuwait to get money out of Hilal al Mutairi his protege and incidentally to give him news of his Trans Jordan visit. He had been sent by King Faisal from Baghdad to Amman with the 4 valuable camels which were bought in Kuwait last April (see para ?I of Summary No. 81 of 26th April 1933) and which the King decided to present to his brother Abdulla. Mutluq's description of the journey across the desert (he took 25 days), and of the things he saw and heard at were amusing and interesting. He incidentally broughtvarious very cordial messages for the Shaikh and myself from Amir Abdulla which might have been true or inventions of the wily Mutluq. They were all verbal. Quite possibly he also brought a secret letter for the Shaikh from the Amir. Shaikh Mutluq returned to Baghdad on the 28th July. Note. It might not be out of place here to mention for the benefit of those who do not know, that there is little that goes on among the North East tribes of Najd and Hassa which does not come to my ears. I spend many hours weekly talking to Bedouin Shaikhs, both high and low, and visiting their tents. Shaikhs, ordinary tribesmen and even the poorest of tribal women know they will find a welcome in my house, and more often than not go away with some small present or other - the ladies usually with i a bag of rice or dates. Should there be any trouble brewing over the border I should be the first to know about it, for my visitors keep nothing back. As the cold weather approaches I return the compliment and go and camp with my Bedouin friends of all classes and sometimes for days at a time, not as an Englishman but as one of them. IV. Naid. Yemen and Asir Ifewa . News from Riath has been obscure and somewhat disturbing during July. Rumours have been persistent that the King intends with the advent of the autumn to undertake some major operation in the direction of Asir and Yemen. From Bedouin sources it is reported that Bin Baud has again started collecting arms, camels and horses in Biath, and on a considerable scale and has instructed Ibn Jaloui in Hassa to 'tap' the Awazim tribe for camels. The Awazim supplied nothing during the winter and spring campaign of 1932-1983. It is even said that the tribe as a whole has been ordered to hold itself in readiness to send a large quota of its young men to Asir. A certain Kuwait merchant writing from Hodeida to the Shaikh- 5 - on the 8th July said that there were indications everywhere, that fighting would commence with the cold weather between Bin Baud and the Imam Yahya, and that he, the writer, had felt it is his duty to warn other Kuwait merchants further North to be ready to close down their business at a momenta notice. The same Kuwait subject in a letter written to the Shaikh dated Hodeida the 27th July which arrived by air mail from Karachi gave the following more definite news. (a) Na Iran . Saif al Islam Ahmad with 2,000 Yemen troops recently attempted to enter Saudi territory to the north west of Najran with the intention of cutting off the steady supply of arms and nnuiitions which were coming to them from Saudi tribes notably the Qahtan. The latter had refused to allow the Imam f s troops to cross the border without the express orders of Bin Saud. Saif al Islam Ahmad had explained that he would accept all responsibility but the Qahtan were adamant. The tribes of Najran, the writer added, t t- possession of Saudi name, and which ies suspicious. (b) (c) Muiacliai and The Al Adrisi has sent a fresh deputation to Sana T a for what was not known. ter- purpose was not k e Jizan authorities (Saudi) were bus repairing the old forts which are scat ed over the country and were^ building &lt; many new ones. Work was going on hurriedly and much military activity was evident. Some 3,600 men with guns had reached Jizn between 8th and 27th of July. Ihese had been sent down by the Hijaz Government by land and sea. (d) Munitions and foodstuffs were being collected in large quantities at Jizan. (e) The Saudi Grovernment was everywhere reported to be supporting the tribes of Nairan openlv witn arms and ammunition, which had caused deep resentment among the people of Yemen. Heavy fighting was going on there between the Yemen iroops and the Bani Yam tribe. ff) The Imam had issued orders for reinforcements of troops to be sent to the Al Mahmiat country.-6 - (g) The strictest censorship was being maintained by the Saudi authorities in Asir and all along the coast. ihe Shaikh of Kuwait while very cautious about giving an opinion is inclined to think that the King possibly intends as soon as the weather turns cold to strike down the Tiharaa at Hodeida, while keeping the Yemen armies occupied in the direction of Najran, where Bin Saud seems to have managed to start a wide conflagration. This seems rather a far fetched view seeing that a hostile Asir would be left in the army^ rear. On the other hand Bin Saud may be tempted to risk a southern campaign if only for the sake of diverting the minds of his great tribes from their moody and sullen hostility to himself. The King knows that there is nothing like a war with promise of loot to remove dissatisfaction. He would do well, however, not to ask his northern tribesmen to go as far south as Asir again. They simply would not go. They had such a miserable time when they went last winter, what with disease and privation that nothing short of force will make them undertake the long drawn journey again. A curious rumour reached Kuwait on 31st July that Bin Saud had suddenly gone blind in his second eye and that Dr. Dame from Bahrain had not really gone to attend one of his wives but the King himself. Obviously this is a canard spread by those who have no liking for his Majesty. A certain respectable Buraida merchant whose name need not be given arrived in Kuwait at the end of July. Among other things he told the Shaikh that one of the bad signs of the times and a thing which was offending the Najd world grievously was the growing immorality that was to be observed at the King’s Court. He quoted the following two instances which he swore to be true:-- 7 - luu (a) That one of the Kin^s sons had misbehaved himself recently with one of his father's own wives. (b) That enother son had done the same thing with the King's sister (his aunt). This cheerful personage also told harrowing tales of how with the introduction of motor convoys from Mecca to Biath, and the wiping away of distances, 'Syphilis” had got right among the Central Arabian Bedouins, and was making terrible havoc among them. How far the story is anti-Bin Saud propaganda, I cannot say. There is evidence to show however from the number of cases that come in for treatment that venereal disease is on the increase among the tribes of Najd. I have this on the authority of the Mission Hospital doctors.coMifiiamTiAi.. 0 I v Ho,?. 182-H/33.

His Majesty appeared to be in good form and was as affable as usual. I presented Mr. Calvert. 2. Following on general conversation of the usual anodyne character, the ivmg observed that the autumn was his busy time in Nejd, as it was there that the leading people flocked about him, each expecting the personal attention of the Sovereign. He went on to say that within a year to two his son Saud might be trained enough to relieve him of this burden. I took the opportunity of con gratulating His Majesty in person on the action he had so wisely taken to provide for the future of the throne. The King, in thanking me, stressed the fact that he had not taken the initiative, but yielded to the appeals of his people. 3. The King s remark about the Amir Saud derives some significance from a report which reached me on the 3rd June in a form too uncertain to be worth reporting at the time, that the King was contemplating abdication and was only waiting for the return of the mission he had sent to the Yemen. Without wishing to exaggerate the probability of such an event at some not too distant date, I think that it should be borne in mind as a possibility. To an European, it may seem unlikely that a man of 53 with Ibn Saud s past should contemplate such a step at the height of his achievement. I am not sure, however, that it would be alien to his character to retire in favour of the son. whom he has so spectacularly installed as Heir Apparent, hoping perhaps to guide the steps of his successor during the remainder of his own life. It is nearly three years since Fuad Bey spoke to me of the King's desire to reduce his burden of responsibility, and “ to reign rather than to rule.' This forecast proved false, but there have been faint indications of a slow movement in that direction. Ibn Saud has tended to lead a somewhat easier life than of old. He has left more in the hands of his advisers, though he still controls them all in major matters. He has accepted now consti tutional forms, which, though they appear to us rather illusory at present, are not wholly unreal. Last year he made new secretarial arrangements at Riyadh, which involved the transfer to the Amir Saud of his own chief secretary, Ibrahim- ibn-Muammar, who has now gone as Charge d’Affaires to Bagdad. 4. I collect these indications for two reasons. Slight as they are, they lend support to the idea that Ibn Saud may end his active career, or at any rate his public career, by abdication rather than by death. Secondly, and this is of more interest to His Majesty's Government, such an intention would help to explain the rather marked tendency which Ibn Saud has shown during the past year to seek to compose various differences which might militate against the success of a new ruler; to disarm hostility among his own subjects; arid to reduce the possi bilities of quarrel with neighbouring countries like Iraq, Transjordan, the Yemen, and perhaps even Koweit. 5. I sought a further audience with the King on the 11th June to discuss business. I will report what passed separately in connexion with the subjects I raised, in so far as it may be necessary to record it. The King broached no subject of his own. 6. Ibn Saud returned to Mecca late on the 12th June. During his short stay, His Majesty gave a great deal of time to Captain H. C. Armstrong, who is writing his biography and whom he consented, as a result of correspondence through the Saudi Minister in London, to receive in Jedda. Captain Armstrong [851 d—1]arrived on the 7th June. He had a general conversation with the King on the 10th June and had four further audiences on the 11th and 12th June of an average duration of some two hours each. The King has been most forthcoming, and both parties appear to be exceedingly pleased with each other. I have avoided any appearance of promoting C aptain Armstrongs enterpiise, but he is staying with my wife and me on the strength of old friendship. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to his Excellency the Viceroy India (Foreign and Political Department), His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad His Majesty's High Commissioners at Jerusalem and Cairo, the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and to His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner at Aden.

It is easy money for the Government as the shipping companies include the dues in the cost of the tickets, tut the Government have shown no readiness to assign any revenue, whether o us toms or quarantine dues or other to the service of a loan, as for an unsecured loan, there are philanthropists like the ex-Khedive of 2 lgypt etc. , who seem ready to produce or promise money without obvious inducement; but I doubt whether they include Germans. The German trading Consul here told me last year that, when the Sa'&amp;dl mission tried to get money in various capitals, Berlin was one; and he laughed. He is now away for an Indefinite period. All the same, if you hear anything more on the subject, it would interest me to have it. . I am sending a copy of this to aendel. (Signed) Yours sincerely, Andrew iyan. G.‘.s. Ggilvie-Forbes jsq.

SINCE I wrote my despatch No. 33 1 o f the 2nd August last incidental reference only has been made in reports^ frorn this Legation to M. van Leeuwen. the Dutch expert who entered the service of the Saudi Government in April 1932 as financial adviser. I have now to record his final departure from Jedda on the 18th May. 2. M. van Leeuwen returned from sick leave in or about October last. This leave interrupted what was to have been a year of continuous service, to be followed by a period of leave on full pay before his contract finally expired. I believe it was agreed that he should draw no salary for the period of his absence last year, and should make up for the time lost by serving for an additional three months at the end of the vear originally contemplated. 3. Unfortunatelv M. van Leeuwen’s health has continued to be precarious. He has had several bouts of illness during the spring, and this has been the immediate cause of his leaving for good. It must be attributed in part, however, to the hopelessness of his position in the Administration here. I do not thniK that he has at any time been allowed to do more than write academic reports, and it has been increasingly evident of late that he could play no effective ^^l® ^ ^ department dominated by the personality and methods of Sheikh Abdullah Suleima were not i m p rove( | by M. van Leeuwen’s condemnation of the National Bank scheme projected by the ex-Khedive and his associates.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 69 of the 28th February, I have the honour to submit a few further items of information regarding the ex-Khedive’s scheme for a national bank in this country. 2. Abdul Hamid Shed id did not get away on the 1st March as he had intended, owing to delay over the forwarding of the King’s final decision. There appears to have been no serious hitch, but an eleventh-hour attempt to dissuade I bn Saud was made by certain merchants, whose spokesman, young Hussein Aweyni, made a fruitless journey to Riyadh. The Dutch Financial Adviser has also shown himself very hostile to the scheme, but I do not think that his opinion counted for anything. It is probable that M. van Leeuwen’s dislike of the project is quite honest, but it is possible that it may be accentuated by sympathy with the Netherlands Trading Society. 3. Abdul Hamid Shedid finally left on the 10th March. He gave me to understand after dinner at Mr. Philby’s house on the previous evening that his agreement with the Saudi Government was quite definite and that it only remained to organise the bank. He explained that it would not confine itself to the Hejaz—1 million, he said, was too much for this country—but would operate in other Near Eastern countries and would have its headquarters in London, where he himself will be managing director. It is now pretty generally known that Mr. Philby is likely to be the conseiller of the bank in this country, but I would ask you to regard this information as strictly confidential until it reaches you from other sources, as my most definite information was confided to me in a very personal conversation by Mr. Philby himself. 4. The Um?n-al-Qura of the 17th March announced the conclusion of the agreement and promised full particulars as soon as it should have come into force. Nothing further was published up to the 30th March, the date of the last issue I have seen. 5. I know nothing about the latest plans of the promoters of the bank. The delay in Abdul Hamid Shedid’s departure destroyed any prospect of rushing the matter through in time to start business here on the 1st April. I have, &amp;c.

Jedda, April 13, 1933. ’ IN paragraph 32 of the Jedda report for March, enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of the 7th April, I mentioned that Ibn Sand had given a dinner to notable ‘ pilgrims on the evening of the 31st March. As you are aware, this is now a regular feature of each year’s pilgrimage season. On the present occasion, the King entertained some hundreds of guests of various nationalities, including several Indians. I understand from my Indian vice-consul that the attention shown both to Shia and to Indian pilgrims has been a feature of this year’s pilgrimage. In the case of the Indians the King and the Minister of Finance, who is largely responsible for dispensing such attention, had the advantage of the presence of Jemal Pasha Ghazzi, who has been conducting since last year an intensive pro-pilgrimage campaign in India and was able to make play with the intimacy he had established there with various participants in this 2. It is the King’s custom to speak at great length at these annual banquets. The published version of his address on the present occasion occupied a page and a half of the Umm-al-Qura of the 6th April. I enclose a short summary prepared in the Legation. . . T i u * 3. The King preached from his usual text, the need for unity in Islam, hut he seems to have restrained almost entirely the tendency which he has sometimes shown in the past to give offence by his utterances regarding people who do not share his views. I understand that the published version of his speech represents the original pretty accurately, although the actual language used m certain passages may have been more emphatic. I have heard only one e ^ e of any important omission. According to my Persian coHeagues the King gave as one of the reasons why he could not aspire to the Caliphate the fact that ^ many Moslem countries are under alien denomination. He m said to h av e mdud in the number Egypt as being under the thumb of Great Britain It he really said this, it cannot have been pleasing to all his Egyptian hearers, though it might grat 4 y Tam^ndmg copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department) to His Majesty s Ambassador at Bagdad' and to His Majesty’s High Comnnssmners for Egypt and Transjordan. 1 ^ &amp;c ANDREW RYAN.

WITH reference to paragraph 32 of the Jedda report enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of the 7th April, I have the honour to state that Ibn Sand arrived in Jedda early yesterday and gave the usual series of formal audiences to the heads of foreign missions in the forenoon. He is staying at a large house which has recently been built by the Minister of Finance about a mile outside the town. It is already rumoured that the so-called “ Green Palace ” is to be turned into a hotel. Be this as it may, it is interesting to note the tightening of the connexion between His Majesty and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who spends but little time in Jedda and may have built his new house partly with a view to his master’s convenience. 2. I found the King affable, but he did not appear to be in the same good form as when I last saw him at the end of last August; I cannot say that he looked ill, but he gave the impression of suffering from nervous worry. He seemed distrait, and I had to initiate almost every subject of conversation. The nature of the audience required that the topics should be general. We discoursed of our respective states of health, the excellent rains that have fallen in Nejd, the virtues of water and the broader aspects of the recent pilgrimage. The most striking feature of this last part of the conversation was the King’s eagerness to assure me of his readiness to entertain suggestions for the betterment of pilgrimage conditions. He repeated this assurance at least twice. 3. Mr. Furlonge, who was with me, agrees generally with my impression of the King’s physical state. He had not seen His Majesty for nearly two years and would not like to express himself too confidently, but he thought that Ibn Saud presented the appearance of having aged considerably. 4. The King’s plans appear to be uncertain. If I should have any conversation with him of an important nature during his stay in Jedda, I will report separately. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan, to the honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to His Majesty s Chief Commissioner at Aden.

Go far as official circles in the Eejaz are concerned, silence had for some time brooded over the i^ank proposal* They have, I think, been a little perturbed at receiving no news as to the progress made by ’Abdul Hamid Shedfd since he left on April 10th with his concession in his pocket and, I m now assured, a small sum of cash down for expenses. Tnia has doubtless made Ibn Ha , ud and his entourage all Tine more sensitive regarding two misconstructions alleged to have been placed on Mr. Philby’s articlw in the translation published by the Abram newspaper of Cairo* -^he ^ihraia version had, according to people here, laid the ^a'udi Government open to the accusations/ Night Honourable, 3 lr dohn ^imon, G.C.S.I*, K*C.V.O*, etc., etc., etc.accusation* of haying sold themselve* to a group intending to create not a State flank, an ✓ hilty called tt, hut an -international- hank and of having mortgaged their cue tone revenue. Both accusation : - e rep!;alated in 8 lon a “ad indignant leading article in the »Taa al-^ura of May 12th and the second was categwically denied in an official comauniqud of May 11th, published in the same issue of the Umm-al- .ura.

The most interesting points in it are the stress -Laid on the importance of the distinction between a state bank and an international bank, an explanation of the methods hitherto used to pay oxf debts and the use of drafts on customs in that connexion and a rather weaker attempt to rebut the suggestion that the adoption of the Bank proposal means countenancing usury, la claimed that the Government have paid off more than half their debts in the last two years and the hope is expressed that, if some of the economic projects now in view materialize, the remainder will be settled shortly. 4. All this may amount to little more than a passing storm in in a teacup but X have thought it worth recording as a sidelight on a curiously uncertain situation in regard to the proposed bank and the hopes that hang so largely, though not exclusively, on the prospect of its being started. 5. x am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the department of Overseas Trade, £he Government of India, Ills Majesty’s iigh bQjaiaisgXoner for ^gypt and to the High Oosuaissioner for Transjordan.

Section 3 JT [E 1491/234/25] No. 1. z/ Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 21.) (No. 69. Very Confidential.) Sir, Jed da, February 28, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 30 of the 21st .January relative to the arrival in this country of Abdul Hamid Shedid, an agent of the ex-Khedive of Egypt, I have the honour to state that this gentleman appears to have made considerable progress with his negotiations with the Saudi Government, and is understood to be leaving Jedda to-morrow to report to Abbas Hilmi Pasha. 2. I am credibly informed that an agreement has been reached, ad referendum, in the case of the ex-Khedive’s representative, and, perhaps, in that of the Saudi negotiators also, for the creation of a national bank here with a capital of £1 million gold. It is stated that the ex-Khedive will provide half this amount, that the Saudi Government will be technically entitled to subscribe £250,000, and that the remainder will be offered for public subscription in the Hejaz. It is suggested that the Saudi Government will not, in fact, subscribe, and that the ex-Khedive has in view another source for the £250,000 which they are entitled to put up. It is further stated that the promoters will lend the Govern ment £200,000. The bank will operate as the State bank, receiving all revenue collected by the Government. It will be authorised to issue notes, but it is not clear that these notes will be brought into compulsory use at the outset. 3. I cannot discover what, if any, economic concessions have been promised to the ex-Khedive. It may be noted in this connexion that the Saudi Government appear to be in negotiation with other interests regarding concessions, notably for the exploitation of oil and gold. In these circumstances I am greatly at a j loss to understand where Abbas Hilmi Pasha and his associates hope to make their profit. It has been suggested that, if they can get favourable terms regarding cover for note issue and succeed in bringing the issue into general use (which can hardly be done without making the notes the only legal currency in the near future), they may hope to draw substantial quantities of gold and silver out of the country. This might be a profitable once-for-all transaction, but it seems inadequate as a basis for permanent business. As for ordinary banking business, I imagine that it will be uphill work to develop it on a profitable scale, even with the support of the Government, in competition with the Netherlands Trading Society and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., both of whom do regulai banking and have extensive foreign connexions, as well as with the numerous local films, who do banking of a sort on their own account as a side-line. 4. The enterprise looks on the face of it so dubious as finance that one is fr» lr»nlr ■Pnr nnlitinal motives on the part of tne ex-Khedive. I confess the near future, it will have to be made public.2 7. I may advert in this connexion to one matter on which I have too I ni information to make it the subject of a separate report. There has been m K gossip of late about the possibility of the Nizam of Hyderabad comine t Ibn Saud’s assistance in consideration of his being allowed to recondition th Prophet’s Birthplace at Mecca. In my despatch under reference I mentioned th greater readiness of Abdul Hamid Shedid to talk to my French colleague abo t the Nizam than about his own business. It is conceivable that the ex-Khedi may hope to bring the Nizam into his combine (see the reference to “ anoth 76 source ” in paragraph 2 above), but this is a matter of pure speculation. The oih ^ facts I can adduce are that there appears to be increasing interest in the He' ^ in Hyderabadi circles, and that the interest of the Nizam in the PronheP Birthplace is fairly well vouched for. There is, however, nothing in these fact 8 in themselves to suggest the Nizam's possible participation in the ex-Khedive' S scheme, rather than a separate deal between the Nizam and Ibn Saud. 8.

My French colleague, who came in the same steamer, tells me that ’Abdul Hamid Shedia said he was coming in response to an invitation from the Xing. He went out of his way to get into conversation with M. Maigret but was readier to talk of the question whether the King might not look to the Nizam of Hyderabad for assistance than to disclose the object of his own mission. 3.

AVL the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a g-eneral memorandum on Government indebtedness which the Saudi Arab Government has cnciliated to various commercial firms here, and which the Minister for note-— Affairs has com municated to me under the following brief covering toX^ulhoSieraed^'^ y ° U be g0 ° d en ° Ugh t0 translnit il I have not replied. iV/To • 2 f discourtes y implicit in this off-hand manner of treating with His yW and the Government of India, in their capacity as creditors ?L h n S i d r Arab G o ve ™ment occupying a special position, is only equalled bv the unsatisfactory nature of the memorandum itself. It is an obscure and probably dishonest, document, which states, in effect, that it has only been found possible m the closing financial year to pay off some 14 million piastres-worth— whether gold or silver piastres is not clear—of indebtedness bv means of drafts on customs, and to provide for a payment of 5 per cent, interest on the rest ^Gcm 1 of the memorandum refers to the Royal proclamation piomul^ated la,st November a translation of which was transmitted to you in my despatch No 444 of the 17th November. 1931. There, it will be remembered Ibn baud established two principles : That of the apportioning of all revenues under four heads, one of them the redemption of debt, and that of the equal treatment ol all creditors. Reference is made in the present memorandum to the first principle; the second is conveniently ignored. i 4; Ar ^ c . le 2 quotes extenuating circumstances by way of preparation to explaining tailure. Article 3 explains awav, without admitting it, the principle of equality of treatment. f F Ha - The Arablc of art icle 4 has proved extremely difficult to translate; now tnat it is accurately translated it is well-nigh unintelligible. I take it to mean roughly that the Government have issued drafts on customs to a value of some 14 nnihon piastres, whether silver or gold I know not—probably a mixture of both, and that this amount accounts for the greater part of the income from revenue apportioned to^debt redemption; a small balance being left with which to meet the interest at 5 per cent, on other debts announced in article 6. I cannot under stand the import of the reference to the fall in silver values in this connexion (the silver riyal, though still officially at 10 to the gold pound, has subsided during the lunar year ending to-day from 17^ to the gold pound to nearly 20 to the gold P, ouad )- it is intended to convey the impression that, owing to the fall in silver the Government have had to redeem debt at higher rates than they had estimated, the argument is meretricious, for its only rational sense could be that, if, instead or issuing drafts on customs in the early part of the year in payment of silver (t.e., internal) debt, they had issued them at the end of the year, they would have saved money and made it go further; as who should plead in bankruptcy in k ranee that, if only he had paid his sterling creditors at the end of 1931. instead of as and when he received their third and final applications (threatening legal proceedings), he would not be where he is. 6. I cannot extract any other reasonable meaning from article 4, which does not conflict with the known facts that all Government revenue is collected on a gold basis, that the external debt is mostly redeemable in gold and the [655 n—1]2 internal mostly in silver, and that the budget estimate of 16| million piastres has a gold figure equalling £150,000 (see Fuad Bey Hamza’s statement, reported in paragraph 4 of Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 36 of the 21st January last). 7. There is also more than meets the eye in the liquidation of drafts on customs. Large numbers of these are extant, and those which have been issued &gt; to Government employees in lieu of arrears of salary (see Sir Andrew Rvan’s despatch No. 298 of the 12th July) are now changing hands at 30 per cent, of their face value. A month ago they stood on the market at 34 per cent. 8. The whole financial position is so unsatisfactory, and any explanation of obscurities, where all is obscure, would be of so little avail, even, if it were forthcoming, that I have not thought it worth while to question the Saudi Arab Government on these and other points. The moment, moreover, is not propitious, with the rebellion in Asir in full swing. Should Sir Andrew Ryan not already have your instructions as to the treatment of these questions of Government indebtedness when he returns next month. I have the honour to enquire what action you would wish taken, in view of the enclosed memorandum, in regard to both the capital sums outstanding and the interest now offered. 9. I should add that the Dutch financial adviser returned to Jedda on the 6th November. He was not consulted in any particular regarding this memorandum, which was, in fact, issued a few days prior to his return, and has not yet been communicated to him by the Finance Ministry. 10. I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosure to his Excellency the Viceroy of India. I have. &amp;e. C. G. HOPE GILL Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. (Translation.) THE Government of His Majesty the King have taken great care concerning the debts due by them, and His Majesty the King and his Government have paid special attention to a search for the best means for reaching a settlement of the question of these debts in-a manner which meets both the ability of the Treasury to pay and the confidence of creditors. As a result of careful search made last year. His Majesty the King was pleased to issue orders for a precise arrangement to be made in regard to the Government Treasury, causing the estimated income to be divided into different parts, of which one part was assigned for the reim bursement and settlement of these debts. 2. It is not unknown that the fact which caused the Government to adopt this procedure was the financial strain prevailing all over the world and the shortage of revenue of all Governments, caused by the irresistible crisis which entangled economic affairs and confused and paralysed financial matters. There is no need to ghe proof of what the Governments of the world have suffered in general as a result ot this dreadtul crisis, as this is known to everybody. When the Govern ment made their decision last year, namely, to postpone the settlement of debts loi one year, ending the 10th of the month of November, 1932. they took the most hopeful \lew of the matter and felt optimistic that the beginning of the end of t e crisis was coming, that the estimate made by the Government for their annual n mi ©ht be realised in full and the Government would thus be able to settle a claiom due by their Treasury; but unfortunately the situation did not improve during last year and Governments and nations continued to suffer from the strain, anxiety and confusion in financial and economic affairs It has become the duty of the treasury m every kingdom to take new effective measures for fighting the crisis and parrying its dangers on the one hand, and for meeting the claims ol creditors on the other. &amp; 3. The Treasury, in dealing with creditors, has followed a course in which e necessities of the economic situation were taken into consideration. It was based on helping any creditors who might choose to have the debt due to them liquidated by means of deductions to be allowed from the original amounts of dutie* payable on goods imported into the country. Although we admit that this method could not be made applicable to all cases of creditors, the Government(Seal) Ministry for Foreign Affairs. found it inevitable to follow this method. It was eventually established that the method was not a bad one and that it helped not a small number of creditors to have the whole or part of their debts reimbursed. s t0 4. When the final account was made up after eleven months of the arrano-e. ffent introduced by Royal order regarding the division of the estimated Treasury revenues it was found that most of the item debts chest, mentioned therein (as enving) from the capital value of the estimated revenues, had been discharged in meeting the drafts on customs which had been given to creditors. That tern si ghtly exceeded 14 million min piastres, and in view of the falling valuesTf silver com the net gold value of the item debts diminished by 50 per lent of its value estimated in the budget. This item equalled the amounts appropriated to creditors by the drafts on customs. ^ F 5. When the Government found that they would not be able to settle all debts due from them, as had been expected, they made all possible endeavour to obtain such amount as would suffice for the payment of their debts, but they have not succeeded in finding the desired solution. The Government was therefore bound to advise creditors before the time fixed for payment of the fact that it was beyond the ability of the Government to pay the amounts which were expected to be paid out of revenue, and in view of this fact they wish to explain the matter to those whom it concerns, showing, meanwhile, the precautions which were taken to avoid this state of affairs, but which have failed. 6. As a result of their endeavours, the Government have succeeded in obtaining a sum which enables them to pay 5 per cent, in respect of profit (interest) for last year only; this sum is ready on demand and will be paid to those concerned shortly. It is hoped that the Government will succeed during next year in settling the whole, or the greater part, of these debts, subject, as mentioned above, to the state of the revenues improving generally. 7. In conclusion, the Government of His Majesty wish to express their regret for being obliged to follow this course, which they would have preferred to avoid, following another had there been no such general distress, and they trust that creditors will remain confident of their definite intention to take every action that may lead to the complete settlement of these debts. They assure them of their true desire to do so.cX&gt; III uny furtlier nommiiniratiun on this subjer-t, jileiise quote Xo - t \ and address —not to any person by name, but to— Tbe Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Ofliee, London, S.W.

Mr. Hoye Gill to Sir John Simon—{Received November 25.) (No. 428.) Sir, ’ ttji? r i i , Je.dda. October 19, 1932. manager of the local Dutch Bank,' a branch of the Handel Maatschappij of Amsterdam, has imparted the following items of financial interest:— 2. During the months of May. June, July and August his office was busily employed in selling to about a dozen of the smaller merchants of Jedda and Mecca, against gold, drafts on Bombay, Cairo and London. They amounted, in round figures, to £150,000 sterling, and were divided about equally between those three markets. Mr. Jacobs was of the opinion that the drafts on Bombay were required to finance purchases of rice and other comestibles in time for the coming pilgrimage season, that those on London were mainly for the purchase of cotton goods, and that those on Cairo were connected with gambling on the gold exchange. He made a point of stating that these figures excluded the business preparations made by the really big local firms, such as Haji Abdullah 'Ali Ridha's, who conduct their own banking business. Nor, he thought, did they include savings of the more fortunate Government servants placed abroad for greater safety. 3. If Mr. Jacobs's figures are approximately correct, as I take them to be, they show that there was evidently still plenty of money in private hands; at the same time they betray an implicit faith in the size of the next pilgrimage, which seems only too likely to have been misplaced. A couple of months ago the bazaar gossip placed the coming Javanese pilgrimage with confidence at 40,000. Last season it was 4,500. Next season, according to the shipping company, which has reason to know best, it will be 1,500. Stocks are now heavy, and unless other countries send unsuspected quantities of pilgrims, it will be very difficult to get rid of the accumulation. 4. Mr. Jacobs was very despondent about Saudi Government finance. During next month, he said, Government commitments mature to the tune of £40,000 gold. He will have to handle these debts, but sees no hope of obtaining payment. On the contrary, he foresees trouble and complications arising from the fact that the greater portion of them has been discounted and re-discounted in Europe. This, I understand, to be the case with £15,000 owing to the Standard Oil Company through Messrs. Sharqieh (Limited), and £10,000 to German firms represented by M. de Haas, the German consul; these are Mr. Jacobs’s figures. The other £15,000 are owing to the Marconi Company, also through Messrs. Sharqieh. Apart from these, Mr. Jacobs is aware of £5,000 gold ov ing to his own firm, £15,000 to the Shell Company, through Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., £25,000 to the Qusaibis, and £30,000 to the Soviets for oil—a total external indebtedness, according to Mr. Jacobs, of £llo,000 gold. To this figure we can add £10.0 0 0 owiij g^to the Go vernm ent of India, £2,500 to the Eastern Telegraph Company, and £1,700 t&lt;T His Majesty s Go\ernment^ a minimum grand total of some £125,000 gold. • t rr v 5. Mr. Jacobs is convinced that there is no money left in the Treasury, the recent rebellion having cost Ibn Saud at least £40.000, he thinks, and used up his reserves. The Saudi Government have nevertheless recently scraped together the following sums for export: £1,500 and £1,300 for an Isotto-Frascmm ear apiece for the King and the Viceroy, and a few T hundred pounds to induce M. van Leeuwen to return from sick leave to his unfinished duties of financial 6.

This is my principle, and I pray God mav grant me success in the future also. You will therefore see that I am in the e 1 vlc ™ 1 ^. position of peace and friendship with the Governments neighbourinD 1 on the Heiaz-Nejd and its dependencies.” 3. The third question refers to the Arab Conference at Jerusalem and to another which is expected to be held shortly (presumably that at Bagdad) and asks what His Majesty thinks of them, in view of the fact that his countrv compnses the greater part of the Arabian Peninsula, and that its geographical, religious, historical, linguistic and political qualifications entitle its inhabitants to play a leading role. The answer is evasive and anodyne : “ You are aware that my first task is to follow the ancestors, to ensure that everyone receives his ricrht, to render people of all classes comfortable, to establish peace, to improve ^the condition of the country, and to make the regulations necessary for its administra tion. As regards the position of my countries towards the neighbouring Govern ments, this matter concerns me as well as the Arabs, who undoubtedly will not remain far from each other for ever. I think that their inclination to hold one conference after another is the result of the firm belief, which has penetrated deeply into their blood, that they have to co-operate and work hand in hand for the restitution of the honour of Islam, and to behave as good and useful members of human society as their grandfathers did, for the leading of the people to laws, knowledge, the arts and everything to their advantage. This is their natural right and none can blame them for it. The Arab Conference which was held some months ago was due to the necessity of creating understanding between the Arabs, and I hope that the discussions and objects of the next Arab Conference and the wishes of its members will be united and free from the personal and material interests which have hitherto prevented Arabs from co-operating and uniting.” 4. Asked finally what the chances of success of the next Arab Conference are and whether, if invited to join an Arab Alliance, he would accept, Ibn Sand 18 as discreet as he is pious. The future is in God’s hands, he replies, but if, he [599 m—1]HO*371* (3&amp;59/2&amp;6/16), IO &lt;o m AUgU0t 27th, 1982* Av Sir, » X have the honour to forward herewith • tranolotlon of an announowaont puoliahad in the local press on Minuet as to the effect that the Department of .Inanee had been raised to the statue of a -aafirat, with Shay5th Abdullah Suleyman as vasfr and his brother Hamad as Wakfl* X will deal elsewhere in due course with the political significance of this change* In the present despatch X confine myself in the main to its constitutional aspect* 3.

Sir ’ wtttt t . ivr rr J edda, July \% V$&amp;1. WITH reference to Mr. Hope Gill s despatch No. 140 of the 20th March and previous correspondence relative to the financial situation of this country I “n™ he i n° n0Ur &gt; t0 ^ fo i &gt;wa ^ a translation of a regulation published in the Umm-al-Qui a of the 17th June, regarding the mode of settlement of o. J r’T^u deh . f \ The W 0 f dl p n s of the regulation is in some respects obscure, ana 1 snould not like to vouch for the complete accuracy of the translation. The piinciple appears to be that all debts (meaning, presumably, debts dating from betore the current financial year, although this is not stated) will, except as provided in articles 1, 2, 5 and 6, be paid by drafts on customs, where such drafts have not already been issued in respect of them, and that such drafts will be accepted in payment of 25 per cent, of the duty on newly-imported goods. Claimants who are not themselves importing merchants are*to nominate such merchants in whose name the drafts will be issued. I understand that, as might be expected, the market for drafts on customs is very poor, but it is too soon &amp; to judge of the practical effect of the regulation. „ . 2 \ I re P ort ed elsewhere on a representation made to me by the Acting Heiazi Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the discouraging advice alleged vjru- een &amp; iven b y Majesty's Government to the business friends of a M. Ydhbi, who is interested in enterprise in this country. I suggested, in this connexion, to 8&gt;heikh \ ussuf \asin that the Hejazi Government were themselves destroying any credit they might have. This led the sheikh to give me on the 26th June his general views about the financial situation. He spoke of the poverty of the Hejaz and the conditions in other countries, referring, inter alia, to the loss imposed on so many people by Great Britain’s abandonment of the gold standard. 3. I explained to Sheikh Yussuf at some length that what I complained of was not the effects of the poverty of the Hejaz, which might well necessitate special arrangements with creditors, but the financial methods employed, which were such that no creditor knew where he stood. I had not, I said, pressed him on the subject of claims in which His Majesty’s Government were interested, because we had been absorbed in the Transjordan frontier, but I ran him through the list in order to illustrate my thesis. It had been announced last autumn that one-fourth of the whole revenue would be assigned to the payment of old debts, and I had in January given Sheikh Fuad Hamza my views as to how the Government might be expected to deal with the floating debt problem. The arrangement of last autumn seemed to have been lost sight of, and there was now a new regulation which I did not quite understand, but which seemed to produce certain definite effects. 4. I told Sheikh Yussuf that article 1 of the new regulation seemed to me to be a grand arrangement for creditors who had special arrangements. I expected to hear at any moment that Egyptian Shell had been paid the amounts due for the benzine which the Government had acquired in peculiar circumstances last September, and in respect of which the Director-General of Finance had made and then dishonoured a special agreement. 1 was interested, however, in other claims, about which no special arrangements had been made. I gave, as one example, the small sum due to His Majesty’s Government for the Hejazi share in the expenditure on the MacDonnell investigation. Was it really intended, I asked, that I should take out drafts on customs and get a local importing merchant to discount them for me ? The sheikh replied in a rather shocked tone that the regulation did not apply to the case in point. I referred also to a subject on which I had spoken to him on the 12th June, but with which I have not felt it necessary to trouble you, namely, the action (successful in some cases) of the [542 s—2]2 Directorate-General of Finance in trying to get chauffeurs employed in Govern ment wntrolled motor companies to accept one-third of the arrears due to them in full se “ f le ^® n g e ; azi Government would only adopt some sensible method of dealing with the floating debt on a moratorium basis and stick to it I should not be so hard on them. As it is, the prospects of creditors are pretty desperate. , v , -t* oifnation ptows easier. I may be able, before going Majesty oases as may be necessary. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from “ Umm-al-Qura of Safar 12, 1351 (June 1/, 1932). 3^^ Decision in respect of Debts. ^ THE following has been received from the Press Department: The Ministry of Finance makes the following declaration regarding debts due by the Government: — 1. Debts concerning which an arrangement has already been reached with the creditors will be dealt with in accordance with that agi eement. 2. With regard to debts in respect of which the Directorate of finance has given to the creditors drafts on the customs, 25 per cent, of the customs revenue will be set aside for the creditors in payment of the amount due to them, these drafts will remain valid as issued. 3. With regard to debts in respect of which the creditors do not hold draits of the customs, the Directorate of Finance is prepared to give to the creditors in person drafts in payment, so that the drafts may be set oft against t e cus ms duty payable by the creditor at the rate of 25 per cent. , ^ 4. Every Government employee whose salary is in arrear may take a dra on the customs, as may any merchant who does not import goods thioug e customs. Such an employee or such a merchant must make an agreement wi another merchant (presumably one of those w T ho do import goods) and his name to the Government, whereupon a draft will be given to the sp 6 ? 1 merchant in respect of the amount due to the (original) merchant, which wi set off against the customs duty payable by him (the specified merchant.) a rate of 25 per cent. The said merchant (No. 2 ?) is not allowed to sell the ra to another person. , 5. In the case of soldiers, police and chauffeurs in the Government em P ^ ment, who are still in that employment, the Government will give them, in res P of their arrears of pay, supplies in kind—a suitable quantity for each men until all their claims are liquidated. This is in addition to the salaries w will be paid to them and to all other employees. . , i j- 6. Debts due by the Government in respect of house rent will be set „ j\ ise accordance with the special regulation in respect of delayed payments ol rent.2 / . likely to be intensified by the appointment as head of police of an arrogant offici I who held a similar post at Rabigh. This man, Syed Kurdi, is believed to com from Ras-al-Ain, near Aleppo. The town is said to be full of spies. Eventh innocent-looking and in itself legitimate census excites mistrust. Apart fron the common oriental fear that it is a prelude to conscription or taxation, there r j widespread doubt as to whether it is safer to declare oneself a Hejazi and put^ 1 oneself at the mercy of the Government, or to claim foreign nationality and risk' (their vindictiveness.

The vice-consul saw personally a certain Sheikh Abdullah Jefali, who played a role in the last war in the Dejaz mainly, I gather, on the commissariat side. This person was expecting e sent to Medina. The Amir Neshmi, who has apparently been in these parts is said to have been despatched with a force to Wejh. What with these movements and the turn out of tribal forces from the regions of Hail Jauf &amp;c £ nnn V1Ce ' COnS ? D 8 ; nf °rmants estimated that Ibn Saud was mobilising at ’least a,UUU men, with the object of inflicting a crushing defeat on the present rebels and giving a salutary lesson to all and sundry. arrest of Faudhi-al-Kawokji seems to have created no small sensation. It is undoubtedly connected with the Ibn Rifada affair as an immediate cause, but it has its own background of rumour. It is suggested GO that the Amir Feisal had incurred the King’s displeasure before he left for -urope (compare Mr. Hope Gill's telegram No. 56 of the 8th May); (5) that there is a split among the influential Syrians, and notably a great enmity between luad Bey Hamza and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, owing to an intrigue between the tormer and the wife of the latter; (c) that Faudhi is a protege of the Amir Feisal; and (a) that Yusuf Yasin took advantage of the absence of the Amir and Fuad to procure Faudhi’s arrest on receipt of the news about Ibn Rifada. There is said to be yet another lady in the case in the person of the Amir’s latest wife, who is described as being a woman of Nejdi and Turkish parentage, born and educated m Constantinople, strong-minded, and determined to make a man of the Amir, who is alleged to be much under her influence and to have agreed to discard his other wives in her favour. Finally, there was talk in Mecca and Taif of other arrests besides that of Faudhi. but of these I have no particulars. [516 n—1]6. Most of the preceding paragraph must be regarded as doubtful, but it is not quite such small beer as might appear at first sight. 1 am assured that, whatever the reason, Fuad Hamza and Yusuf lasin are seriously at loggerheads, and any quarrel between these two is a quarrel between an ambitious moderniser and one who is out and out the King’s man. It is not impossible that the Amir Feisal, a man of no great character but some intelligence, swollen perhaps with the vanity of having been Viceroy of the Hejaz, might become the stalking horse of a party formed to pull the Hejaz out of the morass in which the King’s attempts at administration and economic depression have landed it. The report that all is not well betw^een the Amir and the King deserves some support from the fact that he expected to be detained at Riyadh on his return from his tour, an expectation which he is said to have announced to his friends before he left, and w'hich he confessed to me vaguely in conversation in London. There is, in fact, tinder enough about to take fire, if the Ibn Rifada affair precipitated a serious situation. 7. This brings me back to Ibn Rifada, whose position and prospects are still shrouded in mystery. My French colleague is convinced that the Government here are concealing facts, and that the situation in the north is more serious than they will admit. I think he is going less on any known facts than on a plausible theory that tribesmen may v^ell be supposed to have rallied to the invader, and that underpaid garrisons, notably that at Tebuk, have long been so discontented that they might easily go over. On my suggesting that, if the situation were really serious, the King w^ould probably take it in hand himself and go at least as far as Medina, M. Maigret developed the theory that Ibn Saud dared not leave Taif owing to -the doubtful loyalty of the tribes round that place, of whose restiveness he had heard tales similar to those brought me bv the Indian vice-consul. 8. I take the opportunity of mentioning one matter of actual fact. You will remember that, on the 4th June, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin mentioned to me the arrest of a launch from Suez at Wejh. On the 8th June I found that my French colleague had been approached about this by a certain Ansara, who had brought the launch to Wejh. M. Maigret was at first cautious, but he told me, on the 20th J^ 16 ^ that he had ascertained that the vessel w T as under the French flag, although Ansara was, he said, an Egyptian, not a Syrian, as I had heard e se\\ here. He then took the matter up with some vigour with the Acting . mister for Foreign Afiairs, but has not so far got any explanation of the arrest except that it was due to contravention of unspecified regulations. No one can, °^, W V e ° ie launch carried, but the Hejazi Government evidtentlv fM to hfL as ^ey have detained her and her crew since the ay n a e ri ^ ^ ^ sa ^. reea hleness with the French. Ansara himself is said I 1S T ^hether as a free man or as a prisoner, I know not. As I write, I learn that he has got as far a§ Jedda by car. fYkmrnio * am ^ les of this despatch to His Majestv’s High Commissioners for Trans] rdan, Iraq and Egypt. J ' I have, &amp;c.

Sir, I hay® the honour to say that natters hare apparently come to a head between Bin Baud and the powerful Qusaibi family. In a conysrsation with the Adviser before a third person, 1 Abdulla iusaibi, who is notoriously hot-headed,stated all the brothers had combined and signed a letter to Bin Baud saying that they would not supply him with any goods on credit unless he made some arrangement for settling their outstanding debts which amount to some 17 lacs of f rupees. •Abdulla ^us&amp;ibi expre eed himself with unusual heat and stated that they had even given an ultimatum to their Hoyal master to the effect that if their demands were not met, they would remove their families from Nejd to Bahrain and apply to be registex ed as Bahrain Subjects. 2 ' i have little doubt that the situation is perfectly correctly described. ’Abdul ’Aziz went to Jedda with the thinly veiled intention of extracting some money from Bin Saud and it is obvious from other information I have received that he hos completely failedfailed. X he.va also noticed that the usual shipments on behalf of His Kajesty were not being made by the (JUBaibis but were being made by other firms and new has been received of a consignment of 17.000 bags of rice due to be shipped shortly through Bahrain to the mainland under arrangements to Haji 'Abdulla Zainal, the brother of 1'uharamad 'All Zainal, who was f-nnerly (iaimmaqam of Jedda. This consignment is to be paid for in instalments, though it is very doubtful that they will be any more successful in extracting nayment that the all powerful ^UBaibis have found themselves to be, 3, The Qusaibis are undoubtedly pledged to the hilt with Bin Baud and can ill afford to break with him, for any repudiation or delay in settling his debt of 17 lacs, coming on top of the sum they have lost in the insolvency of iiabib Rosenthal, may have a disastrous effect on them ?ind render it difficult for them to pay the instalments due to pearl dealers in Bahrain. However foolish •Abdulla may be, •Abdul ’Asia, the senior partner and creator of the fin has great Intelligence and I do not doubt that he will find some moons of bringing Bin baud to torraa ©ven though it my take time,though his task will be facilitated when the firms who are taking their place discover the difficulty in obtaining payment from their august client, I have etc,, (bgd) C,G.

According to private accounts of the gathering His Majesty indulged in extremely strong language about the abuses complained of by pilgrims and, while excusing the irregular!ties practised by exploiters of the poorer sort, criticized in the severest terras people in Intermediate positions and most of all those of the highest class, including, it is said, his own officials. He in reported to have spoken of chopping off heads as a remedy bhich he had thought of applying at once, and with his own hand, but for which on the present ocoasion he was substituting a wamlngj and to have attacked the younger of his hearers for their inclination to road Egyptian political literature anct uo tread in the materialistic ways of Hurope. There may be a good deal of axaggeratlon in the version which I have summarized in the preceding paragraph but the speech seems nevertheless to have been intended as a cautionary sermon for the special benefit of the Hejazis.

CONFIDENTIAL. | r • o Section 1. [E 2815/62/25} No. 1. Mr. Hope Gill to Sir John Simon.—\Received June 9.) (No. 205.) Sir, Jedda, May 11, 1932. IN my immediately preceding despatch is transmitted a translation of a speech delivered by Ibn Sand in Mecca on the 12th April, as reported in the “ Umm-al-Qura.” I understand from some who were present that much more was said in the same vein of religious emotion, but that the newspaper has succeeded in adequately reproducing the main gist of the matter. 2. The occasion was the customary Royal banquet given to some 500 repre sentative Moslems three days before they set out to observe the day of pilgrimage at Arafat. Neither the Indian vice-consul nor, I think, any of the Moslem foreign representatives were present, although they were invited. A number of prominent Indian pilgrims attended however. 3. The speech as heard and retailed has been badly received and is severely criticised, the remark: “ By God, I fear the foreigner once, but I fear those who pretend to be Moslem three thousand times,' being regarded as particularly offensive. My Turkish and Iraqi colleagues are highly incensed at the uncomplimentary reference to the Saudi regime’s predecessors, to “ the bloodshed then done, the sins committed, and the peace violated.” I am credibly informed that when Ibn Sand came to Jedda after the pilgrimage he shocked a number of leading Jeddawis by greeting them with the words : ‘‘ I could cut the throats of every one of you.” 4 All observers are agreed that Ibn Sand is at his wits’ end to obtain money, and many affirm that he is feeling insecure. He certainly seems to have lost much of the poise and balance which distinguished him in the early days of his llejazi adventure. His present state of uncertainty, with its symptomatic lack of control of ideas and expression, but not yet of action, seems to me to be caused by a very real fear for his financial position, an increased feeling of futility amid the complexities of government, and a growing sense of the hostility which surrounds him in the Hejaz and the Moslem world outside. It was noticed that during the forty-eight hours which he recently spent at Jedda he remained outside the town, which he normally never fails to visit for some inspection or other; indeed he hardly put foot outside the palace building. 5. The effect of these obsessions is aggravated by ill-health. At my short formal audience of the 1st May Ibn Saud was listless, and looked a very different man from what he was a year and a half ago. His face had yellowed under the skin and was pouchy, puckered, and much more lined. Dr. Naji-al-Asil, who has had a number of private audiences in Mecca, confirms my impression that Ibn Baud is physically very unwell and mentally obsessed by problems which he cannot solve and which he now fears to face. It is probable that he will return to Riyadh as soon as he decently can, probably in less than a month's time. 6. I may here mention that on the 1st May Ibn Saud was polite, but distant. Hesmiledonceor twice, but had nothing to say. I purposely allowed two long pauses to lengthen in order to draw, if possible, some reference to current topics, such as the Minister’s absence. Ibn Saud at length broke the first silence with a comment on the weather, which had already received adequate comment. I broke the second one myself with a request for permission to leave. I have, &amp;c. C. G. HOPE GILL. [489 i—1}/ Copy, fio. 255.

One of His gracious favours is that God Almighty also imposed upon them the performance or five prayers and commanded them to gather at ouch prayers and especially on Friday, which He distinguished with many merits. Hs also fixed for them the greatest day in this ^lessee spot which is the pource of the divine inspiration and religion, as one of the greatest favours of ood Almighty. w « cnoul confessconfess to such favours, and the confession must not he through tne tongue only hut hy heart and soul as well so that we shall perform one of the duties or the first principles. Moslems have confess to the favours of God and to express their thanks for the came. Unity and cooperation amongst Moslems and following His Command: 'Keep fast to the word of God f all f and do not separate? Cod Almighty gave us the example of His Prophet and commanded us in His Holy Book to follow that example in the Prophet of God. 3o it is our duty to follow the example of the Prophet and his friends. Do you know what ruined religion and increased misguidance amongst Moslems ? This is only due to dispute and disagreement amongst Moslems. If we go hack to the early days of Islam and think of the countries which the Moslems conquered, the idols they destroyed and the great prosperity they achieved, we shall find that all that happened was only due to agreement in and keeping to the religious commands, sincerity in work, honesty and faithfulness. God graciously granted Islam and unity to Moslems, hut when they separated they were defeated and God empowered their enemies over them. So if the Moslems re-cooperate and help each other, their old dignity and glory will return to them. God says:- 'God will not change the state of people until they change it hy themselves'. Pate is doubtless coming. When Moslems acted wisely and exchanged advice, they achieved the highest stage, hut when they disputed they came to such a state as we now see and regret. The soul is inclined to commit evils. Perhaps one man is aware of this and fails to take steps to safeguard himself against it, while another might know the religion and act in accordance with its principles; and so God, being aware of his heart, renders his efforts successful. Moslems now-a-days are awaking from sleep and inadvertance. They should therefore take hold of their weapon which is of two kinds:kind®* the material weapon, such as aeroplanes etc#; the Moslems cannot possess of this kind such as their enemies possess of already, unless God is willing# The other weapon which is greater than the above-mentioned one ; is that which I advise myself and you to follow, namely piety and the keeping of the commands of God# If you follow this advice you will attain glory in this world and be granted pardon in the next# The Mercy of God extends to everything* This nation con achieve no progress except in the way followed by its first ones# Any other way is useless# I admit that power is necessary in everything, in Agriculture, politics and industry, and in every thing that comes under obedience to God, but in anything contrary to this, it is useless to obey the creature and to disobey the Creator# The Prophet of God recommended learning foreign languages, because they are to be considered as amongst the means pf power over the enemy, so that he may overcome them not# So were his friends after him* We have associated today in the best places under the Islamic religion to discuss obedience to God Almighty, and without such obedience no success can be achieved# He who is In confusion may come to us and we will explain to him, he who has any advice may say it, and as for the obstinate, we pray God that He may safeguard us against his evils and for him we do not care# If the relations between me and God are good, I do not care if the relations between me and all people lijje bad# We are human beings and are not everlasting nor remain for ever# The best of all creatures has passed away and his friends too have also passed away after him# Man should endeavour and try to do his best for the general welfare and interest# People have been talking too much about the an; its people# They criticise them only because they believe in God Almighty, the ever Praiseworthy# The Hejax was once under the Turks and then under the Sherifs before us, and these men are the bom of the past anea.

It will be remembered that the question of a loan was raised by the Hejaz Mission during their visit to this country when they were given to understand that there was no possibility oi any loan from His Majesty’s Government and were put in touch with the Bank of England and with commercial circles in the City, who made it clear to them that there was equally no prospect of being p-le to raise a loan in the open market^ vCU^U.S.^.J It is very regrettable that we should have to face the risk of a treaty of friendship and commerce between Ibn Saud and the Soviet, and that he should be to any extent dependent on the Soviet for financial assistance. But it is clearly as impossible for us t to advance money as it is apparently unlikely that the market would take up the loan, and in the circumstances i* there nothing for it but a refusal. The Treasury agree and the Foreign Office propose, unless we see any objection, to instruct Jeddah accordingly. They enquired whether the Government of India were likely to advance money. I said there was no prospect whatever of this. I submit that I may be authorised to inform the Eastern Department that we concur in the action proposed by them. 7 ^ 0.1 &gt; / ^Decypher From hMTAZ^NEJDo n -* O J- ,r A* Ryan (Jedda) t 13th June, 1932 B. 7oOC p.m. 13th June, 1932 R. 9.46 p.mo 13th June, 1932, No o 75- Your despatch No* 167. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs delivered personal message from Ibn Sa.ud. this morning Pegging His Majesty's Government to reconsider decision regarding loan to Hedjaz Government. He required only from £150,000 to £200,000 gold Failing reconsideration by His Majesty's Government he must unwillingly accept assistance from Soviet v/ho were prepared to lend up to £1,000,000 which was more than he wanted. They desired in exchange treaty of friendship and commerce which he was unwilling to conclude and would in any case confine within narrow limits 0 Soviet loan would take form of goods and British trade would be effected. He did not desire latter result and would not go back on his friendship with His Majesty's Government whatever happended.

X XX 2. As regards a loan by it was quite out ofthe question for them to meet the wishes tiff the He#azi Govt in the matter.. But arrangements had been made since the last meeting that Fuad Bey Hamza should be received at the Bank of England, where he would be given explanations as to the present financial situat on in the city and could discuss the possibility of a public loan or one by some reputable financial house. But in saying tL this he did not desire to raise any false hopes. He had also spoken to the Chairman of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Chief Manager of the Bank, Mr.Eldred, would be happy to see Fuad Bey and to explain to him the preliminaries necessary before the flotation of a loan. But as the present time was most unpropitious for any financial ventures, Mr.Eldred would discuss the possibility of the Imperial Bank of Persia acting as London correspondents of the Hejazi Govt, should this be desired. Sir L.Oliphant had also consulted a high official of the Treasury, who had confirmed his conviction that there was little, if any, chance of a loan for the Hejazi Govt, being entertained ii the city at the present time.It was a great personal grief and disappointment to him that HTM.G could not see their way to assist the Hejazl Govt with a loan. His Govt might now H hove no alternative but to look elsewhere for help He wished to be quite frank and not leave H.M.G under a flase impression. interrupted him to assure him that it was a matter of great regret to H.M.G., rfto. and that it was of course natural that the Hejazi Got should try to raise a loan elsewhere; and that H.M.G would not for a moment misunderstand such action. continued that in connexion with Transjordan eic eic. x x x As re sards the Soviet, he thought it unlikely that theru would be any important change in the attitude of his Govt.P.z 3253/32.

Fu ad Bey Hanza emphasised the present econont difficulties of the Hejaz Nejd. King Abdul Aziz ardently desired the help of H.M.G., The needs of the Hejaz Nejd Goot, are numerous. They require above all financial help. The mission was therefore charged to enquire hrhether H.M'G could a. loan to the Hejaz .*ejd Govt and help them in other ways in their economic difficulties. xxx ^ Passing to 2) the Mission's request for a loan, Sir L^Oliphant^ explained the diffilulties in this time of most stringent economy. He would not mislead •^uad Bey £nto thinking it was at all likely that uhe mission's request could be acceded to. He would however, put the point to the Treasury and would give an answer soon, so that the mission mi£jit, if they wished, approach financial houses, although he feared that from that quarter too, the chances of getting a loan were remote. PuadJBi^ Hunza s &amp;id that if, H.M.G., could not themselves make a loan to his Govt, they could perhap arrange one with some financial houses. His Govt only required a loan of £500,000. In answer to a question, he explained that he meant £500,000 gold, or its equivalent, and that he had data as to what could be offered as security.

(E 668/165/25) Sir, '&gt;‘ r 9 9 l n i jedda, _ January 21st, 1932. t ‘ S 5 2, _J v/ith reference to my despatch No. 492 of December 28, I have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of January 15 published the text of what purports to be a budget for the lunar year beginning Sha’bgn 1,1350, i.e. December 11, 1931. I enclose a translation of the finance law and attached statement, as published. It will be observed that there is a discrepancy of Piastres miri 486,458 between the items and the total shown. 2. The publication oi this enactment must be regarded as a distinct advance. The budget is nevertheless merely an estimate of expenditure under various heads. It is assumed that revenue will be available to meet this expen diture but no attempt is made to estimate the anticipated revenue from various sources. It is not stated whether the budget applies to the Hejaz or to the whole of Ibn Sa'ud’s dominions. 3. I had some conversation regarding the budget with Fuad Bey Hamza on January 19, when I was discussing the position in regard to certain British claims. I congratulated him in the step forward made by his Government. I observed that, while the amount ear-marked for the payment of debts did not appear to be 25% of the total, as we had been led to expect, it was nevertheless a substantial sum, viz., £ gold 150,000 on the assumption that Piastres Miri meant gold Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.gold piastres at the rate of 110 to the £ gold. He had told me incidentally the previous evening that the Government knew exactly the amount of their liabilities up to the beginning of the financial year. I suggested that as they were in this happy position and had now ear-marked a definite sum, which they presumably knew would be available, lor paying off the debts, they should be in a position to give concrete indications to their creditors of the instalments which they intended to pay and the dates on which payment might be expected. 4. Fuad Bey explained that the amount ear-marked for debts bore in reality a greater proportion to anticipated receipts than would appear. Much of the expenditure shown in 'Piastres Miri' would in fact be incurred in silver. Otherwise, he admitted, the budget would not balance at all. The 16,500,000 piastres miri allocated to debt were, however, gold piastres as I had supposed. I refrained from comment on the singularity of a budget which lumps Piastres Miri whether gold or silver in a single statement, at a time when the Government have practically abandoned the pretence that silver riyals are still at the old legal parity of 10 to the £ gold. 5 . Fuad Bey seemed to have no illusions as to the uncertainty of the revenue prospects. I was mainly concer ned with the operation of the moratorium implied in the decision to treat all debts up to the beginning of the financial year as a floating debt to be paid off by instalments. When I pursued this topic, he told me quite cheerfully that, if things went badly, the Government would be unable to pay and would have to go on from one moratorium toto another. He suggested that after all, if money did not come in, it would he owing to causes for which the Government had no responsibility, meaning no doubt that revenue must depend on the volume of the pilgrimage, which would be determined by causes beyond the control of the Government. 6 . There is much to be said for Fuad Bey’s point of view, despite its apparent levity. I fear, however, that the publication of this so-called budget, although interesting as an indication of the v/ish of the Government to put their house in order, will have little effect on the practical finance of this country for the coming year. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Bagdad and Jerusalem and His Majesty’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

I had asked the Air Offioer Commanding in Iraq if arrangements oould be made to bring jolonel Dickson down by air to Bahrain, and he very kindly placed a flying boat at his disposal, and Colonel Dickson arrived on the 22nd. Meanwhile telegraphic com^unication had been established informally between Bahrain and Hasa, and T received a message from Ibn Baud asking me to come as soon as poss ible as he was anxious to return to Riadh, and informing me that arrangements had been made for my reception at Ojair. as I thou ht it probable that questions concern ing Bahrain might arise during the discussions I asked permission from Hie Majesty to bring Captain Briar with me and whis was readily accorded. Accordingly on the 25rd we proceeded front Bi lag on the south aide of Bahrain Island, in a launch belonging HIS KAJXBXY'S 5SCRSUARY OF SaAll FOR £K« COLOR!AS, COLONIAL OFFICE , LONDON. fi-8- belonging to the (iu.nlbl., to OJalr. n.rtunately tho weather was line and we aoooapHshed the Journey In •bout Uto and a half houre. At Ojalr I wee reoelved by Yuaui Yaaln, ;:le Majesty'* Private Keoretary, and luft at about 3,30 for Ha*a. xhe road for about the firet 35 miles runs over a series of sand-dunes, which I think would certainly be described ae quite impracticable for motor transport, except ior^diately after rain. However, there seems to be no limitation to the capabilities of J ‘ ;r * S' or &lt; il » products and the car in which I was driving surmounted these piles of sand without check, and we reached Hasa at 5.30. ifce other cars which were roacibly not in such good condition and were also more heavily laden were not so fortunate and our luggage and servants did not arrive till 1 p«m, the following day, hiving taken about 22 hours to accomplish the 49 miles' journey. 3. Jolonel Dickson, Jap tain Prior and I were lodged in the same house ae that occupied by His Majesty and arrangements were made to provide us with European food. Owing to the fact that it was the month of Ramaian it would in any case have been awkward for us to have attended dinner, of which His Majesty partook at about 5.30, directly after sunset. boon after my arrival His Majesty came and saw me and we had about an hour's conversation on ordinary subjects. fe stayed in Has a four days, during which our prograwiie was as follows: about 10 a.m. Yusuf Yasin would visit us and after half and hour's talk we went to visit the King, with whom iBcusslons took place lasting generally two hours. After lunch Yusuf Yasin occasion ally came and had a short discussion and in the afternoon cars were placed at our disposal and we were Allowedallowed to vleit the nujttarous hot springs with whioh the Has a Gael a abound® and to walk through the date grove®. we were Inforufed that it wa® undesirable that we should proceed on foot through the town, a po»e # I think, on Ibn Saud»® part, elnoe the population nowidaye is not In the least fanatical whatever it may have been once. On our return on two day® we had further interrlewe with the Ting, each lasting about one and a hali hours, an after- tinner dlocurcion&amp;with Yusuf Yaein, lasting generally till mid-night. 4. Xhe following matters were discussed either with the King or with Yusuf Ya®in, and win form the eubjeote of separate despatches: (1) fhe Kuwait blockade; (ii) Emergenoy landing ground® on the Kasa coast; (ill) felegraphio and postal communication between Kaea and the outer world via Bahrain; (iv) Passport facilities for Najdi subject® proceed ing to India or Iraq; (vj fhe possibility of some consular statu® being afforded to Nejdi reprosentativee in Bahrain and Kuwait; (vi) Incure tone by h'ejdl official® uid troops Into Kuwait territory; (vii) fhe possibility of having a very simple extra dition treaty between Bahrain and Nejd. *b Bt*ited above, the details of these discueeion® will be dealt with separately and I will content myself here with saying that throughout all our talk® Hi® Majesty*® attitude w&amp;b one of extreme cordiality and naturally hi® Secretary took hi® cue from hip. Kven bo controversial a matter ; &gt;e the Kuwait blockade, after a little preliminary fultnlnttin*, on the UBua).M -4- ■Jr' usual lines, was disousBed by the King in a most friendly spirit, and when he lays himself out to please Chare are few men who ean be more charming than Ibn Baud, His Majesty was looking extremely well; he informed me that when he left the Heja* he had been leading a rery sedentary life and had done a gro -t deal of work and had been feeling rery tired. Latterly, howerer, he had been going out hunting In the desert, which had done him a great deal of good and he hoped after the f Id to spend another month or so in the desert with his family before proceeding to the Hejas for the HaJ. He mentioned that he was 53 years of age now, and as the Arabic year is eleven days shorter then the solar year this would make him about 51 according to our reckoning. He certainly does not look more. He made no attempt to disguise his financial difficulties, to which he referred repeatedly. He stated that the expenditure of the Hejas was a million pounds and its revenue about eight hundred thousand, and of all the revenues of Hasa one-fourth went to uusaibis (presumably against advances received from them), one-fourth went to Ibn Jiluwi for the administra tion, and one-fourth was remitted to the Kejaz. He was had in such straits that he/written to his leading Shaikhs Informing them that in future he could only receive them on certain stated occasions, and that they were not to visit him at other times. He mentioned that he himself had no private estates and that the Beit-al-Mal which formerly went to the privy purse was now paid into the general revenues and that literally he hardly knew how to support himself \nd his family. 5. On the other hand his expend! ture on motor cars must be enormous. I was told that he had between five and six hundred, and there is no doubt th&gt;it they are run on the most wasteful lines. The wear and tear on a oar across Ivorosc desert traote is of course very high and X hare no d ' Ubi lhat h * le r ® w * 4 and left by hie ohauffeure. apart from this, if he le to etop hie tribes raiding, he amet giro them allowances and thie must be a Tory hoary drain, and there le no doubt that Ms position financially i* i parlous One. On the other hand, in Sejd at any ra^ whatever aay be the position in the Hejaz, although I think he has aomowhat lost his position as a spiritual leader his writ still runs unquestioned throughout the length and breath of the land, &gt;in interesting sidelight on Ibn S tud’s methods of administration was furnished on the day of aiy departure. fwo members of the Murra tribe had stolen some oamels, and after four days’ pursuit were captured by ibrj Jiluwi ’b men. rhe latter was for haring them killed but Xbn Saud commuted the sentence and decreed i,hat they should each hare one leg and one arm out off. fhie was done on the morning of my departure and the dis membered limbs were exposed publicly in the bazaar. It will probably be a long time before any other member of this tribe steals a camel. An enlightened member of the Bahrain commercial community, with whom 1 returned, spoke most approvingly of this method of punishment and said that the British sytitem of locking a man up was no deterrent ?ii all - a view which in the case of Beduin tribes is probably correct. In the oouee of conversation Ibn Saud said to me that though the British Government had troops, aero planes and ships they could not control the bird upon the twig, neither could they control the Beduli, but he (Ibn Baud) could, and certainly sc far his authority in Bejd is unquestioned. HisKi» MAjeaiy spoke most warmly about the late fclr Gilbert Clayton, and said that he gave a definite “yse or a definite *no H md was a man, and he knew where he was with him. He further mentioned that &amp;r. Philby had just left Haea to gross the Rub-al-Khali, and in order poeeibly to outdo the exploits of Mr. Xhomac, he was going to arose It twice, proceeding by one route to the Kadra&amp;aut and then back by another route. He spoke cordially of Mr. Ihilby and said that although hotheaded he was a loyal friend. 6 . !/e left Haea on the 28th of January after a most pleasant stay of four days, and as our luggage on this occasion got through with greater rapidity we were enabled to leave Ojair in the ^usaibi launch at 4 p.m. and, again favoured by good weather, had a smooth cross ing and arrived in Bahrain about midnight. fhere I was delayed for four lays awaiting the departure of the mail steamer, but we finally left on the 1 st February getting^ back to Buahire on the 2nd. 7. At my last interview when I went to say good bye to him just before I left Tbn £.aud sakad me to trans mit a message from him to His M^je^ty’s Government, and after he had delivered it verbally I suggested that Yueuf , Yasin should write it down: His Majesty therefore dictated itto him, and freely translated it rune as follows. W I wish you to give my greetings t© the British Government and say to them that T speak to them with the word of a Muslim Arab. 'Firstly, that I do not desire or seek greater friendship from anyone else in all the world, either from among the European or the Muslim powers, than that which I have with the Bri**ahBritish GOTsrnment, and it Is quite impossible that I should oppose theif. in any matter. Secondly, I desire peaoe and friendship with the whole world but specially with those of my neighbours and others who are in relations with the British Government, and whoever says to the contrary is in error, or a liar, or has misunderstood. And I ask of them that if any one says such a thing of me, that they should refer the matter to me and let me know what mistake I am supposed to have com.it ted; but on the condition that the reference should be made through an intelligent man who can grasp the actual facts and will not misconstrue thsm.' Xhe Arabic is in one of two places a little ambiguous, doubtless due to the fact that the King took no trouble to chose his words but dictated it straight away. 8 . a&lt;y visit was, I think, unquestionably a success ful one chiefly owing to the fast that it was Informal and that I came with no instructions from His Majssty’s Government but simply to trstablish friendly relations and talk over questions of interest to ue both in a friendly epirit. Ibn baud was friendly, cordial and reasonable, and at times, when recalling his battles and intrigues of fonaar times with the lurks, interesting and amusing. Kle attitude towards the two questions that T was kh. eia.rg.noy lending ground, on the 1 aaa oo«et, wa« elpi'ul, and a. regard, the lattar I *ae given ole.rl to under a land that there would be no &lt;H ffi cull tie. 1 therefore enclose a copy of the message in Arabic ae\ well chiefly late rested in, tmmVf the Kuwait blockade and about•8«* at,out i id 11 lies on lelando, though ha wats atlU oopoaed to landlngo on the mlnland. 9. on my departure Ibn Saud expressed the hope the we flight meet agiin and I hope an opportunity will reour next year* Ibn Baud presented me with a etallion and a mare and aleo gawe a horse each to Colonel Dickson and captain I rior together with the customary abbas and ^hawle. xhe horses are of no value at all and I am endeavouring to induce some Arab Shaikh to take them. Colonel Diokeon assured we that this would not be viewed amiss since such presents are regarded as of a purely oarewonlal nature. Moreover among the presents given to my staff was a gold watch which had on the back of it the iioyal British Arms and had presumably been presented at some time by Hie Majesty’s Government to Ibn baud. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddah and to the Government of India. I have, etc. (Sgd.) K.V. BI&amp;COJS. It.

Sir, I hare the honour to state that during ray recent vieit to Hie Majesty King Ibn Laud, 1 discussed with him the question of the Kuwait blockade. I began by informing His Majesty that my visit was entirely private and informal and that I had no mission of any kind, neither had I received any instructions from His Majesty's Government, and emphasised that His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah was of course the channel for official communications. At the same time it might be desirable to discuss any questions connected with the Persian Gulf informally, and I asked Ibn Laud if he had any matters which he wished to raise affecting the Gulf. 2. Ibn Laud replied that sometimes quite small matters loomed large in places in which they irose, because the places themselves are so small and that he had nothing of importance that he wished to discuss. I then said that there was one matter regarding which I would like to take the opportunity of ascertaining Hie Majesty's views and that was the embargo on trade between Kuwait and Hejd. I pointed out that at present Kuwait was being ruined by the cessation of its commerce with the interior; that the customs receipts had fallen from is Majesty's Secretary of State for the Golonies, Colonial Office, LOKPOK . i vi m ‘fro&gt; about sight lakhs to under two and that though some of thje loee might be due to the prevailing oommerolal depreeoion, there was no doubt that . uch of it wae owing to the blockade which Hie ttajeety had imposed. X asked Hie Majesty whether in view of hie eloee former relations with Kuwait aofoe means could not be found to alleviate the situation. Ibn Saud said that Kuwait interests were hie and that he and Shaikh Ahmad were brothers, but what h «2 fired was the loss to hie own country. Ke had to consider that first of all. He was in direst straits for money; though he made small allowances to his sons he took nothing for hie privy purse. He had no private domains and the Bei t-al-i^al which formerly went to the Huler was now paid into the general revenues. He added: T Cftear by (jrod as a Inuslim that I have no money for my children, for family, and X know not if they will have money for food and clothing. Money is a question of life and death and no country can do without it**. If he allowed his tribes to go to Kuwait he would lose the revenue now derived from Hasa and OJair. 3. I mentioned that in the days of the former Bejd government the tribes traded with Kuwait and the then government presumably took its dues; why should they not do so now? His Majesty replied that then they were all Badu; there was no government, the tribes did as they pleaded. What would suit him ber*t was for his people not to trade with Kuwait under any circumstances. I mentioned that they were apparently permitted to trade with ’Iraq through Zufcair, to which His Majesty replied that he proposed to stop this too, and compel them to get all supplies in their own country through their own porta4. The oonversatlon continued ior »ome time on theee line# and ultimately His Majesty s^id that there were three ways In which the matter could be settled. (1) Ke should be allowed to establish a poet at some place on the outekirte of Kuaait territory, e.g. iTubaihiyah, where he would take his customs, Kuwait to guarantee that all goods should pass through this place, and that nothing should leave its borders by any other route. (2) A Nejd customs post in the hands of Nejdl official, with, however, no ofticlal position in Kuwait, should be established at the gate of Kuwait town and he would collect the Sejd dues as caravans passed out* t (3) Kuwait should make a fixed annual payment representing the Hejd share of the Kuwait cub toms. 5 . X suggested that since caravans must follow certain well-defined routes in order to obtain water a chain of border posts could easily control them, though obviously a few odd camels could slip through from time to time. His Majesty retorted that smuggling would certainly take place and that even now they could not prevent luxuries which paid higher duty from being smuggled. I pointed out that i t was virtually impossible on a long frontier line to stop a certain amount of smuggling in any country and that we had be^n unable effectively to stop gunrunning despite the expenditure of very la*^® sums of aroney, but what was possible-4 possibles WM to exerolse oontrol ovsr o urayans oonvsylng smuggled goods into the Interior provided the oaravane pasted through one's own territory. ihe Persian Joverrusent had 5,0 a very large extent reduced smuggling into lersia not by patrols along the ooast but by making it exeeedlngly difficult to transport goods into th« interior. 6 . Kia fcajeoty then went on u&gt; eay that If he allowed trade with Kuwait Ojair would be killed and Haea would loee one-fourth of Its trade. So for the time being I left the matter at that. 7. Subsequently, I dl loused the matter with Yusuf Yaein, and he informed me that His Majesty had realised that proposals ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) put forward by him %'re impracticable* Kuwait oould not possibly guarantee that all goods would pass through the tunnel of Subalhiy* or wherever it might be established and he realised that the suggest 1 on of establishing a oustoma post at town the gate of Kuwait/would never be accepted by the Shaikh, and in any case would prove unworkable. For instance, many of the Kuwait Araibdar and tribesmen from ’Iraq come in to purchase goods in Kuwait. It would not be possible for the Nejd officials to distinguish between thein. Ihe only solution he oould sug, eot was that there should be an annual payment by Kuwait to Nejd. Xfc* iihaikh however had informed Golonel Diokeon previously that he would never agree to anything of this sort as it would be regarded as a tribute in Arabia. 8 . Yusuf Yasln mentioned that some customs arrangement of this kind was in force between Palestine and Syria and in other places. I said I knew nothing about this, but he muet bear In mind that an arrangement which would be perfectly feasible between two powers of equal-5- •qual »landing might b«ar a different appearance when ol war, and that if the Government of India took elrallar action, eay, in the eaee of Goa, in order to divert trade to their own port, Bombay, it would unquestionably evoke very serious protects on the part of the Fortugueee Government, Colonel Dickson and I however did not lines of a payment by Kuwait to fiejd and thought that o • rou,^stancea might force the Shaikh to agree. 9. However, the following day I again returned to the charge with Ibn Saud and made a personal appeal to 5 i ajesiy, pointing out all he owed to Kuwait and the lac*, that he had been brought up there. I said that presumably he did not want to see it ruined and sink to policy were persisted in. fhe king said that he roust oonsider his own interests and that it was for him to milk hie own people and not to supply pasture cows for Kuwait. Ultimately, however, he said that the only solution he could see was for arbitrators from either side consisting of well-known merchants, with possibly one oi icial, to meet and try and work out a compromise that would be agreeable to both parties, but the arbitrators roust be carefully selected for their patience and ability. I welcomed the suggestion and promised to put it before Shaikh Ahmad. 10 . i'he discussion on the whole was conducted in a most friendly spirit. Ibn Saud was not uncompromising and hie description of his financial straits was of entered into between a big man and a small man. I also pointed out that th. biookade really amounted to an aot entirely diemiee the poBBibilUy of some eolution on the course0 oours© oorreot and at preisent at any rat© he oannot tlXord to lose a penny of hi® revenue®. On the other hiiia if any eyctem oan be devieed by which he will not loae revenue or have to incur heavy expenditure on the e®tablishment of poets on the frontier then I think he will be prepared to .-Leet u® half way. I asked Yueuf Yaein if the real reason of the blockade wa® not that Hi® Majesty was afraid that the tribe® might eatablish too close relations with Kuwait. He said: *110, not nowaday©. We have got them too xauoh in hand**. 11. If T may say ®o I think perhaps it would have been helpful if His Majesty^ Government had ®e^n fit to inform the Nejd Governii*«ent of the large and exceedingly well-substantiated claims put forward by Kuwait against them. It would have given me to some ^ extent a lever. All that we could do under the circumstances was for Jo lone 1 Dickson to mention the matter to Yusuf Yasin. While normally I doubt if much oan be acco plished by the appointment of oomndst?!oners, especially in euch oases as frontier affairs, boundaries, etc., the present case is rather different. I have no doubt one of Ibn laud’s commissioners will be a member of the ^uasaibi clan. Kuwait also has one or two merchants of considerable standing. fhe latter will be fighting for their own existence and welfare and will certainly apare no effort to arrive at some arrangement and once the question is reduced to a commercial basis some there is/proapect at any rate of a settlement being arrived at. B'er instance it seems pospible that they might agree to increase the Kuwait customs duties, which are at present merely four per cent, and then for so many annas in the rupee to be paid to Hejd or something of that sort. If an ar angement of this sort was arrivedarrived at between the aot&amp;nlsot^nere, the aerqantile oomxfiunity of Kuwait woul* q^rtalnly bring a good deal of pressure to bear on the Shaikh to aooept it. I would therefore suggeet that if the .shaikh agrees to the appointment of arbitrators Tbn Saud should then be asked through Kls Majesty's Minister at Jeddah to Inform us what type of representatives he proposes to nominate, e.g. whether merchants or officials, so that Kuwait can appoint the same kind of persons. I would eu&amp;gest two merchants and one offiaial, preferably a customs official. When these details have been settled I would suggest that if Sir Andrew Ryan sees no objection he should be authorised to inform &gt;'aud Hamaa personally of the Kuwait alal;«8, and, if he considers it desirable, let him have a copy. Re can say at the same time that His majesty’s Government had not presented these claims as they were hopeful that a friendly settlement of the Kuwait blockade would the be arrived at. If so/Shaikh would be willing to let the olaime go, but that they thought it desirable to let the Nejd Government know informally that these claims had been submitted. I am asking Jolonel Dickson to ascertain Shaikh Ahmad's views regarding the appointment of commissioners and^ypill report further in due course.

January 11, 1932. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2 . r O [E 166/62/25] No. 1 SzV A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 11, 1932.) (No. 493.) Sir, Jedda, December 29, 1931. I HAVE attempted in my despatch No. 492 of the 28th December to give a 7 general view of the economic and financial situation in this country. I have now the honour to submit some account of the political situation and the conjectures to which it gives rise in connexion with Ibn Saud's foreign policy. The data are meagre, and I am even more hampered in this case than in my endeavour to sum up the economic situation by the fact that I have had no real contact with the Hejazi Government since my return to Jedda on the 15th December. I should, indeed, reserve this report for a later occasion were it not for its bearing* on the possibility of trouble on the northern frontiers of the Hejaz. 2. When Ibn Saud went to Riadh about the beginning of July he was completely fed up with the Hejaz and its problems. He doubtless felt, moreover, that the affairs of Nejd required his personal attention. It was significant that before going there he made one spectacular gesture designed to placate extreme Wahhabi opinion by deferring to the opinion of the ulema of Nejd on the impropriety of celebrating annually his accession to the Hejazi Throne. At the same time, he gave another indication of a swing towards the extremists by reviving the machinery for the enforcement of strict religious principles. He did not abandon his schemes for certain improvements on European lines to which fanatics might take exception, like the wireless project. Nevertheless, in the published record of the proceedings of the “ National Conference ” held in June stress was laid on the principle that economic develop ment should be effected by the instrumentality of Moslems, and the King would not allow the Marconi expert, M. Boucicault, to go to Riadh to erect the wireless station there. 3. While the King, on the eve of his departure for Nejd, was thus showing himself not only a good Moslem, but a good Wahhabi, he had not despaired of European assistance. In his June conversations with me he made a strong appeal for a good understanding on all subjects with Great Britain, with special reference to his hope of getting His Majesty's Government to give their patronage to himself rather than to the Hashimites and the feasibility of inducing a British bank to give him financial assistance. He took steps to explore the possibility of raising the wind in other European quarters also, notably in Holland. He engaged in dealings with the Bolshevik representative, but there is nothing as yet to show that he was prepared to give much more to the Soviets than the privilege of supplying him with benzine on easy terms, and possibly some relaxation of the restrictions on their trade. 4. The situation in the Hejaz, bad in June, has grown much worse since then. The towns have every reason for discontent, the tribes for disaffection. It is not possible to speak with equal confidence of Nejd, but it is rumoured that there also there is much dissatisfaction. Apart from the usual tales of trouble with the tribes, there are specific allegations of discontent owing to oppressive taxation, non-payment of the wages of Nejdi soldiers employed in the neighbourhood of the frontier, e.g., at Tabuk, levies in kind on merchants, attempts to impose the use of the unpopular Hejazi rival, and the reforms instituted in Hasa by the mission of At-Tawil. 5. Such is the internal situation with which Ibn Saud has to cope, as he sits tight at Riadh, attempting to deal with the affairs of the Hejaz from a distance with the aid of the advisers summoned in turn to the Nejdi capital; uncertain, perhaps, of his hold on Nejd itself, a country which he can only rule with a strong hand and largess, and the population of which are so little impressed by kingly majesty in itself that they are said still to use in speaking to him the address : “ Ya, Abdul Aziz ! The King must realise by now that [354 1—2]there is little chance of money from Europe or of the kind of positive support from Great Britain for which he begged in June—no British bank, no air force no backing in his latent struggle with tjie Hashimites. Over all lies the shadow of a pilgrimage much smaller than that of last year, and worse times to come in consequence. 6. It cannot be wondered at that some observers expect the King to seek salvation in one or both of two things, adventure over the border, or an agree ment with the Soviets. He has engaged in military preparations, as he is always doing. The tribes, it is said, have been encouraged to hope, or threatened with the necessity of preparing for Jihad. For a time it was thought that the objective was the Yemen, but since my return it has been announced that the King has composed his difference with the Imam in a spirit of piety and love of peace in Arabia. The observers whom I have just mentioned are all the more disposed to think that he is preparing an onslaught on Transjordan, with the object of gratifying his mingled hatred and fear of the Amir Abdullah and gaining access, perhaps, to richer lands than his own. I cannot myself believe that he would be so foolish as to engage openly in an enterprise which would bring him into direct conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but the possibilitv cannot be dismissed in the case of a man, strong-willed and ambitious, who is already in hard straits and may be desperate in a few months. There is the alternative possibility of the same object being pursued less openly by the promotion of authorised raids. 7. Assuming for the sake of hypothesis that Ibn Sand has some such object in view, three questions, among many others, call for special consideration: What financial resources could he employ for the purposes of his adventure? What is the extent of the reported military preparations? On what outside assistance or sympathy could he rely, from the Soviets or otherwise? I will glance at these in order. 8. No one knows what reserve the King has at Riadh, despite the impoverishment of the country and the Hejazi Treasury. It has been suggested that he has been collecting treasure there, perhaps not gold or not all gold, but in other forms, e.g., riyals or jewellery. War taxes are said to have been levied on the Hejazi tribes and on the Nejdi townsfolk, 10 riyals a head, it is said, from the tribesmen, 400,000 riyals from those in the area round Taif, and further sums from those in the north. According to one account, the latter represented to the Amir Feisal their miserable poverty and offered men with riding camels instead of cash, an offer which the Amir undertook to refer to the King, but which the latter was thought unlikely to accept owing to his lack of confidence in the Hejazi tribesmen. Another tale is that the merchants of Anaiza and Buraida are owed £60,000 and have little chance of payment, though eight of them made their way to Mecca to ventilate their grievance, despite the efforts of the Governor of Medina to prevent them from getting further than that place. I cannot pronounce on the probability or otherwise of the King having collected any substantial liquid reserve at Riadh by the alleged exactions and other means, but Mr. Hope Gill, who has followed developments during my absence, especially Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s financial policy, believes in it. 9. As regards the extent of the King’s military preparations, I can again rely only on distorted rumours and a few items of fact. He has, of course, his garrisons on the frontier and in certain places not far from it, and he could obtain men from Nejd for a definite enterprise promising warfare and loot. Such troops as there were in Jedda would appear to have been moved to Mecca almost in their entirety. I see in a report from the Political Agent at Bahrein, dated the 23rd November, that an informant newly arrived from the mainland had noted an unusual withdrawal of horsemen towards Nejd, and supposed that they might be intended for an attack on the Femen. I quote with great reserve a report which has reached me here that the Polish engineer employed in the Government workshop at Mecca has been sent to recruit airmen in Poland. A good deal has been spent during the last year or more on military supplies. It is now said that it 1 ^ ave ^ een repaired in the Mecca workshops, that there were recently ' u ln ^ anc ^ w hich the mechanics were being pressed to repair without delay, and that further rifles were expected to be brought from the interior for the same purpose It is also said that the Soviet representative has been offering rifles, with 1,200 cartridges each, at £2 10*. per rifle, c.i.f. Whether this be true or not, my informant, the Indian vice-consul, says that a friend of his who wentTJ 11 ? a S° ^ le Soviet Legation to buy sterling chanced on one of the A1 r adhl family and other Nejdis engaged in inspecting various kinds of rifle. 10. ifie third question need not be dealt with at length. My Russian colleague here has always struck me as more interested in commerce than in politics, and f see nothing in his burst of activity last summer or its results up to date to make me alter that opinion. 1 can see the Soviets selling rifles or anything else to Ibn Saud on cheap and easy terms, but not at the present time backing him in a foreign adventure otherwise than by perhaps looking on genially at any attempt he might make to fish in troubled waters. I discard as fantastic a further suggestion by my principal informant that Russia might, in an endeavour to compass the destruction of the British position in the Middle East, draw Ibn Saud into a general alliance comprising Turkey and Persia. I feel that! if Ibn Saud contemplated further adventure, he would work, as he has alwavs done, on his own expansive lines, a raider in the grand condottiere manner. There may be more to be said for suggestions that he has sought to gain Islamic sympathy through agents in countries like Transjordan, the Yemen and Hadhramaut, perhaps even further afield. 11. This is not intended to be an alarmist despatch. I am only too conscious that the basis of ascertained fact on which I have built is very slender. In my attempt to produce a balanced superstructure I may have given it too formidable an appearance. While writing I have had before me the extremely interesting paper by Major Fowle enclosed in Mr. Walton’s letter to Mr. Rendel of the l^th November. It will be seen that, though Major Fowle pays me too great a compliment in suggesting that I know more about Ibn Saud than anyone else, mv mind has been working on the same general lines as his. There is this difference : that looking at the King in the light of the most recent events, I suspect that the test of his success may come before he disappears from the scene, and I conceive tentatively the possibility of Ibn Saud himself, rather than his successor, being driven to the course suggested in paragraph 10 (b) of Major Fowle's memorandum, that of launching Wahhabi attacks on the surrounding unbelievers. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, His Majesty’s High Commissioners for Transjordan and Iraq, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). January 11, 1932. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 165/165/25! No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 11, 1932.) (No. 492.) Sir, Jedda, December 28, 1931. SINCE my return to Jedda on the 15th December, I have endeavoured to obtain a general view of the economic and financial situation in this country. Although I can add little to the information already in your possession, I think it worth while to attempt a comprehensive picture of what 1 find after an absence of five months. In drawing it I have not had the advantage of any contact with high Government circles, for, as you know, the King remains at Riadh and most of his advisers have been summoned thither, including Fuad Bey Hamza, who left Mecca for Nejd almost simultaneously with my arrival in Jedda. The only Hejazi personage of any consequence whom I have seen is the rich old Governor of Jedda, who hardly counts as an official any longer. Though still to some extent employed as a consultant on great occasions, he now concerns himself little with the current affairs of his office, so that his outlook is less that of a Government servant than of a merchant. It is no secret that, as a business man and an important creditor of the Government, he views the situation in the country with anxiety and ill-concealed hostility to the present regime. 2. It is generally agreed that the economic position in the country as a whole could hardly be worse. The merchants in Jedda and Mecca have been increasingly embarrassed during the past two years. Of late, they have had to cope not only with depression in trade, but with Government demands for contributions in money or in kind, extorted ostensibly on loan but without any definite prospect of repayment of the money or payment for the goods. Some carry large stocks (e.g., of rice) owing to over-importation earlier this year and in 1930. Monetary crises elsewhere have created a feeling of uncertainty, the net result of which is to create further depression, although there have been passing effects of a contrary kind, e.g., the abandonment of the gold standard by His Majesty’s Government and consequent depreciation of the rupee gave a temporary fillip to the import trade from India. The prices of most imported goods, reckoned in gold, have risen considerably during my absence, though those of local food-stuffs appear to be fairly steady. 3. I am assured that among the tribes, and especially those in the north of the Hejaz, the utmost misery prevails. It is impossible to sift the information, but it is said that, what with the reaction of world conditions, manifested more particularly in the greatly reduced pilgrimage, and the demands of the Government for military purposes, there has been a great depletion of live-stock. I hear of a reduction in the number of camels and of sheep and goats being sold off at ludicrously small prices. Attention is drawn to the influx of half-starved Bedouin into the larger towns, especially, perhaps, Medina, and to the frequent spectacle of hungry tribesmen collecting at the halts on the main road from Jedda to that place. In August I was inclined to doubt the tales of actual starvation, which, it will be remembered, were related by the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London, among others. Early in September the Mecca newspaper “ Umm-al-Qura,' a Government-inspired organ, thought it worth while to contradict a report of famine in the Hejaz which had been circulated in India. In view of what I now hear, I can no longer disregard the reiterated statements made to me regarding hunger and increased mortality. To give one example, possibly exaggerated, I am told of Bedouin dying in Medina at the rate of thirty-five a day. 4. There is little or no prospect of relief being afforded by the 1932 pilgrimage. Some months ago I thought that the number of overseas pilgrims might attain the 1931 figure of about 40,000, though it was unlikely to exceed it. The Government have exerted themselves to stimulate the flow by propaganda, including the announcement of reduced charges and an almost firm promise that Pilgrimage Dav will fall on a Friday. Nevertheless, it now looks as though the [354 l_i ]total number of overseas pilgrims may be nearer 20,000 than 40,000. It i s too soon to make definite estimates, as the number of Indians and Egyptians is always doubtful up to a very short time before the great day, which should fall on or about the 15th April next year. Up to the present, however, only 2,500 pilgrims have arrived from the Dutch East Indies, always first in the field. The Nether lands Legation surmises that this represents about half the total for the season which would thus be about 5,000 as compared with about 16,000 this year. 5. Hopes are still founded on the possible development of new resources the recently discovered or rediscovered water, petroleum and gold. The American expert, Mr. Twitched, followed the procession of high officials to Riadh on the 15th December. The one concrete result of his efforts so far has been the erection of an undoubtedly fine and happily cheap American windmill at the Waziria wells some miles from Jedda, and some quite useful work on the old conduits connecting them with the town. It seems uncertain whether the water is to be used to supply Jedda or for agricultural purposes. Of the gold and petroleum I know nothing new nor have I heard any more of the separate proposal to employ Swedish experts to investigate the petroleum. 6. 1 turn to the financial situation of the Government. Mr. Hope Gill has kept you very fully informed on this subject in a series of despatches ending with his No. 482 of the 13th December. I need not therefore go into the details of the reform schemes which have been so greatly advertised. The general opinion is that, even if revenue prospects were steadier and even if Ibn Saud had men capable of running a rational financial system, the scheme has come too late. The revenue from direct taxation of pilgrims must necessarily diminish. There must be a further decline in customs revenue owing to the falling off of pilgrims and general depression. In his despatch No. 346 of the 29th August Mr. Hope Gill gave figures from a well-informed source showing that the customs receipts had fallen from nearly £1,200,000 in the lunar year ending about the 8th June, 1929, to less than £900,000 in that ending about the 18th May, 1931 Oue of my more pessimistic informants puts the figure as low as £400,000 this year. This may be an underestimate, but I doubt whether a customs revenue of more than half a million can be counted on for the year ending next May. The customs receipts, such as they are, might be used as security for a foreign loan, but only if the lenders could rely on some more or less independent control being established and on a greater prospect of durability than the Saudian regime at present offers. As you are aware, the negotiations with the Dutch Bank broke down and there seems to be no longer any likelihood of a loan being obtained from any European source on commercial lines. Contradictory rumours are in circulation regarding the relations between the Government here and .Soviet Russia, which might alone engage in trade or even finance on uneconomic lines. The Russian Minister went on long leave a couple of months ago and may not return, though he is officially due back in April. He has been temporarily replaced by a non-Moslem from Leningrad, a man of intelligence and I gather some importance in Soviet circles. This gentleman, M. Horace Salkind, is very much out for information, but he cannot go in person to Mecca as the Minister used to do. My impression is that, although the Russians have brought off the coup of selling benzine and petroleum on credit and although there are other Russian goods in the market, e.q., matches, there is little big business doing between the Soviets and the Hejazi Government. 7. The proposal to supplement the reform scheme by employing a European adviser still holds the field. I am told that M. Jacobs, the manager of the Dutch Bank here, now on leave, was offered the post at a salary of £1,000 a year. It was subsequently offered to another Dutchman. It is not yet certain how he has reacted, but the Netherlands Charge d Affaires thinks it unlikely that he will accept, especially as the present idea is said to be to get someone to undertake the reorganisation of the finances without fixed remuneration, but with the prospect of a fat present from the King when he has accomplished his task. 8. Meanwhile, the reform scheme is there for all to see and to study as far as they can do so without any information as to the budget which has reen adopted. 1 he revenue, x, is to be divided into percentages assigned to current expenditure, floating debt, reserve and extraordinary expenditure iiichiding apparently betterment schemes. The new budget is to operate as from the first day of the current lunar month, i.e., about the 9th December. Fromthis it looks as though the large arrears of salaries due on that date were to go into lloatmg debt, not a very practicable arrangement, if it is contemplated, having regard to the penury among officials. 9. 1 take the opportunity of giving some account of the repercussion in the liejaz of the sterling crisis, following on the local currency crisis described in the despatches which 1 wrote in the spring and early summer. It will be remembered that early in the year the Government concentrated its efforts on an attempt to maintain the recognised elements in the local currency at the official rates, viz., £1 gold =10 silver riyals = 220 piastres nickel current, and that this attempt broke down as regards the gold-silver parity, although silver did not slump quite as badly as might have been expected. In my despatch No. 286 of the 14th July, I forwarded a communique defining to some extent the monetary policy on the basis of maintaining the above rates and fixing corresponding rates for other currencies in general use, which were to be still tolerated, including the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee. These decisions produced no effect as against market conditions and the communique is now mainly of historical interest only. When the United Kingdom went off the gold standard, the curious position arose that the Hejaz possessed an official gold currency in the shape of English sovereigns side by side with its own silver. The Hejazi Government were as incapable as most people of understanding the implications of such a situation, much less devising a policy to deal with it. On the 16th October they announced a prohibition of the export of gold, except by permission of the Government (see Mr. Hope Gill 's despatch No. 404 of the 19th October). It was subsequently announced that the authorities empowered to grant permits for the export of gold were the customs authorities and that detailed instructions, which I have not seen, would be issued later. I understand that the principle was to allow gold to leave the country only on a guarantee being given that an equivalent quantity of goods would he imported within three months. Apart from this prohibition, the currency situation was allowed to work itself out under the influence of market conditions. For a time, it was possible in certain transactions, for gold and sterling to be treated as equivalent, but this could obviously be neither general nor lasting. Gold tended to become scarce in the local market. Sterling and Egyptian notes came into increasing use. The respective values, as expressed in riyals, adapted themselves more or less to Fmropean exchange conditions, gold at a high premium and the various paper issues at rates determined by their relation to sterling with slight local variations resulting presumably from demand, supply and native ideas as to the confidence they might inspire. At the time of writing the approximate rates in the bazaars here are as follows :— £ gold = 17^ riyals. £ sterling = 48^r riyals. £ Egyptian = 13 riyals. 19 rupees =£1 gold. 10. I can best complete this account of the currency situation by giving a string of isolated facts, not all of which I can interpret, as follows :— (a) As already stated gold has tended to disappear from the market. This is in part attributed to hoarding. It is possible that some has been sent to Riadh, where the King is believed by some to be accumulating a reserve of treasure. Gold has also been taken off the market by the Dutch Bank, which for several weeks past has been buying. This bank normally sends a shipment of gold to Europe after the pilgrimage. Its present policy of buying may be due to a desire on the part 6f the head office to hold part of their gold reserve in Jedda. Fluid gold is required for various local purposes and the depletion has been sufficiently marked to produce a recent enquiry by a firm here for a quotation for gold sovereigns from abroad delivered in Jedda. . {b) The Soviet Legation here has been selling sterling notes in considerable quantities. The origin of the notes and the object of the Legation are obscure. Fears have been expressed lest the notes should not be all genuine, but I have not heard it seriously suggested so far that any of the notes here have been forged.(c) When the announcement on monetary policy sent home in my abov mentioned despatch No. 286 of the 14th July was made, itVas th~ policy of the Hejazi Government to bolster up the riyal by generalisi ^ its use in other parts of Ibn Sand’s dominions, like Nejd and As?^ though it was not hoped to oust the Maria Theresa dollar at a stroke This policy has been pursued by introducing riyals into Nejd for u*r in out payments, e.g., it was said that Ibn Sand intended to give hi ^ largesse to the tribes this year in Hejazi silver, and a plan was apparently devised for creating in Nejd a network of stalls to retail goods bought or borrowed in the Hejazi towns, the transactions to be effected in riyals only. The latter part of the plan is said to have been defeated by local Nejdi opposition, with the result that the goods had to be stored or sold wholesale. Riyals, though put into circulation in Nejd, are very unpopular there, partly because the merchants complain that they are no use to them in Koweit and Bahrein. Their gold value in Nejd is consequently much lower than in the Hejaz, though information as to the actual rates are conflicting One informant, the pessimist, says that they went some little time ago as low as 30 to the £, with the result, he adds, that the King in his anger confiscated the goods of twelve Riadh merchants and closed down their shops. (d) The Government have stultified their previous policy of trying to keep riyals at 10 to the £ gold by their own recent attitude. Where possible they pay them out at that rate, but they accept them only at their market value in gold. This is perhaps reasonable in the case of telegraph charges, having regard to the necessity for providing for external settlements. The same rule is, however; applied in other cases, notably that of customs duty. Unfortunately for the financial authorities they have not been able to carry to its'logical conclusion their plan of having it both ways, i.e., paying at 10 and collecting at gold rate. In order to clear off debts to certain commercial houses, they have had to agree to take only a portion of the duty on new imports in cash and to allow the remainder to be written off against the debts. Some, at least, of the commercial houses, e.g., Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company, have successfully asserted the principle that, for this purpose, the writing off should be on the basis of £ gold to £ gold, instead of at the customs rate for rivals, which fluctuates round the fluctuating market rate. (e) A curious transaction came to my notice accidentally at Port Sudan. I found that the Hejazi postal authorities had cleared off their debt to the Eastern Telegraph Company up to last May and had subsequently made a single payment which was understood to be on account of the June account. This took the form of a cheque in sterling drawn by Credit Lyonnais, Paris, on Credit Lyonnais, London, on the 26th October last to the order of the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs and endorsed by the latter at Mecca on the 8th December to the Eastern Telegraph Company. I am at a loss to understand how this cheque was bought and can only surmise that it may have something to do with Abdurrahman Qusaibi s activities in Europe. L .

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 11, 1932.) (No. 492.) Sir, Jedda, December SINCE my return to Jedda on the 15th December, I have endeavoured to obtain a general view of the economic and financial situation in this country. Although I can add little to the information already in your possession, I think it worth while to attempt a comprehensive picture of what I find after an absence of five months. In drawing it I have not had the advantage of any contact with high Government circles, for, as you know, the King remains at Riadh and most of his advisers have been summoned thither, including Fuad Bey Hamza, who left Mecca for Nejd almost simultaneously with my arrival in Jedda. The only Hejazi personage of any consequence whom I have seen is the rich old Governor of Jedda. who hardly counts as an official any longer. Though still to some extent employed as a consultant on great occasions, he now concerns himself little with the current affairs of his office, so that his outlook is less that of a Government servant than of a merchant. It is no secret that, as a business man and an important creditor of the Government, he views the situation in the country with anxiety and ill-concealed hostility to the present regime. 2. It is generally agreed that the economic position in the country as a whole could hardly be worse. The merchants in Jedda and Mecca have been increasingly embarrassed during the past two years. Of late, they have had to cope not only with depression in trade, but with Government demands for contributions in I money oi* in kind, extorted ostensibly on loan but without any definite prospect ' of repayment of the money or payment for the goods. Some carry large stocks j (e.y., of rice) owing to over-importation earlier this year and in 1930. Monetary 1 crises elsewhere have created a feeling of uncertainty, the net result of which is to create further depression, although there have been passing effects of a contrary kind, e.y., the abandonment of the gold standard by His Majesty’s Government and consequent depreciation of the rupee gave a temporary fillip to the import trade from India. The prices of most imported goods, reckoned in gold, have risen considerably during my absence, though those of local food-stuffs appear to be fairly steady. 3. I am assured that among the tribes, and especially those in the north of the Hejaz, the utmost misery prevails. It is impossible to sift the information, but it is said that, what with the reaction of world conditions, manifested more particularly in the greatly reduced pilgrimage, and the demands of the Government for military purposes, there has been a great depletion of live-stock. I hear of a reduction in the number of camels and of sheep and goats being sold off at ludicrously small prices. Attention is drawn to the influx of half-starved Bedouin into the larger towns, especially, perhaps, Medina, and to the frequent spectacle of hungry tribesmen collecting at the halts on the main road from Jedda to that place. In August I was inclined to doubt the tales of actual starvation, which, it will be remembered, were related by the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London, among others. Early in September the Mecca newspaper “ Umm-al-Qura,” a Government-inspired organ, thought it worth while to contradict a report of famine in the Hejaz which had been circulated in India. In view of what I now hear, I can no longer disregard the reiterated statements made to me regarding hunger and increased mortality. To give one example, possibly exaggerated, I am told of Bedouin dying in Medina at the rate of thirty-five a day. 4 There is little or no prospect of relief being afforded by the 1932 pilgrimage. Some months ago I thought that the number of overseas pilgrims might attain the 1931 figure of about 40.000, though it was unlikely to exceed it. The Government have exerted themselves to stimulate the flow by propaganda, including the announcement of reduced charges and an almost firm promise that Pilgrimage Day will fall on a Friday. Nevertheless, it now looks as though the [354 1_1]total number of overseas pilgrims may be nearer 20,000 than 40,000. It i s t soon to make definite estimates, as the number of Indians and Egyptians is alwa 0 doubtful up to a very short time before the great day, which should fall on o about the 15th April next year. Up to the present, however, only 2,500 piW;^ have arrived from the Dutch East indies, always first in the field. The Nether lands Legation surmises that this represents about half the total for the seaso which would thus be about 5.000 as compared with about 16,000 this year. n ’ 5. Hopes are still founded on the possible development of new resouro the recently discovered or rediscovered water, petroleum and gold. The American expert, Mr. Twitched, followed the procession of high officials to Riadh on the 15th December. The one concrete result of his efforts so far has been the erection of an undoubtedly fine and happily cheap American windmill at the Waziria wells some miles from Jedda, and some quite useful work on the old conduits connecting them with the town. It seems uncertain whether the water is to be used to supply Jedda or for agricultural purposes. Of the gold and petroleum I know nothing new nor have 1 heard any more of the separate proposal to employ Swedish experts to investigate the petroleum. ^ 6. I turn to the financial situation of the Government. Mr. Hope Gill has kept you very fully informed on this subject in a series of despatches ending with his No. 482 of the 13th December. I need not therefore go into the details of the reform schemes which have been so greatly advertised. The general opinion is that, even if revenue prospects were steadier and even if Ibn Saud had men capable of running a rational financial system, the scheme has come too late. The revenue from direct taxation of pilgrims must necessarily diminish. There must be a further decline in customs revenue owing to the falling off of pilgrims and general depression. In his despatch No. 346 of the 29th August Mr. Hope Gill gave figures from a well-informed source showing that the customs receipts had fallen from nearly £1,200,000 in the lunar year ending about the 8th June, 1929, to less than £900,000 in that ending about the 18th May, 1931 One of my more pessimistic informants puts the figure as low as £400,000 this year. This may be an underestimate, but 1 doubt whether a customs revenue of more than half a million can be counted on for the year ending next May. The customs receipts, such as they are, might be used as security for a foreign loan, but only if the lenders could rely on some more or less independent control being established and on a greater prospect of durability than the Saudian regime at present offers. As you are aware, the negotiations with the Dutch Bank broke down and there seems to be no longer any likelihood of a loan being obtained from any European source on commercial lines. Contradictory rumours are in circulation regarding the relations between the Government here and Soviet Russia, which might alone engage in trade or even finance on uneconomic lines. Ihe Russian Minister went on long leave a couple of months ago and may not return, though he is officially due back in April. He has been temporarily replaced by a non-Moslem from Leningrad, a man of intelligence and I gather some importance in Soviet circles. This gentleman, M. Horace Salkind, is very much out for information, but he cannot go in person to Mecca as the Minister used to do. My impression is that, although the Russians have brought off the coup of selling benzine and petroleum on credit and although there are other Russian goods in the market, e.g., matches, there is little big business doing between the Soviets and the Hejazi Government. 7. The proposal to supplement the reform scheme by employing a European adviser still holds the field. I am told that M. Jacobs, the manager of the Dutch Bank here, now on leave, was offered the post at a salary of £1,000 a year. It was subsequently, offered to another Dutchman. It is not yet certain how he has reacted, but the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires thinks it unlikely that he will accept, especially as the present idea is said to be to get someone to undertake the reorganisation of the finances without fixed remuneration, but with the prospect of a fat present from the Kins? when he has accomplished his task. 8. Meanwhile, the reform scheme is there for all to see and to stud) as far as they can do so without any information as to the budget which has been adopted. I he revenue, x, is to be divided into percentages assigned to current expenditure, floating debt, reserve and extraordinary^ expenditure including apparently betterment schemes. The new budget is to operate as froiu the first day of the current lunar month, i.e., about the 9th December. Fromi 3 \ t!iis it looks ?is though the large arrears ot salaries due.on that date were to go into floating deot, not a very practicable arrangement, if it is contemplated, having regard to the penury among officials. 9. I take the opportunity of giving some account of the repercussion in the iiejaz of the sterling crisis, following on the local currency crisis described in the despatches which I wrote in the spring and early summer. It will be remembered that early in the year the Government concentrated its efiorts on an attempt to maintain the recognised elements in the local currency at the official rates, viz., £1 gold = 10 silver riyals = 220 piastres nickel current, and that this attempt broke down as regards the gold-silver parity, although silver did not slump quite as badly as might have been expected. * In my despatch No. 286 of the 14th July, I forwarded a communique defining to some extent the monetary policy on the basis of maintaining the above rates and fixing corresponding rates for other currencies in general use. which were to be still tolerated, including the Maria Theresa, dollar and the rupee These decisions produced no effect as against market conditions and the communique is now mainly of historical interest only. When the Lnited Kingdom went off the gold standard, the curious position arose that the Hejaz possessed an official gold currency in the shape of English sovereigns side by side with its own silver. The Hejazi Government were as incapable as most people of understanding the implications of such a situation, much less devising a policy to deal with it. On the 16th October they announced a prohibition of the export of gold, except by permission of the Government (see Mr. Hope Gill's despatch No. 404 of the 19th October). It was subsequently announced that the authorities empowered to grant permits for the export of gold were the customs authorities and that detailed instructions, which I have not seen, would be issued later. I understand that the principle was to allow gold to leave the country only on a guarantee being given that an equivalent quantity of goods would be imported within three months. Apart from this prohibition, the currency situation was allowed to work itself out under the influence of market conditions. For a time, it was possible in certain transactions, for gold and sterling to be treated as equivalent, but this could obviously be neither general nor lasting. Gold tended to become scarce in the local market. Sterling and Egyptian notes came into increasing use. The respective values, as expressed in riyals, adapted themselves more or less to European exchange conditions, gold at a high premium and the various paper issues at rates determined by their relation to sterling with slight local variations resulting presumably from demand, supply and native ideas as to the confidence they might inspire. At the time of writing the approximate rates in the bazaars here are as follows :— £ gold = 17^ rivals. £ sterlings 18| riyals. 2 £ Egyptian = 13 riyals. 19 rupees=£l gold. P-2. 10. I can best complete this account of the currency situation by giving a string of isolated facts, not all of which I can interpret, as follows :— (a) As already stated gold has tended to disappear from the market. This is in part attributed to hoarding. It is possible that some has been sent to Riadh, where the King is believed by some to be accumulating a reserve of treasure. Gold has also been taken off the market by the Dutch Bank, which for several weeks past has been buying. This bank normally sends a shipment of gold to Europe after the pilgrimage. Its present policy of buying may be due to a desire on the part of the head office to hold part of their gold reserve in Jedda. Fluid gold is required for various local purposes and the depletion has been sufficiently marked to produce a recent enquiry by a firm here for a quotation for gold sovereigns from abroad delivered in Jedda. th) The Soviet Legation here has been selling sterling notes in considerable quantities. The origin of the notes and the object of the Legation are obscure. Fears have been expressed lest the notes should not be all genuine, but I have not heard it seriously suggested so far that any of the notes here have been forged.I (c) When the announcement on monetary policy sent home in my above mentioned despatch No. 286 of the 14th July was made, it w as the policy of the Hejazi Government to bolster up the riyal by generalising its use in other parts of Ibn Sand s dominions, like Nejd and Asn though it was not hoped to oust the Maria 1 heresa dollar at a stroke* This policy has been pursued by introducing riyals into Nejd for use in out payments, e.g., it was said that Ibn Sand intended to give his largesse to the tribes this year in Hejazi silver, and a plan was apparently devised for creating in Nejd a network of stalls to retail goods bought or borrowed in the Hejazi towns, the transactions to be effected in riyals only.

(e) A curious transaction came to my notice accidentally at Port Sudan. I found that the Hejazi postal authorities had cleared off their debt to the Eastern Telegraph Company up to last May and had subsequently made a single payment which was understood to be on account of the June account. This took the form of a cheque in sterling drawn by Credit Lyonnais, Paris, on Credit Lyonnais, London, on the 26th October last to the order of the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs and endorsed by the latter at Mecca on the 8th December to the Eastern Telegraph Company.

The second half of last month and the twenty days which have elapsed of this month have been full of great deeds, which should he registered in golden letters on the forehead of the age in favour of His Majesty who is sitting on the throne; they should he added to his noble deeds and great services to this country, which has tasted no comfort and prosperity for ages, except during his happy golden days. Readers must have learnt of the substance of these improve ments, for which gracious Royal Orders have been issued, from f the publications made in recent issues of this paper, and have s read in the front page of one of those issues, the Royal Proc lamation which contained the wise political plan which His Majesty has determined to get his Government to follow at this critical and dreadful crisis. We have already mentioned since the publication of the Proclamation, the improvements made and introduced into the various Government Departments, which will secure the running of affairs in good order, the maintenance of the rights of the people and the treasury and the care and bet tering of the state of visitors to this country. We are not in much need of malting any further explanation, for the publica tions we have made speak for themselves of the memorable and everlasting deeds of the redeemed King. We however think it useful to display the splendid action and the expected good con sequences of general prosperity and great improvement. We said that the last few weeks have been full of glorious deeds,deeds, and we arc not exaggerating in our statement, ’because suck , cA a period can certainly be account*#*?? as one separating two epochs# The former closed with its g ood and evil actions, as well as all the other great improvements which Hie Majesty had been personally looking after; the latter opened the door of a new flowering and shining time, wliich we hope will be full of prosperity and all the success we desire in this world and progress in the next# The first of the new ijuprovements that can be displayed, and which His Majesty has ordered to be carried out, is the improve ment he has introduced into the Central Government, so that it may become a Government able to bear the burdens of its Governmental duties for the welfare of the nation, the Government and the coun try# The most important aspect of this improvement is that of the personal and joint responsibility of the principal Government officials# The Government in the past has lacked such responsibi lity# It has been found that the laying of responsibility on r people individually and jointly and their co-operation in bearing the burdens of Government will bring forth welfare and avoid much harm# His Majesty has therefore issued his orders for the const!-, tution of a 'Majlis al WutalV* (Council of Under-Secretaries or *»*'- Ministers) under the presidency of His Highness the Viceroy and consisting of the Under-Ueoretariea of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Interior and Legislation to supervise the affaire of the country and to run them in their various directions within the scope and the defined capacities decided upon in accordance with the Loyal orders# Members of the Council are held responsible jointly for the actions to be taken by them# A detailed regulation in which this responsibility and these capacities will be defined is going to be drawn up# The next item of the series of new improvements ia t,uc gracious decree of establishing the budget of the country on a firm basisand in ouch a manner that the revenue and ea^penditure are checked, and calculation hao been made tentatively, cm good authority, for any possible deficiency in the income* The budget has aeon es tablished on this sound baais, and thus both s ides, income and expenditure, have become eq[ual. This fact is one of the utmost importance to the Government and the country* The third item is the checking of the Government f a claims and liabilities and the taking of decisive action for the collection of the former and the settlement of the latter at their fixed times* A special share of the revenues of the Government has been allotted for these debts, as is pointed out in the gracious Royal Proclamation, and it is hoped that such liabilities will be settled in due course by the budget referred to* The fourth matter which should be counted as of the utmost and deepest importance as far as the recent improvements are concerned, is the checking of the revenues of the Government and the bringing of them under one administration and the placing of the new adminis tration, which has been called the General Treasury, under a firm regulation unlikely to be broken* The revenues have been divided up and defined in the gracious Proclamation* The proportions of the divisions have been fixed in the same unchangeable manner. Generally speaking, steps to ensure that no infraction of the decreed regulation will be committed have been taken and arrange ments have been made with a view to carrying out the regulation in the most careful manner* ijaong the improvements referred to is mentioned the revision of the allowances of the various Government Departments and the reduction of certain unnecessary ones in a reasonable proportion, which has resulted in the saving of a considerable amount of money from the original allowances in the general budget of the country. These iapwovements in general point to the whichwhich His Uajesty drives and the wise policy by which he directs the endeavours of his Oovernaient, keeping pace with the spirit of improvement and the essential development which circumstances IjiK* necessitate^ shall ^ place gradually and not at such a pace as the Government might not be able to stand# 2he action now taken by his Majesty is not the first proof which His Majesty has given of his Islamic sincerity, his Arabic seal and his devotion to the service of his nation and people, but what he has done now are parts of a series of great improve ments which he has undertaken to realise for the service of this country, the reconditioning of its affairs and its restoration to its former dignity and honour. Ills Majesty has not only given proof to this effect by his action, but he has also discharged his conscience of his obligsH tions towards his religion and nation, and has given a high example of devotion to the cause of reformation, zeal for the general interest, and desire for success# May God help to success and guide in the right path#t I J J mAHSLASPXOK OP SX^HACT BiQM 'UMJi-AX^gOHA 0 110.364 DuVTSD DIXJKMBKU 4th, 1931 (24/7/1350).

The King poses as having obeyed the call of duty. In reality he has disobeyed it for months. He states that he took: the initiative in informing himself of the whole altuat* ion. In reality it was his second son, egged on by his Under Secretary #or Foreign Affairs, no doubt stimulated in his turn by Mr.Philby's and his own personal animosity ^ towards his financial ooftleague, who spurred his Majesty \ into belatfcd activity by forcing upon him a great deal of unpalatable information. Ibn Ba’Hd states that the infor mation was submitted through the Minister, more properly Director-Oeneral, of Finance. In reality it accompanied him to Rifidh as unwelcome evidence of his guilt, which he has evidently failed to disprove. Towards the end of his letter the King informs his people that he has Kept his Finance Minister at Ri&amp;dh in the interests of the finances of Hejd; his people Know better, or thihfc they do. They do not believe that Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman will be relea- sed for a lone Mme, but Fuad Bey Hamza Has told me that It Is only too true that he will soon return. He, with Yflsuf The opening phrases are somewhat misleading. Yasln, is mating the moat of ’Ahdullah Suleyman'a absence. His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I was aaJced to call at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs here on the 13th Koreaber to meet Sheykh Ydsuf Yasln who had arrived post-haste from ftlfidh overnight* The glad news of reform was broken to ae 9 followed by the less gratify ing news of a virtual moratorium on all Government debts, internal and external, and rounded off by an invitation to Uis Majesty’s Government to stand on a footing of equality with all^creditors in the matter of the 1929 debt to the Government of India* devoted to funding these debts, how much it would amount to, and what period was calculated to be necessary for the liquid ation of the current indebtedness* Ctoly in the matter of proportion were any figures available. The total revenues, it appears, are to be classified under four headings to meet four main objects, as follows:- (1) Official salaries, thirty five per cent. This was ex plained to me as covering all the normal costs of adminis tration* (2) Indebtedness, twenty five per cent* This was to cover all arrears of salaries as well as the internal and external debt of the Hejazi Government. (3) Reserve, fifteen per cent. This is a notable novelty which will have all the attraction of a pot of honey. (4) Extraordinary expenses, twenty five per cent. This la intended to ensure the comfort and health of pilgrims and tc develop the country*s hidden resources. 5 # As regards approximate figures, I could be giver no information. Much spade-work remaineJto be done. Rut as regards the length of time which it would take to pay off current debts, Fuad Bey informed me — Ytlsuf Yasin having by then I enquired what part of the revenue was to bethen jone to say hi® prayer® «* that they calculated it at about two year®* In reporting the matter to you in ay tele gram under reference t I therefore suggested that the concur rence of Hla Majesty's Government with this still further postponed repayment of the Government of India debt might be made conditional on the production of a satisfactory budget estimate* 6* 1 have already reported in the same telegram the Hejaai Government's attitude towards toe other outstan ding British credits, namely toe costs of toe MacBonnell investigation, toe account with the Eastern Telegraph Company and toe two classes of debts owing to Messrs Gellatly hankey and Company (Sudan) Limited* I have as yet nothing more to add* 7* Sheykh Ydsuf Yasln and Fuad Bey Hamza spent two busy days in negotiation with toe Government's other creditors in ^edda* I fear that they have gone too fast* A great diversity of categories of indebtedness and condit ions of security and treatment has been brought to light but nothing has been reduced to writing and toe Sheykh and the Bey have now returned to Mecca with views and Intentions which undoubtedly conflict with toe impressions they have left behind them with the creditors here* g # One further point of interest has emerged* It is intended to make Jedda toe chief centre of financial con trol and hopes are still entertained of securing toe services of a Dutchman as financial adviser* My Butch colleague seems leas hopeful* The reform, in short, is late, perhaps too late inIn tiat,dra»tto In t]:i®ory t and reducible in practice to the low levels of local diligence and integrity. uoreover it is not obvious how Ibn Oa'Qd himself will live, unless he lives on tli« salaries of his officials, the funded debts, the pll- i ^ u.ak I O *- grlaa, or the rose .ve.

November 2nd, 1931. My Lord f The l&amp;at ten days have seen the final develop ment of a serious split in the Hejazi Government. The Director-General of Finance, who has for some months been the virtual Dictator of the Hejaz, has been denounced in unison by the remainder of the M Government rt and has been summoned by the King to Hiadh. 2. I think: it was Mr. ^hilby^ return from idadh in the middle of October which brought matters to a head. He was infuriated by the Finance department’s theft of his benzine stoclcs and found his own financial position worse than he had thought. He at once wrote to tell heykh •Abdullah Suleyman just what he thought of him and his financial policy, reminding him amongst other things that the price of theft in this country was the loss of a hand, and stating that on this basis he deserved to be chopped into little pieces. He also sent to Ibn ia’&amp;d a formal and detailed denunciation of * bdullah buleyman and all hie ways. He then returned to Taif# 3. There he found the Amtr Feysal, Fuad Bey Hamza, and the two brothers Fadhl already putting their heads together in search of &amp; way to break down Sheyfch ’ bdullah uleyman’s position. They were all victims of his nower, In that they were not only completely overshadowed by him in all brances of government, but were also Stt ired by him of fund*. The Viceroy had had to postpone the Bummer removal of hie Diwan and household to Taif for is M Jeety's '■rincloal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.lack of cash • Fuad Bey has received no salary for 8 months and has since told me that he has long been ashamed to demand work from his personnel in the Foreign Affairs department, who have also received no pay for months. 4. Under the stimulus, no doubt, of Mr. Philby’s openly declared hostility to ’Abdullah Suleyman, these four drew up a lengthy memorandum to the King. Mr. Philby tells me that it was an ultimatum, tendering the resignation of Viceroy and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Chief of the Viceregal Dlwan (Ibrahim al Fadhl) , and Vice-President of the Legislative Assembly (his half-brother ’Abdullah al Fadhl), unless the Director- General of Finance were removed from his post. ’Abdullah al Fadhl left with this document for Hiadh on the 25rd., October together with Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman. It was mooted that Fuad Bey should follow them on the 24th., but he declined to go without the Amir Feysal, who also prefer red to remain. The King’s reaction is still anxiously awaited. 5. Fuad Bey came to Je&amp;da on the 29th October, after having been recalled to Taif to answer some point of detail on which Ibn Sa’Gd sought information. I had a long informal talk with him on the evening of the 31st. It proved a little difficult at first to draw him but he even tually gave me the whole story. The memorandum is apparen tly not an ultimatum but a series of constructive proposals designed to achieve the two objects which Puad Bey states he has pressed upon the Xing ever since his return in the spring, namely the crawing up and publication of a budget and the establishment of a Government on the basis of ,f the collectiveV collective and individual res wieibility of Mini8ter8 ,, . ’Abdullah Suleyiaan, he said, had been invited to subscribe to this document but had refused. 6. Fuad Bey seemed very doubtful as to whether any useful reeult would flow from the King’s deliberations. He spoke with bitterness of ’Abdullah Suleyman’s hold over Xbn Sa’&amp;d and wished that the King would return to Mecca and thresh the matter out. He feared that he would not, but that things would drift on from bad to worse. They had lost all confidence in themselves, he said, and I think he was on the point of saying that they had lost all confi dence in the King, when he changed the subject.

My Lord, VIth reference to my despatch No. 419 of the 2nd of November, in which I reported on the solit which haa occurred in the Hejaz-Nejd Government, I have the honour to inform Your Lordship that Ibn ba’ftd does not appear to have taken any decision in the matter. The Director-General of Finance is still at Pi$dhu Orders emanating from there have recently been circulated to all finance officials in the Hejaz instructing them to lock up their tills and to make no payments of any kind, but these orders were neither issued through nor even communicated to the Viceroy and the rest of the '‘Government’* here. As a resulf of the King's long silence and this evidence of tJheykh ’Abdullah uuleyman’s continued disregard of his colleagues, the first feelings of nervous optimism entertained by Fuad Bey Hamza and his party are now giving way to a sense of futility and despair. 2. The Governor of Jedda and Director of Customs have protested telegraphically against the suspension of payments, but without result. ousoension of work trill no doubt follow. I have, etc., (id.) C.G.

October 13, 1931 CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 5141/1600/25] No. 1 . Mr. Hope-Gill to the Marquess of Reading.—{Received October 13.) (No. 375.) My Lord, Jedda, September 30, 1931. 1 HAVE the honour to report that Mr. Philby, or rather Hajji Abdullah St. John Philby, has returned unexpectedly from feiadh, and in the course of several conversations has given me some interesting sidelights on the internal situation in this country. 2. There seems little doubt but that Ibn Saud and he get badly on each other's nerves. He left with all his baggage and instruments in two cars running on a three-quarter paraffin mixture. In full desert they ran out of even this modest admixture of benzine, and Mr. Philby subsisted on dates and insufficient water until relief came from Taif. Arrived there, he learned of the misappropriation of the whole of the Standard Oil Company’s benzine stock at Jedda, for which he is agent. Although he pretended on his arrival here that the seizure was the result of previous arrangement by him with the Director-General of Finance, he confessed to me last night that he had been faced with a fait accompli and that all he could do w T as to write it up with the other debts owing to him by the Hejazi Government. These, he said, now amount to some £50,000, £12,000 of which represent the value of this and previous consignments from Standard Oil. He holds no drafts on customs nor even promissory notes. If the Government swims he hopes eventually to be paid. If it sinks, he fears that he must sink with it. He has staked his all on Ibn Saud. 3. This makes it all the more striking that he should criticise him so unfavourably to a third person. He describes the King as disheartened in spirit, disillusioned in mind, and approaching impotence in body. This last discomfort seems to poison his whole outlook, so that he has become morose and reticent, withdrawing himself for the greater part of the day into the quarters outside Riadh, where he keeps his slaves and concubines, spending long nights with one or other of his wives, and only finding relaxation between whiles in the company of a few Bedouin cronies where the talk is of women and camels. Although he used even in Riadh to devote anything up to ten hours a day to current affairs, he seems now to have lost all interest in them and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin moons about with nothing to do. These activities and this indolence indicate to Mr. Philby that Ibn Saud, in the fifty-first year of a strenuous sexual career, has reached a stage of conflict between desire and its fulfilment. The male climacteric, maybe. n 4 . He also has discovered, to his intense disappointment, that the King lies to him, not out of malice, he thinks, but because his moral fibre has weakened and he no longer holds a strict regard for truth. He instances the misappropriation of his benzine, with which he is convinced Ibn Saud was fully conversant. As another instance, he states that Ibn Saud told him that M. Boucicault had com pleted one wireless station north of Medina and was moving on to the next. Mr. Philby now learns that M. Boucicault has, until quite recently, again been held up by lack of benzine for his convoy, this time at Al Ula, whence he had been insistentlv telegraphing for supplies, and that he was only now able to move on to Tabuk to begin work on the first station. The Marconi payments, incidentally, are four months in arrear. . . . ^ 5 Mr • Philby’s sidelights on the Yemen trouble are illuminating. He was with the King and Yusuf Yasin when the news of Imamic encroachment was received. They pored over large-scale maps and Mr. Philby pointed out that Arwa, the village reported as occupied, apparently lay on the Yemen side of the Jebel Razih wiitershed. Ibn Saud would have none of it and for some days while waiting for further news he pondered plans for a sweeping desert attack on Sana from the north-east. Mr. Philby was doing his best to show that there was no casus belli, but he gained the firm impression that Ibn Saud was intending to attack the Imam at all costs—a providential means, he added, of employing a [27 3 n- -212 host of hungry Bedouin who hung round Riadh and complained of taxation— when he suddenly changed his attitude and became conciliatory. laskedMr.Philby h.ter on whether, if such a juncture were to occur again, a friendly word from us would have any value; he replied that it would undoubtedly be deeply resented He is evidently less than ever in the King’s confidence. I must report, in this connexion, that at the end of our conversation of the 19th September Fuad Hamza made a point of telling me how grateful Ibn Saud had been for His Majesty’s Government’s friendlv gesture of advice. 6 . Mr. Philby lias spoken much of the King, but 'what I have written summarises his views sufficiently for the purpose of this report. He also spoke of Fuad Bey as having now lost such influence as he had. He pictures him at Taif as withdrawn from contact with current affairs of State and spending his time in writing a handbook on the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies. My own impression is that he knows much less than formerly of what is passing and that his office has largely become a letter-box for receiving and despatching to the “competent authorities ' the correspondence of the foreign representatives. The French vice-consul, who had to transact all the current business for his hermit Charge d’Affaires on the occasion of the Amir Feisal’s recent visit to Jedda, found Fuad Bey ready to discuss the attractions of the post of Minister at Paris. I think that M Durmarcay initiated this subject, a point which may have significance of another kind. 7. Mr. Philby confirmed my growing conviction that the Director-General of Finance is now for all practical purposes “ the Hejazi Government.” He still has the King's blind confidence. He moves about the central Hejaz, the only moving point and the sole motive force in an area of complete stagnation, collecting means from the merchants in cash or kind and disposing of it none knows how. Holding the purse-strings, he controls everything except the “ Umm-al-Qura,” which he has tried to capture but failed in face of the “ Syrian party,” which still has enough means to produce the paper. An essential department which Abdullah Suleiman is said to be deliberately starving is the Post and Telegraphs. In spite of the Finance Department’s hauls of benzine, the Jedda-Mecca-Taif mails have now for a fortnight been carried by donkeys. The Eastern Telegraph Company's account is mounting up and nothing has been paid since the end of May. It is Mr. Philby’s opinion that, for all his secretive activity, Abdullah Suleiman is near the end of his tether and cannot reach the beginning of the pilgrimage season. I learn that he is shortly going to Riadh. 8 . If he goes, the Hejaz will lapse into a state of anarchic torpor under the figure-headship of the Viceroy. The urban populations will sit with fatalistic eyes turned towards a pilgrimage which they know will be minimum. The only movement which may be expected is from soldiery and police who, lacking pay wherewith to buy food, have the power to take it. I have, &amp;c. C. G.

Mr. Hope-Gill to the Marquess of Reading.—(Received September 29.) (No. 361.) My Lord, ^ Jedda, September 9 , 1931. I 100K occasion of the recent visit of the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs to Jedda to ask him what he could tell me about the benzine contract, which his finance colleague was supposed to have signed with the Soviet Legation. His face fell, his manner lost its habitual assurance, and he retired into 1928 to gain time. He reminded me that in that year Ibn Saud had instructed him to broach with Mr. Bird, the subject of fostering British trade with the Hejaz as an offset to the Soviet attempts to break into the closed Hejazi market. Yes, I said, a favourable commercial treaty was sought as a quid pro quo. No, he said, he had been misunderstood, more than that had been hoped for; but he did not specify what. Instead, he passed on to expatiate on the brave show that the King had put up against Soviet pressure, unaided and alone, until circumstances had at last become too strong for him. (Here 1 reminded him that the show was made not so much for our bright eyes as for the black looks of the Nejdi brethren and the Hejazi tradesmen at the mere mention of bolshevism and Soviet goods. He gave me right—up to a point.) 2 . At last, however, His Majesty had been forced to yield in one particular ' to the Soviet pressure. Unable to make a satisfactory contract on the one side j for State fuel needs, and threatened on the other,by the withdrawal of the Soviet Legation from Jedda, his Ministers had made the best of a bad job and contracted , to buy £30,000 worth of Russian benzine, and on very favourable terms too. I suggested that they had been both bluffed and led into the way of further concession. He admitted the first as a possibility, but denied hotly that any further concession was possible When I reminded him that in spite of the total denial of entry to Russian goods, Russian matches were sold openly everywhere and Russian cement was not unknown, he made the curious statement that it was quite true that the prohibition was enforced and that at the same time there w r as a four- ! fold duty on all Russian goods—a position easily understood in Jedda. He then said frankly that the financial situation was rotten, but he did not think it was hopeless. He himself had received no salary since March. 3. I have since received sidelights on the benzine contract from Herr de Haas, the German trading consul. He has recently returned from leave, having spent a month of it in Moscow haggling with the Soviet authorities for the right to run their contract on a commission basis. Under pressure of his threat to undercut them with still cheaper Roumanian oil, they played him wdth long negotiations up to the point of agreement, which they then refused; having in the meantime succeeded in securing their contract in Jedda, by negotiation with the Hejazi Government through their Minister. So keen were they to have it signed before Herr de Flaas could return to Jedda to seduce Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman with his yet cheaper Roumanian oil, that tw T o commercial plenipotentiaries arrived here with the same object. Comrade Jurgieff, representing Wosgostveg (Eastern Trading Society), came up from the south from Hodeida, and shortly afterwards Comrade Hertig (or Gertig), of Sojusneftiexport (Soviet Naphtha Export, a branch of Sojusneftsyndikat), arrived hot-foot from Europe. I understand that the exact terms of the contract are the purchase by the Hejazi Government of 60,000 8 -gallon cases of benzine at 6 s. 6 J. a case c.i.f., and 40,000 8 -gallon cases of kerosene at 5 s. 3J. a case c.i.f., their total cost of £30,000 to be paid in four equal instalments at two-month intervals, the first quarter to be paid on delivery. This is now expected shortly. 4. I'learn that in anticipation of the delivery, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman has already concluded an advance sale in Mecca of 2,000 cases of benzine at £1 apiece. This is the normal market price in the Hejaz, and show r s a clear profit to the sheikh’s treasury of 200 per cent., with the added benefit of cash down against an unmatured debt. It is surprising that the Hejazis have not fallen sooner to such [246 ff—1]a lure Their inherent aversion to bolshevism, their interested stand against Soviet trade, and M. Turakulov’s persistent efforts to obtain further concessions have probably been the main factors of delay. 5 i n Jedda a humbler method obtains for raising the wind. The merchants having now been relieved, on loan, of nearly all f| iei r cash, are required to lend their stock-in-trade to the local tieasury official, tie thereupon knocks it down at auction for what it will fetch, spot cash. I. am assured that this means was resorted to in order to pay for the official dinner with which the Finance Minister was greeted on his recent return from Medina. Little wonder that the local tradesmen feel sore, so sore that even the venerable Governor of Jedda, himself a merchant who has been heavily dunned for loans, hailed the Indian vice- consul in full market the other day and asked him how he could evade further extortion. As the Governor is very deaf, the Munshi was much embarrassed for re plv 6 . With regard to expenditure, I hear through a credible channel that Ibn r Baud is no whit less extravagant than before, and that observers at Riadh are shocked at his lavish hunting parties. His Minister in London, on the other hand has recently been telegraphing for funds. The arrangement with Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Co. for the supply of credit to cover the needs of missions abroad (Sir A. Ryan’s despatch No. 291 of the 16th July) was not concluded after all but I learn confidentially from the manager of the local Dutch bank that the Finance Minister succeeded during the last week of August in collecting £300, which the bank remitted to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba.

They consequently completed during the night of September 12th theft of 13,000 pounds worth of benzine from Gellatly Hankey and Company Limited &lt; comprising the firm’s whole stock in goverment warehouse.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 4167/1600/25] No. 6918 August 12, 1931. Section 4 . » Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—{Received August 12.) (No. 280.) ^ t.xMHli ^ ir ’ Jedda, July 12, 1931. Irsl my despatch No. 200 of the 28th May I attempted to review the general situation in this country with special reference to the Hejaz as distinct from Nejd and its dependencies. Now that Ibn Saud has gone to Riadh and I myself am about to go on leave, I should like to bring the review up to date. 2. It is generally felt that the King, having concentrated his attention on the affairs of the Hejaz for over a year, his first prolonged stay in this part of his dominions since he completed his conquest of it, has left those affairs in a hopeless mess. It is even suggested by some that he has run away from them. I under stand that the situation has given rise to extravagant rumours abroad, one of them being that His Majesty had decided to abdicate in favour of his son Feisal, presumably in the Hejaz, of which that Prince is Viceroy, or in favour of both his elder sons, Saud and Feisal. A report in the latter sense, published in a Cairo newspaper, was formally contradicted in the Umm-al-Qura ” of the 10th July. 3. The feeling one has at present is a sense, not of greater apparent trouble than in May, but of a lack of central direction. The Hejaz has been left like a waterlogged and half-dismantled ship without any particular signs of a wind to blow it either into port or to destruction. It is hard to say who is governing the country. The King is too far away and probably too fed up not to be glad of a rest from the Hejaz. The young Viceroy has been too much in the background of late to make it possible to judge of his capacity for affairs. Among the ‘‘statesmen” the two most important factors are Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who is strong, and Fuad Bey Hamza, who is active and industrious. It remains to be seen whether this not very happily assorted triumvirate can carry on until next pilgrimage. 4. I can add nothing to what I said in paragraph 3 of my despatch under reference regarding the situation in the interior. There is the same anxiety about it in the towns. The same rumours float about, occasionally perhaps a little more precise, but usually fantastic. In the imagination of the quidnuncs of Mecca and Jedda, Jauf “falls” periodically, no one knows into whose hands. A recent rumour has filled the lacuna in the case of Tebuk, which was said to have fallen “to the rebels.” 5. In paragraph 4 of my previous despatch I referred to the King’s religious position. There has been an interesting development in this connexion. It became known towards the end of June that he had made concessions to his extremists. He allowed to be published in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 26th June a long remonstrance addressed to him by the Ulema of Nejd regarding the repetition this year of the Accession Day celebrations instituted in January 1930. The writers claimed politely but firmly that it was their right and duty to call the King’s attention to the irreligiousness of celebrations, which they had condoned in 1930 as there might be political reasons for them, but the perpetuation of which could not be tolerated. The King’s reply, which was also published, expressed his delight at being thus counselled. He deferred to the judgment of the ulema, and asked the forgiveness of God for his offence. 6. About the same time steps were taken to tighten up the regulations against vicious practices, like abstention from prayer, the public use or sale of tobacco (the importation of which is nevertheless still tolerated) and the use ol gramophones, &amp;c. These regulations had been considerably relaxed and the special courts or committees for the enforcement of them had disappeared, ihese have now been reconstituted, and the task of enforcing the restrictions has been divided between them and the civil authorities. Stocks of gramophone needles were seized, and it is said that they can now only be bought from the police; but I will not vouch for this libel on the public service of a friendly Power. It is too soon to say whether the recent measures mark a definite change of poke} [219 m—4]2 towards Wahhabi extremism and a stronger imposition of Nejd on the Hejaz, or whether they were merely adopted to create a good atmosphere for the King’s stay at Riadh. His Majesty made some very pious speeches before he left Mecca on the 28th June, but there is nothing unusual in that. . 7 1 have dealt in separate despatches with the hnancial situation and proceedings of the Nationalist Conference I need not dwell on them further here except to mention one side effect of the financial and economic difficulties ft which may have some political importance. The King was casting about in many ,! directions before he left with a view to raising the wind in foreign quarters. Tht Soviet representative seems to have taken a hand in the game, and is reported to have sold 50 000 cans of benzine to the Government on easy terms. More than this cannot be affirmed, but M. Turakulov’s deal has naturally given rise to rumours that the Hejazi Government have come to terms with the Bolsheviks on a more extensive basis. I am asking Mr. Hope-Gill to watch for any develop ments in this direction, though at present I see no evidence of more than a commercial transaction, and doubt whether there is much to come of it. 8.

Jedda, July 12, 1931. — I have been unable hitherto to follow up my despatch No. 217 of the 9th June with a further report on the Hejazi -- 1 Conference.” T ' T ’ 11 — -- 1 —-- 11 - - Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received August 12.) (No. 279.) Sir, I REGRET that le 9th June with a further report on the Hejazi ‘“National 1 I will now attempt to sum up as briefly as possible the main points in the accounts given in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” of'the 5th, 12th and 19th June. That newspaper has of late become so garrulous that a severe sifting is necessary. 2. As I stated in my previous despatch, the conference assembled at Muna on the 2nd June, but moved next day to Mecca. It sat until the 11th June, when the King gave another banquet to mark the close of the proceedings and received, after dinner, the report. 3. I have still seen no organic statute of any kind defining the constitutional character and electoral basis of the conference. The “Umm-al-Qura” of the 5th June published, however, a regulation determining its internal organisation and the scope of its labours. The most interesting clauses in this are those relative to the three committees mentioned in my previous despatch. 4. The report published in the “Umm-al-Qura does not describe very precisely the conclusions of the Committee on Public Morals, which also dealt with pilgrimage matters. It merely indicates in general terms that recommenda tions were made as to the means of promoting Islamic morality and that regula tions were proposed in connexion with the pilgrimage, notably with reference to complaints made against mutawwifs and their agents. The paper states that these recommendations were to be submitted by the King to the ulema and the Legislative Council respectively. 5. The Committee on Judicial Affairs dealt with two main subjects, one apparently having to do with the general functioning of the courts, the other with the rapid and final disposal of all cases now pending in them. The conference adopted a regulation in forty-two articles prepared by the committee under the first of these heads. This also is to be submitted to the ulema. It was suggested that the review of all pending cases should be entrusted to four ulema, whose names were submitted to the King. . . 6. The Committee on Economic and General Affairs is described as having been much the largest of the three committees. The “ Umm-al-Qura’ gives a long though apparently not complete, list of the subjects which it discussed with a view to their further consideration by the Government. The list is impressive, but the headings are very general. The subjects include the question whether it is a good thing to have few or many motor cars; the granting of concessions; the employment of experts in finance and agriculture; financial reform genera y, banking arrangements, including the possibility of a national bank ; the m re duction into general use throughout Ibn Saud’s dominions of the Hepazi currency and the gradual elimination of the Maria Theresa dollar ; agricultural develop ment and mining; the despatch of a mission abroad to be trained in economic questions; the creation of an agricultural company and another for dealing hides and making yarns; road improvements and railway commumc^ions, electric lighting- payment of salaries and inspection of public departments, wakfs including efforts to secure the revenue of wakls created abroad for e “ 0 in1m/ress^ C Ust, as I have said, even though I have condemned it and omitted some of the items. The “ Umm-al-Qura suggests the picture of a hive Chappy andfntelligent bees engaged in living; up to what they themselves said in their address to the King, when commending ‘*8 ... f uture f u ][ 0 f freely-elected Assembly: “The nation is made o ' test crowned the dreams of the great ancient Arabs, in this, the time of the greatest crowned Arab who has appeared in Arabia. [219 m—2]8. Accounts from private sources show the conference in a less happy It undoubtedly focussed attention on a great many matters of public interest and if certain of the suggestions put forward were acted on, good would result. The questions of mutawwifs, for instance, would appear to ha\e given rise to considerable discussion, and at least one useful proposal seems to have emerged namely that they should cease to be used for the purpose of collecting Government taxation (see paragraph 57 of the pilgrimage report for 1930). On the othei 4 hand some of the suggestions made in this connexion might, if adopted, tend strengthen the hold of the mutawwifs on pilgrims. 9. The most crucial subject of discussion was, however, the financial situa tion. Some of the delegates were apparently bold enough to criticise present methods and to suggest means, including the establishment of a regular budget, whereby extravagance might be curtailed and the power of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, the Director-General oi Finance, might be curbed, ihe critics seemed to have quarrelled violently with the sheikh and to have incurred the displeasure of the King. It is, indeed, said that this controversy decided His Majesty to make an end of the conference sooner than he might otherwise have done.’ 10. Broadly speaking, it may be said that the conference did more to make discontent articulate than to solve problems. It emphasised the polarisation between Nejda arrogance and the sense of grievance with which Hejazis see themselves ridden over roughshod while their money is drained out of the country to pay for extravagant purchases abroad and to supply the needs of Nejd. From the point of view of a foreign observer, perhaps the most interesting feature of the proceedings was the tendency, due more, perhaps, to subservience than to conviction in the case of persons other than officials and ulema, to assert Islamic exclusiveness. I am told that some of the pilgrimage questions were approached in the spirit that foreign pilgrims should be discouraged from invoking the assistance of their consular authorities. The view seems to have prevailed that any foreign experts employed should be Moslems and that any concessions granted should also be granted to Moslems. , 11. In some ways, indeed, the conference .seems to have taken on the character of a Moslem religious gathering rather .than that of a Hejazi national assembly. It is even suggested that it was intended partly as a counter-move to the efforts of the Indian, Shauqat Ali, who is notoriously hostile to Ibn Saud, to bring about a general Moslem conference. In this connexion, it is interesting to note that the Mecca representatives at the National Conference included two Indian notables resident there, Messrs. Abdullah and Obeidullah Dehlavi. According to my principal informant, a proposal was actually mooted that Indians should be given a share in the administration of the country, but was rejected by the King, in accord with his Syrian advisers, owing to the danger of Indians becoming consular tools. 12. I should be sorry to vouch for everything in this hurriedly-written and imperfectly-informed report, but I think that, in the main, it gives a fairly accurate account of an interesting, though incomprehensive, experiment; interest ing as a reflex of the state of affairs in this country; inconclusive because Ibn Saud will gang his ain gait, so far as religious, financial and tribal considerations do not restrict his freedom of motion. 13. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, His Majesty’s High Com missioner at Jerusalem, the Acting High Commissioner at Bagdad and the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

In various other reports I have dealt with particular problems and Ibn Saud s groping efforts to deal with them before departing for Nejd, as he intends to do in the near future. The press of business thus entailed kept him in Mecca long past the date which he had originally fixed for coming to Jedda. In the event he arrived here on the 14th June and left in the evening of the 17th June. 2. The King’s difficulties remain unsolved. I have not yet heard what passed at the National Convention which sat from the 2nd to 11th June. I gather, however, that it produced little except some forward suggestions bv the bolder members and some consequent Royal displeasure. 3. In these circumstances, the King has been anxiously sizing up his position vis-d-vis of Great Britain, viewed both as a possible source of danger, having regard to ■ His Majesty's Government's recent severity, but also as a possible helper. Fuad Bey Hamza preceded the King and arrived in Jedda on the Hth June. We discussed current business on the 12th June. On the 13th June he came to see me with the object of expounding general views on the relations between Great Britain and Hejaz-Nejd and with the more special object of discussing my personal position in regard to them. This has, unfortunately, become a factor in the general situation, as for some time past the King has taken it into his head that I am hostile, and has attributed the policy of His Majesty’s Government to my inspiration. Both he and Fuad Bey exaggerate pathetically my influence. His Majesty has become alarmed, but is great enough to give play to a Royal resentment. I owe it to Fuad Bey to say that he has shown sincere anxiety to bridge the gulf, not only, I think, in order to enlist my assistance, though he naturally desires to do that, but from a genuine belief that I am not such a bad fellow if I am taken the right way. 3. I regret to have to lay stress on this matter of my personal position. T do so because it has assumed an absurd importance in Hejazi eyes, and has therefore a more general importance, however factitious. I may say that, although I have been outspoken on various occasions, those on which my language has caused most displeasure have been occasions when I have been carrying out your express instructions. 4. I have the honour to enclose three memoranda describing my various interviews with Fuad Bey and the King during the last week. You will see that I have been at special pains to disabuse the King of any idea that I am personally antagonistic. It was with that object that in the various conversations 1 used on my own side a freedom of language which may appear to you excessive. That was the only way in which I could appear sympathetic, yet remain non-committal, I made it clear throughout that any views I expressed were purely personal. I came away from my audience on the 17th June with the feeling that, with Fuad Bey s help, I had reinstated myself in the King’s regard to a considerable extent, but that my tenure of it was precarious and would depend on whether I could see him through with His Majesty’s Government. 5. I turn with relief to the substance of the matter. The King wants an understanding with Great Britain. He cannot realise that the only possible basis of such an understanding is the settlement of questions as they arise. Exaggerating his power, even in the midst of his present weakness, he conceives the possibility of a sort of permanent entente, almost an alliance, and an alliance potentially directed against the Hashimites. He knows that that would be a good thing for him. He imagines that it would be so well worth His Majesty’s Government's while that they ought to be ready to help him—and the help he most- needs at the present time is pecuniary help in some shape or form. [192 h—1] R2 6. It would be too cynical to suggest that Ibn Sand is offering to His Majesty’s Government a “ pure and virgin ' love for a consideration. He is not himself cynical or brazen enough foi that. ^ nioie liKe the maiden of pantomime in a snowstorm, but proudly conscious of a station, a beauty and a virtue that, given their chance, must cause her to be loved and honourably set up in life for her own sake.

' And oh, how happy should I be too! ” 7. I have tried to illustrate by a flippant example what I conceive to he Ibn Baud's attitude, because I think it reveals it better than pages of solemn analysis. He is not insincere, but he is fairly desperate at the moment and quite unpractical. He admitted towards the end of our conversation on the 17th Tune that the questions he had asked me to put to His Majesty’s Government were too hypothetical to be answerable. That does not mean that he will not expect some sort of an answer. I do not see what His Majesty’s Government can do to help him. Political commitments to him, except those of a purely negative kind, seem to be out of the question. It was decided two years ago that there could be no question of a renewal of direct financial assistance. He hinted then at a request for bread, and he was offered a common form of commercial treaty. I can only leave you to consider whether there is any form of kindness which His Majesty’s Government could show him without prejudice to their obligations elsewhere and without spending money. I am telegraphing about one point only, that of the possibility of getting a British bank to help him, because that is a concrete proposal, though it seems to me as unpractical as all the rest. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. (A) Conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on June 13. 11 AD BEY HAMZA spoke to me at length on the 13th June regarding the general state of relations between Ibn Baud and His Majesty’s Government, with somewhat special reference to the effect thereon of my personal position vis-a-vis of His Majesty. He had meditated his statement for some time and it was carefully considered. 2. Fuad Bey spoke of the object of my mission. The King’s wish to see a British Legation established here was dictated by a desire to have at his Court a representative of such standing that he could represent His Majesty’s point of \iew to His Majesty’s Government and speak on their behalf with authority, enjoying a greater latitude in the discussion of affairs than could be expected in the case of a junior official. Fuad Bey stressed the importance of personal factors, and expressed a desire to restore mv relations with the King to their former friendly footing. 3. Fuad Bey traced the history of Ibn Baud’s relations with His Majesty s Government. They had originated as far back as thirty years ago, when the King was the guest of Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit. The policy of His Majesty’s WaS f avoura ble to Mubarak at a time when the Turks were backing ! bn Rashid. At that time and afterwards they had lent their moral support to Tn Baud Their relations with him were strengthened during the Great War. A had been concluded at that time, establishing relations of such a nature nat His Majesty had accepted a kind of vassalage of Great Britain, to which it was unnecessary now to look back, as that situation had been ended by the Treaty of Jedda m 1927. tt- f 1 i^dly relations, kuad Bev said, had passed through periods when fns Majesty s Government seemed cooler or even antagonistic. They had supported King Hussein in the dispute over Taraba and Khurma in 1918-19. Ibn Rashid had been given support from the Iraq side before his death in 1921,4 (4) The King's dominions so situated as to lie across the line of Britisli imperial communications through the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and by the transdesert route to the north of them; it was Great Britain’s interest that there should be no menace to those communications. (5) In particular, Great Britain wished to be free to use the Hasa coast tW purposes of aerial communication, a thing which could only be don on a basis of friendship with Ibn Saud, and which was all the more important because of the possible difficulty of using Persian territory ' (6) It was in Great Britain’s interest to counteract Bolshevik propaganda in the East, whether illegitimate or carried on under a cloak of legality and in this His Majesty co-operation was needed. 11. Fuad Bey said that these were very general headings, under each of which special questions arose. He instanced the question of Aqaba and Ma’an and questions in the Persian Gulf. Pie regarded such matters as being of subsi d iary importance. 12. The King was on his side, Fuad Bey went on, compelled to rely on the assistance and support of Great Britain. 13. The object of my mission, he said, should be to harmonise and promote the interests of both sides, between which interests there was no contradiction. 14. I observed that Fuad Bey had indicated what, in his view, were the things for which Great Britain looked to Ibn Saud, but he had indicated in a single sentence only the things for which His Majesty looked to Great Britain. 15. Fuad Bey said that he was prepared for questions on his statement. He could not tell me the King's desiderata in detail without taking instructions, but he could tell me his own ideas on the understanding that I should treat what he said as purely personal. He developed then, on this agreed understanding, on the following lines :— ' (1) A settlement of the Hejaz Railway question, which interested the King both politically and economically; politically from the point of view of bringing certain parts of his dominions into closer touch with each other; economically, because of the value of the railway, if reconditioned, as a means of rapid transit. Fuad Bey referred to a private letter which I had written to the King and which was in the file. I said that, while I was not authorised to discuss the question, I was glad to know that His Majesty’s advisers had know ledge of the letter, which had taken the form it did for very special reasons. Puad Bey understood those reasons, and said that, as they had imposed a special course of action, a suitable communication would be made to me in reply in the first instance. (2) The question of Aqaba and Ma'an was still unsettled. He did not say that the King wished to reopen it now or to press it, but it was an outstanding matter between him and His Majesty’s Government. \3) The King desired assistance in connexion with the extensive Wakfs in territory under British control. (4) Puad Bey said that he was on such terms with me that he could speak of a matter, which others might hesitate to broach so frankly, viz., the rffi nC ! al neec ^ s 0 ^. this country. I knew very well, he said, the King’s difficulties and liabilities. He was expected to maintain security, to provide a sound sanitary administration; to improve his ports; to promote economic development; and to seek resources other than t e pilgrimage on which the country at present depended and w r hich had become precarious. He reminded me that the Turks in their time had to maintain an army of 30,000 men in the Hejaz. and to subsidise ribes as well. The resources available were known. I observed that I myself had no accurate idea of them.) If the King had to work on the Turkish plan and did things on the Turkish scale, it would now be necessary to spend £1 million to £2 million a year on security alone. It was also necessary to provide for the civil administration and for representatives abroad. Fuad Bey, after enumerating those burdens, observed that both King Hussein and m , and had enjoyed British financial assistance in the past.(S* I 5 (5) Finally, Iuad Bey said, His Majesty’s Government could help Ibn Saud by ensuring a good attitude on the part of his neighbours, in regard to whom we had a special position. • ^ j huad Bey assured me, and renewed the assurance later, that the King desired a per feet understanding with His Majesty s Government, and that, if y*^h an understanding existed, His Majesty was prepared to meet us on all t. points to which he conceived us to attach importance. 17 - 1 Ranked Fuad Bey for speaking to me so fully and frankly. There followed a long and intimate conversation which was confined to the question of m\ personal relations with Ibn Saud, to which Fuad Bey had referred tact fully as being in need of restoration to an earlier and better footing. I said that I myself had been conscious of a strain. I traced in detail the history of relations with Ibn Saud, referring to the various occasions on which, in dealing with particular matters, notably the Transjordan frontier question, I appeared to have given offence. While agreeing generally with Fuad Bey s definition of the object of a mission like mine, and his view as to the importance of personal factors in diplomacy, I pointed out that, in questions of the highest importance, diplomatic representatives were increasingly dependent on their central Govern ments, and that the importance of personal factors, great as it was, was apt to be exaggerated in Eastern countries. I said, not by way of excuse or apology, but out of my strong desire to disabuse the King of any idea that I was antagonistic, that, if at times I had spoken or written very plainly, it was either because I was bound by quite definite instructions or else because I wished to get certain questions settled without their assuming such importance as to force His Majesty’s Government into the necessity of themselves taking a strong line. When instructions assumed final form they had to be carried out. The final form often differed from the original form as a result of consultation with me. I deprecated any idea that the attitude taken up by His Majesty’s Government over, e.g., Transjordan frontier question was inspired bv me or was due to anything except the serious view that His Majesty’s Government found them selves compelled to take up a particular situation, which had been exaggerated to a dangerous point since October. 18. I pointed out to Fuad Bey the special difficulties of a Minister in dealing with a King who was effectively his own Minister for Foreign Affairs and delegated so little authority to his advisers that he handled foreign business himself not only by directing general policy but by going into all the details personally. It was a necessary consequence of this that a Minister might have to address direct to the King communications, sometimes of a disagreeable nature, which, in other countries, would normally be addressed to a Minister of State. 19. Fuad Bey recognised my difficulties and promised to do everything in his power to satisfy the King that my attitude was not one of hostility. He suggested that, when I had strong representations to make, I should make them to himself rather than direct. I said that it was necessary for me to lay certain matters before His Majesty in person, and that I was sometimes formally directed to do so. Subject to this I was quite prepared, and myself preferred, to discuss details with the King’s advisers. 20. As it was late, we agreed to reserve anything I might have to say in regard to the remainder of Fuad Bey’s statement for a further interview. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. (B) Further Conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on June 16. FUAD BEY came to see me again on the 16th June. We discussed some minor matters, but his main purpose was to complete our conversation of the 13th June before I should see the King. The following is a much-condensed account of what passed :— 2. Fuad Bey brought me the King’s reply to my recent private communica tion about the Hejaz Railway. (I am dealing with this separately.) He brought also a less formal letter of his own, in which he suggested certain corrections in my record of his statement of the 13th June, which I had let him see. (I have [192 h—1] B 86 introduced these corrections into the record of oui first con\eisation.) He asked me to add the following points to his original statement (a) He had spoken to me without instructions from the King, but he was personally convinced that the King’s interest lay in a good under standing with Great Britain. (b) He knew that the King himself had the best intentions towards Gr^ Britain and relied on her alone. 3. Fuad Bey explained that, in these circumstances, his object was to arrive at an understanding with me as to the objects we should jointly pursue, using our influence with our respective authorities. I replied that I was at one with him in his idea that we should work together to promote good relations, but said that our positions were different. He was the King's adviser on foreign affairs and was the real Minister for Foreign Affairs, in so far as there was any such Minister other than the King himself, for the Emir Feisul, the theoretical Minister, did not, so far as I knew, concern himself with, foreign business. He (Fuad) was therefore in the position of a responsible statesman. I myself was a civil servant. I could, and did, advise my Government on particular questions, but normally a diplomatic representative did not shape major policy. I could hardly, therefore, enter into a contract, as it were, to pursue a given set of objects, though I could, and would, col Inborate with him. 4. I had promised to give buad Bey some observations on his statement of the 14th June. I began with his historical retrospect recognising that all through Ibn Saud had been a friend. Fuad Bey knew more, 1 said, than I did about the details of the recent history of Arabia. I suggested, however, that he had not paid sufficient attention to the fact that the events to which he had adverted were all parts of a difficult process of readjustment following on the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. The position after the Great War was that there were certain parts of Arabia in which we had taken on definite responsibilities and others in which we had a less direct interest, two being areas ruled over by two Sovereigns who were both our friends. We were indebted to King Hussein as well as to Ibn Saud. We had sought to work for a stable Arabia and to compose differences. Ibn Saud had, so far as territory was concerned, come best out of the whole process, not thanks to us but to himself. Fuad had spoken of encirclement. It appeared to me that we had been on the edge of the circle first and that Ibn Saud had expanded until he filled it. For me, I said, history began with the Treaty of Jedda in 1927, subject to there being a pre-history dating from 1925. Owing to our special responsibilities in Iraq and Transjordan we had negotiated the Bahra and Hadda Agreements at a time when Ibn Saud had not yet completed his conquest of the Hejaz. 5. Fuad Bey suggested that all would have been well had we kept the adjoining countries under our own control and had not introduced into them as rulers the King’s enemies. I said that the first alternative was out of the question, because responsible people in Great Britain and British public opinion did not want enlarged commitments but reduced commitments in the East, and because there were nationalist sentiments to be reckoned with in the countries themselves. Ihose sentiments had been strong in Iraq and they existed in Transjordan, though the position of that territory was different and its evolution was less complete. I demurred strongly to the idea that there could be no real friendship between us and those countries, because we retained a special position, which in the case of Iraq would be reduced to an absolute minimum when the treaty of 1930 became operative. We wished to be, and thought we could be. friends with everybody. Our ideal was to see settled States in Arabia in fnendship with us and with each other. A great measure of equilibrium had been achieved. There were States with definite frontiers, even though the ransjordan frontier, for instance, was in one part still a theatre of difficulty and in another the subject of an outstanding question, as he had reminded me w e f n speaking of Aqaba and Maan. I had never had occasion to deal with that ?qo 7 CU n ( ^ uest 1 ‘ on J anc ^ did not mean to discuss it. It had been in abeyance since i i ’ w e *} we aa d stated a position which the King had not accepted; but he nad agreed to a status quo and modus vivendi, and all I could see for it, if there 'T ere 1 f n outstanding question, was that the status quo and the modus vivendi should continue. (1 uad Bey reminded me that he had himself disclaimed anyidea of reopening or pressing the question at the present time.) The equilibrium, 1 said, was sucn that tne King had come into contact with us in every direction save one. v)ui desire toi stability was such that we wished to see peace on all his frontlets, e\eii on the one on winch he hs.d no contact with us. We were not concerned with the i emeu and I had never spoken about it, but on that side, too, ^Kwe should like to see good relations between Ibn Baud and the Imam, with whom we got on quite well, though we had not succeeded in making a treaty with him. b. luining^to 1 nad i^ey s statement of what he conceived to be our desiderata, I said that it seemed to me to cover the ground pretty well. W r e certainly wanted the first four things he had enumerated. I recognised that the King’s great achievement was that he had established security, a matter of direct interest to us in the pilgi im area when it was complete and of indirect interest to us in a more general sense. As regards the fifth point on his list, I did not know the position as regards flying over Persia, but we should like to have freedom m agreement with the Powers concerned to fly either way along the Persian Gulf. In so far as Bolshevik propaganda was still an active force in the East, it was our interest to counteract it. (Fuad Bey said he wished to sneak to me another time about Bolshevik propaganda.) 7. As regards i uad Bey’s purely personal estimate of the ways in which His Majesty’s Government might help the King, I said as little as I could. I said that, if he wished in due course to speak about the Hejaz Railway, I would report what he had to say; I had no instructions on the subject. I had said all I would say about Aqaba and Maan another question which had not arisen since I came here. He had referred to Persian Gulf questions. There had been a talk of discussing them last year, but eventually the Biscoe incident had held everything up. My Government were anxious that these questions should be handled bv Colonel Biscoe, as they were in his sphere. I could not, therefore, speak of the desiderata on both sides, but I might mention the impression produced by the King’s prolonged blockade, as it were, of Koweit. As for Wakfs, the King had discussed the subject with Sir G. Clayton in 1927 and had formulated desiderata. They had been carefully considered, and later in the year a reply had been returned, based on the constant policy of His Majesty’s Government of not interfering in so purely religious a matter. I remarked that I myself, though I sometimes made representations about Wakfs in the He.jaz at the instance of British Moslem interested parties, a thing rather different from interfering in Wakfs in a country which we administered or controlled in any way, always did so with hesitation and within as narrow limits as possible. There were, I observed in passing, many Wakfs for the benefit of pilgrims at Mecca, and the Hejazi Government would do well to see that they were well cared for. 8. I turned to finance. It was true that in the past His Majesty’s Govern ment had assisted King Hussein and Ibn Baud. That was part of a policy arising out of the war, when money was spent on many things—we had, for instance, spent millions on buying fish in Norway merely to prevent its going to our enemies. Economy was now the order of the day. It was a plank in every political platform in England. It was practised by His Majesty’s Government Every Government must now stand on its own feet. That was a hard saying, but true. I knew of the difficulties of this country. I realised that it was too dependent on the pilgrimage. I saw salvation only in the development of the fresh economic resources to which the Government had been turning their attention. I had heard of press statements about an application to Sweden for a geological mission. I had nothing against that. I would not encourage any hope of direct financial assistance from Great Britain, if that was what was in Fuad Bey’s mind. British interest might possibly be enlisted in connexion with economic schemes. If I could help with any advice in regard to such schemes I would be happy to do so. 9. Time was running out and I could not follow up the one remaining point in Fuad Bey’s statement of the 13th June; fortunately, perhaps, as Fuad Bey might have harped on an idea, which emerged in the course of our conversations, that Ibn Baud’s assistance, negative or even positive, would be useful to His Majesty’s Government if ever they had trouble in Iraq or Transjordan. I wound up the conversation by saying that I had given him an exposition of my own ideas. If they were in some ways discouraging, he would not take it amiss. It would be easy enough, but not honest, to intimate agreement with him: to say when hesuggested our working together on some paiticulai line . \es, that s splendid* I’ll put it up to my Government,” and say two or three months later that my Government had turned it down. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. (C) Record of Audiences with I bn Sand on J une 14 and 17, 1931. THE King arrived in Jedda early on the 14th June. In accordance with his custom he received the foreign representatives in succession that morniim As my audience on this occasion was formal I did not touch on current business but I said that I had been awaiting an opportunity of conveying to His Majesty the congratulations of His Majesty s Government on the successful negotiations with Iraq (see Foreign Office telegram No. 86 of the 21st May). I said that I had previously offered my own congratulations and those of Sir F. Humphrys, but that His Majesty's Government had waited until ratification was assured! I explained that I had received my instructions some little time ago when His Majesty was expected in Jedda, but that, having told Sheikh Yussuf Yasin the nature of the message. I had deferred the communication until I could see the King in person. The King paid a renewed tribute to the part played by His Majesty's Government and myself, and spoke with great appreciation of Sir F. Humphrys, when at a later stage 1 said that Sir Francis had asked me to thank him for his gracious reply to a personal letter sent at the time of Nuri Pasha’s visit. I observed that we had, indeed, worked hard for a successful result, but that its attainment was due to the attitude observed by the parties directly concerned in the final negotiations. 2. I had discussed outstanding business so thoroughly with Fuad Rev that I had really little to say to the King himself during this visit to Jedda. I therefore told Fuad Bey on the 15th June that I was not applying for a business audience, but that it might be useful if I saw the King, as His Majesty was goiim to Riadh and I to London; that he himself might have matters to discuss with me; and that, in any case, I hoped the King would give me a few' minutes before he left for Mecca, so that I might pay my respects on the eve of our separation for a long period. 3. The King received me on the 17th June and kept me for two hours. Fuad Bey interpreted, and Sheikh Yussuf Yasin was present nearly the whole time. I began by saying very much wffiat 1 had said to Fuad Bey. as stated in the previous paragraph. It was clear that His Majesty did not wish any more than I did myself to discuss the details of any particular question, but he engaged me in a conversation of a general kind, in which on his position vis-a-vis of His Majesty s Government. The following is an account of wffiat passed, necessarily abridged and not based on notes. I have omitted one or two digressions :— 4. The King spoke of his old friendship with Great Britain. He said that in reverting to this theme, he did not mean to imply that the friendship wars in peril, but it w r as well to remind himself and His Majesty's Government of it. 1 he capital question for him was that of his personal position as sovereign of the dominions over which he now ruled. He had, he said, had three inter mediaries with His Majesty’s Government—Sir Percy Cox. Sir Gilbert Clayton and myself. Fie said that he had been led to expect much by Sir P. Cox, but tnat Sir Percy had not fulfilled his promises or justified his (the King s) expectations. Later he had disclosed his mind to Sir Gilbert Clayton and had charged him to report all that was in it to His Majesty's Government. He did wffiat Sir Gilbert had reported, but there had been no response, as Gilbert had gone to Iraq and had died soon after. He was now going to go o\ei the same ground w r ith me, not having been able to do so last year when our discussions related to particular matters. He mentioned that he had given k heikh Mafiz Wahba a very general idea of what he was aiming at, but that the s ieikh had reported that he had not found a suitable opportunity of speaking to His Majesty’s Government. 5. I said that I was at the entire disposal of the King to convey anything e might w ish to communicate to His Majesty’s Government.6. The Kii)g said that there was nothing in the general situation in Arabia to cause anxiety. The situation might, however, change. He was the friend of Great Britain, whatever might befall. If any change occurred, if, for instance, His Majesty’s Government had difficulties in neighbouring countries (I do not recollect very clearly the words used, but this was implied if not stated), he would ✓^jke to know where he stood. What acts would His Majesty’s Government wish im to avoid ? In what positive way could he assist them in case of need ? These were the questions wdiich he had sought to elucidate in the past through Sir P. Cox and Sir G. Clayton. He was asking me now to obtain answers to them. How did lie stand ? He did not mean that his friendship depended on the answer. He would be Great Britain's friend as he had always been, if they needed his friendship. He was not making it a matter of bargaining. 7. I undertook to convey His Majesty's statement to His Majesty's Govern ment. I added that I could hardly venture to say much myself, but that I should like to offer a few observations. On this the King said that he was not only giving me a message, but seeking my personal advice. He did not wash to say anything that might produce a bad effect or breed suspicion. 8. Thus encouraged, I said rather more than I at first intended. I reminded the King that he had sent Sheikh Yussuf Yasin to speak to me on the 1st April about his perturbation over the apparent tension between Great Britain •md himself. I had told the sheikh that His Majesty’s Government's fundamental attitude of friendship towards the King had not changed, and had stressed the fact that His Majesty’s Government dealt with particular questions on their merits. I had not disguised the danger of general relations being affected by such a question as that of the Transjordan frontier, but the danger had now been averted The language I had used to Sheikh Yussuf and similar language on other occasions had been approved. 9. I spoke of the bases of our friendship with Ibn Sand. Old association was a factor in it; that always counted for something. The impression which he created personally was another factor; those of my countrymen who had had intercourse with him had always, in my experience, been attracted by his personality. The greatest factor of all was, however, the fact that His Majesty’s Government saw in him an element of stability in a country where they desired stability. We were a nation of shopkeepers and wanted stability everywhere. We had a more special interest in stability in Arabia for reasons into which I would not enter, as I did not wish to be too lengthy. 10. The King, I said, had sought my advice about his message to His Majestv’s Government, I did not dissuade him from sending it; I could not encourage him to hope for a definite reply. I knew little of what Sir P. Gox had done in Arabia, but I had known him otherwise. Whatever turn he might give to a matter, neither he nor Sir G. Clayton were men who would fail to report fully anything the King had said. If he had elicited no answer I thought it was because his questions related to a hypothetical case. It was a fixed pi lump e with His Majesty’s Government to deal with questions as they arose, and they had a horror of defining an attitude in regard to hypothetical cases. I enlarged 11 On this the King admitted that he could not expect a definite answer to his questions. What he wanted was to expound his views to His Majesty s Government and (this was implied rather than stated) to enhst my assistance 12. I took the opportunity of begging the King to believe that 1 was smcei ely well-disposed towards him and his country I would, and did, ^piesem his views to my Government. As I had told Fuad Bey, final instructions mig d ffer from original instructions as a result of my suggestions, but final instructions must be carried out. The representative of a Government was like a chisel . , hands of a carpenter, an essential tool, but worked b&gt; the cai pen ei. , i? 13. The King appreciated this. Be suggested, however that beto e carrying out instructions I should ascertain his Government s si e o ^ , order that it might be taken into account. 1 did not analyse this obvious y impossible suggestion. I assured the King of m\ gooc ^ ‘ too i an( j that I had used the analogy of the chisel advisedly. was , ofZbS-Sght ato tktdrcuti 111 j^dTw^iif W we could^et Z*rl™£T Resident in thePersian Gulf, and said I hoped the visit could be arranged if the King was staying some months in Nejd. I added that I could not suggest anything definite at the moment, as Colonel Biscoe had been ill, and had, I believed, left for England. 14. I was about to leave, but the King detained me. He said he did not want to do anything behind my back. He had not consulted his advisers about what he was going to say, but he had made up his mind to say it. whatever they mi cr ht think. It was a question oi the financial position. I his had two aspects ^ The first was the exchange situation, which turned on two factors—riyals and nickel. Steps had been taken to gather in nickel, and it had been rehabilitated As for riyals, His Majesty intended to bring them into legal circulation throughout all his dominions, and this would produce relief, as tne quantity of silver money was not excessive and an extended use would suffice to revalorise it. The other question was that of banking arrangements. I here had been an arrangement with the Dutch Bank, which had broken down on questions between its repre sentatives here and their principals. The King said he would like to find another bank, which under suitable arrangements would serve the purposes of a State bank. He would prefer a British institution. He sought my advice and that of His Majesty's Government. 15. I said that my personal opinion would have no value, as I knew too little of the machinery of banking. I would willingly consult His Majesty's Govern ment. I hinted that I thought it would be difficult to find a British bank, but did not exclude the possibility of interesting firms like Barclays, who were in the Red Sea, or Lloyds, who were in Egypt. lb. The King said what he wanted to know was whether he might or might not hope for a British bank, and whether any firm who was interested would send a representative. The matter was of some urgency, as he had received offers from other quarters. I said 1 had heard various reports. I had heard, for instance, of a plan to authorise an Indian Moslem bank to establish itself here, although it had been represented to me as an idea conceived with a view to the convenience of pilgrims rather than with the more general purpose the King had indicated. This was a feeler, in case His Majesty should feel inclined to say something about the other advances made to him. He did not. however, respond.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. /’'i E 4877/2364/25| Mr. Hope-Gill to the. Marquess of Reading.—(Received September 14.) (No. 346.) My Lord, Jedda, A ugust 29, 1931. WITH reference to Mr. Henderson’s despatch No. 308 of the 7th August, regarding a State Bank in the Hejaz, I have the honour to report that I learn confidentially from the local manager of the Netherlands Trading Society, more commonly known here as the Dutch Bank, that his principals in Amsterdam seem to be seriously contemplating a loan of £500,000 to Ibn Saud, to be secured on customs receipts and conditioned by suitable concessions in matters of handling and control of all public moneys. 2. Mr. Jacobs himself regards the purely economic and financial bases of some such contract as sufficiently sound. He supplied me in confidence with the following figures of recent Hejazi revenue from customs, which he believes to be fairly accurate:— AH. 1347. AH. 1348. AH. 1349. £1,174,362 £998,263 £880,320 (The Moslem year 1349 ended last mid-May.) The details of these sums, shown by ports of entry, is attached. 3. The political future, however, worried Mr. Jacobs profoundly, the more so as there has recently been a further heavy spate of bazaar gossip about latent revolution in the towns of Hejaz and open revolt in the deserts of Nejd. If the Netherlands Trading Society decide against the venture, the decision w:ll, 1 think, be almost entirely due to their lack of belief in Ibn Sand's ability to maintain peace and his own position for a sufficient further period of time. 4. If the loan is made, I gather that £200,000 of it will be required either to pe&lt; T the silver rial at its present fictitious value of 10 to the £ or to cover its drop to its silver-content value of Wd. A further £200,000 would, 1 am told, be earmarked for economic development of a paying kind, the opening up of mines, for example, a subject on which I hope to be in a position to report more fully by next bag The remaining £100,000, they say, would be required to free Ibn Sand and his Government from all debt and set the machinery of State once more in working order. It is at present so rusted up that the pay even of the police has for some time ceased to trickle through. Forty members of the Jedda force resigned yesterday, and there is apparently foundation for the prospect of a police raid on the bakers. I have, &amp;c. C. G. HOPE-GILL. Jr : / September 14, 1931.

I HAVE dealt in previous reports, ending with my despatch No. 253 of the 1st July, with the deplorable financial situation of the Hejazi Government and the various exchange crises of the last four or five months. I mentioned in my despatch No. 253 and have had occasion to refer elsewhere to the plan for improving the internal exchange by generalising the use of the Hejazi currency throughout Ibn Saud’s dominions, a plan which the National Conference seems to have recommended, with the rider that the Maria Theresa dollar should be eliminated gradually and about which the King himself spoke to me in my audience of the 17th June. 2. This matter was the subject of a Government notice published in the “ Umm-al-Qura ' of the 19th June. After a pious exordium, the notice explains in a rather involved manner the reasons for which, while postponing any decision to enforce the exclusive use of the Hejazi currency, the Government have been impelled to lay down certain rules with a view to facilitating transactions and obviating usurious practices. I enclose a translation of the portion of the notice containing those rules, which are to operate as from the end of Safar, i.e., mid- July 1931. 3. The effect of the rules is not altogether clear to me. but it would appear to be that the silver and nickel currency of the Hejaz is made legal tender throughout the King’s dominions, under unspecified penalties for refusing it; but that the use of other currencies is allowed subject to certain conditions, including the fixation of internal rates of exchange. I doubt whether the exact effect matters much as the events of the last few months have shown that the Government cannot enforce for long any regulations aiming at an artificial stabilisation of the exchange. At the time of writing this despatch the quotation for riyals in Jedda is about 14 = £1. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Acting High Commissioner at Bagdad, and the High Commissioner at Jerusalem.

CONFIDENTIAL. ^ 4266/2064/25] Nd? Mr. Hope-Gill to Mr. A. Henderson.—[Received Aucjust 18.) (No. 315.) ^ Sir, ^ Jedda, July 30, 1931. THE more critical of Ibn Sand Mr. Philby has felt, the more communicative he has become. Recent despatches of Sir A. Ryan’s have traced the development of this tendency. A few evenings ago I learned its origin from Mr. Philby. 2. He had been stung, I think, into unwonted frankness by trouble over the Marconi contract. Trouble over the effective range of the wireless telephony is still to come; the present friction centring round the refusal of the Hejazi Govern- to take over the four mobile sets and their failure to pay three of the monthly instalments of £1,000 each. Mr. Philby was contemplating drastic measures, such as sending Mr. Boucicault out of the country. He was only deterred by the fact that all the material has arrived and is in Hejazi hands, and by the fear that they would begin monkeying w r ith it themselves. 3. He led the conversation on to financial matters in general and Ibn Baud’s incompetence in particular. While the pilgrim hosts w’ere stoning the devil at Mima, the King held meeting after meeting to discuss the problem of the nickel exchange. Mr. Philby attended them, silent but increasingly indignant. After much talk one day, it must have been the 30th April, the King ordained that the Saudi piastre should henceforth stand at 44 to the rial; its par value was 22, but it had dropped into the 50’s; everyone applauded the King’s wisdom and his fiat went forth. On the next day, after much further talk, the King decided that the piastre should stand at 22 and accepted equal applause from the same advisers. Mr. Philby was furious, but waited until the King had left to tell the sycophants what he thought of them. On the following day the King, whose ears are long, chaffed him beyond endurance. After a heated discussion, Mr. Philby was sent out into the streets with a gold sovereign and a silver rial in his hand and told to prove his assertion that, whatever His Majesty might ordain, not one of his subjects would sell a silver rial for 22 pieces of nickel. In vain he pointed out to the King that what he wanted for this purpose was only a handful of nickel. Ibn Saud, he maintains, simply could not understand so simple a monetary point. He left in disgust at the ignorance of Ibn Saud and the suppleness of his advisers, and has but rarely see the King since then. The incident may well have been distorted by Mr. Philby, but there is probably enough truth in it to make it interesting. Its relation is certainly illuminating. 4. Mr. Philby was not less cynical about the impossibility of obtaining banking facilities for this country, though rather more guarded. It had been understood that he was interested in Lutfullah’s Bank to the extent of urging its advantages on Ibn Saud (see paragraph 7 of Sir A. Ryan's despatch Na 177 of, the 15th May). He now holds Lutfullah up to ridicule as that inordinately vain individual who, in King Hussein’s day, had himself named his iVmbassador at Rome and paid for the privilege not only his own salary, but those of an imposing suite. Mr. Philby has even stated that the banker is now bankrupt. His attitude seems to be one of general disillusionment. The King has feet of mud. The country, in National Conference, has ruled out anything in the nature of a State Bank. So much the worse for Lutfullah. 5. Mr. Philby also spoke of the benzine contract, to which Sir A. Ryan referred in paragraph 7 of his despatch No. 280 of the 12th July. He affirmed that, after threatening to close down his Legation and to have himself withdrawn, the Russian Minister had at length succeeded in securing the contract but nothing more, that is nothing in the nature of more favourable terms for the entry of Russian goods. The Hejazi Government had agreed to buy 50,000 cases of [219 s—2] ■ _L a iSL » 5876 August 18, 1931 Section 2. \Q&gt;.~ :7 s\ ' w W s2 benzine at 1-50 dollars a case, to be paid for in three instalments at th intervals beginning three months after delivery.

[E 3889/2064/25 n q J j w v.; July 27, 1931 1 Q Q Section 1. No. 1. Sir A . Ryan to Mr. A . Henderson.—(Received July 27.) (No. 253.) ^ Sir, . 1 Jedda, July 1, 1931. IN my despatch No. 177 of the 15th May, I attempted to bring up to date the information in my earlier despatch No. 108 of the 23rd March, regarding the financial situation in this country, with special reference to the problem of exchange. I have had occasion in other reports to advert to the growing hope lessness of I bn Saud 's financial position, and to the way in which it has come to be a dominant factor in the political situation in the Hejaz. 2. There has been no improvement in the financial outlook since the middle of May. It seems more than probable, though it cannot be taken as certain, that any gold reserve which the Director-General of Finance may have had up his sleeve has been practically exhausted. This is the view of the manager of the Dutch Bank, who was in close touch with the Government during March and April. He told me recently that at the end of that period the Government were in fact good for the £60,000 in gold required to bolster up the exchange. I could not ascertain whether he actually made a new arrangement with them then, but, if he did, little or nothing came of it, and Mr. Jacob s principals in Holland have settled down to an attitude of abstention from further transactions. Before the departure on leave of M. Adriaanse, the future Netherlands Charge d'Affaires, who arrived here some months ago to be initiated into his duties in accordance / with the Dutch system, he was strongly pressed to use his influence at home to get^ the Dutch Government to get the Dutch Bank to be more accommodating. There is very little chance, however, of their altering their attitude. 3. I have reported elsewhere on the King’s experiment of convoking a National Conference of urban representatives, which sat from the 2nd to the 11th June, to review in an advisory capacity the problems confronting the Hejazi Government. Finance was naturally a prominent feature in the proceedings. As might have been expected, the members of the conference had no comfort to offer, and such advice as some of them were bold enough to tender was most | unpalatable to Ibn Baud. All that the conference effected was to help to give a I certain coherence to grievances which have gradually been growing articulate / and which may be summed up as follows : (a) The Hejaz is the victim of a double drain on its meagre resources, owing to the amount of money expended abroad on extravagant requirements, of which motor cars are the favourite example, and the amount which is devoted to expenditure proper to Nejd, notably subsidies to the tribes there; (5) the country has no budget in any true sense, and almost unlimited power in the financial domain is exerted by the Director-General, Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman, whose unpopularity increases by leaps and bounds, but whose position with the King seems to be unimpaired. Certain members of the conference had the courage to criticise Abdullah Suleiman and to proclaim the necessity for a budget. The King’s reply is said to have been in effect, k&gt; le budget, c est moi.” 4. The trouble has become concrete in two forms, viz., (a) the failure of all efforts to maintain the riyal exchange, and (b) the necessity for finding new money to carry Ibn Saud over a very lean period. Unless assistance can be obtained, it may be confidently anticipated that this period will be one of complete indigence for some months, that the next pilgrimage season will bring some temporary relief, and that, if the pilgrimage is again small, the position a year hence will be at least as bad as it is now. 5. The silver currency has entered on a new phase of depreciation during the last few weeks. The riyal stands now at about 14i to the pound. The wonder is that it has not gone lower. The King has his own cure, which I described when reporting on mv audience of the 17th June. I may repeat myself in order to make this despatch self-contained. All that is necessary, says Ibn Saud, is to bring the Hejazi silver and nickel currency into use throughout his dominions, [192 dd—1]and he has taken measures with that object. He may succeed, but f whether he realises how difficult it may be to secure acceptance in coui t ^ Nejd and Asir, of a currency which has been so blown upon in its co 1 ^ origin. He has, however, discovered one practical device. He left M Un ‘ 0 Nejd on the 28th June, intending to make a long stay. I understand fh^ ^ 0! time he is going to meet the tribal demands on his generosity by presents i n at ^ 6. But the need for new money has now become the mainr r iy a ^- 6. But the need for new money has now become the major problem 11 reported elsewhere Fuad Bey Hamza’s broad hint to me on the 12th Ji j Ve His Majesty's Government might come to Ibn Saud’s help financially as^ ii in other ways. The King himself was more guarded on the 17th June h a§ broached a definite request, which I submitted for your consideration ' ^ le telegram No. 170 of the 19th June, namely, that His Majesty's Government 11 ' T help him to enlist the services of a British bank. I mentioned in mv t i 1 * 11 ^ the King's statement that he had other offers. I have not been able to fi 6 ? 9111 much on the subject and nothing with certainty. I understand that theA^ Lutfullah, that Syrian in Egypt who has had a financial past in this coum^ has made approaches. The Banque Misr is also said to be interested I h-’ heard also of Lloyds and an unnamed fourth, possibly the Eastern Bank h m doubt very much whether either of them has come forward, although it is no Tl that Mr. Philby may have been taking soundings. In the enclosure to 6 despatch No. 235 of the 20th June, I dealt with another project to brino- 111 ^ Indian Moslem bank here. ° an 7. I owe a good deal of the above information, such as it is, to the of the Dutch Bank here. According to Mr. Jacobs, what the Government aiming at is to get a foreign bank to produce something like £200.000 in return for certain privileges like a monopoly of banking operations and privileges of note issue. He thought there might be something in the story about &amp; Amk Lutluiiah, as that gentleman runs a one-man show, and has on his hands a quantity of very fine notes, all ready printed, which he had made in connexion wUh his financial ventures here in the last days of the Hashimite regime ‘ihn baud, however would prefer to interest more regular bankers (and would also I think, hate to have to borrow in Egypt); but Mr. Jacobs did not see what the Hejazi Government could offer that would be sufficient to attract a serious concern with responsibilities to its shareholders. He emphasised the difficulty of enforcing a monopoly of banking in a place where every merchant of importance does a bit of banking as a side-line.

Sir, ! k o q n I vj / o u brinish mm&amp;J JliDD -. 16th July, 1931, ? 1 UO 1 I have the honour to etate that I received your telegram r.o. 113 of July 14th, relative to the possibility of a British bank establishing itself in the ilejaz, Just before an interview with Fuad Bey Hamza, who came down from Mecca for the inside of tnc lay on July 16th. I seized the opportunity of reading the i iibt paragraph of your telegram to Fuad Bey, who manifested no surprise or disappointment. In view of the first sentence of the second paragraph of your telegram, I told Fuad Bey as from myself that, while I did not exclude the possibility of the Hejezi Government enlisting tiie interest of a British bank, I could not honestly encourage them to hope for much in that direction. I let fall the various names I irnd heard mentioned in connection with possible ^arrangements with bankers (see paragraphs 6 and 7 of my despatch Ko. 263 of July let); but Fued Bey was not to be drawn. 6. X thought it inadvisable to suggest consultation with Messrs.Gellatly, Hankey and Co. Ltd. as regards the choice of a person to act for the Hejazi Government in the City. That firm has extensive and peculiar relations with the Hejazi Government and are themselves engaged in banking here on a fairly important scale. Their position vis-k-vis of the Government is so variable that any reference I might make to them Hie Majesty's j rincipal Secretary of i: tate foi Foreign Affaire.* s them in this connection would almost cexteinly be misunderstood, either qs an encouragement to hope that the firm mi ,ht themselves come to the help of the Ooverranent, which they are not prepared to do except on the most moderate scale, or as an attempt on my paxt to ram them do' n the throats of the Government* 4. as an illustration of the sin/ular way in which all such matters are approached here, I may mention that on July 8th, Fuad ^&gt;ey tsced me at the instance of the Director General of Finance to ^ influence with Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Com,any in favour of an arrangement whereby they would provide money for the specific purpose of maintaining the Hejazi representative missions abroad. The Director General was prepared to give security — apparently by depositing 1 cal silver currency — and to promise that the business would be perfectly safe. I asked vhy Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman did not go to Messrs.Gellatly Henkey and Company himself, adding that I understood they were on the best of terms. Fuad Bey said that he thought they were no longer on such good terms as formerly. Anyhow, he had been asked to pass on the message and was doing so; but he was careful to add in fairly clear language that he would prefer not to back his colleague’s word. f. I was naturally not very eager to intervene, least of all with a view to urging Messrs.Gelletly Hankey and Company to involve themselves in unsound business. X promised, howevex, to speak to the manager, Mr.A.J.Iarner. Then I did so three days latex', I found that he hid an appointment with Abdullah Suleiman himself for that afternoon and was expecting that Director General to talk Biggish Business, e.g. to see what Messrs.Gellatly Hankey and Company would do in return for a monopoly of the importation of benzine and petroleum. The upshot of the whole thing, as I learnt later from Mr.^ax'ner, was that Abdullah Suleiman asked for i1,500 to cover one month’s expenditure on thethe missions abroad and promised to pay interest on the sums already due hy the Government to the firm, a matter of f6,000 to —^ £7,000* Mr. arner is quite happy about these outetendin s and thought his firm would run to the extra £1,6000. I was able to telephone to Fuad Bey that I understood the Director General had had a satisfactory interview with Messrs.Oellatly Hankey and Company’s Manager and I left it at that.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 3468/1600/25] 5 1 9 3 No. 1. July 4, 1931. Section 1. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—{Received July 4) (No. 217.) H ^ T1V . . / Jedda, June 9, 1931. Il\ paragraph 8 of my despatch No. 200 of the 28th May relative to the general situation in this country, I mentioned a report that a council of repre sentatives was to be held at Mecca. I confirmed this in my telegram No. 156 of the 31st May, summing up very briefly the contents of my despatch. I have now the honour to report further on this interesting development. My report is not complete in all particulars, as I wish to forward it by bag to-day, and there has not been time to have all the matter available in the last issue of the “Umm-al- Qura translated. It will, however, put you in possession of the main facts. 1 hat is all that matters at present, for it is too soon in any case to judge of the real importance of the assembly. 2. On the 28th May, after I had drafted my earlier despatch, Fuad Bey Hamza told me that it was formerly the custom to hold consultative assemblies in this country, but that none had been convened in the last two years. The King had now, he said, decided to convoke an elective assembly of representatives of the principal towns to discuss and advise on present problems. Fuad Bey intimated that it would be convened annually and would be in the nature of a constitutional organ. It would sit at Muna, as there was a suitable palace there, and it was desired that the proceedings should be conducted in a tranquil atmosphere. Muna j^s, as you are aware, a few miles from Mecca on the road to Arafat and is ordinarily heard of only in connexion with the pilgrimage, as it is there that the pilgrims stone the Devil and spend the three days of the festival following Pilgrimage Day. 3. The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the following day, the 29th May, had a leading article and an announcement that elections had already been held in various towns in accordance with an ordinance of the King. There was nothing to show on what electoral basis the representatives had been or were being selected and the point is still obscure. So far as I am aware no organic regulations have been published. Nevertheless, considerable stress was laid on the elective and popular character of the “National Conference.” When the well-trained people of Jedda and Medina proceeded to nominate administrative officials their choice was disallowed. It appeared from the “ Umm-al-Qura ” that the King, acting in an Islamic spirit, wished to follow the example of ancient Caliphs and to establish a broader basis than before for consultation with wise and thoughtful men and to give his people an opportunity of ventilating grievances. He made a distinction, the writer explained, between Bedouin and townspeople. The Bedouin come direct to his door, notably at pilgrimage time, and he went into all their claims, complaints and affairs generally. The conference of urban representatives, henceforward to be held annually in Muharram, would enable him to acquaint himself with matters affecting the townspeople. The task of the conference would be, according to the “ Umm-al-Qura’s ” information, to study matters of religious law and observance, the means of ensuring justice and reforms in the domain of economic life and general progress. 4. The conference met at Muna on the 2nd June, but that place proved either too hot or too inaccessible, and on the second day the meeting-place was changed to Mecca. There the conference has been sitting since and Fuad Bey told me on the 6th June that it might be expected to go on for some time. It is hard to get any information other than that of the “ Umm-al-Qura ” as to what it is doing exactly. Even Mr. Philby, although he has twice been down from Mecca during the last month, has views rather than news. In his present pessimistic mood, his views are almost cynical, though he is not as cynical as some who suggest that the conference has been assembled with the object of levying contributions on its members. He confesses to ignorance as to what the Government are at, but inclines to think that, having to devise drastic measures [192 d—1]2 to cope with present difficulties, they have decided on a form of po ni1 i consultation, in order to be able to tell the townspeople later that they had th F opportunity of making themselves heard. fie criticises the arrangements ^ various particulars, e.g., he says that the conference has been saddled with th* secretariat of the permanent Legislative Council, a nominated body with an inpnf secretarial service, and he hints at possible hank\-panky in connexion with th Mecca ballot-boxes. „ „ „ . 5. The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 5th June was full of it all. It gi Ves of representatives, two being the president of the Legislative Council and anothf person on behalf of the Government; twenty-two for Mecca; eleven for Jedd/ nine for Medina; three each for Taif and Yambo; and ten members of th Legislative Council. I understand from other sources, though this is not staWl in the paper, that the members include separate representatives of the body of Ulama. It also appears that Governors, &amp;c., certainly the Governor of Jedda are participating in the labours of the conference. It elected its own president' one Sheikh Mohammed-al-Marzuki, and other officers, after the King had opened the proceedings with a speech and Sheikh lusuf Yasin had read the ao-enda Three committees were appointed to deal respectively with (a) public morals and the control of the pilgrimage; (b) judicial matters; and (c) general affairs The public have been invited to communicate any useful suggestions in writing to the secretary. On the second day the conference drew up a loyal address in reply to the King s speech. The King gave a banquet on the evening of the first day. 6. It will be observed that several of the most approved parliamentary forms have been observed. Has the Hejaz then become a parliamentary country to the extent that autocracy seeks a lead from the people? Has there been another of those bloodless revolutions in a form adapted to the conditions of the Holy Land ? The answer to both questions is probably in the negative. It would be unfair to Ihn Sand to suggest that it is all eye-wash. He is' con fronted with many problems. He would certainly like to solve the more urgent of them, e.q to appease the many complaints connected with the pilgrimage and to find a wav out of the present financial and economic morass. He may think sincerelv that it is a useful thing to seek wisdom even among the people. Whoever actually elected or selected the representatives of Jedda, for instance, they have not been ill-chosen. But the King will not and dare not part with power; nor can the best available representatives have the necessary knowledge, even if they were given the power, to solve the financial problems which dominate the position. The locomotive is off the rails. The most that can be hoped of such a conference is that it will serve as a safety valve and prevent the boiler from bursting, while the engine muddles its way through the desert under the auspices of the King and his advisers, who still remain really in charge of it. This mechanical illustration reminds me of the one concrete proposal which I have heard of so far in connexion with the problems submitted to the conference. It is that motor-cars should be abolished or severely restricted. The money for them goes out of the country and their increased use tends to destroy established trades. If the camel came nack into his own, depression would be relieved. The honourable trade of making camel-litters would, for instance, revive. 7.

Preliminary. —The jurisdiction of this Committee as set A ^ forth in the Press Note is confined to arrangements with in India and during the voyage to the Hedjaz. In the instructions issued to members by the Government of India, however, they were given permission to submit confidential reports on Kamaran and the difficulties of pil grims in the Hedjaz, on the understanding that all reference to the politics of that country should be avoided. We hope that it may be possible to make public that portion of our report which deals with Kamaran. As far as the Hedjaz itself is concerned, we cannot but acquiesce in the propriety of keeping our suggestions confidential. Further, there is a certain class of complaint, e.g., those arising from the fact that the Nedjadis are reactionary and intolerant in matters of religion and are at pains to interfere with certain observances and practices, which have been customary as part of the pilgrimage among Indian and other pilgrims, as to which we consider it undesirable to enter into any detail, as we are satisfied that Muslim opinion throughout India would be strongly against any official representation being made by the Gov ernment of India to the Government of the Hedjaz on the subject. If even diplomatic representations on any of the points which we have specified, are in the least likely to prejudice the harmonious relations that exist at present between the two Governments, we would certainly prefer that no action should be taken. On this understanding we have included in this Chapter one or two matters as to which we recognise that even the most tactful representa tions might be misinterpreted. This Chapter also contains cer tain suggestions in connection with the activities of the British Consul and Indian Pilgrimage Officer in the Hedjaz, but the sub jects are so closely connected that we have considered it best to deal with them together rather than attempt to separate them. 2. The British Consul at Jeddah. —The British Consul at Jeddah is the diplomatic representative of His Britannic Majesty to the King of the Hedjaz, and, as such, is responsible diplomatically for the welfare of the pilgrims not only from India but from the Malay States and other British possessions. 'While we acknowledge the assistance which various Holders of the post have rendered to Indian pilgrims in the past, and in particular the personal interest which Mr. W. H. S. Bird took in all matters affecting the Indian pilgrimage, it is a fact that the British Consul’s activities are, to some extent, curtailed by the restrictions placed upon non-Muslims in the Hedjaz. A non- Muslim Consul cannot visit Mecca and Medina, or indeed travelmore than a few miles beyond the city of Jeddah q other nations who are represented by consuls at J Yn 16 ^ regularly or occasionally, appoint Muslims in that Y&gt; ( • e ^ er suL'fifest that the propriety of takincr similat. a P^city. ^ suggest that the propriety of taking similar action if\r u'* any Muslims on their consular staff, should be br 0 it ^ ave notice of the British Government; and that if thov iY'' to Muslims on their staff, the advisability of making ' 6 a 0 8Uc ^ recruitment of such candidates should be considered ^ th * 3. The Indian Pilgrimage Officer and Vice-Consul - \ the Indian Pilgrimage Officer and Vice-Consul \ V l As . ,l) that the incumbents of the post have, in the' pYt re(0 ^ n ' t!e as the present, done their best according to their capacit Y We ^ tect the interests of Indian pilgrims. We consider ] ° ^ ro that, particularly if it is impossible for the Consul himseYTT’ a Muslim, the status of the Vice-Consul should be raised t0 ^ would be of great advantage-that the incumbent of the post Y * n be in possession of special qualifications and previous trairunY k as that given in the Indian Political. Department, to enabled? holder to have a broader vision and . exercise more influence il 6 he does at present. . ^ 4. The staff of the Pilgrimage Officer.--The staff 0 f tl Indian Pilgrimage Officer must he adequate, particularly t register and hand over passes to pilgrims imlividniliv ° their return to Jeddah, as well a s to secure the plomY refund of deposits. A large proportion of it may, no doubt £ temporary and recruited locally, but both these and the permanent staff should be w T ell acquainted with Bengali and the other languages in use among Indian pilgrims, and for the more res ponsible posts on the permanent staff we suggest that those who already have experience in the pilgrim departments in India would be very suitable recruits, and that their salaries* should be-fixed at a scale adequate to induce them to take up such posts in the Hedjaz for a period of years. Such an interchange of staff between the Consulate and the Haj Committees would, we are satisfied, go far to produce a degree of co-operation which at present is'im possible. 5. Landing at Jeddah.—After passing through the quaran tine station at Kamaran the pilgrim eventually arrives in the harbour at Jeddah. The reports of the British Con.;ul show that until very recently the procedure of landing Indian pilgrims at Jeddah compared very unfavourably with that adopted in the case of Javanese and Malay pilgrims. The captains of the ships ‘conveying pilgrims of th° latter class do not allow' the coolies from Jeddah to board their sups, but unload the luggage of the pilgrims whom they have on board into the sambuks waiting alongside by means of their own crews and the ships’ cranes, whereas, at least until recently, onIndian ships coolies from on shore came on board and seized the pil grims’ luggage indiscriminately and carried it away to the sambuks, with the result that portions of it were frequently lost by the time the pilgrims had disembarked and passed the quarantine station on shore. Attempts have, we understand, been made by the shipping companies to improve the arrangements, but these have not so far been successful. We approve of the suggestion made by the British Consul that the shipping companies engaged in the Indian pilgrimage traffic should be requested to afford the same facilities for the unloading of baggage as are afforded by the Blue Funnel line, namely, that, the ship’s derricks should be employed, and only coolies and boatmen provided by the company allowed on board. Cases have also occurred where, once the pilgrims were on board a sambuk, the crew demanded illegal charges from them for the journey to the shore, even under the nose of the captain of the ship they had just left. From the evidence of witnesses who have landed at Jeddah in the past two years it is clear that this fact has been brought to the notice of the Hedjaz authorities and that they are doing their best to stop the levy of illegal fees. The landing at Jeddah still takes place in sailing boats, as no launches are available for ordinary pilgrims, and the pilgrims are disem barked at a different place from their luggage, so that cases of theft and loss of luggage are not infrequent. We understand that the British Consul has already represented this difficulty to the Hedjaz Government. We would urge however, that the pilgrims should be allowed to land with their luggage. f). Muallims. —On landing at Jeddah the pilgrim is allotted to a muallim, if he has not already got one. We understand that it is the custom for pilgrims to be allotted to muallims in accordance with the district or province from which they come, and that, once they have been so allotted, no change is allowed by the Hedjaz autho rities, as the muallim is made responsible for the person and pro perty of each pilgrim under his charge. We have reason to believe that the Hedjaz Government has already under contempla tion a scheme for abolishing the territorial method of distribution of pilgrims, and that the Javanese pilgrims are actually allowed to do without muallims while in the Hedjaz. We are satisfied that an alteration of the arrangements on similar lines in the case of Indian pilgrims is desirable, and further think that, if pilgrims were given liberty to change their muallims, it would tend to prevent illegal exactions, and that representations to this effect should be made to the Hedjaz Government. 7. Deposit of passes at the Consulate.— On receiving his ' batch of pilgrims, each muallim takes their passes and return tickets to the British Consulate, where he deposits them in return for a receipt and picks them up again for distribution to his clients, when they return to Jeddah on the con-elusion of the ITaj. If our recommendation for the substituti of deposits for return tickets be accepted, the same procedure will he adopted in future, except that the passes will be retained h the pilgrims and only the counter-foils deposited with the Cong/ late. 8. Present security of life and property in the Hediaz - In due course the pilgrims depart under the care of their rmiallims to Mecca and Medina. Here it may be noted that there is abundance of evidence to show that, whereas in the past the pilgrim in the Hedjaz was never safe from danger to life and pro perty, under the present regime, as far as active violence is con cerned, they are at least as safe as they are in their own districts in India. To illustrate this, we would repeat, without in any wav taking responsibility for its accuracy, a story which was reported to us by Mr. Bird, late British Consul at Jeddah, as current in the Hedjaz. A pilgrim returning from Medina noticed a sack which had obviously dropped off a motor car in the desert He proceeded to examine it and, in order to ascertain what it con tained, took out two or three grains of rice from a hole in it. Then, after noting its position as carefully as he could, he pro ceeded on his return journey to Jeddah and reported the matter to the police authorities, who, instead of thanking him, actually punished him severely for touching property which did not belong to him. Even if this story be not true, it is interesting as a proof of the absolute security which at present exists in the Hedjaz- Twenty years ago the first act of a pilgrim on reaching Jeddah was to purchase a rifle to protect himself on the journeys to Mecca and Medina. Under present conditions he never thinks of arming himself at all. 9. Water supply and motor transport. —In addition to securing the absolute safety of the roads between Jeddah and Mecca, and Jeddah and Medina, the present regime has also done much to alleviate other troubles, such as scarcity of water, from which Indian ni'erims u^ed to suffer. A second condenser has been installed at Jeddah and adequate water of reasonable quality is always available there, though it has to he paid for. Similarly the water supply at Mecca has been greatly in'proved and we understand that a number of new wells have been dug on the road to Medina. Motor transport is available from Jeddah to both Mecca and Medina, and each car is carefully inspected before departure to ensure that it carries no more than the proper number of passengers, as well as the necessary spares and supplies of petrol, water, etc. We understand that some attempts have been made to make the road to Mecca more suitable for motor traffic but without any great success. We have also heard , complaints that many of the drivers drive at an excessive speed. We wou'd suggest that this also should be controlled.5 10 . Control of MuaUims.-The muallims are carefully supervised and made responsible for the safety of all the pilgrims in their charge. New regulations have recently been issued to prevent their stealing the property of pil. grims who die while m their charge; and, though they naturally cannot be entirely prevented from making illicit exactions from the ^pilgrims, prompt action is taken to punish them when such abuses are brought to the notice of the authorities. A list of the authorised charges and fees is drawn up every year by the Government and published, and, though the scale of fees has largely increased and the amount taken by the Government appears, as will be shown later, exorbitant, the very fact of the publication of such a list of charges has gone a long way to facilitate complaints and so prevent extortion. 11. Medical assistance. —No great improvement has been effected either in the sanitary conditions of the towns of Jeddah and Mecca or in the public medical services provided by the Hedjaz Government. Conservancy is practically an unknown art, and it is still more or ‘ less recognised as a sentence of death to be sent into the Hedjaz Government’s hospital at Jeddah. Private medical practitioners do exist in Jeddah, Mecca and Medina, but they are not well-qualified. For this reason the Government of India has, in the past, been good enough to provide, on a limited scale, medical assistance for the benefit of its pilgrims in the Hedjaz. One qualified doctor is per manently attached to the Consulate at Jeddah and proceeds to Mecca as the pilgrims gather there. Arrangements have now been made for the permanent renting of a house in Mecca for him, and we understand that he is now assisted by a second medical officer recruited for the pilgrim season only. The medical needs of pilgrims are, however, great, while they are in the Hedjaz, and we consider that it would be proper for the Government of India to supply further medical assistance for the benefit of Indian pilgrims during the period of the pilgrimage only. A dispensary already exists at Jeddah with a sub-assistant surgeon and the medical officer of the Consulate in charge. We recommend that at Mecca there should be two medical dispensaries, located in suitable build ings permanently hired or bought in principal streets, one on each side of the Kaaba, and that each should be staffed by one assistant surgeon, one sub-assistant surgeon and one compounder. The present medical officer from Jeddah could take charge of one of these as assistant surgeon during the busy season. We also con sider that an Indian doctor should be made available in Medina with a compounder and a permanent building. Permanent buildings are necessary in all cases, as otherwise it is difficult for pilgrims, even if they make enquiries, to avail themselves of the doctors* services. Private practice should be strictly forbidden in the case6 of all these medical officers, as recommended by the British C during the Haj season. The total medical staff required wiiu’ two assistant surgeons, four sub-assistant surgeons and four ^ pounders. It is desirable that some at least of these shouldT acquainted with the Bengali language. It should be recognieea that these doctors should serve as assistants to the Indian PiWiin Officer and be authorised to communicate with him, when nec? sary. f 12. Taxation and Jeddah sanitary dues.— The chief grievance of pilgrims against the Hedjaz authorities is traceable to the enormous increase that has been made since the War in those heads of taxation which affect them, if q le amount the pilgrim has to pay as steamer fare has doubled since 1913, it is probable that the amount he has to pay to the Hediaz Government in the form of direct and indirect taxes has quadrupled during the same period. Article 97 of the International Sanitary Convention makes it compulsory for the Jeddah sanitary dues to be paid by the captain of the ship : these are therefore collected with the passage money in India. At present the rate is Rs. 15 per head and no reduction is made in the case of infants and children In the past it used to he customary for quite a large number of pilgrims, often as many as twenty-five per cent., to be exempted altogether from the payment of these dues on account of poverty. Now' no such exemptions are granted. In our opinion it would be proper for infants under three to be exempted and for half rates to be charged, as in the case of fares, in respect of children up to twelve. The rate of Rs. 15 per head is extortionately high and, as practically no sanitary services in the way of quarantine are performed in respect of pilgrim ships, nor is any staff beyond the ordinary Port Health Officers retained for the purpose, it is clear that hardly one rupee out of the Rs. 15 charged can actually he expended on any sanitary services in connection with the disembarkation and medical examination of pilgrims, so that at least Rs. 14 must he clear profit to the State. As there is also a poll-tax on all pilgrims to the holy shrines varying between Rs. 10 and Rs. 8, there is no moral justification whatsoever for so high a quarantine fee. It is on record that so long ago as in 1878, when proposals were made by the Hedjaz Government to levy a combined quarantine and poll-tax of about one rupee four annas (ten piastres), Mr. Moncrieff, the then British Consul, made the strongest representations on the subject, with the result that the fee w T as retained at a very moderate figure during the whole period of the Turkish regime. This encourages us to hope that similar re presentations may, at the present time, when the case is so very much stronger, result in a substantial reduction. In other direc tions taxation by the Hedjaz Government has operated to increase the cost of the pilgrimage very considerably. The motor car faresare so fixed that practically half of what is paid by the pilgrim goes to the State and, as the cost of a seat in a car from Jeddah to Medina and back is about &lt;£15, it is obvious that this form of tax must produce an enormous revenue. The State similarly takes a large percentage of the fares charged for camel hire. We estimate roughly that even the poorest pilgrim, who does not travel by motor, rwt at the present time be paying at least Rs. 100 in taxation to the State in this manner, while richer pilgrims pay not less than Rs. 200. We realise that it might be a very delicate matter to make representations on the subject of taxation generally, though it is obviously in the interests of the revenue of the State, not to raise taxation to so high a figure as to discourage the pilgrimage and so “kill the goose that lays the golden eggs” ; but there is a very strong case for the reduction of the Jeddah sanitary dues, particularly in view of the fact that it is obviously not contemplated in the Inter national Sanitary Convention that those dues should b'e more than enough to meet the cost of the services supplied. Article 55 of the Convention lays down that each Government undertakes to have a single sanitary tariff only, the charges of which shall be moderate. If this Article cannoi be quoted as binding on the Government of the Hedjaz in respect of the pilgrim traffic, it at least furnishes an argument for use in that connection. We therefore urge that diplomatic representations should be made to secure a drastic reduc tion in the present Jeddah sanitary dues. 13. Postal facilities. —At present we understand that letters and parcels to and from the Hedjaz and India go via Egypt as steamer services are available by that route all the year round. The result is that a letter takes something like a month to reach the Hedjaz from India. We suggest that arrangements should be made during the season for specially superscribed correspondence to be sent by the pilgrim boats direct to and from Bombay and Karachi. This should reduce the time taken by at least half. Facilities for the despatch of letters and parcels by registered post already exist, but^ owing to the time taken by such letters at present the service is very little utilised. Similarly it would be a great advantage to pilgrims, if a postal money order service and the D. R. I. tele gram system w 7 ere available to and from the Hedjaz. 14 Banking facilities.-We have considered whether it is necessary to arrange tor any additional pilgrims in connection with the exchange or transmis^ if their money. Exchange between rupees and the HedjK sre. t —r M ETlSpS H £S i’'.»&gt; «• M “8 Jeddah and Cook’s circular drafts are obtainable in the Indian port* of embarkation and easily cashed there. Various Indian mercan tile firms also have branches both in India and Jeddah and ‘hundis’ which can be cashed in Mecca or Medina, are readily available! We understand, however, that pilgrims are making less use than they formerly did of this method of transmitting money owing to the present safety of property in the Hedjaz. We consider that® beyond making widely known the possibility of transmitting^ money in the manner specified, no further action is necessary. 15. Haj Committees in the Hedjaz.— Many witnesses have suggested the institution of Haj Committees in Jeddah, Mecca and Medina. As a matter ol fact a Haj Com mittee, whose duty it is to co-operate with the Indian Pilgrimage Officer, already exists at Jeddah, though it is clear from the fact that this is not known even to well-informed pilgrims that its activities cannot be very extensive. The late British Consul, Mr. Bird, has pointed out to us the undesirability of attempting to constitute Haj Committees on any but the most informal lines, and we are satisfied that any such attempt would lead to difficul ties with the Hedjaz authorities. We understand that -the present un-official Haj Committee at Jeddah co-operates with the Consul in arranging the departure of pilgrims, including Persian and Afghan pilgrims, in the order in which they return to Jeddah. It might be suggested that it should also take an interest in the pil grims at the time they land, and assist them to get their kit through the Customs. In Mecca and Medina we realise that it is impos sible to form Haj Committees even on the lines of that existing at Jeddah, but if there be Indian residents at those places who are willing to form an association to help the Indian pilgrims as cor respondents of the Jeddah Committee, it appears that this could be done without objection and it would certainly be desirable from the pilgrims’ point of view. 16. Housing accommodation at Jeddah. — Housing accom modation at Jeddah is both insanitary and unsatisfactory, though it is available at a price. While the pilgrims are on their way to the Haj, the town is not very full, but while, on their return, they are waiting for ships, it becomes ex ceedingly congested and the price charged naturally goes up. Endeavours are made by the Hedjaz authorities to prevent the town becoming overfull by stopping the caravans returning from Mecca until some of the ships have embarked their passengers and left. This is a step in the right direction, but it is likely to be less easy to carry out the arrangement successfully, now that motor transport has become almost universal, than it was when camels were the ordinary means of travel. The overhead chnrges on a camel are practically nil, while on a motor car they are consider^able. Thus it is a fact that a large number of Indian pilgrims are likely to continue to arrive in Jeddah immediately after the Haj, as they have in the past few years, and to have to wait there for a week or ten days till their turn comes to embark for India. It is the present practice for large numbers of the poorer pilgrims at this time not to endeavour to seek house accommodation at all, r^ut to make themselves such shelters as they can on the desert bordering the town or even to lie without such shelters about the streets. It is doubtful whether this produces as bad a state of affairs as might be supposed, as, in the case of the pilgrim who is still strong enough to stand the sun, a rough shelter outside the town is probably at least as sanitary as accommodation in a con- nested room in the heart of the town would be. Several witnesses have suggested the provision of musafirkhanas for the accommoda tion of Indian pilgrims at Jeddah. One witness who had con siderable experience of the Hedjaz, on being consulted on this point, pertinently remarked that such musafirkhanas would only |)e used to their full capacity for a few days during the Haj and that the Committee had better think of providing adequate accom modation at the Indian ports of departure before it worried itself about musafirkhanas in Jeddah. We are disposed to agree that no case can be made out for the construction of permanent expen sive buildings for this purpose. If, however, the necessary funds were available to the Haj Committees, it would be reasonable for them to provide a temporary camp on the outskirts of Jeddah for the accommodation of the more needy Indian pilgrims. We would also suggest that the absence of accommodation for pilgrims at Jeddah might be brought to the notice of Indian philanthropists. We believe that the Hedjaz authorities would not be likely to raise any objection to the construction of musafirkhanas or camps for such a purpose by private individuals, though they might claim the ultimate responsibility for their management. 17. Wakf properties.—In this connection we would like to point out that we have reason to believe that there are certain icakf properties intended for the use of Indian pilgrims both at Jeddah and Mecca, but ^ that most ^ of these have got into improper hands, and, instead of being utilised for the purpose for which they were originally in tended, are being dealt with as the private property of those who happen to be in possession. We are happy to state that we know of one case where wakf property had so been converted to other uses for a large number of years, but, as the result of inquiries made by a friend of the donor, the facts were proved to the satis faction of the Hedjaz Government and the property restored to its legitimate use. We recommend that the British Consul should be asked to endeavour to compile a list of all such u akf proper les With a brief history, as far as it can be traced, of each case. ^ven10 if the full facts cannot be discovered in the Hedjaz, it is quite pro. bable that, if such a list were sent to the Central Haj Committee in India, it would be in a position to trace either the original donor or his descendents and make out a case to satisfy the Hedjaz authorities. 18. Arrangements for return passages.—In order to ensure that the Indian pilgrims arriving at Jeddah on the returjJ journey will be embarked within a reasonable time, the Consul has inaugurated a system by which their names are recorded at the Consulate in the order of their arrival and they are provided with shipping accommodation in the same order. Persian and Afghan pilgrims who travel by the Indian boats are included in this arrangement, which is re- ccmised by the Hedjaz authorities and is carried out with the co operation of the steamship companies, the muallims and the local Haj Committee. It has resulted in the checking of many abuses. There is reason to believe that formerly it was by no means un common for the agents of steamship companies in Jeddah to give preference to persons desiring to purchase single tickets to India over their own return-ticket holders, as thus they obtained “new” money- The system of universal deposits which we have recommended will, we are satisfied, greatly facilitate the working of this arrangement. We have heard of cases in which during the past two years it has led to abuses. According to several witnesses, muallims are in the habit of charging each pilgrim a fee of Rs 2 or more for the recovery of his pass from the Consulate, and also take the opportunity, while they are in possession of the passes, to insist that all their demands for money, whether legitimate or not, shall be complied with. For this reason we are of opinion that, while there is no objection to the passes being collected from the muallims at the time of landing, at the time of departure they should be returned to the individual pilgrim in person at the Consulate, in the presence of the muallim, unless he has deposited his pass himself. Admittedly this will necessi tate the recruitment of additional temporary staff for the purpose, but it will prevent the muallims being in a position to bring pressure to bear upon their pilgrims at the very time vyhen the latter are least able, in their anxiety to get away, to resist extor- tionate demands. 19. Means of identification.— As already suggested, the passes will be in duplicate, the duplicate being retained at the Consulate and the original being retained by the pilgrim. Each will bear either a photograph, a signature, or a thumb impression. Where a photograph exists, identification at the time when the pilgrims return to book their passages at ' the Consulate at Jeddah will, of course, be easy. ^ In other cases it has occurred to us that, in order to prevent claims being made\ ■ the wrong persons without possibility of detection by the con sular staff, the details as to the next-of-kin should be entered only in the duplicate and not in the original pass, so that, on a pilgrim returning to the consulate, it would be possible for the staff there to put to him certain questions, his answers to which would prove whether he was the rightful holder of the pass or not. It is true ^*11 nit the adoption of this suggestion would have the disadvantage of making the information given by the original pass less com- nlete awf we are not quite sure that it would fit in with the recent regulations issued by the Hedjaz authorities for the control of the muallims : but the suggestion might, we think, be communicated to the British Consul for his remarks. It is based on the system in force among the Indian banking firms which, in issuing hundis to illiterate pilgrims, arrange with them that they shall, in order to prevent false claims, use as pass-words the names of certain of their relatives which are not written in the documents which remain in the pilgrims’ possession and cannot therefore be known to a stranger who is in wrongful possession of such documents- 20. Publicity.—We hope that, by the arrangements we have suggested elsewhere to apprise Indian pilgrims of the fact that they can claim assistance and help from the British Consul, the Indian Pilgrimage Officer and the special staff under him, they will be in a position to keep more in touch with those who can help them than they do at present. We would recommend that the offices of all those concerned should be marked by signboards in the prin cipal languages used by Indian pilgrims and their location altered as infrequently as possible.

Henderson.—(Received June 10) (No. 177.) „ , Slr ’ctvptt . , , x T Jedda, May 15, 1931. M.\&lt; h l wrote my despatch J\o. 108 Of the 23rd March, the exchange situation in this country has gone through various vicissitudes, of which it is now possible to give a more or less connected account, although no account by an outsider can be complete or at all points accurate owing to the amazing difficulty ot obtaining coherent information in the conditions which prevail. 2. The arrangements with the Dutch Bank, as the Netherlands Trading society is popularly called, worked for five or six weeks on the lines described m my previous despatch, i.e., the bank sold drafts on abroad in exchano*e for riyal s at 10 to the £ sterling, plus a small premium of current piastres, and charged tor the draft a high commission, the normal rate of which was at first ,, P® 1 but was afterwards raised to 2 per cent. The currency remained taurly fixed at the legal rate of £1 gold sterling to 10 rivals, equalling 220 current nickel piastres. 3 About the middle ol April, however, the arrangement with the Dutch Bank broke down, apparently for two reasons, namely, that the Government was working on a limit of £10,000 in gold for redemption purposes and threw back on to the market an excessive quantity of the redeemed silver and nickel. At this stage the Government would appear to have relaxed the prohibition of the export o gold, though I cannot discover that any public announcement was made ; and the bank attempted to carry on by selling drafts for half gold and half silver, &amp;c. This did not last very long, and presently the bank more or less shut down its exchange business. In Jedda it is difficult even to ascertain at any given moment whether a bank is open or closed. 4- In any case it was now close to the pilgrimage day, which fell on the 21th April, and which put a stop to all big business from a day or two before the actual date of the standing on Arafat until at least five days later. The pilgrims lad all arrived before the 25th April, and their advent, naturally, brought money to replenish temporarily the Government chest. The demand for currency for retail operations is also naturally greatest at the height of the pilgrimage. These reasons probably account for the fact that, although the riyal has been wobbly since the middle oi April, there has been no spectacular depreciation. It has stood at rates varying from a little over the legal rate of 10 to a rate of 12 to the £ sterling of late. 5. shortly before the pilgrimage day. on the other hand, the nickel currency broke loose from all standards, and as' it plays an important part in retail business great uneasiness prevailed. It was accentuated by the publication of a communique on the 23rd April to the effect that, in view of the frauds which had been practised, the Government had decided to accept nickel at the market rate, which would be announced each morning by the financial authorities. This was followed by a considerable dislocation of retail trade, and, some days later, there was something ot a panic in the bazaars of Jedda and Mecca. Piastres went to very low rates, and at one moment all but lost effective value as currency. The Government took stop-gap measures in Jedda to withdraw nickel by collecting supplies of rice, &amp;c., and selling in a shop or shops of their own. I do not know what happened at Mecca, except that prices in piastres went up considerably, much to the discomfiture of pilgrims. 6. A meeting was held in Mecca on the 1st May to consider the whole situation, and a new communique issued in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 1st May, which actually appeared on the 3rd May, announced that the Government had opened shops to change nickel for riyals at the legal rate of 22 to the rival. V arious other remedies were adopted about the same time, notably an arrange- [165 k—2]2 £24,000 of nickel, the Government putting up tH.UUU, tlie merchants the rest! each of them being assessed at a stated amount. 1 he nickel thus collected was to be held by the Ministry of Finance, and repayment of the money ; levied, pn the public was to be made at a later date. It was fuither dec ided about the 7th May to close all the shops of the money changers, who are accused of rigging the currency market. , , , . . , , . 7. The measures taken have rehabilitated nickel tor the time being and, as I have said, the riyal has not fallen undul\ low. ( Nevertheless, the situation is obviously precarious, for the crisis has occurred at what should be the period of greatest' prosperity. The months between now and the beginning of the next H V_/ ijl uxxy ^^ ^ ^ ^ i t/llC IIGXL pilgrimage season l^ite in the autumn, when the 19d2 pilgrims will begin to , must necessarily be very lean months. The manager of the Dutch Bank . aiclllnoi’rmorl man towards the Clld of Anril but ho 1,704.1 arrive was a was it very disillusioned man towards the end of April, but he was then negotiating a fresh arrangement with the Government. He did not tell me its exact nature, but he said that the Government would have to put up £60,000 in gold to (jack it. ^fter the festival he did not reopen his bank for exchange business, and rpmours were afloat that the bank contemplated retirement from the country. On the 10th May, however, Mr. Jacobs told me that he was still negotiating. He no longer had any doubt that the Government could dispose of any necessary amount of gold up to £60.000, but he said he was. awaiting the King's guarantee o| the transaction, whatever it might be. He complained bitterly of the changeableness and incapacity of the Government. He put much of the blarn^ on Mr. Philby, who, he said, Had been dangling before the Kino 1 the id^a that it would be an easy matter to arrange, with his (Mr. Philby’s 1 ) L - L '- ■ d ' from my ken than the matters which 1 have attempted to summarise above in a form more intelligible than most of the reports on which my account is based. There are supposed to be, for instancy some £#0,000 wmrth of nickel coins in circulation but rumours of inflation by the importation of forged coins have been current and have helped to destroy confidence. Another obscure factor is the difficulty of popularising in Nejd the use of the silver and nickel coinage current in the Hejaz. 9 You will doubtless, be struck by the smallness of the amounts on which these locally important crises turn. It needs at most, it appears, £60 000 in gold to sustain a silver currency which, is legal tender to an unlimited amount Operations in nickel tp a total of £#0,000 can throw the market into convulsions’ As I have observed in at least one Previous report, it is characteristic of this country that tfie Government are reduced to all sorts of shifts to cope with what thatlK 0 dT St r dard V re ^ Ulte * ma11 ,iabilities - is not the first time that Ibn &gt;saud has been in low water, but I doubt whether he has ever been so embarrassed or had so little credit.

Sir, ilth reference to letter No.B 3233/206V26 of the Wth June from this department regarding a request from King Ibn Saud for ^ assistance His Majesty's Government in estahlishing a British Bank as a State Bank in the Hejaz, 1 am directed by Mr.Secretary Henrerson to trananit to you, to be 1 id before the Lords Commissione re of His M jesty's Treasury, the accompanying copy of a despatch from Sir A.Ryan on the general and financial situation in the Hejas-Nejd. Sir • j’iyan draws attention to certain factors in the pro cent situation in the Hejaz-Nejd which appear to him to be disquieting since, in the event of further deterioration, they might endanger the stability of the present regime in that country. He states in paragraph 6 that the crux of the matter i s the financial situation. Their Lordships will be aware from his despatches Nos. 108 and 177 of the 23rd March and 15th May, copies of which were enclosed in Foreign Office letters Nos.K 2064/^064/^6 0 ** **1© 9th May and E 3024/2064/25 oi the 30th June, that the financial and economic position of the country was unsatisfactory, and it seems clear from his subsequent reports that it is now one of considerable gravity. Henderson is of opinion therefore that, in considering what reply ehould be returned to King Ibn Baud’s urgent request to His Secretary to the Treasury.His meaty’e Government for assistance in obtaining the vires of a British bank, reported in Sir A.Hyan’s telegram of the 19th June, it is necessary to bear in mind the possibility that a financial crisis in King Ibn Baud’s dominions may sell lead to a collapse of his control. 3. Such a collapse would, in hr.Henderson’s view, b0 C ° n ary to 4116 Political interests of His Majesty's Oevernment. The disappearance of a settled and friendly Government from the Hejaz and Hejd and the lapse of those countries irto a state of disturbance and disorganisation could not fail to react unfavourably uoon the various and important Political problems with which His Majesty's Government are concerned in Arabia. 4. It seems clear, on the other hand, from Sir A.Ryan’s reports that considerable financial risk would attend the acce tnnee by any bank of King Ibn Baud’s proposals. 6. Mr.Henderson will be glad to receive at an early date such observations as Their Lordships may wish to offer regarding the reply ,hich Sir A.Ryan should be instructed to siake to King Ibn Baud’s request for the assistance of His Majesty's G 0 Vermont. Should Their Lordshins think it desirable to approach any British bank in this matter, they will recollect that the British fi™ of Oellatly, Hankey and •mreany have maintained a banking business in the Hejaz for a considerable number of year*.

Section I. i i9 3l 1 i[E 3267/1600/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received June 23.) (]\o. 200. Secret.) Sir ’ . Jedda, May 28, 1931. I HA\ E had occasion in various recent reports to refer to various indications of a weakening of Ibn Saud's position in this country. Although the available data are meagre and uncertain, I think the time has come to attempt a review of the King s situation on the eve of an absence from the Hejaz which may last several months, if he carries out his intention of going to Neid, as reported in mv telegram No. 141 of the 20th May. 2. Ibn Saud imposed himself on the Hejaz by force of arms. He maintains himself by force of personality and by a reserve of material force responding to his personal direction and still capable of being applied with sufficient effect at any particular point to enable him to cope with anything short of a fairly general movement of opposition. Such a movement could hardly originate among the 'parasitic populations of places like Mecca and Jedda, although their inhabitants ‘would almost certainly welcome a change of regime. The tribes have no such cohesion as to produce of themselves an organised movement in opposition to a King whose name and past exploits inspire respect and fear. 3. So far so good, from Ibn Saud's point of view. Nevertheless, he has to reckon with more remote factors. One hears vaguely, but somewhat persistently, of a restive spirit in the north of the Hejaz. Hail and even Medina are potential centres of disaffection. Behind them are the Transjordan frontier and countries ruled by members of the Shereefian family, a family which, though eliminated at present from the Hejazi scheme of things, would be the natural rallying centre for elements bold enough to try conclusions with the present regime. Such elements may emerge in the north, even though it be impossible at present to locate or identify them. Their boldness would strike an echo not of equal boldness, but of sympathy, in Mecca and Jedda, where people chafe under restrictions and recent “ Nejdification.” 4. The King's religious prestige has diminished as his temporal power has grown. He tends to fall between two stools. He is no longer extreme enough for Wahhabis of the old school. He is too Wahhabi for Hejazis and for the majority of alien Moslems who frequent the Hejaz at pilgrimage time. Native and foreign Moslems react on each other to some extent. The desecration of shrines since the Wahhabi invasion is a cause of widespread feeling shared by foreign pilgrims, who have venerated these from afar, and natives accustomed not only &amp; to venerate them, but, in some cases, to make money out of them in the past. 5. There are other factors in this nebulously alarming picture, like economic depression, maladministration, and an almost desperate financial situation. As for economic depression, the Hejaz cannot escape from the repercussion of “ world causes.'’ Their effect is manifested in the reduction of the overseas pilgrimage to less than half the numbers for last year. Maladministration is too familiar in a country like this to be in itself a potent cause of discontent. It impresses foreigners'more than it is consciously felt by the bulk of the native population. The dangerous feature in connexion with my present subject is not so much the badness of the administration as the quasi-paralysis which threatens many of those responsible for it, owing to the increasing difficulty of devisino- shifts to get out of difficulties. Mr. Philby, that most charitable of critics when he is dealing with the affairs of this country, dwelt particularly on this aspect of the situation in our last conversation. He convicted the King himself of floundering, of making mistakes through ignorance, and of clinging to authority amid a posse of advisers, all the more capable of whom were worn out with overwork. He remarked on the complete occupation of the Emir Feisal. to whom it was thought last autumn that the King might delegate some of his powers [165 z—1]6. The crux of the matter is the financial situation. I bn Saud has no doubt always lived up to his income and a bit beyond it. The trou )le now is that he can only escape the most serious embarrassment by cutting his cloth to fit a greatly diminished income, again because of the slump m the pilgrimage, which has been too great to be balanced by increased taxation, and w inn is nardly likely to be repaired next year, whatever later prospects may )e. Me and his family are naturally extravagant. The expenditure, for instance, on a move to Riadh is enormous in combarison with resources. This extravagance m itself causes adverse comment. The most intelligent foieign pilgrim ha\e met this year remarked on the poorness of the lighting of the sacred precinct at Mecca as contrasted with the installations in royal houses, and was very much inclined to ask generally why Ibn Sand should aftect to miscellaneous State or other purposes money brought by Moslems coming here as of light to finfil a religious obligation. Royal extravagance in personal expenditure might, noweyei, pass, if royal requirements for other purposes were not so great a drain. T he King s strength and prestige must depend on his ability to pay, pa\, ]iay. An Islamised Dutchman here, not hostile to him, has expressed to me doubt as to yvhether the King means to go to Nejd at all this summer. TIis doubt is probably unfounded but his reasons for it are interesting. Custom demands that all who come to the King’s threshold in Riadh should receive food, clothing and gifts. What an excellent plan, then, for His Majesty to put it about that he is going thither; let the expectant Bedouin turn their steps in that direction also; retire to Taif; and leave an eldest son to gratify as best he may the hopes of the Bedouins! Mr. Philby again, in the conversation to which I have already referred, asked me. with unusual diffidence, wdmt I thought of the financial outlook, and had nothing hopeful to suggest w T hen I said I could not see where any money was to come from until late in the autumn. 7. There is little in this despatch that I have not already adverted to m special connexions in other reports. In putting all the facts together in one statement, I may have painted too gloomy a picture. It is not the first time in Ibn Sand’s history that he has been confronted wuth difficulties, nor is there anything in his record to suggest that he would easily relinquish what he has gained. He has often been hard up, and contrived to carry on. His w T hole position was endangered by the 1929 rebellion, and he came out on top. My object is not to suggest that he is now' on the point of collapse in the Hejaz, but to show that his position here rests on foundations so unstable that a strong push from any direction might upset it, and that his downfall, if it could be compassed' vould not he unwelcome to the population, however incapable the most visible emeiits may be of compassing it themselves. My intelligent pilgrim, admittedly a hostile witness, unlike Mr. Philbv and the Dutchman, was full of the Kind’s unpopularity, and mentioned a prophecy, of which I had not previously heard, that Il-n Saud s rule in the Hejaz would last seven years from the start Mv French colleague tells me that he hears the same tales as myself of unsettled he.ijg in the Northern Hejaz, and agrees wdth me in thinking that their importance hes more ,r their persistency than in the value of particular reports. , e urafting this despatch I heard that a council of representatives in some sense elective, has been convened to meet at Mecca on or about the 1st June to consider matters affecting the general interests of the country.

' T BRITISH LEGATION (E 2984/2984/25) JEDDA, EI DENT IAIj . May 22nd, 1951 Sir In paragraph 4 of my despatch No. 13 of January $ 12th relative to the celebration of the anniversary of Ibn Sa f ud ! s accession, I supplied some information, which at the time did not appear important enough to record separately, regarding the attempt to create the beginnings of a regular army on European lines in this country. I have followed this experiment v/ith some interest, as I was struck with the zeal and intelligence which Faudhi Bey appeared to be bringing to his task. He told me himself something of his plans for utilizing the human material available and establishing inter alia a school for Non Commissionei^ Officers. He seemed to be making something at any rate of the infantry arm and it became a common thing to see parties of the men being efficiently drilled just outside the town. 2. It was reported to me a short time ago that Faudhi Bey had resigned because he could not get attention paid to his proposals and because orders were given over his head to those under his comraand. I had already noticed that there was no longer any drilling within sight of the Legation. I now learn from what I believe to be an authentic source that Faudhi Bey was dismissed as a result of intrigues against him, in which a considerable part v/as played by one Hamdi Bey, Officer Commanding tne garrison in Jedda. The scandalmongers suggested that Faudhi Bey was intriguing with partisans of the Sherifian family and that he had been promised by the Soviet representative a bribe of His Majesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.* • 8gs of £1,000,000, no less, to procure the downfall of Ibn Sa’ud. A more amusing story is that he wrote a letter to a lady in Constantinople, the daughter of a Turkish Pasha living in the nejas, suing for her hand and offering as a recommendation that, having become a n -.minister for Var' at the age of 35 or so, he might aspire to the highest things and would end as a King. This incautiously worded appeal to feminine vanity is said to have involved the wooer in suspicion. 3. Faudhi Bey is in fact, I understand, a very ambitious person and it is not inconceivable that he may have been in correspondence with the enemies of Ibn Sa f ud. There is, however, no proof of this that I know of and he is certainly a trained officer with ideas of organization. The recent episode augurs ill for the success of the King’s efforts to build up a regular army. He has now had two organizers in a space of some months. If, as my latest informant states, the Hamdi Bey mentioned above has been definitely appointed to the vacant post, the prospects of success will be poorer than ever. He was in the Turkish Army but I doubt whether he ever rose much above the rank of corporal or sergeant. He comes I think from Kurdistan, but of this I am not certain. He appears to have little education. I should judge him to be a useful man in a scrap but useless as an organizer and unlikely to inspire confidence in the other officers who have passec. into Ibn Sa’ud’s service. I had already heard of his capacity -tor intrigue and have reason to believe that he h£' a hand in the doings which led up to the disintegration o^ tne ---ejaz Air Force.

Henderson.—(Received April :&amp;).) 193! (No. 126.) ^ r-: Sir, Jedda, April 2, 1931. I HAVE the honour to state that Sheikh Yussuf Yasin called on me on the 1st April to talk over privately the general state of the relations between His Majesty s Government and Ibn Baud. He had proposed this visit, without indicating its object, at the end of a personal letter informing me of the settlement of the question of the arrears due to the Eastern Telegraph Company. When he came, he explained that he had hung his request to see me on to that matter, because there was a connexion between it and the much more general purpose he now had in view. He had thought of putting what he had to say in writing, but the King had preferred that he should do it by word of mouth. 2. The sheikh expatiated, in the kind of language to which we are accustomed, on Ibn Baud's desire for sincere friendship with and his reliance on Great Britain. From a general statement, of which this was the padding, I extracted four points, which, after hearing it, I enumerated for the purposes of my reply. They were as follows :— (1) The King and his Government had of late been reduced to a state of per plexity by the severe attitude in the recent past of His Majesty's Government and myself. They were anxious lest this attitude should reflect a change of policy towards this country. (2) The severity in question had been exhibited more particularly in connexion with the Transjordan frontier question. (In this part of his statement, the sheikh spoke of the frontier question as one in which his Government regarded themselves as being the injured party.) (3) Similar severity had marked my representations in connexion with the Eastern Telegraph Company claim. (4) The sheikh hinted, rather than said, that my own recent language had been peculiarly stiff and rigorous and had contributed to the disquietude of the King and the Hejazi Government. 3. I replied at considerable length to Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, thinking that it would be useful to speak to him candidly, though temperately, provided I confined myself to personal expressions of opinion. The general tenor of the conversation was more important than its details and it is therefore unnecessary to record what passed, except in brief outline. 4. Having isolated Sheikh Yussuf's points as above, I took them in reverse order. I explained my personal position as being that of a Minister who had been appointed here in rather unusual circumstances in order to promote the growth or good relations already existing. I had held in agreement with the King and Fuad Bey Hamza that frankness, even if it sometimes entailed disagreeably strong language, was the best diplomacy. If my methods led to the failure of my efforts, I should not shrink particularly from being relieved of a post which had its disadvantages, despite my interest in my work and the kindness which I had received. 5. Turning to particular questions, I reminded Bheikh \ussuf that I had discussed many questions of importance since the beginning of February, and that the two he had named were the only two which had given rise to serious trouble. The others had not all been settled, but some of them had been disposed of and the rest were following a normal course. 6. I had, I said, taken a strong line on the question of the Eastern Telegraph Companv, simplv because it had gone on for years and had become a scandal, owing to the failure of the Hejazi Postal Administration to carry out its obligations under the agreement. 7. I recapitulated the history of the Transjordan frontier question through out the period during which I had dealt with it. My ultimate conversation with [88 ff—4] No. April 29, 1931. Section 4 ] * S 7' 35542 Sheikh Yussuf Yasin early in February had been fairly satisfactory. J us t ^ ^ that time, however, His Majesty’s Government had been strongly impressed by a report from Captain Glubb, whose views were endorsed by all other competent observers in Transjordan. They considered it necessary to make the strongest possible representations and after mature consideration of every material factor including my latest conversation, they had decided that it was imperative to take a strong line. 8. I told Sheikh Yussuf that I was a talkative man. He would have noticed^ that, except for two passing references, I had kept complete silence on this question since my audience on the 2nd March. The reason for that was that His Majesty’s Government were themselves dealing with the matter. I } la d 110 authority to discuss it further. If I were to express my personal opinion it would be that the recent communications from the Hejazi Government had been unsatisfactory. The matter was, however, out of my hands and I could not say what its outcome would be. 9. I then took Sheikh Yussuf’s first point. I said that there was no general change in His Majesty’s Government towards Ibn Sand. Nevertheless, particular questions might affect the relations of States, if they were of sufficient importance The Eastern Telegraph Company question was not of that importance. The Transjordan question might be. Even so, it was the practice of His Majesty's Government to deal as far as possible with all questions, even the most important on their individual merits. They had not, for instance, allowed the Transjordan question to stand in the way of Nuri Pasha’s visit as they might have done even though they were no longer directly concerned in the negotiations for which he was coming. They had, like the Hejazi Government, given no publicity to the existence of an acute controversy. Had they let it be known, Ibn Sand nih lit have sustained damage, e.q., it would have affected the Indian pilgrimaoe the only element-in the whole of this year's pilgrimage which seemed likely to°be un to last year’s strength. ' 1 10 . As for myself, I said, I had continued to discuss other questions which were already in hand. The only change I had made was that I had delayed certain communications pending a settlement of the one capital question I had been at pains to avoid any fresh cause of quarrel, e.g., I had in one case acted 1 y th great restraint oyer a new non-political question, that of the Government cnauneurs. We then had some conversation on that subject, on which 1 have reported separately. vc v, H' main object throughout this conversation was to impress Sheikh 1 ussuf with the extreme importance of the Transjordan frontier question without molving myself in any discussion of its recent phases. Though perturbed over it, he gave me the impression of thinking that it had ceased to be acute as for SJ *«*• “ wp »«re £ to the KW and to o W w n w was ea I ing 1 aske(1 him t0 convev m y respects I have. &amp;c.

Henderson.—{Received April 21 ) (No. 108.) r ’ y Sir, Jpddn AJnv^li O*-} 1 I HAD occasion in a recent despatch regarding the siiuatwn between the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Hejazi Government to refer to the exchange crisis m this country in February. Being now able to give a somewhat clearer view, I think it may be useful to sum up all the facts known to me in a separate despatch. r • 2 ' d A ^ y °V- ^ re aware ’ the . currency system of this country rests on a double basis, the English gold so\eieign and the silver riyal, the equivalence of which is legally fixed at 10 riyais to the £ sterling. There is a large floating supply of gold and the face value of riyais in circulation is estimated at from £150,000 to £180,000. The value of silver in the riyal is said to be about -/10 at present prices. It is reckoned for accountancy purposes into 11 piastres miri, which do not exist as actual currency, the base metal coinage consisting of nickel piastres which are theoretically worth 22 to the riyal or 220 to the £ sterling, but are always somewhat depreciated in the market. The currency thus consists of gold pounds, silver riyais and fractions thereof and the nickel piastre and its fractions, one of which, the quarter-piastre, is known as halala. I should explain that the use of this currency is general in the Hejaz proper and that the circulation of Maria Theresa dollars is negligible, although they remain, I understand, the principal currency elsewhere in Ibn Saud’s dominions, including Asir. 3. Some weeks ago the riyal broke away from the sovereign and went down to 13 or even lower in a panicky market, halalas following suit. The Govern ment, who at times are large holders of gold, appeared to be running short of it. The local market was depressed owing to general conditions and the prospect of a much diminished pilgrimage. Customs dues were raised considerably on staple articles, as reported in my despatch No. O.T. 9 of the 8th March to the Department of Overseas Trade. 4. All these causes doubtless contributed to the slump in riyais, although I have not sufficient expert knowledge to judge of the effect of particular factors nor do I know what quantity of riyais is required for the normal business of the country. The Government were forced to take the situation in hand, and an attempt was made to restore the riyal by a proclamation, which in Jedda was disseminated late one evening by that picturesque survival, the town crier. The Government action produced its effect, but it was said that the riyal still passed surreptitiously at a depreciated price. When the King came to Jedda on the 25th February, conferences were held between the authorities, bankers and merchants. It was decided to enforce the law stringently and to bolster up the riyal by prohibiting the exportation of gold. The Government expressed readiness themselves to accept riyais for all purposes at 10 to the £ sterling, and enjoined this on everyone else. They secured the support of the Nederlandische Handel Maatschappi] (Netherlands Trading Society), which undertook to take riyais at the official rate, plus a small supplement in payment for drafts. The only other banking firm in Jedda, Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), took up a more conservative attitude and declined to commit themselves, although they are in fact dealing at the official rate up to a limit. 5. I enclose a translation of a communique issued in the t( Umm-al-Qura ’ ’ of the 6th March.Q The same number of the paper had a leading article attributing the crisis to the fraudulent manoeuvres of speculators, denying that there has been any real crisis at all and describing the action of the Government. 6. The measures taken have produced stability for the time being, the riyal being pegged at 10 to export-prohibited gold. The effect has been not to rehabilitate the riyal so much as to bring gold down to its level. In view of the poor pilgrimage prospects, it is difficult to see what the outcome will be in a (*) Not printed. [88 X—1]2 country with no export trade and little capacity in the highest places for anv form of earning other than that of postponing, where possible, the payment of debts. It is to be supposed that the level of prices will rise. The action of the Dutch Bank has been of material assistance to the Government, but it is not clear on what basis that action rests. When he embarked on it, the manager Mr. Jacobs, appeared to be confident and to think that the Hejaz was good for anv amount up to the total value of rivals in circulation. He professed to rely on the honour of the Government and thus found common ground with Mr. Philby who in one conversation suggested that anyone who did not share this simple faith might as well give up trying to do business here. 7. Mr. Jacobs seems to be a pretty astute financier and had no doubt some more solid basis to work on. On the face of it his bank make six halalas per £ or about l^d. at par on every draft they sell, and they also charge a commission of 1 per cent. As they are in effect lending gold or its equivalent abroad on the security of riyals, the value to thei^ of these two profits would appear to depend not only on the eventual solvency of the Government, but on the length of time for which they have to carry any riyals not required for current business They doubtless have some redemption arrangement, but I have been unable to ascertain its exact nature. It is within my knowledge that on the 3rd March the Minister of Finance produced a certain quantity of gold for this purpose My latest information at the time of writing is that Mr. Jacobs is not as well satisfied as he was three weeks ago. He told a member of my staff on the 22nd March that he would get out of the arrangement if he could. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith an appreciation of conditions In the Hejas by Hajl Abdul Majid, the Malay Pilgrinage Officer attached to this Legation. Yhia paper, written by an educated Moslem, who is a senior member of the JP lay civil service and whose work here and during occasional visits to Meeea, gives hiit special opportunities of observing the reactions in the Hejaz of a conquering but somewhat decadent Wahhabism, has considerable value. 2. I agree generally with Haji Abdul Majid's views, although I doubt personally whether Ibn Sa'ud has yet reached luc point at which he would for a monetary consideration encourage any scheme for rebuilding shrines already destroyed. There is no doubt, however, that growing financial stringency, with its hampering effect on the King's convenience and ambitions is a cardinal feature of the situation. 3. X have dealt separately with two matters to which reference is made in passing in the Enclosed paper, namely the significance of the recent revival of Hejdl dancing and the difficulties with which the Government hav* had to cope during the past few weeks owing to the exchange crisis. 4.

The Mehmal incident in the same year, however, thanks to the stubbornness of the Egyptian Government over a principle which they deemed It prudent to insist upon, ended happily for the ^ing without giving grounds to his fanatic followers to suspect of his motives other than that, according to his avowed intention, of '‘wiping out superstitious beliefs and practices in the Hejas”. Nevertheless, modern means of communication, such as the automobile, the telephone and the radiograph, appealed to him as military measures for strengthening his position, and these he soon introduced to the country without taking into consideration the fact that his own people wae so backward and far from ready to make use of, much less to appreciate, them. The revolt of almost all his staunch supporters, namely, Faisal ad-Dawish, Mimbajad, Xbn Fadhil and Bin Thanian, signifies not only the unfdlfilment of secret treaties or personal understanding between them, but also a divergence of policy to be pursued in future by the King. Hitherto, he planned all his movements and hishie campaigns ^ith his supporters far the spread of vuhaMieia, hut now he discusses offensive and defensive measures with hi. councillors for the safety and expansion of hi. Empire. ?hat the latter policy is becoming more an * more expensive to be effective in the way satisfactory to him i evident from the fact that pilgrim-taxation (which, by the way, 1. in the Hejaz by far the main source of revenue) has to ^e increased year by year, so much bo that the Muslim world already begins to wonder where such increases will stop. Perhaps the weakest point in hi. Government that is severely criticised behind the scenes by those who are directly affected 1. that no provision whatsoever seems to have been made for rainy day. t, r so that during a lesn season such as is being experienced now the wealthy inhabitants are called upon to replenish hie Kxchequer by loans which are as uncertain of being repaid as the East la always uncertain of the morrow. It is said that the old &lt; aimmaqam (Governor) of Jedda, Hajl Abdullah Hldha, left the country ostensibly to recruit his health, but In reality to avoid repeated demands from the King for monetary loans. So absorbed is Ibn 3a’ud now in his empire-building schemes that the hitherto very stringent laws about smoking in the streets of Mecca and other similar fanatic measures have been relaxed, and so engrossed la he in securing money almost by fair means or foul in order to advance those schemes that it is said if some wealthy Muslim submit it to him that if he is allowed to re-build those places of reverence that the Wahabi, destroyed in the holy citiesr\ Ti e? of Mecca and Medina in 1924 - 1925, he will pay the King a handsome sum of money, I bn Sa’ud will have to thinM twice before he rejects such a proposition* In any event, the change in the policy of the King is noticeable even to the man in the street who, groaning under the effects of the prevailing trade depression, grumbles at the extra burden put upon him by increased taxes. Reports of careless management of the King’s Motor Transport Department, said to be the highest item in the expenditure of the Government, only help to add further dissatisfaction in the public mind. Government officials, ejeoept the few who are immediately about the person of the ^ing, begin to lose faith when their salaries besides being several months overdue are reduced. Wild rumours are circulated in hushed whispers that the overthrow of Ibn Ba’ud is near at hand, and wild conjectures are made, such as illiterate Arabs only can make, as to who is the probable conqueror of the country and successor of the King. The recent drop in the market value of the Hejazian Government cun ency, though promptly suppressed with drastic measures, cannot but serve as the best index for the public faith in the instability of the Sa’udi regime. On the other hand, the King being confident of his security from the impunity of his fanatic subjects in Nejd, after defeating their rebellious leaders, spends his time more in the Hejaz than has been his wonf, and this with his own personal display of a Bedouin war-dance to the public in Mecca during the ’Id days of 1349 A.H. (February 1931) is perhaps calculated to inspire confidence andF}‘ . it J. * 4 I 2489 i r\ and faith in him as a promoter of democracy, the essence of Islam, among the more important of his Hejazl&amp;n subjects the Meccans* Time alone will show whether he can conquer the hearts of iecca, believed to be the hardest of Arab hearts even from the days of the Prophet, as easily as he did conquer the City seven years ago. His two eldest sons, however, (more particularly in the case of Emir Faisal than in that of his elder brother Kmir Sa*ud) have already earned the reputation of being the friends of the immoral section of Mecca; and clean-minded or level-heeded men wonder, unless they change their conduct, if they can be strong enough to rule the country between them and keep the turbulent spirit of the Meccans as well as that of the untutored Bedouins in subjugation, when the time comes for them to take over the reins of Government# It would not be quite unjust, under the circumstances, to conclude that Tbn Ba*ud is now no more a Wahabi, in the sense of being a Muslim puritan, than the average follower of the Prophet in any of the four orthodox sects, Wahabiiam being to him, as it was to his ancestor who first espoused the Cause, a means whereby to achieve an end. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that Ibn Sa’ud by his conquest of the Hejas was greatly f responsible for bringing the Movement into the limelight of the Muslim world, and for its ultimate acceptance Wahabiism muat depend on the merits of its own doctrines# And the Hejaz, or rather ecca, its principal holy city, though it can never be moved into fanaticism as was Nejd, willmMMum will always regain as the principal seat of Wahabi education and influence ao long as Ibn Sa’ud or hia line of descendants is on the .Throne, and this, if for no otner reason, but to save hie reputation as the Wahabi King.

I f'/ Section 1. - *' ' No. 1 ^ O o D Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received March 30 V ; l^ (No. 80.) ’ S lr &gt; Jedda, March 6, 1931. IN my despatch No. 13 of the 11th January, 1931, I mentioned that the Al festivities at Wadi latma on the 9th January in honour of Ibn Saud’s accession included a Nejdi war dance. I did not at the time attach any particular importance to this. It now comes into the same setting as certain more recent manifestations which throw a curious sidelight on the internal situation in this country. 2. The King returned to Mecca for Ramadhan and spent the ensuing festival there. Mecca and Jedda were presently all agog on hearing that the King and princes of the Royal house had danced in public during the feast. Shortly after, as you know, Ibn Saud came to Jedda. He arrived on the 25th February, the principal object of his visit being to gratify the cherished ambition of Mr. Charles R. Crane, a former American Minister and sympathiser with Syrian revolutionaries, to make his acquaintance. This had been engineered partly by Mr. Antonius and perhaps to some extent by Mr. Philby. It was hoped by some that Mr. Crane might produce a substantial gift or loan. Anyhow, the King was all out to do honour to his guest. 3. Various functions were arranged for the King’s stay in Jedda. The Diplomatic Corps were invited to several, as was Mr. Crane/ We all dined at the municipality on the King’s invitation. We all drank tea with Mr. Philby, whose house His Majesty honoured. But the close of the proceedings was a review on the 27th February held mainly, it would appear, to provide local colour for Mr. Crane’s edification. There was a small march past of the infantry of the ‘ regular army.” It was followed by a much larger parade of men-at-arms from Nejd who had come back with the King. This was carried out with some show of military order, but it was followed by a dance similar to that given at Wadi Fatma, though on a much larger scale. Many of the Royal princes took part in it. The leader was the King’s son, the Emir Feisal, so that the Diplomatic Body enjoyed the unusual spectacle of seeing the Minister for Foreign Affairs execute a public dance in front of them. He was most graceful, and he twirls a sword very prettily. He wore an agreeable smile, though it became a little set as the afternoon wore on—it is said that he collapsed at the end of the similar dance in Mecca. Altogether he showed to infinitely greater advantage than when he is conducting the foreign business of his country . 4. All the participants in the dance were Nejdis. The infantrymen of the regular army, most of whom came from that country, intimated a wish to join in after they had gone through their new-fangled European tricks. The King graciously accorded permission. Next day it was announced that the people of Jedda had expressed a desire to show what they could do in the way of a display. The King left Mr. Philby’s party on the 28th February somewhat early because he had promised to return to the palace for this Jeddawi performance. I understand that it was on the same lines as the Nejdi display, although less formal. After that the habit of making processions to the palace with drums, singing and dancing appeared to grow on the people of Jedda and there were two or three demonstrations of the kind during the remainder of the King’s stay, including one on the 3rd March, when the lead was said to have been taken by the Hadramis, and several gay parties running to many hundred people in all surged past my house on their way back from the palace. 5. On the 2nd March Mr. Philby gave me his version of the dancing at Mecca. It began more or less by accident, he said. On the first day of the festival a crowd of Meccans made a popular demonstration before the palace there. It was doubtful how the King would take it—a question whether he would say, as it were : “Oil with their heads! ” or “On with the dance! ” The King was in a good humour and received the demonstration graciously. [121 gg—1] .////■(?/.Then his Nejdis said : “ Let us have our national dancing too,” and th ir assented. When he saw it he was so carried away that he himself in' 6 H ^ It was a brave sight, said Mr. Philby, to see how the others clustered round the King was the centre of a thousand men or so, each with his sword in th • Sword-play, the firing of guns and pistols and the beating of drums are of all these dances. ‘ c leatu’a^ 6. The Mecca ” Umm-al-Qura ” of the 27th February records performance at Mecca in an article headed : “ The Speech of the Sword” r makes no mention of anything having happened on the first day of the fesf i but says that on the second the King held a review of his Bedouin troon • which the princes joined; and that the King threw off his cloak drew his sw ^ and played with it too, “ remembering the old days of his fights ” The w f describes this sword-play as a voiceless speech, because every chance and of the King meant many things. ' n ‘ » es ture t aa' a 11 !® ''’.r 3elf m f ntioned in W h . ear , in g at one oi the functions in Jedda that the ,\ejdi war-dance was a revival, the custom having been abeyance for over fifteen years. Mr. Philby's version of the Mecca demonstration ignores the fact that there had been an organised dance at Wadi Fatmn nS the 9th January, but he too says that these things are the revival of -in ,M practice, and he puts the period of discontinuance at about twenty years' Th brings me to my reason for describing at such length in an official despatch what so far reads merely like a record of the picturesque. p J. bn Saud s , tart , ed fhe organisation of the Akhwan colonief round about 1912. They were clearly designed to provide easily mohilisable fightino- forces fanned by zeal by the present Wahhabi doctrine. The rebels of 1929 turned portion of this instrument against the King.

Colonel Peake's note is a convenient summary of the principal facts in the history of the development of the Wahabi movement, and the rise of the house of Ibn Saud. Appendix 5 contains an interesting discussion of the probable effect on Wahabism of the conquest of the Ilejaz and the establishment in Llecca of Ibn Saud. Appendix 6 and the addition to the note deal with the military organisation which has been set up by the King of the Hejaz. It will be seen that, in Colonel Peake's view, what may be described as His Majesty's standing army is probably not less than 30,000 men, while, 'in time of great danger', he could call in addition on between 40,000 and 50,000 irregular troops. /% Zf - -HB Ooi^muuications on this subject should be addressed to— j g E Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l. if-the following »^r quoted : 591 22/28 D 309 KV&gt; &lt;: Sir, bn.

He could not see that to the Bedwin untouched by the luxury and civilization of Europe such ’ teaching might be acceptable, but to the other Musiiraeen who were treading the road of advancement and education.’the abuses which :\e oned to eradicate were by a necessar^ ? ' part of the system which had overtaken them, since the days 1 when the inspired Prophet preached to the Arabian people. ^he head oi the chief family of Derayeh at this time was Mohamed Ibn Baud of the Mesbalikh section of tne ;/uld All and therefore of the Aneizi stock. Mohamed became the first convert to the restored religion in 1742, about the same time marrying the &lt; h u S , f • °l .Abdel Wahab, from which union soran&gt;y the line o. Wahabi imirs of the He id, see appendix (1). ,,, , , . ^om the commencement the chief onponents of Wahabism were the Turks, who, either in ignorance of the true meaning of the reformer, or fearing that the lax and comiortacle wavs in wVn p.ii ■hVip.v •i-n4-.ov»-^r*t3 4-£a^ + 1 - 1 ^ v o « , V i uhcxj. ana uuiaiox enort to suppress the undesired preachers. The Wahabi leaders, on the other hand, probably uo some extent on account of their cruel treatment at the hands pf the Turks, sought to protect themselves by fostering fanaticism, which was soon construed by the ignorant Bedwin into a positive injunction to kill all who did not follow their tenets. Thus today a follower of Ibn 3ahad would not understand, if he were asked, if he was a wahabi; to his way of thinking he is a Muslim, the remainder of the world being divided into Christians, Jews and Infidels etc., of which the Non Wahabi Muslim is an infidel. The Turks were wrong in considering ’Abdel Wahab as the preacher of a new religion; the only difference between the reformer and the Muslims of his*'and these times is that whereas both profess to follow the laws of the Qoran and iraditions, Wahabis rigidly do so while the others neglect to do so. ^Mohamed ’Ali Pasha wishing to understand what the Wahabi sect really was, ordered a Congress of ’Ulama to assemble and examine the doctrines; this Congress after hearing many witnesses and reading a large number of documents unanimously reported that not one single tenet of ’Abdela Ali ’ s plans of soon began to new Emir. conciliati; havo their &lt; tg the Bedwin by grants of money, lx - e ct in slowly driving back the S3 ' Jtterl: ' d8feSt * d « ^ !n th 6 ^ raeantime the great ^a’ud had died and he was succeedeo by Abdullah as 4th Emir. . , ^ uer u;/i defeat or Byssel Toussoun Bev advanced into Qasim and captured Er Has. , , . astonishment Abdullah now retired to Aneizi and opened negotiations, no doubt feeling his pOoi uion insecure owing to .iohamed !

The Wahabi Emir was first sent to un0n to Constantinople where in soite'pf Mohamed All s recommendations to mercy, he 7 /as executed. . , . ‘ ;e J d was now reckoned as an Egyptian province but within four years of the departure of Abdullah revolts broke out and the Garrison of Riadh, the new Capital, was massacred. In 1824 Turki after a successful rebellion drove out the invaders and was proclaimed Emir of Neid, uasa and Oman, he however, paid'tribute to Egypt. In 1834 Turki was assassinated by Meshari and it was at this time that an unimportant man named Abdullah Ibn Rashid from Hail entered the palace and stabbed the murderer thus helping Feisal to seize the throne of his father. As a reward Feisal made Abdullah Bin Rashid Governor of the Shammar and from this date commences the dynasty of Ibn Rashid; appendix IV. Faisal soon neglected to pay tribute to Egypt so a new^ force was despatched from Egypt in 1838 which quickly forced Feisal to surrender and later to be sent to Cairo. After this an Sgv D tian government was set up m Nejd which lasted two years/ when most ide fali 0 ° PS Were recalled and Khal/d Ibn Sa'ud was KhalidKhalid however was not left long in peace being deposed in 1842 by Abdullah Ibn Thenyan Ibn Sa’ud who became Emir of -ejd until Feisal escaped from bis orison in Cairo and returned to bejd to again become Emir of 1843. Feisal's reign which lasted till 1865 was singularly successful. ’Oman was made to pay tribute in 1845, Rasa had a Wahabi Governor and Qasim was conquered, while Jebel Shammar was again made a tributary of Hiadh. Bahrein being defended with English help however did not return to the Wahabi Empire. Feisal during the latter oart of his reign had become blind and his son Abdullah who succeeded him made himself very unpopular being deposed, by his brother Sa'ud in 1871, after some fighting which resulted in Jebel Shammar and Qasim seizing the opportunity of dissensions in Nejd, to declare their independence. Abdullah retired to Meta r ab Ibn Rashid and began to invoke the assistance of the Turks, who jumping at the chance which they had long been seeking appointed Abdullah deputy governor of Nejd and prepared an expedition to maintain order. The expedition annexed Rasa in t 1871 and shortly afterwards set aside Abdullah*and appointed a Mutaserrif as Governor of Nejd, the Emir fleeing to Riadh. The next year 1872 3a*ud returned to Riadh and turned out his brother, and soon after entered into negotiations with the Turks, sent his brother Abdul Rahman to^Bagdad where he was imprisoned till 1874. After being released he returned to Nejd and raising the tribes beseiged Hofuf, which was soonafter relieved by the Turks, the town being given over to pillage. On the death of Sa’ud his brother Abdullah again returned to Riadh where he reigned till 1886 when he was Sized by his two nephews and put in prison. This gave Mohamed Ibn Rashid the desired opportunity of taking Nejd and marching to the rescue of his master. He defeated'and killed the usurper in the battle of Judi in Rasa and carrying Abdullah off to Hail, appointed Abdul Rahman as deputy governor. During the remainder of his reign, Nohamed Ibn Rashid ruled, with the exception of a few easily suppressed revolts, the last of which v/as in 1890. the undisputed chief of P.iadh and I.ejd and on his death in 1897 his son 'it'ab succeeded to his vast dominions. In 1899 or 1900 the first move of the Sa'uds 4 was made and Abdul Rahman marchedputto Qasim while is son Abdul Aziz made a diversion on Riadh. -’he forces of Ibn Rashid and 'Abdul Rahman met at Tarafiyya where the latter was signally defeated; so great was the slaughter that Arabs, sav the' blood of the fallen mixed with the rain and flov/ed in a red stream. After this defeat Abdul Rahman gave up his claim to the Throne in favour of his son the present Ruler Abdul Aziz. AbdulAbdul Aziz immediately set out to gain Riadh and selecting 200 men he marchedbut of Koweit in the Winter of 1900* At a short distance from the Capital choosing 15 men, he enjoined the remainder to wait outside the town and return to Koweit if they had no news of him in the morning. In the dusk this small band entered Riadh and making straight to the house of Ibn Rashid's G-overnor, they knocked upon the door which was opened by a woman. Apparently the (Governor was in the habit of sleeping in the Fort, but 'Abdul Aziz and his followers entered and assembling all the women in one room and enjoining absolute silence, proceeded to watch the adjoining fort all night. At dawn the Fort gates were opened and the Governor with his body guard walked towards the house. The sixteen were waiting' at the door which they flung ooen and rushing upon the surprised Governor quickly ended the struggle A moment later Abdel Aziz Ibn Abdel Rahman Ibn ^eisal Ibn Saoud was proclaimed Ruler of Riadh to the amazement of the thunder struck population. The following years were spent in gradually consolidating his position, hut a rival branch of the family, sons of Sa'ud joined Ibn RasMd and the latter, pretending that he wished to restore the rightful heir to the throne, advanced against Abdel Aziz. A Rattle ensued at Raudhat el Huhana near Tarafiyva. in which Ibn Rashid was defeated and slain, whilst the' Sa'udist pretenders were found hiding among the baggage, which fact carried their branch of theifcmily the name 'A1 ’Araif' meaning lost property recovered. Abdel Aziz did not kill Sa'ud Cl Arafa or anyg members of that branch of his family but in 1910 Sa'ud_ el ’Arafa again rebelled and with the tribe of 'Ajman at his back he was defeated and fled to -ecca. Just before the War Ibn Sa'ud caused the Turkish Garrisons to one.by one surrender and at the end of the year the Province of Hasa saw the last sign of Turkish rule disappear, without a shot being fired. ‘ At the outbreak of the Great War -Ibn Rashid —took the side of the Turks and a British Officer was sent tohjbn Sa'ud to persuade him to avail himself of the opportunity and advance upon his rival. In 1915 the campaign commenced which ended in ihe defeat of Abdel Aziz and &gt;iisWf™rawal from all further activities in the great war. Thus it was that the Allies having failed in the Fast of Arabia turned their faces towards the Cejas and the Sheriffian family. Ibn Sa’ud always hated the Sherif Hussein of Aecca and had deoised him before the War as being a mere Turkish Government Official. When however Hussein entered the War with the Allies and received a large subsidy his jealousy knew no bounds, while the Sherif T s self-made title of King of The Arabs provoked continually the ironical mirth and scorn of the Wahani Emir. HoClfJ K? sooner had the war ended than Abdel Aziz made preparation for an attack on the Hejaz and in the beginning of 1919_having seized Khurma and Turaba which celonged uo Husseir, he was met by the Emir Abdullah near the xau^er pxace, ano in:dieted a signal defeat unon him, the latter losing 4000-5000 men and narrowly eccapinp - in ms night shirt. r -o There is little doubt that Ibn Sa'ud could have u: n eii taken ^e 01 az but he nrsferred to withdraw retaining Qurmh and Turabah, the Eastern gateways of t^e Feiaz in his own hands. 9 . , fh a t his policy of withdrawal hasproved rirht is/ceftain, as at that time had he conquered the Heiaz Britain would have been obliged to assist its ally and DBBover King Hussein had not had time to become thoroughly unpopular with his subjects. “ n . , ^oon after this attack on the Hejaz the Wahabi Emir turned his attention to the Emirate of Hail and having surrounded the town the Emir Mohamed Ibn Talal surrendered in 1921, from which date the whole of Jebel Shammar once again returned to Dynasty of Ibn Saud. The ouolying district of Jof and the Wadi Sirhan which had been reckoned, as part of the dominions of the Ibn Rashid dynasty had during the war been, taken by Nuri Ibn Shalaan, but in 1922 Ibn Sa f ud sent a force and*'occupied the whole of the Wadi Sirhan with the exception of Kaf which was annexed uo Transjordan, this place however was evacuated in 1925 and given to Ibn Sa'ud. T , In 1924 when Ibn Sa'ud again attacked the ejaz the King had become so hated that most of the population welcomed any change, and Mecca fell without a shot being fired; moreover King Hussein bv refusing all offers to make a Treaty with 5reat Britain had forfeited all right to be asisted in any way. Hussein retreated to Jeddah where he abdicated in favour of his son 'Ali and retired first to 'Aquaba and then to Cyprus. ’Ali in the meantime with the he In of some raw recruits^ raised in Palestine, held out in Jeddah till 1925, when he capitulated and retired to Iraq. Medina and all the Hejaz'at once became part of the Wahabi Empire anc^ Ibn Sa'ud shortly afterwards assumed the title of King of the Hejaz. Thus in 1928 we see 'Abdel 'Aziz Ibn 'Abdel Rahman Ibn_ ^eisa.! Ibn Sa'ud, King of the Hejaz, King of Mejd, Jebel Shammar, Qasim and KJi Hasa and Imam of the Muslimeen. Lest I should further try the patience of the reader I will here bring this short narrative to a close nor in this moment inappropriate, as the voice from the minaret has just callee t e first words of the Azan, described by Ribbon as the eternal truth ' There is no Rod but Rod”, summoning the faithful to prayer, and at this sunset announcing to the true Kuslimeen that once again the ' oly Toon of Fasting has ended. ^ (Sgd) F.O.Peake.

APPEiiDIX (III ) &lt;$/ The army of Mohamed 'All Pasha of Egypt contained several intering persons among whom were some European Officers. The most noteworthy and romantic of all was alnative of Edinburgh named Thomas Keith, --e had served iri the 72 Highlanders as gunsmith and being taken prisoner in one of the Egyptian expeditions, became a Moslem and was purchased by a person called Ahmed nickname Ahmed Bonaparte, Treasurer of Mohamed ’Ali. A favourite Sicilian slave of Ahmed Bonaparte, having insulted Keith, now known as Ibrahim, was killed by the latter in a duel. In order to escape the wrath of Ahmed ^ Bonaparte, Ibrahim took refuge with the wife of ^ohamed iAli who befriended him and caused Tousseun Bey her son t' take him to his service. However, Toussoun who was an ill tempered man, ordered Ibrahim to be put to death for some small neglect of duty and several Persons were sent to cerrv out the order. Ibrahim thereupon defended himself with’’his sword for half an hour and finally jumping ou ^ of the window escaped to his former protectress, who soon reconciled him with his master. Later Toussoun seeing the couragous character of his follower promoted gim to the olfice of treasurer. He fought bravely at Medina and iarba and in April 1815 was appointed Governor of Medina* Two months later he was killed when hastening to assist his former master «rr 250 men, who were al kllj ' ed * in this last encounter Keith known as Ibrahim Agha killed four Wahabis with his own ham ana^oaul. ^ Ibn Sa’ud said that Toussoun and his faitn^ul -reasur were the bravest men in the Turkish Amy.

It is however legitimate to make some forecast of the result of this action on the future of Wahabism, We see that in the beginning of the nineteenth century the success of the Turkish troops was for long in the balance, and that the nornad population, having been estranged by the brutality of the invaders, clung to the Sa’ud dynasty; but so soon as Mohamed ’Ali Pasha arrived in the Hedjaz and began the policy of conciliation, then radually the Bedwin began to fall away from the liejdi iLmir. The present day also shows us that many of the great nomad tribes are not really in sympathy^with the religious side of the movement, but aye held in loyalty to the conquerer by fear of his arms, ana in the fanaticism which it is his policy to create. Ibn Sa’ud so completely cut off from all the anomalies which a rigid of Abdel Wahab, must create steppes of Arabia, out when once came face to face witn long as he remained in Riadh. Western influences, could ignore adherence to the doctrines outside the deserts and he arrived in the Hedjaz, he at once came race to race Western culture ana Islamic world problems.

The reason was the impossibility of being able to maintain a disciplined standing army recruited from either Bedwin tribes, accustomed to tribal organisation and centuries of raids and counter raids or from the settled population riddled with the fears of revenge and blood feuds. The certain eventual effect of this dangerous deficiency was early recognised by Ibn 3a’ud; it consequently was his immediate object to overcome this difficulty by means which would be in accord with the genius of his subjects. In order to do this he initiated at Artawiyya a new society to be known as the Akhwan, which was in fact merely a more militant version of Wahabism, but he so designed this society that it might fill the void in his administration, caused by the unavoidable lack of disciplined regular army: In other words he created a Military Organisation, suitable to the Arab spirit, which being unfettered by tribal jealousies, and political feuds, could take the place of a disciplined army • Artawiyya together with Dakhma, Ghatghat, 3ajir and many other places were founded as Military Colonies, or Cantonments for his standing army which in 1919 could muster 30,000 men and as the number of Colonies is yearly increasing, it is probable that the Ihk^an army is now considerably larger. practically homeless Bedwin, who were then settled on the land, in return swearing to fight for their sovereign and devoting every male child born in the Colonies to this service. The Colonies are bound together by ties'of a common faith and owe allegiance to their founder as the Vice gerent of God; they are per^force dissociated from all the tribal practices and politics and are therefore a constant menace to tribes who break the law by raiding one another within his dominions. These colonies were peopled from poor and These Colonies or Cantonments may be said to into three sections: into three sections:(a) Ikhwan, fanatical Wahabi Warriors. (b) Towns folk and villager's, Wahabis by birth (c) Bedwin, professing but not strict in practising Wahabi texi€ts. The degree of trust placed in the three division being in the above order. In former times before the Ikhwan Colonies had been formed, the towns folk and villagers were regarded as the elite among the fighting men of the Wahabi Empire, while the Bedwin were always regarded as an unreliable element; .’Abdel ’Aziz has however started off in a completely fresh direction. ,r, he recent revolt of the Muteir whose Head quarters are at the first of all the Ikhwan Colonies, throws the first shadow of doubt on the wisdom of founding such a military organisation; will the founder be able to keep in check his own children or shall we in the future see a recurrence of the times, when the Praetorian guards ruled Rome, the Janissaries dictated to the Ottoman Sultan or the Mamelukes tyrannized unchecked in Egypt? Time alone can show whether the Military ardour and fanatical bravery of these Ikhwan Colonis f s can be maintained and whether they will continue as a safeguard or become a danger to the State. Ib n Sa’ud has reverted to tne time honoured practice of using the religious beliefs of his subjects to help him forge a weapon with which to push forward his political and dynastic ambitions; finding the social structure of his state unsuitable for his ambitions he has created a new military class, and it is thus, when we hear the panic stricken Bedwin, shouting Ikhwan Ikhwan, they are not thinking of an attack from the tribes or Fellaheen of iiejd, but from the Ikhwan Colonists; that terrible weapon born in the brain of a king among men and forged by the hand of a master of statecraft.1 /r' In rry Brief Outline of the Wahabi Movement: The date of the attack on Hail and surrender of Emir Ibn Telal Ibn Rashid is 1S21 and not 1920, as stated.

H^jrah, the number of men stated against each is but an estimate. The population is roughly divided into three classes e.g. the Motowwa 1 s (Wahabi Missionary Teachers) (2) Merchants, (3) Bedu farmers. The latter are the fighting class, but the whole male population for military purposes is divided in a special way:- (1) Those always ready, with camel and arms, to obey the call to the colours. (2) The Reserves who in peace time look after the herds and are summoned in times of emergency. ( 3 ) Those men who are employed in looking q.'EXqy trade a^d. agriculture anu can onlj be summoned in times of great national danger. The King may call out the first tv/o cxasses but the third class may only be summoned by order of the 'Ulema, this being considered a step which entails tne eneral mobilisation of the whole male population. The largest total which could be assembled at the first call if every Hijar sent its full quota re- would be about 50,000 to 60,000 men, the/serve being about half the number. THF.
