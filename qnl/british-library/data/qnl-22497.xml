We feel, however, that we should not delay much longer in informing the Company officially exactly what amendments His Majesty's Govern ment desire, and it will be a great help, as a first step, if you could see your way to preparing a memorandum setting out in detail the required amendments. An inter-departmental meeting could then be called to discuss this memorandum, and the best method of putting it to the Company. We hope very much you will agree to this procedure. I might add that during a recent interview here Ballantyne explained that the somewhat uncompromising wording employed in the Company * s letter of the 2nd of January was only intended to maintain the principle that the Company cannot be compelled to accept amendments to the mining lease, which must be the subject of negotiation and agreement.

As I think I explained to Mr. James, one of the urgent needs of the Company at the moment, as I understand it, is the testing of one or more of its Wells at Bahrain, and it would therefore be of great convenience to the Company to have the Supplemental Agreement completed at the earliest possible date.

Dear Starling, Many thanks for your letter ©f the 23rd of December Mo»P»D» 21 Part 3, and for the official letter about Bahrain oil which it covered. The alterations in the draft Agreement seemed trif ling, so I sent off an official letter to Ballantyne, of which i enclose a copy. You will note that I have thought it expedient to add a paragraph warning them that there might be modifications in the mining lease. This excited Ballantyne, who came round to see me in a state of panic. He said that the alterations pro posed in the draft Agreement were quite reasonable and would be accepted at once, but with regard to possible alterations in the mining lease, he would not admit that the Company ought to be placed in the position of having various conditions hurled at them which they could be told to take or to leave. I said that, so far as I could see, it would not be practical politics to hold a pistol at their heads, and that the alterations, which we did not think would be of a very serious character, would obviously have to form a matter of agreement between His Majesty's Govern ment and the Company. This appeared to satisfy him and he will write in and say that he understands accordingly. I mentioned to him points (a), (b) and (d) in paragraph 4 of your official letter, but did not mention Ic) and (e), which can be dealt with later on. I told him that there would be correspondence, but I couldn*t be quite sure what form it would take. If they agree to the modifications proposed, as they will do, then I hope to get the thing off by air mail this weekend, telling the Resident in the Persian Gulf that His Majesty's Government have no objec tion to the conclusion of the Supplementary Agreement, subject to/ barling,Esq.to the modifications embodied in the correspondence. That should satisfy them. Yours sincerely, sd/- J.E.W.Flood.OONFIDENTIAL . NOi 165-S. of 1953.

Could you please let me know what is the total number of employees under the Company in Bahrain, with their nationalities. Prima facie I am inclined to think that per haps existing facts do not justify representations on the subject being made to the Company. Oil operations,whether tiais is actually indicated in a Concession or not, progress through three stagest Exploring, Prospecting, Mining. In the fir st stage only a few experts - chiefly geologists - would be employed. In the second drilling is begun and in addition f to expert drillers employment is given to a comparatively few manual workers to carry out tiie actual drilling, for road making, etc. It is not until the third stage - Mining - is reached, that labour is employed in any large numbers, and even when this stage is reached I imagine that a Gompny would be justified in keeping posts demanding special technical or clerical qualifications in their own hands. The Bahrain Petroleum ...-2- Petroleum Company ie at present only at the second stage, and I suppose tne employment they can give to non-Americans is limited. When they reach the Mining stage there should be ecope for employing local labour, whether British (British Indifti} or Bahraini, and quite apart from other considerations, it will be economical for them to do so. Please let me have your views. 3, Reference paragraph 3. Copies will be forwarded from Busliire, 4, Reference paragraph. 4.

I4th March 1933 Dear Colonel Loch. You asked me to give you a note on the conversations 'between the two directors of the Oil Company and the Bahrain Government during their recent visit here. On Sunday 5th March Mr Jansen and Mr Lomhardi, with Major Holmes and Mr Skinner called on Shaikh Hamed at Sakhrir, I was present with Shaikh Hamed. The 'isit was a complimentary one, the conversation was of no real importance and consisted mainly of eulogistic speeches made 'by Shaikh Hamed about Major Holmes. Mr Lomhardi however told Shaikh Hamed that what he had seen of the Bahrain oil f^eld exceeded his expectations very much. Mohammed Yatim and Shaikhs Sulman, Mubarak, Daij and Ahmed were present. Shaikh Hamed suggested that 1 should have a talk with the directors later on and ascertain what they wanted and what the prospects were of producing oil. On the following day I met the directors and Major Holmes end Mr Skinner. I asked them if they could give us any assurance as to when they would start producing. This they were unable to ao, they explained ^t great length that the date depended on various factors among other things on arranging for markets in the iSast. I gathered that Ir Lombardi hc^d already been dealing with this matter in England. Mr Lombardi said that it could not yet be assumed that the Bahrain field was a proved field as two wells so close together though producing oil were not in themselves a commercial proposition. I gathered myself however that they had little doubt about being able to find more oil. They mentioned the further extension of the present licence by # another year and seemed to think that they were entitled to this having proved that they were diligently pushing forward the work and making wells. They discussed at some length the nationality question this matter there was a difference of opinion between the Americans and the Englishmen, Mr Lombardi said that he was surprised that people not appreciate the fact that it was a British Company because it was registered in Canada, I pointed out that as all the men employed were Americans it seemed to the general public to be entirely an American concern. Mr Lombardi spoke of sending out some iinglishmenI did not at the time raention this po^nt but I think there 1s an agreement made at the time that the company changed hands to the efxect thi. a certain proportion of the men employed, or perhaps as many as possible, shall be British subjects or Bahrain subjects, perhaps this po^nt could be verified as I do not seem to ha^e any note of it in my file. Mr Lombard 1, who d^d most of the talking, then spoke about the other 100,000 acres. Ke said that they wished to get onto the Mining Lease at once but they were deterred from do-'ng this without being safeguarded from another company coming In on the additional area, he said that they w 1 'si. 'd to take a mining lease on this additional area and were wining to pay for it and also to make a loan on future royalties to the Government. If there v ere no royalties forthcoming they would lose the money, they were prepared to recover the loan o^er a long period and not until after the State was red e^lng a large sum from royalties In one year, they would also pay a sum of Rs 30,000 per annum on the additional area and Rs 10,000 cash down or getting It, They pointed out the ultimate advantages to the Government if the company was enabled to get onto the ^ning lease as soon as possible and also the d 1 sad^antages to us of ha^ing another oil company competing with them In Bahrain. I sug ested that from another point of Mew it might be thought likely that security would result in slower progress but against this they argued that they were spending ^ery large sums monthly w^ th so far no return for them. I told them that I myself thought it unlikely that Shaikh Emedwould be Interested in their suggestion. Prom con-ersatlor between Mr Jansen and Mr Lombardi I obtained the impression that the former thought that the latter was not offering enough. They were all nervous^atr ' the thought that some other company might try to step in. The same evening Shaikh ^arned ga^e a dinner party to the directory before dinner Shaikh Haaaed introduced the subject of the A.P.O.c. concessior in Kattar and asked the directors about the terms of the concession, the conversation was,plainly not ~ery acceptable to them. Otherwise no business was mentioned. ~he next day I had a long talk with Shaikh Hamed and Shaikh Abdulla about oil matters. They were very disappointed that the directors were not able to give a definite date for production, they were inclined to consider leasing the ad- Uional area for what they could get, owing to the urgent need for money and they also considered opening tentative negociat-5ons (t at the time mention this po^nt but I think there 1s an e at the time that the co&amp;pany changed hands to the effect thi. portion of the men employed, or perhaps as many as possible, ^sh subjects or Bahrain subjects, perhaps this po^nt could be do not seem to ha^e any note of it in my file, rdl. who d^d most of the talking, then spoke about the other .

When the 10,000 under the prospecting licence became due they would pay 20,000 insteac of 10,000. They would pay a minimum royalty of 60,000, also a futther 10,000 on the lease being signed and a loan of Rs 5000 monthly to be debited against future royalties and not to oe recovered until the actual royalty exceeds booo per month , but not for longer than three years, tnis advance to oe repaid vy instalments of one quarter each year from tne amount wnich the State recie^es in Royalty exceeding 6o,uwU in one year.

The directors began by telling him they wished to give him an electric installation for Sakhrir, this he accepted, then he introduced the subject of the additional area and pointed out that now that they had found oil it was a much more valuable proposition than before. They told him that they had to report to their board and did not at present propose asking about this area but should they do so they hoped that Major Holmes would acquaint him with their views as usual. After this they said good-bye and left him. My own impression is that they expected to get what they wanted on eas&gt; terms and having found that this was not to be they gave up the project for the time being.I think myself that they would probably gi^e more advantageous terms if it was possible to bargain with them but I do not think that e^en for the additional area they would alter the royalty terms of the concessjon.p'fl I nyself that they would probably gi^e more advantageous terms r 'j®ible to bargain with them but I do not think that e-^en for 1 area they would alter the royalty terms of the concessjon.b i agreement permitUng tiiem to use the ground at uxmrra^. %• i recommend that tiie opportunity should oe taken, when the terms ol tne inin*j Lease are oeing tiiscussedjOf linking witli sterling the rupee^curreacy which the royalty of Rs#3/B/- a ton is to be pain in oraer to protect Bahrain against a lall in the value ol tne rupee. o. ihe aatier say oe ol vital iiaportance to Bahrain: lor if,for example,the ru. : .ee aiioulu oe fixeu in tne^ea* iuture at is*4d it tould at unce involve the neavy loss ui seven pence in sixty-three pence or just over 11 per cent.

Q ■50 im.- 3138 /33 Downing Street, y dear Fowle In his confidential letter (J,0,No,44 llo,446k) of the 1st of July 932, Biacoe wrote to me regarding Condition G of the Schedule to he Assent given by the Shaikh of Bahrain to the assignment to the ahrain Petrole-m Company of the oil concession granted to the ©stern and General Syndicate Limited, and pointed out that, in is opinion. Holmes was not fulfilling the provisions of this ondition. 2. As a result of that letter we took the matter up with lallantyne, and a copy of the letter addressed to him was sent to he Persian Gulf in our official despatch of the 16th of August, .932, /e have had no formal reply to th t letter, but as a •esult of reminders to Ballantyne he called to see me a little rhile ago with Lombardi and Hamilton to discuss the position, and it my request wrote me a semi-oificial letter on the matter, a jopy of which I enclose. 3. You will see that the c ntention of the Company is that lolmes 1ms been in Bahrain at all the material times - that is to say, that he has always been available when the Company required to communicate with the Shaikh and the local authori l ies• At the interview Ballantyne, however, volunteered that, owing to the extended activities of the Company, the time was coming when the presence of Holmes would be needed for longer periods. 4. Before we c onsider the raatter further, I should be grateful if you would let me know whether the Company 1 s contention is correct, or whether there have been times when comnunication with the Company has been impeded owing to Holmes' absence.5, Incidentally, Ballantyne seems to be trying to place tne narrowest possible interpretation upon tiie wording of the Conditioa, iien I saw him he said, in elTect, timt all timt Condition G provided for was that there should be a Chief Local Representative fo the purpose of making any communications from tne Company to the local authorities, whereas, if the Political Agent or the 'local authorities' wanted to get into touch with tne Company and Holmes was absent, this would not be a contra vention of Condition C, as there was no provision for this contingency .1 Our view is that such an interpretation of the Condition is impossible, and I am not at all sure that Balxantjne (who is a reasonable sort of person generally, so far as I know) would really tajce that line seriously and commit himself to it officially. Por tne present, I rmve merely sent an interim acknowledg ment of Ballantyne*s letter.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your c/l46d^tM 7th April 1933 enclosing a letter dated 4th April 1933 'from the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, who applies for an extension of the Prospecting License for one year and who makes an alternative proposal. The whole matter has been carefully considered by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and it has been discussed very fully with Shaikhs Mohomed, Abdullah and Sulman. The opinion which was finally arrived at is expressed in the enclosed letter addressed to you by H. 1. Shaikh Hamad. Briefly this government is not disposed to grant the extension of one year which it considers it has the right to grant or refuse. The fact that last summer, when the Company applied for an extension of two years of which only one year was granted, is taken as a definite indication thatthat this government has the right to grant or to refuse such an application. If however this govern ment is informed by the British Government that accord ing to the meaning of the Concession it is not within this governments power to withold the extension then it will be reluctantly compelled to give way. It is unwilling to grant this extension as it would result in postponing the increased payments (Rs 30,000/- per annum) which become due ?/hen the Company enters the Mining Lease. If however this government is definitely informed by you that its attitude, which is based on its own interpretation of Clause IY, is tenable, it is then prepared to allow the extension on conditions that the Company in return for being given an extension, to which they have no definite right, make a loan to the government from its future Royalties. In the case of the Chief Local Representative T s second proposal; this government is prepared to consider granting a mining lease over the second 100,000 acres if the Company will pay a more adequate amount. In both these matters H. E. Shaikh Hamad is anxious to hear the opinion of the British Government as soon as possible. The financial situation is at present serious and it is likely to become more serious o?/ing to the probable loss of the R. E. trade and it would be a very great relief to H. E. Shaikh Hamad if he could count on an increase in the revenue of the State from payments from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient servant.C's. P.

I should perhaps have explained, when Writing the enclosure as Political Agent, Bahrain, tt*a.t Major Holmes had sent a copy of his letter dated 'the 4th April 1933 informally to the Adviser, .Bahrain Government. I, therefore, judged that the best course was to ask for the views of the Bahrain Government at once, so that no desire to delay matters, or to hide them from the .Ruler of Bahrain, should be imputed to us by the interests involved. By doing this, LaJ or Holmes has violated Gondition 0 of the Schedule to the Supplementary Agreemerit dated the 12th June 1930 concluded 'between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, which lays down that 'All communications which that official may desire on ''behalf of the said Bahrain Petroleum Goarpany Limited w to audress to the shaikh of Bahrain shall he made 'through the British lolitical Agent in Bahrain. 1 * I think ( I write from memory ) that this practice of sending informal copies of letters to the Adviser has beei adopted in the past on one or two occasions, 'but I think that it would be well for the Political Agent, Bahrain, to Hobble Lieut-Ool. T.C.Fowle, G.B.K.loi to draw Major Holmes* attention ( verbally in the first instance ) to Condition G and inform him that it would 'be preferable for him to desist from this practice in future, S. It may 'be of use to you to know that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad is strongly against a further extension of the irospecting Licence. lie will, I believe, also be against giving a wider area to the Bahrain ietroleua Gompany without first getting the Anglo Persian Oil Company to bid against them, but he is desperately in need of money.

Bahrain Government are not disposed to grant without quid pro quo further extension of ?roBT)ectinft Licence for one year as it would result in postponing increased payments of He. 30,000 which hecome due when r Company enters on Kin inp Lease. uvU 2, They regard Concession as giving them right to grant or refuse' such an extension. Interpretation is not however quite free from doubt and Bahrain Government state that if they are informed by His Majesty's Government that according to the meaning of the Concession it is not within their power to with-hold the extension they will be reluctantly compelled to give way. If, however. His Majesty's Government agree that the Bahrain Government's interpretation is correct the:/ are prepared to give extension on condition that ComDany make loan to Bahrain Government to be recovered from future royalties. 3. Bahrain Government consider that additional area has greater value than area originally given as it is now known that ail exists and they think that offer of Company is inadequate. 'hey are uneasy about question of declaration of commercially exploitable quantity and write H on this matter we desire to know the truth as to when the Company will begin to exploit the oil 11 .

Information at my disposal is insufficient to enable me to gauge adequacy of Company's proposals, which I understand are less favourable than those which con versations during Lombardisand Sanson's visit led Bahrain Government to suppose might be madei but following informa tion may be helpful to you:- (a) Bahrain Government and Hhoikh personally are sorely in need of money. (b) They are alive to commercial and strategic advantage of oil field on Island near sea as opposed to, for example, Iraq field. (c) In view of rumours of large sums accruing to Iraq Government and offered for rights elsewhere they are anxious lest they may not get full value for their field. (d) It is understood that Bahrain 'Vtroleum Company propose to markr+ -f-heir oil in the Bnst so will escape ^uez Canal dues. 6.

Beliraln, the M 1^53 My dear Fowle, / V/ith reference to my letter Ko:C/l82 dated tlie 29th May 1933,1 think tlmtit might be well for you to know more exactly what has happened. 1 diBcusaed the raatter of Eajor Ho^lBeB♦ letter of 17th lay 1933 with the Adviser,who then had a number of conferences with His ifixce liency Shaikh Hamad,Shaikhs Kuhaiumad and »^bdullali (his brothers) and Shaikh Salman (his son). As a result they produced a draft reply to my request for His Excellency's views,which was practically the letter which I have now forwurded to you. 2. I went out to Sakhir to see a horse race and so on with His Excellency Shaikh Hamad on the 27th 1933 and he asked me if ho might come and see me the next morning to consult mo in the matter. He came with the Adviser,Shaiidis Muhammad and f Abdullah and Shaikh Salman and brought the draft which I mentioned above. They went into the matter in detail and promised to send the letter as soon as possible. At this interview they only made yc some small alterations in wording on their own initiatiwa. 3. I took the opportunity when Shaikh Kuharomad read out the second paragraph in the letter in which His Excellency Shaikh Hamad says that 'we did not decide to give this Company the additional area,either at Sakhir or at any other place',to emphasise the danger which would (y have arisen had be done so. I explained that the British and2, and American Governments were friendly,tout that their Oil Companies were as if at war: if His Excellency were to promise something; to an .American Oil Companyi provided the British Government agreed,the Company would get its Govern'' mcnt to say to the British Government 'Only you stand between our Company and what the Shaikh has promised them, and for the sake of our friendship please remove any opposition'. It would them he difficult for the British Government to obtain more favourable terms for His jSxceliency. I •ruubed 1 this into uhaikh 'Abdullah at a favourable moment by saying that when,for example,Shaikh Ahmad bin Jabir writes privately to Shaikh Hamad and asks him to be kind to a debtor (this is a well known local easel),it is then very difficult for His Excellency to refuse to be kind to the debtor. Shaikh 'Abdullah picked up the idea at once. 4. aj or Holmes may make use of the agrument that he went to the Sheikh because there was no Political Agent here. That was not the case for arrangements had been made for carrying on my work,and he was definitely pre cluded from approaching the Shaikh under the terms of Article *0* of the Schedule attached to|the Indenture between Shaikh Hamad bin isa A1 Khalifah and the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited dated the 12th June 1930. 6. His Kxcellency shaikh Hamad assured me that he did not agree to any proposals,or make any offerj but he added that at times (as in buying a horse) Major Holmes would say one lakh and he would say two lakhs,or whatever it might be,in the way of discussion of the problem. I think,however,that we may- safely accept the position that the Shaikh did not make or accept any definite proposal.

Sir, / In continuation of my letter Ho,33, dated the ^nd June 1933, I haw the honour to enclose a copy of a letter, Ho.C/18^, dated the 59th May 1933, fro® the Political Agent, Bahrain, The letter covers two main points: Major Holmes* action in the matter of the offer of the Company, and the merits of the offer itself. S. Reference para^rap) s 3 and 4 of Colonel Loch's letter. Major Holmes * conduct in the matt er can he criticised on the following points3 (a) His infringement of Condition *0* of the Schedule attached to t e indenture between ShaiMi Hamad 'bin lea A1 Khalifah and the Kastem and General Syndicate Limited dated the 12th June 1930 in approaching and endeavouring to negotiate direct with His Excellency 'Shaikh Hamad. (b) His statement that the offer contained in his letter of 17th Way to the 'o lit leal Agent came from the ShailsJi (paragraiti 4 of the said letter) which His 'Excellency flatly denies. (c) His statement that the Shaikh agreed to certain proposals (paragraph (l) of the letter). His Excellency denies that he agreed to any proposals at all* (d) His statement with regard to certain particular matters: (l) inclusion of territorial ^ters (paragraph (l) of the letter), and (') the provision that the loan - or advance • mentioned/ Xloaty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Colonial Office, L o n_d o n.-s- inentloned In paragraph S of the lettar should 'be dependent on the world market for oil. His Excellency states that neither (l) nor {??) were aentioned to him at all# Ivan allowing for a certain anount of genuine misunderstanding in the course of conversa tion - especially with an Arab Shaikh, I do not see how t e differences between Ifajor HoliHes* and the ShaiMt*s account of their discussions can he reconciled. Ifajor Holmes * statement (h) is absurd on the face of it. Bhailch Hamad is, if course, quite incapable of drawing up such a complicated document. Major Holmes * object in stating that the offer came from the nhailch is, of course, obvious. He wishes to represent the Shaildi of Bahrain as having made an offer to his Company, and therefore to put His Majesty's Sovem-. ment - if they should object to any features of this offer - in the awkward position of interfering between the 'hailth and what the latter thinks to be for his own benefit and that of his State. 3. Hor are Major Holmes* mis-statements confined to the matter of Bahrain Oil. In the matter of Kuwait Oil he has only recently made a statement which His xce lency Hhaildt -Ahmad bluntly stiguiatised as a lie, (Tide my des patch Ho. 34, dated the 8th June 1933, copy to Government of India under BusMre a rinted letter Ho. 631-3 of same date). 4. Major Holmes 1 unfitness for the post of Chief local Representative of the ahrain Petroleum Company has been the subject of some correspondence of late, chiefly on account of his long absences from Bahrain, and as Colonel Loch points out in paragranh 4 of his letter Major Holmes is again absent. In the present instance Colonel Loch suggests/i BtigPfestB that Major Holraes be called upon for an explanation for his action under (a) - (d) raentioned above. I doubt whether much practical good would result from a request for this explanation. I suggest rather that the Company be infonned (1) that Major Holmes is absent from Bahrain for long periods, and that he is again absent now when a discussion of the Uorapanj's offer may be essential at m moment {%)that he infringed Condltion^C' as explained in (a) above, ^he fact that Colonel Loch was absent in Bahrain at the time (acting for me at lushire) was of course no excuse. The Indian Assistant in the Pblltical office had been left in charge, and, Major Holmes could have approached him, or conversely have sent his proposal to Colonel Loch at Bushire; that in his letter of 17th May to the Political Agent Major Heine# made various statements as to his discussions with the HhaiWi which the latter denies.; (4) that in these circunstances from our point of view, and doubtless also from that of the Company, it is no longer desirable that Fajor Holmes should continue to hold the post of Chief Local Representative and that somebody else must be appointed. Colonel Loch • with whom I had the opportunity of discussing the question - would be quite willing that Mr. Skinner, the Company's lelds Manager at Bahrain,//tw •4- Bahrain, ahould occupy this poet, and fro® what I have ae^n of Mr. Tklnn er I concur in thia sugges tion. g # With regard to the Merits of the of 'er itself. A comparison between the offer and what the BhaiKh and the Bahrain Government would receive if they (as they have the ri^ht to do) forced the Company to take out the Fining Lease as from December 1933, fives the following results. A, Payment s hv CoiBT&gt;any if Mininp Lease is taken out, in ^C^her ^J^JlJS. ns. (1) On grant of Mining Lease, under Article HI 10,000 (a) On each anniversary (Article HI) until Company declares oil in conwercially exploitable quantities, for which, under Article X, they have 5 years 10,000 (3) Thereafter, annually, mininum loyalty (Article IX) 30,000 ®# B^yaaents finder terms of offer. W: , ' - so on (1) On signature of deed. TShaiWi, forthwith 40,000 (2) « » M ^ 41 ^ in SO monthly instalments 60,000 (3) « •• n # » state. * 200,000 (4) On grant of Mining Lease, SO months later, twice the payments shown at A ahove, i.e. On grant of lining Lease .. «. 20,000 Antiually until Company declares oil in commercially eurploitahle quantities .» .. .. .• 20»COO Thereafter, annually, •• .. 60,000 vide paragraph l(d) of Major Holmes' letter. (s)/He, (8) go months after signature deed, xx) b s 1 blv (dependent on condition of world market for oil) a loan to State in SO monthly instalments against future Royalties. .. .. .. .. 300,000 Mia$ 1» Reference B (4). Jlimilar sums are offered for the additional area as for the area as laid down in the present ConcesBion. S. Under the terms of the offer(paragratii 1(d) of Ma^or Holmes' letter) Mining Lease will eomraence SO months after agreement has heen signed. 5. ''he proviso that the loan to the Bahrain Government from the Company will depend on the state of world market for oil, etc.(paragraph 2 of Major Holmes' letter) lessens the attractiveness of the terms of the offer. 6. It will he seen, therefore, that ^ is prohahly considerably more profitable to the private purse, and to the 'reasury of the Bahrain Government, than A, I say 'probably*, since if under A the Company produced a large output of oil, the royalties to the '^aifeh might waJee up more than payments under B. On the other hand, if it suited the Company, owing to difficulties in marketing their oil, to produce as little as possible, it would be very difficult I imagine to force them to produce more, and under the Wining ^ase they could go on producing a minimum of oil and paying the minimum annual rental of Is,10,000/-(vide Article III of the Mining Lease) fora period of 5 years (Article IX of the Mining Lease), 7&gt; The re &amp;bon why the Company are prepared to make offer B is presumably that they foresee great difficulties in marketing their oil. That they a~e influenced by some powerful/powerful motive Is evident frora tlie lucrative nature of the offer. Bone time ago (vide Ma ^or Holmes' letter dated the 4th April 1933, enclosed with my despatch No»S6, dated the 17th April 1933) in return for the two concesBions now asked for they offered the loan only ♦ 8, The two concessions asked for hy the Company from the Bahrain Government in return for their offer are: (l) An extension of the Prospecting period 'by 20 months. f 9) An extension of the Mining Lease area to cover the whole of Bahrain territory. 9« With regard to U). Subject to the opinion of His Majesty's Government I see no particular objection in view of the substantial financial 'benefits contaired in the Company's offer. It may he possihle as suggested hy Colonel £©ch (paragraph 6 of his letter) to get still better terms from them. iO* Concession (®), however, raises various serious and important issues, The pros and eons of conceding the whole territory to the Company were discussed at the Inter departmental conference held at the Colonial Office on the 26th Aoril 1933. One difficulty lies in the fact that the territory of the Bahrain State is not definitely known(vide paragraph 7 o^' Colonel loch's letter^. I will endeavour in conjunction with Colonel Loch to clear this point up. 11. In considering the whole question of the Bahrain 'etroleum/CONFIDENTIAL.

The Company thinks it might avoid such confusion by passing the necessary Resolutions to change 1 the name, such change being, in effect, merely a change in spelling so that the Company's name would be 'Bahrain' instead of as at present 'Bahrein'.

(2) Drilliaf*. Particulars of wells drilled. (a) location of wells (indicated on a map). (b) Bate of coiamencement and completion. (o) J. BUI .HTYSE, ESQ.11th May,1933. Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Ounliffe- Lister to request you to be good enough to furniah hia with your advice upon the following matter. 2. On the 2nd December, 19?.5, the Sheikh of Bahrein granted an oil concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited. On the 12th June, 1930, the Sheikh gave his assent to the transfer by the Kastern and General Syndicate to the Hahrein Petroleum Company of all the rights of the former Company under the aforementioned concession. This transfer took place on the 1st August, 1930. 3. Certain Articles in the original Concession Agreement and the First Schedule thereto and certain Articles of the Agreement of the 12th June,1930,provide for the grant of an exploration licence and subsequently K of a prospecting licence and lay down the conditions under which these licenceaaay be extended. 4. 3y a Supplementary Agreement dated the 28th November, 1931, the Sheikh granted a prospecting licence from the End December, 1930, to the 2nd December, 1932, and by a subsequent Supplementary Agreement dated 13th December,1932, the Sheikh agreed to extend the prospecting licence for a period of one year up to and inoluding the 2nd December,1933. 5. On the 4th /'pril,1933, the Bahrein Petroleum Company applied under Article I? of the original Concession Agreement SOLICITOR. RnlAgreement for a further extsnsion of the prospecting licence up to the 2nd December, 1934. A copjr of the letter from the Company to the British Political Apent at Bahrein is enclosed, and it will be observed that the Oompany have so worded their letter as to imply that they are entitled to this further extension. 6. In forwarding a copy of this letter to the Political Resident in the p ersian Gulf, the Political Af»ent at Bahrein observed that he did not consider that the Oompaiy^ could be held to be entitled to an extension of the prospecting licence, but that the question of any further extension must bentreated on its merits. He has subsequently reported that the Bahrein Government are not disposed to grant a further extension of the prospecting licence for one year without a quid pro quo as itwoulxi result in postponeraent of increasedpayment ^ of Rupees 30,000 which would become due when the Company [3 enter on the mining lease; that they regard the Concession as giving them the right to grant or refuse such an extension; but that the interpretation of Article I? of the Agreement of the 2nd December 1925 is not quite free from doubt, and that if they are informed by His Majesty's If 1 Government that it is not within their power to withhold the extension, they will be reluctantly compelled to assent, but that if His Majesty's Government agree that their interpretation is correct, they would be prepared to promise the extension on certain conditions. 7. At a recent interview at the Colonial Office a representative of the Bahrein ^etroleum Company stated that in his opinion the Company were entitled to a further year 1 s extension; that it was customary in concessions— (11 Concessions of this kind to allow the maximum extension of the prospecting licence (i.e.in this case two years from the 2nd Dec ember ,1932) if it oould be shown that the extension was necessary; that in the present instance he felt that the Company had made out a ole®r case for the necessity; he had himself just made a survey of the whole position in Bahrein and he was satisfied that further test drilling was required before the Company oould decide either the depth or the extent of the area for which they should seek a mining lease. 8. There is no reason to think that Article Till of the second Schedule to the Agreement of the 2nd December 1925 could be invoked. The question at issue therefore depends upon the interpretation of Article I? of that Agreement. 9. Sir Philip Ounliffe-Lister would be glad to have your observations generally on this matter; and in particular I am to request that you will be good enough to advise whether, assuming that the Company can show that a further extension of the prospecting licence for one year is justified, it is open to the Sheikh of Bahrein to refuse such extension or to make conditions upon which the extension would be granted. 10. A set of the relevant papers is enclosed. • I am etc., (Sd) O.G.RJ'illiams.7486 Sir, fjV Treasury 8®licitor 18th May, 1933. _ I have to. acknowledge the receipt of . r, WilliaBie 1 Lf/33) o i '!* iii letter (18135Air/33) of the 11th instent on the question whether the Bahrein Petroleum Company are entitled to demand an extension of their prospecting licence under the Agreement entered into on the 2nd December, 1925 between the oheilch of Bahrein and the Oompany*s predecessors in title, fhe Sastern and General Syndicate i.td. 2 » ^ ® x tension of the prospecting lioenoe for w^iich t ■.is Agreement provides raay be granted either under Article IV of the Agreement or under Article VIII of the second Schedule thereto. It is, as I understand, not alleged by the Company that they have been prevented by causes beyond their control from carrying out the work of st prospecting,and consequently it is not necessary to consider the effect of Article VIII of the second Schedule. 3 question therefore falls to be determined under ■■ Article IV of the Agreement itself,which rovi e® t at 'the •»ro£-)eotinf: licence... .may be 0x1 ended for a further I period of two years on the Company shewing to the satisfac tion e ' the Sheikh,acting on the advice of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,that such extension is justified*. I assume that the condition precedent to an extension prescribed by the proviso to this Article has been mt fulfilled and that no question therefore arises with rer; rd to it« * ^h« Agreement does not expressly provid- that English law is to apply to the solution of any disputes which may arise between the parties to it, but I can, of course. i ■ l&gt;icourse, ©nlj/ advie® on the matter on the assuiaption that the rights ©f the parti## are governed by principles of that law, ©n this basis it is clear that where the rights of one party to a contract are expressly declared in the contract to depend on something being done to the satisfaction of the other or on that person being satisfied a® to a certain state of affairs, the second party is not entitled to act in an arbitrary or capricious manner, or to declar# himself as not satisfied by s set of circumstances which any reasonable man would regard as satisfactory. He must ta ^ into consideratio * all the facts of the esse and form an honest conclusion on the matter; but provided he does so no Court will seek to substitute its own standard of satisfaction for that w-iich the p rties have, by the express terms of their contract,agreed to accept, Cthe present ease, therefore, provided that the Sheikh acting on the advice of the Political Besident, fairly ta es into consideration all the circumstances urged by the Company in support of their application, he is entitled to form his own conclusion whether those circumstances are such as to Justify the extension for which the Company ask, ^ It will appear from what I have s^id thst in my opinion the ultimate answer to the question put in r,V/illir-is* letter is not primarily one of law, and that unless the Oo.-ipany are in the event able to show an unreasonable course of conduct on the part of the Sheikh f ey would have no remedy against the Sheikh if he were to come t© the conclusion that the circumstances did not justify an extension of the prospecting licence, y Subject however, to the reservation that the ultimate decision is for the Sheikh acting on the advice of the PoliticalPolitical Ita.ident, the following oonBiderationn B9em to me to be relerant. The reasons put forwaxi by the Company in support of their application for an extension are, as I gather, to he found in t eir letter of the 4^h April 1933 addressed to the Political Agent, In this letter the Gompany point out that they hc-'VG in coitBsiission po '^rfuX '.n d modern drill in.;?; plant end a,re proposini to a-da, or h.*Te added, ®, second plant of the sarae fharecter, luay further state that the Company is conoiderably shead of the drilling programme prescribed 'by the second Schedule to the Agreement, 1 nay perhaps observe that these ioniiderations appear to ^e to he directed primarily to the eondition precedent to an extension prescribed by Article IV, nfeich 1 hate already aaaumed to h been satisfied; if this be so they can hardly he taken into consideration for the purpose of deciding the further question whether the circumstances Justify an extension of the Licence. S, The Company then observe that the prospecting work already done stresses the necessity for much additional information before the true value,extent snd location of the oil bearing formation can he ascertained,and the/ state that to secure this information an extensive drilling eampaign over a considerable area is necessary and that this work mug?t he done before the Company can be in a position, to develop the concession to the utmost advantage of ail interested. The circusstance, therefore, on which the Company appear to rely in sup-port of t^eir demand for an extension is that they have not so far 'been able to obtain as rauch information as they would desire to have respecting the territory in question before selecting particular weas for the purposes of the mining lease which they are entitled@) -I o 1 entitled to dnaad under Article V. I not, o? oours... acquainted with the territory in question, nor with the liffloultias Wiioh may haye been enoounted by the Coapany in the coarse of their operations, and it lo therefore with some diffidenoe that I exoreee any opinion on this contention, but so far as 1 omn appreciate the natter it does not appear to to be a very coaolusiv® one, I ^ f 1 1 &lt;v effect of granting a further extension of the prospeoting lleence ^uld be to postpone the receipt by the iliikli ot the royalt 3 es for which a raining lease would provide, |id it tie Bheikh should com® to the conclusion that a further po t^onemenl ©f these payments ie not Justified in ©11 the nretira stance8, hearing in mind the time which the Company hare fcready h^d for their preliminary work, I do not think euch e wielusion could be challenged. On the other hand 2 do not think ihat the Sheikh is entitled to den sad any pry .ent from the Company m a condition of granting the extension, or, in purporting to tet under t/ie contract, to ir/roose any condition which would .■kst rntially increase the burdens assunied by the C orapany there'- n ter; in coming to a decision on the matter he can, in my opinion, niy t-''ce into account such considerations as are expressly or y necessary implication envisaged by the terms of the contract I self, fh@re is, of course, nothin, to prevent the p rties from B\inQby mutual consent an entirely new agr^arieat in sttsbstitution I? the sting- one, and in negotiating any new r. ree ent the aeikh would be free to suggest such conditions whether of a biancial character or otherwise as be light think appropriate.

Dear Walton, ; In e0nne&lt;!tl0n with Bahrein oil cono e8 Bion, ve h»TS been going carefully into the question of Major Holmes' residence in Bahrein, in the light of the recent disoussions, and Parkinson has asked me to let you know our vie W s. These are, briefly, that the case against Major Holmes on specific points is not a very strong one, and that on general grounds it would probably be better to let matters rest where they are for the present. As you know, the Company hold that all that is required of them under Condition C is that their local representative should be on the spot when there is any business to be transacted. While it seems clear that this contention is contrary to the wording of Condition C, the fact remains that we can only point to one specific instance of his absence at a material time, namely, his departure for Jedda after submitting the Company's application for an extension of their prospecting licence, and it is not clear, even in this case, that his presence has, in fact, been necessary. It must not, however , be assumed from the above that we have any strong desire to maintain Major Holmes in his capacity of local representative. This is not the case, but we feel that it might be advisable not to bring this question to a head and risk a certain amount of friction, at a time when there are other more important things for discussion with the Company. l| | : ■ i I P II ^alt 0n » Saq., C.B., M.C.

I showed him above letter which I had just received and he asked me to inform you of the contents by telegram. He asked what period was specified,evidently wondering if he was being rushed. He spoke again of enomities of Holmes in misrepresenting him, but is more or less indifferent whose money it is as long as he gets money from some Company. 3. May I enquire views of Bahrain Government on this proposal officially just as has been done in case of proposals of Bahrain Petroleum Company? I can hardly delay doing so without incurring reproach from both sides.. 4. Bahrain Government would hardly be able to give 'sole right' as Holmes proposals are already being considered but communicating this letter would put them in official touch with Anglo-Persian Oil Company and clear the way for bargaining.

My telegram 499 r . I hope to get instructions from His Majesty's Government before C^s arrival.m . On the evening of the 29th June 1933 Mr .A.H.T.Chi sholm (Anglo-Persian Oil Company Representative at Kuwait and also. I understand,Assistant Manager under Mr .Elkington) called on ' ra e,having arrived that morning by the east bound aeroplane. 2. In the course of conversation he mentioned the letter ) addreosed Mr.Sampson to me on the subject of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's desire to negotiate for the remaining portion of the Bahrain territory after the Bahrain Petroleum Company had chosen their 100,000 acres. I gather that Mr.Sampson had probably exceeded his instructions in sending me that letter and this idea was borne out by the contents of the Resident's gsSwaBwtw c telegram of the ii9th june 1953 containing the reply of His J Majesty's Government. Mr. Chi sholm said that the Shaikh had raised the question with Mr.Sampson when the latter had gone to see him. I,however,interrupted that I did not think that the Shaikh had raised it on his own and the question coming up tnp- was probably due to previous conversations wi&amp;a Haji Williamson. St' This appeared to surprise Mr.Chisholm and I have a feeling that he,at any rate, did not know of the extent of the comings and goings which have occurred in the past few weeks. He appeared to think that the Company were not very plea.sed at having been to some extent committed. 3. I asked Mr.Chisholm at one point quite definitely he had come for, that is to say 'Have you come here in regard to Q,ata,r affairs or also in regard to Bahrain affairs'. He told me that he was here purely in connection with the Q,atar business® He is going to ca.ll on the Shaikh I understand and , therefore,it is possible that the other question will be brought up. It will be interesting to see what happens. 4. Towards the end of the conversation which lasted some three—quarters of an hour, I thought it well to mention the question of Yusuf Kanoo and asked Mr.Chisholm whether the Company knew a.bout his history. Mr.Chisholm said that he apparently served them well (I interposed by a.sking whether he meant as a buying and selling Agent or in genera.1 and he said 'in general') but that they appreciated that it was with anyf o eye to liimsell . i said that I had known Yusuf Kanoo for a great many years and that his history was like a fever chart. He was a 'born intriguer,climMng up on some new development until he had to 'be put in his place: in short it was a ntTrn of 'a servant when he reigneth'. 1-7-11933.'h' b HZ $ Telegram:- r . No:- Dated:- 29th June 1933. ^ Received:- 29tii June 1933 (18-00 Hours From:- Resident Bushire. To:- Poli ti cal Bahrain. t ' ' ^ My telegram 501, Reply received from His Majesty's Government as follows. Begins: M (l). Anglo Persian Oil Company can only take interest in Bahrain by permission of or as Agents for 'Iraq Petroleum uompany, Matter has not yet been discussed between these Companies and decision cannot be taken before next Board Meeting 'Iraq Petroleum Company on 2oth July, Anglo Persian Oil Company are not anxious to take any definite action until after that date. Position was explained yesterday by Anglo Persian Oil Company to their local people by telegraph. In these circumstances Political Agent should suspend communication to Bahrain Government of Anglo Persian Oil Company's offer. There is no objection to his communicat ing to Bahrain Government HOLMES letter of 15th June. (2). It would,as you will appreciate,be much more satisfactory from our point of view if remainder Island were to be developed by Anglo Persian Oil Company or 'Iraq Petroleum Company though acceptance American offer may possibly be inevitable if no offer is made by other interests. Unless you see objections LOCH should,therefore, inform EELGRAVE confidentially,he understands Anglo Persian Oil Company are actively interested but cannot reach decision compete for another months that our advice regarding American offer must necessarily to some extent turn on whether or not there is substantial competitor in iield and that in Shaikh's own interest it is most desirable that he should avoid committing himself in any way to HOIMES pending receipt our advice. LOCH would no doubt impress upon BELGRAVE confidential nature of above information as to attitude to Anglo Persian Oil Company.' Ends. Please, take action accordingly.@) I On the SOtH June 1933 I asked the Adviser to the Bahrain I Government (Mr.Belgrave) to come over to see me and I communicated to him the position as instructed in the Resident's ! kj telegram of the 29th June 1933. I emphasised the need for treating the part concerning the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as confidential, 2, kr.Belgrave was anxious to know whether ary reply had been received regarding the interpretation of the Agreement in regard to whether the Bahrain Government were 'bound or not - 4nsion of one year for lihe Prospecting License, I said that the thing was under discussion and that I had not yet had a definite reply and that I understood that the general ttend of opinion was that although they were not (v '.■■■■' ds-i^itely compelled to give the extension, the general practice interpreting such Agreements was that if a Company had fulfilled its obligation^such as in making proper efforts to complete | the prospeqjing,there was a moral obligation on the other parti te give an extension of their prospecting time. I added that in that case there could be no question of demanding a quid pro quo,that it would be naturally open to the parties to come to some arrangement among themselves if they wisb^to. 1-7-1933.Telegram:- R/27.
