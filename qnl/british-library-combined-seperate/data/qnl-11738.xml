The original treaty of 1891 was given a term of twelve years, which was extended at regular intervals afterwards, initially for several years at a time and later on an annual basis. In 1939 a replacement treaty was signed between the two parties.The correspondence primarily concerns the effect on the new treaty of the constitutional changes in India, and relations between Muscat and Pakistan under the terms of the treaty. Most of the correspondence discusses whether newly independent India remains a party to the treaty, and whether the new dominion of Pakistan will be required to accede to the treaty.The principal correspondents are the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; officials of the India Office (later the Commonwealth Relations Office) and the Foreign Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1891)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000020#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000020#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
