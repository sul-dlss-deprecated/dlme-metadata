Thomas practised craniofacial anthropometry and therefore the physical appearance of the Shihuh, notably their skull size/shape, is discussed at length, often in crude, racialised terms.The document contains an appendix (folios 25-32) titled 'Shihuh Dialects' that focuses on the language used by the Shihuh. This is divided into two sections 'The Mountain Dialect' and 'The Dialect of Kumazara' and is interspersed with handwritten words and phrases in Arabic script.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Bertram Sidney Thomas</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Musandam Peninsula </geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geographical exploration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000256#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000256#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
