With reference to the diary entry 394, Saiyids Taimur and Dhiyab returned in the “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” after sending Shaikh Eashid-bin-Uziyiz, with 40 men to Nakhl as a reinforcement. 409. The Bani Harras who constitute the garrison in the fort of Nakhl are said to have objected to this addition on the ground that it would provoke an attack by the rebels who had not till then made an appearance at Nakhl. 410. Jamadar Abdullah-bin-Isa, lately in charge of the fort of Samail, has been stationed in the fort of Barkah with 30 men. 411. It is reported that Shaikh Hamdan-bin-Sulaiman, uncle of Shaikh Hamyar-bin-Nasir-bin-Sulaiman, visited Wadi Samail where people welcomed him out of fear rather than affection or regard. 412. A band of 20, and according to another report 50, men of the Siyabi tribe raided Al-Mogabra near Watiyah and drove off 4 camels belonging to His Highness the Sultan. The keepers and others of His Highness’s men offered no resistance and made a belated report to the troops at Bait-al-Ealaj. 413. It is reported from Samail that an Arab woman, who was accused | of adultery and confessed, was stoned to death by order of the Imam, who is said to have thrown the first stone at her. « * * • • • * Foreign interests .— 415. An elderly Arab, a native of Sur, named Muhammad-bin-Salim- bin-Nagim, met the acting Head Clerk on the 26th September. He said that for 16 years he had been Officiating Kazi in the German East African port of Mikindani and is now on leave. He further said that he came here in the company of Abdur Bahman, younger brother of Abdul Aziz Ar-Buwaihi of the French Consulate, about two months ago. He went on to Sur immediately and Abdur Rahman left the Wadi Ma’awal. This Abdur Rahman is a notorious partisan of the rebels, and it is stated that he has lately persuaded Abdul Aziz to lend the Imam a sum of $ 4,000. Abdul Rahman is supposed to be returning to Zanzibar, where he is employed, shortly and the object of Muhammad-bin-Salim’s visit to Maskat was to get into communi cation with Abdur Rahman and arrange for their return to Africa. 416. Muhammad-bin-Salim was inquisitive, asked what was the British attitude towards the Maskat State and whether His Highness the Sultan, in his relations with the British Government, occupies the same position as the Rao of Cutch or enjoys greater freedom. He also wanted to know whether the British Government take action against the rebels or leave matters as they are at present. The Acting Head Clerk replied that clerks knew nothing of these matters. Muhammad-bin-Salim had intended to travel in India but, on account of ill-health, has decided to return to Africa as soon as possible.t) 216 . Tel&lt; 'ram, No. ]r.

When I arrived Mnskat on 6th instant, just after Sultan’s death, position was that rebel leaders had been addressing fetters to Sai' id Taimur and Political Acrent urging former to return to the ways of God and the prophet and assuring the latter that the leaders offered fullest assur ances that British subjects and property would be fully respected and urging Government to remove British troops and leave people of Oman to deal with their own political affairs without interference. Some people expressed view that Paisal’s death might create a detente and give rebels an opening for reconciliation with new ruler. Saiyid Taimur himself expressed this view. He begged that at any rate he he given time to try his luck and meanwhile requested that consideration of the suggestion for the sealing of Maskat and Batineh ports against rebels might he deferred as calculated to clash with his pacific endeavours. During the week since passed letters have been going and coming, the last one received by Taimur from the rebel leaders was in truculent terms and concluded with the statement that they were now about to advance on Maskat to-day. One of the Al bu Saeed family living near Saraail writes to say that the Imam has just left Samail for Zikki and has circularised the Shaikhs of various rebel contingents calling upon them to assemble after the Eed-el-Haj, four weeks hence for the advance on Maskat. Writer adds that they feel that their position is considerably improved by Paisal’s death and weak position of new Ruler. I do not believe they will do more than talk, but I do not think any change can be contemplated iu the garrison of Maskat until Eed has passed after which situation must he considered again. Supposing, as seems likely, that no reconciliation takes } place and question of permanent protection of Maskat has to be considered, I suggest that we should lend a British officer or selected Indian officer or two to raise a small body of levies, say 300 Mekran or other Indian levies, to act as garrison for Maskat in relief of British troops. Cost would have to be made a charge on customs revenue or on subsidies now paid. 217 Telegram P., No. 16 M,, dated (and received) the 14-th October 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. I have discussed question fully here regarding the proposed sealing of Batinah coast and Maskat ports against the passage of supplies for rebels. I find that the opinion held by Major Knox was that the action which would be taken in one or two months with the existing naval resources without incurring any extra expense might suffice to create a panic amongst rebels and induce them to cease their rebellion and possibly to restore to His Highness the fort of Samail: the position would thus be considerably improved. This was the view held on the assumption that Sultan was in full accord with us. The position has by change of rulers been somewhat modified, but I see no reason why project on lines as stated above should not he tried in the hope that it may produce a chastening effect provided that the succession of Taimur is confirmed and he agrees. ^INDIA, FOREIGN SECRETARY'S No. 4 1 M, dated 9 bc/nyis No. 271—1462-IX., dated Rangoon, the 18th September 1918, From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.

'During the week the Sultan has received letters from various friends pointing to the re-assembling of the rebels in the neighbourhood of Samail, but there are no signs up to the present of a forward movement. 3. On the evening of the 29th August, the Political Agent, Maskat, received a telegram from the General Officer Commanding, Bombay, informing him that 372 men of the 102nd Regiment, with eight British officers and nine Native officers and a field ambulance complete, had embarked for Maskat in B. I. S.

As the Colonel of the 102nd is the Senior Officer of Colonel Smith, commanding the 2nd Rajputs, it has been decided to disembark them at Matrah and quarter them with the 2nd Rajputs at Bait al Falaj pending the Senior Military Officer’s decision as to the dispositions he will make.

It is reported that a detachment of the rebels beaded by Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir is attacking Nakhl, which, it is also rumoured, has been taken by the rebels. 394. Saiyids Taimur and Dhiyab are going to Barkah in the “Nur-ul-Bahr ”, with a party of the Bani Umar who arrived from Sohar. The idea is to reinforce the garrison at Barkah and perhaps make an advance on Nakhl. 395. With reference to Diary entry No. 387, Shaikh Rashid bin Uzaiyis / returned from Halban, with the news that most of the Jabiri, Siyabi and Nadabi Shaikhs are now favourable to His Highness the Sultan as they fear an advance, into the interior, of the British troops in Bait-al-Falaj. 396. With reference to Diary entry No. 384, the Wali of Quryat has since reported to His Highness the Sultan that the Bani Battash have dispersed and gone back to their homes. ******* 404.

Sib, H.M.S. “ Odin ’* at Masqat. 6th August 1913. I have the honour to report the progress of affairs in Masqat during the past week. 2. Up till Thursday, the 31st July, nothing of importance transpired and advantage was taken of the lull for H. M. Ships “ Odin *’ and- “ Alert ” to carry out aiming rifle practice and Gunlayers’ Test. The occupation of the Tower in Muttra by landing party from “ Odin’* was discontinued, but “ Alert” burnt her searchlights over the hills at back of the town during the night 3i On Thursday, am., I visited the Political Agent and found him just completing the history of the present rebellion to the 31st July, a copy of which is enclosed. 4. It will be seen that this history ends in a decidedly optimistic tone which will appear to be justified from the letters from Sayid Hamad to his father the Sultan, and the other letters, copies of which are attached to the history. 5. At 9 0 p m , however, that same night (31st July), I received the following signal from Political Agent :— “ I have heard unofficially disquieting news from Bidbid and although immediate risk is unlikely, all reasonable precautions should be taken,” and next morning I received the following report from Political Agent:— “ 1st of August. Sayid Hamad and Mozaffar arrived early this morning with eight Shaikhs of the Bain Tabir from Jaybu Taun Hil. They left their forces in the Wadi Jiylu under Hillal bin Hamad, the Wali of Binka. It is now' reported that their forces have reached Sib. There are rumours current in the town that Bidbid has fallen and that Samail is hard pressed.”—A 6. On the night of 1st August, the Officer Commanding the Troops at Beit al Falaj signalled as follows “ Friendlies coming through picket report Imam’s army now advanc ing One portion has arrived at Musfasa on the road to and a- day’s march from Masqat, and the other portion at Khodh, about four hours from Sib. Musfasa let say they are coming on to attack Masqat. I have strengthened my pickets. Can you if needed spare a machine gun for one I returned to c ‘ Philomel ”, if not, could one of the launches bring one over from Jashk, also barbed wire and uprights”. 7. I directed “ Harold ” by Wireless to bring gun, and . barbed wire as requested, and early next morning went out to Reit al Falaj to confer with C43AD2 the Officer Comraanding Troops and we agreed on the following measures for protection of Masqat and Muttra:— The 2nd Rajputs hold the line of hills to the West of Beit al Palaj with pickets extending from half a mile north of Akabat Wateia to Burj Ruwi. “ Alert” to be anchored West of Darsoit so as to 1 command the plain in front of the Rajput pickets with search lights and guns and also to block the coast road. She is also landing a picket with machine gun nightly in the tower at the north-west corner of Muttra. “ Harold ” is anchoring nightly in Muttra Harbour to support this picket. “ Odin ” remains in Masqat Harbour prepared to land to defend town of Masqat and to this end it was determined to ask permission to occupy the fort of Marani, which commands the approaches to Masqat and also the town in case of internal troubles, and which it was thought would be a good position for a 3 pr. gun if one could be mounted there. 8. On the 3rd of August, about 7-30 a.m., I saw Political Agent, who informed me that His Highness the Sultan had already been to see him that morning with the news that Sayid Nadir had arranged to be allowed to evacuate the fort at Samail and was now on his way to the coast at Sib Pohtical Agent also informed me that His Highness had mentioned the advis^ ability of our occupying Marani Fort, and he arranged with me to visit the fort that evening with His Highness to decide on the matter.

Report on the history of the rising 0 } the Imam of Tan uf brought forward to the 31st July 1913. The present lull in active operations seems to afford a good opportunity for presenting a history to date of the Imam’s rising and for taking stock of the present situation of affairs. Causes of rising. 2. It now transpires that, practically ever since the establishment of the Warehouse in September 1912, the principal Abbathi Sheikh, Abdullah bin Hammad as Salimi, has been quietly at work, sowing disaffection among the Omani tribesmen. His method has been to misrepresent the Warehouse as a subtle device of the English, who had bought over the Sultan to their purposes for depriving the Omani tribes of modern weapons, and especially of ammuni tion so that they might reduce them to impotence and then ride rough shod over them. 3. It has also been suggested that a more recent cause, which may be compared to the match that set alight the combustible material carefully pre pared by as Salimi, was the converting to his own uses by Syud Faisal of a portion, estimated at dollars 18,000 of the estate left by the lately deceased Kazi of Sohar, Muhammad bin Saif ar Rahaili. The late Kazi was, for this country, wealthy and respected and he died leaving a son his sole heir. Svud Faisal’s action, though high handed, was not, in the customs of the country, unusual but, probably on account of his personal unpopularity which seems unquestionable, gave great umbrage to the “ Mutawwah ” or religious party, who seem to have considered, though it is uncertain on what grounds, that the* money should have been devoted to the support of the poorer brethern amono* them. The immoveable property is nominally in charge of the son. History of rising. -1. The; first results of these machinations were the alarmist reports that reached Masqat in the third week of May 1913 that Sheikh Abdullah as Salimi had set up his son-in-law, Salim bin Rashid as “ Imam of the Muslimin It was alleged subsequently that Salim bin Rashid, styled al Kharusi, had to be appointed to this honourable position with threats of being shot if he did not accept the post, ibis Imam malgre lui had commenced sending letters full of ln U H,e« o 0t fir S fl i 0m th u ?° ran ’ t0 u the P rinci P al Sheikhs of the country side, n these letters he called upon them to rise in defence of the Truth and to *-“■« “»«&gt;■« ^ “ Nizwah and Tustaq were reported threatened.

The V ah of Nizwah had held his post for about sixteen years. He came into his position by treacher ously assassinating, somewhere about the year 1899, one Hillal bin Za nr, a local Sheikh of the Bani Hina, who then held Nizwah fort on his own account, setting at nought the authority of the Sultan. This Hillal had originally been established there by Syud Turki, father of the present Sultan jand he he.dte fort for some 12 or 14 years. Saif bin Hammad bin Saif bin Amir, the Wall who committed suicide, was a member of the ruling family, A1 Bu Sa id, and his father before him had held Nizwah fort, until he was turned out by the local Sheikh, Hilla bin Hammad of the Bani Hina, already alluded to Hand bin Hammad, the brother of the Wali, has been imprisoned by the Imam at Nizwah. Fall of Izki and Awaibi. 6. On the night of the 4th June, His Highness, now thoroughly awake to the dangers that threatened him, took active steps to reassert his authority and seized some sympathisers of the Imam who had come from Zanzibar, had bought arms from the Trench merchants at Masqat and were escaping to the Batineh coast. His Highness confiscated both their money and their arms to the value, it is said, of one lakh of dollars. Syuds Nadir and Hammad, second and fourth sons of His Highness, were despatched respectively to Samail and Nakkal, the one to assist Izki twenty miles from Nizwah, and the other Awabi, an outpost of Jtustaq. Both \rere seriously handicapped by the treachery and supineness of the Ghafin tribes, supposed to he loyal to His Highness the Sultan. Not the least serious effort was made to relieve Awaibi, which was, after a short resistance, surrendered y His Highness’ Hadhrami ’akid : the news of its surrender reached Masqat on the 24th of June. With regard to Izki, the position was little better; the family of al Khalili, of the Bani Buwaha, Abdullah bin Sa’id al Khalili and his son Ah, endeavoured to persuade Syud Nadir to proceed to Izki and to take with him from Fort Samail the gun presented by the French Government to the Sultan of Masqat. Syud Nadir was ordered by his father to do nothing of the kind and the Wali of Sur, Svud Hamud bin Hammad, was sent up with All bin Abdullah al Khalili to assist his younger brother, Syud Saud bm Hammad, Wali of Izki. Syud Hamud reached Izki without opposition but Ah bm Ao* dullah al Kbalili persuaded him to withdraw again to Samail and, iu the mean time, let in the Imam’s forces, when Syud Hamud could no longer return to the assistance of Syud Sa’ud who, finding himself outnumbered and deserted by his troops, surrendered the fort. Syud Sa’ud bin Hammad is now prisoner in the hands of the Imam. The news of the fall of Izki reached Masqat on the 20th of June. List of principal rebels. 7. It appears that the fall of Izki was the signal for Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harathi, the most active and enterprising of the Hinawiyah Sheikhs, whose name is already familiar from previous Omani risings, openly to espouse the cause of the Imam, when he joined at Izki. Up till then, he had been sitting on the fence. Hitherto, the Imam’s chief supporter from the tribes had been Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir an Nabhani, of Tanuf villasre, the Tamimah ot the Bani Riyam {vide P. G. Gazetteer, page 1594) and the four principal rebels from now onwards may he reckoned to be : Salim bin Bashid al Kharusi, the Imam. Abdullah bin Hammad as Salimi, his principal spiritual adviser. Isa bin Saleh al Harathi of the Hinawiyah. Hamyar bin Nasir an Habhani of the Ghafiri, Position on the 26th June. Thus, on the 26th of June, the position was as follows :— Nizwah, Izki and Awaibi were in the hands of the rebels. Syud Nadir was in Samail; Syud Hamaud in Nakhal; and Syud Timur, the heir apparent, witha nartv of the Ja’alan men, the Bani-bu-Ali from Sur, was steaming up to Sib with the intention of proceeding to Bidbid, n\ miles ‘“ h “ d i r0 “ ^, miles from Samail fort. His Highness was much elated at the arrival of the Bmi-hu-Ali in whom he put great confidence, lie was certain that w ith their Wah the^ising would fall to pieces and the Ghafiri Sheikhs return to their allegiance. The Bani-hu-Ali w ere under the command of Muhammad bin Hash, a nephew of the late Amir of Ja alam, Abdullah &gt;in Salim a Alawl, who died early in this year. On the 30th of June, Syud Timur returned and reported that the Bani-bu-Ali had established themselves at Bidbid and Syud Hammad bad gone thtretoo. Prospects of an early quelling oi the rising were in sight and it was ho|&gt;ed that Syud Kadir would be relieved at no distant date. 9. On the 2nd July, Major Murphy of the Intelligence Department arrived from Bushire to study the situation with a view to making arrangements, should the necessity arise, of landing troops for the defence of Masqat and Muttra. He was introduced to His Highness the Sultan, who placed the Naib Maliof Muttra at Major Murphy’s disposal and every assistance possible was given to that officer by the local authorities. Retreat of Sultans forces and arrival of British troops. 10. On the 6th of July* the hopes of paragraph 8 were rudely dispelled by &lt;1) the fact of the Shihuh forces assembled at Nakhal for the relief of A waibi falling back on Stehar and (2) by the unexpected and unaccountable retreat of the Bani-bu-Ali from Bidbid to Wataiya, an outlying hamlet of Muttra. His Highness had them brought into Masqat for the defence of the town and there by greatly added to the alarm and anxiety of the inhabitants, as the Bani-bu- Ali bear an evil reputation for looting and general misbehaviour. It must he added in their favour, that during their stay, no looting of any importance took place hut their counsels were divided, they quarrelled bitterly among themselves, they paid little attention to the authority of their nominal leader, Muhammad bin Nasir, and it was only with great difficulty that they could be persuaded to obey orders of any kind. At the same time, news came that the Imam had reached Samail, Syud Nadir was completely surrounded and that Isa bin Saleh was attacking Bidbid. His Highness appealed to the Political A^ent for assistance and he' also wrote officially in the same sense to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf {oiue enclosure to Masqat endorsement No. 101, dated 7th July 1913). By good fortune, His Majesty’s ships “ Philomel ” and “ Odin ” were in Masqat harbour, the “Pelorus ” was on her way and the three ships received orders from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to stand fast till the situation cleared. . Tbe Political Agent despatched a telegram, No. 98, dated 6th Julv 1913, asking that the 2nd Rajputs from Bushire might be despatched to defend the two towns of Masqat and Muttra. 11. On the 9th of July, His Highness addressed the Political Agent in writing [vide accompaniment to Masqat endorsement No. 103, dated 9th July 1913) and asking that the Rajputs, who were expected that evening by the fast mail, should be landed for the defence of Masqat and Muttra. On their arrival that evening, they were duly landed at Muttra for the night. His Highness visited Colonel Smith, the officer commanding the troops, the next morning in company with the Political Agent, and the Rajputs left the same day and on Ruwi ^ ia a:1 a hamlet soutl '- w C8t of Muttra; a picquet was posted * a b Communication of the Political Agent to rebel Chieftains. A 2 * ° a of tbe Political Agent wrote to the four rebel rVeatin^tofem^he^- P h 7 &gt; reminding them of, and of re mnorta^merernf n S '? that fhe Br ‘ tish Government, in view important interests of British subjects m the two towns of Masqat and7 Muttra, would not tolerate an attack by the Chiefs of Oman on these two places. The letters were delivered by a messenger, kindly supplied by His Highness, to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harathi at Bidbid. The Sheikh took the /-v letters and returned the messenger without an answer. A reply was, however, eventually received, on the 21st of July, through the post from the Imam Salim bin Rashid ai Kharusi. This reply was dated the 14th July and the method of its delivery proves what was indeed fully suspected before that the Imam has many friends and sympathisers in Masqat itself; it is polite, says that the Sultan has long been deposed by the ’Ulamah but has refused to abdicate; it warns the Political Agent to desist from troubling, or interfering in, the affairs of the Muslimin. It forms the enclosure to Masqat letter No. 118, dated 21st July 1913 to the address of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 13. The Political Agent, iu obedience to directions from the Political Resident, on the 10th of July, took his French Colleague into his Confidence, informed him of the landing of British troops for the defence of Masqat and Muttra at His Highness’ request. The intimation was well received and no hint was offered of any objection to our action. 14. On the 13th July, the suggestion was put forward by the Political Agent and supported by the Political Resident that two battalions of Native Infantry of field service strength with two sections of a mountain battery should be despatched to Sib, ready to advance on Samail if required. It was hoped that the landing of a strong British force would take the heart out of the rebels and the way would be opened for the Sultan’s sympathisers to move into the Wadi Samail and quell the rising. In a further telegram, dated the 19th July, the Political Resident pointed out that the possession of Samail and of its two main communications with Muttra were essential for the commercial existence and security of Masqat and that, if Samail fell, its recapture would, though a more difficult task, be a necessity. Events at Sib. 15. On the 15th July, the Sultan himself left for Sib, arranging that he should be preceded there by a force of about 250 men under the command of Mozaffar bin Sulaiman bin Suwailin, Wali of Sehar^ who had arrived at Wataiya a few 7 days previously. On the 19th of July, the Political Agent proceeded in H. M S. “Philomel”, kindly placed at his disposal by the Senior Naval Officer, to Sib where he interviewed His Highness asking him if he required more assistance. He found the Sultan in one of his confident moods and the latter said that he would inform him definitely, in three days’ time, whether he required more help, adding that, if he did not ask in three days’ time, he would not ask at all. His Highness was buoyed up in his hopes by letters received from various tribes round as Safalah, the lower portion of the Wadi Samail, urging him to send them a leader, when they would all rise in his favour. The Sultan asked the Political Agent to return that evening to Masqat, as the signs of open sympathy and friendship that existed between His Highness and the British representative were mis understood and objected to by his troops and the Omanis up country &gt; and militated against the Sultan’s chances of quelling the rising himself. 16. On the 21st of July, the famous mine, of which much had been heard in vernacular letters to His Highness during the preceding weeks, was fired with partial success at the north corner of Samail Fort but Syud Nadir, who had been pluokily holding out all this time and inflicting some loss on the rebles, had made his arrangements to meet this disaster and his position w r as little affected. The rebels at once began another mine under the principal eastern tower, but this was a more difficult undertaking and eventually failed falling in and killing some of the workmen. 17. On the 21st July, in the evening, alarming news in writing was receiv ed from the Sultan and brought by Syud Timur to the effect that an attack on Sib was impending that very night. The Political Agent and the Senior Naval Officer at once proceeded to consult Syud Timur, who was on the steamyacht “ Noor al-Bahar,” anchored in Muttra bay, and it was decided that the Political Agent, with Major Murphy, should at once proceed in H. M. 8. “Alert”, which had arrived that day, to Sib to the Sultan’s support and that the “ Pelorus” and “Philomel” should follow, if the news telegraphed from f Sib suggested such a course. It was decided that, in the event of urgent necessity, a Naval contingent should belauded to assist the Sultan in repelling tbe attack of the rebels and to ensure His Highness’ personal safety. 18. H. M. S. u Alert *’reached Sib at daybreak on the 22nd, and found all quiet there. His Highness had completely recovered his equanimity, was full of schemes for reasserting his authority, had already despatched his son Hammad with Mozalfar’s force on its way to Bidbid and went so far as to assure the Political Agent that, in eight days’ time, Syud Timur would open the gates of Samail Port and relieve his brother Nadir. After the evening interview of the 22nd, Syud Timur, in a short hurried talk with the Political Agent, was certain that His Highness was over confident; he had no hopes of his own troops, still less of the Ghafiri inhabitants of as Safala portion of the Samail valley, on whom, in spite of frequent indications of treachery and dis affection, His Highness continued to rely. 19. A third interview took place on the morning of the 23rd. No satis factory news had been received of Syud Hammad’s advance and Syud Timur had not yet started. At all three interviews the Political Agent went, as far as he could venture, in urging His Highness to treat the British Government more fairly, warning him that, if the present attempt to relieve Samail failed, there would be no time to relieve Syud Nadir or Samail and that its recapture, with the whole country in a blaze of rebellion, would be a very different thing from its relief. He failed, however, to disturb the Sultan’s optimism and returned to Masqat in H. M. S, “ Alert ” the same day. Return of His Highness to Masqat. 24th of July, His Highness returned to Masqit about midday and, before even visiting his Palace, came to see the Political Agent. He brought somewhat reassuring news of the movements of Syud Hammad, who had penetrated as far as Hamin and Parfarah with little opposition from the enemy but Syud Hammad at the same time cited frequent instances of treach ery and it was difficult to build any great hopes on this work in advance, while it was clear that the Sultans hopes of a Ghafiri rising in favour of his sons were not hrintention or returnin™ 01 ’ ' aS StiU ^ Sib ’ Wllether HiS Hi S lmess expressed 21.

(2) That the AVali of Samail, Nakhal and Sur should belong to the Imam exclusively. (3) The reduction of customs duties in all the ports to the rates that w’ere in force in the time of the Imam Azzam. May God pity him. (4) And that the Sultan and his sons should promote good and prohibit evil to the best of their ability. Now, if the Sultan grants those conditions in full, we hope from the Imam that he will desist from fighting. And his brother Nasir-bin-Rashid, wrote it with his own hand.” Visit of R. M. S. “ Alert *’ to Sohar. 23. On the 24th July, at the instance of His Highness the Sultan H.M. S. “ Alert 9t left for Sohar to ascertain the state of affairs there and to reassure British subjects. Commander Wood, R. N., on his return, reported that he had landed wi f h Major Murphy, that British subjects were evidently alarmed by the prospect of the Imam’s coming and greatly reassured by the visit of a man- of-war, that the Arab Naib Wali and the Arab community, though friendly, were evidently much exercised as to what could be the object of the visit and, finally, Commander Wood came to the conclusion that the Arab community of Sohar had little confidence left in the Sultan and would be disposed rather to welcome the advent of the Imam. 24. It was not until the morning of the 27th, when the Political Agent had an interview with His Highness the Sultan that he was enabled to account for the unusual anxiety displayed by His Highness on behalf of British subjects at Sohar. It then transpired that His Highness desired to ascertain whether any news had been received of the arrival, or of the approach, of certain Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, on whom His Highness relied to act as intermediaries between himself and the Imam. The Naib Wali of Sohar had written to His Highness that nothing had been heard of these people at Sohar. The Political Agent again asked the Sultan whether he had made up his mind finally to appeal to us for the suppression of the rising. He informed him confidentially that, although it seemed clear from telegraphic news that the Government of India were carefully considering the possibility of being appealed to for further assistance, it was quite impossible for them to proffer assistance unasked and that it washy no means sure what decision they would arrive at. His Highness asked for five more days to await the arrival of the Chiefs from Abu Dhabi and expressed disappointment at their delay and failure to keep their promises, though it is not easy to see what assistance they can render him. 25. Thus on the 27th of July the outlook for His Highness seemed blank indeed. One would have imagined that it would have been only a question of time for him to find himself at the end of all those false hopes. His pro crastination had apparently extinguished all hopes of a relief of Samail as the time for a rapid dash on the Fort had passed. Its fall within the next fort night was to be anticipated. The result would be to confine the Sultan’s authority, even if only temporarily, to the enclave of Muttra and Masqat, when it would become a question whether British interests would not demand our10 intervention for tbc restoration of order, whether that should he accomplished by— (1) arriving at some understanding with the rebellious tribes, assuming a protectorate over Masqat and Muttra and the environs, together with police rights up the Batineh littoral, leaving our relations with Sur and its hinterland much as at present or; (2) compelling the rebels to submit to their lawful sovereign. 26. But the situation is kaleidoscopic. On the 2Sth July, in quick succes sion to a despairing appeal to Svud Hammad from Syud ftadir, came reassuring news in a letter from Syud Hammad to His Highness; they pointed to the practical withdrawal from Samail Fort of the rebels, the fears of Sheikh Mamyar for his own life, the return to their allegiance of the Bani Jabir and as Siyabiyin and finally to the prospect of an early advance and speedy victory. At the same time, Shiekh Isa bin Saleh wrote to Syud Timur offering to nego tiate with him It is true that, up to the date of writing, 31st July, no news has been received of a realisation of these hopes but neither have they been contradicted nor has Samail fallen and the miraculous restoration of the Sultan’s authority is within the bounds of possibility. The date trade is at a stand still and this must be a matter of as grave concern to the up country rebels as to the British Exporters on the coast and it is probably on this chiefly that we must rely for a return to peaceful conditions. iS'o doubt also, the plans of the rebels have been upset by the prompt landing of the force of Native Infantry which has diminished their hopes of dictating terms to the Sultan in bis own Capital. 27. This report is intended to bring the history of the rising up to date and to try and reconcile the contiadictory rumours that have marked its progress, To attempt at present any forecast of what our future attitude should be with regard to the Sultan and his relations with the tribes of Oman would appear premature.

On the clay of the letter Hamayar wrote to Thani bin Zahran as- Siyabi asking for 30 men for his personal safety in Saf-alah and Shaikh Thani was to go the next day to Samail. Aulad Hilal bin Zahir (1) Zahir and (2) Ali Baui Hina whose father was the hostile W T ali in Nizwah before Saif bin Hamad the late Wali who committed suicide were afraid to remain in Sefalsh and went over to ’Alayah, none but Hamayar remaining there.

There has been very little development during the week ; Sayids Taymir and Naydir arrived at Masqat on the 11th and appear to h ive brought all the men they had at Sib with them, so that Sib is practically abandoned to the Imam, but there is no news that he has occupied it though his forces are known to be at Kodh, which is only about 7 miles from Sib. 3. The Political Agent informed me that he had replied to the Imam’s letter, a copy of which accompanied my last report, to the effect that the Imam had already been informed that the British Government would protect Masqat and Muttra, and any attack on those places would bring him into collision with the British Government.

Maskat Affairs. M—13 Sir, H. M. S. “ Odin ” at Maskat, 26th August 1913. I have the honour to report that so far as Matrah and Maskat are concerned, nothing has happened during the past week. 2. As regards the rebels, they appear to have all dispersed in order to keep the fast of Ramazan at their homes with the exception of a few in garrison at the various towns occupied by them. They appear to have arranged to assemble again at the new moon, and have threatened to come to Maskat then unless the Sultan complies w ith their demands. 3 Salim bin Rashid, who has hitherto been the nominal head of the movement, had already been reported as occupying that position against h:s will, and it also appears that he did not command the full support of his followers on account of his not being of good family ; Isa bin Saleh, one of the principal leaders, appears to have recognised this and to have accordingly employed the respite in visiting the Shaikh of Rustaq, who is a relative of t e Sultan but not loyal, and to have prevailed upon him to become imam. 4. In view of the possibility of an attack early in September, the Officer Commanding Troops has suggested that even should another battalion be sent, the 2nd Raiputs should remain here lor another fortnight or so, but as \et we have no news as to whether it has been decided to send another battalion or not 5. The Political Agent suggested that it might he advisable ‘‘ -F 0 *” to endeavour to get up here sooner, but after consultation we decided that, it necessary, she could be asked for by telegram if developments during the next few days seemed to warrant it.

[1863 y —5]Tele^am P., No. 169, dated (and received) the 19tb September 1918. Prom—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary, Siml t. (Addressed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.) The following is repented to Poreign Department with reference to their telegram No. 353,Elated the 30th August 1913. I have just come hack from tour to Batinah Coast having called at Burk a, Suwaiq, Khabura and SohaT ronle % and I find the whole of the Batinah Coast is tranquil and apparently no dread exists among Batiuah people of an advance on part of rebels. Situation, there- 1 fore, appears to be that so long as our troops safeguard Maskat and Matrah, no attack by rebels seems likely. In the meantime, however, insurrectionists are tightening their grip on tribal territory in the interior nnd are confiscating and 1 offering for sale private land belonging to Sultan and levying. Zakat on date fields of numerous owners who are not in a position to offer resistance to them. Rebels will consequently be in a better position, when our troops are withdrawn, to renew their attempts on Matrah and Maskat. Sultan has but \ two weapons wherewith to fight and restore them to their senses. These weapons are (1) his power to prevent supplies of rice, &amp;c., going inland; (2) the imposition of a heavy punitive duty on dates grown in rebel valleys which find their way to Maskat and Matrah for shipment. In connection with supplies which leave or enter Maskat and Matrah by land, troops are well situated to shut off all such arrivals and departures. As regards the sea borne trade of Matrah and Maskat, Sultan could extend his proclamation of 1898 which would cover food supplies of all descriptions, in fact His Highness could declare a naval blockade J)f the Batinah Coast; notifying all Persian ports by telegraph and informing Arab Shaikhs with least possible delay. In this measure His Highness would have to be support ed by our war ships and launches (vide my telegram No. 168 of yesterday). Dhows, &amp;c., belonging to natives which might attempt to run the gauntlet could have their crews, passengers and cargoes transferred to Sultan’s yacht which could be placed at disposal of Senior Naval Officer for conveying these, to Maskat while native craft themselves could be delivered over for sate keeping to nearest local Wali pending a settlement of case against them. Even it not completely effective, institution of blockade measures should reduce re o els to great distress and render their rule far from popular with result that they would be compelled to try conclusions with our troops or resort to an un conditional surrender or leave the country. Proposals for blockade involves some loss to traders generally, and it is a question to what extent it will a ec Prench interests and give rise to protest(s) from Prench Government. At the same time Prench interests are immeasurably less than those of British, and it seems a difficult matter for Prance to decline such modest support to Sultan, while we are doing so much for His Highness. All that the Prench Consul would have to do would be to issue directions to his nationals that the Batinah Coast was in a state of blockade for the time being in so far as food supplies and, of course, military stores were concerned. If these proposals receive sanction in general, Sultan will be prepared to request our co-operation in the matter, and the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gu t and I could arrange the details with His Highness. Pull effect of this not be likely to make itself felt for a month, and meanwhile. Rajputs should not be moved from Maskat unless remaining wing of Grenadiers can relieve them. Otherwise, the stale-mate situation will be maintained indefinitely, and when decision is eventually arrived at to withdraw troops from Maskat, His Highness will be in a worse plight, unless something unforeseen takes place, than he was when we originally came to his support. On the other it is to be hoped a fairly effective blockade will enable us to make a reduc ion in garrison before March next. I have consulted Senior Naval Officer and tiie | Officer Commanding Troops who express their concurrence in these views.Telegram R., No. 1627, dated the 21st (received a2nd) September 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushirc, To The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Please see Maskat telegram No. 109 ot 19tli September. T hid intended to nroceed to Maskat a week hence, as soon as the tht^meantime'tliere seems to me pZd facie to he several flaws or drawbacks in Political Ammt’s present proposal regarding blockade and I had better perhaps state them now so that Maskat may hive an opportunity of consider ing them and perhaps putting me right on some points. , ° r . t r: vi.iipstv’s shin “ l ? ox ” is the only ship now available in Gulf imagine Commander-iJchief would‘have great difficulty m finding the ships for an effective blockade, during which also arms trade from Katr would have to he neglected. Secondly. If blockade is confined to the Batinah Coast, I do not see how it can be effective : the rebel tribes have the season s dates to live on, and, if pushed could obtain supplies through the Trucial Coast or Southern Oman. Thirdly While to seal Maskat and Matrah against import and expor and to conduct a close blockade of Batinah ports would make conditions very penihle for more loval inhabitants, I am not convinced that it would hit rebellious element to extent anticipated, hut am rather inelmed to our expensive operation was finished wo should find Sultan and ourselves in no beUer position than we are now. It was my belief if we could have gone to Samail promptly in the first instance we should in any case have saved the situation as regards security and trade of Maskat and should very ^ e ,^ i j extinguished the rising. Since then disaffection has taken more effective hold tnd situation become more difficult, and I doubt whether any coercive measures which Government can be expected or recommended to h^e wfil provide a satisfactory solution. In fact I think that problem will olher aUemat lo on different lines altogether. But both as regards blockade or °“® r courses I be&lt;* leave to postpone final observations and views until I have been rS’kat. As regards* retention of Indian troops \^ full double companies pins head-quarters regiment, total not less tha hundred men, will suffice for existing requirements at Maskat £ serious developments in near future; and that in order to avmd expense of employing two regiments, the lesser wing, provided its strength is not than three hundred men, will serve the purpose at iJusinre.

MASKAT AFFAIRS. H. M. S. “ Odin ” at Maskat, XI. 13. 18th August 1913. Sir, I have the honour to report the progress of affairs at Maskat during the past week. 2. On the 12th of August, His Highness the Sultan received several letters from various Shaikhs informing him that the Imam’s forces were with drawing and were beyond Bidbid, many of them going to their homes. These letters he forwarded to the Political Agent with remarks showing that he totally disbelieved them, but he stated that he was writing to make further enquiries. I was shown translations of these letters on the 16th instant. 3. It appears to be the general opinion that, though the Imam’s people may have temporarily dispersed, it is probable that they will re-assemble at the end of Ramazan in about a fortnight’s time, and that the danger is not yet finally over. 4. The Political Agent informs me that there is a probability of another battalion of soldiers being sent here and that the present detachment of 2nd Rajputs may return to Bushire where their presence appears to he needed. 5. A reinforcement of 70 men of the 2nd Rajputs from Bombay arrived on the 15th by slow mail. 6. There was a false alarm on the evening of the 17th about 9-30 p.m., two of the forts manned by the Sultan’s men, opening fire for about five or ten minutes, though it appeared obvious to us that there was no real attack, the Sultan apeared to take the matter somewhat seriously, showing that he evidently considered an attack was within the bounds of possibility.

Reports now received state that his advance force under Sayid Hamad I has got between the rebels at Samail and the Political Agent asked if a ship could be sent to Sohar as he considered that possibly the Bidbid and Fanjah rebel force might break away up the coast and threaten British interests at Sohar.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No.M./l3 dated 15th July 1913, I have the honour to report that the situation at present is most unsettled. On Friday, July 18th, the Sultan himself went round to Sib with a view to raising a force to proceed up to Wadi Abth Thabaun and threaten the Imam on the flank at Bidbid. 2. - On Saturday 19th, the Sultan’s eldest son proceeded with 400 Bani-bu-Alis from hereto join up with party at Sib. (It is extremely probable they will refuse to go further as they are the party who retired on Masqat from Bidbid without orders on or about 6th July.) 3. - The Political Agent also proceeded to Sib in H.M.S. ’’Philomel' on Saturday, 19th July, to confer with Sultan as to whether further troops would be required. Political Agent returned the same evening, and sent following telegram on Sunday morning to the Political Resident and Foreign.- Begins -’’’’Philomel’’ July 19th. I am just returning ’’at Sultan’s request after visiting him at Sib. He is ’’arranging to send advance party of Mozaffars men up to ’’Wady Abth Thabaun where they will be joined by Bani 'Jabar and when reinforced by main body of Mozaffars ’’force and others make Isa bin Saleh's pos?Ltion before ’’Bidbid untenable. He asked for three days delay ’’before stating definitely whether he required more he Commander-in-Chief, ’’help H.M.Ships &amp; Vessels, East Indies.&amp; 'means sure that troops would be sent whether he wished 'it or not. I could only tell him despatch was being 'considered. Sultan seemed very confident and content 'and said that if he did not ask for help in three days 'he would not ask at all. He seems convinced that 'situation has changed for the better but I am doubtful. 'Addressed to Political Resident, repeated Foreign' - ends. 4.- On Sunday evening I saw Political Agent who stated he had received news that the Imam had forestalled the Sultan and occupied Wadi Abth Thabaun, and that the rebels had exploded a mine under the Southern portion of Hisn Samail and destroyed one of the wells, and that Sayid Nadir had retired behind an interior screening wall and might possibly be able to hold out for another 15 days. The Political Agent then sent the following telegram to Political Resident and Foreign. Begins - 'No.117. Syud Muhammad has just sent me a 'letter, received from Sheikh S’aud al Jabri, which 'states that, at daybreak on the 19th instant, the Samail 'mine was fired and blew up the south corner of the 'fort, destroying the well-tower and the privy. During 'the s^Lge, however, Syad Nadir has constructed a 'traverse which apparently holds, though, from the 'high ground opposite the south face, the interior of 'the fort is exposed to fire. During the night, the 'garrison have access to another well to supply their 'needs. After this calamity, Syud Nadir cannot, it is 'said'said, possibly hold out for another 15 days. In a 'recent letter, he complains that many of the rifles 'of his followers are out of order. It is now 'suggested that the rebels will try another mine. 'The Bani Jabir, in another letter, report that they 'have been forestalled by Isa bin Saleh in the proposed 'occupation of the Wadi-ath-Thabaun which I referred to 'in my Philomel telegram. This indicates treachery on 'the part of the Bani Jabir and an under-statement of 'the forces of Isa bin Saleh. This news and the letters 'were brought to me by Sheikh Rashid bin Azzayir, who 'despairs of the situation except with the aid of 'Government. He told me that Syud Taimur and he, in 'persuading the Bani-bu-ali to go to Sib, had endless 'trouble.' Knox. - Ends. 5. - I see no prospect of any definite end to the situation here at present, and consider that the only way to achieve this, will be by sending troops to occupy Bidbid and Hisn Samail temporarily and reinstate the Sultan. His troops, as I have before stated, are treacherous and absolutely unreliable. 6. - The 'Alert' arrived at Masqat from Henjam on Monday, July 21st, but I am retaining 'Philomel' for the next day or so in view of the two telegrams above quoted. 7. - The Rajput picquets round Bait al Fala t i report all quiet every morning and also numbers of men and donkeys passing both inwards and outwards daily. 8. - On Monday evening, 21st July, at about 8.0 p.m. the 'Hour al Bahr' (Sultan's Yacht) arrived at Muttra and atat about 9.30 p.m. I received following signal from the Political Agent.- Begins - 'Urgent - Major Knox to S.N.O.- News 'received here that an attack to-night is anticipated on 'Sib. Can you let me have steam cutter to go round to 'see Syud Taimur who is now at Muttra trying to collect 'men. From what I hear it would seem well to have a 'ship at Sib as soon as possible and it would be well to 'have steam up. I would let you know from 'Odin' or 'perhaps you will like to accompany me to Syud Taimur'. ■ Ends. I ordered 'Alert' to raise steam immediately. We left in our steamboat for Muttra at about 10.15 p.m. and learnt from Sayid Taimur that the Sultan was expecting to be attacked at Sib and he had come round for more men. We returned on board at about 11.0 p.m. and Political Agent sent following telegram to Political Resident Begins - 'Knox Masqat to Resident Bushire. Taimur 'returned to-night in 'Nour al Bahr' and showed me 'letter from Sultan in which he was warned of an 'impending attack on Sib to-night. I am proceeding 'to Sib in 'Alert' to-night to stand by and provide 'refuge for Sultan in case of personal risk to him and 'if opportunity offers to assist his forces from the ! feea. Taimur confirms that forces with Sultan 'absolutely decline to move at all up country but he 'does not believe in the impending attack though the 'Sultan evidently does. Taimur thinks that forces with 'Sultan will resist enemy should he be attacked but 'they11.- 'they are a miscellaneous force and their resistance 'will only be-half hearted. Taimur in the 'Nour al Bahr' 'hopes to arrive Sib shortly after we do, viz., early 'to-morrow morning. I have asked him immediately to 'try and arrange for Sultan to come and confer with me 'on board 'Alert' when I will report result without ’delay. Do you think that we should be justified in 'landing Naval Contingent at request of Sultan to assist 'him in holding Sib and to repel the rebels. I have 'read the telegram to S.N.O. and of course a Naval 'contingent would not be landed except from all four 'ships' - ends. 9.- At 12.15 a.m. H.M.S. 'Alert' proceeded with Political Agent and Military Intelligence Officer, the 'Nour-al-Bahr' left this morning with about 100 men from Muttra. At 4.30 a.m. this morning the following reply was received from Political Resident Begins - To Knox, Masqat. 'Yes, I consider we should 'be justified' - ends. 10.- The following signal was received by me from the Political Agent at 10.30 a.m. this morning :- Begins - 'News received here, all quiet. Sultan in 'no immediate danger. He has sent Haineel with 400 men 'forward up to Wadi-ath-Thabaun. He proposes to send 'Taimur forward with rest of forces this afternoon and 'probably return himself to Masqat this evening when we 'shall return in company. I am asking hood kindly to 'stop on here until we see how this project turns out. 'Will let you know further developments. Kindly repeat 'to Resident'. - ends.11.- H.M.S. 'Pelorus” proceeded to Sib this afternoon with a view to arrangements being made for disembarkation of troops in case they should be sent up. The following signal was also received from this Political A$nt this afternoon:- Begins - 'Am trying to get something definite out of 1 'Sultan whom I shall see again this afternoon before 'sunset. News about advance is still conflicting and 'I hear advance Party held up. It seems likely we shall 'have to stop till to-morrow morning unless I can 'persuade Sultan to return to Masqat this evening. 'Hope you can kindly allow 'Alert' to stay' - ends. I have, etc...

I hope this is the culmination of their aspirations. Only As Salimi and the Imam remain in A1 ’Alayah, Samail. The country remains vacant with the exception of the hold on Bidbid.

As Salimi and A1 Kharusi withdrew to A1 ’Alayah. The fort of Samail is in charge of the Bani Rawaha with Muhammad, son of Abdullah bin Sa’id A1 Khalili (at their head?). In the fort of Bidbid there are Bani Riyam, being the people of your servant Ali bin Hamad, the Bani at-Taibih. Hamyar passed by the road along the Wadi (Samail) and perhaps some of the notables of A1 ’Alayah were with him. Their union is destroyed. We pray to God for your help and victory on your enemies.

As Salimi and his son-in-law Al Kharusi remained behind and went over to Al ’Alayah. And they have no force left with them. I request you to do needful about the fort of Samail. Matters are normal by your auspicious presence. God has disgraced their union. It is hoped you will come and take charge of and strengthen your forts and towns.

After compliments. —Your servant went to your town of Samail to ascer tain the views of the Imam’s faction and to see their state of preparation and also to find out how far they are ready to accept peace. I found the matter easy and that peace will be accepted. 1 have woven a fancy cloth of that, after we had examined all the phases, and it depends on your high discretion if you can accept this. After a little time, the tables may be turned and time may restore what you have lost. Then nothing will really be lost. And the terms on which peace is possible are that the possessions in their hands may be forgiven (left) to them. And 'ashoor may be restored to the rates of the time of Imam Azzan bin Kais. And the Bani Biyam should be exempted from paying of duty. This is what they could agree to and we hinted that they should depart and not cause turmoil in Wadi Samail and should think well of Your Highness. They obeyed (consented) and all went away except the Imam and Shaikh As Salimi with 100 men in the fort of Samail and there are 200 men not more at Bidbid.

God has given you the forts without fighting. God is good, and gracious to you and others. This is a lesson for any one who has a living {lit. wakeful) heart. You should prove as God has said—“ Those who, if we empowered them on earth, would observe prayers, give alms, promote good and prohibit evil.” God controls result of everything. Verily God does not spoil the reward of the good. Your goodness has not been in vain and God has granted you such happiness as you could not think of. So, congratulations to you on your victory.

The above news was personally conveyed to the Political Agent at the Agency by His Highness the Sultan, the former leaving for Bait al Ealaj to confer with the Officer Commanding Troops soon after and returning to Maskat in the evening. 332. The “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” was despatched to Sib on the same evening with the instructions that Saiyid Nadir should either return to Maskat or stay at Sib with Saiyid Taimur. The “Nur-ul-Bahr ” returned to Maskat on the 4th with Wali Mozaffar of Sohar and the Bani Umar on board, leaving Saiyid Nadir behind. 333. On the 4th, the news of the fall of Nakhal was also received. It looked as if matters were again taking a bad turn, and, as a precautionary measure, a 3-pounder gun was placed in position on Port Mirani and a Naval detachment stationed there.2 334 The “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” left for Sib on the 7th, returning on the 8th with the Jannabah Bedouins on board.

For the past two days, intelligence that has come to hand from the interior indicates that the rebels have dispersed to their homes. As His Highness the Sultan has no faith in the news, I have not reported this hitherto and at all events there is nothing to prevent their again collecting in force when they choose. Unless the mission j of another battalion of Native Infantry involves some avriere pp,nsee regarding! •which I am not informed, for instance establishment of protectorate over 1 Maskat and Matrah, I venture to deprecate strongly their despatch. If this is I my opinion regarding the proposal, I beg you will kindly consider what view ; Sultan and my foreign colleagues are likely to take of it. I am at loss to ] explain locally despatch of another regiment for the sole purpose of defending 1 Maskat and Matrah, on the littoral, because neither two nor ten battalions in ; defensive position on the Matrah ranges can succeed in inflicting heavy loss 1 on a more mobile enemy who would snipe across difficult ravine at long 1 ranges and immediately disperse when superior forces advanced.

From—The First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla (repeated to Sir P. Cox and Political Agent. JVlaskat). I venture to submit following for consideration of the Government of India w r ith reference to Knox’s telegram No. 14S of 14th August. It was found necessary last year and again this year to reinforce temporarily our Consular Guards both at Bandar Abbas and Lingah in order to protect British lives and property and the necessity of our having to do so again may arise at any moment. Sir P. Cox is, I know, against any further depletion of the force now at Bushire, and it would appear more than probable from Maskat telegram No. 140, dated the 8th instant, that the troops at present at Maskat will have to stay there until some considerable time has elapsed. Furthermore a piracy has occurred already at the bar of the Shat-el-Arab and a request has been received for the despatch of a man-of-war for the date season from His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah. In the above circumstances, apart from the situation which exists at f Maskat, it seems to me very desirable that, if possible, our troops in the Gulf ; as a whole should be reinforced in some way both in order to provide a sufficient margin of safety and in order to free our men-of-war who are now tied to Maskat. The landing of fresh troops from India on Persian soil would be very liable to misinterpretation, on the other hand it appears to me that an explanation might well be given to the Foreign Consuls and to the Sultan of their arrival at Maskat as being necessitated by exigencies of the climate which must render continual outpost duty extremely trying for so small a body of troops at this season of the year. Telegram P., No. 5000, dated (and received) the 16th August 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Han jam, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla (repeated to Bushire and Maskat). Reference my IHrst Assistant’s telegram No. 1418, dated the 15th instant, regarding situation at Maskat. I concur in the views expressed therein. I believe that necessary picket and outpost duty is already found to be sufficiently exacting by the detach ment at Maskat, and it w T ould not be desirable to subject them to it for an indefinite period. This explanation is reasonable and should be sufficient for the French Consul and the Sultan. I recommend despatch of a fresh regiment to Maskat and that on being relieved the present detachment should return to its head-quarters at Bushire, from which it can ill be spared, by the same transport.Telegram, No. 820, dated (and received) the 17th August ]91S.

MASKAT APR AIRS. M.—13. Sir, H.M.S. “ Pelorus ” at Maskat, 22nd July 1913. In continuation of my letter No. 13 M., dated 15th July 1913, I have the honour to report that the situation at present is most unsettled. On Friday, 18th July, the Sultan himself went round to Sib with a view to raising a force to proceed up to Wadi Abth Thabaun and threaten the Imam on the flank at Bidbid. 2. On Saturday, 19th, the Sultan’s eldest son proceeded with 400 Bani* bu-Alis from here ‘to join up with party at Sib. (It is extremely probable they will refuse to go further as they are the party who retired on Maskat from Bidbid without orders on or about 6th July.) 3. The Political Agent also proceeded to Sib in H. M. S. “Philomel” on Saturday, 19 th July, to confer with Sultan as to whether further troops ft} would be required. Political Agent returned the same evening, and sent following telegram on Sunday morning to the Political Resident and ^/AUT ^ Foreign:— * * * rwie Serial No. 64 * * * JkM* 22 H/t. 4. On Sunday evening, I saw Political Agent who stated he had received news that the Imam had forestalled the Sultan and occupied Wadi Abth Thabaun, and that the rebels had exploded a mine under the southern portion of Hisn Samail and destroyed one of the wells, and that Saiyid Nadir had retired behind an interior screening wall and might possibly he able to hold . out for another 15 days. The Political Agent then sent the following -TT ^ telegram to Political Resident and Foreign:—* * * vide Serial ^ NffliS * * » * &amp; fr ** PH* ^ see 110 P ros P ec t any definite end to the situation here at present, ^ ‘ | and consider that the only way to achieve this, will be by sending troops to 1 occupy Bidbid and Hisn Samail temporarily and reinstate the Sultan. His I troops, as I have before stated, are treacherous and absolutely unreliable. 6. The “ Alert ” arrived at Maskat from Hanjam on Monday, 21st July, but I am retaining “ Philomel ” for the next day or so in view of the two telegrams above quoted. 7. The Pvajput picquets round Bait al Palaj report all quiet every morn ing and also numbers of men and donkeys passing both inwards and outwards dailv. * 8. On Monday evening, 21st July, at about 8 p.m. the “ Nur-ul-Bahr’ (Sultan’s yacht) arrived at Matraii and at about 9 - 30 . p.m. I received following signal from the Political Agent '.—Begins, “Urgent. Major Knox to Senior Naval Officer. News received here that an attack to-night is anti cipated on Sib. Can you let me have steam cutter to go round to see Saiyidt 3 Taimur, who is now at Matrah, trying to collect men. From what I hear it would seem well to have a ship at Sib as soon as possible, and it would be well to have steam up. I would let you know from ‘ Odin * or perhaps you will like to accompany me to Saiyid Taimur.” Ends. I ordered “ Alert ” to raise steam immediately. We left in our steamboat for Matrah at about 10-15 p.m. and learnt from Saiyid Taimur that the Sultan was expecting to be attacked at Sib and he had come round for more men. We returned on board at about 11 p.m. and Political Agent sent following telegram to Political Resident:— Begins : —“ Knox, Maskat, to Resident, Bushire. Taimur returned to-night in c Nur-ul-Bahr ’ and showed me letter from Sultan in which he was warned of an impending attack on Sib to-night. I am proceeding to Sib in ‘ Alert * to-night to stand by and provide refuge for Sultan in case of personal risk to him and if opportunity offers to assist his forces from the sea. Taimur confirms that forces with Sultan absolutely decline to move at all up country, but he does not believe in the impending attack, though the Sultan evidently does. Taimur thinks that forces with Sultan will resist enemy should he be attacked, hut they are a miscellaneous force and their resistance will only he half-hearted. Taimur in the ‘ Nur-ul-Bahr * hopes to arrive Sib shortly after we do, viz., early to-morrow morning. I have asked him immediately to try and arrange for Sultan to come and confer with me on board * Alert * when I will report result without delay. Do you think that we should he justified in landing Naval Contingent at request of Sultan to assist him in i holding Sib and to repel the rebels. I have read the telegram to Senior Naval Officer and of course a Naval Contingent would not be landed except from all four ships.” Ends. 9. At 12-15 a.m., H.M.S. “ Alert ” proceeded with Political Agent and Military Intelligence Officer, the “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” left this morning with about 100 men from Matrah. At 4-30 a.m. this morning, the following reply was received from Political Resident:— Begins. To Knox, Maskat. “ Yes, I consider we should be justified. ” Ends. 10. The following signal was received by me from the Political Agent at 10-30 a.m. this morning :— Begins. “ News received here all quiet. Sultan in no immediate danger. He has sent Hainael with 400 men forward up to Wadi Abth-Thabaun. He proposes to send Taimur forward with rest of forces this afternoon and probably return himself to Maskat this evening when we shall return in company. I am asking Wood kindly to stop on here until we see how this project turns out. Will let you know further developments. Kindly repeat to Resident. ” Ends. 11. H.M.S. “ Pelorus ” proceeded to Sib this afternoon with a view to arrangements being made for disembarkation of troops in case they should be sent up. The following signal was also received from the Political Agent this afternoon:— Begins. “ Am trying to get something definite out of Sultan, when I shall see again this afternoon before sunset.

MASKAT AEEAIRS. H.M.S. “ Pelorus ” at Maskat, M.—33. 35th July 1913. Sir, In continuation of my letter No. M.—13 of 8th July 1913, I have the honour to report that H.M.S. “ Odin ” anchored off Matrah on Wednesday inorning, 9th July, and fast mail arrived at 5-30 p.m. on 9th July and was diverted to Matra. All steamboats and 12 lighters went alongside and by 7-15 p.m. all troops, stores, &amp;c., had been landed. A temporary camping ground had been selected and cleared in the morning by Captains Mellor and Ballard, Major Murphy, and myself, just outside town wall on tbe right. 2. The following morning His Highness the Sultan, Political Agent, and Captains of ships, met Colonel Smith at the camp and after some discussion it was thought advisable to move the headquarters of troops to Bait al Falaj with picquets posted on adjacent hills, and that “ Philomel ” should be sent to watch the coast between Has Shateif and Ras al Abyaz. The troops moved out and it was arranged that “ Odin ” should send a picquet of 12 men and maxim at night, to a tower on right at back of Matra, to watch a pass, and also burn her searchlight occasionally.2 3. “ Philomel ” proceeded up coast. I proceeded with Colonel Smith to Bait al Palaj, and as the telephone line to Sib from Maskat passed close to Bait al Palaj, it was proposed, subject to concurrence of His Highness the Saltan, to tap this wire and establish telegraphic communication with Agency On Friday this was done and in the evening messages were passed. As there is some delay in getting messages through, I hav^e proposed to Colonel Smith that I should send two signalmen from this ship to the camp to work this telegraph, and have two at Agency. 4. On Thursday, 10th July, news was received that Saiyid Nadir was still holding out at Hisan Samail, and that 140 rebels had gone to Bidbid, which is some 15 miles nearer to Matra. 5. In consultation with Political Agent, it is not thought advisable at present to land any men in Maskat, as there are plenty of the Sultan’s men there, but if His Highness decides to send a strong force up to relieve Saiyid Nadir, it might be advisable to send strong piequets with maxims to a couple of towers outside the town to guard passes. 6. At present, besides the telegraph line, communication is also kept up through “ Odin ” at Matra and a picquet stationed in hills on right flank of Bait al Falaj. On Sunday evening, 13th July, it was reported by some of tlie Sultan’s men that about 400 rifle shots had been heard some distance to the right of Matra, in the vicinity of Quram. Picquets and “ Philomel ” had heard or seen nothing, and yesterday it transpired that the firing took place at some wedding festivities. 7. The situation at present, loth July, is practically the same as on the arrival of troops, and as far as can be seen, likely to remain so. The Political Agent has wired to Political Resident suggesting that a battalion and two sections of mountain battery be sent to carry out (?) an expedition against Hisn Samail, as the Sultan states he cannot raise a force to go via Sib to relieve that place and Bidbid. Apparently the Sultan can place no reliance on his forces. Political Resident has replied to Political Agent that he concurs, but considers that two battalions should be sent. Candidly 1 do not think the rebels intend to come in, but in the event of news being received of their approach in force, it has been decided, in consultation with Colonel Smith, that 50 men and two maxims from “ Odin ” and “ Pelorus ” should be sent to hold Bait al Falaj, thus freeing the Rajputs at present there as a striking force, the “ Philomel” and “ Pelorus ” at the same time would land sufficient men for the occupation of towers, &amp;c., in the vicinity of Maskat. 8. I have ordered “ Alert,” as she is no longer required at Basrah, to Hanjam to complete with coal and take up Lower Persian Gulf patrol and water launches, &amp;c., as necessary ; in view of “ Minto ” possibly being required shortly to take troops back to Bushire. 9.

Report on the history of the rising of the Imam of Tanuf brought forward to the 31st July 1913, The present lull in active operations seems to afford a good opportunity for presenting a history to date of the Imam’s rising and for taking stock of the present situation of affairs. Causes of rising. 2. It now transpires that, practically ever since the establishment of the warehouse in September 1912, the principal Abbathi Shaikh, Abdullah bin Hamad as Salimi, has been quietly at work, sowing disaffection among the Omani tribesmen. His method has been to misrepresent the warehouse as a subtle device of the English, who had bought over the Sultan to their purposes, for depriving the Omani tribes of modern weapons, and especially of ammuni tion, so that they might reduce them to impotence and then ride rough shod i over them. 3. It has also been suggested that a more recent cause, which may he compared to the match that set alight the combustible material carefully prepared by as Salimi, was the converting to his own uses by Saiyid Faisal of a portion, estimated at dollars 18,000, of the estate left by the lately deceased Kazi of Sohar, Muhammad bin Saif ar Eahaili. The late Kazi was, for this country, wealthy and respected and he died leaving a son his sole heir r Saiyid Faisal’s action, though high-handed, was not, in the customs of the country, unusual but, probably on account of his personal unpopularity which seems unquestionable, gave great umbrage to the “ Mutawwab ” or religious party, who seem to have considered, though it is uncertain on what grounds, that the money should have been devoted to the support of the poorer brethren among them. The immoveable property is nominally in charge of the son. History of rising. 4. The first results of these machinations were the alarmist reports that reached Maskat in the third week of May 1913 that Shaikh Abdullah as Salimi had set up his son-in-law, Salim bin Rashid as “Imam of the Muslimin , \ It was alleged subsequently that Salim bin Rashid, styled al Kharusi, had to he appointed to this honourable position with threats of being2 shot if he did not accept the post. This* Imam malgre lui had commenced sending letters, full of pious quotations from the Koran, to the principal Shaikhs, of the country side. In these letters he called upon them to rise in defence of the Truth and to enjoin on all Muslimin the sacred duty of assist ing the cause even though it were only by their prayers. Nizwah and Rustaq were reported threatened.^ His Highness endeavoured too late to send reinforcements of arms and provisions to Nizwah and Izki, but the communications were in the hands of the rebels and the reinforcements never reached their destinations. T’or instance, on the 3rd of June, news reached Maskat that His Highness* slave, Am bar, who was proceeding to Nizwah with 21 bags rice, 3,000 rounds ammunition and 100 dollars in cash was looted and murdered by the rebels and two more of his party were wounded. 5. But, before the news of this outrage reached us, Maskat was aware, on the 29th of May, that the Imam’s forces were attacking Nizwah and] owing to the treachery of the inhabitants of the quarter called al Muddab, had* established themselves in the town and were pressing hard the two forts and the mosque and the Beyt Salit. On the oth of June, the new r s of the fall of Nizwah reached Maskat. The Wali of Nizvvah, Saiyid Saif bin Hamad, a member of the family of the Al bu Sa’id, committed suicide, fearing to fall into the hands of the rebels. It is stated that the Wali, some months a^o, represented to His Highness the precarious nature of his position, but that the “Khatibs ”, or secretaries, who surround the Sultan insinuated that the Wali was striving to establish his own independence and His Highness took no notice of the appeal for assistance, made to him by his servant and relative. The Wali of Nizw^ah had held his post for about sixteen years. He came into his position by treacherously assassmating, somewhere about the year 1899, one Hillal bin Zahir, a local Shaikh of the Bani Hina, who then held Nizwah fort on his own account, setting at naught the authority of the Sultan. This Hillal had originally been established there by Saiyid Turki, father of the present Sultan; and he held the fort for some 1*2 to 14 years. Saif bin Hamad bin Saif bin Amir, the Wali who committed suicide, \vas a member of the ruling family, Al Bu Sa’id, and his father before him had held Nizwah fort, until he was turned out by the local Shaikh, Hillal bin Hamad of the Bani Hina, already alluded to. Harid bin Hammad, the brother of the Wali, has been imprisoned by the Imam at Nizwah. Pall of Izki and Awaibi. 6. On the night of the 4th June His Highness, now thoroughly awake to the dangers that threatened him, took active steps to reassert his authority and seized some sympathisers of the Imam, who had come from Zanzibar, had bought arms from the Irench merchants at Maskat and were escaping to the Batin eh coast. . His Highness confiscated both their money and their arms to the value, it is said, of one lakh of dollars. Saiyids Nadir and Hamad, second and fourth sons of His Highness, were despatched, respectively, to oamail and Nakhal, the one to assist Izki, twenty miles from Nizvvah, and the other Awaibi, an outpost of Kustaq. Both were seriously handicapped by the reachery and supineness of the Ghafiri tribes, supposed to be loyal to His Highness the Sultan. Not the least serious effort w'as made to relieve Awaibi, which was, after a short resistance, surrendered by His Highness’s Hadhrami akid : the news of its surrender reached Maskat 24th of June. f fi W !j th !' e l ? atd f 0 lz H’ , th n P osit . ioD was little better; the family of al Khalili, o &gt;e am Wullah bin Sa’id al Khalili and his son All, endeavour ed to persuade Saiyid iNadir to proceed to Izki and to take with him from Fort Samail the gun presented by the French Government to the Sultan of Maskat Saiyid Nadir was ordered by his father to do nothing of the kind, and the_\V ah of Sur, Saiyid Hamud bin Hamad, was sent up with Ali bin abdullah 1 T f l “ ahl ‘ t0 . , a f r lst h , ls hunger brother, Saiyid Sa’ud bin Hamad, Wali Kh li-lf 3 :^ ir iTf. rea&lt; : hcd .

Saiyid Sa’ud bin Hamad is now a prisoner the 20th rf June 6 Imam ' 6 neWS ° f the fal1 of lzki reached Mafkat on A3 List of principal rebels. 7. It appears that the fall of Izki was the signal for Shaikh Isa bin Saleh al Harathi, the most active and enterprising of the Hinawiyah Shaikhs, whose name is already familiar from previous Omani risings, openly to espouse the cause of the Imam, whom he joined at Izki. Up till then, he had been sitting on the fence. Hitherto, the Imam’s chief supporter from the tribes had been Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasiran Nabhani, of Tanuf village, the Tamimah of the Rani Itiyam {vide Persian Gulf Gazetteer, page 1591) and the four principal rebels from now onwards may be reckoned to be— Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, the Imam. Abdullah bin Hammad as Salimi, his principal spiritual adviser. Isa bin Saleh al Harathi of the Hinawiyah. Hamyar bin Nasir an Nabhani of the Ghafiri. Position on the 26 th June. 8. Thus, on the 26th of June, the position was as follows :— Nizwah, Izki and Awaibi were in the hands of the rebels. Saiyid Nadir was in Samail; Saiyid Hamad in Nakhal; and Saiyid Taimur, the heir- apparent, with a party of the Ja’alan men, the Bani bu Ali from Sur, was steaming up to Sib with the intention of proceeding to Bidbid, 21J miles inland from Sib and 15J miles from Samail fort. His Highness was much elated at the arrival of the Bani bu Ali, in whom he put great confidence. He was certain that with their arrival, the rising would fall to pieces and the Ghafiri Shaikhs return to their allegiance. The Bani bu Ali were under the command of Muhammad bin Nasir, a nephew of the late Amir of Ja’alan, Abdullah bin Salim al Alawi, who died early in this year. On the 30th of June,. Saiyid Taimur returned and reported that the Bani bu Ali had established themselves at Bidbid and Saiyid Hamad had gone there too. Prospects of an early quelling of the rising were in sight, and it was hoped that Saiyid x\ adir would be relieved at no distant date. 9. On the 2nd of July, Major Murphy, of the Intelligence Department, arrived from Bushire to study the situation with a view to making arrange ments, should the necessity arise, of landing troops for the defence of Maskat and Matrah. He was introduced to His Highness the Sultan, who placed the Naib Wali of Matrah at Major Murphy’s disposal and every assistance possible was given to that officer by the local authorities. Retreat of Sultan’s forces and arrival of British troops. 10. On the 6th of July, the hopes of paragraph 8 were rudely dispelled (1) by the fact of the Shihuh forces, assembled at Nakhal for the relief of Awaibi, falling back on Sohar, and (2) by the unexpected and unaccountable retreat of the Bani bu Ali from Bidbid to Wataiya, an outlying hamlet of Matrah. His Highness had them brought into Maskat for the defence of the town and thereby greatly added to the alarm and anxiety of the inhabitants, as the Bani bu Ali bear an evil reputation for looting and general misbehaviour. It must be added in their favour that, during their stay, no looting of any importance took place, but their counsels were divided, they quarrelled bitterly among themselves, they paid little attention to the authority of their nominal leader, Muhammad bin Nasir, and it was only with great difficulty that they could be persuaded to obey orders of any kind. At the same time, news came that the Imam had reached Samail, Saiyid Nadir was completely surrounded, and that Isa bin Saleh was attacking Bidbid. His Highness appealed to the Political Agent for assistance and he also wrote officially in the same sense to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf {vide enclosure to Maskat endorsement, No. 101, dated 7th July 1913). By good fortune, His Majesty’s ships “ Philomel ” and “ Odin ” were in Maskat harbour, the “ Pelorus ” was on her way and the three ships received orders from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to stand fast till the situation cleared.4 The Political Agent despatched a telegram No. 98, dated 6th July icio asking that the 2nd Rajputs from Bushire might be despatched to defend tl ’ two towns of Maskat and Matrah. ie 11. On the 9th of July, His Hiehness addressed the Political A^ent * writing (vide accompaninent to Maskat endorsement No. 103, dated 9th I j 0 1913) and asked that the Rajputs, who were expected that evenin? bv tl/ fast mail, should be landed for the defence of Maskat and Matrah. ^On th ' 9 arrival that evening, they were duly landed at Matrah for the night Hj 1 * Highness visited Colonel Smith, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the* ne :t morning in company with the Political Asrent, and the Rajputs left* the same day and occupied Beyt al Falaj, a hamlet south-west of Matrah • a was posted on Ruwi village. picquet COMMTJXICATION OF THE POLITICAL AGENT TO REBEL CHIEFTAINS 12. On the 11th of July, the Political Agent wrote to the four rebel Chieftains, already named above in paragraph 7, reminding them of and repeating to them, the warning of 1895 that the British Government, in view of the important interests of British subjects in the two towns of Ma^kat and Matrab, would not tolerate an attack by the Chiefs of Oman on these two places. The letters were delivered by a messenger, kindly supplied bv Hi* Highness, to Shaikh Isa bin Saleh al Harathi at^Bidbid. The Shaikh took the letters and returned the messenger without an answer. A reply was however eventually received, on the 21st of July, through the post from the Imam Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi. This reply was dated the 14th July and the method of its delivery proves w-hat was indeed fully suspected before that the Imam has many friends and sympathisers in Maskat itself; it is polite, savs that the Sultan has long been deposed by the ’Ulamah, hut has refused to abdicate • it warns the Political Agent to desist from troubling, or interfering in, the affairs of the Mushmm. It forms the enclosure to Maskat letter No. 118 dated 21st July 1913, to the address of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 13. The Political Agent, in obedience to directions from the Political Resident, on the 10th of July, took his French colleague into his confidence informed him °f the landing of Entish treops for the defence of Maskat and Matrah at His Highness s request. The intimation was well received and no hint was offered of any objection to our action. 11. On the 13th July, the suggestion was put forward by the Political Agent and supported by the Political Resident that two battalions of Native Infantry of fieid seryice strength with two sections of a Mountain Battery should be despatched to Sib, ready to advance on Samail, if required It was hoped that he lauding of a strong British force would tak^ the Heart out of The thTwHdfsamaTr'TTlQillTl’ 1 ’ 611 ^ f ° r t’® S T ltaa ’ S s - vm P athise ^ to move into tne v&gt; adi samail and quell the rising. In a further telegram dated the iQth July, the Political Resident pointed out that the possession of Samuil and of its two mam communications with Matrah were essential • i existence and security of Maskat and that if « i r n • t ^ e commercla * though a more difficult ,ask bH a Tecessity. ^ ltS reC ^ ture ™ uld - Events at Sib. should be preeeded'There'by a'foree'TTaboutl-r!®^ f ° r ^ arran § !n ? that he Mozaffar bin Suiaiman binSuwaUim Wall ofsT ^ i C ° mmand ° f at M'ataiva a few days previously On thl lofi Wh ° had amved 33 proceeded in H.

The Sultan asked the Political Agent to return that evening to ' Maskat, as the signs of open sympathy and friendship that existed between His Highness and the British representative were misunderstood and objected to by his troops and the Omanis up country and militated against the Sultan’s chances of quelling the rising himself. 16. On the 21st of July, the famous mine, of which much had been heard in vernacular letters to His Highness during the preceding weeks, was fired with partial success at the north corner of Samail fort, but Saiyid Nadir, who had been pluckily holding out all this time and inflicting some loss on the rebels, had made his arrangements to meet this disaster and his position was little affected. The rebels at once began another mine under the principal eastern tower, hut this was a more difficult undertaking and eventually failed, falling in and killing some of the workmen. 17. On the 21st July, in the evening, alarming news in writing was received from the Sultan and brought by Saiyid Taimur to the effect that an attack on Sib was impending that very night. The Political Agent and the Senior Naval Officer at once proceeded to consult Saiyid Taimur, who was on the steam yacht “ Nur ul Bahr”, anchored in Matrah bay and it was decided that the Political Agent, with Major Murphy, should at once proceed in H. M. S. “Alert”, which had arrived that day*to Sib to the Sultan’s support and that the “ Pelorus ” and “ Philomel ” should follow, if the news telegraphed from Sib suggested such a course. It was decided that, in the event of urgent necessity, a Naval contingent should be landed to assist the Sultan in repelling the attack of the rebels and to ensure His Highness’s personal safety. 18. H. M. S. “ Alert ” reached Sib at daybreak on the 22nd and found all quiet there. His Highness had completely recovered his equanimity, was full of schemes for reasserting his authority, had already despatched his son Hamad with Mozaffar’s force on its way to Bidbid and went so tar as to assure the Political Agent that, in eight days’ time, Saiyid Taimur would open the gates of Samail fort and relieve his brother Nadir. After the evening interview of the 22nd, Saiyid Taimur, in a short hurried talk with the Political Agent, was certain that His Highness was over confident; he had no hopes of his own troops, still less of the Ghafiri inhabitants of as Safalah portion of the Samail valley, on whom, in spite of frequent indications of treachery and disaffection, His Highness continued to rely. 19. A third interview took place on the morning of the 23rd. No satisfactory news had been received of Saiyid Hamad’s advance, and Saiyid Taimur had not yet started. At all three interviews, the Political Agent went, as far as he could venture, in urging His Highness to treat the British Government more fairly, warning him that, if the present attempt to relieve Samail failed, there would be no time to relieve Saiyid Nadir or Samail and that its recapture, with the whole country in a blaze of rebellion, would be a very different thing from its relief. He failed, however, to disturb the Sultan’s optimism and returned to Maskat in H. M. S. “ Alert ” the same day. Eeturn of His Highness to Maskat. 20. On the 24th of July, His Highness returned to Maskat about mid day and, before even visiting his palace, came to see the Political Agent. He brought somewhat reassuring news of the movements of Saiyid Hamad, who had penetrated as far as Hamim and Parfarah with little opposition from the enemy, but Saiyid Hammad at the same time cited frequent instances of treachery and it was difficult to build any great hopes on this weak advance, while it was clear that the Sultan’s hopes of a Ghafiri rising in favour of his sons were not being realised. Saiyid Taimur was still at Sib, whither His Highness expressed his intention of returning. 21. On the evening of the 26th July, Shaikh Rashid bin Azzaiyiz, the Sultan’s Secretary, brought further letters, from which it seemed clear that the Bani Jabir and the Siyabiyin tribes, who had been foremost in holding out promises of support to His Highness, were treacherous to the core and only wanted money and ammunition and then refused to meet the enemy. Both6 Saiyids Hamad and Taimur wrote to that effect. Shaikh Hashid further pave instances of the bad faith of the Bani bu Ali and Jennebek, who had sent the rice, given them for their progress inland, to their homes at Sur and had also left behind the ammunitions, with which the Sultan provided them, at Maskat for taking to their homes at the first convenient opportunity and then, on their arrival at Sib, were demanding ^ extra supplies of both food and ammunition. A touch of pathos appears in a remark which Shaikh Kaskid allowed to escape him, when he said that the Sultan, on learning the downfall of all the hopes that he had formed, asked his advisers whether they thought that, if he himself went up country, the tribes would still continue in their treachery. It is notorious that he and Saiyid Taimur are personally very unpopular and that the only one of the sons who would have had the slightest chance of stemming the rising flood of rebellion would have been Saiyid Nadir, who, it appeared at the time, could not, humanly speaking, be relieved. Terms offered by the Imam. 22. The letters brought by Shaikh Eashid contained one enclosure, which appears sufficiently important to quote in full. It sets forth the terms on which the Imam undertakes to refrain from attacking Maskat and Matrah. “ In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate ! “ Let anyone who meets with this letter know that many people have constantly been asking the Imam of the Muslimin to abstain irom fighting the Sultan, Faisal bin Turki, in Maskat and Matrah and they are flattering him (Faisal) in the hope that he will obtain what he demands; but he will not obtain abstention from the Imam except he grant conditions and among them are— “ (1) The agreement in the matter of arms between the Sultan and the Christians must be broken. “ (2) That the Wadi of Samail, Nakhal and Sur should belong to the Imam exclusively. “ (3) The reduction of customs duties in all the ports to the rates that were in force in the time of the Imam Azzan. May God pity him ! “ (I) And that the Sultan and his sons should promote good and prohibit evil to the best of their ability. “Now, if the Sultan grants these conditions in full, we hope from the Imam that he will desist from fighting. And his brother, Nasir bin llashid, wrote it with his own hand.’ , Visit of II. M. S. “Alert” to Sohar. 23. On the 24th of July, at the instance of His Highness the Sultan, H.M.S. Alert left for Sohar to ascertain the state of affairs there and to leassure British subjects. Commander Wood, E.N., on his return, reported that he had landed with Major Murphy, that British subjects were evidently a armed by the prospect of Imam’s coming and greatly reassured by the visit of a man-of-war, that the Arab Naib Wall and the Arab community, though friendly, were evidently much exercised as to what could be the object of the visi and, finally, Commander Mood came to the conclusion that the Arab community ot Sohar had little confidence left in the Sultan and would be disposed rather to welcome the advent of the Imam. it was not until the morning of the 27th, when the Political Agen had an interview with His Highness the Sultan that he was enabled to accoun for the unusual anxiety displayed by His Highness on behalf of Britisl 8U l f] 0 8 S 0 lar • t th en ^.gogpired that His Highness desired to ascertaii = r &lt; 5 TO eH l h A db rr ei - dof thH arriv al, or of the approach, o certain Sha.khs of Abu Dhabi on whom His Highness relied to act as inter uritit ? ir“ n' 1 i llmSe t , L and , the Im;lra - The Naib Wali of Sohar hac Thl P i v hlis ilighness that nothing had been heard of these people at Sohar finals t Agent again asked the Sultan whether he had made up his mini na iy to appeal to us for the suppression of the rising. He informed binconfidentially that, although it seemed clear from telegraphic news that the Government of India were carefully considering the possibility of being appealed to for further assistance, it was quite impossible for them to proffer assistance unasked and that it was by no means sure what decision they would arrive at. His Highness asked for five more days to await the arrival of the Chiefs from Abu Dhabi and expressed disappointment at their delay and failure to keep their promises, though it is not easy to see what assistance they can render him. J 25. Thus on the 27th of July, the outlook for His Highness seemed blank indeed. One would have imagined that it would have been only a question of time for him to find himself at the end of all these false hopes. His procrasti nation had apparently extinguished all hopes of a relief of Samail as the time for a rapid da ; sh on the fort had passed. Its fall within the next fortnight was to be anticipated.^ The result would be to confine the Sultan’s authority, even if only temporarily, to the enclave of Matrah and Maskat, when it would become a question whether British interests would not demand our interven tion for the restoration of order, whether that should be accomplished by— (1) arriving at some understanding with the rebellious tribes, assuming a protectorate over Maskat and Matrah and the environs, together with police rights up the Batineh littoral, leaving our relations with Sur and its hinter land much as at present, or (2) compelling the rebels to submit to their lawful sovereign. 26. But the situation is kaleidoscopic. On the 28th July, in quick succession to a despairing appeal to Saiyid Hamad from Saiyid Nadir, came reassuring news in a letter from Saiyid Hamad to His Highness; they pointed to the practical withdrawal from Samail fort of the rebels, the fears of Shaikh Hamyar for his own life, the return to their allegiance of the Bani Jabir and as Siyabiyin and finally to the prospect of an early advance and speedy victory. At the same time, Shaikh Isa bin Saleh wrote to Saiyid Taimur offering to negotiate with him. It is true that, up to the date of writing, 31st July, no news has been received of a realisation of these hopes, but neither have they been contradicted, nor has Samail fallen and the miraculous restoration of the Sultan’s authority is within the bounds of possibility. The date trade is at a standstill and this must be a matter of as grave concern to the up country rebels as to the British exporters on the coast and it is probably on this chiefly that we must rely for a return to peaceful conditions. No doubt also the plans of the rebels have been upset by the prompt landing of the force of Native Infantry which has diminished their hopes of dictating terms to the Sultan in his own capital. 27. This report is intended to bring the history of the rising up to date and to try and reconcile the contradictory rumours that have marked its pro gress. To attempt at present any forecast of what our future attitude should be with regard to the Sultan and his relations with the tribes of Oman would appear premature. S. G.

After compliments. —To-day my son Hamad and W^ali Mozaffar arrived and with them some of the Shaikhs of the Pani Jabir returning from the Wadi Jayla and, as for the Shaikhs, your honour has seen them and has realised that there is no reliance to he placed on them; And likewise your honour is aware that my son Nadir is besieged in the fort of Samail with a tew members of my family and of my dependents and that they are all in great danger from the rebels; And then, if Samail and Bidbid fall—for this calamity is considered likely to happen—there remains no protection for the trade of your subjects, nay more, Maskat and Matrati will be in danger and never at rest; And all this sedition, as is plain from the notice which you have seen purporting to he from the pretended Imam, Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, is owing to the establishment of the warehouse and to the rules which we have made on the advice of the glorious Imperial Government. Now interested persons have falsely represented this arrangement as a device on the part of you and me to forbid to the tribes of Oman modern weapons and ammunition, so that we may press upon them, seeking to reduce them to slavery. Now, in these circumstances, I hope from my old and sincere friends, the British Gov- f eminent, help in this time of need and I ask from you the despatch of troops, according as the glorious Government shall see fit, for raising the siege of the fort of Samail or its recapture, s^iould necessity call for it, so that the rising may be quelled and peace be restored to my port and my country and to my merchants and yours from the machinations of interested persons and the troubling of the ignorant; and I shall keep the purport of this letter fully secret, until a reply reached me from the glorious British Government.

On the 20th, news was received from Saiyid Nadir to the effect that his position was veiy critical; the enemy had mined the north corner of the tort and informed that they were ready to fire it and enquired if he wished to treat as to surrender and said that if so, he should do so at once. S iiyid Nadir, it is said, returned a replv saying he was prepared for the worst and that they could do what they pleased. A truce was, however, arranged by which hostilities were suspended for the time being. Saiyid Nadir, in a lette'r which he addressed to his father, asked for supply of stores, ammunition, spare springs lor rifles, &amp;c., as his weapons were worn out. He advised his father to have no reliance in Bani Jabir as they had proved disloyal and faith- less* 318. The same night Saiyid Taimur returned from Sib on board the “ Nur-ul-Bahr J bringing news that His Highness had received news that the enemy were threatening Sib. The Political Agent, accompanied bv Maior Murphy, Intelligence Officer, left for Sib the same night on board H. M. S. “ Alert ” to confer with His Highness and support him, if necessary. Saiyid Taimur followed them in the morning on board the “ Nur-ul-Bahr ”. He also took about 100 Sliahu Bedouins who were in Maskat. The Political An&gt;ent and Major Murphy returned to Maskat on the 23rd onboard the “Alert*’. 0 319. On the 22nd, news was received from Sur that an Askari of His Highness had been shot dead by a Jenaba. On hearing of the news about 20 men of the Bani Bu Ali left at once for Sur, but they were brought back for fear of creating difficulties in Sur. 320. H. M. S. “ Pelorus ” left for Sib at noon on the 22nd, returning to Maskat the next d-iy. 321. News was received in Maskat on the 22nd that Shaikh Isa bin Saleh had reached Panjah about ten miles from Sib. 322. With reference to diary entry No. 307, His Highness the Sultan returned from Sib on board the “Nur-ul-Bahr” and came straight to the Agency and conferred with the Political Agent. 3.3. Major Murphy, Intelligence Officer, proceeded to Sohar early in the morning of the 25th on board the “ Alert ” returning to Maskat on the 26th. The “ Alert ” w; s sent, at the instance of His Highness, to enquire for news at Sohar, reassure British subjects and at the same time as an intimation to the rebels that we were closely looking after British interests. On his return, Commander Wood, II.N., stated that he had found British subjects much alarmed, but they were greatly reassured by the visit. 324. With reference to diary entry No. 305, Saiyid Hamad had reached Bidbid. Eighting w ith the enemy had taken place. 3-5. His Highness the Sultan has received a number of letters from various Shaikhs entreating him to make an advance against the enemy and rescue his son Nadir who is in imminent danger. His Highness evidently has do confidence in them and, therefore, takes no notice of their promises to oppose the enemy.(Translation.) In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate.

But the intention is the establishment of justice because evil and bloodshed abound even in the place of government (lit. of the Sultanate). And justice cannot he obtained from the Sultan, and it* has been asked of him and he has not replied, hut he has spread dissension amono« the tiibes and has led them astray to evil. And the meanest country would not consent to this and no religion of the religions would permit it. Then the opinion of the heads of the tribes, the people who loose and bind, has turned to the establishment of justice and the driving away of oppression. And it has \ reached us that a party of your soldiers has landed in the vicinity of Maskat and we do not know the reason of this interference between us and the man ] who has raised up strife against us.

And what has happened to Saiyid Nadir has not sufficed them. So, now our intention is to oppose whoever opposes the truth, insha-Allah ! And they are in your village (country). And you should not prevent us (from coming into your territory or village). So, raise your hands off all (those concerned) i.e. (be neutral). And reply is requested.

May peace and the blessings of God he upon him ! And true faith consists in wishing the welfare of all. And let not false stories of those men who cannot hope for terms or immunity deceive you.

A our esteemed letter reached and your servants under stood its contents. And the letters for Saiyid Nadir also reached us and with great difficulty we sent them on to him. And the reply comes to you with this messenger whom we now despatch. Please acknowledge by return. The news of Samail is as we have already informed you of. And we pray you to use extreme despatch in succouring Saiyid Nadir. We sent one to see the tunnel and he found that it was ready, wanting only a single day’s work, not more. And how wonderful is all this delay on Your Highness’s part while the tunnel is being worked up day and night. And this Government (the enemy) is not strong. If only 1,000 men were stationed in Safalah, they (the enemy) would not stand one hour! And the people of Safalah and the Bani Jabir will lean towards you as soon as you arrive. And now the most injurious thing of all is this tunnel which they did not find hard to work up in the least. And the fort is beleagured. And your servants have been continuously informin 01 you of all this. Saiyid Nadir has had a shower of communications from the aggressors and has not answered them. But, our master ! what is needed, is someone on the opposite side (in face of the enemy). And the best thing would be for you to come forward immediately with succour. And Hamvar only watches when you should appear. The moment you reach Samail he would not stand an hour against right. But it all rests with you. Also trouble has arisen amongst Bani Brahim of Hel, and Muhammad bin Saiyid was struck with a sword while standing in prayer and sustained three severe wounds. And the assailant was his relation Ali bin Muhammed bin Saif. And some shots were exchanged between your servants Aulad Sarhan and Aulad Aziz and a truce has been arranged between them for seven days. We hope our own preceding letters and those from Saiyid Nadir have reached you by hand of Saiyid bin Saiyid. It is rumoured the tunnel has been completed and will be fired on the noon of the 13th (18th July) and God controls every thing. Let this be known to you and we are awaiting your orders.

Praise be to God for tbe unity of hearts! Since we heard about the tunnel, my comrades have resolved to build a wall from the place which you pointed out to us and Insha-Allah by your goodness, all will be well. And about what the Shaikhs have considered proper as to negotiations we have already written to you at length, all that is (known) here, in the previous letters and we think that would be sufficient. Usual ending. P.S.—Look after the needs of my family in my absence. Kindly excuse this trouble, though this is not the time for such a request. You remarked if there should be leisure or opportunity the but this is not possible. Enclosure No. 12, Translation of a letter from Ahmad and Saud, sons of Nasir bin Muhammad, to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, dated the 13th Shaban 1331 H. (18th July 1913). After compliments. —Your esteemed letter reached and your servants under stood what you mentioned. And the letter addressed to Saiyid Nadir will be sent him to-morrow. He and his people are all well, by the grace of God. His reply will reach you. We thought it well to send your messenger back immediately. Then, as to the tunnel, it is ready. We sent trustworthy men and they found it ready and gone into the fort about 5 Ba’a (yards). And gunpowder has reached them from Nizwah about half a Bahar (20 Maskat maunds) in weight. They intended to fire it, but we went to As Salimi and Hamyar and asked them for delay until we informed you. To-ni^ht I sent your servant Saif bin Sallam to Thani and Mohsin. They are going to-morrow to ask for 3 days’ delay. 0 ! our Master, we do not know why there is this delay on your part. If you do not take steps to relieve your son, Saiyid Nadir, he is hard-pressed and without relief from you, most serious consequences will follow. And there is no need to leave troops in Maskat. It is best that they come up here, though it be only 300 men. We do not tell you to do anything except to send reinforcements or relief, and nothing but the goodness of God can be any avail. Salaam. Written with salaams by Saif bin Sallam with his hand. P. S -—And as for Bani Jabir, do not suppose they are any good. Their condition or attitude is notorious. Yesterday Thani had an interview with Nasir bin Bakhit, Sultan and Hamid. Enclosure No. 13. Translation of a letter from Saiyid bin Ali bin Jabar to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, dated the 13th Shaban 1331 H. (18th July 1913). After compliments. —A letter has already gone to you by the hand of the man ’Amen and I understand that he delayed in the village of Jayla. Then I informed you by another letter, by the hand of one of your servants, which I think reached you this morning. We have detailed all information for you. As reprds news of Bidbid, Isa is besieging it, and those of the Bani Kawaha and the people of Iski who are with him, are altogether about 250 men and not more. And those who are in Samail with As Salimi and the Imam and Hamyar, are 400, not more in any case. I sent out one to reconnoitre them in their camp and this is their force. We communicated with some of those in the towers. Bam Taubah and others who are with them gave them hopes and they relaxed m seventy of firing. The booma (tower) that was newly made by Salaiyim commanding (Shaikh) Rashid bin Uzaiz’s house exposes the fort. And after we had secretly communicated with the aforesaid, the firing was relaxed by them except at intervals when their fellows remonstrated with them and they cannot give out what we have communicated. Further, the greatest danger is the mine that they have made from Jalbat al Mualhmin opposite the well, that is in the fort. Now it is said that it hasreached the base of the well tower. And we desired Hamyar to remain behind when his companions would go forward (not to join them) and we were unable to persuade him. And we gave him hopes (of reward), but he would not consent, without Samail and Bidbid. So now, know, our master ! we sent Mohsin and Thani (Shaikh of Bani Jabir) to the disloyal and if we find any shame left in them, we will apply to Hamyar and As Salirni to delay the mine until we can inform you; and our object is that they may be delayed until your arrival. And you know, they are now making the best of their time and see no one to stop them. And they do not consent to anything at all. And we urge you to expedite your arrival and victory from God is before you! And the people of this direction will, in any case, be with you and in front of you. Please my master make haste! Make haste! And come, because the mine is ready. And if you delay, then you will be to blame and come forward with what troops you have. Their total number is as we have detailed already and not more, by God. And their force is daily decreasing, but our fear is on the score of the mine, which is ready ; and yesterday they brought gunpowder from Nizwah. And a hag of saltpetre* was obtained from Ai Alayah. And as to the people of Sifalah, every one of them brings forward one thing or another. Everything cannot possibly be put down on paper. We hope God will support you and grant you victory over your enemies, but make haste! make haste! Nothing is before you at all. And the enemy at Bidbid will at once take to flight by Al Uqq and run away and the garrison and yourselves and the people of the town, who will join you, and those who might join you from the neighbourhood, all being against them for one thing or another,—will immediately make them turn round and fly away. But if you delay, the worst fears will be realized, of which there can be no idea. For God’s sake ! do not listen to any one advising you to delay even one hour. Eor God’s sake! Be pleased to pity (recurringly) Saiyid Nadir ! and the mine is ready! Do not be deceived by doubt. Eor God’s sake! (4 times) and salaam. P. S .—The letter to Aulad Nasir was sent with your servant Hamad bin Ahmad Ar Ruwaihi who will deliver it to them. We pray to the Almighty God providentially to facilitate the delivery of the letter. But delay will do no good. Make haste 1 Make haste ! the mine is ready. If you delayed, you would blame yourself when blame will be of no avail. Eor God’s sake l (4 times). Have pity ! Have pity ! My master ! this is not the time for delay or remissness, on the other hand it is the hour for despatch! Eor God’s sake (3 times). There is no turning away (from evil) and no ability (to do good) except with (the help of) God, the High, the Great! We have asked Thani and Mohsin to come in order to confer with them. God is good ! (Wonderful) that when they arrived they turned towards the Imam and his following : like the sands they cannot be kneaded. This direc tion has not been spoilt or ruined except by these Shaikhs beings made as they are. They tore people away from one another and destroyed their unity. They are of no use, but evil is to be feared at their hands. I?nds. Note thereon from His Highness the Sultan at Sib to Saiyid Taimur. AJter compliments .—We reached Sib at 3-30 (9 a.m.) and did not find anything of news except these letters which we send to you. After perusal, hand them over to the Political Agent. Salaams to friends. We chose to stay in Sib rather than sitting up in Maskat, till it pleases God !

And we have applied to Saivid Faisal for help with men to strengthen the party on this side, but we find'that none has been appointed or sent out. Still it does not matter. We went to those insurgents some days ago and asked for a truce in order to see if We could join Your Highness, but we could not manage that. Now we hear that a mine is being laid, but do not know the truth of the matter. To-day, we went and conferred for suspension of hostilities for to-day up to sunset and this was consented to. Similarly we ask you to suspend fighting up to sunset to-day. And be pleased to send to us some of your friends whom you may like to parley with us as to what is expedient. Some one will come (on our behalf) to accompany your delegate to the camp (or place) of Aulad Basir bin Mohamed. And if you chose Aulad Nasir will approach you. It depends on you and we await reply and salaam. Enclosure No. 15. Translation of a letter from Saiyid Nadir to His Highness the Sultan, dated the 13th Skaban 1331 H. (18th July 1913).

Nothing remains to be hoped from Bani Jabir and the people of that valley, except deceipt and disloyalty. The Bani Jabir who were with brother Hamad, were the first to desert when fighting began at Bidbid. Brother Hamad is now in Jay lab.

Tour own w isdom is a thousand tim better. Now, what are your orders ? Brother Hamad and some of his m 68 have come back without reaching the fort (of Bid bid) and those w'ho turn^ back have not yet arrived here. This (neighbouring) jungle is being da l patrolled by our horsemen close up to where the routes go out to the interi ^ of Oman, but none of the men has been seen.

We talked with them about what we are ordered to do (raise the siege of Bidbid). We found them unable to go out (to fight) and Thani said “ If your desire is to fight with those people, send double your present troops.” Then we could not get any decided reply from them except that one day before we arrived they had been to Hamyar bin Nasir and had asked for some sort of decision that he would abstain from fighting. Then he would not accept except on some conditions which he wishes to impose on you. And we find those conditions difficult to accept and we asked them to let us stay in Jaylah and they pledged us that we might stay until your reply came. And in all this company we see no sincere friend for you at all. And the Siyabiyin are manifesting signs of hostility and the opinion is yours. And we shall obey whatever you order us to do. Usual ending. E.S. —And do not hope for any benefit from Mohsin and Thani (Shaikhs of As Siyabiyin) except for the hope of food in all this affair. And as soon as we came out from Sib, a letter was sent out to the rebels warning them of our advance. They said that we were 200 men and that the rest were unwilling to advance. And that letter came from Sib. And the allowances of your servants Muzaffar and the Bani Umar are overdue. They are asking us for it, for there is great scarcity and dearness of provisions in this country, so, of your generosity send them money, and those of Muzaffar’s men who have remained at Sib, kindly pay them also their allowance and send Muzaffar and his companions the allowances here unless you order us to return, in which case keep the allowances until they return.

The people here have all of them been unfaithful to me and there is none in your favour, neither the Siyabiyin nor any other people. They are no good and only care for the daily allowance. If you want to fight, the people of Oman then do not place hope or faith in these tribes, none of which can be of any use to you. As you are aware they only talk a great deal. Please do not ignore to send reinforcement. The news of Samail, too, that reached here to-day are known to Sulaiman (bearer).

Maskat affairs. ^1—13. H. M. S. “ Pelorus ” at Maskat, Sir, 8th July 1913. With reference to Persian Gulf Weekly Report, dated 8th June, page 2, I have the honour to report that on my arrival here, I first heard officially of the disturbances in the vicinity of Maskat, and since my arrival have obtained the following information. 2. The rebellion against His Highness the Sultan of Maskat originated at Tanuf about the third week in May; the Chief Abadhi Shaikh Abdullah-bin- Hamid-as-Solimi, having proclaimed Jehad (religious war) with the object of setting up his son-in-law Salim-bin-Rashid-al-Kharusi, the cause being the alleged leaning of His Highness the Sultan towards foreign Governments and Institutions. The towns of Nizwa and Rustak were threatened. His High ness the Sultan sent his son Saiyid Nadir (second son of Sultan) to Bidbid. On 29th May news reached Maskat that Nizwa had been attacked and that there had been 12 casualties on His Highness’s side. 3. About the first week in June news was received that Saiyid Nadir had moved up the valley with 70 men to Hisn Samail, where he is now surrounded. Awabi and Izki were occupied by the Imam’s men about the end of first week in June. 4. His Highness the Sultan has now no troops between Hisn Samail and Matrah. The rebellious faction now comprises practically the whole of the tribal confederacies known as the Ghafiri and Hinawi, and they have sent an intimation to His Highness that they intend shortly to attack and loot Maskat and Matrah. His Highness has been sending his yacht at intervals to the seaport towns of Khasab, Sur, &amp;c., and collecting troops for the defence of Maskat and Matrah, and on the morning of 6th July personally asked the Political Agent for assistance, and Political Agent’s telegram No. 98 and also two from Military Intelligence Officer were despatched on Sunday forenoon, asking for troops to be held in readiness to be sent. 5. On Monday morning, 7th July, Commander Ballard, Military Intelligence Officer and myself, visited town wall and defences of Maskat and came to the conclusion that 100 men with 4 maxims landed, posted at certain towers for defence of town, property, &amp;c., would command all passes leading thereto. 6. The 250 Rajputs are due to-morrow evening at 5. p.m. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, P. M.

The troops moved out and it was arranged that 'Odin' should sent a picquet of 12 men and maxim at night, to a tower on right at back of ’futtra, to watch a pass, and i also burn her searchlight occasionally. 3*~ 'Philomel' proceeded up coast. I proceeded with Colonel Smith to Bait al Falaj and as the telephone line The Commander-in-Chief H.M.Ships and Vessels, Fast Indies.lino to Sib from Masqat passed close to Bait al Falaj, it v/as proposed^ subject to concurrence of His Highness the Sultan, to tap this wire and establish telegraphic communication with Agency. On Friday this was done and in the evening messages were passed. As there is some delay in getting messa^s through, I have proposed to Colonel Smith that I should send two Signalmen from this ship to the camp to work this telegraph and have two at Agency. 4.- On Thursday, 10th July, news was received that Say id Nadir v/as still holding out at Risn Sam&amp;il and that 140 rebels had gone to Bidbid, which is some 15 miles nearer to Muttra. 5. - In eonsulRtion with Political Agent, it is not thought advisable at present to land any men in Masqat as there are plenty of the Sultan’s men there, but if His Highness decided to send a strong force up to relieve Sayid Nadir, it might be advisable to send strong pickets with maxims to a couple of to ers outside the town to guard passes. 6. - At present, besides the telegraph line, com munication is also kept up through ’’Odin” at Muttra and a picquet stationed in hills on right flank of p ait al ^alaj. On Sunday evening, July 13th, it was reported by some of the Sultan's men that about 400 rifle shots had been heard some distance to the right of Muttra, in t e vicinity of Quram. Picquets and n Philomer had heard or seen nothing, and yesterday it transpired that the firingfiring took place at some wedding festivities. 7. - The situation at present, July 15th, is practically the same as on the arrival of troops, and as far as can be seen, likely to remain so. The Political Agent has wired to Political Resident suggesting that a battalion and two sections of mountain battery be sent to carry out an expedition against Hisn Samail, as the Sultan states he cannot raise a force to go via Sib to relieve that p 1 ace and Bidbid. Apparently the Sultan can place no reliance on his forces. Political Resident has replied to Political Agent that he concurs but considers that two battalions should be sent. Candi dly I do not think tho rebels intend to Some in, but in the event of news being received o' their approach in free, it has been decided, in consultation with Colonel Smith, that 50 men and two maxims from 'Odin' and ,f Pelorus ,, should he sent to hold Bait al Falaj, thus freeing the Rajnuts at present there as a striking force, the 'Philomel” and 'Pelorus” at the sane time would land sufficient men for the occupation of towers, etc. in the vicinity of Masqat. 8. - I have ordered 'Alert”, as she is no longer required at Burseh, to r en3am to complete with coal and take up Lower Persian Gulf Patrol and water launches, etc as necessary; in view of 'Minto' possibly being required shortly to take troops back to Bushire. 9. - H.M # S.'^hinx' is visiting pearl fisheries, as Political Resident has suggested postponing his trip concerningconcerning enquiries re 'Perseus' missing cutter (vide his telegram o # lP '0 of 14th duly) until affairs at Masqat are settled.

With reference to diary entry No. 269, the “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” returned from Sur with about 300 Jannabah Bedouins and landed them at Matrah for the protection of that town. 282. On the 6th great excitement prevailed in the town of Maskat. News was received that Saiyid Nadir was surrounded by the enemy on all sides and was fighting with them with only about 80 men, the rest bavino&gt; deserted him. The Bani bu Ali who were at Bidbid, vide diary entry No. 259, being unable to proceed to the scene of troubles were brought to Maskat in tow of the Sultan’s steam cutter by Saiyid Taimur, it is said, much against his wish. These Bedouins on arrival got scattered all over the town of Maskat thus increasing excitement and fear of the populace. Merchants packed up their goods, secured and closed up their shops for fear of loot. His Highness beat drum calling in all people living outside the gates of the town and asking those who possessed no weapons to come and receive same at the palace. Towards the evening of the same day the Agency peon was sent round to inform British Indian subjects warning them to bring their valuables at the Agency for safe custody and by 5 p.m. large sums of money and other valuables were received for deposit. 283. Bis Highness has himself packed up his own valuables to move to the fort in case of necessity. 284. On the 7th, Saiyid Hamed returned from Nakhal. 285. On the 8th, news was received in Maskat that Shaikh Isa bin Saleh had reached Bidbid and was fighting with the Sultan’s garrison there. 286. H. M. S. “ Odin ” moved to Matrah bay. 287. On the evening of 9th, S. S. “ Dwarka ” landed at Matrah 250 men of the 2nd Bajputs. Colonel Smith who is in command has taken up a strong position S. S. W. of Matrah and Maskat for the defence of these towns. Head-quarters are at Bait al Falaj and Rooi is also occupied. 288. On the morning of the 10th, His Highness accompanied by the Political Agent proceeded to Matrah to confer with the Commanding Officer of the troops and returned the same morning. 289. On the same day a messenger arrived from Saiyid Nadir with a letter in which it was stated that Saiyid Nadir was well and had inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. H.M.S. “ Philomel ” moved towards Darset. 290. On the 11th, it was reported that His Highness wished the Jannabah Bedouins who are now in Matrah to go to Saiyid Nadir’s rescue. They assented half-heartedly, and about 30 of them left for Sur. They at the same time gave His Highness to understand they had not come to fight but to try and compose differences and had written letters to the heads of rebels to that effect. 291. It is interesting to note that on the 8th it was reported to Hi s Highness that Muhammad-bin-Hamed, nephew of Shaikh Sa’id-bin-Nasir Ak Kindi had within the last few days loopholed a stone wall overlooking the c/6/9ny2 westerly tower of the Maskat town wall and the residential buildings of His Highness the Sultan. Saiyid Taimur went and found the place as reported and had it pulled down. The man was well caned and dismissed. This is a characteristic trait of the Mutawwa (orthodox Abazi) party in Maskat who show themselves ready almost to assault any one who speaks against the so- called Imam.V 83 No. 119, dated Maskat, the 21 st July 1913 (Confidential).

And as for Faisal, the ’Ulama have risen against him often times after his deprivation and deposition (from the Imamate). And he refused to resign and has kept his seat this long time past by the road of violence and wrath and the Moslems were displeased with his Sultanate and his acts. And you are a company of this Government. It is incumbent on you to refrain from the. affairs of the Moslems, and it is necessary for you that vou should not do us injury.

On the night of the 22nd, the “Nur* ul-Bahr ” left for Sur with Saiyid Taimur on board returning on the 26th with about 300 fighting men. The Sultan interviewed Saiyid Taimur on board and the ship proceeded to Sib with all on board whence they are to proceed to Sui\ Saiyid Taimur will remain with the fighting force. 254. News reached Maskat on the 23rd that fighting had commenced at Awahi. There were several casualties among whom the name of Saiyid- bin-Eashid* an influential Shaikh and supporter of the Imam, was mentioned. Saiyid Hamad, who is at Nakhal, is reported to have imprisoned several persons who were suspected of giving assistance to the Imam in the way of arms and ammunition. The inhabitants of Rustak are also reported to be resisting the Imam. Saiyid Hamad was to march on Awabi. 255. With reference to diary entry No. 243, the Imam addressed a letter to Saiyid Nadir on the 16th June 1913 warning him that he should leave Samail as an attack on that place was imminent and that he should not rely on his fighting men for any support. 256. About the same time, His Highness the Sultan received a letter from Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh Al-Harithi in which he stated that the Imam had pressed him to join his cause and that he proposed to do so and would start on the 15th Rajab 1331 (21st June 1913), with a handful of fighting men. In the same letter Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh complained of not getting any reply from His Highness to his letters. 257. On the 24th, the news of the fall of Awabi reached Maskat. It was said that His Highness’s garrison there had deserted the headman leaving him helpless. 258. His Highness the Sultan interviewed the Political Agent on the 23rd and 26th in connection with the disturbances. 259. News reached Maskat on the 27th to the effect that Saiyid Taimur and his party were at Sib and were unable to proceed for want of trans port. 260. The “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” returned from Sib on the night of the 26th and proceeded to Sur to bring more fighting men. Enclosure No. 2.

The “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” returned from Sohar on the 30th June with Saiyid Taimur on board and left again for Sohar in the night with Saiyids Taimur and Ziyab to collect fighting men. She returned to Maskat being unsuccessful on the 4th with Saiyids Taimur and Ziyab. It is said that men from Sohar refused to partake in the fight against the Imam. 267. With reference to diary entry No. 257, the headman Sherif, of the fort of Awabi, with 20 paeu, arrived in Maskat on the 2nd July. It is COPY TO FOREIGN OFFIC 12 AUG 19132 said Sherif paid the Imam $1,200 for his safety and subsequently surrender ri the fort to the enemy. The reason given by Sherif for his action is that h had no ammunition to defend the fort. His Highness is said to be mu h annoyed with Sherif, but has not yet punished him. 268. News reached Maskat on the 4th that the Imam and Shaikh Isa-bi . Saleh had reached Samail and fighting had commenced. It is said the'tw* tribes—Hanawi and Ghafri—who were with Saiyid Nadir have now o*one o° the Imam’s side. Saiyid Nadir’s force is said to be small. b n 269.

From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Saiyid Faisal paid me another visit this morning. He was very civil and said that he was much obliged for the prompt payment of the 30,000 rupees instalment. I replied that it was for us to be grateful to him for his steady ! support of our policy. His Highness came to see me on his return from the “ Noor al Bahar ” which returned this morning bringing Saiyid Timur, Muham mad bin Isasir al Alawi and 400 men of Jaalan and among them, His Highness said, were “ Hisham ” and “ Bani Basib His Highness seemed very much elated by the arrival of the Jaalan men and said that now all the Ghafiri tribes would come over to his side. He also told me that there was some hitch about the forces of the Imam entering the Wadi Ismail; either the Bani Ruwaha refused to allow the Bani Biyam to enter, or the Bani Biyam themselves refused to enter, the Wadi Samail. I think I have told you Awabi has fallen. His Highness told me that it was one Marghuf of the Ayal Saad who was instrumental in bringing about the surrender. The commander was bought out. Nasib told me that the commander was only interested in defending the money which he has amassed as a retaOer of arms and that when that money was paid to him, he surrendered the fort. It appears that Saiyid Hammad is now in Nakhal and Saiyid Nadir in Samail whither Saiyid Timur will proceed with the Jaalan men, disembarking them at Sib or Burka. The “Noor al Bahar ” has now (noon) left for the Batina. I hear Isa-bin-Saleh has reached Izki, but with only a small following, as he said in the letter which I sent on to you. I told Saiyid Faisal that I had asked for Murphy “ex abundante cautela ”, so that he might look around and see what precautions it might be necessary to take in the event of strong measures being inevitable. His High ness approved and said that he saw no harm if one of the launches, in about ten days* time, ran up the Batina coast and back, touching at the ports en route, to reassure our nationals. He explained that he had carefully abstained from asking assistance so far, as he was anxious that a small affair should not grow into a big one, as it certainly would, if the English showed great activity. This seemed an eminently sensible view. If any more news | of interest comes along by Monday, I will try and write to you again on the subject. So far the rising does not appear serious, though it is troublesome. Enclosure No. 2. Dated Maskat, the 30th June 1913 (Confidential). From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have little to add to my letter of the 26th June, though, this morning, I duly conveyed to His Highness the message of your telegram No. 1153, dated 28th June 1913. His Highness was rather busy, as the “ Noor al Bahar ” had just come in with Saiyid Timur. The latter said that the Imam and2 Isa-bin-Saleli are still in Izki and that 600 men from Jaalan hare read \ Bidbid, under the command of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, a nephew of th U Amir, who died lately. Shaikh Ifammad is there too. Saiyid Nadir wanted these Jaalanies in Samail, but the Sultan will not I them go there, as he fears that the Imam’s forces might wander round by tl ■\Vadi Aqq and he hopes that at Bidbid they will cover the coast mark oJ? Matrah and Maskat effectively. c I have also had some letters read over to me from Saiyid Nadir an i others. tin(i On the 22nd of Eajib (27th of June), Saiyid Nadir writes “ When Isa-bin Saleh came to Izki, Abdullah-bin-Said A1 Xhalili (Hinawdyah Shaikh of Ai Alaiyah and of the Bani Kuw'aha) and the people of Wahiba (also iiinawivai ) consulted among themselves and the matter was difficult for them and the knew that if the (rebel) army reached (Samail), they might be fought a^ains't by the fort (in which is Saiyid Nadir) and they wanted to consult them (the Imam, Isa, &amp;c.) and see w r hat their intention might be. Then the Sultan fhin Mansur, Shaikh of the A1 Wahiba) desired to go to them and asked leave of us for this purpose and we gave him leave.” (W.i?.—This man’s father Shaikh Said-bin-Khalfan A1 Khalili, chief adviser of the Imam Azzan w-w killed by Saiyid Turki. A letter from Skaikh-bin-Salam of the Shaikhs of Samail, written on 21st Eajib to Shaikh Eashid-bin-Azayaz, says—“Anri as for the Shaikh Khalili and the A1 Wahiba, they have advised the Imam to pass by Jayla and not to come by A1 Alayah. Wadi Jayla is full of Bani 3ab.r of the Ghafiri” The letter goes on to say that aU these LoT including the inhabitants of Samail, are all traitors. * 1 1 ’ I have also seen a letter from All-bin-Abdullah-bin-Said al Khalili to aiyid Nadir in which, after excusing himself for the surrender of Izki (which was mainly due to his All’s treachery), he says that he met Isa-bin-Sa eh at Shak-hf , 3 'r n . len f aiK ! «'f. latter was ready to mediate, but the Imam and from sufh efforte. ^ t0 ^ talk ° f peaCe and told him to deslst l th v.t g , encral attl J uda of tll0se about me and Saiyid Faisal’s demeanour s ther that reports from the front are reassuring and that at least there is immediate danger of an attack on Matrah or Maskat or on the coast ports. consignment kFnTJ podoeman tcl . 13 me ‘hat Ali Khan lost a fine big Ni' all ifi, r fV“ d ,^“?, ltlon 'r hioh the Imam confiscated wheS -Mzua leu. it is an ill wr ln( i that blows nobody any good.

Said-bin-Saleh As Sanaidi Bal buKan Bani-bu-Ali is friendly to their rivals, the Timur arrived yesterday in the •&lt; Noor al Bahar ” from Sohar which is quiet. Hammad is still in Burka, Muhammad-bin-Nasir Al Alawi and Muhammad-bin-Badar-bm-Saif in Bidbid, and Nadir in Samail. d It was on this day in the forenoon, when I was very busy surprised by a visit from Monsieur A. B. Menasche who cam's' as Agent fir the Field Rifle Company, Messrs. Laubenburg, had been told that morning by His Highness that Menasche mm made overtures of some kind to Saiyid Kasim with a view of ascertaining wither it would be possible to obtain permission to reship those goods for Europe. He said the same thing to me and I thought there was no point in bandying' words with him as to his late apparently unserupulous conduct. He also to.d me that his principals had informed him that they had learnt that certain concessions might be arranged for them and he would be clad to learn the nature of those concessions. I replied that I was not in a positiou to say exactly what the nature of those concessions might be off hand, but that an indispensable preliminary would be submission to the warehouse at least to the extent of formally claiming the arms. He said that it would be impossible for his principals to get rid of the arms by retail sale. I said that I thought he exaggerated the difficulty and that, if his principals submitted to the warehouse, I could probably arrange for a wholesale riddance of their stock. I then got rid of him, as I was thronged with work. On the 6th of July, while Captain Ballard, B,. N., of the “ Philomel ” and Iwere inspecting the new coal jetty which I was taking over from the? Public VVorks Department, we were rather surprised to see His Highness row up alone to the jetty to meet us there in a small helium, rowed by three boatmen only. He came and gave me the news that resulted in my telegram No. 98 of 6tb July 1913, and I made it clear to him that he was definitely asking for our intervention and that I should ask for troops to be landed at Matrah. D He tally concurred and, of his own accord, turned round to Captain Ballard, as he left, and said that he would be detained here at Maskat longer than he expected. His Highness seemed greatly cast down by the retreat of the Bam-bu-Ah. The Bani-bu-Ali were brought back by His Highness from Watiya,. as my telegram No. 98 was being despatched. Ihey are at present billeted in and around the mosque that Nasib built. I have warned their Shaikh, Muhammad-bin-Nasir Al Alawi, against looting, and he assured me Jat he would look after his men. I have so far received no serious complaints of their conduct, though, of course, their evil reputation is notorious and Butish subjects are depositing their valuables in the Consulate for sale custody. His Highness has, by beat of drum, warned all inhabitants of the suburbs that it is unsafe to stay outside the walls at night.4 Murphy has been studying the locality and the question of supplies. Ue has been the round of the suburbs of Matrah, Darsait, M atiya, It,awi, under the charge of the Saib Wali of Matrah, whom he praises as one of the most intelligent and well-informed guides he has ever met. has been ^ extremely well received everywhere, has got all the information that he needed and far more than he expected. He tells me that he has made an exhaustive examination of Matrah itself and its capabilities. The feultan placed his launch at his disposal one morning. On the 7th July, while I was interviewing the Sultan, Hill, Ballard and Murphy made the round of Maskat and came to the conclusion that they could easily hold Maskat town itself from the walls with 100 men from the ships and four maxims. If troops are landed from Bushire or elsewhere, Murphy thinks that the strategical point is Rawi, which would enable us to screen both Maskat and Matrah and get our people out of the town’s confusion. This last is the latest news that I gleaned from His Highness this morning. Saiyid Hammad-bin-Faisal returned to 'Watiya at the Asr yesterday. At Bidhid, there is still a small garrison of 12 Hadhramies under the sons of Salim- bin-Said, A1 Akbari. They really ought to be 30 men, but as usual the Akid draws the money for 30 and keeps up only a dozen. These men had a brush with the Bani Jahir, who, on hearing of the departure of the Bani-bu-Ali and the Shihub, tried to take the fort, but were driven back with the supposed loss of four men. In the Wadi Aqq is a miscellaneous company of Suris, drawing pay for 70 men, but probably only 40. At Samail, there have been a few casualties on the side of the enemy, especially at the house of Shaikh Rashid-bin-Azaiyaz and the bazaar, which Isadir has been cannonading. Possibly 12 men killed and wounded on the night of the Imam’s arrival. The “Noor al Bahar ” has gone to Sur to try and get more men. The Commander’s orders are if they cannot get them, the “ Noor al Bahar ” should bring away the garrison. His Highness explained to me that the object of this rather singular order was that the Suris are so afraid of the Bani-bu-Hassan that, if they heard that, otherwise, Sur would be denuded of its garrison, they would be induced to send along a sufficient contingent.

And as for what you say that you cannot excuse yourself from the orders of Maskat, then know, Oh Shaikh ! that I see no profit for thee in fighting the Muslims and let not the world deceive you nor what it contains. And whoever fights the Muslims has met with nought but loss and to learn from the past sufficeth a wise man. And, as you are aware, the Al Wahiba left Samail, after they were convinced of the manifestation of Islamic rule. Ay! Ay! Oh Shaikh!

So I have sent you this messenger for information. Usual ending. Written by his order by your servant Sulaiman-bin-Sanan with salaams. Certified that this is from your servant Isa with his hand. P- After I had parleyed, there came to me a messenger to forbid (the talk of peace), while I was in the village of Saddi. Then came Shaikh Sultan- bin-Mansur and prolonged (the interview about peace) but found it impossible. I acknowledge that peace had been made between us (i.e., himself and His Highness) through Shaikh Zaid (of Abu Thabi). (During peace), I did not attempt to do anything that would injure you. But now, after the receipt of this my letter by you, no responsibility or obligation remains between us any longer. I have vowed myself to “ Jahad ” and the inforcement (of good) and the prohibition (of evil). I pray to God to preserve me from a breach of this vow. AVould that I should find any of my wise or thoughtful brethren inclined (to peace) and that they should speak, as I have spoken ! And should I find {them so inclined), a messenger will come to you from me, please God.

Translation, Letter from Shaikh S’aud Lin Ali al Jabri to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, dated the 11th July 1913. After compliments.—We have formerly sent letters to you and hope they have arrived. Then we inform you about these rebels, Bani Biyam; we have approached them with reference to abstaining from fighting against the Port and now the siege is slackening and the loop-holes are further away from the fort; . and there are many wounded and dead among the enemy; and none of the friends of Saiyid Nadir have been injured except that the gunner was slightly wounded at the beginning of the affair. And we have informed you about Isa going off to besiege Bidbid at the request of the Haddariyin; and they have not approached it but have alighted in the date trees of the Maha- shilah. And to-day a messenger has arrived desiring the Bani Bawaha to send him 100 men. And the whole forces of the enemy are less than 2,000 men and they would not amount to that much, were it not for the people of Sayma and Muharram. And yesterday we addressed Himyar by the tongue of Muhammad and to-day we have met together and have addressed and have done our best to make him refrain. And he says—“ I have given my promise and pledge and cannot break them, but it is better that the Shaikhs of the people of Sur should come and those of the Jaalanis who are with them and should address themselves to Isa and with them Shaikh Bashid; and that they should ask. Isa to go between and that he should assist those who come. But the beginning of the questioning and of the conversation is with Isa-bin-Saleh, so that they may think that there is previous knowledge between us and them. And, if Shaikh Bashid and his party come, it is better that a peace be made for otherwise they are ready for battle and the enemies are not many, only two thousand. And now they are distributed between Bidbid and Samail andit is better that they should come prepared for either alternative (either war or peace), but by the road of Sib and should get down in Sib abouUhe evening time. And that they should be disembarked about 3 o clock m the after noon and, immediately on disembarkation they should go forward, lest warning precede them. And evil is not rebutted except by evil like it. And the people of these parts on the arrival of someone from your direction and he in strength will profit you, but there is no profit in letters from a distance, while these'people are besieged and no help is sent to them. And we. anticipated all this trouble from the people of Samail and warned you about it; and now all the people of the Sifala are assisting the Imam in various ways and abuse your poor servant, and letters constantly come to me; sometimes they ask for cartridges and sometimes they demand that I should go with them and some times they demand mv allegiance and sometimes they say that your messengers o-o through me to Saiyid Nadir. They do not leave a single arrow unshot from their quiver, but by God’s grace nothing of all this enters my ears (£.&lt;?., I am not affected by them). And we hope from God that he turn their devices against them and, if they get the mastery, there are plenty of other places by sea and land for me to live in and the rest of the news by the tongue of your servant Ali bin Muhammad. P'S. Yes! and when the aforesaid arrive, let them bring with them special* letters for the Bani Jabir and the Siyabiyin to come with all their Arabs. If you have got profit and peace, well; and if not, then you must fi 2 ht. And the Bani Jabir and the people of Jayla and of Tau in spite of their past actions, perhaps they regret them ; bat the people of Bil and Saija and remainder of their tribes are ready for war. And the better opinion is with you, but conversation and peace-making are of no use without strength and he who looks at the present only does not see anything except the present. And there should also be a letter for them all Ad Dabiyin and Ar Rahbiyan and the Bani Jabir and As Siyabiyan to assist the peace-makers warning them against assisting the Imam, and you know best and this is my opinion, and please tear this letter up after you have read it. Sub-Enclosure No. 2. From—Shaikh Sa’ud-bin-Ali-bin-Jabar-bin-Muhammad-bin-Nasir-al Jabri, inhabitant of the village of Khobar in Wadi Samail of the people of Safala.

To—Shaikhs Muhammad-bin-Mobarak and Sa'id-bin-Salim and Abdullah-bin-Khamis and Salim-bin-Abdullah and JumVbin-Nasir and Muhammad-bin-Khamis and Abdullah-bin-Mobarak, and the whole community of the Jannabah. After compliments .—Your honoured letter reached and your friend has understood its meaning from beginning to end. Know, O ! Shaikhs, if the opinions of the people of the W r adi Samail were with me, there would have been no affair of this kind but they have invented a new opinion of their own and our master Eaisal knows the truth of the matter that I do not control their affairs and how should they see to the opinion of this poor one (himself) and they despise the generosity of the great one who has loaded them with generosity and benefited them and has kept away their enemies. Do not blame me for any trouble that comes from them. And the Shaikh Hamyar, we have informed him and asked of him that he should refrain from hostility and we were unable to prevail with him. He said “ that he had come to an agreement with the Imam and As Salimi and if the Jannabah Shaikhs wanted to make peace, let them address Shaikh Isa first and he was in Bid bid besieging the fort there and with him about 200 men. And let Isa address the Imam and the Salimi. ” But I think that this sedition will not be allayed except by a similar opposition and, while we are in this condition, nothing will be done. And the rebels are less than 2,000 men and none of the people of these parts fight on their side with determination except Sultan (Shaikh Ar Eahibin), and Hamaid (Shaikh An Nadabiyin or Shaikh of W adi alAqq). And it is reported to me that they have returned from Shaikh Isa from Eidbid to gather greater strength from&gt; * These men were killed by the W 7 ali of Nizwah, Saif-biu-Hannnad, about seven year. ago. 3 tlieir tribesmen. And let Saiyid Faisal look to bis affairs and ye also. And good is in the womb of evil. And if these forts remain besieged and are not assisted, there is no doubt that they will fall into their hands. And ■v if the King comes in his strength, facing them with strong troops, to the Wadi Samail, in my opinion, the people of the Wadi Samail will not combine against him, but some will be with him and some against. And when I saw the people of these parts treacherous, I informed His Highness about that and described it to him fully and advised him strongly to bring troops with speed, but the Saiyid thought better and thought is a dream and salaam.

Translation of a letter, dated 5th Shaaban 1331 (10th July 1913), from Shaikh Hamyar-bin- Nasir An-lMabhani to Shaikhs Muhammad-bin-Mobarak, Sahd-bin-Salim, Abdullah-bin- Khamis, Salim-bin-Abdullah, Juma'ah-bin-Nasir, Muhammad-bin-Khamis and Abdullah- bin-Mobarak, and all the Jannabah people. After compliments .—Your esteemd letter to us reached and we understood it. And you are thanked (or it is kind of you). What you mentioned we have known. And that you want us to desist from helping the Imam and all Islam. So, know, O 1 tribe, that we have not the power to stand up for this except with this just Imam. And all the people of Oman have arisen for his help. And you stated that you arrived at Maskat in answer to invitation of the Sultan and that you do not find an excuse from Maskat (can not manage without it) because it is your oath or vow. Then, know, O ! tribe, that we know him who compelled you. First, in the case of the sixteen men whom he beheaded of your community to please the Christians. And four* men in the treasury of the Fort of Nizwah. This is what we know has been quartered on you. And as to ourselves, it is not hidden to you, that our enmity (hostility) has been our aim for ten years, until God has facilitated it this year by the help of this Imam. And my advice to you is that you should follow the Eight and give up the Wrong. And as to what you mentioned that we have an excuse (alternative) from this Government then, know, O l tribe, how can we excuse ourselves when we have made the baTat of (sworn allegiance to) this just Imam. God save us from going astray to Falsehood I To-day messengers arrived here from Sharqiyyah to the effect that they all intend to fight against (attack) Ja’alan and that they want a commander from the Imam and they are ready. But I took pity on you and have delayed that until w r e acquaint you with it. So, if you accept my advice, manage your towns, you as well as the people of Ja’alan. Otherwise, ^ there is no way (blame) on those who do good. And as for what you remarked regarding Maskat that it wall come under the control of the Christians, then, if there w^ere injury, you w'ould be nearest thereto and suffer most therefrom. I And we are, by Grace of God, in freedom from that. Usual ending. Sub-Enclosure No. 4. Translation of a letter, dated 6 th Shaban 1331 (11th July 1913), from Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh Al-Harithi to Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Mubarak, Sahd-bin-Salim, Abdullah-bin-Khamis, ^alim-bin-Abdullah, J uma-bin-Nasir, Mukammad-biu-Khamis and Abdullah-bin- Mobarak, Chiefs of Jannabah. After compliments .—Your esteemed letter reached me and I understood its meaning. .And you mentioned that the Sultan’s invitation came to you and you accepted it, intervening for peace and that you warn the people ef Oman from fighting against the Christians and of what has befallen the Turks. And it is known that that is a fearful matter and it is w lat which has excited the people of Oman to rise up. And as for what has befallen the Muslims at their hands in the inhabited directions (countries), tor the free, death is better than life in that condition. And when the Ummah j(community) departed from the guidance of Al-Koran and changed the usao'e of the Prophet, Muhammad, may peace and blessing of God be on him, and the ways of the good ancestors, then has this befallen the Turks and others. So, we say that the intervention which you make has been made by us ere now but was rejected to us. But we do not remit in our endeavours. The Muslim slave of the Sultan is more beloved to us than a mushrik (politheist). And when your letter reached, I was not present in Samail, so that I might know what there took place, and I do not know what Shaikh Hamyar answered you ■with, for he is the base (or foundation) of the government. (True) goodness is that which is evidenced by enemies. May God put us on the right road and He is enough for us and the best caretaker. Usual ending.

(13th July 1913), from Shaikh S^aud- bin-Ali, al Jabri, to the address of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. Jfter compliments .—As regards my not sending a reply by your servant AH-bin-Muhammad An Nahdi, we informed you about our communication with Hamyar-bin-Nasir and we could not persuade him except that he would go with the majority and finally he answered that, if the people of Ja’alan and Sur wish to intervene, they should first of all address Isa, for he is in Bidbid and that he (Hamyar) is with them as an ally. And, last night, Sultan and Hammad (Shaikhs of Al Wahiba), came and took away the people of Izki and the Bani Rawaha and the following of Isa to Bidbid. Now the total number of those at Bidbid is— The following of Isa The Bani Rawaha and their companions The people of Izki ... 100 men ... 130 „ ... 60 „ uho we i Tlt awa .

Prom a military point of view there are strong objections to proposal that a force of British troops should operate merely for the purpose of keeping open the line of communications between the coast and the Sultan’s troops. In the circumstances if it is eventually decided that military operations are necessary and an advance upon Samail becomes imperative, such action must be under taken by a sufficient force which should operate independently of the Sultan’s troops. We presume that you are satisfied that it is beyond all practical doubt that the insurrection will be terminated without its being necessary to resort to operations inland on a more extensive scale.

Telegram P., No. 116, dated (and received) the 19th July 1918. From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Please refer to Foreign Department telegram No. 250 S. of the 18th instant. The objections of the military authorities are, I think, appreciated by me, and I fully recognised that when it is decided to make an advance on Samail, His Highness the Sultan must be asked to withdraw his troops and stand aside. An advance on Samail, with the sanction of the Sultan, would, I am convinced, bring the rising to a close without recourse to inland operations of an extensive nature. I took His Highness the Sultan into my confidence on the morning of the 17th instant to the extent of intimating that the question was carefully being considered of despatching troops to Sib with the possibility of advancing on Samail and I received an assurance from hijn that their co operation would be welcomed by him. Between Sib and Bidbid the country is reported to be an easy plain. Fiom there yovi move up a valley which never narrows to less than 880 yards. I he enemy would be in possession of a fair supply of ammunition and be well armed with a large proportion of rifles of modern pattern. Their numbers are estimated by the Sultan to be 2,000; hut His Highness’s brother estimates t at their utmost strength might be 10,000 men in the event of their religious fanaticism being aroused. So far the rebels have displayed no enterprise in leir strategetical movements and poor fighting qualities at the siege operations at bamail. 1 ossibly they would display greater determination in the defence °l k 01 * 16 ’ k ut we have no reason to rate their fighting qualities as being of a high order. ° ° ^ Addressed to Sir P. Cox.3 Telegram P., No. 1294, dated (and received) the 19th July 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla (repeated to Political Agent, Maskat). Reference your telegram No. 250 8. The position is, I understand, that the military authorities do not commend the idea of despatching a regiment tn Sib to ensure Sultan a safe base to fall back on if not successfuf and encourage his adherents to advance and that they consider that a force must be sent sufficient to provide for the relief or recapture of Samail by the troons them- selves if they are to be sent at all. 1 In any case the despatch of troops is, in my opinion, now urgently necessary, and action should be taken at once if Knox’s expected wire from Sih reports no change. r , “foT I hat i! onl ? s ^i d N ? dir 0311 hold out until our troops have landed at Sib, the adherents of the rebel leaders will melt away as soon as they hear of this event and that at all events in relieving Saiyid Nadir we should experience little difficulty. If, however, before our men reach Sib Samail should fall, recapture of position will involve more difficulty and the event will in all probability give fresh impetus to the rebellion. It is my opinion, however, that for the security and commercial existence of Maskat the possession of Samail and its two main communications with Matrah is essential and that Samail must be retaken if necessary. I am confident that relief and recovery of Samail will prevent the rebels from taking further action, but it will not necessarily mean that the rebels will restore Nizwa and the other important points which have recently been lost by the Sultan. J The whole situation regarding the future of Oman under the Sultan will I have to be considered with much care and deliberation when the safety of Maskat is assured and Samail is recovered, but that will be a big question, and I consider that our present programme should be confined to the relief of Samail and the possibility of holding it for a short time.From Viceroy, 8th August 1913. foreign Secret. ^ onr telegram of 5th August and oiir recent telegrams repeating reports from Cox on Muscat situation. We fully recognise dangers pointed out by Cox and Knox of the Sultan’s repudiating warehouse arrangement, and of his reverting to his former attitude of past years of unfriendly obstruction, and also further dangers of our being obliged to defend Muscat and Muttra for an indefinite time, and of other Arab chiefs of the Gull littoral declining to assist in suppression of arms traffic from fear of consequences similar to those in Muscat. We recognise moreover, that, in giving the assistance which Sultan requires, we will not only fulfil moral obligation to protect him from consequences of his helpful attitude towards us, but avoid much of above dangers, and further demonstrate in practical manner our special position in Muscat vis a vis other powers. Nevertheless, we adhere to former conviction that intervention in hinterland is fraught with dangers greater than ensuing advantage, and that we should restrict our action to the coast. That action, however, should be as effective as circumstances permit. Our military advisers consider that force now in Muscat and Muttra is only sufficient to hold its own against serious attack, but in order to repulse serious attack with heavy loss to the enemy, it should be reinforced by battalion of native infantry, and be assisted by field guns from llis Majesty’s ships. In this we concur, and propose, with your approval, to despatch a battalion immediately to Muscat.'Vtl &amp; From Viceroy, 3rd Avgust 1913. Foreign Secret. Muscat situation.

The letter also mentioned that the only 2 positions that remained to His Highness were the fort and the Masjid. 219. His Highness states that the next objective of the Imam and his following will be Rustaq. Ahmed bin Ibrahim is between the devil and the deep sea, as he cannot withstand the Imam and is afraid to ask help from his High ness as the result of a successful defence of Rustaq with the help of His High ness would be, he fears, that Rustaq would revert to the Sultan. 220. On the 5th news reached Maskat that the rebels had taken the Fort of Nizwah and thatlthe Wali, Saif bin Hamedh, had shot himself before the rebels entered the fort. He wrote a note to His Highness in which he stated that he died by his own hand. 221. On the night of the 4th His Highness, hearing that some sympathisers of the Imam who had come from Zanzibar were taking arms for the Imam by a sailing boat, despatched Saiyid Taimur in the steam cutter after them.

On the 5th His Highness beared that some fighting had taken place at Khaburah among the Hawasinah and 40 men had been killed.

Knox, C.I.E., Political Agent, Maskat, to Lieutenant- Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.SJ., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 91, dated the 23rd (received 26th) June 1913, with enclosures. I have just time for a short note—as the mail is sighted—to give you the latest news of the Imam’s rising. This morning I asked the Sultan for an interview, but he could not promise me one, as he was expecting Saiyid Taimur on his way back from the bur where he has gone in the “Nur-ul-Bahr” to fetch a contingent of the aalan men. The Saiyid heard that a steamer was seen coming up from the ur an action. It was really a big steamer from Aden but, on seeing the3 smoke, it was reported to him that Saiyid Taimur was returning. When he found out his mistake, he called at Matrah to pick up a messenger from Saivid K adir and came back direct to the Consulate, where he had a long confab with me. He handed over three letters of which I enclose the translations to show you the sort of rubbish that is flying about. The position is as follows Saiyid Nadir is in Ismail and Taimur is expected anytime with the Jaalan contingent, of whom some may stay here and the rest will move up, possibly with Taimur himself, to Bidbid, whence the relief party for Awabi is to start. Saiyid Faisal tells me that he fears Awabi too will fall, as it is only held bv some 15 men of Hadhramaut. The relief party should have started long ago, hut they are treacherous and causing interminable delays to Saiyid Hamad,* who is in command. I made a suggestion to the Saiyid that, if *he liked, I would ask the Senior Naval Officer if it would be possible to transfer the “ Odin ** and the two launches on the Mekran coast to the Batineh coast. He replied that if I was alarmed for the safety of my nationals there would be no objection, but he saw no necessity for it. I replied what I wanted to do was to act in concert with him throughout. I asked him what the chances were of a sudden raid on Maskat or Matrah and he said that it was practically impos sible. I asked how much warning we should have of an attack and suggested seven days. He said, he would have more than that. Of course British sub- jects are greatly alarmed, but I hope • u.jc, Murph, * tamug b, th , 8 ^ and think His Highness well knows what he is about. I wonder if Murphy* is very busy up there with you in Bushire. If not, I think it would be no bad thing to have him down here for a week or two. It might be useful to have a staff officer here in case there was any question of sending troops here, as it is just as well to be prepared even for the most unlikely contingencies. Here is the mail just anchored, so I must stop. Sub-Enclosure No. 1 to Enclosure No. 5. (Covjidential.) Translation of a letter from Isa bin Saleh al Harithi to Shaikh Rashid bin Azayiz bin Bakhayyat al Khasaibi, dated the 12th Rajab i331 Hijra (18th June 1913). After compliments .—We are well and thanks be to God in good health l May you never cease to be likewise and here is no news but good news and praise be to God alone. And we had arranged the 15th of the present month as a fortunate day for proceeding to the presence of the Imam, after letters and messengers had constantly come inviting us to go to him. And we did not see any escape from answering to one who calls in God’s name and have made preparation to go to him with the blessing of God and to help him. And a letter has already gone from us to you and no reply came. So we followed it on with this letter. And see 1 Oh Aba Bashid (i.e., wise old man) this wonderful strange affair, how the Shaikhs of Thahirah and the Shaikhs of Oman are serving this Imam without hope of gain and the grace is to God and the forts are calling out “ Come ! Come ! ” . And this is due to the wonderful works which they have witnessed and there is to God a hidden secret among His worshippers—a man of the ordinary people knowing nothing but piety and him the cities of the East and West serve ! There is no God but God ! Oh our God l No one can raise whom Thou hast put down, nor can any put down whom Thou hast put up 1 And when the great God has made the people obedient to a fortunate one, then they too are fortunate. May God disappoint the Christians! May their conspiracy be dispersed and their j knavish devices returned into their throats ! For certainly they were the cause of a cleavage between the King and his subjects. And first and last the event is with God and we are what we formally were and greeting! Written at his dictation by his servant S’aud bin Hamaid with his own hand on the 15th Bajab 1331 Hijra. p. S .—Your letter written on the last day of Jamadi ath Thani has reached me after the writing of the letter and I have understood it. And what was feared about the people has been dispelled (i.e., that they would1 4 not follow the Imam) and opinions are changed and this is because of the wonderful works they have seen. And your not replying when Rashid returned is not due to the cause you mention but because of the angry eye (i.e., of the Sultan) and do not forget Ibn Arfah and his affair, and we are ^ as we Were and God sees all and greeting. v) Isa wrote with his own hand.

May God help him I And I heard about vour honour, that you are staying in Samail. And we are indebted to you for kindness which we do not forget, had it not been what the Shara' makes it incumbent on us—obedience to religion. But we are the first of those who joined as a deputation (body). And it only remained to fulfil the (duty of) advice to you as a matter of consideration or regard. So, when this my letter reaches you, look out for yourself a way to get out from there ; because all who are around you are against you. Really they are beguiling you to take your money from you. Escape ! again, escape ! And I swear before God that this is the clear outspoken advice and I am sincere, although you may think that I am a fighting foe. So, whoever persuades you other than this, is deceiv ing you. And I do not add more warning to you and salaam. (Signature and date.) P. S .—Excuse please ! paper and covers befitting your honour were not available. Note by Saiyid Nadir. Yes. We were given to understand last night that a letter had been sent for us some days since and nobody was bold enough to bring it to us. So to-day, in the morning, this reached us and it is from the Shaikh. Erom the time it was written to the date of its receipt, five days have elapsed. Salaam. Bated 15th Rajah 1331 (21st June 1913).

Afte* compliments .—There is nothing in this your country that would necessitate communication except the arrival of a messenger from the Imam, and before this other messengers came insisting on our going to him. Last night I read his letter and therein he pressed me, and God says Listen to the inviter of God”! So we have determined to obey him, like Muslims, so that we may be of those who are saved. And the intention is to go on the 15th day of this our month with a handful of men. And this is the third letter and no reply came from you without any cause or reason. Your letters to the Shaikhs of the country were shown to us. But this is not the day (time) for them. So, do not turn your attention to them. But if you needs must do so and there is no alternative, then for an emergency of this kind, there are the ’Al-i-Tamam (the tribe of Bani Bu All). But I understand that they have sought the help of the ’Al-i-Shams (the tribe of Bani Bu Hasan) and ask that they may be left in their own religion (Sunni). And what has happened, 0 King, is a matter which is supernatural: the tribes from the east to the west of the country are drawn (to him) while the Imam is to5 Nizwah. And there was nothing except his real piety and the exhibition of miracles which, we do not think, will lead to what jou hear and ee God knows best where he sends his message.

Please give His Highness my sympathies and say I am anxiously watching your news from week to week and keeping Government of India informed, and. that if there is likelihood of His Majesty's ships beb- needed to support his authority, or look after British communities, it is important that as much notice as possible be given as ordinarily at this season number of ships in Gulf is reduced to minimum.Telegram, No. 1210, dated the 6th (received 7th) July 1913.

Urgent. Situation at Maskat. Please refer to Knox’s telegram No. 98. Numerical strength of Rajputs at Pus hi re is roughly four hundred men exclu sive of Residency guard(s), guard(s) at private houses and guard(s) at Kharag island. While effect of recent operations on Tangistan coast has undoubtedly been excellent, a great deal of irritation has naturally arisen, and in the event of any wholesale reduction in number of troops at Bushire at present juncture it is conceivable that we might appear to invite a repetition of raid of the year 1909 when Tangistanis were able to advance with some thousand men on Bushire. There are no troops at Governor’s disposal, and he depends on British force here to maintain peace and quietness. Considering the circumstances and having consulted Officer Commanding troops here, I doubt whether it would be desirable on part of Government of India to despatch to Maskat more than two hundred and fifty troops. Exclusive of guards this will leave strength of force at Bushire at one hundred and forty-three men with three machine guns which number could be reinforced by fifty troops with one machine gun from Kharag island leaving a guard of twenty men at latter place. Troops are prepared to embark on receipt of orders from Government, and meanwhile I will make every endeavour for mail steamer to be detained.Telegram P., No. 226 S., dated the 7th July 1913.

Please inform me whether I am authorised to acquaint His Highness with the purport of tele gram referred to. I am certain Sultan would immediately ask for landing of troops at Muttra and institution of necessary precautions in order to protect both Maskat and Muttra, but unless Sultan realises the position he will not do anything until the Imam is actually knocking at his gates and then His Highness will ask with some asperity what our men were supposed to be doing at the time. I would strongly impress upon you that I should be permitted to approach His Highness on the subject as I am of opinion that actual landing of troops would have the effect of immediately reassunling His Highness and in all probability would incidentally result in relieving Saiyid Nadir whose situation is a critical one and causes grave anxiety to the Sultan. I would insist on His Highness providing me with express request in writing to land troops in his territory. Ends.s» Telegram, No. 1221, dated (and received) the 9th July 1913.

Letter has been received from Shaikh Saudabjabri and lias been sent to me by Syad Muhammad. He reports that mine in Samail was tired at daybreak ! 9th July and it blew up the well- tower and the privy which 1 understand are in south corner. Screen wall has, however, been constructed by Syad Nadir during the siege and this apparently holds, though interior of fort is now exposed to fire from the high ground opposite south face. There is still a well which can be approached by night time for the need of garrison. It is now suggested that rebels will try another mine, and that after this catastrophe Syad Nadii cannot possibly hold out fortnight. In my ‘ Philomel ’ telegram I mentioned proposed occupation of Wadi Aththabaun, and now another lettei has been received from Banijabar saying Isa Bin Saleh has forestalled them. Ihis points to treachery on the part of Banijabar and to understatement of Isas forces. Nadir also in a recent letter complains that many of his followers rilles are out of order. Sheikh lleshid Bin Azzaiyiz brought me this news and letters, he states he and Syad Cimur had endless discussion with Bani-bu-ali persuading them to Sib and he despairs of situation except with the aid of British Government.”IFrom Viceroy, 22nd July ]913. f r■ 7 ; T 1 , V 1 , 0 1 at was critical, on- Cox recommends r i'° 1( u sh ° U ( b ? landed at Sib with object of marching to Samail to his ic ml.

He asked for three days’ delay before stating definitely whether he required more help, but he hopes from reports from Samail valley to settle matters himself. I made it clear I was ,)y no means sure that troops would be sent whether he wished it or not. I could only tell him despatch was being considered. Sultan seemed very confident and content and said that if he did not ask for help in three davs r Tu 01 '!! n0t a i Sk a T a ' , He seems convm ced that situation has changed for the better, but I am doubtful.” /H E Q e !

Last night the Nooralbahar arrived ( ? ) another contingent of Lam-umar and iNam-ed-dowlehi, 250 men, and was immediately ordered back to Sib. A verbal report by a messenger is to the effect that 60 horse men of the Bani-yas from the trucial coast have arrived at Sib and that force now with Taimur and Sultan, exclusive of possible sympathisers in \\ adi Samail, is estimated at about a thousand men.” We are of opinion that expedition to Sib and Samail is out of the question. If position of garrison at Samail critical, force would arrive too late foi its lelief. W hile if it arrived in time to relieve garrison, place would be occupied by rebels as soon as expedition retired. In view of undesirability of active interference in internal politics of Maskat we consider that our action should be confined to securing; safety of Maskat and Matrah, and of such places on coast as can be protected by His Majesty’s ships. V\ e cannot assume responsibility, for safety of Sultan’s sons in hinterland, where His Highness must manage his own affairs. Our protection of his capital gives him a secure basis and enables him to withdraw his troops for action elsewhere.y —f From Viceroy, nth July 1913. leaders of the movement and see what openings there are for coming to an arrangement with them on behalf of the Sultan. Sheikh Rashid’s secretary would accoinpany me and would probably be dispatched under flag of truce to sa-bin-Saleh to learn his intentions and chances of understanding. I would not commit Sultan nor Government without fully consulting them both. If, as seems likely, Chiefs decline interview and the rebellion is weakening I shall consider with Hamid and the Secretary advisability of immediate advance on Bidbid by the Bani-bu-Ali where it appears Sultan’s fort still holds out and Isa has only 140 men. Immediate object of this is relief of Syed Nadir who as late as 9th July wrote to his father cheerfully that he was holding out well and had inflicted heavy loss on the besiegers. [Murphy ?] would accompany me to Sib, and we would not proceed beyond that village without permission, and would sleep on “ Philomel.” I shall be in wireless touch all the time within three hours of Maskat.” No. 105, 1 Jth July. “ In continuation of my telegram of 11th July, No. 104. I had a long interview with Sultan, Syed Muhammad, and Sheikh Rashid yesterday morning. Bani-bu-Ali are unwilling to move, and though they may be induced to go to Sib, they will not get any further unless the condition of affairs proves very favourable, which is unlikely. All the three are convinced that if Smail Bidbid falls—and the utmost limit of Smail Bidbid standing is placed at month—we shall be laced with a formidable rising. At present Maskat and Muttra are perfectly safe and a determined force moving on Smail Bidbid, would, so the three say, disperse rising finally. Unfortunately, Sultan seems to have nothing to rely on, but he says landing of a British force, prepared in the event of it being found necessary to move on Smail Bidbid at Sib, would open way for himself and his sympathisers to occupy Smail Bidbid when the confederacy would melt away, and the Ghafiris return to their allegiance. While fully recognising many objections to such a strong move, I think it appears the only alternative to an inter minable occupation of Maskat and Muttra, and I therefore put it forward as saving time and expense in the long run, and affording only possible means of return to status quo ante. His Highness’s written request goes without saying. Probable estimate of force required for the move on Smail Bidbid would be battalion of Native Infantry, in addition to present native troops and two sections of Mountain Battery.” No. 106, 13th July. “ His Highness told me finally this afternoon that the Bani-bu-Ali will not move, and he added some scathing remarks withr FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS.

Secondly, subject to further observations by Political Agent, I think latter’s com munications with rebel leaders had better be limited, to begin with, to a repetition of warning of 1895 and intimation that any molestation of British subjects or their property will bring them into conflict with us. Any question of coming to an arrangement, especially if that means buying them off, had better be left to the Sultan s envoy, Political Agent advising him as opportunity may offer, and if necessary, witnessing ultimate agreement made. For the rest, I support Political Agent’s proposals. Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Muscat.” No. 1257, 18th July. “ Reference to Muscat, telegram No. 105. Having- regard to fact that the Sultan s co-operation with us in the suppression of arms traffic is the partial if not the sole reason of this rising, we are in honour bound to give our staunch support (to) klis Highness and his son. I agree with Knox that to act vigorously now will probably save us much trouble and expense a short time hence, and as the reality and critical nature of Sultan’s position is beyond question, it shall (sic) not be difficult to get French Gfovernment to appreciate it and concur at the same time (in) action. Sib is an excellent place, with plenty of shady gardens, for making a base, and there is every reason to believe that if we landed a small force there ready to advance on Semail if ultimately necessary, the necessity for advance would not arise. Strength mentioned by Knox would seem to be sufficient if we were only required to keep open communication bet ween Sultan’s force and coast, but if we were called on to advance upon Semail ourselves 1 am of opinion that two regiments on field service strength should be sent; one for maintenance of line of communication and other for advance with two sections of Mountain Battery.

There are additional reasons for using same policy at this juncture in that the Sultan attributes, probably with justice, the rising against him largely to unpopularity caused by his identifying himself with British Government in suppression of arms traffic. In the circumstances it seems impossible not to support Sultan, confining our action- in this respect strictly to defence of towns mentioned.

Extract from Maskat Agency Diary No. 21-486 for the -week ending 24 th May 19 / 3 . Several reports have been received by His Highness the Sultan during the week from Rustaq, Naz vah and other places to the effect that what may prove to be a powerful rising is forming in those quarters under the ring-leadership of the Chief Abadhi Shaikh, Abdulla bin Hamed as Salimi, who, himself an old and almost blind man, wishes to proclaim a religious war against the Sultan with the object of setting up his son-in-law Salim bin Rashid as Imam of Oman, the cause being the supposed leaning of the Sultan to Foreign Governments and institutions. This faction comprises the tribes of Bani Riyam Ibriyin and the Bani Hina tribes of Jabal-Riyam and Wadi-al-Maawal; the troubles originated at the village of Tanuf, near Nazwah, and it is supposed that the rebels might come down on Nazwah and Rustaq as both of these places are said to be insufficiently garrisoned by His Highness the Sultan’s askaris. His Highness the Sultan seems perturbed at these manifestations and is taking steps to strengthen his garrisons at Nazwah and Rustaq with men and provisions, but it is feared that he may be unable to do so, as it is believed that the communications are in the enemies’ hands. Letters received subsequently and transmitted by His Highness to the Political Agent show that the ring-leader is already calling himself the Imam of the Muslims and has been trying to persuade the Chiefs of the Bani Ruwaha and other smaller neighbouring tribes to join his cause.

I communicated to His Highness the decision of Government, that having regard to the important British interests at stake in Maskat and Mattrah, no attacks upon these towns would in future be permitted whatever differences might arise between the Sheikhs of Oman and their Ruler. 2. This intimation was not received by the Sultan with the cordial satis faction that I had expected, and I was somewhat surprised to observe that His Highness seemed to regard the policy which I had been directed to announce to him, as a matter of course. Having regard to the fact that whatever the reasons determining this policy, it is evidently of supreme import ance to him in practically giving to his position and authority the most valuable support of which the circumstances admit, I am at a loss to explain the spirit in which the Sultan appeared to receive the announcement of it. To my further suggestion, in accordance with what I understood to be the views of Government, that occasion should be afforded me to make the communica tion in a more publiclv formal manner, in view to its general appreciation, and especially of its unreserved acceptance by the Sheikhs principally concerned, His Highness replied that none of the important Sheikhs, or those especially contemplated being present in Maskat, the necessary arrangements could not at once be made. It was accordingly understood that when certain of the tribal representatives could be assembled, the Political Agent should have an opportunity of repeating the announcement which has already been made to the Sultan.2 3. A number of the principal Hindu traders who presented themselves for an interview with me, expressed lively satisfaction at the present policy of Government, which affords them so valuable an assurance of future immunity from the perils and losses to which they were recently exposed.

The first, which involves the annexation of Muscat and Mattrah, and the pensioning of the Sultan, is not advocated by the local officers, and need not be discussed. 3. With regard to the second proposal—the establishment of an exclusive British Protectorate—the Government of India say that they adhere to the views expressed hy Lord Lansdowne’s Government; but they recognise that France would almost certainly object to the establish ment of a British Protectorate over Oman, and might demand for the abrogation of the Anglo-French Declaration of the 10th March 1862 a price which would be more than the Protectorate is worth.

The Government of India consider this course the more desirable, because, as long as they maintain a policy of strict non-intervention, disturbances are likely to recur ; and, unless we take steps to define our position, there is risk of our becoming involved, however involuntarily, in discussions not only with the Sultan and the tribes, but also with France. 6.

HAMILTON, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 9th July 1895. My Lord, Our Secret Despatch No. 129 (External), dated the 2nd July 1895, transmitted papers giving a detailed account of the recent rebellion against the Sultan of Maskat. We have No. 40 . dated the 4 th May 1895 (Confidential), and nOW tllC honour to forward, for the enclosure - information of Her Majesty’s Government, a copy of the letter cited in the margin, discussing the present situation in Oman, and the considerations by which the future policy of the Go\ernment of India should be guided. 2. The Sultan’s authority is limited, future troubles are anticipated, and the protection of our important interests in the coast towns of Maskat and Mattrah cannot safely be left to his unaided efforts. The Resident and Political Agent suggest that three plans may be open in order to guaid against consequent risks ; either to annex Maskat and Mattrah, and pension the Sultan ; to declare a Protectorate over Oman, or to intimate to the leading Sheikhs of Oman that, whatever differences they may have with their Sultan, the Go\ em inent of India will not permit attacks on Maskat and Mattrah. 3. The first course is only suggested as one possible solution of the difficulty; it is not advocated by the local officers, and we do not propose to discuss it. 4. In 1890, Lord Lansdowne’s Government considered that, on general , ,, Grounds there were good ^ reasons for * Secret Despatch No. 113, External, dated the S’ sth September 1890. asserting a virtual Protectorate over Masqat, but held that, whilst neither France nor any other Power could, with justice, deny that Maskat falls legitimately within the sphere of British influence, the Anglo-French Declaration of the 10th March 1862 would prec u e Great Britain from assuming an exclusive Protectorate without is comm., to an understanding with Prance. Hei oLSST DCSpatC ‘‘ N °’ 39 ' da ‘ edtl,e24tb Majesty’s Governmentf did not consider it practicable to move in the matter at the moment, but Lord S^buiy pro mised to bear in mind the views of the Government of India. Meadhe the views expressed by Lord Lansdowne’s Government; but we recognise[ 2 ] France would almost certainly object to the establishment of a British Protec torate over Oman, and might demand for the abrogation of the Declaration a price which would be more than the Protectorate is worth. We do not therefore anticipate that Her Majesty’s Government will think it prudent to open negotiations on the subject with France at the present juncture. 5. In view, however, of past events in Oman and of the Sultan’s slight authority over the tribes, we are of opinion that it is at any rate necessary to adopt some such course as that suggested in paragraph 17 of Major Sadler’s report, in order to safeguard the lives and property of our Indian subjects resident in Mask at and Mattrah, and British Indian trade with those places, from the dangers which a renewal of disorder would entail. This is the more desirable because, as long as we maintain a policy of strict non-intervention, disturbances are likely to recur; and, unless we take steps to define our position, there is risk of our becoming involved, however involuntarily, in discussions not only with the Sultan and the tribes, but also with France. The French show an inclination to take a renewed interest in the affairs of the Persian Gulf ; they have lately appointed a Vice-Consul to Maskat, and one of their 1 cruisers was sent there in connection with the recent rebellion. 6. We propose to instruct our Political Besident in the Persian Gulf to intimate to the leading Sheikhs in Oman that, in consideration of our important inteiests in Maskat and Mattrah, we will not permit any attack on those towns. This position would be assumed solely for the protection of our existing commercial interests, and need not, we think, be objected to as constituting a practical step in advance towards a Protectorate in effect, though not in name; such a icsult would however be to our advantage. The course indicated is, in * despatch No. 36 (External), dated the fact, a modification of the policy of Lord 16 th February 1886. t\ • 1 J Dufferin’s* Government which, directly duiing the reign of Seyyid Turki, and indirectly during the reign of the present Sultan, gave Oman, until recently, a period of rest from internal dissensions which is probably without a parallel in the history of the country.

Enclosure of a letter to Eer Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, No. 133, dated the 9th July 1895.1 No. 40, dated Bushire, the 4th May 1895 (Confidential). From— Colonel F. A. Wilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of correspondence ending with my letter No. 22 of the 13th April, I have the honour to forward a letter No. 86 of the 10th April, from the Political Agent at Muscat, discussing the situation as left by the recent revolt against the Sultan with its accompanying state of war, and the results to which it may lead; and submitting certain considerations on the course to be adopted, in order to the security of our interests in the future. 2. Major Sadler, after clearly describing the topographical distribution of the tribes, shows that the Sultan’s power is very limited in extent, and that the attempt to strengthen and extend it by a system of money pay ments has been utterly useless, resulting only in impoverishment. Still Seyyid Feysul’s position, though weak, need not be regarded as altogether hopeless, and the support he lately received from a large body of his people might be turned to good account. Though loyal however, he is described as having shown himself obstinate in regard to advice, and notwithstanding the rude awakening he has had, a radical improvement in his control of affairs cannot confidently be looked for. In any case, Major Sadler considers that we cannot rely upon the Sultan alone for the protection of our very important interests in the towns of Muscat and Mutrah, in which the wealth, commerce, and property are principally in the hands of British Indian subjects. In this view I am disposed to concur, as also in the further opinion that our recent strict neutrality having dissipated any idea that might have existed among the tribes, that our support would be given to the existing authority, further troubles are by no means unlikely. 3. To guard against the risks of this critical position it is proposed— (1) to annex Muscat and Mutrah, which would practically involve an extinction of the Sultanate, for no reasonably stable base for it, in the disturbed interior, would be possible; (2) to declare a protectorate over Oman. Either of these measures would he of grave moment, and would require a preliminary withdrawal from our convention of 1862 with France, and I feel some hesitation in expressing my opinion upon them. After careful consider ation, however, I am disposed to favour the second proposal as promising to be less onerous and embarrassing than the other, and equally efficient to secure the object aimed at—protection for the valuable interests which we have at stake. 4. I agree with Major Sadler in the belief that a protectorate would be welcomed by the people generally, and probably also by the Chief, who could hardly fail to see in the support which he could secure, by conforming to our advice, a means to the increased stability of his rule. In the existing local and political conditions, there seem also to be several which would be very favourable to such a measure. Interference m the affairs of the interior would be quite unnecessary and could easily be avoided, the tribal life of the Arabs, with its incessant unrest, being matters which not affect the important interests at the ports. Even here, the influence of the Sultan, more judiciously exerted under our advice, should occasion to offer t arise, would doubtless have a valuable effect in allaying inter-tribal diffi culties, and a gradual amelioration of the constant strife, which has foi ages been the normal state, would follow. # . . Muscat and Mutrah are practically independent of the ^tenor wbm , m its turn, depends on these ports for most of the necessaries of for the export of its produce in exchange for f? e f Ce :' an '/j would at the would thus^for all practical purposes, command the interior, and would asame time be easily secured against any aggression from it. The volume of their trade is very considerable, and may be taken as the measure of the in fluence for good, which the authority controlling it could bring to bear on the peoples inland. And a most favourable circumstance of the situation is ^ that the external relations of Oman being for all practical purposes confined to British India, and in much minor degree, Zanzibar, no complications from a collision with Foreign interests would be likely to arise. 5. Should wider consideration of Imperial policy be opposed to the entertainment of the views above discussed, some such safeguards against the risks to which our important interests in property and commerce are exposed, as are sketched in the concluding portion of Major Sadler’s letter, would seem to demand the attention of Government. No. 86, dated Muscat, the 10th April 1895 (Confidential). From —Major J. Hayes Sadler, Political Agent, Muscat, To —Colonel F. A. Wilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In your letter marginally noted you reported to Government on the pro- Paras. 8-ii of letter No. c., dated the 2ist March, bable result, so far as it could be foreseen from the Political Resident to the Koreigu Secretary. 0 f the recent rebellion as affecting the authority of the Sultan and the prestige of his powerful adversary, Sheikh Salih. I now venture to make a few observations on the political situation in Oman and the considerations which would guide us, should it be in contempla tion to effect a change in our policy towards the country and its ruler. And I would preface these remarks by respectfully expressing my entire concur rence in the views you have expressed in the paragraphs above noted. 2. For present purposes Oman may be divided into three portions :— {a) The Sharkiyyeh and Jaalan. (6) The Dhahirah and the Batinah. (c) The Hajoor and Oman Proper. ./?) 1° } he Sharkiyyeh, which is mainly peopled by Binawi tribes, r the J (lomraailt spirit, held in check in a manner by the Ghafiris ot that district and Jaalan. In Jaalan the power is pretty evenly balanced between the rival Hmawi and Ghafiri tribes, the Chief of which, the Beni Boo assan (II) and the Beni Boo Ali (Gh) are constantly at war with each other, ihe Sultan has no voice in the affairs of the Sharkiyyeh or Jaalan. (S) The principal tribe in the Dhahirah is the Naim (Gh), which is under e in uence o . and held in check by, the Chief of Aboo Dhabi, who is on influence tl TM Su ^ ail v .^ man * f ar as Oman politics are concerned, this and the other Dhahirah tribes may be said to be independent. ftipnr^f 0111 ^ as:Daa h the Batinah the Sultan exercises autboritv; ^ n° b i ar, i ll h( \ . 1Tlland tribes are under the influence of Seyyid in th* nnsc ^ • ai % fL ^ bls °^ d a ^i es J the Yal Saad, the coast towns being m the possession of the Sultan. tbP P ° rtl ? n of . the ^ a i 00 . r whi cb comprises Semmayil, Nakl, Tao and the control nPfh ’ wblcb ^ peopled by Ghafiris, is more or less under UzairPwPfi the n* SU f n ’ Wh -° has an able official, Sheikh Rashid bin Uzaiz, to look after his interests in that quarter. Bailah^fru p enC f e Proper is divided between the Ghafiris of Hinawis of i W ° m ^ ■ Parrd * ab the Ghafiri clans, and tlie authority. f N ZWah; ° Ver neitber of ^ese does the Sultan exercise any that nortL W iP t i hUS Tp- See l n l that the Sultan,s direct authority is limited to that portion of the Batinah between Muscat and Masnaah and its coast towns, 2and is exercised in a measure over the tract of country round Nakl Tao the Wadi Muawal and Semmayil. The latter is important, as from this valley lead the passes into the Sharkiyyeh and Oman Proper. J Even here the Sultan has lost ground, his policy of non-interference having alienated some of the Ghafiri tribes and brought them more within the influence of Sheikh Salih; last autumn they were dissatisfied at their disputes being referred for settlement to that Sheikh, and it may be owing to this unfortunate policy of the Sultan’s that we find Sheikhs of the Rahbiyeen and Nidabiyeen, the two Ghafiri tribes holding the principal passes, in co-oper ation with Sheikh Salih in his attack on the Sultan. 4. It is not necessary for me to repeat history and recapitulate the causes which led to the power and control exercised over the tribes of Oman by Seyyid Saeed and his son Seyyid Thoweyni passing from the hands of their successors, till we come to the position sketched in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this report. Suffice it to say that the situation now is not so bad as it was in the worst days of Seyyid Turki. The Sultan has not taken advantage of the unusually peaceful state in which he found the country on his accession to consolidate his power, his rule has been weak, and he has tried to avert the hostility of some of the tribes and enlist the good-will of others by a system of cash payments, which would break a far longer purse than his without producing any permanent result. The Arab is only to be controlled by two agents —force and money—the Sultan unable to employ the former had recourse to the latter, and the more lie gave the more was asked. The uselessness of this system of what passes for Government in Arabia was fully shown in the time of the late Sultan Seyyid Turki, whose liberal donations to the tribes exhausted his resources, but failed to secure their fidelity. 5. The Sultan’s position, however, weak as it has been shown to be, is not altogether hopeless. Large reinforcements mustered to his assistance in his hour of need, and though they may have answered the Sultan’s summons more with a view to thwart their Hicawi rivals than to actively support their ruler, yet the passive resistance they offered was quite enough to show Sheikh Salih that the object of the rebellion could not be attained, it forced the rebels to come to terms and unquestionably saved the Sultanate. This, as you have remarked, is a force which, if judiciously used, might be turned to great advantage. There are also dissensions amongst the Hinawis, of which the Sultan is well aware, and of which I am advised he will not be slow to take advantage. I may mention two instances:— (a) The jealousy between Sheikh Salih and Sheikh Saeed bin Ali. One of the causes of disagreement between the Sultan and Sheikh Salih was the favour shown by His Highness to Sheikh Saeed, Sheikh Salih right y or ^ thinking the Sultan was trying to subvert his influence with the Hart through this Sheikh. (b) The ill-feeling which the Hijriyeen bear towards the Earth on account of the larger presents received by the latter from the Su tan o anzi ar, which the former attribute to the influence of the Earth and more especia v of Hilal bin Aamir with Seyyid Hamad bin Tnovveym, e ac ? the Hijriyeen Sheikhs arrived at Zanzibar after the Sultan had received a caution in the matter of these presents. Moreover the Hijriyeen show a tendency to revert to the Ghafiri ac ion to which they originally belonged. &lt; . There is also the fact that Sheikh Salih must to a certain extent ^be ^is- credited by the very treacherous and underhand mannei ^ attempt on the Sultanate was made; and also m a manner by ^01 that tlie rebellion failed to gain its declared object, t &lt;lU ^ ..nonecessful attempts it must be observed that Sheikh Salih has made many unsuccessful attempts on Muscat without losing much of his prestige t ere y.I 6. Weak ruler though Seyyid Turki was, he threw in his lot entirely with us, he relied implicitly on the British Government, and in his allegiance to it he never wavered; and it is to the support afforded him in recognition of these friendly and loyal feelings that he owed in a great measure the main tenance of his position and his throne. 7. I fear quite the same cannot be said of the present Sultan. His loyalty has never been questioned, but since the early days of his rule he has shown a disinclination to regard advice tendered him in an amicable spirit from this Agency by my predecessors and myself in the same light of con fidence as his lateiather, whilst his attitude in connection with several matters affecting British interests has been neither reasonable nor altogether friendly. 8. This may partly be attributed to ignorance, and a tendency in his disposition to pride and self-conceit which leads him to take bis own line regardless of the opinion of those who are willing and able to give him good advice. The fact too may be borne in mind of the easy circumstances under which he succeeded to the Sultanate, and the absence during his reign until lately of those troubles, which were so marked a feature of Saiyid Turki’s life, an ex perience of which might perhaps have taught him the necessity of better appreciating our friendship and assistance. 9. I have long thought that some lesson was needed, and this has come in the most sudden and violent form. He has seen his capital occupied bv his enemies and our assistance, freely given to his father, though under somewhat different circumstances, withheld. Whether late events will have effected a permanent change in the Sultan’s attitude it is too early yet to say; I can only express my hopes that it may be so, and add that I have noticed favourable indications of a desire to draw closer to us. 10. But the fact which I wish to bring prominently to the notice of Government is that, be the character and attitude of the Sultan what they may, the political conditions are neither now, nor are likely to be in the near future, such as to warrant our depending on the unaided efforts of the Sultan for the protection of our interests in the towns of Mutrah and Muscat. ai* . ine ^ n ^ Gur subjects are to remain in these 1am towns and carry on their business with security to their persons and property, and if we are to preserve the local trade with India, a policy of neutrality on the next these'objects ^ Sultan ’ S authorit y wil1 probably fail to secure w , 11 - Iha ^ ealread 7 observed that it was mainly to the active support afforded by us to Seyyid Turki that he was able to retain his position and his throne, and 1 consider it to be mainly owing to the belief of the tribes that this support would be continued to his son that Seyyid Feysul owes until his^eign 3108 unm * erru f ) ^ ed immun ity from attack since the commencement of i . sa f e gu ar d exists no longer. Our attitude of inaction ^ 0n f d c er f l tl0ns a P a rt, was forced on us from the outset of the rflhpls ° ^ 0wn at once into the possession of the i Ca -n gave them a free hand in their attempt to seize the fnt nH a* 1 f wl . f encou r a ge them to take the same view of the situation in em r lfab “S from coerci011 has not led them to think we were tacitly on their side. yet , surmi f e wl ' at 1 tlle aftereffects of the rebellion will be, not hpfnro ;t ma ^ . an ^ lt ' I P a f ;e( i that, under present conditions, Oman has next fpw ° res ^» ln deed it would not be safe to predict that the takes nlaop nc § W1 f -i )aSS W1 ^ 10u f fnrther trouble. And when another rising of tL P inpbw!°T \ lme °i °A h ?l ^ Will » we caimot a ff°rd to have a repetition ol the incidents which marked the late rebellion 4 4Experience has shown that the Bedouin cannot he restrained for Ions from pillage and plunder and once inside the walls there is almost as much to fear fiom friend as foe, the Sultan is unable to control his allies the rebel leaders their followers, the chief object of an Arab war being to make off with as much plunder as each side can secure. 13. The remedy for this unsatisfactory state of affairs would, I submit, he found in a change of our policy towards the country. If the present be thought a fitting opportunity for withdrawing from the Convention of 1862 with France, two courses would be open^ (a) To annex Muscat and Mutrah and pension the Sultan. This is such a radical measure that perhaps it need not be seriously considered in this lettei. Hie result to us would be that we should gain a naval position which we practically command already, but with this advantage that ne should be able to put it in a proper state of defence, secure the harbour and anchorage and command the trade of the country; in fact create a Persian Gulf Aden. To the Sultan it would mean the loss of the Sultanate, for, without the walls and forts of Muscat, he could not rule Oman for a single day. The country would fall into two divisions—one ruled by Seyyid Ibrahim bin Kais from Kustak, the other by Sheikh Salih from Sammed, the intervening tribes falling under the influence of one or other of these Chiefs. (b) To declare a British protectorate over Oman. I trust it may not be considered presumption on my part if I express the opinion that the time is drawing near when we may have to take some step in this direction or the march of events will force it on us. The advance of Russia, the interest taken by that Power and by France in the Persian Gulf, where they have no commercial responsibilities, the gradual extension of Turkish influence over the Arabian peninsular, and the future political conditions of Persia, are all questions in connection with which our future position in the Gulf will have to be determined. The hold which a protectorate would give us over Oman and its important harbour and coaling station at Muscat, which could easily be rendered impregnable, would materially strengthen that posi tion. Any question of the extension of French influence at Soor or of interfer ence in the politics of Oman would at once be set at rest, and a more effective barrier would be pbiced in the way of Turkish designs on the country, when a more general movement of that nation towards Arabia takes place. 14. In the country itself I believe that a British protectorate would be welcomed by the people, both Hinawis and Ghafiris alike, with the exception perhaps of the maritime tribes of Soor, who still continue to traffic in slaves; the people are well disposed towards us, they know our power, and would be glad of the rest which a final appeal to an authority whose decision they would not question would give the country. On all sides since the rebellion from the Sultan downwards in Muscat have I heard the same expression of opinion—it behoves the British Govern ment to look into affairs—which can only be interpreted as a desire to see closer relations established between us and Oman, whilst there is a vague feeling abroad that, unless the British Government takes some definite action,, the Sultan will not be able to hold his own, and security wall not be perma nently established in Mutrah and Muscat, where our interests chiefly lay. 15. A protectorate need not necessarily imply an unqualified support of the reigning Sultan against the declared voice of the people, which I may say it would be very difficult to ascertain in view of the rivalry existing between the Ghafiri and Hinawi factions; but given that with our support the Sultan ruled moderately well—and Ins rule has never inclined to undue severity—he would look on that support as the certain means of his retaining the Sultanate, whilst it would effectually check the designs of ambitious Chiefs like Sheikh Salih bin Ali. We need not interfere in internal affairs more than we may 5consider it necessary to do, though I believe that such is the power of our name in Oman that the exercise of a little tact on the part of a British officer would go far to settle many of the inter-tribal disputes which ordinarily occur. 16. Should the Government of India not favour at present the idea of a protectorate over Oman, I would submit, for consideration, whether the protection of our interests will not require us to take some active steps when Mutrah and Muscat are again threatened. I have already explained the reasons which in my opinion would require us to adopt this course. With the enemy outside the towns a word from us followed if necessary by a few shells from one of our men-of-war in the har bour, would probably have the effect of dispersing the rebels as it has done before, and saving the property of our subjects from plunder. 17. But the best safeguard would be a clear intimation to the leading Sheikhs of Oman that, whatever differences they may have with their Sultan, we will not permit an attack on Mutrah and Muscat. I am aware that this would imply the active support of the present ruler in the event of a rebel lion against him, but without some such support it is difficult to see how the property of our subjects and their trade are to be protected, whilst such a clear exposition of our intentions would be the surest preventive against a rising, as the Chiefs would know that it would bring them into contact with our power. 18. In return for this support we might demand from the Sultan a closer reliance on us, an earnestness on his part to be willing to be guided by our advice, the right to inspect his fortifications and advise him in the matter of his defences for which we might supply him with a moderate amount of newer arms and ammunition, and lastly a voice in his political relations with the leading Chiefs of the interior. 19. If, on the other hand, it is considered that Seyyid Feysul is not a ruler to whom the Government of India w ould be willing to accord this measure of support, then we must be prepared to see the property and trade of our subjects placed in jeopardy on every occasion of a rising against his authority, and how often this may now happen it is impossible to say. The Sultan can always retire to the forts on an emergency, and unless the enemy are strong enough to invest them and force their capitulation, an arrangement will be come to as in the last rebellion with the result that the principal loss will fall on our people, and that trade will be for the time paralysed. 20. I may add that in both Mutrah and Muscat, our subjects ow r n the principal w r ealth in merchandise, goods and house property, whilst the export and import trade of the country is mainly in their hands. The value of this trade is shown in the last returns as 38 lakhs of dollars, and that is a low estimate. In point of commercial interests, Mutrah and Muscat may now almost be said to be British towns. 6 Foreign Office Pres# No. 181—17-5-95—56.SIMLA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External.

UecoZ was ef eld h 0lt a f mS ‘ the Sheikhs Abdullah bin Saleh and Hamnd-Al Jehafl, the forme/withTtmaU following had been admitted within the town and received as guests by the Suhan on the 11th and 12th most of Hamud’s party remaining 0 some m ^ beyond Muttreh His Highness gave these Sheikhs their dismissal with presents on the a ternoon ot the 12th, but they remained within the gates and parties of Bedouins of two or three continued to come in. After midnight the gate was seized, the rest of Hamud’s party admitted and the palace rushed the Sultan eventually escaping and reaching the Agency house, whence, bavin- declined to remain m asylum there, he retired to his fort of Jelali overlooking the Agency. 6 2. On receipt of Major Sadler’s telegraphic report of what had happened I requested the Commander of H. M. S. Sphinx to proceed at once to Muscat, and followed myself in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence as soon as she could be got ready. Calling at Jask I received your telegrams of 16th and No. £67 E. of 17th, and reached Muscat soon after noon of the 18th, the Sphinx having arrived at daybreak. H. M. S. Bramble arrived on the morning of the 20th. 3. The position as regards the contending parties, I found, on my arrival, to have remained practically the same as first telegraphed by Major Sadler and conveyed by me to Government. Sayed Peysul and his brother held the two forts overlooking the harbour on either flank of the town. There had been some accessions to the followers of His Highness, but neither in temper, courage nor equipment was the force at his disposal equal to the formidable task of dislodging the enemy from their occupation of the town. There had been constant firing, both musketry and guns, from the forts, but the results appeared to have been very feeble. 4. As regards our people, however, an important step had been taken towards the security of life and property. In an attempt to regain one of the town gates by the Sultan’s people, there had been fighting in the quarter occupied by the Hindu traders, and it was evident that they might at any moment be exposed to extreme peril. Major Sadler accordingly procured a truce till after sunset by his influence with both parties, and all British Indian subjects were removed with the assistance of the boats of H. M. S. Sphinx to a position of safety near the coal stores at Makalla on one side of the harbour. Their more valuable and portable property had already been lodged in the Agency house. 5. At the expiration of the truce at 8 p.m., no active resumption of hostilities took place, and since then spasmodic and desultory musketry fire with occasional bombardment by the guns of the forts has been earned on. The most important event since has been the arrival, on the morning ot the 20th, of a contingent of the reinforcements from Jaallan down the east coast, mainly of the Beni Boo Ali and Jenabel tribes, on whom, as being the most warlike of those attached to the Sultan’s cause, his hopes have chiefly rested. These reinforcements are stated to amount to some 000 out ot l,o expec e , u the former number must be accepted with reserve. Ihe remfoicements pie vious y received from Tan and Nakhl, amounting to perhaps 600 or/0 ° ’ generally not of a very warlike character. The Sultan has now, ‘ • . is known, 1,500 or more men at his disposal and it w doubtful whether the rebels Im-e more than half that number. The Ifhowever, ^ the advantage of holding the gates and the greater pait &gt; 56 V occupying a position from which it would he very difficult to dislodge them. After the arrival of the Beni Boo Ali on the morning of the 20th, a portion of the east end of the town was re-occupied by the Sultan, the rebels falling back a little. The position of the latter broadly speaking, now is, occupation of the town west of a line drawn from the Cutoms House to the Bab feaghir or small gate. 6. The conduct of the rebels, following the precedent of 1868, when a revolt against the power of Sayed Salim produced a state of affairs closely corresponding to that now existing, has been exemplary. Immediately after seizing the place they took precautions by the placing of guards and patrols, for the safety of person and property generally, and especially in regard to British subjects, their declared object being to obtain the government and not to plunder. 7. Of the intentions of the rebels sufficient is not yet known to form a decided opinion as to the interests in which this rising has been made ; but from the fact that Sayed Saood bin Azzan (the Imam) is now with the rebels in the town, the command having been handed over to him on his arrival four days ago by Abdullah bin Saleh, and that Saleh himself brought him from Samad, while Sayed Ibrahim bin Kais is said to be on his way here from Rostak, it may be presumed so far that the pretensions of the Rostak branch of the A1 boo Saidis is favoured by Sheikh Saleh. It must, however, be noted that the three leaders, who effected the coup de main. Sheikhs Abdullah bin Saleh, Mohsin bin Aamir, and Hamud-Al Jehafi are among those who recently visited Zanzibar and are connected with the intrigues which were ripe there ; it is posssible, therefore, that this rising has some connection with aspirations from that quarter. 8. The rebels have indeed all along been very guarded as to any disclosure of their views in regard to the future of the Sultanate. The leaders having clearly intimated that they are tired of Sayed FeysuPs rule, and that they intend to end it, have been reticent on their intentions as to the ruler they propose to put up in his place. It may be accepted, however, that Hamud A1 Jehafi is entirely devoted to the cause of Sayed Abdul Aziz, though his following being small be will be obliged to fall in with the views of the more powerful leaders. Sheikh Saleh would, in the event of success, have a commanding voice in the election of a ruler, w r hich would be decided probably by the general feeling of the Hinawi tribes. 9. In dealing with the position as it now stands and may hereafter develop, I am guided by the principle laid down by the Government of India in letter No. 276 E. of the 9th February 1886, as to “ the normal policy of Government towards Muscat, being one of non-interference in dynastic struggles or internal administration.’’ This attitude, which has been adopted by the Political Agent from the beginning, and has since been maintained by myself, has been rendered the easier by the moderation and orderly temper evinced by the rebels, wffio have all along been most ready to meet Major Sadler’s wishes on any points he has had to urge in connection with British interests. It has been facilitated also by the fact of the Sultan having made no demands for armed assistance. In any case, and even apart from considera tions of the general policy of Government, the most urgent expediency, if not absolute necessity, would have demanded the adoption of the course followed, as very large material, and indeed vital, British interests were at stake, a great amount of property and over two hundred lives of British Indian subjects being at the outset of hostilities, and for several days afteiwvards at the mercy of those who had seized the place, I would request that I may be favoured with an axpression of the views of Government upon the matters which I have set forth, and with any special ms Auctions that may be thought proper on the course to be followed in future. .» . • £ No. 477 E., dated Fort William, the 1st March 1895.

You will naturally give Sultan no expectation of receiving assistance in coercing rebels. No. 3 A., dated Muscat, the 28th February 1895. From— Colonel F. A. Wilson, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 2 A. of the 21st, I have the honour to report, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council, that no decisive change in the position at Muscat, as between the Sultan and those in revolt against him, has declared itself. 2. My telegrams of this date will have placed you in possession substantially of the facts of the present position, and it is hardly necessary to dilate upon them. The Sultan has received some accession of strength and has gained some ground both in the town and outside it in the direction of Riyam, but there is no such spirit displayed by either His Highness or his people as to warrant a hope of any immediate or decisive success. The general opinion is that there is no such enthusiasm for the cause of their ruler, on the part of those who have, to the number, it is supposed of nearly 4,000, gathered to him, but who are perhaps actuated rather by the normal tribal feeling of the Ghafiris against the Hinawis, than by a love for their Sultan, as to lead them to heroic efforts on his behalf. It seems thought that, without the Chief’s personal lead- ing, the tribesmen are not likely to make any sustained or resolute attack on the rebels* position. 3. It is to be regretted that in this crisis little disposition has been evinced by the Sultan towards cordial communication with us, not only has he abstained from seeking our help, but he has also refrained generally from any spontaneous intimation of his plans. Even in response to explicit invitation to turnish information as to his prospects, having regard to the very serious extent to which most important British interests are imperilled by the state of civil war now prevailing, and his responsibilities in this connection, he has supplied me with no intelligence to communicate to Government. I expressly reminded His Highness two days ago that, in regard to the troubles at Muscat, or which news must have been received with much concern by Government, I hoped that he would enable me to report what prospects existed of the restora- lon of oider, and the removal of danger to life and property in which British interests were largely involved, but I have received nothing definite in reply. 4. There has been a development of the plans of the rebels as reported in my elegram of to-day, and I enclose a copy, in translation, of Sheikh Saleh’s letter intimating the objects and intentions of, as stated by him, the Hinawi 89 tribes generally. It must be remembered, however, that all the Hinawi tribes are not to be counted as necessarily attached to Saleh’s leadership, and the com paratively small number of the rebel forces in and about Muscat is a further significant point. At the same time it is reported that Saleh has proclaimed hostilities between the Hinawi and Ghafiri tribes generally, and as noted above it is probably rather to tribal hostility than to personal feeling for himself that the Sultan owes his present support. 5. I regret that it is quite impossible, with the present information at my disposal, to make any forecast of the probable course and result of the present struggle. Rumours have reached me to-day of an intention on the part of the Sultan’s people to make an important attack, but with my experience of the desultory and feeble operations which have been constantly carried on for more than a fortnight, I am quite unable to place any reliance on them, and still less to give any prospect of a speedy solution of the present crisis. 6. While having no reason to anticipate the probability of any departure on the part of Government from the policy of non-intervention which has been the rule in our relations with Oman, I thought it right to consult the Senior Naval Officer present as to the operations he considered available in the event of a resort to force. Captain Pelly informs me, as I was fully prepared to hear, that apart from aiding the Sultans by fire from his forts which would he of doubtful efficacy, the only effectual means of enforcing a demand on the rebels to evacuate tne town would be to shell it, with the result probably of very exten sive destruction, in which the property of British subjects would be inevitably involved. My attitude has been in accordance with the neutral policy which I understand it has been the desire of Government to maintain. Should there be any further instructions for my guidance in this respect, I would ask that they mav be communicated to me by telegraph. 7 With regard to the concluding somewhat obscure sentence of Sheikh Saleh’s letter, I refrain from comment until further information as to its truth and meaning is available. _ [Translations.] Dated 30th Shaban 13l2=26th February 1895.

Wilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, 4 5 $ In continuation of my letter No. 3-A. of 28th February, I have the honour to report, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General in Council, the course of events at Muscat during the past week. 2. As regards the struggle between the Sultan and his subjects in armed revolt, the position has not essentially changed. The Sultan has continued to hold the forts overlooking the town and harbour, and the heights command ing them, and has had free communication with the adjacent port of Mutrah and the coast generally. I consider it would be quite impossible for the rebels to attempt an attack on tlie forts without first securing the adjacent heights, which are held by the Sultan, and for the assault and occupation of which, their inferiority in number places them at a disadvantage. Some small reinforcements have joined him, and he has intimated the receipt of assurances of support from the Ghafiris of the Dhahireh. His adherents, however, though strong in numbers have failed to improve their position within the town. The issue of the struggle therefore remains, as far as can he judged, as doubtful and remote as before, from an immediate military point of view. 3. On the 2nd instant a number of the Khoja subjects of Government appealed to me with an expression of their serious anxiety for the safety of their property. It was quite evident from all that was constantly heard, that there was grave reason for this anxiety, and later in the day more urgent complaints were made by some of the banian community. I was satisfied that plunder and injury was actually occurring, and that there was the greatest danger that this would extend, the followers on both sides being out of control. In view of the further fact that the prospect of a termination to the present state of things was quite uncertain, I considered that the time had fully arrived to warrant action in the interests of the security of our subject’s property, and that it was distinctly my duty to take action. Major Sadler, accordingly, at my desire intimated to the Sultan that we required him to assent to a three days* truce for the removal of the more valuable property of British subjects, and to furnish a safe conduct to two of the rebel-leaders to meet his re presentatives for the arrangement of its details. Ihe Sultan readily agreed, and a similar demand was conveyed to the rebel-leader. 4. There was a cessation of hostilities accordingly soon afteriioon on the 3rd, and the same afternoon two of the representatives of the Sultan, and two Sheikhs on the part of the rebels, having met Major Sadler and myself at the agency, accepted the terms which we considered necessary for guarding, as far as possible, against a violation of the truce, or danger to our people in remov ing their property. On the 4th the British Indian traders were busy from an early hour in transporting their goods, and the harbour was. covexed ^/th boats. The operation did not, however, proceed very long without friction, and the following day the tension became more acute, the wilder Bedouin portion of the rebels crowding the bazaars and streets, and obstructing, P unc 61 ■ ing and blackmailing the traders, and being out of the control of their leaders. This reached such a point that on the third day of the truce, 6th March, some shots having been fired, there was a panic, and all the traders a am ouet xen attempts to recover more of their property and left their shops an s ( J res * may be hoped that the more valuable and portable proper y ias, 01 ,. part, been removed, and it was evidently hopeless, botli roin e 1 r. - , procuring labour, and freedom of movement, as well as iom i , Bedouins, to remove the remainder of the more bulky goods ^ strong remonstrances were addressed to the rebels, two o 1 clearlv again summoned to meet us at the agency. It ‘^Xrtnee of tlm impossible, late in the afternoon, to restore lie e ec terms of the truce or to resume the rescue of proper ). 5. I took this opportunity of '•peaking very forcibly jj^jrnal tatives, pointing out that though we had not intervened m &lt;heu internal12 contests, the injury and plunder of the property of British subjects was quite another and more serious matter, and brushing aside their excuses and assurances that all losses should be compensated, gave them distinctly to understand, that our moderation must not be misinterpreted, and that in respect of the plunder of our people by them they must he held to be in opposi- tion to Government. 6. The rebel-leaders who met me on the 3rd maintained that their movement was that of all the Hinawi tribes, and that the will of Shedch Saleh was that of all those tribes. These contentions are not established, and it cannot yet be said that there is an unanimously active Hinawi participation in the rising; but there has been an accession to the rebel numbers, and it would seem that the principal Hinawi tribes are represented among them; there is a talk also of the powerful Baniboo Hassan tribe coming up in numbers. They repeated their wish to be, to offer the rule to the Sultan of Zanzibar, and if he declined, to one of the sons of Azzan ; but they have not actually set up this alternative ruler, though they must be aware that their first choice is out of the question. In connection with my vigorous remonstrances on the in juries to British property yesterday, Mohsin bin Amir, one of these two repre sentatives, having said that if ordered by us, they would leave, explained later that this was a courteous form of expression; but that if we used force they would go. Without counting too much on this utterance, I am disposed to think that a positive demand on our part, coupled with a show of force in sup- port of the Sultan, would be of great efficacy, should the course of later events decide Government to adopt this action. 7. With regard to an incidental suggestion yesterday for the prolongation of the truce, the strongest objection to it was intimated on behalf of the Sultan, who appears to rely on further supports which he had received and been pro mised. There have, however, been rumours of his disposition to treat with the rebels, and I am unable to attach any importance to his apparent firmness of re solve to act vigorously against his enemies. 8. I enclose translated purport of letter received to-day from the Sultan in which he asked for the aid of Government in repelling those in revolt against him, to which I am replying, that my instructions do not authorise my com plying with His Highness’ request, and in this connection, and with reference to*the third paragraph of my last letter, I have now to state, that two days after the date of that letter, Major Sadler, in the course of a visit to the Sultan, found His Higfhness profuse in his apologies for his apparent failure to com municate fully with me for the information of Government, regarding his plans and prospects for the restoration of order; the fact, as explained by him, being that he was very anxious and disturbed, and had in fact little or nothing to con vey. 9. The instructions of Government conveyed to me in your cypher telegram of the 3rd reached me -to-day. A local and temporary cessation of hostilities was demanded from both sides to enable Major Sadler to meet Sheikh Saleh at their outpost ; and the necessary communication was made to him in the presence of other leaders, Major Sadler adding on my behalf, that the eventuality contem plated had practically arisen. The Sheikh in reply could not deny damage and plunder of property by his followers, and reiterated assurances that had already been given of full compensation for all injury or loss. He asked also that all the remaining property in the town might be removed, and was told in reply that this was impossible, and that the acts of his people, apart from any other cause, had prevented, this being done on the last day of the truce. In regard to his assurances of compensation, he was told that, though the fullest responsi bility rested upon him, he being neither ruler of, nor holding authority in, the state, his assurances could not be admitted as adequate. 10. There was an omission in my last report which I would now supply. On the afternoon of the 22nd February on my landing at the agency, I found that one of the sepoys of the Marine Battalion of the agency guard had been wounded, while on sentry, by a gunshot, probably from the rebel side, but accid ental as far as he was concerned. The wound which was at first pronouncedvery dangerous, has progressed very favourably, and the man is, I am happy to say, considered out of danger. I regret further to report that Othman, a peon of the agency establishment, was killedby a shot fired through the closed window- shutter of the house of a bania. He had conveyed a letter from the Political *3} Agent to the rebels, and at the same time escorted a bania, who had sought permission to look after his property. He afterwards accompanied this man to his house, and was shot in an upper-room where he could not be seen, the shot apparently coming from the direction occupied by the Sultan’s men at some distance.

After compliments ,—It is not hidden from your honour that a great calamity has befallen us from the coming of these rebels to Muscat; it affects both us and the subjects of the great British Government. We hope from the favours of the great Government that it will attend to us and assist us in repelling these invaders, for we surely know that Government will not approve of this (state of affairs). The favours of Government towards us have always been great and their mercy on us henign in the past and for the future.

Wilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 4-A. of the 7th instant, and my telegram of four days later announcing that peace had been concluded, I have the 'honour to report, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council, the further course of events up to this date, and the present position of affairs at Muscat. 2. On the 8th it having become necessary for the Lawrence to re provision and obtain water, I allowed the vessel to proceed to Karachi as the nearest port for the purpose, and landing myself was received by Major Sadler at the agency. The doors and windows of the house on the side towards the rebels had been protected with sand-hags, to guard against stray bullets should the musketry fire become more general, as the result of an advance on the part of the rebels, in the direct line of which the building would have stood. 3. Meanwhile there were, as noted in the seventh paragraph of my last letter, signs of a disposition to treat, and information was received on the even ing of the 8th, from the emissary of the Sultan to Sheikh Saleh of the previous day, that the latter looked for our mediation in the negotiations; this called for no notice. On the 9th the reports of the negotiations continued, and it seemed confidently expected that a settlement would shortly be arrived at. So early a conclusion as followed was however hardly expected. About sunset a message from the Sultan followed Major Sadler and myself on board H. M. S. Sphinx which we were visiting, to the effect that an understanding with his enemies was on the point of being arrived at, and that His Highness after having awaited for some time the return of his envoy, desired not to delay the intimation longer. This was followed after night fall by a further message, that all *was arranged, and that the evacuation of the town by the rebels was expected during the night. It was the wish of His Highness that our people should return to their quarters in the town, to look after their property, as soon as possible, but this was absolutely out of the question till the departure of the rebels was actually accomplished, or in fact during the hours of darkness. To have come into contact with the followers of the rebels, who had evidently for some time been getting constantly more out of control of their leaders, and whose lawless instincts seemed certainly likely to be more fully roused at the moment of retirement, would have been fraught with extreme peril to the Hindu and other traders. It was only possible to urge upon the Sultan, in pursuance of the constantly repeated warnings already given, the adoption of precautions against licence and plunder on the part of the tribesmen on his side. 4. The fears that license would be rife among the rebels in the course of their evacuation of the place, were fully justified, the town on the morning of the lOth piescnting a scene of ruin and destruction besides being found to have been fired in several places. The shops, stores, etc., had generally been broken into, grain and rice bags burst, with their contents scattered, and chests and boxes tossed in disorder. The exact extent of the damage and plunder, and the possible share in it of the Arabs and Eiluchis who entered on the evacuation of the place by the rebels, cannot yet be stated. The British Indian traders returned to their places on the morning of the 10th, but much confusion and disoider still prevailed, and even the first clearing of the wreckm streets and houses was a work of t,me. The extinguishing of the fires also though the town is fortunately not generally of an inflammable character took time Our people did not spend the night at their houses, hut returned to Makalla where they had been m refuge for three weeks, and where the pro perty they had been able to remove was stored. They have since resumed their abode m the town. . auwcu 5. It seems to me probable that the intimation to Sheikh Saleh with others of the rebel-leaders, of the decided policy of Government in reference to their professed aspirations towards a union of Muscat with Zanzibar, inclined them to give a more ready acceptance to peace overtures. It is quite possible that Saleh had fostered hopes among those associated with him in his recent enter prise, that help and encouragement would he forthcoming from Zanzibar, and there are indications that this was the case. 0. As regards the matter referred to in the concluding parograph of my letter No. 3-A. of the 28th February, no further information is available. There was a show on the part of Sheikh Saleh, of explaining away the con cluding obscure allusion in his letter, of which a copy has been submitted, as referring to some form of taxation, perhaps connected in his mind with French possessions in North Africa. Sheikh Saleh finally, after leaving Muscat, stated that he w T as unable to find the letter he had received from Rashid bin Azaiz on the Sultan’s part, for communication to us. I do not attach any importance to the matter, and the Wazir repudiated the possibility of any such threat as seemed implied in Sheikh Saleh’s original letter, having emanated from the Sultan. In this connection I have to report that the French cruiser Troude arrived here on the morning of the 13th. Her commander paid me a visit the same day, and I understood from him that the vessel under his command had sailed from Toulon on the 13th February. I have heard since that his orders reached him at Obok. 7. On the morning of the 13th I paid an informal visit to the Sultan His Highness still remained in Fort Jalali, the palace being hardly yet fit for his occupation. Resides ascertaining His Highness’ proposals generally, for the restoration of order, and re-establishment of his authority, I desired especially to learn his views in regard to the exacting of reparation for injuries inflicted on British interests, as there seemed a general belief that his terms with the rebels included a full amnesty in respect of their acts, and all liability con nected therewith. The Sultan did not state the terms he had made, nor was he very cordially communicative on his affairs or prospects. lie objected that ■we had not assisted him, and attempted to argue that the care of British pio- perty and interests rested with us, and that by our non-intervention v e lad acquiesced, if not in the injury indicted, at least in the idea that compensa tion for losses would meet all the liabilities in the case. I woul no , o course, admit His Highness’ arguments on this score. On the specific object, how- ever, which 1 had in view, the Sultan on being pressed declared, that those who had been guilty of violating the property of British subjects must be responsible, and'reparation be exacted from their possesswns, his meaning being clear, that the rebels should be held liable, and that th ' s ^ ^ tisfv he enforced against their export trade. This does not by any me that terms, holding the rebels exempt from t re consequ , ^ ^ were not made ; with these, I conceive, we are no s l , ® cl ? • ■ .^ythino- to is satisfactory to know that the Sultan does no PJ 1 7 ou {;. hamper our action. In regard to the connection o remarking that break, the Sultan spoke of the fact as being unqi ’enemies, is the Mohsin bin Amir, who had been c01 ^P! c l 101 ,l S i^ Sultan of Zanzibar. He brother of Hilal bin Amir a leading ^ ^ 7th 8. During .U« Into d™ r,*SS-w'“ta™ considerably increased, and before their ^c. 16 G. C. press, Simla.—No 20 F.

They were, however, outnumbered by the adherents of the ruler, who bad probably between 3,000 and 4,000. 9 An application for the usual monthly instalment of the subsidy having been received on the 13th, payment was made in ordinary course. This appeared to me expedient and proper, apart from any question as to the view to be taken of the liability on account of the losses of British subjects, and the action that may hereafter be deemed necessary in that regard. My reasons were that it would be very undesirable, at the close of such a crisis with its protracted strain and heavy expenditure, to deprive the Sultan of resources urgently necessary to arrange his remaining difficulties. But there was a stronger reason still in the fact that the large number of tribesmen who had come at the Sultan’s call to his aid, remained to be a source of confusion, disorder and possible peril, and that it was in the highest degree desirable that His Highness should be in a position to pay them off and get rid of them. 10. I will not delay this report on the events connected with the close of hostilities, and leading up to the present position, for my conclusion upon that position or recommendations for finally dealing with it. Very grave considerations are, in my opinion, involved. This important trade port with laro-e foreign interests, exclusively British in effect, has been overrun by hoides of wild Arab tribesmen, who, whatever the actual desire of their more intelli gent leaders may have been, have gradually given their lawless and predatory instincts freer play, till serious plundering, besides wanton injury, has been done. This result would seem to demand that the offenders should be brought to account for their acts in such manner as to prevent the establishment of a belief among the wilder people of Oman, and those who recklessly lead them to deeds of violence, that outrage and disorder affecting peaceful British com merce, can be lightly entered upon as a mere incident of their internal jealousies. I hope very shortly to submit a complete report on these matters. Telegram No. 9, dated Jask, the 23rd March 1895. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta.

From-COLONEL F. A. Wilson, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In my previous despatches I have reported, for the information of His Excellency the \ iceroy and Governor-General in Council, the leading facts in the course of the recent outbreak at Muscat. I have now the honour to forward * Letter from Political Agent, Mugnat, No. 6G-A., c0 Py of tlie report* I have received dated isth March 1895, with enclosures. from the Political .Agent at Muscat ia . , i-i • a ^ eta i le( l account of the occur rence, and his comments on the incidents which marked it. 2. Major Sadler’s report gives a connected narrative of the course of events, and of the action taken on our part in connection with them, and in dealing with the subject I will, as far as possible, avoid repetition, and confine myself to the considerations which may occupy the attention of Government as regards the future action which the situation may call for. 3. My attitude throughout has been, in accordance with the established policy of Government of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Oman, one of strict neutrality ; this had been adopted by Major Sadler from the first moment, when the rebels, having by a treacherous blow seized the town, had obliged the Sultan to retire to his forts. Interference after the means for it had become available, even with the direct and solo object of guarding British interests, could hardly have taken any other form than that of a participation in, and direction of, the Sultan’s operations against his enemies. This would have been a necessity of the position as actually existing. The houses, shops, and stores of our subjects are scattered through the heart of the town, consist ing of very confined lanes, with closely packed buildings, and fell at the outset, after the surprise, into the hands of the rebels. Throughout the struggle, extending over twenty-five days, the greater part of the town remained in possession of the rebels, and this portion contained by far the larger number of our people’s quarters, which were thus absolutely at their mercy. There was at no time any definite movement or operation of the rebels specifically threatening British property at any particular point which was open to us t*o resist by force. The sea face exposed to naval attack consists, besides the Political Agency and houses of British traders, of the customs landing place and residences of the Sultan and his relatives. It is true that one of the latter buildings occupied by the enemy was a good deal battered by the fort guns, and could doubtless have been effectually destroyed by fire from the ships. But I think it doubtful if this would have seriously affected the enemy, who could have easily retired a little back, and any general use of the fire from our ships would have led to the indiscriminate destruction of the houses not only of British Indian, hut also of peaceful Arab subjects, and to a probably extensive conflagration, besides the loss of innocent lives. The only practically available course in my opinion, would have been, as above stated, to have openly sided with the Sultan, directed and aided his operations from the forts, and generally supported and co-operated with him. 4. Apart, however, from the foregoing considerations was the fact that the rebel leaders had at the outset not only professed the utmost good will towards us and used their authority in guarding our people s property, but had also displayed a capacity for controlling their followers and checking license, which were highly creditable. This control unfortunately did not survive the strain of the prolonged hostile occupation, and perhaps also the efforts of the leaders may have later nostue otcupau , i J- it ; rf i wee k there were manv complaints of been somewhat relaxed. Daring tlie tuna weeKLueic T H the nlunder of the property remaining m the town, from Bnti I mn the piunuer or i l i j, , beea rem0T ed from a position of great periHoI place of refuge o' o'w’parTfor r'threTdays’ces^ Gono/hcfstmUeTto admit measures for the rescue of such goods as could beremoved. The tension became such as to interfere with this truce towards its close, but much merchandise and £oods w T ere taken from the town to a place of safety. After this it is to be feared that disorder rapidly increased within the rebel position, and at the last moment reached a climax, for alter the evacu ation not only w^ere the shops and stores generally found to have been plunder ed, but the town had been set on fire in several places; in fact pillage had only been limited by the inability to carry off bulky goods such as rice and grain, and to this had been added gross wanton mischief and destruction. 5. For this, I venture to express my opinion, a reckoning should be exact ed ; the deplorable result, though not perhaps desired by the rebel Sheikhs, who may receive credit for their exertions in restraining their followers during the earlier days, is one for which they and the tribesmen must, I consider, be held absolutely and fully liable. The principles directing our policy of non-intervention in the internal conflicts of Oman, and the considerations governing the question of our em ployment of force, above dealt with, could hardly be fully appreciated by the Arab tribes, who will he more likely to misinterpret our moderation, especially in view of the presence of two of tier Majesty’s ships close to the scene. An impression that British property could with impunity he exposed to the rapacity of lawless followers, as an incident in the pursuit of tribal ambi tions or enmities, would be most unfortunate. Such a feeling would not only render a violent or ambitious Sheikh reckless in embarking on such enterprises as the one now closed, hut would obviously tend to make the tribesmen more ready to follow his lead, in the hope of plunder. 6. The conclusion based on the above views which I would submit for the consideration of Government is that the principle of satisfaction should be enforced against those who have violated British property, and this not merely by way of a money compensation for loss, but also in the form of punishment and example. Thus an indemnity might be demanded, and be levied by a cess, apart from the ordinary duties, on the produce exported from the tracts peopled by the offending tribes. And unless Government be disposed to consider the question of closer relations with Oman, carrying with them a more direct concern with its internal affairs, and system of government by its ruler, action with regard to the indemnity, I venture to suggest, should take the form of a demand upon the Sultan. In such case it would be desirable that the fact of this reparation being the direct consequence of our demand should be accentuated in the clearest manner possible to those affected. 7. The Sultan has not given me any clear intimation as to the measures which he proposes to take in the matter of the injuries which British subjects have suffered. He has doubtless had many pressing cares, and may not yet see his way very clearly. It would have been satisfactory, however, if he had enabled me to communicate more fully to Government his own sense of his responsibilities in this connection and his proposals for meeting them. Yes* terday morning I paid a formal visit to His Highness and offered my congra tulations on his relief from his recent troubles and my hope that his remaining difficulties might be surmounted. The Sultan replied that what had happened was very serious, and that it behoved Government to look into it; this was a repetition of the remark he had made at my informal visit of the 13th, to which I had not at the time paid particular attention. It is, as it stands, somewhat vague, but its repetition gives it significance, and taken in connection with a remark in the earlier interview, as to our aid in his enforcement of our claims against the export trade of the rebels perhaps indicates a desire on His High ness part to lean more directly on the support of Government. The Sultan, however, on both occasions postponed a clearer expression of his meaning or his wishes, saying he would reply more fully later on important points. 18i S. Upon the result of the recent conflief n«5 nfiw.fi'n™ n rulor, and the prestige of his powerful opponent, Sheikh Saleh bki Ali itfs So early yet to form a mature opinion TW nil rr,-.™ e A n ; 11 ’ 1118 to ° tribes forming the late coalition against him, the power ohthf SuVtUT ^ weak and seldom exerted, must now he, for’the Cat least ^l^Th'eyha^ not received any chastisement for their acts, and have drawn a considerable sum from the Sul an as the price of peace. This and the heavy payments made to the friendly Ghafn tribes, besides the cost of their maintenance for a long period, added to the loss of private property and customs dues, must have very seriously impoverished the Sultan, to whom money, as the means for maintaining a doubtful influence among the f ribes, is of the utmost value &gt; • °'i 0n . , tl10 °,‘ ' ler \ lan&lt;1 &gt; t,le crisls l&gt;as shown a numerous faction arrayed on Ms side, though perhaps more by reason of hereditary jealousies of their Llmaui rivals than of personal devotion, and this advantage, if -judiciously pressed, might be made a means to increase of strength. J 10. As for Sheikh Saleh, his failure to carry to a successful issue the declared object of setting up a new ruler, for which he had collected a consi derable Hinawi following, can hardly fail to be injurious. His influence in the Hinawi faction lias long been very great, and has made him always a for midable factor in the politics of Oman. He has now failed to achieve success in a momentous attempt and must to some extent have lost prestige. The full after elects of the struggle, however, await development, and need opportunity for further observation. 11. On one point, however, that the heavy expenses and losses which have fallen on the Sultan must have quite crippled him financially, there can be no doubt. In this connection I have to report that a week ago His Highness, while carefully avoiding any direct request, or even formal reference, sounded me as to the reception Government would be likely to accord to the question of assisting him in the way of a loan. I was of course .unable, in the absence of instructions, to give an opinion, but added that a definite knowledge of His Highness* plans in reference to the situation would doubtless be necessary to the consideration of such a proposal. The question is one that may possibly come up, and I accordingly submit it for the consideration of Government. 12. It is my gratifying duty in closing this report to bring to the favour able notice of Government the able and energetic conduct by Major Sadler of the very onerous and responsible duties which devolved on him in the course of these protracted troubles at Muscat. The strain was a severe and prolonged one, and especially in its earlier stage, when very critical questions were cons tantly arising, carried with it grave responsibility. Major Sadler applied him self to the difficulties confronting him with great firmness and ability, and his mastery over the language and familiarity with the people of Oman and their affairs were of extreme value. His acknowledgments to Captain Felly of H. M. S. Sphinx, the senior naval officer in the Gulf, have been recorded in his report, and it only remains to me to add my cordial endorsement of his words. No. 56-A., dated Maskat, the 18th March 1895. From—-M ajor J. Hayes Sadler, Political Agent and Her Britannic Majesty s Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a narrative of events in connection with the late rising against Ma and the action taken by this Agency in reference thereto. 2. Towards the close of January last Sheikh Saleh bin Ali, the powerful Sheikh of (he Harth, sent his son Abdullah to join that noted free oo^er^e ^ Hamood al Jahafi, who has frequently figured in reports fio ^ yj’ Nezwah with the ostensible object of effecting a con ^posin' factions in that town, and on the 10th February the Sultan received information that Sheikh Abdullah had brought about a truce of six months between Sheikh Badr bin Hilal, the Nezwah chief, and his opponent, Sheikh Suleiman bin Seif ar Riyami, and that he and Sheikh Hamood al Jahah were on their wav to visit Ilis Highness in IVlaskat mconnection with the affairs of Nezwah. For some time past His Highness the Sultan had been anxious to acquire possession of this town. 11 hen, then, he heard that Sheikhs Abduilali and Hamood w r ere on their way to visit him, he had hopes that matters were taking a turn favourable to his views. 3 . The two Sheikhs and their followers, numbering it was supposed about 140 persons, arrived at Rui, 5 miles from Matrah, the following morning. Sheikh Abdullah, who was accompanied by Sheikh Mohsin bin Amir al Harthi came on to Maskat with 40 of the Harth; they were hospitably received by the Sultan, quarters w T ere placed at their disposal, and the usual arrangements made for their entertainment. The rest of their followers -were detained at Rui by the Sultan’s orders. On the morning of the 12th February Sheikh Hamood al Jahafi came to Maskat with a small following and had an interview with His Highness, after which he was entertained in the quarters allotted to Sheikhs Abdullah and Mohsin. In the afternoon the Sultan sent the Sheikhs their dismissal presents, a bag of 1,200 dollars, coffee, hulwah, etc., and the party notified their inten tion of leaving Maskat that evening or at the latest the following morning. After dark, however, some more Bedouins made their way into the town in par ties of twos and threes, and it would seem from what I subsequently heard that the Wahabis and Hydramis, the Sultan’s most faithful guards, began to get suspicious of these visitors and gave His Highness a warning, to which he paid no attention. About 4 a m., on the 1 3th, Sheikh Abdullah’s party inside the town rushed the gates and let in their comrades who had crossed over from Rui through the Wadi Kabir. In the meanwhile the house of Seyyid Badr bin Seif, the Sultan's general, had been surrounded and any action on his part effectually stopped. No defence was made at either of the gates. The Sultan’s new palace was then entered through a side door, the gate-keeper being cut over, and an attack was made on the Sultan in the old palace which adjoins the new. The attack was repelled by the Sultan and the few men lie had with him, His Highness shoot ing the two first rebels who attempted to enter. 4. The first intimation I received of the emeute was at daybreak from the Custom’s Farmer, who, however, could give me no information as to what had occurred. I sent out to enquire, and in the meanwTiile the Sultan’s wife and her sister-in-law made their way to the Agency over the roofs of the Baniahs’ houses, told me of the attack on the palace, and asked me to protect the Sultan. I sent their attendant back with a message, offering His Highness the protection of the British Agency should he not be able to hold the palace, any show of force on our part in that direction being out of the question. His Highness shortly afterwards arrived crossing over the roofs of the intervening houses, and the remainder of the occupants of the palace were with drawn in the same w ay. On meeting His Highness I again offered him and his family our protection in case his position did not admit of any other resort; at that time indeed very little was knowm of the actual state of affairs beyond the main fact that the city had been taken. The Sultan thanked me for my offer, and said he did not wish to seek protection at present as the Forts were still in his hands ; he left the Agency for Fort Julali, where his family subse quently joined him His Highness was naturally much agitated, and his face Tvas bleeding from the effects of splinters struck off a wooden railing by a rebel shot. I afterwards heard that His Highness’ brother, Seyyid Muhammad bin Turin, had jumped out of his house on to the foreshore wiien the palace was attacked and made his way to Fort Merani. The next day, at His High ness’ request, I obtained a safe conduct from the rebels for the withdrawal of Seyyid Muhammad bin Turki’s family from their house to Fort Julali. 20British sul^e “ardt£rToportT n lTeter n tr grCSS rrotection of Sheikh Abdullah, whom I took to L tlm rphln„ ^ Ure - A) , Was written to he held directly responsible for all In. to mar subject’s in^fe orproperty^ 6 H ^ reply (Annexure B) intimated that he would restrain his foM^/ T * 7 ' ? 8 damage, that the rising was a general Hinawi movement and W r” v' 8 was to dethrone the Sultan. The escort wns pnllorl i f ’+1 lat ^^object notices of nationality were issued to British suhjects°to affix^Mhe dooraof their houses and godowns, and all precautions were taken which are usual on occasions of disturbance. Owing to the suddenness with which events had de dared themselves it was impossible to remove British property to a place of satety, neither boats nor porterage were available; the leading merchants b oudi some of their treasure and valuables to the Agency for safe custody, hut the majority shut themselves up in their houses after affixing notices to their doors. % At Matrah the Khojas withdrew to their fort which was supplied with a British flag, and British subjects of the Baniah community were advised to shut up their houses, affix the notices supplied, and take to the shipping in the road stead in the view of the expected advance of Sheikh Saleh with'the object of occupying that town. 6. Shortly after the Sultan had entered Port Julaii, a cannonade and rifle fire was commencd from both forts on the old palace, a rush at which was made along the beach by about 30 men of the Sultan’s adherents who had began to arrive in boats from Matrah and Saddab ; this rush was repelled by a volley from the windows of the palace, and the party ran up to Port Merani, with a loss of six of their number. Another attempt was made to occupy Seyyid Pahad’s house adjoining the old palace, and the Customs house ; this and the old palace were actually held for about an hour, after which the Sul tan’s men withdrew to Port Julaii. It was unfortunate for the Sultan that this position was not permanently occupied, for it would have formed a strong basis from which to attempt the recapture of the new palace later on. As it was, both houses fell into the rebels’ hands and greatly strengthened their defensive position when an advance was made by the Sultan’s reinforce ments. About 1 P. M. I received a verbal message from the rebels, intimating that Sheikh Saleh would arrive with a large force that evening^ or the follow ing morning to occupy Matrah, and suggesting that British subjects should be warned to look after their property. I sent the Agency Munshi to Sheikh Abdullah, warning him again that he would be held responsible for all damage done to our subjects both here and at Matrah, and desiring that this warning he communicated at once to the advancing party, which Sheikh Abdullah said he would do. Hie Agency Munshi reported to me that he had seen all three leaders, who were unanimous in declaring that the people of Oman were tired of Seyyid Peysal s rule, and that they were determined to have a Sultan who would really rule the conn ry. Sheikhs Abdullah and Mohsin said they would act as he who had the power, referring to Slieikk Saleh, might direct, whilst Sheikh Hamood intimated that no one would content him but His Highness Seyyid Abdul Azeez. The position on the evening of the 13th stood thus . the Sultan and his irother occupied the two forts overlooking the harbour, a le ou s ,nd one tower on the city walls on the south-east side of the town were lield ly his men, whilst the rebels occupied the town itse . , bought for some days to he only 150, but I have oqq nformation that when the coup was made there were e j under d them. They did not molest any of the inhabitants, and w he control of their leaders, who said they had come to rule, not to rob. theyassumed a quiet defensive position in the town awaiting further reinforce ments. 7. The downward mail arrived at 7 a. m. on the 14th February ; Mr. A. Mackirdy, the Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company, at once placed her at my disposal, and I despatched the vessel to Charbar with my telegram to your address (Annexure C). No one was allowed to land, and of course all trade was at a standstill. Before the departure of the mail steamer the Wazeer came to me with a message from Ilis Highness, asking me if I would send the vessel to Soor to bring up reinforcements for His Highness. I regretted that for several reasons I was unable to comply with this request. Apart from other considerationSj the fact that the persons and property of our subjects were in the hands of the rebels would alone have, been sufficient to make the policy of strict neutrality, which I adopted from the first, one of absolute necessity. The rebels employed their time during the day in wreck ing the Sultan’s palaces and auctioning all his furniture and eifects which they had not destroyed. Several pieces of furniture and other articles were bought in by Baniahs to return to His Highness; an order was issued forbid ding British subjects from having any dealings with the rebels in this connec tion on their own account. A letter (Annexure I)) was received from Sheikh Abdullah suggesting a community of interests between himself and me, and intimating his readiness to abide by what I thought advisable in the interests of all; to this I replied (Annexure E) that what I required of him in the present state of affairs in Maskat was the effectual protection of our subjects and their property from his followers. S. Early on the morning of the 15th the white Mutawwah flag was seen flying from the palace flagstaff, which seemed to indicate that the rebels were acting in the interests of the Rustak branch of the reigning family. I paid the Sultan a visit in Fort Julali, and was glad to find His High ness in fairly good spirits : he was expecting the arrival of reinforcements^on the morrow, and seemed confident of ousting the rebels from the town. Annexures F and G have reference to the question of the occupation by the rebels of the extreme eastern portion of the town with a view to cutting off the Sultan’s communications with the land on that side. I had previously re ceived a verbal communication from Sheikh Abdullah informing me of what he proposed to do, and asking if I had any objection. To this I replied tlnough the Agency Munshi that I could not consent to their drawing the fiie of the Foit down on this quarter of the town, which was almost exclusivelv occupied by Biitish subjects and the Foreign Consuls. After the receipt of my letter (G) the rebels drew back from our immediate vicinity. 9. The first reinforcements for the Sultan arrived on the 17th, the Beni Jabir iiom aO\y. Shortly after their arrival I received a letter ( Annexure H) from the rebel leader, informing me that he had been joined by 400 men, and subse quent information brought me from the town was that the number of the rebels had been materially increased. I received a visit from Sheikh Mohsin bin Amir, who told me the risin'- was a general Hmawi movement with the object of dethroning the Sultan ; on other points lie was very reticent; as to who had prompted the risin' and who them nominee for the Sultanate would he in the event of their success he wouid say notlung. I gathered from him that Sheikh Saleh was close to Matrah with a numerous following. As he was not the principal leader, I deemed it advisable to confine the rest of our conversation to the immediate o yjcc o is visit, which was the occupation of the extreme eastern portion of 7, e J t0 ,T I ! ; - 0n thl 1 pomt } yec 1 ’ 116 * 1 to go beyond what 1 had said to Sheikh Abdullah in my letter of the 16th February (Annexure G) 22, Tl’rouglKmt (Ins interview the Sheikh was profuse in his protestations tint So^ernment deS ' red bUt the WeDdshi P of the°British Further reinforcements came in for the Sultan during the day 10. The afternoon of the 17th February the Wazeer came to me with a message from the Sultan, about which I thought it desirable to go and see His Highness personally. b 018 His Highness wished to know whether I could mediate between him and the rebels and get them to leave the town before damage was done to property and who would be responsible for damage done if he descended from tile fort and tried to recover the town. To His Highness’ first query I replied that I should be happy to afford my good offices when the proper time for mediation should arnve, but that I doubted whether the opening of negoci itions on the basis indicated by His Highness would serve any useful purpose in the present state of affairs as the rebels had as yet received no check, and they had clearly intimated that theii object in seizing Maskat was to obtain the Government; and on the Sultan assuring me that he intended to fight and drive the rebels out, I pointed out to him that any overtures might very likely he interpreted by the rebels as a sign of weakness on his part. In offering my good offices with a view to mediation should an opportunity occur I was aware that I should have to he careful to in no way compromise Government with any guarantee to either side. In reply to the Sultan’s second question I said that only a general answer could now he given, the Government of a country was responsible for the safety of property in its town ; I added that when the rebels first appeared I warned them that they would be held responsible for all damage occurring from their acts, but now they had held possession of the town for five days without any destruction to property, and the situation had somewhat changed. 11. Late the same evening I received a message from Sheikh Abdullah to the effect that Seyyid Saood bin Azzan had arrived and had assumed the func tions of leader, and that Sheikh Saleh was near at hand with a large force and would occupy Matrah that night. A warning was sent to British subjects in Matrah. Threats of occupying this town were frequently made by the rebels after this, hut as a matter of fact no demonstration was made against Matrah, which is of secondary importance to Maskat. The taking of Matrah would have been the first step to the investment of the forts as the Sultan’s supplies would have thus been cut off, and this the rebels would have done had they received sufficient reinforcements to pi ess the attack. 12. Early on Monday, the 18th, an attempt was made hy the Sultan to recover possession of the town, the point of attack being the Ba Sag nr. or several hours there was fighting in the Baniahs quaiters , t ic a ac v on le Bab Saghir finally failed with a loss to the Sultan of 20 men, the number of rebels killed and wounded was never ascertained, hut it was said to be consider, ably in excess of the loss on the Sultan s side.. T ns g ing w ^ &lt; danger to our subjects, for not only was it carried m the streets round tlieir houses, hut both sides mounted on to the roofs and entered the rooms of the Baniah’s houses and fought from house to house. It was time to take immediate steps for the protection of onr people, and this I was enabled to do through the opportune amval of IF J . 1 ■V*.. A sliort™ »•»« “I” &gt;*SSSifS5B » *4S to arrange details, and as I found the \ Arabic letter was about terms and show a disposition ^ ° side ‘ ’ t0 susp end hostilities placed in their hands, calling p c obiect of the truce was from midday to two hours afte r sunset The object of the^^ explained to them, and they were told that thisorder, and that I should commence to remove British subjects from Maskat in half an hour without waiting for replies. I subsequently re ceived an intimation from the Sultan and the rebel Chief that my wishes had been met and acted on. In the meanwhile boats and barges were collected and brought to the Agency foreshore by II. M.’s S. Sphinx's steam launch, and in ^ the course of the afternoon all British subjects were removed from Maskat to safe quarters at Makallah, where they remained in safety till the conclusion of the disturbances. I should not have been able to take this very necessary step had not H. M.’s S. Sphinx been here, for it would have been impossible to collect boats ; also the presence of a man-of-war in harbour added weight to my demand for a temporary cessation of hostilities. I would wish to bring to the notice of Government the service rendered by Captain J. Belly. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, on the occasion, and my hearty .acknowledg ment of the ready and courteous assistance he afforded me in this important matter. To the exertions of Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel A. S G. Jayakar it is due that all our subjects were got out in time. He went about from house to house in the rebels’ quarters, and got out those who through fear or for other rea sons were unwilling to leave their walls, and he subsequently exerted himself to obtain for our people such comfort as was possible at Makallah. Complaints were frequently received during the afternoon of breaches of the truce on both sides, the Sultan’s men being the chief offenders; on the whole it was fairly well kept, and no accident occurred to any of our people. The small European community was accommodated on board II. M.’s S. and at the Agency, where quarters were also found for the Agency and hospital staff. 13. At 2 p. m. on the 18th February you arrived in the li. I. M. S. Law- rence. I proceeded on hoard and informed you how matters stood, and you then assumed the general direction of affairs. Of what subsequently occurred you are fully aware, and you have reported to Government on the position from time to time by wire and letter. It will, however, be convenient to complete this narrative with a short resume of the sequence of events from the time of your arrival to the close of the disturbances. 11. For the next two days but little was done on either side, a desultory cannon and musketry fire being kept up by the Sultan’s men, increasing about sunset. The Sultan received considerable reinforcements, but the failure of Mon day’s attack seemed to have damped the spirits of his followers. On the 21st a slight advance, supported by fire from the forts, was made by the Sultan’s side as far as the eastern gate of the Custom’s house, the rebels falling back slightly in the centre to concentrate their position. Communication with that part of the town occupied by the rebels was now quite cut off, and information as to their numbers and movements was hence forward most difficult to obtain. 15. The afternoon of the 22nd a sepoy of the Marine Battalion, who was on sentry duty over a door on the western side of the Agency, was unfortu nately struck by a stray bullet, coming from the rebel’s direction. It was at first feared that the wound would be a mortal one, subsequently it was ascer tained that the hall had escaped the lung; the patient rallied, and in a few days was pronounced out of danger. Care had been taken to place the sentries so as to avoid risk as far as possible, hut there was not complete immunity from.stray shots at any time in the Agency precincts. After this incident all sentries were withdrawn inside the building, and followers were warned to be careful not to expose themselves, a caution which had been previously given. Complaints were received this day from the Baniahs that their godowns and shops had been looted by the Sultan’s allies, chiefly the Beni Boo All. The TV azeer was desired to meet the Resident and myself at the Agency, and 24«* the chief Sheikhs were also sent for. Suhsennentlv p;„ n- i What was first said to the Wazeer ivas afterwards replated to^ ^Sh^f 1 ' 176 '^ thus, in effect, to the Sultan hi ffl self_that whhe Mends of he Sultan and enemies of none in Oman but friendly to all its neonlp nml ^ ^ , • d to the presence of these Sheikhs and^heir followed to aid theirlufer we 1m peratively objected to the looting of British subjects. The Sheikhs were ternlv warned to restrain their followers from acts of violence, and it was fo c bly pointed out to them that then- boats were entirely at the mercy of our armed force on the sea, and that if British property was plundered by their follower, rt was m our power at once to seize and destroy their boats, and that the doin'- of this might become necessary. They seemed to understand this, and were dismissed in order to make the necessary communications to their followers. Ihe Sultan could give no idea of his plans or of his prospect of success • indeed on these points lie has been singularly uncommunicative throughout. 16. Seyyid Ilarnood bin Azzan arrived at Rui on the 23rd February with 50 men. Hie first complaint was now received of looting on the rebels’ side, and I addressed a letter (Annexui e I) to Seyyid Saood, warning him that if pro ceedings of this kind were not put a stop to, it might become necessary for us to take action. In his reply (Annexure J) Seyyid Saood attempted to excuse the entry of his followers into the Baniahs , temple on the ground that the Sultan’s troops had commenced firing from the tops of the houses, and practically denied that any plunder had been done. When I saw this temple later on, it was wrecked from top to bottom, hut it was then in possession of the Sultan’s men, and it is probable that they completed what the rebels had commenced. Annexure K is an accompaniment to Seyyid Saood’s letter (J). 17. On the 21th February it was reported that 300 to 400 of the Yal Wahibeh had joined Sheikh Saleh at Rui, and that this Sheikh had declared a general war against all Ghafiris in the Sharkiyyak and Jaalan on account of the assistance they had rendered to the Sultan. A long petition was received from the Baniak community, setting forth the hardships and loss of property to which they were exposed by the presence of the rebels, and asking that if the fight could not he stopped at least a cessation of hostilities he effected for the purpose of enabling them to remove their more portable valuables. I had an interview with the Wazeer, who was told that we had been expecting some attempt on His Highness’ part to recover possession of the town, hut that, notwithstanding the fact that he had received all the reinforcements he expected, nothin^ as yet has been done, and it was added that we had a right to ask Ion' this present position was to be allowed to continue. The Wazeer replied that the Sultan was continually urging the Sheikhs to advance, hut without suc cess, and he informed me that a council of war was being held, and that he hoped something would soon be done. 18 The followin' day, the 25th February, the Sultan s forces took the water gate and^heTtower half way between it and the Bab Kabir, and on the left the Beni Boo All advanced their barricades some 50 yards. On the 26th the position appearing as hopeless as ever, you sent for the Wazeer Jnd one ’of hFs Highn^’ councillors to enquire how matters steed, what hopes and plans the Saltan had, and v 10 recorded in the order being restored. The conversation t lat ien P , , j jjis Highness’ form of a memorandum. But little mfoima ion ^ _ U rmn' his forces to representatives; they said that the ‘ SldtaI . 1 p einf , Jent round to the water make a determined move, that reinforce ^ ^ ^ and they trusted gate m view of a combined attack They were dismissed with a mes- some definite result would be s ^ n a ifc would p e a matter of great regret sa^e to the Sultan to the , -j that after more than a to yon if vou were compeM to done, notwith- fortnight of this state of things nothing practically ^standing that large resources were available, to end the deplorable position now existing, and that it was certain this news would be received by Govern- ment with grave concern. The time had now come to demand a clear exposi tion of what we are to expect. It was added that, though not desiring to interfere with the Sultan’s operations, it would be necessary, failing a definite assurance of something being achieved to restore order, for us to insist on a truce for some days to afford opportunity for securing the property of our people. Ilis Highness’ answer being hardly satisfactory, you at once wrote him a letter (Annexure L), to which he replied the following morning (Annexure M). Some days afterwards, at an interview I had with His Highness, he expressed his deep regret at not replying at once in the sense desired by the Besident, the reason being, he told me, that he was dreadfully worried, and had, in fact, nothing to communicate. He complained bitterly of*his allies, especially the Beni Boo Ali, asked me why they would not fight, and said that they had simply come to sponge on him. There can be no doubt that the Sultan’s situation was an extremely difficult one. A letter (Annexure L A) was this day received from Sheikh Saleh, reiterat ing the reasons and objects of the rebellion. 19. Hr. Jayakar’s boat was fired on this afternoon by one of the rebels from a hill between Matrah and Maskat. My correspondence w r ith Seyyid Saood bin Azzan in this connection is contained in Annexures IN', 0 and P. 1 am not inclined to attach much importance to this incident, as Hr. Jayakar was satisfi ed that it was the work of a man who evidently did not recognize our flag. Accidents of this kind, though, must not be allowed to occur, and this was im pressed on the rebel leader and an explanation demanded. 20. A slight advance was made by the Sultan’s forces in the centre, who captured the Baniahs’ temple from the rebels. The Sultan’s position was then east of a line drawn from the eastern gate of the Customs house past the temple to the big Musjid. Beyond this no advance was subsequently made. The rebels held the rest of the town with the exception of the space interven ing between the two sets of barricades. 21. On the 1st March an unfortunate accident occurred. I had occasion to send Peon Othman with a letter to the rebel Chief, which he carried under cover of a British flag, firing having first been stopped at and near the Sultan’s barricade from which he passed, by one of His Highness’ officials stationed there for the purpose. He delivered the letter and received a reply, but on his return he accompanied a Baniah’s servant to the house of his master, and going upstairs was unfortunately shot through the head by a stray bullet. This servant had been allowed to proceed to the rebel Chief to get a safe conduct to the house which the rebels had reported as having been damaged by the Sultan’s artillery some days before. The room in wTiich the peon fell was on the upper story, and no one could be seen in the room for the western shutters were all closed ; the accident was due to chance firing by the Sultan’s men at the houses in the rebels’ lines. There had been little firing this day, and no particular danger was anticipated after passing between the barri cades, and the unfortunate peon had not been instructed to proceed to this house, but merely to make over the servant to Seyyid Saood bin Azzan. 22. I had a long interview with the Wazeer on the morning of the following day, the purport of which I recorded in the form of a memo. We discussed the situation, and the prospects of order being restored. The Waaeer told me the Sultan was much troubled at the want of activity displayed by his allies, who, he was now aware, had not come here with his interests at heart, but on account of the old tribal enmity between the Hinawis and Ghafiris. It was the IV azeer’s firm belief that the tribesmen did not intend to make a deter- 2Gmined assault on the rebels, and that their object was to prolong matter, tt. also told me, not on behalf of the Sultan, that Saeed binAli, one of the HaSi Sheikhs who had always been friendly to the Sultan, was Wing to set peace overtures on foo . The Wazeer thought the rebels were in a'fix^nd Tould be wmmg to come to terms, more especially as the Beni Boo Ali Sheikh had writ! Sultan^ 6 and the Ghafin tribes of the Dhahirah to come and aid the In the afternoon further complaints of looting were made by the Baniahs and it now became necessary to demand a cessation of hostilities for the purpose of enabling them to remove their more valuable property from the town. You recorded a note, the purport of which I communicated to the Sultan in person, which was to the effect that nothing had been done to restore order and secu rity ; that meanwhile anxiety for the safety of British property was increasing and constant reports of plundering were being made; that the position had be come intolerable ; and that there was no other course but to require the Sultan’s consent to a thiee days truce to allow of the removal as far as possible of valu able property, and to demand the same of those opposed to His Highness. It was evening when I communicated this message to the Sultan, who readily gave his consent to the truce. The following day a letter (Annexure PI) was sent to Sheikh Saleh demand ing a truce and desiring the attendance of two of his Sheikhs at the Agency. Reports were received of the looting of rice from godowns of British subjects by the Beni Boo Ali, which it was suspected they had smuggled away in their boats at night. Sheikh Abdullah bin Salim and another Sheikh of this tribe were sent for at the Agency. They denied that their people had done any looting, saying that there were many tribes in this portion of the town. Sheikh Abdullah admitted having sent some bags of rice off during the night, which he said the Sultan had given him as rations for himself and followers. Actual proof against this tribe not being then forthcoming, and his presence being required'with his men to stop their firing, so as to enable the rebels’ representatives to reach us, he was dismissed with a necessary warning. At night Sheikh Rashid bin Uzeiz, one of the Sultan’s leading officials, placed a guard at the Mughab to stop any suspicious bags being removed. 23. The Resident and myself then had an interview with the rebels , represen tatives, Sheikh Mohsin bin Amir and another Sheikh of the llarth. Asked why they had acted as they had done, they said they wished for a ruler on whom all would be agreed. On its being pointed out to them that all the Hinawis were not with them, they replied that they were, although all the tribes had not yet appeared in strength, they were coming, and all had representatives with them. As re gards Zanzibar, thev said they had acted on their own behalf and not on behalf of the Sultan of Zanzibar. With regard to the complaints of looting, they said thev had done all in their power to stop it and restrain their followers, over whom thev admitted they now had not full control. They admitted their responsibi i y for any damage done which they said they would make good. Asked how, they replied that Sheikh Saleh had wealth aad w'OuId gn'e full co^eBsaUon tt th regard to their ohjeets they said they wished to offer Sultanate to tie Sultan of Zanzibar, and failing h,m to one of the sons of Seyyid b “ Kais. Thev were anxious that then- ohjec s as above .^ould be reported W Government by wire and were told m reply that M far nce to shonr representing the general opinion of t e country^her were sma ll and that it was the general wish of the Hmawis, as tnen ^ the Ghafiris outnumbered them 4 to 1. they said tnat me Saleh w r as the wish of the Hinaw is. q P rr V irl Fevsnl They were told that a small number onhem had a^ac pIae ^ who for years had been the friend of . Vj ( { ama ge to British property, into confusion and disorder, am cans J ^ould he regarded as such by Gov- and that this was a most serious matter, and * ouia ernment. 27To this they said that Seyyid Feysal was not a friend of Government, and that they had chosen Seyyid Hamid bin Thoweyni because they knew he was. Asked how it could be presumed Seyyid Feysal w T as not a friend of Government, they would only say that the fact was as clear us the day. 2t. The Wazeer and Sheikh Rashid bin Uzeiz were then summoned, and the terms of the truce were then arranged, the principal of which were :— (a) That the truce should last till two hours after sunset on the 6th instant. {1) That during this period no firing or fighting be allowed in the town by either side. (c) Every facility was to be afforded to British subjects to remove their property and to ensure their safety, for which purpose both sides would withdraw bedouins and others on whom they could not place confidence, from the precincts of the bazaars, and pro per guards be placed under responsible Sheikhs. (d) 'No advance of any kind was to be made by either side during the period of the truce. The next morning early I went round the barricades of each side, and got the leaders to withdraw their followers from the tops of the houses, so as to prevent as far as possible any loose firing and breaking of the truce. I saw to the opening of the Customs house gates which each side was too sus - picious of the other to open. British subjects were then allowed to enter the town, and the work of removing the more valuable portion of their possession commenced. This work went on fairly smoothly for the first day, though complaints were received of obstruction by the bedouins, which were at once referred to the leaders. .On the second day the tension became more acute, frequent complaints were received of obstruction and intimidation, coupled with blackmailing by the bedouins, over whom it was evident the leaders were losing control. A letter (Annexure W) was written to Sheikh Saleh, warning him of the serious consequences of any interference with our people. In his reply (Annexure X) he denied that British subjects had been interfered with, but admitted that he and his followers had fallen short of their duty to us and asked for pardon. Early on the third day a panic set in, and all British subjects left the town and retired to Makallah. The only cause that could be discovered for this panic was a shot fired from the roof of one of the palaces, but doubtless the temper of the bedouins the previous day had predisposed theBaniahsto take fright, and the firing after dark in the town during the period of the truce, which, though contrary to the terms agreed on by both sides, could not be stop- pec , had further tended to diminish confidence. The precaution had been taken before the truce commenced of warning British subjects not to remain in the town during the night. tt- vr- The Wazeer was asked to convey a message to the Sultan, asking if His Highness would agree to prolong the period of the truce; but this His Highness absolutely declined to do, saying he had received further reinforcements, more were on their way, and he hoped soon to be able to make a resolute attack on the rebels position. In reply the Wazeer was told that it rested* with His Highness to incur the further responsibility, if such there could be, of ( eciimng another day’s truce to remove British property still remaining in the town. 0 27. Sheikh Mohsin bin Amir and another rebel Sheikh were then sum moned to the Agency. l^ing 1 asked about violence and threats to our subjects and prevention m the removal of property, they gave vague and evasive answers to this and many questions. I hey admitted that they had ignorant people with them 28venture amongst his tribesmen. ^ had been busily engaged in helping our subjects and in restraining their own followers, and that every British subject who was sent to them was furnished with men to help him in the removal of his property. hhey fully admitted their liability for all damage, adding that the arm of Government was long, and that their property and trade were open to the sea. To this they were told that their property and trade would certainly be held liable, but that their acceptance of responsibility was not sufficient, and that it could not be admitted for a moment that they could come here and do mis chief on the pretext of compensation from their trade. Finally, being sternly warned about mistaking our moderation, that re sponsibility would be sternly enforced-, and that by injuring British property they were in opposition to Government, they were told to convey the tenour of the*above remarks to Sheikh Saleh. C auuve lu oaieu. The Sheikhs intimated that the rebels would leave the town if told by us to do so, but afterwards said that this was only meant as a polite form of speech; that they were ready, however, to go if a show of force were used. 28. By this time the day was far advanced, and it would have been futile to attempt any further removal of property from the town, and perhaps, with the experience of jesterday before us, this would not have been altogether advisable had we had time. Moreover, it was hoped that the more valuable and portable property belonging to our people had been safely removed, and that what remained was mostly rice, dates, etc., in bulk for which no place of storage either at Makallah or on boats was available, and enquiries which were made showed this to be mainly the case. 29. At 4 p.m. on the 7th, having arranged for a short cessation of hostili ties, I proceeded to the Customs house in one of H. M.’s S. Sphinx's boats, and personally communicated to Sheikh Saleh the orders of Government, to the effect that— any union between ^laskat and Zanzibar nas now impossible, and {h) that British property must be respected or else we should have to take active measures to protect it. T idded on behalf of the Eesident that the position contemplated in (i) had practically arisen from their recent acts in looting and impeding the removal of British property. . „ Sheikh Saleh did not deny that damage had been done by his followers, , i-i stre , s 0I1 the fact that damage had also been done by the Sultan s d ,1 To this I remarked that I had met him with reference to matters on people, io this i remarKeu ui . . ; of ^ Sultan’s followers. his side and not with rega f u ii responsibility for all damage done by his Sheikh Salel l ^ e f n „u compensation, and asked, with reference to property be- CSg P to° our suhfects stfli left in the town, that it might be all removed to a ^ W^gard to the ^Som thathefwas not -^^00—^£ “ d Fomise o£ compel1 ' sation could not be accepted as sumuen . nropertv I said that this was As regards the further removal of British propeity, 2.'-^,, tat , ln .ha,»&gt; pi-i. to store further property. third a ays 0 f the 2nd—That. th. *«”“ all.» j 10 * t 1 ''Understanding tliat Sheikh Saleh had nothing further to say in connection with the object of ray mission, I repeated to him the orders of Government to insure his thoroughly understanding them, and then terminated the interview. There is reason to believe that the communication of these orders had a very material effect in bringing on the peace which was concluded two days afterwards, for it was known that Sheikh Saleh latterly had had considerable difficulty in keeping back a portion of his followers, who tired of the protracted war were anxious to return to their homes, and that he had only kept them together by locking the gates and spreading false reports about the earlv arrival of aid in ships and money from Zanzibar. My interview with Sheikh Saleh was held in a narrow street surrounded by bis leaders and tribesmen, and I took care that what I had to say to Sheikh Saleh was heard by those about him. 30. In the afternoon an official of His Highness came on board the R. I. M. S. Lawrence with letters from the Sultan, asking for our active assistance in repelling the rebels. You replied to His Highness the fol lowing morning to the effect that the troubles which had befallen him had caused you much concern, but that you regretted that you were not authorised to intervene in such an internal contest as then unhappily prevailed, and that therefore you were unable to take the action which His Highness sought. You added that you would be rejoiced to hear that these troubles had come to an end (Annexures Q and R). I also annex copies of my correspondence with the Sultan in this connec tion (S and T). It will be observed that in his letter of the 4th March the Sultan made an allusion to assistance from us which could not be taken as a direct request for aid. 31. On the Sth it was reported that another British godown had been brok en into by the Sultan s allies. Sheikh Rashid bin Uzeiz was sent for and a search instituted, which produced a few bales of rice and wheat. Sheikh Rashid was then sent with a message to the Sultan to have a strong party of 20 to 30 men on whom he could depend, placed at night near the Musjid bv the Agency to stop any property being removed from the town; the necessity for a step of this kind had been brought to the Sultan’s notice after the first complaint of looting by his people had been received, and it had been subse quently repeated. Sheikh Rashid was further desired to inform the Sultan that il he could not stop this pilfering and removal of goods, we should have to do so ourselves, which might be prejudicial to His Highness’ interests in the then state of affairs. • SinC ? - the truco ^ iere lla( l ^ een an almost complete cessation of firin' m the town, which was taken to indicate that peace negociations were in pro^ gress. On the mormng of the 9th intimation was received that this was actually the case, and at 5 p. m. an official came on board H. MAs S. Sphinx with a message from His Highness to say that peace was being made, and that he trusted it would be concluded that night; His Highness added that he had delayed giving us this intimation in the hopes of being able to tell us that the war was over, but as his representatives had not yet returned he could not wait any longer without communicating to us the news. Two hours ater the same offic.al came to the Agency on behalf of the Sultan to say that then^t 0 ^ lad beeU SGttlcdj aad tliafc the rebels would leave during His Highness wished British subjects to return to their homes it was known that the rebels had left the gates, but ronffi W ^ 0 ° n aS +fV7 ^ reueis naa iert tne gates, but th could not be permitted.

Seyyid Muhammad bin Turk! was most energetic : both the Agency fire engines had been placed at his disposal, and he was constantly on the scene till the fire in the big bazaar, the most obstinate of all, was finally extinguished on the third day. Fortunately the fire did not reach the more inflammable portion of the town, which is occupied by the shops of the Khoia dty goods merchants, and fears of a general conflagration soon subsided. 34. For the next few days British subjects were busily engaged in set ting there shops and houses to rights, but the presence of His Highness’ allies Mas a constant source oi anxiety and even of some danger, consequently our people returned to Mhkallah at night and did not for some days resume their usual abode in the town, nor -were they able for the same reason to bring back their property which had been removed during the truce till the 17th instant. Frequent representations were made to the Sultan, urging him to dismiss his allies as soon as he possibly could; but this necessarily took time, the claims of all the tribes had to be satisfied by payments in cash, the Sultan’s resources were crippled and there was difficulty in obtaining boats for those who had to return by sea. In view of these considerations and of the fact that this was not a time to consider our claims againt the Sultan and take any action which would further add to his difficulties, you authorized me to continue the pay ment of the subsidy as usual. His Highness’ cheque was presented on the 13th, and the payment then made was of considerable service to His Highness in his straitened circumstances, and helped to disembarrass him of a portion of his supporters. The Beni Jabir and people of Nakl were early sent to Matrah, hut the difficulty of boats delayed the departure of the Jaalan reinforcements; the majority of them had left by the 17th instant, and it is now thought that there are but 200 to 300 left, a portion of whom may be retained for the strengthen ing of the garrison till other arrangements are made; the gates being in the hands of the Wahabis and Hydramis, the Sultan s best men. 35. On the 13th instant the French cruizer Troude arrived from Obok. Yesterday reports were received that Kurryat had been looted by.Kuua, a kindred spirit to Sheikh Hamood al Jahafi; there are only two British sub jects in that place; they estimate their loss at about S 1,000. After leaving Maskat Sheikh Saleh and his forces halted for a day at Bui, where he dismissed the tribes who had espoused his cause. e nen pio^ev.cec on his way to Samad with his more immediate followers, where he is now sai to be. , 36 The number of killed and wounded during this three and half wee vs civil war has not been correctly ascertained. The Sultan must have lost about oi.40 men killed and 60 wounded. It is thought that the rebels’ loss is 80 killed and they are said to have carried away with them 80 wounded when they left the town. This would give a total loss in killed and wounded of 260, probably an outside estimate. With regard to the rebels loss, it must be remembered that the Sultan’s troops used their ammunition freely dny and night for nearly three weeks; the rebels had but little and were careful of it, but their fire was the more effective. Altogether between 500 and 600 rounds must have been fired from the guns of the forts; one noteworthy fact is that the time of each discharge from Fort Julali, which is almost immediately over the Ageney b ul ling, was accurately recorded by the Anemometer supplied by the Meteorological Department. Deports were persistently current for several days at the early part of the war that Sheikh Hamood al Jahafi had been mortally wounded and had suc cumbed. Perhaps unfortunately for the future peace of Oman these rumours proved to be unfounded. 37. The attitude of the rebel chiefs towards us was satisfactory through- out. They came as they said to rule and not to loot, and their acts were in accordance with their words. For the first few days of the disturbance when the town was wholly in their hands, not a complaint of robbery or theft was received, and their arrangements for the protection of life and property left no thing to be desired. In my dealings with them I found them anxious to meet all my wishes, and on more than one occasion they assured me that the tribes of Oman desired nothing but the friendship and support of the British Government. It was not till the 11th day of the occupation that any robbery took place on their side, and thenceforward it was apparent that the tribesmen were becoming impatient at the protraction of hostilities, and getting more and more out of hand. Later on the tension increased, and finally ended in general pillage and destruction. For this the leaders are of course directly responsible, and this responsibility they have admitted, though it was not accepted by us as sufficient. That the chiefs were unable to control their followers is no excuse whatever for the violation by the tribesmen of British property, a fact which our interests will require us to demonstrate to the offending tribes in a forcible manner. The Sultan has abstained from giving us any information as to the terms which the rebels exacted from him as the price of their withdrawal. They are believed to be— (a) The payment of a cash sum variously estimated at from §12,000 to $17,000. (&amp;) The continuance to the leaders and the Rustak family of the allow ances they formerly enjoyed. (c) Forgiveness for past acts. It is possible that His Highness may have felt some natural distaste to al luding to such unfavourable conditions. 38. The above is a narrative of events connected with the rebellion. On the subject of the political situation, the question of compensation to our subjects for loss of property and other matters incidental to the rising, I shall shortly address you separate communications. With regard to damage to British property I may now say that from all I can gather, and making allowances for reports which may have been exaggerated, the total loss may perhaps he put down at one lakh of dollars; but this estimate cannot be re garded as conclusive, and I doubt if our subjects are yet aware of the exact amount of their losses. Trade is now beginning to resume its wonted course, and a certain amount of confidence has been restored. 33. It would be difficult even in the pre-Islamite days of ignorance to find a parallel for the dastardly act of treachery which has been perpetrated by 32Sheikh Saleh and his subordinates on their Sul ton TLn +1 07 -i •, tioned in the beginning of this narrative T • ! r ?

The causes of the rebellion may be said to be three (1) The weakness of Seyyid Eeysal’s rule and his unfortunate policy of bolding aloof from the tribes and allowing their quarrels either to adjust themselves or to be settled by the more powerful Sheikhs. (2) The restless ambition of Sheikh Saleh, which, dormant for some years, had been excited by the reception bis son and other Sheikhs of bis tribe received at the bands of the Sultan of Zanzibar during their visit to his capital last year. (3) The comparatively defenceless state of the town against such a coup as that which effected its capture. The garrison was below its normal strength, and most of them were living outside the walls. Against an open attack, however, Maskat could have held out till reliefs arrived despite the small number of its defenders. The causes of the failure of the rebellion to effect the declared object of its leaders were also three:— (1) The rapid rallying of the Ghafiri tribes to the succour of their Sultan. (2) The fact that the movement had not the full support of the most im portant Hinawi tribes, who were not all devoted to Sheikh Saleh’s cause. (3) Dissensions amongst Sheikh Saleh’s more particular adherents and an absence of community of interests. A. Dated 13th February 1895=17th Sbahban 1312. From— Major J.

We hope for an answer in what ever way you like as is the custom, and to such a tenour that our interests will not be affected injuriously. We have good hopes in you, and salaam. 6th Ramazan. T. Dated 4th March 1895. From— Major J. Hayes Sadler, Political Agent, Muscat, To—His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. After Compliments.—In acknowledging the receipt of your Highness* letter of this day’s date I have the honour to say that I personally went round the advanced posts held by your Highness’ men and those opposed to them, this morning, and desired both sides to come down from the roofs of the houses in accordance with the 4th condition of the truce which uas entered into yesterday. In no way have the positions held by your Highness men in the streets been altered; they are all at their posts and round the houses only, not above; it would be far from our desire to do anything prejudicial to your Highness’ interests, but the conditions of the truce must be observed by both sides. All the action we have taken is in the interests of British property and to stop indiscriminate firing. 39Sheikh Saleh has asked that the truce be observed outside the town as well as inside. We are answering to the effect that the conditions of the truce were fixed yesterday, hut that we see no objection to what he proposes if he can arrange it with your Highness. u. Dated 7th March 1895, .From—His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, To—The Political Agent, Muscat. After Compliments .—I have the honour to inform you that on the 6th Ramazan (=4th March 1895) I sent you a letter and gave a hint that I hoped you would pay attention to and avert the great calamity which has befallen us and the subjects of the great British Government from these rebels, for we know that Government will not be pleased with what they have done and the favours and mercy (of Government) towards us have ever been great, of old and recently. You have not replied to this, and now wo shall be glad of an answer. This is what it was necessary for us to write. y. No. 15. dated 8th March 1 10th Ramazan 1312. From — Major J. Hates Sadler, Political Agent, Muscat, To —His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. After Compliments .—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Highness’ esteemed letter of yesterday’s date in which your Highness asks for our assistance in repelling the rebels. On this point the Political Resident is replying to your Highness. But with regard to that portion of your High ness’ esteemed letter of the 6th Ramazan to which you observe I made no reply in my answer to that letter, I would wish to explain that I did not understand your Highness to make therein a definite request for assistance, but rather to have expressed the hope that we would have interfered from the first on your behalf. I shall regret much if I have misunderstood Your Highness* meaning. I shall be very happy to hear that these troubles are drawing to a close. Dated Muscat, 5th March 1895. From— Major J. Hayes Sadler, Political Agent, Muscat, To— Sheikh Saleh bin Alt. It has been reported to me that some of your men have tried to prevent British subjects removing their stores of rice and dates. Take care that no obstruction is put in their way in this matter j if British subjects are in any way impeded in the removal of their goods, the consequences will be serious. X. Dated 5th March 1895. From— Sheikh Saleh bin Alt, To—The Political Agent, Muscat. After Compliments .—Your esteemed letter has been received and is under stood. We have allowed all your subjects to take all their property away. We have fallen short in our duty towards you, and we ask for pardon. What belongs to your subjects must of course be removed in accordance with what you have said, and salaam. Written by your slave Saleh by his own hand, 40 G. C. Press, Simla.—No. 31 F. D.— 22-4-95.—70.II Enclosure No. 21. No. 22, dated Bushire, the 13th April 1895. From— Colonel F. A. Wilson, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of previous correspondence, I have the honour to forward, * No. 67, dated 28 th March. for the information of Government, copies . t Apr ‘‘ . . of two further reports* from the Political Agent, Maskat, on the situation there. 2. It is satisfactory to note the indications that the Sultan is alive to a sense of his obligations in regard to the restoration of order and confidence, the repair of injuries in and about the town, and the strengthening of his own position, and that, though from a knowledge of His Highness’s character, no special vigour or ability in these matters was to be looked for, measures have been taken. It will be seen also that His Highness has taken the opportunity quietly to restore the scales at Mutrah, the ill-advised removal of which had been the subject of a report some time ago. This and other signs may I trust be taken as indicating an improvement of His Highness’s attitude towards us. 3. The malady in his neck, from which the Sultan suffers, is of consider able standing, and it is to be regretted that ill-health is added to his present difficulties. No. 67, dated Maskat, the 28th March 1895. From—M ajor J. Hayes Sadler, Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent and Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report that no further complications have arisen since vou left Maskat this day week. Confidence, however, has not been restored as quickly as I should have wished or indeed as should have been possible had the Sultan taken more energetic measures towards this end. It is unfortunate that he keeps the small party still left of his allies in the town instead of quartering them outside, also that parties from the interior are apparently allowed to enter and remain in Maskat as before the war, for instance, oO of the Masakirah arrived on the 26th and are still here. As I have pointed out to His Highness that precaution would seem to require that no armed parties be allowed to enter Maskat without his express orders, but His Highness evidently fears to assert himself.. 2. Two cases of interference with British subjects were reported to me on the 26th one of which was accompanied by threat. I sent for the Wazur, had the complainants up before him, and sent him with a message to the Su a 4 to whom I also wrote a strong remonstrance. The Sultan sent for the Sheikhs and spoke angrily to them, telling them ihe Sultan sent io Hipn .„ p i ves anc L him. Since this there have of'histT’mefinThetLaaJs. “and as but few of his allies are left be should have no difficulty in keeping Most of the refuse and 3.

Sheikh Saleh and his followers of the Harth have reached Ibrah. Reports from that quarter are to the effect that their return was marked more by mourning than joy owing to the losses the Harth suffered during the war. 6. The scales were re-opened for the weighing of dates at Matrah on the 25th instant. I have received no official intimation of this, I trust it may indicate a desire on His Highness’s part to avoid useless causes of friction for the future. 7. In the interior matters are quiet. The rebels have all dispersed to their homes, and there is considerable anxiety amongst the tribes as to what move our Government will make. No. 73, dated Maskat, the 4th April 1895. From— Major J. Hayfs Sadler, Political Agent and Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in Persian Gulf, Bushire. Everything has been quiet during the last week. There is no disquieting news from the interior, and so far there are no signs of the late disturbances in Maskat being followed by outbreaks in other portions of His Highness’s dominions. All those connected with the rebellion are believed to be in their homes. 2. In Maskat the signs of the late catastrophe are wearing off, con fidence has in great measure been restored and business in the bazaars is being carried on much as usual. Some apprehension is still felt of a possible return of Sheikh Saleh and his followers, but this is merely bazaar gossip and is not believed in by those best informed. Repairs are being made to the city walls and the work of hoisting the 12-pounder guns into Eort Merani is in progress, though tempo rarily stopped by the giving of some masonry on which the crane was resting on the top of the fort. 3. On the 2nd instant I paid a visit to His Highness and asked him if he had any communication he might wish to send to you through me by this mail; he said that at present he had nothing of importance to communicate. I regretted to observe that he was much troubled with the sinus on his neck, he has been poorly ever since you left, probably the after-effects of the worry and trouble he has lately passed through. Talking about the exaction of reparation from the rebel tribes, the Sultan did not volunteer any expression of his wishes as to the specific mode in which this question should be dealt with; I gather that he awaits the orders of Government. He told me that there would be no difficulty in the matter as the rebel trade must pass through Maskat or Soor. On my reminding His Highness that he had always had difficulties in recovering his own dues at the latter place, he said that matters could be arranged through the friendly Ghafiri tribes. The Sultan told me he had sent to the Hydramnnt for 200 more men to strengthen his garrison, and that he was thinking of enlisting more Wahabis. I expressed my gratification at the precautionary measures which were being taken and said I hoped he would not omit to put Matrah in a proper state of defence, and I trusted that he had the means of procuring immediate information of any suspicious movements in the interior, to which His High ness replied that, God being willing, all would be well, that his people are on the look-out, and that one must not look to what has passed, things are changed now and that could not happen again.From No. 1065.E. The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, To The POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Simla ) the 29 th May 1893 . Sir, I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter marginally noted, No. c, dated the 21st March 1895. enclosing copy of a full report by the Political Agent, Maskat, on events con nected with the late rising in Oman. 2 . Details as to compensation to British subjects, for loss occasioned to their property during the disturbances, cannot probably be settled until the work of the Committee now sitting to investigate the various claims is finished. Meanwhile the Government of India approve of your view that reparation should be exacted from the offending tribes in the form of a tax to be levied on their export trade, and that a demand for this should be made on the Sultan. 3 . Direct action against the tribes, such as that taken in 1879 , a ft er Sheikh PVrfe correspondencs ending with the letter from Salih's attack On Mattrah, should be the Government of India in the Foreign Depart- • i i i . • • r i ,. , . . ment No. 309 -E.P., dated the 18th February 1881 . avoided | but in V16W 01 the slight authority exercised by the Sultan over the tribes who rebelled against him, and in order to assist him in recovering the tax he will be called upon to impose, His Highness may be authorised to notify in distinct terms to the tribes concerned that his demands upon them are made at the instance of the British Government for acts committed by the tribes against the property of British subjects during the rebellion. 4 . At the same time His Highness should be given clearly to understand that his responsibility as Ruler of Maskat in the matter of making good the losses of British subjects is in no way lessened by the fact that the Government of India consent to the levy of compensation in the manner indicated. 5 . Should you consider early action desirable with a view to the recovery of a portion of the indemnity during the present year, the Political Agent may intimate to the Sultan the decision at which the Government of India have arrived in time to admit of the issue of the notification to the tribes and of the imposition of the tax before the coming date season opens. The rate of the tax may be settled by His Highness in consultation with the Political Agent, on the principle that it should be sufficient to produce in two, or at the most in three2 years the probable amount of the compensation to be awarded. The draft of the notification should be seen and approved by you before it is issued by H.s Highness. 6. I am to add that should the Sultan show a disposition to evade the ouestion or fail to take effective measures to secure the realisation of the tax, he may be warned that, in the event of his arrangements to exact reparation from the tribes proving unsatisfactory, it might become necessary to recover the amount of the compensation from the Zanzibar subsidy at present paid to His Highness. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. J. CUNINGHAM, Secretary to the Government of India. G. C. Press, Simla.—No. 288 F. D.—30-5-95* S°-45 Enclosure No. 23.

N „ o T 7n £ on 1 ' uatl ° n of coriespoDdenoe ending with your endorsement Iso. 370 E. dated the 18th February 1895, and with reference to the 7th paragraph of my letter No. 5 A of the lath March, I have the honour to for- Confidential No. 7 o, dated 2 nd April isos. ward, for the information of Government ” ® opies ?! the 1 , etters noted » the mar gio’ .. ,, . . from Political Agent, Maskat, re garding the instigation of the recent outbreak there from Zanzibar. 2. The action of Sheikh Saleh bin Ali, in organising and heading the outbreak, is a sufficiently forcible comment on his undated letter, which formed an enclosure to Mr. Hardinge’s Confidential letter No. 254 of 24th October 1894, received in the correspondence under your endorsement No. 55E. of 7th January 1895. Put if the account now given by Seyyid Bedr bin Seif is true, it is difficult to understand how such a letter as that communicated to Mr. Ilardinge by the Sultan of Zanzibar could have been written to His Highness by Sheikh Saleh. No. 70, dated Maskat, the 2nd April 1895 (Confidential). From— Major J. Hayes Sadler, Political Agent and Her Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. You are aware that at one of our interviews with the Sultan, he expressed bis belief that the recent troubles in Maskat were brought about by the Sultan of Zanzibar and Sheikh Hilal bin Aamir, one of his chief officials, and * 01 , in support of this view, His Highness Sheikh Mohsin bin Aamir. laid stress on the visits ot the three* sheikh Hamood ai Jahafi. Sheikhs to Zanzibar last year, the cordi ality of the reception accorded them, and the large presents, including muni tion of war, they received from His Highness Seyyid Hamid bin Thoweynee, on the fact that these three Sheikhs were the leaders of the rebels at the outset when Maskat was seized, and that Sheikh Mohsin is a brother of Sheikh Hilal bin Aamir. 2. It will also be remembered that at my first meeting with Sheikh Mohsin, he was very reticent as to who had prompted the rising, and on a subsequent occasion when he was asked by you whether Sheikh Saleh was acting on his own behalf or on behalf of the Sultan of Zanzibar, he denied that they were acting under orders from Zanzibar. And vet their first nominee for the Sultanate in the event of their success was His Highness Seyyid Hamid bin Thoweynee. 3 I have since heard from Seyyid Badr bin Seif, the Sultan’s General, who was made a prisoner in his house by the rebels before they seized the cites that the dav after Sheikh Saleh arrived in Maskat he went to his house fnd tried to cet Mm to join his side and take part against the Sultan, and tka at riiis interview ^informed Seyyid Bedr that the rebellion had been ordered i ifnn nf Zirizibii’ from whom be had received several letters before the^tlirwrs^heikhs^vent to'zanziba'r, all to the effect that Seyyid Hamid bin Thowevnee wished him to rise against Seyyid Feysal; that he matter was finX arranged whilst the three Sheikhs, one of whom was Sheikh Saleh s son, finally ai ran,,ea wui tQ attack s yid jw sa i in an y way they coni 1, were at Zanzibar, they ‘ _ S pledging himself to bear the cost by sending and Seyyid Hamid bin Ihoweynee piea 0 m sheik h Saleh received a f tt'r^from l his )n soi ia telling n hini*the , agreement had been concluded and that !fhe\sbe^h Saleh) did not’accept, the Sultan of Zanzibar would find someother instrument. That thereupon he (Sheikh Saleh) accepted the agreement and commenced his plans which ended in the seizure of Maskat. Seyyid Bedr bin Seif further tells me that at the same interview Sheikh Saleh informed him it was the intention of the rebels to kill Seyyid Fevsal, that Saleh was to manage the affairs of the country till a ruler be sent from Zanzibar or one appointed from thence from the A1 Bu Saeedis now in Oman, further that he (Sheikh Saleh) had told Seyyid Saood bin Azzan that he would only be a Wall on behalf of the Sultan of Zanzibar, and that if he did not like the position he might return to Bustak, that this position was accepted by Sevyid Saood, and finally that Sheikh Saleh told him (Seyyid Bedr) that if he did not succeed in dethroning the Sultan on this occasion he would return again and again. No third person was present at this interview. 4. At a visit which I paid the Sultan this afternoon, he again alluded to the connection of Zanzibar with his late troubles and told me—what I Had previously heard through his Wazir—what had been said to him by Sheikh Saeed bin All, one of the Harithi Sheikhs, whom the Sultan has always con sidered attached to his interests, on the occasion of the first visit this Sheikh paid him when peace negotiations w r ere in progress, which negotiations the Sheikh w 7 as mainly instrumental in starting. What the Sheikh then told His Highness was to the effect that he had been induced to join the rebels partly under false information given him by Sheikh Saleh that the Sultan had been killed, and partly by Sheikh Saleh threatening him that it would go hard with his property in Zanzibar if he held back. I may mention here that it is generally believed that, as soon as the rebels had seized Maskat, Sheikh Abdullah bin Saleh WTote a letter to his father telling him they had killed the Sultan, and asking him to hurry up with reinforcements as quickly as possible. It is, moreover, doubtful, whether Sheikh Saeed bin Ali would have joined the rebels except under some kind of pressure, for he w T as not on good terms with Sheikh Saleh, who looked upon him as a possible rival in the tribe, and it was one of Sheikh Saleh’s grievances against the Sultan that His Highness had been trying to undermine his authority with the Harth by the support he had accorded to this Sheikh. 5. In a matter of this kind it is always difficult to get direct proof, but taken altogether there are grave reasons for questioning the part taken by Zanzibar in the late rebellion in Oman. Here it is generally believed that that rebellion was directly incited from there. If the account given by Seyyid Bedr bin Seif of what Sheikh Saleh told him is correct, there would be a strong probability of documentary evidence being still in the latter’s possession, though it is not easy to say how Sheikh Saleh could be induced to produce it.
