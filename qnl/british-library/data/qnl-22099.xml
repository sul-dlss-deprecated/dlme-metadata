Filet 004.1 Dear Sir, We attach hereto two copies of the draft of the Annual Report for the Bahrein Government covering Company activities at Bahrein during the year 1949. The report follows the same general pattern as used in recent years. The figures given on shipments of products during 1949 include only Marine bulk: shipments and package export shipments, the details being obtained from the first two sections (Export Bulk and Export Package) of the B-205. Total Crude runs listed are net Crude (i.e. runs plus stock transfers shown on page 1 of the B-200.) In the Summary of Personnel (Tabulation IV), we have included the British and South African members (12 men) of the European Refineries start-up team, in our Refinery Personnel totals ainee we expect these men to return to our organisation shortly. In the cause of Dollar Payroll employees, which include Messrs. Croecy, Turner, Bartlett, 0*Keefe, Pollard, Awgun and Langdon, we have excluded them since their return is considered improbable. The map which ia required to accompany the jarinted copies of the report has been brought up to date in pencil by the copy attached hereto. With this copy you will be able to make the necessary revisions to the cloth transparency now in New York. # We are holding a copy of the draft for transmittal to His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent who, we anticipate, wi ll make his usual request in the near future in order to compile his Annual Administration Report.

ConMer T&gt; VTTT? i T’NT ^ _ _ANNUAL REPORT OF THE VICTORIA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL FOR 1940. CHARGE. The charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital ties held by Colonel J.D. Grant throughout the year except for a leave peroid Stool 27th August to 24th November when Colonel W.J.Moocfy* acted. DUTIES. The duties of the Medical Officer are now chiefly those in connection with Quarantine work and in addition he looks after the Residency and Agency staffs and the employees of some local business firms. HEALTH CONDITIONS. The general health of the group catered for was quite good. The sunner months wore not as trying as those of last year and as a result such conditions as heat exhaustion # boils,prickly heat and gastro - intestinal infections were not so common. There was however the usual crop of coraoon colds # bronchitis * asthma and influeazaL conditions during the winter months. DISEASES. Nothing of an epidemic nature occurred. There was no case of Smallpox although the disease was more or less endemic amongst the local population. The cases of venereal disease reported were chiefly seen amongst the crews of oil tankers* freighters and other vessels calling at Bahrain. VACCINATIONS. There was a marked increase in the number of vaccinations performed and in addition to the figures shown, the hospital staff cooperated in the mass vaccination drive organised by the State Medical Officer in the early months of the year and for which no records were maintained. BUILDINGS. The Menistxy of works has assumed respon^Hity on a short term basis for the repair and maintenance of the hospital building. However nothing much is being done as funds are very limited. The building is very did and it would require a considerable expenditure to keep it In a fit state of repair. With the arrival of household equipment, the Q.M.O* s quarters are now more comfortable but the water supply based on the Heath — Robinson principle, is a constant source of worry, the electric wiring especially in damp weather a public danger and there are no air conditioning arrangements.

This arrangement is proving most successful and in supervising dhow traffic, it provides a long required necessity in quarantine duties. It by passengers and crews of dhows arriving here from other ports in the gulf. The Sitra dispensary has worked very smoothly during the year. The daily attendance there of the uarantine Medical Officer makes quarantine supervision and the medical attendance on ships' crews much easier. With the closing down of the Marino Airport in Novenber,Kuharraq is carrying out the quarantine woric very efficiently but in due course it will be necessary for either the Customs or Passport Officer of Bahrain Government to assume these duties. Island wide immunisation, freedom from insect vectors, would effectively prevent epidemics of Cholera, aaallpox, Typhus fever etc. should such infections be introduced through evasion of the frontier quarantine control.

The bheikh has proved reluctantly amenable to influence on ropst points on v;hich representations have been made to him, and has agreed to the appointment of an Adviser, the establishment of a branch of the Eastern Bank at Doha, and the opening of an office by Messrs. Gray Mc Kenzie. Preliminary talks have also been held with rep resentative^ of Mssrs. Cable and Wireless about the open ing of a telegraph office. He had not, up to the end of j le .y? ar teen induced to bring the country's financial or administrative affairs into any sort of order, and there is no accounting system or attempt to plan expenditure. All reforms of this nature are postponed pending the ar rival of the Adviser. &amp; The Sheikh's position in the country is not cnallenged by any individual of group, bit nor is his control particularly effective, and uie absence of oppo sition indicates xr a lack of governmental action ratner than any real unity of purpose. ±2x Finances. Since taking over an empty coffer in August, the Sheikh has received an advance of 4 lacs from the Oil Com pany, on account of royalties. He has also had monthly payments from the Company for Customs Dues, wages of guards etc., of between 30.000 and 40,000 rupees. The Doha Cus toms have yielded about 20,000 rupees a month, and there have been other miscellaneous incomings. All this has been spent, and a further advance from the Company was sought. JJhen it was made clear that d such an advance could only be made if a budget was prepared and the Political Officer supervised expenditure, the Sheikh dropped the reauest and borrowed from the Darwish instead. He is thus spending at a rate of well over 20 lacs a year, and perhaps very much more. It is not likely that his first year's royalties, after deductions for ad vances, will reach 30 lacs, so that his income during the next year, on which so many greedy eyes are fixed, will not permit as marked an increase m nis rate of expendit ure as is commonly anticipated. Security and Public Order . .£3. No threat exists to the state of Qatar from outside her frontiers, and public order within them is reasonably good. There xdt is a marked absence of violent crime. Stealing from the Oil Company, smuggling and slave trading are national industries in which the ruling family are as deeply involved as anypne, and with which the Gov ernment is ja unable or unwilling to interfere. 14. Soon after his accession, the Kuler agreed to employ a British police officer and to establish a proper police force. On 3rd September, Mr K. Cochrane arrived in Doha on loan from the Bahrain State Police, and began this work. The Ruler's enthusiasm for the scneme was only luke-warm however, and continual pressure had resulted by the end of the year^ an a poorly clad, underpaid force of &lt;30 men, not yet sufficiently trained to perform ordinary police duties.

There has been a noticeable increase in tuberculosis and particularly in the number of cases that have come to our hospitals from el Hasa and Riadh. In regard to venereal diseases, our hospitals treat fewer c ases since the government hospital has estab lished V.D. Clinics, but we note that the patients who do come, have learned to come in the early stages of the disease, rather than, as formerly, when it had pro gressed too far for any hope of cure. We have no figures bearing on malaria but there has been a remarkable decrease in the last four yea rs. Yours very truly, .

ROYAL AIR FORCE. 1 $ The R.A.F. transport command detachment was maintained at Sharjah throughout the year with an average strength of oneOfficer and 50 O.R.S. Command v/as held variously by Flight Lieutenant J.R* Atkins, Flying Officer, F. Dagnell and Flight Lieutenant R.J.F. Dickinson. Flying control at Sharjah has nov/ passed to International Aeradio Limited but the airfield continues to be maintained by R.A.F., and Air Ministry personnel. 6. U.S. NAVY.

During the period under report 43 ships called at Sharjah and 80 ships at Dubai. 9. ANTI-LOCUST ViORK. On 26th January a Pakistani anti-locust team under Mr. H.M. Abbas arrived in Trucial Coast. After carrying out a brief survey in the Coastal areas, the team operated control measures in March against locusts which were breeding in the Marmoum area 35 miles South East of Dubai. Mr. R. Waterston, S.R.S.E., arrived in Trucial Coast on 21st April to study the situation and on 3rd April Mr. G. Popov of Desert Locust Survey arrived to take charge of operations. The work was hindered throughout by lack of adequate transport and funds4 and 'by the opposition of the Ruler of Dubai to the use of poison bait in his territory. The Pakistani team finally left for Karachi in June. As a result of the experience gained in the spring, it was decided to despatch to Trucial Oman in the autumn a Control Unit and a survey team of Desert Locust Survey both administered by East Africa High Commission. On 9th November, Mr. G. Popov arrived in Sharjah to organize the winterfe compaign. He will be assisted by four British Officers and is adequately provided with vehicles and equipment for extensive survey and control measures. The intention of the Survey Unit is to penetrate the interior of Oman as far as possible and to obtain detailed topographical information and to study locust breeding, whilst the control unit j.s to deal with swarms in the Coastal areas. Mr. R. Stephenson, P.R.E.S., director of Desert Locust Survey, Nairobi, arrived m Trucial Coast on 6th December to study local condxtious aua xeiu on 15th. 10. PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT IKUCIAL COAST LIMITED. Througnout 1949, the Company continued its detailed exploratory operations in the area of tne Jebei Ali and of the sands immediately fringing the Abu Dhabi Sabkha. A rapid seisimic survey was also made uii tne Coasuai strip between Dubai and Umm al \|aiwain. In darly August, an unloading camp was established on the shores of Khor Ghanadah, a creek in Abu Dhabi territory capable of harbouring not merely launches, but also the Company^ landing ship, S.S. Jassura. At this camp, vehicles, 3 tores and equipment were landed anti a drilling camp was established at Ras Sadr, some 10 miles South Wexst of Ghanadha. By the end of the year, the foundations of the drilling rig had been laid and drilling is expected to begin before the spring of 1950. Considerable difficulty was experienced by the Company in setting up these camps firstly on account of the inhospitable terrain and the extreme heat and secondly, throughtrouble with the labourers recruited in Abu Dhabi. There were numerous strikes in the early stages, due, it is believed, partly to deliberate trouble-making by the Kulmg family of Abu Dhabi, who attempted by this means to persuade Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, to renounce their claim to the Abu Dhabi sea-bed oil rights. 3y the end of the year, however, the rig had reached a height of 50 feet at operations were proceeding smoothly under the direction of Mr. K.M. Maude. The operations at Sadr employ about 15 Europeans and 300 locals. The Company's Representative in Trucial Coast was Mr. H.M. Jackson until 17th June when he was relieved by Mr. B .P. Henderson, (See also under heading of various Shaikhdoms). 12., C^HTKAL MINING IKVESTMSW TRUST AND SUPERIOR PIT. Hn. On 5th March the late Sir Hugh Weightaan K.C,X.E. # representing Central Mining Investment Trust arrived in Trucial Coast to explore the possiblity of obtaining on behalf of his Company and Superior Oil Concessions from the Trucial Shaikhs for the areas of sea-bed which might accrue to them, on 9th March, accompanied by Mr, Woods of Superior Oil, he visited the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and from that time until August, held frequent discussions with the t.ae Rulers of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, Ho concessions were signed, largely, it is believed, because the Shaikhs, whose appetites had been whetted by the large payments promised . en ^ to Kuwait by American Independ/Oil Company in 1948, made quite impossible demands for royalties. Following Sir Hugh 1 s death in October, Lieut. Col. A.C. Galloway, C.I.S., 0.B.E, , visited the Trucial Coast on 6th December to re open negotiations on behalf of Superior Oil Company who are now believed to with to obtain the concessions for them selves alone. On 16th December, Mr. Smith of Superior Oil Company visited Abu Dhabi in this connexion. Superior Oil Company appear to have no competitors for the Trucial Oman sea-bed.6 12 9 Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Co* Iron Oxide continued to be mined on Abu Musa and Sir Bu Uai’r islands during the year and 2500 tons v/ere exported to the United Kingdom from Abu Musa and 2200 tons from Sir Bu Nai f r. Strikes occurred amonget the labourers during Aprilt but were not of such a nature as seriously to interfere with the Company’s programme, and firm action was taken by the Shaikh of Sharjah against the ringleaders. Mr. E. Innes Pocock was in-Charge of the mines until 17th May when he left for United Kingdom whence he returned on 12th November. On 3rd December, Mr. Pocock, accompanied by his Sharjah Agent, Khan Sahib Hussain Amad, proceeded to Abu Dhabi to try to obtain from the Shaikh a concession for mining iron oxide within his territories. The Shaikh demanded and guarranteed royalty of 100,000 Rupees per annum, a sum which the Company could not hope to pay, and as yet, no concession has been signed. 13. MEDICAL. (See Appendix A) 14. MESSRS HOLLOWAY. IROTHPRS (LONDON LIMITED). In November, the Ruler of Dubai granted Messrs. Holloway Brothers permission to operate as constructional engineers in Dubai, and a store has already been erected in Dera by the Company’s resident representative, Mr.J. Lindsay. On 13th November, Mr. Peter Holloway, a Director visited the Trucial Coast and called upon the Ruler of D^bai• 15. INTERNATIONAL AK^ADIO LIMITED. Plying control at Sharjah airfield has now been taken over from the R.A.F. by International Aeradio Ltd. During the year, Sharjah airfield handled aircraft, an increase of sn over the previous year. A consider able increase of traffic resulted from the refusal by the Governments of India and Pakistan to allow DutchI - 7 machines to use their airfields during the Indonesian ■war thus obliging aircraft hound for Indonesian to refuel at Sharjah or Bahrain. Mght landing facilities v/ere improved during 1949. A strike lasting tvo days took place among the Indian and Pakistani employees of International Aeradio Limited. After tv/o days, foliov/ing an assurance by the Company that their grievances v/ould be rectified, work was resumed. Mr. E.J. Palmer was Station Superintendent until 10th November when he was relieved by Mr. R. Helm. 16. GOVPKNHBNT OF PAKISTAN METEOROLOGICAL STATION SHARJAH. The station was closed on 2nd March, and its func tion taken over by R.A.F. 17, m. W. THSSIGEK. D.S.O. Mr. Wilfred Thesiger, the traveller, arrived in Dubai in April from the interior of Oman. During the spring he had succeeded in penetrating as far as NEZWA and at one time, even enjoyed the Imam 1 s protection. After spending the summer in United Kingdom, he arrived back in the Trucial Coast on 23rd November, leaving for Buraimi after a few days in Dubai. 18. KINBRAL RIGHTS IN SEA-BED OP THE TRUCIAL COAST. In 1949, all Trucial Coast rulers having a sea-codst on the Persian Gulf, issued public proclamations declaring the sea bed lying off their shores to come within their jurisdiction and control. Whilst navigation fishing and pearling rights in those waters are unaffected by such proclamations, the Rulers claimed rights over minerals which may be found in that area of the sea-bed and subsoil. Dates of proclamations were: (a) Abu Dhabi 10th June (bj Dubai 13th June (c) Sharjah 16th June (dj Has al Khaimah 17th June (e) Umro al Qaiwain) &amp; Aj man ) 20th June19, THE SLAVS TRATSK. Action was taken against the Shaikhs in two particularly glaring cases of enslavement in 1949. On 24th December 1948, Shaikh Rahma bin Abdurrahman, Shaikh of Hera, a dependency of Sharjah, was reported to have seized and sold to the bedouin three of his subjects, all free persons. Shaikh Rahma refused to come to the Agency to give an account of himself, and vhen a sworn statement had been taken from one of his subjects exposing the Shaikh 1 s complicity in the affair, the Ruler of Sharjah was called upon to intervene with force. On 21st January Sharjah guards occupied Hera remained in occupation throughout the year. Shaikh Rahma spent the year as the unwelcome guest of various Trucial Coast rulers. following reliable reports in March of kidnapped persons having been taken to Saudi Arabia as slaves in launch 'JOKhR» belonging to Shaikh Rashid of Dubai, this vessel was detained in Bahrain at the request of the xditical Agent and its crew arrested. The Ruler of Dubai disclaimed all knowledge of the case, but there is excellent reason to believe that his daughter Mbzah and the sons of his brother Juma f h had carried out the whole business with hiscannivance. Whether the action taken m these two cases and the enquiries made in numerous others have had an effect upon the Trucial Coast rulers, it is difficult to judge, but the number of enslavements reported to the Agency during the year steadily declined and during the second half of the year, only 2 fresh cases were reported and both victims were restored by the intervention of the Rulers. 20. DUBAI-ABU DHABI BODITDARY. The two rulers having agreed to submit to H.M.GJp arbitration over the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary, in 1949 the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, examined the rivalclaims and recorded the chief landmarks within the disputed area upon a map. a comprehensive report was submitted to the Political Agent, Bahrain, on the 2nd April, and on 30th 13ay, the Political Agent announced to both rulers his decision, which was a line running inland from Kas Hasian, a headland roughly midway between the two towns through wells of Ghafur and Hafir to the well of A1 Eshush. 21. SCOHOHIC. During 1949, prices in general dropped and control of piecegoods and wheat was abolished as the free market product began to undersell the controlled product. As from September, Egyptian rice purchased through the Ministry of Pood began to arrive and to be distributed through the Dubai and Sharjah Pood Companies. This rice was of better quality and cheaper than the rice hitherto available in the free market. ougar, allocated under the United Kingdom control scheme arrived in large quantities. 22. THE YEAR'S EVENTS WITHIff THE SHAIKHDOMS. (a) Sharjah. Negotiations for the new Sharjah Air Agreement were opened in February and agreement was reached on many points but further progress was prevented by the grave # illness of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr who was flown to Bahrain and subsequently Bombay on 10th March for hospital treatment. The Shaikh*s health is reported to have improved of late, but he is still in Bombay and his brother Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr is acting for him. / The travel ban imposed on Sharjah in 1948 was lifted on 8th February 1949. On 27th March Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr paid a further R$. 15,000/- to Mihammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin as the Beni QitaVshare of the payments received by Sharjahfrom the Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, ne also paid protection money to the notorious robber luvairish, but still failed to guarantee the security of his vehicles using Jebel Fayeh road. The Ruler of Sharjah has asked Messrs. Holloway Brothers to survey Leia point and to submit an estimate for the construction of an artificial labour for dhows there. He hopes thereby to increase the prosperity of Sharjah whose creek has been steadily silting over the past few years. (b) Dubai. Dubai vehicles using the track to the Batinah via the Fayeh Pass, were frequently attacked early in the year by robbers, including Tuwairish. When later the * Ruler provided escorts for cars, security over the route improved. In December, the Ruler of Dubai, after some hesitation agreed to give a site on the South back of the creek for the construction of an Agency, Office and residence in Dubai to replace the existing building in Sharjah which is inadequate for the purpose. He had previously given a site for a hospital in Dera on the opposit shore. The Rulers eyesight continues to deteriorate, and in December he brought an eye specialist from Bombay to advise as to treatment. It is feared, however, that nothing can be done to improve it. (c) Abu Dhabi. In April, exploratory parties of the Arabian American Oil Company, entered Abu Dhabi territory without the Ruler*s permission and reached a point about 25 miles North East of Abu Dhabi town. Camps were also establish ed in the region of Has Sila at the Western extremity of Abu Dhabi territory. On 22nd April, the Political Officeraccompanied by Shaikh Hazza of Abu Dhabi, visited Sila and there found the Americans encamped under the protection of a Saudi Amir Haiyif and some armed Saudi guards# On 23rd April, an unfortunate incident took pXace in v/hich the Saudis disarmed tv/o Agency guards and detained the Political Officer for some hours. When the Agency rifles v/ere eventually restored the Political Officer and Shaikh Hazza returned to Abu- Dhabi and thence to Bahrain and reported v/hat had occured, to the Political Agent. This matter, together with the general question of the Saudi-Abu Dhabi boundary was taken up with the Saudis at governmental level. AH Saudis and ARAICO personnel had been with drawn from the area by the end of April. The Ruler of Abu Dhabi, anxious to grant a sea bed concession to Superior Oil Company has informed the Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, that he considers their existing concession covers the land only, a condition with which the British Company cannot agree. Although he has been called to arbitration under the terms of his concession, he has so far failed to nominate an arbitrator. Partly on account of the bad relations between himself and the petroleum Development (Trucial \ Coast) Limited and partly through suspicion of Dubai, Shaikh Shakhbut tried in October to prevent the entry of Dubai dhows, chartered by the Company, into Khor- Ghanadha. The Political Officer having informed him that the Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited were entitled, under the terms of their concession to employ such craft, he withdrew his objection, but later tried to impose a tax upon them. In June, the Ruler received a loan of 4 lakhs of Rupees from P.C.L. much of this sura is believed to have been spent on consolidating his position in Buraimi.12 Has al Khalmah. The weakness and poverty of the ruling family and possibly the intrigue at long range by Sultan bin Salim have been at the root of a number of disturbances in Bas al Khaimah in 1949. I In April Sai’d fel Badi of the Bidah tribe, assisted by the Shaikh of Rams rose against Ras al Khaimah. Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad, against the advice of his father and brothers arrested him and put out one of his eyes with a hot iron, a futile action which only served further to aggravate the situation and as a result of which the Shihuh tribe also rose against him. Eventually, the Ruler of Dubai, who owns valuable properties in Ras al Khaimah, arranged a settlement between all parties. A further but minor dispute arose in October between Ras al Khaimah and the Shaikh of Jazirat az-Za'ab and again, with Bakha.v 111 November, a section of the Khawatir tribe under 'Ali bin Obaid kidnapped two Ras al Khaimah women as a means of trying to extort money from the Ruler. The lion’s share of the annual payment made by the Shaikh to the Khawatir appears to have been made to the other section under Saif bin Ali. A settlement was eventually made through the mediation of the Ruler of Umm al ^aiwain. Ajman. The Ruler made several journeys into interior Oman with the intention of extending his influence over the Kai’m tribe. His avowed intention, so far unfulfilled, of murdering his cousin Saqr bin Sultan, Chief of the Nai f m, has now become the local joke. Uiam al .jaiwain. During 1949 Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid gave valuable service on numerable occasions as mediator in local disputes. Kalba. Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah continued to be in charge in Kalba in the 'absence of Shaikh Khalid the Regent.23. BRITISH BANK OF IRAN AIID MIDDLE EAST DUBAI. (Formerly Imperial Bank of Iran) Mr. M.P. Stott was manager throughout ths year and Mr. L.J. MaCleay arrived on 30th November to take over duties of accountant. The Bank f s business increased considerably in 1949 and sales of Sterling for the purchase of British goods increased to 7 times the 1948 volume. Payments to Indian accounts remained at the former level of about fc. 200,000 per week. Cash was plentiful throughout the year, and the Bank seldom encountered difficulty in obtaining payment of Bills. The Bank acted as agent for the British Ministry of Food for the procurement of the Rice quota. A change in the Bank's former title Imperial Bank of Iran caused confusion with the Iranian National Bank and did not indicate the present layout of the Bank's branches, *may of which now lie outside Persia. Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah*13&gt; Medical APPENDIX A The year is to be regarded as satisfactor from a Public Health point of view. The climate did not reach its extreme heights. Maximum temperature was 116 with a Humidity of 82. Rain appeared in early November, reputed to be consid erably earlier than usual. There was complete absence of Acute Infectious Disease. No case of Heat Hyper-Hypexia was recorded and very few of Heat Exhaustion. The absence of gastro-intestinal diseases such as dysent - ery in anything approaching epidemic propertions, in view of the entire lack of sanitation, the very considerable fly nuisance, and the primitive water supply is really remarkable. No case belonging to the enteric group has been treated. Ascaris Lumbricoides infection is very common. Malaria: This disease still heads the list. There has been a considerable decrease in-the number of cases in comparison to last year. There is strong evidence to support the contention that the disease is largely imported from outside, chiefly from Muscat Area and Iran. The local vector has not as yet been ascertained. The Spleen Index (Dubai) has not been accurately ass essed as yet, but a considerable number of children examined suggest that it is not high. Malignant Tertian appears to be the commonest type of infection. There is little or no evidence of malarial cachexia. Venereal Diseases: Syphilis in all its forms is very common place. There are many cases of tertiary Syphilis, chiefly cardiovascular and gummatous infiltrations.Of the dozen or so cases, presenting chronic synrp- tons hut not gross clinical lesions and in most cases no history, where the olood'has been sent to Bahrein for Kahn Test; in no case has a negative result been received. The treatment of such cases is particularly difficult, as no patient will undergo the necessary prolonged treatment. The prevalence of syphilis among the population is further supported by the number of miscarriages and still-births. Diseases ..of the eve:- The number of cases of cataract is very considerable, though a great proportion are not suitable for operation. When better facilities are available good work may be undertaken in this line. Dispensary:- The years attendance v shows a slight increase. The number of women attending is calculated as between 20 to 25$ of the total. Children constitute a considerable number in addition. By providing a degree of purdah by means of curtains this result has been achieved and there is evidence that the number of women is steadily increasing. Theie is considerable variation in attendance throughout the year, depending on such factors as the pearling season, •Shimals* etc. Towards the end of the year the Dispenser, who had been working for a considerable number of years, left. The lower grades were up-graded, which arrangement is working satisfactorily Quarantine:- The number of ships shown as granted pratique without boarding was largely due to the fact that while the assistant M. 0. was a©ay on leave fpr t^ree months it was not possible to board as most ships arrive here during Dispensay hoars. A new arrangement has been recently commenced for in coming Dhows.

During the year under review the Government spent Rs 66 lakhs on buying food for the people of Bahrain y in the previous year only &amp; 31 lakhs were spent on the purchase of food. The increased expenditure was on sugar and rice, quotas of which had been asked for by the Government and received through His Majesty's Government. During the months of Saffar, Rabia alAwal, and Rabia alThani, prior to the arrival of Government quota sugar, the Government were fortunately in a position to check the somewhat inflatory tendency in the free sugar market by issuing a small ration of 2 lbs per adult per month for the townsfolk of Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd, and J lb per adult in the villages, from a reserve high priced stock at a subsidised rate of &amp; 1.9.0 per ruba of 4 lbs. ( The free market rate which had risen to Rs 2.4.0 per ruba returned to Rs 1.12.0 per ruba). The 1949 quota sugar duly arrived in mid Jamad alThani and commencing with the month of Rajab and continuing through the remaining months of the year, a sugar ration of 3 lbs per adult in the towns and £ lb per adult in the villages was issued at a rate of Rs 1.8.0 per ruba. Rice 1 As in the case of sugar, prior to the arrival of Government quota stocks, prices in the open market rose far beyond the means of the poor and working class people to Rs 4.8.0 per ruba of 4 lbs. Commencing with the month of Shaban, the Government issued a ration of 6 lbs Egyption rice per adult per month throughout the State at a rate of Rs 1.6.0 per ruba of 4 lbs. For the month of Ramadhan 8 lbs per adult were issued, in Shawal and till the end of the year, 6 lbs per adult per month were issued, at Rs 1.6.0 per ruba of 4 lbs. The fact of the Government having and issuing low priced rice had a salutory affect on the free market, rice prices tumbling te from Rs 2/8 to Rs 3/* P«r ruba.In addition to tha per capita wheat ration a number of licensed bakers in Manamah, ttuharraq and Hedd were Issued with wheat at the scale of 4 lbs per head of the adult population for mar ing broi»d| which was sold to the public at controlled prices and weight. Here again with the arrival of large stocks of flour, bakers found it more economical to buy flour, then to buy controlled price wheat and then pay milling or grinding charges on the wheat* teg i Due to an abnormal cool summer and the prevalence of dust stwrrr.s it soon became apparent that there would be a very poor date crop during the year under review* The Government received numerous petitions from Tenants of Date Gardens complaining that the cropa would not be sufficient to cover the rent paid to the owners. Accordingly the Government appointed s comrittee to visit all the gardens irosi where petitions had been received, and assess the loss* An overall loss of approximately $9 was assessed by the committee and after reference to His Highness it was decided that the total loss assessed would be borne by the owner of the garden* It was learnt that in katlf and Iraq, similar poor crops had been realised, so naturally owing to the scarcity, the price of dates rose steeply* Bahrain dates (murssbsn) rose to &amp; 340/- per galls, as compared to te 180/- per galls last year, whilst Basrah dates were selling at to 2f/- per retell of 84 lbs* As dates are one of the main staple diets of the poor and working class people, this state of effelrs was s cause of ^rave concern to the Government whose sole concern was to endeavour ensure that essential foods were available to the public at reasonable prices* At a meeting of the Food Control Comitiittee held towards the end of the Arabic Year, it was decided subject to His Highness the Ruler's permission being obtained, to allow the import of dates into Bahrain frse of all Customs charges for the first three months of 1369# In addition barter su^ar at a price of to 30/~ per bag of- 4 - of 224 lbs, would be given to date Importers at a scale of 10 bags sugar for each 1000 baskets (ratells) dates imported. His Highness's sanction to this proposal was quickly forthcoming and the public informed by Ehlan accordingly. At the time of writing this report, I am able to advise that imports of dates are good and the prices have fallen by 5QJ6 , and the poor &amp; working people are again in a position to buy their requirements of this commodity. As a result of barter sugar being once again available to the Government, there were plentiful supplies of meat available throughout the year. Fish supplies during the year were again well short of requirements and several cases of selling fish in private houses at prices higher than the controlled rate, were successfully prosecuted in the local Courts. Contributory causes for the shortage of fish are, the ever increasing European and Indian population, increased air traffic through Bahrain, and the decrease in the number of fishermen. Steady employment can readily be obtained ashore. Efforts are be^ng made to Induce merchants to use more launches for fishing in the coming winter, the one launch used last year made a steady income. Increased supplies of Fresh Vegetables and fruits were available during the year at prices a shade cheaper, than those of the previous year. As anticipated it was possible to abolish cloth rationing during the year under review. Cotton, artificial silk, silk and woollen piece goods poured into Bahrain throughout the year from the United Kingdom, India, China and the U.S.A* A considerable quantity of Japanese piece goods were also imported into Bahrain from the free port of Aden. The piece goods market became overstocked and the public were able to buy most types of this commodity at prices well below the controlled rate.Towards the end of the year a market was found for longcloth and mulls in Pakistan and Afghanistan and considerable quantities of Japanese, English and Indian types were sold and shipped there. The Bazaar was heavily stocked throughout the year with all types of consumer goods, but prices, and in particular those of cars, radios, cycles and gramophone were again approximately 10£ higher than in the previous year. The increase was at the source of supply, and not local. Stockists of fancy goods, such as Jewellery, ivory goods, Kashmir carved woodwork, Gold embroidered handbags and belts, watches, cameras etc,, did a brisk business throughout the year amoungst the visiting crews from vessels calling at Bahrain, and the employees of nearby Oil Companies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, FOOD CONTROLLER,PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED BAHRAIN SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS FOR 1 Q4Q 1. ^atar (a)Wells &amp; Drilling Confidential Six more wells were spudded in during the year brought in during the same period and one well left tion. , and six for observa- Well No. Spudded in Brought in Remarks DK 8 DK 6 12.10.1948 18. 1.49 Observation well DK 9 1. 2.1949 11. 5.49 as from 1/2/49.

Strict quarantine regulations were enforced on the passenger traffic between Bahrain and Qatar. There was one death from meningitis among the Indian personnel and another Indian* employed as a barman at Umm Said, was electocuted whilst filling the refrigerator. Barring a few occasional cases of chicken-pox and mumps infectious diseases have been absent, A Resident Medical Officer is posted at Uram Said and a new hospital is nearing completion. Two cases of Tuberculosis have been under treatment at mkhan - one from Aden and the other from Trucial Coast. Employees from these regions are- recruited through Doha and it is not possible to arrange for X-ray of chest locally, as is now done with recruits from India and Pakistan. Consequently isolated cases will probably continue to elude detection at medical examina tion on joining. On the whole, the sanitation in all camps and the health of all classes of employees has been good during the year. 2. TRUCIAL COAST A seismic survey, begun in November 1948, was continued until June 1949. The area covered was from Jebel Ali southwards to Has Sadr and inland to a depth of several miles; seismic surveys on a small scale were also carried out in Dubai territory, north of Jebel All, in Sharjah territory along the Wadi al Qor and Dhaid tracks and in the Umm al Quwain shaikhdom eastwards towards Falaj al Ali.4 - Seismic operations were begun again in September 1949 southwards and south-westwards from Pas Sadr. Preparations to establish a drilling camp of one string at Ras Sadr were begun in August 1949, Khor Ghanadha being used as the port for the import of the necessary materials. A hydrographic survey in connection with the use of Khor Ghanadha as a. port was a so carried out. Drilling is expected to start early 1950 c A marine survey of the islands of the Abu Dhabi shaikhdom took place in the spring of 1949.

TELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS EASTERTIDE. with reference to your Confidential letter No. c/L-32 of 14th ultimo, we give below a brief summary of working conditions for the year 1949. MONEY Money was not so plentiful in the bazaar as in the two previous years. It is believed that considerable funds went to Saudi Arabia in payment of dollars purchased there and for the establishment of credits in non-sterling area countries in Saudi Arabian sterling. Large transfers of funds to Kuwait took place in the last quarter of the year for the purchase of gold and Pakistan notes. EXCHANGE Exchange rates remained stable throughout the year for all sterling area currendies with the exception of Pakistan Rupees which were not devalued in line wiih other sterling area cuerendies when the £.sterling was devalued in terms of the U.S.Dollar in September. Following the appreciation of the Pakistan rupee in terms of other sterling area currencies, a brisk traffic developed in Pakistan Currency notes, most of which were smuggled out of Pakistan for sale. The purchase and repatriation of Pakistan currency by the Banks in Bahrain ceased on 31st October on the State Bank of Pakistan's refusal to give the Banks credit for any currency notes purchased after that date though the traffic still continued in Saudi Arabia until 22nd January 1950. otherwise. The 'free' dollar rate rose to Rs,5/l5/0 per dollar towards the end of the year but dropped to Rs.5/8/0 at the close. TRADE Not quite so active as most sections of the bazaar were well stocked throughout the year, with pieoegoods overstocked with very little demand. The position in piecegoods was eased somewhat in October when Pakistan buyers appeared and demand from Arabia revived but the Mpsket remained 'sticky* Devaluation of sterling in terms of the U.S. Dollar had little or no effect Yours faithfully.c^&gt; i TELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS, 'bactria” iqtfc No.L/6t/824 H.

Percentage of Cash to Immediate Liabilities. January 1st. 39.91.000 51.46.000 20.83.000 51% December 31st. 61.42.000 77.99.000 22,35,000 70% ■Je handled an increasing amount of business on account of the Bazaar and companies such as the Bahrain Petroleum Co. who now appear to divide their business about equally between the Eastern Bank ltd. and ourselves. We were able to render considerable assistance to both the Eastern Bank and the Company m the closing months of the year, when an acute shortage of Rs.10 notes became apparent. It was impossible to obtain supplies from India, and for a time we were the only source of supply on the island. We also flew in 15 lakhs of notes from our Branch at Kuwait to assist the position. Our operations with our branches at Kuwait, Dubai and Muscat have shown a continued increase. In the case of Kuwait v/e have to face quite considerable competition from the Bazaar brokers who use passengers travelling by the almost daily air services between here and Kuwait for shipments of bills and notes, and this oxten appeals to the bazaar as a way of avoiding payment of Bank commission. The bazaar has been very active and large quantities of goods have been imported 'in transit'. In many cases this means that the eventual destination is Iran or oaudi Arabia, but in view of Bahrain's long established position as a distribut ing centre for goods en-route for Qatar, the Trucial Coast ( and formerly Dubai) it is difficult to see how a distinction can be drawn between transit goods for- 2 - Scheduled territories and others. The 'free” dollar market was very active indeed in the early part of year when large sums were spent on development by the Arabian American Oil Co. in Dhahran, and also in view of the lack of banking facilities there, Aramco nad to purchase their requirements of i&gt;audi Rials from Merchants and brokers. The Banque de l»Indochine opened in Alkhobar in April and for a time increased the supply of fis, but in the later months of the year, the amount coming across to Bahrain has considerably decreased. It seems likely that stories that the Saudi Government is considerably in debt - in #s - to the Banque de I’Indochine may be true, as they seem somewhat prodigal in their spending. We have been able to assist the Bahrain Bazaar to sell increasing amounts of consumer goods - and luxuries - to the week end visitors from Saudi Arabia, as we have continued to accept for the credit of ''free' ft accounts, the large numbers of notes spent in the bazaars. We believe we are right in saying that we are the only place in the Persian Gulf where^ notes are accepted. The greater part of these notes have been repatriated to Alkhobar and put into circulation again over there, and this has enabled the turnover of trade to greatly increase. ^ After the partition of India when free transfers between India and Pakistan and vice-versa were forbidden a considerable business was built up by smugglers in bringing notes up to Bahrain and either taking gold back or merely arranging the transfer required through one of the Banks here. Both Banks were buyers of Pakistan notes, at a discount sufficient to compensate them for having to repatriate the notes to Karachi and transfer funds from Karachi to London and thence to Bombay. This question of a discount did not please the Pakistan Govern ment and after several months of correspondence they sent a representative to visit the Gulf Shaikdoms. He was amazed to hear of the extent of the transactions, and shortly after his return to Karachi some slackening off of the business becameapparent, possibly because of stricter control on passengers leaving Pakistan. Devaluation of sterling and the Indian rupee, caused another sudden increase in the number of Pakistan notes reaching Bahrain, but it seems probable that many of these notes were brought across from Saudi Arabia where they may have been spent by the hundreds of pilgrims who passed through Bahrain by air at the start of the Haj. All repatriation of Pakistan notes was stopped by the Karachi authorities as from October 3 1 st, and this business thereupon ceased. During the period January 1st to October 31 st we bought and repatriated to Karachi over Rs.40,00,000 in Notes of all denominations. The ’'Parcel Post” business handled by this Branch increased enormously and we have often had as many as 60 parcels of all shapes and sizes delivered to us at one time. This method is chiefly used by merchants ordering small quantities of light or valuable articles such as drugs, watches, fountain pens etc. and the system in force here is of great assistance to both merchants and the Banks. Immediately on arrival the parcels are delivered to the Banks and the Customs are advised, when the collection is paid the consignee takes the parcel to the Customs and opens it for inspection and payment of the relative duty. This method obviates the delays usually experienced when the Customs authorities take over all parcels and the Banks and/or merchants have to find out for themselves if the parcels have arrived or not. Business with India has continued to increase and we are now receiving bills from the majority of the Banks established there. Whereas a year ago the weekly number of rupee bills reaching us was 20 - 25, in the last months of the year the weekly figure was never below 60 and on several occasions reached 80. Many of the documents indicate clearly that the eventual destination of the goods is Saudi Arabia and up to about the middle of the year, such exports were not permitted by the Indian Control.- 4 - •■/hether it is that they wish to boost exports or that a blind eye is being turned in some oases is impossible to judge, but we have noticed that certain merchants seem to be 'luckier' than others. Work on our new office continued, but delays in delivery of materials gradually slowed down the already slow progress and towards the end of the summer work practically ceased. The visit of a member of the firm of architects appeared to instill new life into the contractors and the tempo again increased. Delivery was to have been not later than December 31st, but it now seems likely that March 31st, 1950, will be the earliest possible date. The new Manager's House has been started and it is hoped that similar delays will not occur. We are not over optimistic, as Holloways appear to have taken on far more work than their limited native labour force can manage, and there seems little hope of their being able to recruit many more. Future prospects for thd Bank in Bahrain appear good and the increased business w., are handling has necessitated considerable increase in staff, British, Indian and Bahraini. We now have 4 British Officers and 10 Indians as compared with 2 officers and 2 Indians last year. We have made every effort to recruit Bahrainis but the standard of education appears to be so low that few are suitable for employment as clerks. Arrangements for the opening of our new Branch at Alkhobar (the first British Bank in Saudi Arabia) progress slowly but favourably, and we shall be opening to the public on February 1st, 1950. Business between Bahrain and Alkhobar will be a little 'difficult' owing to exchange control regulations, but we hope that the establishment of a Bank there will enable the sterling area to benefit, if only to a small extent, from the dollars and other hard currencies which are available in Saudi Arabia, and which now all gravitate to the 'free' or 'black' markets of the Middle East.

Epidemics* Smallpox broke out suddenly in December which was rumoured as brought in from Saudi Arabia. The infected area namely Horn in Manama was vaccinated by organised parties from house to house. Other large areas. Schools, and special departments were also done. Working in with t- ! e quarantine department, a special vaccinator was loaned for a short time for daily vaccinations of all incoming people from ships and dhows at Manama which helped as an effective brake against further infection. The Quarantine Staff were also tightening their regulations which will prove a valuable future safeguard. Lt : Colonel W.J. Moody, The Chief Quarantine Medical Officer of the Persian Gulf,has clarified the position regarding internal and external contagion, on the strength of which the Bahrain Government took over complete charge of the Quarantine Island and this will be brought more up-to-date. Total vaccinations done were 17868 which together with those of the Lady Medical Officer’s department totalled 22049 which is the highest number recorded in one year. Despite this. Smallpox dwindled on sporadically for most of the year and though not serious is nevertheless a potential minor menace. 85 Patients were quarantined. Items of Special Interest . Chloromycetin was used for the first time in Bahrain in October. It is claimed to be a cure for the Typhoid group of fevers. Six patients were treated, five of moderate severity and one moribund. All were cured in the five to seven days stated. Its success is therefore outstanding, and this drug ranks next to Penicillin as one of the discoveries of the age.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. FractuInjuries, reached the high figure of 580 of which 147 'ere admitted to hospital. These were largely the outcome of road accidents and building hazards, which call for greater safety. The Laboratory and X-Ray Department have expanded their work. Biochemistry, cultures, and Widals have furthered diagnosis considerably. Plans for a larger laboratory are in hand complete with modern fittings and this should be in use by next Spring. Lines of Development will be; - (a) A Public Health Department run by a British medical officer. All the work of preventative disease will then be consolidated under this head, including town sanitation and a school medical service, (b) Increasing medical aid to the villages. Pulmonary Tuberculosis , A small sanatorium block of six beds was built and opened in May. Each room has the maximum light and air with a broad netted verandah. The building is laid in a garden. 32 patients were admitted this year and isolation under such con- -ditions it is hoped will give more promising results. Malaria. A total of 1^46 patients were treated which were 100 more than last year. At the seme time 1500 more general outpatients were seen this year, so proportionately the general level of infection remains the same, which is a little over 6%. Malaria has ceased to be a menace in the towns and European infection is uncommon.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. Venereal Disease &gt; There was a drop of 310 on last year’s figures, a total of 977 being seen. Total positive Kahn’s tests were 1065, also 300 less. The new scheme of free compulsory treatment has had an effect and large numbers of prostitutes received very intensive courses of treatment by The Lady Medical Officer. The onus of the work has largely fallen on her. Results have been encouraging, and the only difficulty will be maintaining this work on a high level of effeciency. Certain foreign pros’bitu'fces were deported# Summary of the year # Good progress has been made over partly controlled Venereal Disease. A T.B. block, four new private wards, a Women’s Isolation Hospital, and a large Indian Staff block were put up during the year. Dysentery of the bacillary type showed a higher incidence. Typhoid was a little more prominent, and Smallpox broke out in epidemic form# On the whole a good year with an increasing standard of health led by the schools. The hot weather was not severe.

His Excellency the Political Resident Persian Qulf, Bahrain. 'es.aent,ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BAHRAIN AGENCY INCLUDING THE TRUCIAL COAST AND QATAR FOR THE YEAR 1949. 1. general. The year was one of steady progress in Bahrain helped by the increasing availability of supplies for building and of machinery from the United Kingdom. The local administration maintained its excellent record as that of the model State of the Middle East. The major question with political implications concerning the oil industry was the division of the sea-bed. In Qatar the starting of operations by the Iraq Petroleum Company and concession hunting by the Superior Oil Company of Cali fornia sud^suly brought that barren peninsula into pro minence. On the Trucial Coast oil Company operations were also commenced in the wastes under the control of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. In the hinterland kidnapping for slavery, robbery, and other crimes were almost as prevalent as they have always been in the past. 2. AL KHALIKAH . (a) His Highness Sha itth Sir Salman bln Hamad A1 Khalifah. K. C.I.E., Ruler . S' His Highness the Shaikh maintained good health, his steady record of progressive administration, and (except over the Zubarah question) friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government and the Political Resident and the Political Agent throughout the year. In May he celebrated the marriage of his eldest son, Shaikh Isa bin Salman, aged 21 years, to the daughter of Shaikh Salman bin Ibrahim A1 Khalifah. In November he paid a visit to Kuwait in H.M.S. ’’Wild Goose”, accompanied by his brother Mubarak bin Hamad Al Khalifah and three notables of Bahrain. He stayed there for three days. He thought it incumbent on him to return the visit which His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait made to Bahrain in June. 0&gt;) Shalkh-Mohammed bin Isa Al Kha lifah. C.B.E .. uncle of His Highness . As usual, this old man was on the move at various times during the year. He visited the United States in March in order to see his son Hamad (who is studying at Stanford University, California) and to have his teeth attended to. His visit cost the Bahrain Petroleum Com pany Limited, who found themselves let in for paying for it, a great deal of money and reduced one of their officials who accompanied the Shaikh to desperation. Soon after his return from the United States he left for Syria and the Lebanon in June for a change, and in October he visited India for medical treatment. He left for Cairo in De cember and did not return till the end of the year. He was made an honorary C.B.E. in June. (c) Shaikh Abdullah bln Isa *1 Khalifah, junior uncle o f His Highness . Shaikh Abdullah married as his fourth wife a young girl of 18, the daughter of Saiyid Ibrahim of Hidd township in the island of Muharraq, on the 29th of January. He left ...-2- left for the Haj (pilgrimage) with a party of 80 persons in two special ’planes sent for this purpose by His Majesty King Ibn Saud in September&gt;and returned in October. In November he visited Saudi Arabia for hunting and hawking and returned in December. (d) SfraiKhs Abdullah. Amaad and D»M 1 . half. brotners of His Highness . All these three Shaikhs went to Amara (Iraq) for a hunting trip in December and did not return till the end of the year. (e) &amp;hai*h Kh allf&amp;h bin Mohammed A1 Khalifah . gon of Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa, anfl the Superinte ndent of Police . Shaikii Khalifah, accompanied by his brother Shaikh Salman, visited Amara (Iraq) for a hunting trip in November. They arrived in Basrah without visas on their passports and the Mutassarif had to intervene to enable them to land. They were eccompanied by 30 men including one instructor of the Bahrain Police, and took with them 3 motor vehicles, guns and a large quantity of ammunition. (f) All frlp A-pflulIfah, eldest son of Sheikh Abaullah bl n Isa A1 Khallfah . This Shaikh was sentenced to confinement to the island of Muharraq and to payment of a fine of Rs.4,000/-, and his driving licence was confiscated by his father and the Adviser to the Government, sitting as Judges*of the Bahrain Court for being drunk and assaulting a Roman Catholic priest, in May. He was set free in June as a result of the intercession of the Ruler of Kuwait on his behalf. 3. EDUCATION . hoys . More classrooms were added to some of the schools. 300 new boys were admitted. In Muharraq however there is still a large waiting list. The standard in the schools compares very well with standards in similar schools in the Middle East countries. Ten Palestinian teachers were added to the foreign teaching staff. Three boys were sent to the Beyrout University for higher edu cation and two of the senior local teachers were sent to Nottingham University for doing a one-year course in English and methods of teaching. G3rls. A British Nursing Sister has been appointed by the Medical Department to visit the Girls Schools re gularly. The usual Needle Work Exhibition was held at the Ghudhabiya Palace, and the standard of the work exhibited was high. No. of Schools in existence on 1-1-49 .. 17 No. of Schools opened in 1949 No. of Schools closed in 1949 Number of Students on 1-1-49 .. 3727 Number of Students on 31-12-49 .. 4211 4 . mismim- The Agriculturist-in-Charge of the Budeya Garden resigned during the year. Arrangements are being made to ..to obtain tha services of a British Agriculture Adviser, One Mr. Forsyth offered to take up the appointment but had backed out. Sir Herbert Stewart, formerly of the Imperial Institute of Agriculture, Pusa, visited Bahrain in March at the invitation of His Excellency the Political Resident to advise on the possibilities of agricultural development. He was able to examine most of the cultivated area of the island, including the Government Experimental Farm at Budaiyah and met a number of officers of the Bahrain Government. 6. MUNICIPALITIES . The usual routine work in sanitation, town clean ing, road repairing, etc., was carried out. Owing to the poor state of the finances of the municipalities, much of the road repairing work inside the town was done by the Public Works Department. 6. WATER CONSERVATION . His Highness appointed a committee in February consisting of Mr. R. Godfrey, the Chief Geologist of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz bin Hasan al Gosaibi, Haji Majsur al Irrayyidh, Haji Isa bin Saif al bin Ali, and Haji Abdullah bin Muhammad to examine all applications for the digging of water wells in the island. His Highness himself took the chair at the first meeting of the Committee which was held in March. It is feared however that considerations other than water conservation often influence the Committee in their deal ings with applications for the digging of much prized new wells. 7. PUBLIC WORKS . The new Government Offices in the Customs Square were completed in June and almost all the offices of the Bahrain Government, except the Adviserate, were moved to the new premises. A building to house the British Nursing Sisters, the Women’s Isolation Hospital and a block of male wards in the Government Hospital were completed during the year. The Manamah water supply scheme was completed by the Contractors and taken over by the Public Works Department. 8. ELECTRICITY DEPARTMENT . Mr. Donald Brammer remained as State Engineer throughout the year. The Power Station building was ex tended to almost twice its original size and one 300 k.w and one 360 k.w. generating sets were installed. The installation of one 360 k.w. and one 850 k.w. generating sets was commenced and the construction of a large water cooling tower and pond was completed in July. At the close of theyear the total installed capacity of the station was 1360 k.w. The H.T. line on the causeway to Muharraq was replaced by an under-ground cable. Three new sub-station buildings were completed in Manamah andextensions to two existing sub-stations were commenced.. Orders were placed for new switch-gear, transformers and cables in order to carry out a scheme of efficient trans mission and distribution in the coming year. A new meter testing room was completed and started operations under the direction of a well qualified Foreman. Units generated during the year totalled 20,66,864 and the peak load car ried was 620 kilowatts. 141 new consumers were connected bringing the total number of consumers to 2238 at the end of the year. Mr. J. Hudson was appointed Assistant State Engineer in April. The supply of the electricity has been maintained without any major interruption through out the year and many improvements have been effected to the supply voltage in certain areas of the distribution net-work. The cost per unit to consumers was reduced considerably. 8 . « This system, serving Manamah, Jufair, and Muharraq, and maintained by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited, was opened on 1st March. Initially 300 subscribers were provided for and at the end of the year installation of additional equipment for another 300 subscribers was com menced . io. m skim- The number of boats which went diving during 1949 season was 83 compared to 69 boats last year. The catch was poor. The pearling industry, with all its harsh unremunerative toil for those employed in it, is dying - and a good thing too. One Mr. Lieberman, a United States pearl merchant, whose own company is associated with the United States firms of Jacques Bienfeld Incorporated and the Sea Gems Company, visited Bahrain in October to study the pearl market. He said that the Bahrain merchants would not sort the kind of pearls he required for sale in Europe and the United States so that he was obliged to buy packets of which he could only use about 10$. The remainder would have to be re-imported to Bahrain or exported to India. n. 1A BB A 3UL H8H8 M M - An increasing population and the drawing off of fishermen into other avenues of employment have made for an acute shortage of fish in Bahrain. Fish forms the staple diet of the poor, and His Highness wrote to Alexandria for advice regarding the type of vessels, gear, etc., which could be used to increase the supply of fish. He also approached His Excellency the Political Resident who obtained the advice of the Government of Aden and of Dr. Bertram Thomas, who undertook an examina tion of the Muscat fisheries for the Sultan of Muscat. They all agreed that the only practicable way for the Bahrain Government to increase the supply of fish here is to purchase a depot ship fitted up with cold storage which could be sent to buy fish direct from the fishermen in the Gulf of Oman where, at present, the supply is greatly in excess of the demand. 12. SALE OF • • •-5- 12. SALS OF LANDED PROPERTY TO FOREIGNERS . His Highness became alarmed at what he considered the great Increase In the buying up of Bahrain property by foreigners and passed an ”Ahlan M forbidding further sales of land to foreigners. It would still be possible under the law for foreigners to rent land on a 99 years' lease. 13. MPOamiPN ^ UNDESIRABLES . In order to combat the rapid increase in prosti tution and the high incidence of venereal disease in Bahrain, the Bahrain Governraent .had many of the foreign prostitutes deported by the Political Agent at the begin ning of the year. 14. mmm- His Highness considered the introduction of his own metal coinage for small denomination coins from and including 8 annas downwards and asked the Political Agent for assistance in suggesting a place for minting them. Nothing was accomplished before the end of the year. One Mr. S. Ahmed of the State Bank of Pakistan visited the Gulf during August to enquire into the question of Pakistan currency in the Gulf. Pakistanis employed and paid locally were disturbed at the extra cost of remittances to Pakistan and at the pros pective loss of part of their savings and the depreciation of provident funds as a result of Pakistan's decision not to de-value their currency. Some of the commercial con cerns were prepared to pay compensation for the loss but the Bahrain Petroleum Company was not willing to accede to the employees' request and as a result of this many Pakistanis resigned. 15. CUSTOMS . Customs revenue from all sources amounted to Hs.63,31,586/-, an increase of Rs.12,57,243/- over last year. The increase was due to a steady increase in the volume of imports. The total number of Bahrain boats registered by the Customs Department was 274. 5 new motor launches were built during the year. 16. gQ 2D g O MPk . During the year the State spent Rs.66,00,000/- in buying foodstuffs. The major portion of .this amount was spent in buying sugar and rice which were obtained through His Majesty's Government. Prior to the arrival of this sugar from the Emergency Food Council, the State had to check the somewhat inflationary tendency in the free sugar market by issuing a small ration of 2 lbs. per adult per month for the people residing in the towns and £ lb. per adult in the villages from a reserve high priced . stock at a subsidised rate of Rs.1/9/- per Ruba* of 4 lbs. After the arrival of the quota however the ration was increased to 3 lbs. per adult in the towns, and the price was also reduced to Rs.l/S/- per Ruba* (4 lbs.). As in the • • • •As in the case of sugar, prior to the arrival of the Government quota stocks, prices of rice in the market rose far beyond the means of the poor and working class people. The State continued to receive from the British Ministry of Food, Basrah, regular monthly shipments of wheat. Towards the end of the year in addition to the rice ration, considerable quantities of wheat and wheat flour arrived from Australia consigned to local merchants. The flour market became overstocked and flour was sold locally in many instances at cost price. It soon became apparent that the public were not buying their wheat ration in full and the Government were forced to give up three months quota, having at the end of the year one year's stock in hand. 17 . Mizms. (i) lasQrts and Exports . A total of 411 freighters and 534 tankers called at Bahrain during 1949.. There were 275 British, 233 Panamanian and 168 American vessels. Imports of general cargo were 172,104 tons and exports of general cargo 110,040 tons. Exports of petroleum products were 6,143,258 tons and 80,000 drums, plus 1,892 tons of Asphalt. (11) Landing A rrangements . The Bahrain Government ordered a ten ton 'Smiths' shunting crane from the United Kingdom to make it possible to unload cargo from different points on the pier instead of from one point only. The crane did not however ar rive before the end of the year. (Ill) Slipway project . Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., proposed to build a slipway on the Muharraq side of the Shaikh Hamad bridge, but the Ruler proposed an alternative site on the Manamah side of the bridge and as this needed technical examination, nothing was carried out before the end of the year. is. mi MEm - Number of registered articles received Number of registered articles despatched Number of parcels received Number of parcels despatched Amount of Money Orders despatched Rs.

AMINISTMTION OF JUSTICE . (!) Agency Courts . 1629 Civil Suits, 279 Criminal Cases and 16 estate cases were dealt with by the Agency Courts during the year.' There wereThere were two session cases, one was a murder case and the other culpable homicide not amounting to murder. One German National from the Russian occupation zone entered Bahrain without a passport and was sentenced to imprisonment. He arrived as a seaman aboard a Swedish ship from which he deserted. There was one case of cheating and forgery in which a clerk in the British Bank of Iran and the Middle East was sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment. (ii) Local Courts .

There was one case of murder in which a Negro when he visited his divorced wife and was turned out, stabbed her with a knife. The result of the prosecution was not known before the end of the year. There was one case of attempted suicide in which the person who was found to be insane recovered. There were 321 cases of thefts compared to 33S during the previous year. There were 120 road accidents in which 9 persons were killed and 53 were injured. 21. (a) Trade and business. As the Customs receipts (vide paragraph 15) show, Bahrain, even improved upon its existing strong position as an entrepot port. This certainly is mainly due to the orderly and fair administration in the island which creates the conditions favourable to trade. The bazaar was very active and large quantities of goods were imported 'in transit'. Devaluation of sterling and the Indian Rupee caused a sudden increase in the number of Pakistan notes reaching Bahrain. All repatriation of Pakistan8 - notes was stopped by the Karachi authorities as from Octo ber 31st, 1949, and this business thereupon ceased. Money was not so plentiful in the bazaar as in the two previous years. It is believed that considerable funds went to Saudi Arabia in payment of dollars purchased there and for the establish ment of credits in non-sterling area countries in Saudi Arabian sterling. Large transfer of funds to Kuwait took place in the last quarter of the year for the purchase of gold and Pakistan notes. Retail business was as good as ever and it was estimated that employees of the Arabian American Oil Company from Dhahran were spending #10,000/- a week on pur chases in the Manam&amp;h bazaar. (b) Exchange and Currency . Exchange rates remained stable throughout the year for all sterling area currencies with the exception of Pakistan Rupees which were not devalued in line with other sterling area currencies. Devaluation of sterling in terms of the U.S. dollar had little or no effect otherwise. The 'free” dollar rate rose to Rs.5/15/- per dollar towards the end of the year but dropped to Rs.5/8/- at the close. 22. MEDICAL . (a) General . The general health of the communities has been good throughout the year. Smallpox broke out suddenly in December. The infected area was vaccinated by organised parties from house to house. Chloromycetin was used for the first time in Bahrain in October. It is claimed to be a cure for the Typhoid group of fevers. Six patients were treated and all of them were cured. Good progress had been made over partly controlled Venereal Disease. A*T.B. block was put up during the year by the Bahrain u overnment Medical Department. A Health Visitor was appointed in March. The duties of the Medical Officer are now chiefly those in connection with Quarantine work and in addition he looks after the Residency and Agency staffs and the employees of some local business firms. The Ministry of Works assumed responsibility on a short term basis for the repair and maintenance of the hospital building. Nothing much however was done as funds were very limited. (c) American Mission Hospital . There has been a noticeable increase in tuberculosis and particularly in the number of cases that have come to this hospital from al Hasa and Riadh. Since the establishment of V.D. Clinics by the Bahrain Government the number of cases of Venereal Diseases treated by the American Mission Hospital was few, but is noted that the patients have learnt to come to the hospital in the early stages of the disease rather than as formerly when it had progressed too far for any hope of cure. There had been a remarkable decrease in cases of Malaria in the last four years. (b) Victoria Memorial Hospital . Number of out-door patients treated Number of in-door patients treated Number of operations performed. 50,743 1,516 1,820 (d) State Hospital(d) State Hospital . Fractures and Injuries reached the high figure of 580 of which 147 were admitted to hospital. The Laboratory and X-Ray Department have expanded their work. Biochemistry, cultures, and Widals have furthered diagnosis considerably. ^lans for a larger laboratory are in hand and will be completed next year. A small sanatorium block of six beds was built and opened in May for Pulmonary Tuberculosis. 32 patients were admitted this year and isolation under such conditions it is hoped will give more promising results. Malaria has ceased to be a menace in the towns. A total of 1246 patients were treated during the.year. The new scheme of free compulsory treatment for Venereal Diseases has had an effect and large numbers of prostitutes received very intensive courses of treatment and the results have been very encouraging.

With the closing down of the Marine Airport, Muharraq air port has become very important as air traffic has increased considerably and at present the R.A.F. Medical Orderly is carrying out the quarantine work very efficiently but in due course it will be necessary for either the Customs or Passport Officer of the Bahrain Government to assume these duties. 23. BAHRiilN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED . Mr. R.M. Brown was the Chief Local Representative throughout the year. (b) Production . A total of 10,986,484 net barrels of crude oil was produced from the Bahrain field during 1949, or an average production rate of 30,097 net barrels per day. (c) Development . Two new wells were drilled on the Bahrain structure and completed in the main producing horizons during 1949. The work of correcting unsatisfactory conditions which are revealed from time to time, and preventive measures to guard against corrosion failures in existing wells, has been con tinued. A total of nine wells have been worked on and completed during the year and one well was under repair when the year ended. An extensive study has been made of the corrosion problem including an investigation into the practicability of applying cathodic protection to oilwell casings. (d) Imports • • • •was • • • 11 - I mortg of Arabian American Cmda. Receipts of Arabian Artierlcan Crude through the Arabian-Behrain submarine pipeline totalled 44,767,470 net barrels during the year and an additional 494.347 net barrels were received by tanker through Sitra marine terminal, making a total of 45.261 817 net barrels received in the Refinery. (e) Exploration ffork - During the year exploration work was actively con tinued and the drilling of a second deep test well was started. Exploration of the Additional Area has continued throughout 1949. The geophysical survey of the water covered areas by the reflection seismograph method which was started last year, has progressed favourably and was still under way at the end of the year. In addition to the geo physical work mentioned above, two structure holes were drilled in the waters to the north of Fasht al Jarim. (f) ILefinery Operations . Operation of the Refinery was at e high level through out the year and the total crude run amounted to 55,956,746 barrels. Product shipments were as follows: Aviation Gasoline Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Fuel Fuel Oil Synthetic Crude Asphalt 103,519 13,944,427 4,810,785 9,005,467 23,307 620 975,925 264.948 barrels ti M II It II ft 5£i41?:69;l The above quantity of aviation gasoline represented stocks which were imported from Abadan. The year’s crude running represents approximately a 2.4 per cent increase over 1948 operations and necessitated operation on a close shipping schedule. U) Refinery . Major new operating facilities completed and placed in commission during the year were one Vacuum Unit, one Turbo-Generator, one Boiler, two tanks, and one reformer cooling tower. A pumphouse and two pumps were installed at Budaiyah to supply water to the Refinery. Facilities were installed along the line at East and West Raffa to supply Raffa residents with drinking water. Housing was constructed near the pumphouse for the operators. A vermi- culite furnace was installed for local production of ex panded vermiculite and for insulation purposes. Eleven additional tanks were constructed in the Refinery and a number of major facilities, alterations and additions to existing facilities were completed during the year. (h) Sit rah. Three new tanks were constructed at Sitrah during the year and seven old wooden launches were replaced with four steel mooring launches and two steel passenger launches. Two new wooden barges were built, the launch berth at the causeway for survey craft was extended, the tank field fence-12- was replaced, four beacon lights were installed on steel pile structures in the harbour, and one pile driving equip ment was installed on a wooden barge. Marine Railway and additional navigational aids on the wharves were some of the many additional work at °itrah which were under construction at the end of the year. (i) Camp facilities . 37 married quarters and 13 bachelors*quarters were completed during the year. Due to late delivery of materials some of the buildings, according to the programme, were not completed. The Executive Guest House was completed during the year and also one of the thirteen 4-bedroom bachelor quar ters was installed in the hospital area and was occupied by nursing sisters. During the year work was commenced on the construction of a storage building, an additional squash court, a service bar and a terrace extension to the Bapco Club. A new automatic telephone exchange was under construction as the year ended and will be completed during the first half of 1960. 0) Employees.

EOYAl NAVY . (i) Captain L.E. Porter, R.N., was relieved by Captain P. Skelton, R.N., as Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, during the year, who had his headquarters f©a? some time in H.M.S. 'Wren' soon after he took over, and in H.M.S. 'Wild Goose' afterwards. He paid numerous visits to Bahrain and took His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain to Kuwait in November. (ii) Early in January, His Excellency the Commander- in-Chief, East Indies Station, Rear Admiral C.H. Woodhouse, C.B., accompanied by Mrs. and Miss Woodhouse, arrived in Bahrain in H.M.S. 'Norfolk'. The usual calls were ex changed and the Shaikh and relatives invited to a tea party on board. During His Excellency^ visit the U.S. ships 'Chikasia', 'Tarawa', 'D.U.J. BuckAey' and 'Hawkins' were in the harbour and calls were exchanged between their Commanders and Rear Admiral Woodhouse. The Shaikh gave a dinner party for His Excellency and invited the officers of all ships and prominent local residents. (iii) Wften Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Than! of Qatar abdicated in favour hf his son Shaikh Ali, H.M.S. 'Flamingo' (Lt. Commander D.J. Godden, R.N.,) visited Doha and provided a Guard of Honour and a bugler, the ship f s guns fired a salute before the Acting Political resident announced Shaikh Abdullah*s intention to the Shaikh*s assembled family of over 60 re latives and notables of Qatar in the courtyard just outside the palace compound. A small Naval landing party was set ashore from H.M.S. 'Flamingo' subsequently relieved by H.M.S. 'Wren', for nine days as a precautionary measure against any untoward incident. 27. United States Navy • • •UNITED STATES NAVY , (i) In January the U.S. ships 'Chikasia'. 'Tarawa”, 'D.U.J. Buckley”, and Hawkins visited Bahrain. (ii) Lt. Commander W.P. Collins, U.S.N., assumed duties as Commander Persian Gulf Liaison Officer in June relieving Lt. Commander E.B. House, U.S. Navy. (iii) Captain K.G. Hensel, U.S.N., succeeded Captain W.V. O'Regan, U.S.N., as Commander of Persian Gulf Area Command in August. (iv) The U.S.S. 'Greenwich Bay' visited the Trucial Coast in the beginning of August and arrived at Sharjah on the 4th. The Ruler of Sharjah called on Captain W.V. O’Regan, U.S.N., Commander Persian Gulf Area Command, and the Commanding Officer, Captain T.P. Thomas, U.S.H. (v) Major General Wallace, United States Marine Corps Director of Marine Aviation, passed through Bahrain by air on the 19th September on a circular tour from the southern back to the northern Mediterranean and stayed two days on the 'Greenwich Bay'. (vi) Captain K.G. Hensel, U.S,N., was styled Commander Middle East Force, instead of Commander Persian Gulf Area Command, in September, end his area now covers the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and extends to Ceylon. He has the local rank of Commodore. 28. U,S. CONSUL, DBAHRAN . Mr. Parker T, Hart took over from Mr. Francis E. Melloy as U.S. Consul at Dhahran during the year. In September he wrote to the Rulers of Bahrain and Qatar informing them that his post was raised to a Consulate-General from the 7th of that month. He visited Qatar in October and called on the Ruler accompanied by the Political Officer. He paid numerous visits to Bahrain. 29 . nsmes- (i) Sir John Crocker, Commander-in-Chief, Middle East Land Forces, accompanied by Lady Crocker and two officers of his staff visited Bahrain in September and stayed at the Residency. During his stay General Crocker visited the oil installations in Bahrain and Qatar. His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain gave a dinner party in his honour and presented him with a sword. (ii) Mr. Coste Florets, French Minister of Colonies, passed through Bahrain in August in a special aircraft on his way to Indo-China. He came ashore to lunch. He against passed through Bahrain on his way back from Indo-China by the end of August. (iii) There were many other visiters to Bahrain during the year most of them connected more or less remotely with oil. 30 : ims. QF mmm - (i) Bslirairi a ud Palestine . His Highness donated one lakh of rupees to the United Nations Relief Organisation for Palestine Refugees in February. In March... - II M(vii) • • • In March It was reported that some local Jews re ceived a letter from an 'Israelite* Society in France asking all Jews who wished to go to Israel to furnish the society with their ages and other passport particulars. Some of the Jews did actually leave Bahrain for Israel at the beginning of the year but repented later for having done so and were trying to come back If it could be arranged. The Bahrain Government is strongly opposed to taking them' back when once they had left Bahrain for Israel. In response to an appeal from the International Students Association asking for help for Arab Students in England rendered destitute as a result of the Arab-Israeli war, the Bahrain Government sent the Association a cheque for £ 50/- in May. In November there was some recrudescence of anti- Jewish feeling of which one evidence was malicious moves against a Jewish merchant. His younger brother was beaten severely in school and he himself had to endure rather stupid telephone calls from people threatening to kill him. (ii) Bahrain Races. Two Race Meetings were held during the year, one in April and the other in December, the proceeds of which were given to the Palestine Refugees Fund. (Hi) Karachi Economic Conference . The Pakistan Government sponsored a meeting in November df non-official representatives from various countries with which Pakistan has cultural and economic ties to study the economic rehabilitation and individual development of their respective countries and to bring about better trade relations between them. The Bahrain Government was invited to send non-official representatives, but the Ruler was not in favour of sending anyone. (iv) Syria . The assassination of Colonel Hasni Zaim, the Syrian President, and Mohsin Albarazi, the Prime Minister, moved Bahrainis to indignation against the assassins. The re port that they communicated with the British political authorities immediately after the murders caused comment unfavourable to His Majesty’s Government. (v) Air Services . One Mr. F. Bosworth, an ex-R.A.F. pilot, who was interested in running air services based on Bahrain and who in course of time proposes to start a limited company with capital from local merchants, was given permission to operate non-scheduled flights between Bahrain, Qatar, and Sharjah. (vl) Sunni-Shia feeling . Sunni-Shia. antipathy always dormant was awakened here by the displacement of the Sunni Head Clerk in the State Engineer’s Office by a Shia. Shias already hold most of the better paid posts in the Bahrein Government and the fact that they are better qualified to do so does nothing to lessen Sunni resentment.(vii) Bevl sion cf Oil Royalties . In December the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain wrote to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, through the Political Agent, saying that the oil royalty should be revised from the 1st January, 195G. The revised royalty he stated should be Rs.10/- per ton instead of Rs.3/8/- per ton as under the present agreement. 31. WEATIIUIR .

Political Agent, Bahrain.c V', Administration Report of the British Agency, Doha, from August to December, 1949, as reported by Mr. A.J. Wilton, Political Officer, Qatar. 1. The Ruling Family On 20th August, at a ceremony at the Palace in Doha, Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim al Than! formally abdicated in favour of his eldest son, All. The ceremony nas con- m ducted by the Acting Political Resident, and H.M.S Flamingo (Lt. Cmdr. D.J. Godden, R.N) provided a guard of honour and fired a salute. 2. On 1st September the nen Ruler took up residence in the Palace in Doha, tfhich thus became once more the seat of the Government of Qatar. Shaikh Abdullah continued to live in his Palace at Riyan, some ten miles from Doha. 3. At the time of his abdication, Shaikh Abdullah removed the entire contents of the Qatar treasury, includ- inr notably the seven lacs advance payment by tiie superior Oil Company which had begun the trouble which led to his abdication. His action was not considered in any way extra ordinary, and aroused no indignation in the country. He left his successor in a penniless state which contributed largely to the speed with which the wealthy Darwish family have been able to extend their influence over him. ^ce his abdication Shaikh Abdullah has successfully claimed from his son customs and other dues in respect of the months prior to his abdication, and has generally continued to con stitute a considerable drain on the limited wealtn or tne country to which he now contributes nothing. 4. The remainder of the Ruling Family, whose demands for a fare share of the oil income led Abdullah to contemplate abdication, were disappointed in their expectations when he bequeathed to his successor his obligations but not the means of fulfilling them, and they too have laid claim to a disproportionate share of what has been available, without in any way feeling that their Just claims have been met. visits of Officials. 5 The Acing Political Resident, Mr. H.G. Jakins, ‘ visited Doha several times between the 16th and 21st August in connection with the abdication. 6 Mr. J.A.F. Gethin remained in Doha between the abdication and the arrival of the Political Officer on 23rd August. 7. His Excellency the Political Resident visited Doha in H.M.S. ,, W r ren M (Commander G. Afflick-Graves, R.ft) on 6th September and exchanged calls with the new Ruler. On October His Excellency accompanied General Sir John Crocker, C-in-C, M.E.L.F., on a tour of the Oil Company’s installa tions in Qatar. 8 Mr. C.J. Pelly, O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, visited Doha on 2nd December and returned to Bahrain on 5th. The Political ••••The Political Situation . 9. At the time of the abdication, Shaikh Abdullah and his successor both agreed to the implementation of the unfulfilled articles of the 1916 Treaty with Great Britain, which provided for the appointment of a Political Officer in Qatar, the establishment of a postal and tele graph agency, and the admission of British traders. Shaikh Ali also made a written request for the appointment of an Adviser. 10. A Political Officer was appointed, and an Agency was opened in Doha on 23rd August. The Ruler has promised to give a piece of land for a permanent building, end suitable sites are being examined. 11. In the days immediately preceding the abdication, a certain community of interest developed between Salih al Mani' and the disgruntled members of the Ruling Family. Dissatisfaction at the growing miserliness of Shaikh Abdullah, and the growing control of the Darwish over him, which threat ened to exclude everyone else from participation either in the oil income or indeed in the conduct of affairs at all, led both fcalih and the Shaikhs relatives to exert pressure upon him. He yielded first to the importunities of his relatives, and then, before he could fulfil his promises to them, to Salih’s ultimatum, and abdicated. The relations were disappointed of the fruits of their agitation, and Salih was soon to be disappointed of his, for the Darwish, who had not quarrelled with the old Ruler, now lavished their wealth and attention on the new, and swiftly recovering from the blow which Salih had hoped would prove fatal to their influence, achieved a degree of control which seriously threatened Salih’s few remaining powers. The dissatisfied members of the family have continued to declaim and protest at the usurpation of power by the Darwish, but lack either the unity to force their removal or the ability to take their place. Shaikh Sa’ud, the Ruler’s cousin who lives in Wakra, seemed at one time the ablest and most disposed to take a strong independent line, and tried to exert pressure on the Ruler by interfering with the operations of the Company in his area. In this he was discouraged by the appearance of H.M.S. ''Flamingo” off Wakra, and he subsequently made his submission to the Shaikh and received 7,000 rupees. The Darwish are credited with having had the sum raised from 3,000 rupees, and Sa’ud appears to have decided that co-oneration with them is more profitable than trying to squeeze the Company. The Shaikh has proved reluctantly amenable to influence on most points on which representations have been made to him, and has agreed to the appointment of an Adviser, the establishment of a branch of the Eastern Bank at Doha, and the opening of an office by Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie. Preliminary talks have also been held with representatives of Messrs. Cable and Wireless about the opening of a tele graph office. He had not, up to the end of the year, been induced to bring the country’s financial or administrative affairs into any sort of order, and there is no accounting system* or attempt to plan expenditure. All reforms of this nature are postponed pending the arrival of tue Adviser. The Shaikh’s position in the country is not challenged by any individual or group, but nor is his control particularly effective, and the absence of opposition indicates a lack of governmental action rather than any real unity of purpose. Finances • • •Financ es, 12. Since taking over an empty coffer in August, the Shaikh has received an advance of 4 lacs from the Oil Company, on account of royalties. He has also had monthly payments from the Company for Customs Dues, wages of guards , etc., of between 30,000 and 40,000 rupees. The Doha Customs have yielded about 20,000 rupees a month, and there have been other miscellaneous incomings. All this has been spent, and a further advance from the Company was sought. When it was made clear that such an advance could only be made if a budget was prepared and the Political Officer supervised expenditure, the Shaikh dropped ths repiest and borrowed from the Darwish instead. He is thus spending at a rate of well over 20 lacs a year, and perhaps very much more. It is not likely that his first year’s royalties, after deductions for ad vances, will reach 30 lacs, so that his income during the next year, on which so many greedy eyes are fixed, will not permit as marked an increase in his rate of expenditure as is comiuonly anticipated. Security and Public Order . 13. No threat exists to the State of Qatar from outside her frontiers, and public order within them is reasonably good. There is a marked absence of violent crime. Stealing from the Oil Company, smuggling and slave trading are national industries in which the Ruling Family are as deeply involved as anyone, and with which the Gov ernment is unable or unwilling to interfere. 14. Soon after his accession, the Ruler agreed to employ a British Police Officer and to establish a proper nolice force. On 3rd September, Mr. R. Cochrane arrived in Doha on loan from the Bahrain State Police, and began this work. The Ruler’s enthusiasm for the scheme was only luke-warm however, and continual pressure had resulted by the end of the year, in a poorly clad, underpaid force of 30 men, not yet sufficiently trained to perform ordinary police duties. Nevertheless in December the Ruler agreed to buy 75 new rifles and ammunition for them, and also, in principle, to continue to employ Mr. Cochrane as a &gt; H 'atar Government official. Foreign J lelatlons- 15. The Government of Qatar took no part in the negotiations over its southern frontier which took Place in Jedda in October, and left the conduct of the matter entirely in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. 16. Hopes of a 'rapprochement” between Bahrain and Qatar over the Zubarah question rose at the time of the abdication of Shaikh Abdullah, when Shaikh All wrote in friendly terms to Shaikh Salman, and received an equally friendly reply, together with the loan oi 3e rifles. The change of rulers unfortunately betokened no change^in watar s intransigence, and the Shaikh of Bahrain* s disappointment at the absence of response to his gesture has led &gt;n his part to somewhat of a decrease in cordiality and co-opera tion. Oil......(vy -4- m- 17. The operations of Messrs. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. continued slightly ahead of sbhedule. Between 11th and 13th November, the sea lines were successfully pulled at Umm Sa'id, and the first export of oil was achieved on 30th December in the French tanker ’’President Meny”. 18. On 6th August, Shaikh Abdullah signed an agree ment with the representative of Centrrl Mining Investments Ltd. and the Superior Oil Company, giving them the concession for his rights in the sea-bed crf.l of Qatar. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd* consid.ered that their existing concession included these rights, and arbitration between the two parties has not yet taken place. 19. Relations between the new Ruler and Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. have not been good. This is partly due' to the former*s Insatiability, and ingenuity in thinking up new ways of getting money and goods from the Company 5 and to his inability to control pilfering. A con tributory cause has been the Company’s attempt to achieve the impossible feat of conducting its relations with the Shaikh through a representative in Bahrain, of whose work Qatar forms only a part. 20. The following is a roster of Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. employees in Qatar as on 31st December, 1949: I British 180 Americans 20 Swiss 1 French 1 Lebanese 1 Indians 399 Pakistanis 161 Goans 130 Bahrainis 203 Muscatis 69 Qataris 2231 Palestinians 4® Lebanese 17 Iraqis 13 TransJordanians 60 Omanis 3 Kuwaitis . 1 Sharjahis 13 Somalis 6 Total 3548 Shipping* 21. 16 vessels, totalling over 60,000 tons, called at Umm Sa’id during the year, with over 11,000 tons of oil pipe-line, tank-plate, mooring gear and general cargo for the Oil Company. Apart.from goods for the Company there were no direct shipments of goods to Qatar ports except for a small coastal steamer calling at Doha with petrol about every two months, - the A.l.O.C. local delivery service from Abadan. :==:=:sADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BRITISH AGENCY, SHARJAH, for the year 1949 (as reported by Mr. P.D.

His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., visited the Trucial Coast for his annual tour from 6th to 12th February, accompanied by Lady Hay and Miss nay and by Mr. G.N. Jackson, (representing Political Agent, Bahrain). During his tour, His Excellency exchanged calls . with all Trucial Coast Buiers and flew over Buraimi, Jebel Hafit and the Wadi Jizzi. An extremely heavy north westerly gale made landing from the L.T. Nearchus virtually impossible for part of the tour and His Excellency was accommodated ashore for part of the period. On 26th March, His Excellency spent tne night in Sharjah en route for Masirah. His Excellency again visited the Trucial Coast on the 8th May accompanied by Mr. Bernard Burrows, Head of Eastern Department of the Foreign Office. Owing to the better weather conditions obtaining in early winter, His Excellency decided to advance his 1960 tour to the month of December 1949. He visited the Trucial Coast in L.T. Nearchus, accompanied by Lady Hay and Miss Hay, from 6th to 10th December. Calls were exchanged with Trucial Coast Rulers and a visit paid to the unloading and drilling • • • •2 and drilling sites of Messrs.

On the 20th July Mr. Muhammad Jaffer, sub-postmaster, Dubai, left for Pakistan, on leave. On the 17th August, Mr. H.C. Breach, Superintendent, British Post Office, Persian Gulf, arrived at Sharjah from Bahrain by air. He inspected Dubai Post Office and returned to Bahrain by steamer on the 19th. 8. SHIPPING . During the period under report 43 ships called at Sharjah and 80 ships at Dubai. 9. AIJTI-LOCUST WORK . On 26th January a Pakistan anti-locust team under Mr. H.M. Abbas arrived in Trucial Coast. After carrying out a brief survey in the coastal areas, the team operated control measures in March against locusts which were^ breeding in the Marmoum area 35 miles South East of Dubai. Mr. R. Waterston, F.R.S.E., arrived in Trucial Coast on 21st April to study the situation and 3rd. May Mr. G. Popov of Desert Locust Survey arrived to take charge of operations. The work was hindered throughout by lack of adequate transport and funds and by the opposition of the Huler of Dubai to the use of poison bait in his territory. The Pakistani team finally left for Karachi in June. As a result of the experience gained in the spring, it was decided to despatch to Trucial Oman in the autumn a control Unit and a survey team of Desert Locust Survey both administered by Fast Africa High Commission. • On 9th November, Mr. G. Popov arrived in Sharjah to organise the winter’s campaign. He will be assisted by four British Officers and is adequately provided with vehicles and equipment for extensive survey and control measures. The intention of the Survey UnitR is to penetrate the interior of Oman as far as possible and to obtain detailed topographical in formation and to study locust breeding, whilst the control unit is to deal with swarms in the coastal areas. Mr. K. Stephenson, F.R.E.S., Director of Desert Locust Survey, Nairobi, arrived in Trucial Coast on 6th December to study local conditions and left on 15th. 10. pFTROLFUM PFVEL0PMLN^ ( 1 RUCIAL COAST) LIMITED . Throughout 1949, the Company continued its detailed exploratory operations in the area of the Jebel All and of the sands immediately fringing the Abu Dhabi Sabkha. A rapid seismic survey was also made on the Coastal Strip between Dubai and Umm al Quwain. In early August, an unloading camp was established on the shores of Khor Ghanadah, a creek in Abu Dhabi ter ritory, capable of harbouring not merely launches, but also the Company’s landing ship, S.S. Jassura. At this camp vehicles, stores and equipment were landed and a drilling camp was established at Ras Bear, some 10 miles south west of Ghanadhe. By the end of the year, the foundations of the drilling rig had been laid and drilling is expected to begin before the spring of 1950. Considerable difficulty was ...-4- was experienced by the Company in setting up these camps firstly on account of the inhospitable terrain ana the extreme heat and secondly, through trouble with the labourers recruited in Abu Dhabi. There were numerous strikes in the early stages, due, it is believed, partly to deliberate trouble-making by the Ruling Family of Abu Dhabi, who a tempted by this means to persuade Petroleum Development (T’Ticial Coast) Ltd. to renounce their claim uo the Abu Dhabi sea-bed oil rights. by the end of the year, however, the rig had reached a height of SO feet and operations were proceeding smoothly under the direction of Mr. K.M. Maude. The operations at Sadr employ about Is Europeans an locals. The Company's Representative in Trucial Coast was Mr. H.M. Jackson until 17th June when he was relieved by Mr. E.F. Henderson.‘ ^mmlovees: Brl tish • • 24 American • • 1 Swiss • • 1 Indians • • 10 Pakistanis • • N 13 Trucial Coast subjects 298 Bahrainis • • 4 Portuguese Indians 14 Muscatis • • 4 Tra ns j ord anians • • 14 Iraqis • • o Irani • • 1 11. CENTRAL MIKINfi Ai\ T 2 IKVKST^.-T COR PORAPOM L2£. AND STTPH-ilOK OIL C0MPAK1 Ll£. On 6th March the late Sir Hugh Weightman, C.S.I., C.I.E., representing Central Mining and Investment Corporation, arrived on the Trucial Coast to ex P io 3; e . J ne a p0£ ' s ^ 1 n?? obtaining on behalf of his Comparer and the Superior Oil . Comoanv from the Iruci&amp;l Coast Shaikhs for the aiea sea-bed which might accrue to them. On 9th accompanied bv Mr Woods of Superior Oil. he visixed the Rulei of Abu Dhabi and from that time until August held frequent discus sions with the Rulers of Abu Dhabi ana Oubai. ho conces- -iorg w e re signed, largely, it is believed, because the Shaikhs, whose appetites had been whetted by the pay ments promised to Kuwait by American Indppenoent Oil company in 1941, made quite impossible demands lor ri ydities. Following Sir Hugh's death in October, Lt. Col. A.C. Galloway, C I E 0 B.E. visited the Trucial Coast on 6th December to m-ipen negotiations on behalf of Superior Oil Company wno are now believed to wish to obtain the concessions for themselves' alone. On ,16th December, Ur. Smith of Superior Oil Company visited Abu Dhabi in this connexion. Superior Oil Company appear to have no competitors for the Trucial Coast sea-bed. 12. GOLDEN VAII- Y Q.-fl.r- ADD OXIDE COMPAM. Iron Oxide continued to be mined on Abu Musa and Sir Bu Nai’r islands during the year and 2500 tons were exported to the United Kingdom from Abu Musa and 2200 tons • • •en 1 5- 2200 tons from Sir Bu Nai ! r. Strikes occurred amongst the labourers during April, but were not of such a nature as seriously to interfere with the Company^ programme, and firm action was taken by the Shaikh of Sharjah against the ringleaders. Mr. E. Innes Pocock was in charge of the mines until 17th May when he left for the United Kingdom whence he returned on 12th November. On 3rd December Mr, Pocock, accompanied by his Sharjah Agent, Khan Sahib Hussain Ahmad, proceeded to Abu Dhabi to try to obtain from the Shaikh a concession for mining iron oxide within his territories. The Shaikh demanded a guaranteed royalty of 100,000 rupees per annum, a sum which the Company could not hope to pay, and as yet, no concession has been signed. 13. MKSSfc;. hOLLoWAYS BKUI KKKo (LONDON) LTD. In November, the Ruler of Dubai granted Messrs. Holloway Brothers permission to operate as constructional engineers in Dubai, and a store has already been erected in Dera by the Company's resident representative, Mr. J. Lindsay. On 13th November, Mr. Peter Holloway, a Director,visited the Trucial Coast and called upon the Ruler of £ubai. 14. INTERNATIONAL AERADIO LI Ml TED . Flying control at Sharjah airfield has now been taken over from the R.A.F. by International Aeradio Ltd. During the year, Sharjah airfield handled 815 aircraft, an increase of 517 over the previous year. A considerable increase of traffic resulted from the refusal by the Governments of India and Pakistan to allow Dutch machines to use their airfields during the Indonesian war, thus obliging aircraft bound for Indonesia to refuel at Sharjah or Bahrain. Night landing facilities were improved during 1949. A strike lasting two days took place among the Indian and Pakistani employees of International Aeradio Ltd. After two days, following an assurance by the Company that their grievances would be rectified, work was resumed. Mr. E. J. Palmer was Station Superintendent until 10th November when he was relieved by Mr. R. Helm. 15. Mr. W. THESIGER % P,^0 . Mr. Wilfred Thesiger, the traveller, arrived in Dubai in April from the interior of Oman. During the spring he had succeeded in penetrating as far as Nezwa and at one time even enjoyed the Imam's protection. After spending the summer in United Kingdom, he arrived back in the Trucial Coast on 23rd November, leaving for Buraimi after a few days in Dubai. 16. MINERAL RIGHTS IN SKA-BED of t he 1 RUCIAL COAST . In 1949, all Trucial Coast Rulers having a sea-coast on the Persian Gulf, issued public proclamations declaring the sea-bed lying off their shores to come within their jurisdiction and control. Whilst navigation, fishing and pearling rights in those waters are unaffected by such pro- ’ clamations, the Rulers claimed rights over minerals which may be found in that area of the sea-bed and subsoil. Dates ofi of -6- Dates of proclamations were: (a) Abu Dhabi 10th June (b) Dubai 13th June (c) Sharjah 16th June (d) Has al Khaimah (e) Umm al Qeiwain ) &amp; Ajman ) 20th June. 17. SLAVE TRADE . Action was taken against the Shaikhs in two parti cularly glaring cases of enslavement in 1949. On 24th December, 1943, Shaikh Rahma bin Abdurrahman, Shaikh of Hera, a dependency of Sharjah, was reported to have seized and sold to the bedouin three of his subjects, all free persons. Shaikh Rahma refused to come to the Agency to give an account of himself, and when a wsx sworn statement had been taken from one of his subjects exposing the Shaikh’s complicity in the affair, the Ruler of Sharjah was called upon to intervene with force. On 21st January Sharjah guards occupied Hera,remained in occupation throughout the year. Shaikh Rahma spent the year as the unwelcome guest of various Trucial Coast Rulers. Following reliable reports in March of kidnapped persons having been taken to Saudi Arabia as slaves in the launch 'Joker' belonging to Shaikh Rashid of Dubai, this vessel was detained in Bahrain at the request of the Political Agent and its crew arrested. The Ruler of Dubai disclaimed all knowledge of the case, but there is excellent reason to believe that his daughter Mozah and the sons of his brother Juma'h had carried out the whole business with his connivance. i/ifhether the action taken in these two cases and the enquiries made in numerous others have had an effect upon the Trucial Coast Rulers, it is difficult.to judge, but the number of enslavements reported to the Agency during the year steadily declined and during the second half of the. year, only 2 fresh cases were reported ky Ah* i arfemg»»»**&lt;« and both victims were restored by the intervention of the Rulers. 18. DUBAI - iiBU DhABI BOUNDARY . The two rulers having agreed to submit to H.M.G's arbitration over the Dubai - Abu Dhabi boundary, in 1949 the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, examined the rival claims and recorded the chief landmarks within the disputed area upon a nap. A comprehensive report was submitted to the Political Agent, Bahrain, on the 2nd April, and on 30th Kay, the Political Agent announced to both rulers his decision which was a line running inland from Ras Hasian, a headland roughly midway between the two towns, by the wells of Ghafur and Hafir to the well of Al Eshush. 19. ECONOMIC . During 1949, prices in general dropped and control of piecegoods and wheat was abolished as the free market products began to undersell the controlled product. As from September, Egyptian rice purchased through the Ministry of Food began to arrive and to be distributed through the Dubai and Sharjah Food Companies. This rice was/betterwas of better quality and cheaper than the rice hitherto available in the free market. Sugar, allocated under the United Kingdom control scheme, arrived in large quantities. 20. IHB YSAB'S EVENTS WITHIN THE SHAIKHDOMS . . (a) Shii\1aK Negotiations for the new Sharjah Air Agreement were opened in February and agreement was reached on many points but further progress was prevented by the grave illness of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr who was flown to Bahrain and subse quently Bombay on 10th March for hospital treatment. The Shaikh 1 s health is reported to have improved of late, but he is still in Bombay and his brother Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr is acting for him. The travel ban imposed on Sharjah in 1948 was lifted on 8th February, 1949. On 27th March Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr paid a further Rs.15,000/- to Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin as the Beni Qitab’s share of the payments received by Sharjah from the Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. He also paid protection momjy to the notorious robber Tuwairish, but still failed to guarantee the security of his vehicles using Jebel Fayeh road. The Ruler of Sharjah has asked Messrs. Holloway Brothers to survey Leia point and to submit an estimate for the construction of an artificial harbour for dhows there. He hop€s thereby to increase the prosperity of Sharjah whose creek has been steadily silting over the past few years. (b) £ubai. Dubai vehicles using the track to the Batinah via the Fayeh Pass, were frequently attacked early in the year by robbers, including Tuwairish. When later the Ruler provided escorts for cars, security over the route improved. In December, the Ruler of Dubai, after some hesi tation agreed to give a site on the south bank of the creek for the construction of an Agency, office and residence in Dubai to replace the existing building in Sharjah which is inadequate for the purpose. He had previously given a site for a hospital in Dera on the opposite shore. The Ruler’s eyesight continues to deteriorate and in December he brought an eye specialist from Bombay to advise as to treatment. It is feared, however, that nothing can be done to improve it. (c) Abu Dhabi . In April, exploratory parties of the Arabian American Oil Company, entered Abu Dhabi territory without the Ruler’s permission and reached a point about 25 miles north-east of Abu Dhabi town. Camps were also established in the region of Ras Sila at the western extremity of Abu Dhabi territory. On 22nd April, the Political Officer, accompanied • • •accompanied by Shaikh Hazza of Abu Dhabi, visited Sila and there found the Americans encamped under the protection of a Saudi Amir Haiyif and some armed Saudi guards. On 23rd April, an unfortunate incident took place in which the Saudis disarmed two Agency guards and detained the Political Officer for some hours. When the Agency rifles were eventually restored, the Political Officer and Shaikh Hazza returned to Abu Dhabi and thence to Bahrain and reported what had occurred to the Political Agent. This matter, together with the general question of the Saudi - Abu Dhabi boundary was taken up with the Saudis at governmental level. All Saudis and Aramco per sonnel had been withdrawn from the area by the end of April. The Ruler of Abu Dhabi, anxious to grant a sea-bed concession to.Superior Oil Company, has informed the Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, that he considers their existing concession covers the land only, a condition with which the British Company cannot agree. Although he has been called to arbitration under the terms of his concession, he has so far failed to nominate an arbitrator. Partly on account of the bad relations between himself and the Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd., and partly through suspicion of Dubai, Shaikh Shakhbut tried in October to prevent the entry of Dubai dhows, chartered by the Company, into Khor Ghanadha. The Political Officer having informed him that the Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. were entitled under the terms of their concession to employ such craft, he withdrew his objection, but later tried to impose a tax upon them. In June, the Ruler received a loan of four lakhs of rupees from P.C.L. much of this sum is believed to have been spent on consolidating his position in Buraimi. (d) Ras al Khalmah. The weakness and poverty of the ruling family and possibly the intrigue at long range by Sultan bin Salim have been at the root of a number of distimbances in Ras al Khaimah in 1949. In April Sal 1 6. al Badi of the Bidah tribe, assisted by the Shaikh of Rams rose against Ras al Khaimah. Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad, against the advice of his father and brothers arrested him and put out one of his eyes with a hot iron, a futile action which only served further to aggravate the situation and as a result of which tie Shihuh tribe also rose against him. Eventually, the Ruler of Dubai, who owns valuable properties in Ras al Khaimah, ar ranged a settlement between all parties. A further but minor dispute arose in October between Ras al Khaimah and the Shaikh of Jazirat az-2a*ab and again, with Bakha. In November, a section of the Khawatir tribe under Ali bin Obaid kidnapped two Ras al Khaimah women as a means of trying to extort money from the Ruler. The lion’s share of the annual payment made by the Shaikh to the Khawatir appears to have been made to the other section under Saif bin Ali. A settlement was eventually made through the mediation of the Ruler of Umm al Qaiwain. % . (e) Ajman • • •The Ruler made several journeys into interior Oman with the intention of extending his influence over the Kai'm tribe. His avowed intention, so far unfulfilled, of murdering his cousin Saqr bin Sultan, Chief of the Na'im, has now become the local joke. Uml al Qaiwain . During 1949 Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid gave valuable service on numerous occasions as mediator in local disputes. (g) Kalba . Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah continued to be in charge in Kalba in the absence of Shaikh Khalid the Regent. 21. E miSiLM?^_PX IRAfl AND THE MIDDLg EAST, RUBAI . Mr. M.P. Stott was manager throughout the year and Mr. L.J. MaCleay arrived on 30th November to take over duties of accountant. The bank*s business increased considerrbly in 1949 and sales of Sterling for the purchase of British goods increased to 7 times the 1948 volume. Payments to Indian accounts remained at the former level of about Rs.200,000 per week. Cash was plentiful throughout the year, and the bank seldom encountered difficulty in obtaining payment of bills. The bank acted as agent for the British Ministry of Food for the procurement of the rice quota. A change in the bank* s former title Imperial Bank of Iran caused confusion with the Iranian National Bank and did not indicate the present layout of the bank*s branches many of which notf lie outside Persia.INDIA OFF RECORD^ MICROFILM INDIA OFFICE LIBRARY and RECORDS Photocopying record '*'• S tZ/fSfz/ga?
