Study leave rules applicable to Military •Resistant Surgeons in Civil employ. Sir, In the late Education and Health department’s circular letter do.990, dated the 10th September 1921, it was stated that Military Assistant Surgeons in civil employ should be granted study leave under the rules published with the Finance department Resolution do.l306-C.S.R. f dated 23rd July 1920, except in provinces where it was not the practice to grant study leave to civil assistant surgeons under the rules in App .32 to the Civil Service Regulations. A« regards the latter it was suggested that these officers should continue to be governed by the rules in force fofc Military Assistant Surgeons in Military employ until they were replaced by the other rules. All the local Governments accepted these suggestions. 2. The study leave rules issued by the Finance depart- •&lt; ment in 1920 have, however, been revised since, the last modification being contained in the Finance department resolu tion No.F.20 (2)-C.S.R-25, dated the 4th February 1925. These were prescribed revised Study Leave Rules/by the Secretary of State in Council with reference to Fundamental Rule 84 which does not apply to officers of the Indian Medical department in civil employ who remain subject to military Leave Rules and to whom Fundamental Rule 100 is applicable. In the circumstances the position in regard to military assistant surgeons in civil employ is that L.P. the- 2 - ( ) To •Punjab - only (( )) To Punjab ) ■X, © the general Study Leave Rules for officers in civil employ, other than Indian Medical Service officers, are not applicable to their case and their study leave should therefore be goverxyded by the rules promulgated in -A-riny Instruction, India, Ifo.200 of 1923. In this connection attention is also invited to the last sentence of rule 12 of the revised -^tudy Leave Rules* published v/ith finance departments Resofaltion, dated the 4th February 1925, and to the 5'inance department Circular letter Ho.P-20U)-C.3.R.-25, dated the 23rd March 1925. ( The orders issued with this department’s letter Ko.315-H., dated the 4th March 1925 are hereby cancelled). ((3.

Fordham has recently been granted study leave under the Buies applicable to Civil Assistant burgeons, may be modified accordingly. The Local Government will no doubt consider whether any recovery of leave salary paid to the officer in excess of what is admiss ible under the rules would be justified under the circumstances in which it was drawn.))

The general rules for study leave which are at present applicable to officers in civil employ, except 2.H.3. Officers, are those published in the Finance department resolution Ho. 1306-C.S.R., dated the 23rd July 1920, for the grant of study '\' 4 &lt; leave to officers of the Scientific and Technical departments. The Government of India are not awmre to what extent civil assistant surgeons have been granted leave under these rules, but as it is desirable to treat as far as possible on equal terms in regard to study leave officers doing the smae kind of work, they are of opinion that military assistant surgeon* in civil employ may be granted study leave under these rulesin those provinces where it is the practice to grant study leave to civil assistant surgeons under the miss in Appendix 32 to the Civil Service Regulations. Ag regards military assistant surgeons in civil employ in provinces where such is not the practice the Government of Xndia think that they should continue to he governed by the rules in force for military assistant surgeons in military employ until they are replaced by the other rules. The Government of India would be glad to be inforiied in due course of the action taken by the local Government on their recommendation 3 , I am told to add that the rules for the grant of study leave to military assistant surgeons of the I.M.D. are now under revision.
