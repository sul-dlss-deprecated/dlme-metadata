Traces of gold on the face indicate that the deceased has been represented as a divine being with gold skin.<br />The entire coffin lid is covered with solar, funerary, and protective imagery. The gods Horus, Anubis, Osiris, Thoth, Isis, Nephthys, and Hathor in the form of a cow, among others, appear.  In the area of the legs, there is a vertical column of text containing a request for offerings. The deceased’s name and title also appear in this location. <br />Some of the scenes are vignettes illustrating chapters of the Book of the Dead, a funerary text that often was included with grave goods.  The main scene, on the chest, shows the deceased in a white linen garment being presented to Osiris, king of the underworld, by Horus and Thoth.  Behind Osiris stand his sisters, Isis and Nephthys, and an underworld deity. Several protective amulets are represented in the lowermost register.<br />When acquired by the Museum in 1924, the case was intact and closed. It was opened in 1933 to remove the mummy (E14344A).

This building was ornately decorated with inlaid faience, now missing, composing the figures of Akhenaten and Meretaten, as well as most other parts of the decoration. The sunshade chapel was a relatively small, probably single-chamber, building that would have originally stood on a raised podium inside of a larger building.The inscriptions state this building to have been located "" in Akhetaten"" - the capital city of Tell el-Amarna. This piece was part of what was once a larger block that included the door frame and lintel of the left side of the chapel pylon. It was cut down during the reign of Merenptah (Dynasty 19 ) when the block was  reused as a plinth for a sphinx. Inscriptions on the edges of the block have the titulary of Merenptah and the epithet:""beloved of Ra-Horakhty in Heliopolis"". The reused  block must have stood in a temple at Heliopolis.

It was excavated in the area of the  sacred enclosure of the temple of the god Ptah at Memphis, Egypt. The sphinx, a lion with a human head, represents the power of the Egyptian king, both to protect his people and to conquer the enemies of Egypt. This statue was buried up to its shoulders; only the exposed head was attacked by windblown sand, which eroded the facial features and the royal false beard. The inscriptions on the chest and around the base give the five names of Ramses II. His son and successor, Merenptah, added his own cartouches to the shoulders after his father's death. This sphinx, the the largest in the Western hemisphere, was quarried at Aswan and transported by river to the Ptah Temple at Memphis, 600 miles away. While it has never been placed on a scale, it is estimated to weigh just under 13 tons.",118724,Sphinx,"""https://upmaa-pennmuseum.netdna-ssl.com/collections/assets/1600/193353.jpg""",,Granite,,362.0,,,cm,145.0,,Statue,E12326,,New Kingdom|Nineteenth Dynasty,Egypt|Memphis (Egypt),,http://www.penn.museum/collections/object/118724
