BAHRAIiS. • OfMBHAX. for centuries the Persian Qulf hes been famous for its pearls anfl at present the eentre of the industry and the chief market of the Gulf is Bahrain, During recent years important Continental, Indian -nd Arab merchants, who used to send their Agents, hare come themselves to Bahrain. The prosperity and almost the very existence of Bahrain depends upon the Pearl industry. Boat building and srII making, the only local trades of any importance, are closely connected vith the pearl industry. she state revenue receives only a very small sum, directly, irom the pearl industry, this being pearling boat taxes, but indirectly it depends upon the result of the pearling season. The imports especially those of luxuries, increase and decrease in proportion to the quality of the season* HUMBERS SMM.OYBD. Over 500 pearling craft are registered in Bahrain and about 15,000 men»e Pearl Industry Bahrain, contd -2- men from Bahrain work each year sa divers, apart from large nuabars of foreigners, from Oman, Persia end the Arab coast. One of the disadvantages of the system is that it only provides employment during about half the year. During the off season the divers are idle and neither work nor oan be made to work at any other ocoupstion. 3. i-IViae SBASOB. The season is divided into three divisions. it lasts, roughly, from the middle Ot May until the middle of October. if the weather is calm and the see not too eie cold the two short seasons are longer. The divisions are as follows.- i ihanchieh - about 2o - 85 days. ii ahoos - the main season, 4 months and lo days. iii Radda - about 20-25 days. S^ery year the shaikh issues a proclamation announcing the dates of the beginning and the end of the SHOOS, ordering all divers to report to their fiakhudas ten days before the opening dayfhe Pearl industry Bahrain, Contd. -2- day In order to prepare the boats for sea. Ko orders are issued as to KHakghtrh and RUDDA and Hakliudaa may go out when they wish, The duration of the short seasons depends on the temperature of the water. 4. BIVIM6 MMHOBS. She actual diving methods are simple. Ho meohanioal apparatus is used. Some years ago a Persian attempted diving in a diver's suit, there was a general outcry against this and it was forbidden by Shaikh isa. A j.ew days ago an application was received from the same man asking permission to use a diving suit. it was refused. fhe pearl banks are free to every body, T*hen the Bakhuda has reached a likely position he anchors his boat and fixes the oars ao that they extend above the water horiaontally. A couple of are tied onto each oar f one with a weight upon it, on which the diver goes down f the other one by which he ia pulled up, if diving in deep water# m shallow water the diver rises to the surface without assistance.I ' 6 Peerl Industry Bahrain, Conta. She average depth is about &lt;2&lt;D feet. when the diver oomes up to the surface he hands his shells to the puller and they are heaped on the deck. 3?he divers work in relays diving almost continuously for about an hour at a time. Each dive averages about a minute and a half, livery diver provides himself with a clip, like a clothes peg, which he fastens onto his nose, also hard leather finger guards which enable him to dislodge the shells from the rocks without damaging his hands. Hound his neck he a string bag in which he puts his shells. she divers wear nothing but a loin cloth. !rhe shells are opened ever^ morning before the diving begins, and thrown back into the sea. she divers have a theory that by throwing the shells into the sea they provide food for the next years oysters. fhey also believe that pearls have something to do withpearl Industrj', Bahrain, Contd, —5— with drops of rain falling into the sea. ihe flakhuda watohea over the opening of the shells, collects any pearla and shuts them up in the sea chest, it is difficult to steal pearls because they wear practically no clothes and they hatre nowhere to hide them. 5. MSDICAL. Diving is an unhealthy profession end Tte* aiiii=£S» divers aa a whole are not long lived. The boats are very over-crowded and sometimes they remain out at sea for two months at a time. rhe uivers live on a ration of datea, rice and fish. Most divers suffer from ear trouble. Rupture of the ear-drum is almost universal, in fact men are not considered proficient until this has occurred, i^uphyeema of th© lungs is common and is often followed by Bronchitis, acute and chronic. Very often diving causes delation of the heart with valvular desoase. Scurvy is often noticed during and after the season but Hakhudas appear to know the preventive value of lime juice and no boat leaves for the banksPearl Industry Bahrain, Contd. -6- banka without a quantity of dried fresh limes. Quite a number of oasss of fish bites occur, especially by a large fish, not a shark, which inflicts a straight out like that of a sword. During the season the Government's hospital boat, a large well-equipped boom, which was purchased four jears ago, remains out at the banks and the Indian sub Assistant surgeon deals with cases of illness among the divers. Moat of the Bahrain Kakhudas seem to be particularly callous about the health of their divers. They do cot understand thKt to temperarilj rele%8e a sick diver will be more profitable in the long run. There are quite a number of blind men among the divera. Blindness does not incapacitate them from diving, 6 » i-IVIHS SYSTEMS. Pivers do not receive wages. They are supposed to share in the profits of the boats catch. They also receive advances, loans, from their Bakhudas. Various systems are practised in Bahrain of which the most important are the following # (i) SBMfXEH, or loan system, is the most uni-Bearl industry Bahrein, Contd. -7- most universal. in this there are two methods, Madyan and Anil . Undyan . fhe Bakhuda of the boat is financed by the Isnd merchant who lends money, at interest, for paying advances to the divers, equipping the boat and purchasing provisions for the season. The rate of Interest has now been laid down; 20$ for the period of the off season and 10$ during the SH00S» The same rate of interest which is charged by the merchant to the Eakhuds is oherged by the flakhuda to the divers and added to their debit account whan they receive their advances. The Uakhuda is not bound to sell his pearls to the merchant who financed him. Amil. The Hakhuda borrows from a land merchant but instead of charging interest the merchant has a right to purchase the pearls st not more than 20$ less than the market value. Throughout the whole system it is the land merchants, the oopitaliats, who make the biggest profits. in reality they are partly money lenders but as money lending is forbidden by the QURM some of them advance bags of rice instead of rupees.I o Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd. -8- Shay ere praetlcally certain of s Tery good interest on the money which thoy lend and they also compete in the buying and selling of pearls in the market. Ihe biggest men in the pearl industry in Bahrain are the merchants who finance the boats. shey buy pearls, cheaply, from their own Hakhudas and then sell at good profits. Only a very few of them started life as Hakhudas; most began as land merchants in a small way, or brokers, gradually acquiring funds with which to .'.inance first one boat, and then another and in some cases as many as twenty or thirty boats. But as these merchants do more of the big buying and selling and speculate more on the fluctuations of the market they stand more risk of disaster than the Hakhudas. Every merchant tries to sell his pearls locally during the season but most years one or two big men stick out too long for higher prices and have to follow the foreign buyers down to Bombay hoping to sell in India.

If the conditions of the diving system were properly carried out, under normal circmstfmces. this last advance should be unnecessary. At the end of the season the divers should receive their earnings and these are generally sufficient to « carry them on till the nest season. it is dif ficult to estimate an average, but I think that during the last three years a diver's average earnings has been about Fs. 250/- to Hs. 300/-. Actually only a very few divers receive any earnings at all. During three years, dealing with hundreds of cases between divers, Hakhudas and merchants, i tove not met half a doien divers on tho13 erl Industry Bahrain, Contd# -li on the &gt;&gt;elaiieh system, who received any earnings# Almost evory Bahrain diver is ia debt to his fiekhuda, but thro© years ago the debts were even heavier than they are now. Tho better the diver, the greater the debt, not because he does not earn more, but because being a good worker, ho has been lent more money in the past in order to put him into debt and bind him permanently to his KaMiude, ainoe the Diving Reforms the (Jovernment has laia down the amount of advances which Bakhudaa may make, but recently the Mfkhudas have evolved a method of circumventing those orders. 2hey lend money to divers whom the., wish to retain, and do not enter it into their books. She diver signs a separate receipt and most of the divers believe that these side loans bind them to dive for their flakhudas. if a Makhuda claimed the right to keep a diver with him on account of a side loan the Court would dis-regard the claim, but the divers do not realise this at present. Sne following are the amounts of the advances since the reforms. Previously goodlariing Industry Bahrain, ContcU -13- Diver® did not even receive the full amounts which were debited against them as 3mch of it consiated of heavy interest, Goods such as rice, tobacco etc. were ^Iso charged against the divers at exhorbitant prices# Very often they did not receive them. ^ T o proper accounts i?ere kept so the men could never check the amounts which they were said to owo # Often when a diver died his sons were compelled to dive for the father's j^althuda. T&amp;ey also were lent money and soon became bound to the JKalrhuda, and so the system flourished. The greatest difficulty in attempting to improve conditions are the divsrs themselves. They are vey improvident and absolutely illiterate# Most of them do know how much they owe. As long as they receive advances and are young, they do not bother about the debts, but when they begin to feel incapable of diving they find them selves forced to dive because they owe money. Education will be the greatest protection for the divers against being swindled, but bh* at the(C? earl Industry Bahrain, Contd. -14- at the present rat© of progress It will be many y^ars before even even &amp; saiall percentage of the divers can read and ^rite. The beneficial results of the reforms will not be thoroughly evident for several years to come. The Be forma effected several improve ments, regular accounts, a fixed rate of interest, definite adTsnces, and the abolition of the old selsfieh Court, a notoriously corrupt diving Court. When the Reforms were first instituted, they were enforced with considerable vigour, but lately in my opinion, they ere being tlloned to ai' cJron. Althoi^h H. E. Sheikh Hanr d is mildly Bjmpathct.tc towards the divers, he dislikes countemneing any aotion which may possibly annoy any of the merohents cr the x:akh\iaas. To enforce the Diving Eiiles it is sometimes necessary to punish persona who dis-obey them. H. £. Shaikh Easaad does not 4b support the courts in doing this. An important intention of the Reforms wasmm mrling Industry Bahrain, Contd. ■15- was that advances, especially the fesiram, should be gradually reduced# neither the Divers theiaselves or tho Wifrhuarta like this so l^tely/k^ H. &amp;« Shaikh Hamad has refrained from reducing them« a reduc tion was made in the r i}eakam last year, and resulted in a demonstration trom the divers. Since then no reductions have been made# The aovernment gets very little credit for the Diving Reforms; the Divers themselves do not appreciate the object of them, the Kakhudas as a whole aislike them, and oaany of the big merchants would prefer the old system of unlimited advances and interest and no proper eccounts between divers and their 13 akhude s • L0« ACCOUMS. Since the Reforms each Uakhuda has to keep two accounts. !• Greneral accounts showing, on credit side the receipts from sale of pearls and on the debit side the nature and amount of every expendiiiure any part of which falls on the crew. ii• An account book showing? each diver's particular account on a separate page.

A number of official diving clerks, appointed by the Qorornment, are authorised to up diving accounts. They have offices in Jianama and in Maharrak and are allowed to charge a 11 iJiaed rate for making- up accounte. 11. SHE MAHKBT. Most of the important buying and selling is done on shore. she* biggest buyers are the Continental merchants, Rosenthal and Pack, Mohomedali Sainal fmd his partner Bienenfield, and one or two Indian and Persian merchants. (They usually arrive ^ust after the opening of the main season and leave a week or two after it closes. They pearls are polished and graded in Bombay end then taken to Paris end london for sale to English and American buyers. if more big buyers came from Surope local prices would be higher and Bahrstin would profit at the expense of the pearl buying public of Europe and America, Possibly easier communication betweenIIndustry Bahrein, Contd -17- between Europe and the East, especially by Air, and improved lirii^ nonditione in Bahrein will Indueo more buyers to ccme here in the future* Hone of the buyers pey cash do^n# Some times paymnnts are not corapletod until the following ssason but usually half ia paid on purchase and the rest three or four months later. i2* BBOKSBS.

Reference item 5 in my letter Ho.622-S, dated 10th ITovemher 1923, ahout Bahrain reforms. The Persian Gulf Gazetteer mentions that the number of pearling hoats was estimated at 917 boats employing 17,500 men. This estimate was made in 1905 or thereabouts and I expect these estimates are now largely exceeded. I should be glad if you will have careful enquiries made and give me an estimate of the number of boats and men employed in the pearl Industry now. In any case do you think that a small Department of the Bahrain Government could compete with keeping the accounts of so many nakhudas and divers? I am rather doubtful whether it could do so efficiently in the short time at its disposal viz about a month to 6 weeks before and after the pearling season.

In their telegram ¥o. 315-S of 8th February (enclosed herewith) Foreign stated that Government are await -ing mjit proposals about the reform of the diving rules. As you know, I am rather of the opinion that the reforms outlined in paragraph 5 of your memorandum No. 208-C dated 17th December 1923 and repeated to Government in my Express Letter Ho. 712-S dated 21st December 1923, are too drastic and,in point of fact, lead to too much interference by the State in the Pearling Industry. Apart from this I do not know that there is sufficient time to introduce it before the pearling season. In a communication some little iime ago I myself outlined a scheme which may or may not be feasible, and I repeat it somewhat amplified below. Perhaps something on these lines might be tried this year and if it is not successful the other scheme of creating a separate State Department to run the Pearling Industry might be tried. The scheme I suggest is roughly this : - Shaikh Hamad should issue a proclamation stating that for some time past it has come to his knowledge that grave abuses exist in the pearling industry in Bahrain, particularly the slackness of the nakhudas in keeping accounts, the result of which is that divers cannot obtain theirtheir just dues. He therefore orders that all nakhudas should keep regular accounts which should begin with 'Guffal' 1923. The accounts should 'be drawn up on the lines of the sample account attached to the notification and should consist of a general account for the whole of the Hakhudafe transactions, together with separate accounts for each diver and hauler; each of the latter should 'be given a small book containing a certified copy of this account. The amounts carried forward on to these accounts should be verified either from his previous account or by oath before the ^azi or by agreement between nakhuda and diver. The proclamat- -ion might go on to say that ignorance of letters or figures on the part of the nakhudas will not be accepted as an excuse for incorrect or improperly made out accounts, that Hakhudas must engage clerks if they cannot do the accounts themselves, a big nakhuda a special clerk and the small nakhudas a share of a clerk. Finally he could say that a diver asking to have his account settled before the Salifah or the Q.azi has the right to call upon the nakhuda to produce his accounts for the information of the Court, and that any nakhuda refusing to produce his account will be non-suited and the case given against him, that is to say, the diver will be held not to be indebted to the nakhuda and will receive a clear 'barwah' from the ^oint 6ourt,which will see that divers with such barwahs are not debarred from getting employment. Rough specimen forms of accounls are attached, 'hey are possibly quite unsuitable but might be modified to suit the circumstances and the business. The main thing is3\ \ / is to have an intelligible form of accounts and to insist on the Hakhudas keeping their accounts up in it and producing them when called upon to do so 'by a Court, xlease consult Shaikh Hamad and the Qazi and other experienced persons and see whether something of this sort cannot be done forthwith in time for the coming Pearling Season.

Presume the work will be almost confined to date gardens, and that therefore an Indian Officer with Tapu or revenue experience in Iraq would be preferable. Your further report on reform of the pearling industry is awaited. Your action regarding camel pound is approved of. The expediency of increasing the Customs dues at the present juncture seems doubtful, at least until the improved landing arrangements etc. bring about a reduction in prices. Having regard to the financial position and the recent appointment of a Customs Director, do you consider it an immediate necessity ? The appointment of an Assistant Political Agent is under consideration, and you will receive a further communication about the education of Hamad's sons.

No. 58-S /Oc? political ac^ X&amp;&amp;XXX K U A I Q6th February 1924 /ly dutsz ' In continuation of my telegram No # 46-S or 16th February I have made pretty extensive inquiries amongst the actual nakhudas and divere, and as far as I can say, I think the average diver's share works out at about Rs,§0©/~ for the i.e. the sambuk, lar^e shu'ai, batil,5:0. A Kuwait diver in a small boat does not come off nearly as well, but that seeme to be chiefly because the small boats potter about on the very inferior ftai&amp;a near kone where they naturally do not do so well. As this will not a PP^f to you, I have thought it better to ignore the small boats in eij calculations, I presume the divert share is arrived at in the same way in both places, but, to make sure, the ordinary Kuwait method is: first the 'khums al-mahmal' or owner of the boat *8 fifth share is deducted; then the '•machilah' or run ning expenses. The balance is then divided up, the saib Setting twice / and the diver three times as much as the radhifj The nakhuda sets one diver's share, and one divert share goes to the Shaikh, ^aior C, K, Daly, Political Agent, Bahrain,,3 From - Political Resident, Persian Gulf. To - Foreign, Delhi. Ho. 27-T dated 13th March 1924. Bahrain K'efomis. Pearlim? Industry . My endorsement 125-S of 15th February. Political Agent has consulted Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla and all agree that accounts on the lines I have suggested can be introduced^ and that it would be advantag- -eous to do so forthwith in time for this season. Accordingly I am telegraphing to Political Agent to get Shaikh Hamad to issue the necessary orders. The Shaikhs consider that the nakhudas will not like sharing actual sale value of pearls for fear they should be taxed proportionately - a divert share being taken as tax in most states. To obviate the chance of fraud and collusion between nakhudas and divers to falsify the sale value of pearls the Shaikhs have decided to charge a regular license fee on pearl boats based on the average diver ! £ share gained by such boats, but a great deal less. The average for a good sized boat in Kuwait is considered to be about Ks 500/- and the Shaikhs propose to levy license fees in the graces according to the size of the boats commencing at is 250/- for the large boats - This will be much less than charged by other Shaikhs, but a clear gain in Bahrain where for many years no regular tax has been levied on pearling boats. In anticipation of sanction I am authorizing the Political Agent to agree to Shaikh Hamad proceeding with thethe licensee for the coming season. 2. As another reform the Shaikh proposes to start a hospital Dhow to tour round the pearl banks, and requires a Sub Assistant Surgeon to be in charge. The expenses of this boat have been entered in the budget: the only difficulty is the Sub Assistant Surgeon. Could Government aid the Shaikh by appointing a regular Sub Assistant Surgeon for foreign service in Bahrain for this duty ? He should be a Mohommedan, and must be a good sailor, preferably a man who has served on ships. He should be prepared to stay at least t?/o years, as it will take him some time to learn the language and get into the v/ork. Salary proposed 150/- per mensem plus 53 25/- per mensem when out with the Pearling Fleet. This man to be any use this season should be nominated at once. In the off season the Cub Assistant Surgeon would assist the Assistant Surgeon in change of the Victoria Memorial Hospital who has now a good deal of work. The Shaikh proposes to make him the Official Doctor and pay him v a fixed retaining fee for this duty, as well as his salary for Quarantine work. The Residency Surgeon considers the scheme for a Hospital Dhow a very good one and entirely approves of the suggestion that the Assistant Surgeon should be the official . m doctor and supervise the Hospital Dhow as well as the Victoria J &amp;emorial Hospital. As mentioned above I am authorizing Major Daly to get Shaikh Hamad to proceed with the ne¥/ system of accounts and the licensing pearling dhows at once in anticipation of sanction in order to bring the system into operation this season. WithWith the same object in view in the case of the Hospital Dhov/ will Government be pleased to select a Sub Assistant Surgeon as soon as possible ? Sd/- A. P.

At the same time as Muhammad bin Subah has such a document the Shaikh recognises w that he is worthy of some consideration so as an act of grace and as a special case he will be pleased to allow h}.m.

At the tima tha two documents in question were given,there was no regular taxation.The Shaik took taxes when he could &amp; let off verybody of whom he was afrald^not only this tribe,but they seem ;ha only people .who took the precaution to get a document from him, ,,j i H They now ^sk fori he Huler to adhere to the old arrangenant.

A portion of the tribe v hich settled at Dsrin used formerly to be inmune from tt xrtion,bnt 1^ st year Bin aaud started collecting from them,so that they have not far to look: Dr precedent .Whatever is clone they are sure to gramble.but I think If they gat this concession they are fortunate.To let the whole of this tribe off taxation.for no really valid reason,except that 3haik Sasa was unable to collect the tax formerly,while collecting from til others would be a negation of the policy already laid down by Government.I have told M ahrmniad Bin 3ubah who also applied to me, ^ Shaik Hamad that I ^ould refer the matter to you.I shall be glad to learn whetehr you approve of the proposal put forward &amp; if so whether I may advise the 3haik: accordingly.ohaik Hamad is not desirious of letting them off f but I imagine wants an excuse for cancelling the old agreement.

The Political Agent, Bahrain Pearling Customs . mmiwtvm , Your memorandum 89-C dated 31st March 1924. I think that interest at a good high rate is legitimately chargeable 'by merchants to Nakhudas, as the Pearling Industry is a hazardous and risky business - if the season is a bad one or if there is a slump in the pearl f I I markets the lenders may have to wait for years for their I money or at all events to get complete repayments. Then again Kakhudas when making advances to divers may reasonably j expect interest at a good high rate; as you say, the divers have not earned the money; death, sickness or wilful absence may prevent their ever earning it. The f tisqam f is purely and simply something for the divers to live on in the off season. ^heuretically they should be able to in live during the off season by their earnings taring the diving season but of course they never can and the last thing the Nakhudas want is for them to do so. With a view to ascertaining the practice in other places I tele- -graphed to the Political Agent, Kuwait, to ascertain and let me know the usual rate of interest on such advances in uhat place, but ^ajor J/iore says it will take some time so I cannot wait for the information; I am asking him to send you a copy of his letter direct. I agree with you in thinking that the interest on 1 Salaf ff Salaf f should be less than that on *TisqaBi', and in view of i the relative time 'before it is possible for the advance to be repaid - i.e. at Qaffal - I think the interest might well be double. If the interest charged at Kuwait comes to about the same and if the Hakhudas can show no valid reason why a higher rate should be charged, I think the rates suggested by you viz. for ^isqam 1 and 7t% for ^alaf* would do very well, but if the Nakhudas prove they cannot get advances at this rate perhaps it might be arranged to charge 1^% per mensem up to guffal on these advances, i.e. on say 11 and 5 months which would come to about 16j&gt; and Is it proposed to have a reformed Salifah Court or Mejlis to deal with disputes over accounts or will the ordinary courts decide such cases. ?

Tajars (traders) do not assist the Makhudas and the ^akhudas are not fit for work for this reason# The if&amp;spirit of diving is spoilt and wa gain no profit at all on account of disadvantages and f troubles which have overtaken us from the Government. If a diuer has a claim against a iiakhuda, he should pay him without any dispute but on the other hand, the -Makhuda has no assistance to encourage him against the divers. For this reason the divers having beoBme desperate have overcome the Kakhudas, therefore, we are surprised indeed in all the troubles inflicted on us without any consideration. When the trouble pressed us we found no alternative than to t ke recourse towards those in authority. The diving conversation is stopped at present and it is an , opportunity for us to explain to the Government the following facts clearly which gave much trouble to the subjects and of course spoils the diving expedition f ■ il ■' Despite we had to cure and bore all troubles and hateful /I j things the divers had overcome us.

Therefore the confusion in the diving shall be greatest trouble to the subject as well to the merchants, diving cr®ws and the Nakhudas, as the diving equally concern everybody even the • Therefore we are requesting the Governnent to mercifully remove all the troubles and to allow us to resume our previous diving system. As regards the diving crews and the i*a ! 'hudas in diving service, the divers should obey the Makhudas and not to refuse his order and if the divers did any wrong the ^akhudas should be authorised to punish him. The abouve mentioned troubles have already overtaken us, but we request the Government to mercifully renew the following difficul difficulties at present within us. (l) That the diver should obey the Hakhuda on the sea and land and if the jNakhuda did anything wrong to him he (diver) should b^ allowed to complain of it, but the Hakhuda should be allowed to punish the diver if he disobeyed by the diver. (B) That the Hakhuda should have the power to arrest the absconded diving crews. (5) That if the diver failed to kee? Ms promise, the Makhuda should be entitled to arrest arid wunish him. The Government has already decided that in case the diver failed to keep u^ his promise the Kakhuda should complain agatinst him. It is very difficult for the Kakhuda to do so during the diving season as his delay on shore would cause him monetary loss. (4) That the deduction from the Makhudas money for the diver as it was carried out last year, is also the greatest trouble to us. In case the Government concurs with us in the above mentioned questions and grants us resumption of the previous system, the conditions of the diving as stated above will result in goodness and the country will prosper. The Takers also will be able to oftllect their money and help the A&lt; akhudas but only on condition that the diving crews may not interfere in the sale of pearls, so that the Makhudas can sell the pearls to the Tajere without anyany objection froni the divers, &amp;r ri^ht to canoell the sale of the The Nakhuda should be reco? divers.

Prideaux, C .E.I., C.I.S., Hon^le the Political Hesident in the Parsian Gulf, B u £ h i^ r e. Reforns in the pearling Industry . Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith a petition frora a number of influential diving nakhudae of Bahrain, setting forth eone grievances in regard to conditions prevailing at present in the pearling industry as a result of the measures institute in 1924 for the Heform of the industry. I These measures comprised:- (1) The abolition of the old Salifah Court. (2) Rules regulating financial relations between pearling nakhudas and their crews contained in the proclamation issued by Shaik Hamad in 1924, a translation of which was forwarded to you under this office letter No. 170/9/5, dated i2th July 1924 The signatories of the attached petition pray for re consideration of two points only in connection with the above measures (1) The abolition of the Salifah Court. (2) The sale of pearls with the consent of 8/5rds of the crew. The remaining points dealt with in the petition are matters on which no definite decision has yet been made either by H. M. Government or by Shaik Hamad himself by proclamation, although the general line taken by the Court in cases which havehave cone before it, U, fa ^ ^7 f t j^n^K Kvu) hp jti*** • In view of Major Daly'e imminent return to Bahrain, I am ii# onli not in a position to venture any detailed conmentB on raeaeuree ^ of reform which have already T^een instituted in the pearling industry during his incumbency as Political Agent. It may not however 'be out of place for me to submit for your consideration : !,rl5 ' one or two points which have become apparent to me during my experience of this years pearling season in Bahrain. it# t 0 ItlftlW In regard to the abolition of the Salifah Court, I will venture only to remark that my experience of tho diving caees with which I have had to deal is that the restitution of a reformed kind of Lalifah Court is a necessity, both from a point of view of equity and also from the fact that public opinion will sooner or later demand it. iKjlilDi I do not think that it is within the power of the ordinary Court of Justice to deal fairly with some of the complicated differences which arise between diver and nakhuda, »cl nakhuda and nakhuda and nakhuda and Tajar, without the assistance and adtice of a body of men who enjoy universal respect in Bahrain, and w o are well versed in local diving custom# mJi pnl toilTii M IflU] lie iU If it would be possible for H.M.Government to define the main principles by which these men should be guided in their decisions, and if the Political Agent and Sheikh Hamad were ^ given all the powers of appeal and revision from those decisions in cases of necessity, I do not think there would be any serious danger of the old oppressions and malpractices creeping back I into the industry. At the sane time much discontent among the nakhudae and Tajars, wbo after all control the industry) would he removed and the iiallfah body would he in a poeition to advise the 'overnment in regard to further measures for the srooth working of the industrv* | The sale of pearls with the consent of 2/5rdE of the crew, /.v-.-v. pit# : )1KI 'H ! «il c tt) B! ll ''on,M though theoretically unassailable, is In practice a conei- derable hardship on the nakhuda. In the pearl trade bargain© can only be made by tyuk astute 'haggling 11 with a would-be purchaser and by closing suddenly with a favourable offer• If the nakhuda is hanpered by having to consult g/^rds of his , crew, who are mostly ignorant of the market value of the pearls, he is precluded from making a good bargain. On shore, U ' ' . . „ ■ , ' when the diving season is over, the divers scatter almost atonce to their homes and nakhudas have to my knowledge in many cases had the greatest of difficulty in assenblin.? 2/^rdE of their crew for a sale of the pearls, and in many cases they have lost valuable opportunities in doing so. I venture to think that there is in the present petition a suggestion which is well worth consideration. If at the beginning of t e diving §§ §§§ season, the crew were to elect by a majority vote a limited number of their own fellows to represent their interests in the sale of the pearls throughout the diving season, much of the difficulties now experienced by the nakhuda would be alleviated, and the interests of the / crew woul be adequately protected. I would suggest that one representative for every 10 or fraction of ten of the crew would be sufficient. In regard to the regaining points raised in the petition 1 would suggest that the duties of the diver towards the nakhuda on shore and at sea, during the diving season and immediately before and afterwards be defined in a proclamation by Bheikh Hamad. ^ueBtions such as the arrest of mm runaway divers and the postponement of ordinary disputes till after the etui of the diving season might be similarly dealt with in the same proclamation. I submit the above suggestions merely from a desire to record my improssions and experiences during the late diving season and no object of embarassing . ?

British Hesidency &amp; Conbulate-General, -Busiiire, the ii5rd December i926« Please refer to the last paragraph of your D.O. letter Wo.C.140, dated the 18th December 1926, regarding some rule limiting the amount of Tisqanu Colonel Prideaux desires me to say that it is not quite clear to what you are referring, as we are not aware of any rule limiting the amount of Tisqam . perhaps you refer to para 9 of Shaiich Hamad's proclamation, a copy oi which was lorwarded by Daly with his memorandum Ho.l70/9/i, dated the 12th July 1924, in which the interest to be charged is limited to 20^. If it is as we surmise, and you consider tha't a case has been made out for altering, or relaxing, this maximum. Colonel Prideaux suggests that you should consider what the effect would be if, instead of a lump sum of 20%, a maximum rate of £er month were to be fixed. This would result in the naJshodas being able to charge their divers a larger sum as interest if the latter could not repay their Tisqam punctually owing to a bad season, and would also protect the divers who repay their advances punctually in a good season. This rate would also apply to the salaf advances# Colonel Prideaux would liiie your views on this# J.Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.K., Political Agent,Ko.C / Political Agencj # i^ate the let Janua fVV Please refer to your demi-official dated the 23rd December last.

He had hearly 5 years experience behind him when he wrote this letter, Please turn to page 4 of this letter and read from the words 'The State is at present aiming at the gradual elimination of the system whereby the divers are kept permanently in debt'. This will show you why the system of limiting Tisqam was started. Last year the rate of Tisqam was Rs.100/- for the ditfer and Rs.80/- for the puller. This year Shaikh Haaad delayed fixing the Tisqam and on my asking the reason he told me that the delay was due to the absence of Belgrave, whom he wished to consult. Belgrave triert diving cases. Just before the return of Belgrave the llakhodas petitioned Shaikh Hamad for certain reforms in the diving rules Shaikh Hamad sent their petition to me and also gave me a list of 22 persons connected with the diving industry, and asked if I would like to consult them, as I told him frankly that I had tried no diving cases and did not consider myself^competent adviser on the custojiary laws relating to diving.

One or two other matters which worked badly in practice were also discussed such as the right of a diver to hold up all diving woric and bring a pearling boat to Bahrein in order to settle a squabble with his Hakhoda. I told Shaiich Hamad that I sa. no reason why minor ad justments should not be made provided nothing was done which might lead in any way to the virtual enslavement of free men or the cheating of the divers by neglect in keeping up their accounts ^whiclt were the main points I wished to watch. One of the points to which objection was taken was the right of a two thirds majority of the crew of a pearling boat to veto the sale by the Nakhoda of their catch. The right which was conceded by ^aly seems to have worked very badly in practise. The actual divers have never had any connection with the pearl trade and know nothing regarding the value of their catches. It was proposed that the former practise of leaving the sale wholly in the hands of the Kakhoda should be revived, and that the crew should have no knowledge of the transactions and no right of interference, I objected to this on the ground that it would revive the old scandals which resulted from the wholesale cheating of the crews, 1 suggested as an alternative that the right ol veto should be cancelled but that no sale should be valid unless made in the presence^o^ with the knowledge,of 4 men elected by the crew, who should sign or impress their thumb impressions as witnesses of the sale. I explained that the object of this was to ensure that all the proceeds reached the persons who were entitled to them instead of sticking to the palms of the Kakhoda, Belgrave came back tfcday after I sent Shaikh Hamad this reply but still the question of of Tis^am hung fire. About a fortnight ago Shaikh Hamad sent me a further commu nication which contained a list of articles which the Kajchodas:proposed should^guide ^nnrtp, The fj that Tisqam should be free but that Sails the orders of the Bahrein Government.

The firat on this list was that Tisqam should be free but that Sallaf should be limited by the orders of the Bahrein Government. Shaikh Abdullah at Shai-fch Hamad's request came to discuss these articles with me. He agreed with me that there was no differentiation between Tisqam and Saliaf. I asked Shaijch Abdullah to tell Shaijch Hamad to proceed with the iixing ol the amounts of Tisqam, setting if he liked a maximum below which the Hakhoda and his crew would be at liberty to come to an agreement, but X said that something should be done as the crew and their families had to live and they relied on Tisqam for maintenance. Shaikh Hamad appears to have conferred with the merchants and then went off hawking. Three or four days ago Belgra/e informed me that the Tisqam had been fixed at Rs.SC)/- for divers and Rs.60/- for pullers, and that these amounts were considerea by the divers to be very low. I informed Belgrave that 1 also considered them too low. The next move was that on Thursday 50th December about 200 divers marched out to Sukhair where Shaikh Hamad was hawking to asii him to increase the amount of the Tisqam. Shaikh Hamad appears to have promised to give the matter consideration, and fixed the divers up with some sort of accommodation for the night. Yesterday nothing happened. This morning being Kew Year day Shaikh Ksa, who has also been out hawking for ohe past week, came in to call on me bringing a large number of his family including Shaixh Hamad. After the departure of Shaikh Esa for Muharraq, ShaikhsjHamad and Abdullah, who had seen him off^ returned to the Agency and told me about the visit of ohe divers to Sukhair and asked me if I thought the Tisqam was too low. I said that the divers and their families relied on the Tisqam for maintenance and to pay past debts and that it was certainly too low. They then agreed to raise it to iis.100/- and 80/^, being the same as last year and also to arrange, in the case of men, the whole of whose money went to repay past debts, that the merchants should advance them rice until the Saliaf.

Beigrave was present at the latter end of this interview and he and Shaikh Hamad departed together for the Customs House, where they had some work. On arrival there thej found the ^00 divers assembled waiting for their answer. Instead of sneaking to them himsell bhaiich Hamad who was anxious to leave for his hawking sent them a message hji some saying that he would meet 6 ol their representatives on Monday and give them his reply. He himself drove off in his motor for Hukhair. After his departure the 200 divers v^alked into the Manama market and coramenced a littl^verylooting. I have not got an estimate of the damage done, but it does not appear to have been very serious. As soon as Belgrave got to know of what was happening he sent word to Robinson who marched a squad of his men into the bazaar whereupon al4. was peace. In the meantime I was holding the annual majlis at the Agency and in the miadle of the congratulatory speeches my Interpreter brought me news that 'the divers are looting the Bazaar'. Parke was present at the Agency and I told Shaikh All to inform him. jife- promptly went off to the Customs House and arrived in time to see the divers sail for ^luharraq. It chanced that a guard of his armed police intended for Muharraq was all ready to sail. He despatched them at once with orders to prevent mischief. The divers on arrival at iLuharraq went to the house of an usurer, helped themselves to his rice and destroyed his records. They were on the point of marching down the bazaar when Parked guard turned up, whereupon they all ran away. Six were arrested and being foreigners have been sent to me for disposal. These are the facts so far as I have been able to ascertain them at present. The divers seeing to have behaved like naughty schoolboys rather than men determined to be nasty, but I have no doubt that we shall obtain a large numoer of false claims as well as a few true ones.

H.B.M's Political Agent. Bahrain. Sir. With reference to the question of the use of motor launches for * tawash H work I have the honour to acquaint you with the following facts. The matter is an important one and concerns most of the people in the diving industry so it is causing a great deal of feeling in that community at present. About half a dozen big pearl merchants have recently let it be known that they propose using motor launches for going out to the banks to buy pearls. Foremost among them are the ^usaibis, subjects of Ibn Saoud. This has resulted in a petition from a number of the leading men in the pearl trade requesting the Shaikh to forbid the use of launches for w tawash' work. The gist of the petition is as follows. Bahrain depends entirely on the pearl trade which provides livelihoods for thex rich and the poor. People who go out to the banks have equal chances of buying. If launches are used the owners 'will gain a great advantage over those y /ho have none, they will be able to move from place to place with greater rapidity, on a calm day they will be able to go out and to buy up all the pearls» as the sailing boats will not be able to move if there is no wind. Karhudas will sell to launch owners because the sail boat H Tawashin H wont be able to get to them. Launches will break up all the old rules of the trade. ( It is recognised that the firstcomer has the right to board a pearling boat and that until he has finished his deal nobody else may board that boat.) launches will make trade uneven giving all the chances to the rich men. ( Presumably now a days a small man sometimes gets the chance of buying well merely because he is on the spot and no one No X* U . o'* . • o • . . y . .«elee is there to compete.) If launches are used the majority will suffer and the claim of the majority should be admitted. Many of the petitioners are rich men and can easily buy launches but ou t of consideration to the feelings of the small men they are against the introduction of launches.( Some of them actually .own launches now.) In 1338 Shaikh Isa forbade a Bahrfe^Arabf^ho was personally a great friend of Shaikh Isa's, to use a launch for ' tawash ' ( The launch was a small steam boat ) The petition -ers request the Govt to take similar action now and to forbid the use of launches. Others of the petitioners say that if launches are to 'be used fair notice should have been given to the public. The owners reply that on certain occasions during the last two years launches have been used for tawash, also the public could have seen for itself that they were building launches, they made no secret of it. The petitioners say that the Govt should have announced xX that 4 launches were permitted in viey/ of the fact that the Govt forbade them before. This is quite a sound argument. The owners argue that trade is free and that launches are a step forward in the path of progress. They say also that the petition is the result of personal jealousy. This I think is absurd considering the status of many of the signatories. They point out that even if the Bahrain Govt prevented its subjects from using them foreigners would use launches in the Gulf. They say, with the exception of Ali bin Seggar who admits that launches will injure the poorer men, that they will make no profit from their use but only want them in order to be more comfortable and for the sake of convenience. They compare the rapid adoption of motors in Bahrain in place of donkeys to the question of launches. Personally I think that the fact 6f the ^usaibis being pro launch has a deal to do with Shaikh Hamed f s attitude in this matter- Shaikh Hamed is entirely in favour of the launches being allowed.163 My own opinion is that launches are certain to be used in the future probably fox pearling as well as for M tawash 11 • the beginning the people who can afford to use them will score over those who work in sailing boats. No preventitive measures would be any use unless they applied to all the diving communities in the Gulf. It would be very difficult to forbid everyone to use launches at the pearl banks. If the people from Bahrain do not use them foreigners will have an advantage over them. If a temporary order is issued now forbidding the people of Bahrain to use them they will see that foreigners who are not restricted have an advantage over them and they will then realise that it is inevitable that they should be universally used. The agitation against launches is similar to many other agitations against mechanical progress in this part of the world and in Europe. I have the honour to be Sir Your obedient servant. Adviser.

I presume, it will be a simple matter to bbtain Trucial Coast views but it will be more difficult to bbtam an opinion from Bin Saud, who is interested as Euler of Qatif. I think the best method would be^if the Politjcal Real dent a^ees^for me to write a friendly letter to the Amir of Qatif asking for his ideas on the subject. I am doubtful what view* Bin Saud* to whom the Amir would have to refer, would take of this action, which is at present a matter of purely Gulf interest ami as such a fit object for an exchange of ideas between local ofrioars, I note that here again is a matter which would bo simplified by the grant of Consular powers for QMlf arid Hasa, to the Political Agent, Bahrein.

U.EiTranalation of arttcla published in the 'Majalt ^O, or the months of Shauwal &amp; Bhul i^a.^dah - ^ ic at fi+JUatU , At the time when progress and reform takes place in all the parts of the world for the developments of the means of existence we see that some of the prominent merchants of Bahrain had made up their mind to make a 9 progress as well. They particularly want to make a change in their vessels which carries them all over the sea for the purpose of purchasing pearls from the divers. Some of those mercnants wanted to replace the sail^ which is one of the oldest and isgL of no use to the boat except when the wind is in its favour, by fixing engines to their boats to enable them to travel in the sea at any time they liked. It is a good idea and a lar^e.step toward s the reform of divi ng. However, some of the other merchants did not like the ideafhence they made a representaion to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad the (Deputy) Ruler of Bahrain to the effect that the idea of those merchants will be of damage and great harm to them as it will also place the whole trade in the hands of few merchants. That in the interest of justice and protection of rights,people who are of Jhe same nation and observe the same law, should be treated equally. This was about to have its effect on His Excellency had not the other party explained their stronger reasons. They said to His Excellency that H Your Excellency knows that trade is free at all times and places. That the people still differ in thWr commercial views and the way they choose to take them to their objects. That it would be s unfair for us to be prevented from what we want to ao toward the reform of trade. Supposing you listen to thtir complain J about this^ would^not be fair then to liear the complaint of of the owners of ferries which carry people from Muhaaraq to Manamah, should you build a bridge across the two islands because it is a loss to them ?. If .you prevent us today from doing what we want oan ypu prevent the foreigners who come2 from outside for tawashing among our divers such as the Kuvfait.^atar, and Oman merchants J. If, as it is, trade is free and Your Excellency cannot prevent them it would he a loss to us if we alone were to be prevented. Tlie argument of this party had changed the idea of His Excellency who realized that the first party were right in their idea xmixjtaxxxkKLKi which should be adopted without listening to the object^raised by the others, fie however, aid not give his final decision on the subject , • , .Ho Transikation of letter dated 3rd Rabi» 11 ,1347 i.e. 18-9-28 from His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa al-Khalifah,C.S.I., Deputy Ruler of Bahrain to Lieut *Colonel C.C.J.Barrett,G.S.I.,C.IS2 H .B.tt 'a Political Agent, Bahrain.

In reply to which 1 be^ to say (a) that the use only of motor launches will have an affect A 0|ji the sBsall merchants who are not able to use them. Whe^i the use of motor launches comes into force iks it would be very easy for the foreigners to find their \my to the pearl banks^.and .when they ao so they are surely going to interfer in the v/ork of the Arabs as far as the purchase at sea of pearls/is concerened.

I think there is a distinct retrograde tenden cy, and Belgrave shares this view. Shaikh Hamad has so distorted a view of the divers real interests, that when I re proached him for his weakness last year and yielding instantly to the demonstration of divers at Muharraq he said in effect rt They are poor men, and it is one*3 duty to be generous to them But for the continued pressure of the Agency conditions would be back where they were before Daly's reformsf and that in one season. There can be no permanent progress till the divers learn to read and write, and this they are now starting to do.

The majority of the correspondence takes place between the Bahrain Political Agent (Clive Day, who was the principle architect of the pearling industry reforms, and served from 1921 to 1926, superseded by Cyril Barrett), the Political Resident or his secretary, and the advisor to the Bahrain Government, Charles Belgrave.The reforms proposed, and which are discussed at length throughout the volume include:Economic reforms, with particular attention given to shares of the profits paid to divers, and the allowances paid to divers, and interest on their debts, through the
                              Salifehcourt. This aspect of the reforms was designed to reduce the state of debt slavery that many divers existed in towards their boat masters (
                              nakhudas);The introduction of accounts books for all pearl divers;Boat registration and pearl fishing licenses;The introduction of a hospital boat intended to patrol the pearling banks, with medical staff on board who are capable of providing medical attention to pearl divers as required;The advantages and disadvantages of permitting pearl merchants to use motor launches to reach the pearling boats, the use of which would place some merchants at an advantage over those travelling under sail power.Items of note in the file include:A report entitled 'The Pearl Industry. Bahrain', written by Charles Belgrave, undated but probably 1928 (folios 3-23);Letters from the Director of the Bahrain Customs House to the Political Agency (1924), giving figures for the numbers of boats registered and pearling licenses issued, and the income generated (folios 51, 71, 84);A original petition in Arabic, signed by numerous
                              nakhudas, complaining of the reforms, dated 26 September 1925 (folio 123, English translation on folios 124-26);A letter written by Barrett to Horner (the Secretary to the Political Resident), dated 1 January 1927, writing of disturbances in Manama, caused by a crowd of two-hundred pearl divers who are unhappy with reductions in their allowances (folios 149-52);</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Political reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Law reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000363#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
