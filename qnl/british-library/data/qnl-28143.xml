I had hoped that it would reach your Lordship in January or February, but this unfortunately proved impossible.

IN the course of The lyluv s Speech at the prorogation of Parliament on the 4th November, His Majesty s said:— 2. ' The cordial 'i-cper?'::n in matters of common interest between my Government and the Groveraineiit of Egypt has been amply confirmed during recent months.' The reference was to the time of international tension in September when the Treaty of Ain ant t-.- of 1936 was put to the test and was not found wanting. It is true that, in the calm that followed the storm, there were some Egyptians who attempted to argue at German and Italian instigation, that it would not have been strictly necessary, in view of the wording of article 7 of the treaty, for Egypt re-.ome actively engaged as allies in hostilities in which Great Britain might become involved. But they were a small minority and though -r included some persons ot repute in Egypt, the facts were too strong and the • '-Tp or , atta ^ : by Italy too menacing for casuistry of this sort to have any v*- In an h/ ja f .- the argument had little if any influence with the IT ; yih . h.T. ^ threat of war be&lt; ame daily more real they placed reaan(: * } on t ^ e dispositions of His Majesty’s Government and a right wlthoil t T uestlon - They considered that ^ ^ P rc j m ptly informed of ail developments in * tfe atittmlo IvOI i ^ on to meet this demand.

This was not possible, owing mainly to the unrest in Palestine where several units of the normal British garrison in Egypt were stationed and whence they could not easily or rapidly be withdrawn so long as the Arab rebels continued successfully to defy the Govern ment. The situation in Palestine was, indeed, a matter of the utmost concern on strategical grounds throughout the whole year. It placed the Egyptian Government in a very awkward position and complicated their day to day relations with the Embassy; it tended to detract from the mutual confidence which was essential for the implementation of the treaty; it was a happy hunting ground for the anti-British propagandist who did not shrink from endeavouring to enlist the sympathies of powerful Moslem divines in Egypt and elsewhere; and finally it denuded Egypt of much needed British troops just at a moment when their presence at their normal stations was most necessary. It was with relief therefore that signs were detected at the end of the year of movements to produce if not a permanent settlement, at least a temporary lull in hostilities in Palestine. 4. The Prime Minister’s lot was not a happy one. The elections which confirmed him in office had been shamelessly ‘ c rigged ’ ’ and had anything like a referendum been possible it is safe to assume that the country as a whole would have been found to be still pro-Wafd. None knew this better than Nahas Pasha and Makram Ebeid Pasha who naturally set themselves to exploit the fundamental weakness of the Government’s position. For them, whatever the Government did was wrong, no matter what the intrinsic merits of their actions. All the Govern ment’s faults were conned by rote and set down in the Wafdist press with nauseating iteration from day to day. Nor was Wafdist criticism restricted to the Government’s faults. Even when Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha successfully negotiated with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom an amendment of the treaty which was patently in Egypt’s favour, it was written up as a sin against him because he had dared to modify the terms of an instrument which in Wafdist eyes was sacrosanct for purposes of publicity. No question of principle was involved in the campaign; it was recognised on all sides as being merely the outward and visible sign of the desire of the two residuary Wafdist protaganists to return to office and they were aided and abetted by the Senate where the Wafd was still strong. This Chamber missed no opportunity to obstruct the Govern ment’s programme with the result that the session of Parliament, though one of the longest on record, was barren of progressive legislation. In the end, the Wafd overplayed their hand and lost a good deal of the sympathy which might have been theirs had they ceased to be less noisily provocative and maintained a dignified silence. 5. Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha was not their only victim; His Majesty’s Government and the Embassy also came under the lash of their invective. Their thesis seems to have been that His Majesty’s Government were not unwilling to see a weak Government in Egypt so that they could pursue their selfish aims in spite of the treaty. They had consequently connived at the advent of Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha and the humiliation of Nahas Pasha. Time and again the words and the actions of the Wafd betrayed the conscious weakness of their attacks, but Makram Ebeid Pasha had evidently concluded that, while it may be impossible to fool all the people all the time there is no harm m trying; and that there is much to be said for harping continually on one string. Ihat the string chosen happened to be the treaty was largely fortuitous. It was alter all the bmeest thing in Egyptian public life and had been so for the first two momentous’yearsof Egypt’s' independence. It had been the Wafd's creataon of which they were justly proud and they hated the thought of any Egyptian outside their ranks getting the kudos for its application m harmony with the other partner—Great Britain. There has not yet been time for them to realise that with the signature of the treaty, the Wafd’s real rmson d'etre disappeared They will need an infusion of new blood before regaining their former position and^it says a great deal for Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha that, m September, he Tas williim to bring Nahas Pasha into the Cabinet if necessary to serve under him in order to create a united Egyptian front. a Ti uf t he Wafd were not the only ones who tried to put a spoke m the Government’s wheel The Palace also jofied in the game, and the Prime Minister [19464] B 24 „ loT , f fl0 .oh is t the foibles and vagaries of the young had to be continually on the aJe g ‘ who wa s desperately keen to step King and the ‘“S^niSportunity.

It was si'miiarlv unfair for them to carp at the lack of any settled Government policy designed to tackle the student problem. Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha at least disbanded the “coloured shirt” organisations and the ebullient manifestations of discontent amongst the students were kept within bounds. No solution of the student problem will ever be possible in Egypt until ]t is made abundantly clear that the goal of graduation is not necessarily black-coated employ and a seat in a Government office. So long as this impression prevails, as it does at present, and so long as the number of Government posts is limited, the students will continue to be restless about their future and will fall an easy prey to the machina tions of the politician. 8. In the realm of positive achievement, the Government introduced legisla tion to increase the revenue by means of taxes on incomes and dues on stamps and inheritances. It was unfortunate for them that they should have been faced with the need for drastic fiscal changes in order to meet the cost of rearmament at a time when prices of their staple exports were falling, and when they were not in a sufficiently strong position to apply a much needed axe to expenditure. It is probably true to say that 1938 was the first year in which Egyptians came to realise that independence carries obligations as well as rights and that it is apt to be costly. The Government also went some way to meet the grievances of the Lancashire industry arising from the great increases in the customs duties on unported cotton piece-goods which had been imposed during Sidky Pasha’s term of office as Minister of Finance. As a result of these increased duties, the imports o -British cotton piece-goods had fallen off, and Lancashire’s complaints were ,T, g h ! s Vlslt to London in the summer, Mohamed Mahmoud h, tte he sltuatlon Wlth representatives of the cotton industry, and to fevto T tte e ;f 1S f f S '° n % W !t e ~ d when a Lancashire delegation came 0 Egypt at the invitation of the Egyptian Government.

The Royal Princess was given the name Ferial. 11. On the 24th May, the King’s sister—Her Royal Highness Princess F'awzia—was betrothed to the Crown Prince of Iran, His Imperial Plighness Mohamed Riza Pahlevi. In June a delegation headed by the Iranian Prime Minister—Mahmoud Djem—visited Egypt to arrange the marriage ceremonies. 12. King Farouk’s attitude towards both internal and external affairs gave rise to some anxiety. His native wit and intelligence were not sufficient to offset his inexperience and lack of a liberal education, while his personal conceit, fostered by a sycophantic court, rendered his day-to-day contacts with Ministers difficult and dilatory. He established a position of natural authority which may one day serve him well, but with it went a tendency to an overbearing intolerance which was resented by those outside the Palace whose task it was to counsel and advise. Inspired by those in his immediate circle, he saw himself as king of the most important State of Islam and unwisely identified himself with a movement to proclaim him Caliph. This movement caused some heartburning in other Islamic States and did nothing to enhance His Majesty’s reputation abroad. It was perhaps natural, in view of his Turco-Albanian descent and his upbringing, that he should wish to rule in none too strict accordance with the Constitution or the wishes of the great majority of the Egyptian people. But in view of the world struggle between the conservative democracies and the dynamic totalitarian States, it was unsafe for His Majesty to afford undue evidence of his desires, and there can be little doubt that he had lost, at the end of the year, some of the popularity with which he began it. His Majesty’s preference for a number of Italians in his household did nothing to arrest the criticism to which he laid himself open, and the policy of Ali Maher Pasha of preventing the King from seeking the advice of the F^mbassy was misguided. At a time when the sinking of party differences was clearly called for, the King was also ill-advised in keeping alive the feud between the Palace and the Wafd. It is only fair to add, however, that in time of real difficulty, His Majesty showed himself ready to co-operate with the Embassy in the Allied cause. There is every reason to believe that he will be more willing to do so as the strength and power of the Empire become more evident. Political Situation. 13. The country reacted calmly to the dramatic dismissal of Nahas Pasha and his Wafdist Ministry at the end of 1937, and the new Government under Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha showed a commendable determination to maintain public order. One of their first steps, on taking office, was to issue an administra tive regulation for the suppression of all “ coloured shirt ” organisations. Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha, at his first interview with the Ambassador, expressed his intention to collaborate loyally with the Embassy in the spirit of the Treaty of Alliance, and stated that he felt confident of his ability to check any unconstitu tional moves on the part of the Palace. 14. Nahas Pasha was not slow in replying to his dismissal, and on the 3rd January published a manifesto setting forth the constitutional differences which had led to the recent crisis and emphasising what he considered to be the real issue; i.e., whether the Palace, or a Cabinet supported by a parliamentary majority should govern. On the same day Parliament was summoned to hear the Royal Rescript proroguing its sittings until the 2nd February. The reading of the Rescript led to an angry scene, in the course of which Nahas Pasha read a motion of non-confidence with the aid of matches after the lights of the Chamber had been extinguished. The Senate in more decorous manner expressed its dis satisfaction with the Change of Cabinet and requested the King to reconsider the position. As a result of these proceedings Dr. Ahmed Maher, Dr. Hamed Mahmud and four other Deputies were expelled from the Wafdist party. These, together with Mahmud Fahmy Nokrashi Pasha and other dissidents immediately set about forming a new party called the Saadist Wafd, and claimed that they alone now represented the true principles of Saad Zaghlul Pasha. The remainder of the month of January was spent in the development of the party situation and in speculation as to whether Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha would be able to secure [19464] B 3. majority -b.

To this petition the Prime Minister replied in a press interview defending his intended appeal to the country and accusing Nahas Pasha of enmity to the King. A similar note was struck in a statement issued to the press by Dr. Ahmed Maher. These statements made, of the coming electoral conflict, a virtual issue between the King and the Wafd with all its obvious dangers to the Throne. The Government lost no time in using its special position to adjust the administrative machine to its own advantage. Several mndirs of doubtful loyalty were replaced by others more calculated to assist them and the most energetic administrator in Egypt—Mahmoud Azmy Bey—was specially appointed to the Ministry of Interior to organise the electoral arrange ments. The most important of these was the redrawing of the constituency boundaries to cope with the increase of population revealed by the 1937 census. This readjustment was used to the great advantage of the Government and to the embai i assment of the Nahas Wafdists, who were unable for some time to discover exactly how the constituencies were to be drawn. Thirty-three new constituencies Vreie, in fact, created, and the majority of the old constituency boundaries were substantially modified. A general increase of pay to all schoolmasters granted at this particular time acted as an obvious inducement to them to use their fiW tPl Side , “ the comin S elections.

As a result of these incidents and the general intimidation to which electors were subjected, the Wafd Parliamentary Committee called a meeting and drew up a petition to the King, which was duly presented on the 14th March by Nahas Pasha to Ali Maher Pasha. Nahas Pasha was accompanied on this occasion by 245 Deputies and Senators in seventy motor cars. The petition accused the Ministry of “ rigging ” the elections and of instituting a reign of terror. It deprecated the introduction of the King’s name into party politics, the active intervention of members of the Royal family and the introduction of religious issues into political questions; and ended with a request for a neutral Ministry to conduct the elections. To this petition no reply was given by the Palace. At the end of the month of March Mohamed Pasha Mahmoud and Nahas Pasha delivered speeches at Mansura and Alexandria. The former attempted, somewhat unconvincingly, to answer the charges which had been made in the Wafdist petition to the King, and defended any arbitrary action on the part of the authorities as being necessary in the interests of public security. Nahas Pasha’s speech was delivered at Alexandria on the 27th March, but, owing to interference with the microphone, very few of the audience heard what he had to say. He criticised the Ministry’s actions severely, and definitely charged them with giving the King false information on the points raised in the Wafd petition. 17. On the 31st March elections took place in Upper.Egypt, and resulted in overwhelming defeats for the Wafdists. Notable Nahasist defeats were Makram Ebeid at Nag Hamadi, Neguib-el-Hilali at Helwan, and Mahmud Bassiuni at Assiout. A number of serious incidents took place at Assiout, Minia and Beirut, resulting in five deaths and the wounding of a Mamur. In one of these the Bedouin chief, Saleh Pasha Lamlun, was shot and killed. Serious rioting also broke out at Tanta during a visit of Nahas Pasha, the police being forced to fire, with the result that five persons were wounded. Elections were held throughout Lower Egypt on the 2nd April. Here again the Wafd met with an overwhelming defeat, all the late colleagues of Nahas failing to retain their seats. The elections in Cairo and Alexandria were conducted in an orderly manner, but there were many incidents in the provinces. All reports showed that every form of pressure was applied to voters to support the Government candidates and to prevent them from voting for the M afd. -The final results were ; • Government Coalition Independents ...

The Prime Minister was anxious to introduce a larger element of Liberal Constitutionalists into the Ministiy, but the King objected on the grounds that the important thing was to appoint the best men available to posts, and that the Liberal Constitutionalists should not claim moie than their fair share of seats. So serious did the situation become that Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha was reported at one moment to have resigned. Eventually the situation was resolved and a new Ministry was formed as under :— Prime Minister and Interior: Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha. Finance : Ismail Sidky Pasha. Foreign Affairs : Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha. War : Hassan Sabry Pasha. Communications : Hilmi Issa Pasha. Education : Hussein Heikal Pasha. Justice : Ahmed Khashaba Pasha. Commerce : Murad Wahba Pasha. Public Health : Ahmed Kamel Pasha. Public Works : Hussein Sirry Pasha. Agriculture : Rashwan Mahfuz Pasha. Wakfs : Sheikh Mustapha Aboul Razek.

He had been obliged to take this step in order to checkmate the intrigues of Ali Pasha Maher. Dr. Ahmed Maher had decided to join the Ministry rather than see all power pass into the hands of the Palace as a result of its collapse. Proposals for a reconstruction of the Ministry were sub mitted to the King on the 23rd June, the main feature of the change being the introduction of five Saadist Ministers into the Cabinet, with Dr. Ahmed Maher and Nokrashi Pasha in the posts of Finance and Interior respectively. 22. On the 24th a Royal Rescript was published appointing the following Cabinet:— Prime Minister : Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha. Foreign Affairs : Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha. Finance : Dr. Ahmed Maher. Communications : Mahmoud Nokrashi Pasha. Commerce and Industry : Maitre Saba Habashi. War : Hassan Sabry Pasha. Education : Hussein Heikal Pasha. Agriculture : Rashwan Mahfuz Pasha. Justice : Ahmed Mohamed Khashaba Pasha. Wakfs : Sheikh Mustapha Abul Razik. Public Works : Hussein Sirry Pasha. 23. The letter to the Prime Minister from the King published with the Royal Rescript laid stress on the essentially democratic spirit of the Egyptian people and on his desire to co-operate with all democratically-minded nations. The letter also indicated the general lines of policy and reform which His Majesty wished to be pursued. In a statement to The Times Cairo correspondent the Prime Minister stated that the recent ministerial changes were designed to set democratic principles on a firm national basis, this was the signal for a spirited return to the charge by Nahas Pasha, who, on the 1st July, addressed a meeting in Cairo, at which he reviewed, in satirical vein, the comedy of the recent elections and ministerial changes. He attacked Prince Mohamed All, Sheikh el Maraghi and Ali Maher Pasha for the part they had played in recent events, and inveighed asainst the Prime Minister, Sidky Pasha, Dr. Ahmed Maher and Nokrashi Pasha, who had intrigued against him. He concluded his speech by demanding new elections held under the segis of a neutral Ministry. 24 Shortly after, relations between the Prime Minister and Ah Maher Pasha became very strained owing to the disclosure of a personal approach made bv the latter to Nahas Pasha with a view to effect a rapprochement. This closure resulted from a statement which appeared in the Misn, and led eventually to a Parquet enquiry, at which the chief actors in the incident had to give evidence The case was finally filed, but it caused at the time a considerable sedation and placed all parties, including His Majesty, m a most equivocal position. 25 On the 15th July Mohamed Pasha Mahmoud left Egypt for England proposals.

Towards the end of the cnsis however, some responsible Egyptians, under the growing fear of Italian aerial bombardment of Egypt and inspired, no doubt, from German sources began to toy with the idea that Egypt might remain neutral in the wai. 1 he feasibility of this notion was strongly contested by the ambassador on bis return from leave and the crisis ended without further development. ^ The evil seed had, however, been sown and was to flower later in the year. The Egyptian people took the crisis with much more equanimity than might have been expected after its obvious panic at the beginning of the Abyssinian crisis. They displayed no sympathy for Germany, but much of their apathy arose from their lack of interest in foreign affairs. The Wafd did its best to stir the populace by depicting Egypt as being dragged at Great Britain’s chariot wheel into a war to serve the latter’s imperialist designs and to point the moral that a minority Government was sacrificing Egypt to Great Britain as a price for being kept in power by the latter. The crisis ended before this campaign had had time to pass from vague generalities to the formulation of a policy opposed to military co-operation with Great Britain. In spite of its apparent violence, there is no doubt that the Wafd would have hesitated to commit itself to a definite policy in conflict with the obligations of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which is still regarded as its own peculiar handiwork. Its leaders continued to attack the Government in and out of season and on every conceivable issue. These attacks and the noisy manifesta tions to which they gave rise led to trouble in October, when Nahas Pasha, Makram Ebeid Pasha and members of the police were injured during disorders which arose out of an attempt by the Wafd leaders to harangue the mob from the Zaghlul statue in Cairo. Sixty persons were subsequently tried for rioting; and received severe sentences. This incident caused intense feeling at the time and many persons were left with the impression that the actual assaults on Nahas and Makram Pashas were not satisfactorily explained. session on P r a P mrr n A,I a8 on the 10th November after the longest numhe, Of wwh C J? 1 ™ 6 m re g ard to legislation, it had witnessed a wT 'E lively debates in both Houses, and especially in the Senate where the Ux law an^ L°IE defeat at the P°Us, were very strong The income oTtle p^llamentZ year ThT 1 * Stamp duties we ’ e the real“ruUs 19th November, when tie soeefh fmJtf^Tu 11 was \ °P ened . by the King on the defence measures and included a referen' 6 E?? 6 d , ea 1 ma ' ri ly with finance and With the embassy dunng the kternaHon ,° the collaboration maintained Minister’s health' gave 'emise foEan xiet^ °, r ^ sls ' A ‘ this time the Prime Ministry and of a failure on the part’orfhe^p 0 wer ® si ? ns of a rift in the colleagues.

The year ended with the international situation tense, the internal political situation unstable and the economic and financial position none too happy. Economic and Financial. 29. The country’s general economy entered on a difficult phase affecting all classes of the population, not excluding the fellah. The local money market reflected the continued low level of cotton prices* the nervousness induced by the international situation, and the increased military expenditure with which hgypt will be faced during the next few years. Humours were current at the end of the year to the effect that the Government had already incurred liabilities beyond their means; that they intended to offload their holdings of Egyptian State bonds; and to float a new loan. These rumours caused a marked fall in the quotations ot Egyptian privileged and unified loans. Reassuring statements by the Minister of Finance did something to allay the fears prevailing in the market, but his efforts were partially offset by heavy liquidation of Egyptian securities in 1 ai is and Brussels. The year closed with falls approaching 20 per cent, m privi leged ” and unified loans, and also in the share quotations of the National Bank as°compared with the level at the end of the preceding year. In spite of these developments, the budgetary position of the Egyptian Government may be considered as sound. The country’s recuperative powers are adequate to ensure recovery from such financial shocks as were felt in 1938. 30 Though cotton prices did not decline much below the low levels i uling in 1937 (except in the case of “ sakel ” which fell a further 14 per cent.) tie 1938 crop (estimated at 7\ million kantars) was much smaller than the record crop of about lOf million kantars m 1937. With receipts at £E. 38,997,000- some £E.2 million higher than in the previous year-and expenditure at £E 42,267,000—about £E. 5,500,000 higher—a deficit of £E 3,720,000 was anticipated. This deficit was due principally to the vote of the °f Wai and Marine which amounted to £E. 6,235,000 as against £E. 3,07o,000 m the preceding year. The estimates of the Egyptian State Railways, Telegraphs and Telephones Administration showed a deficit of 3 ust oyer £E. 1 mil ion. The deficit in the general budget will be met by drawing on the Government s reserve fund, and that in the Railway Administration, by an advance from the same source. 31. In view of the steady rise in State expenditure during the years 1934 39 the Government submitted to Parliament fiscal bills to provide new brmf of taxation—income tax, inheritance and stamp duties but none of t h ee measures had been enacted by the end of the year, Government aRo on cotton piece-goods, -Uon yarns^nd hosiery; ^sonmcases the listing du ^ purchases’of Eoypt^cottonhseeTaragrap^G^S^bli^ussions^erekiuTrfreedSg at the end of the'year on the modus opemndi and the quota system had not been actually introduced. on rhp total value of imports in 1938 (excluding bullion) was JoOO 7s kmpared with £E. 38,016,000 in 1937. Exports totalled f k 28 757 000 against £E 38,665,000 for the preceding year. The visible adverse frtdfblllnce was therefore £E. 8,131,000; 1938 was the first year since 1932 in which the foreign trade exchanges were unfavourable to Egyp . ^ 33.

The Bcdagh took up a less unfriendly attitude but the Wafd press as a whole became hostile This was mainly due to the party’s insistence that the embassy had failed to he p them when help was most needed; some of their organs going so far as to assert that the fall of Nahas Pasha had not been unwelcome to His Majesty’s Government who wished to see a weak Government in office in order to reassume de facto control m spite of the treaty These papers were very violent at the beginning of the year and used every possible argument to discredit Great Britain. Thus the Rome Agreement was stigmatised as a glaring example of Egypt’s continued subservience and the Austrian Anschluss as another manifestation of British perfidy. The reaction of the Balagh to this campaign was feeble, and it took none too strong a line later in the year when the Wafdists launched a series of venomous attacks against the Military Mission, the treaty building programme and the arms and ammuni tion supplied from the United Kingdom. 34. Prom May on (with a short respite during the international crisis of September), Palestine almost dominated the political scene and gave the extreme organs of the Egyptian press every chance to denounce British policy. In this they were aided by the continued and concerted efforts of certain foreign press agencies to exploit the unhappy situation in Palestine and Southern Arabia to our disadvantage. The arrival of the Woodhead Commission was the signal for a general outburst, and to all intents and purposes the issue became one of domestic political importance. The Wafd press claimed that the defence of the Arabs had been one of the main preoccupations of Nahas Pasha, and that this had hastened his fall. To counteract the impression that the Wafd held a monopoly of pro-Arao sympathy, the Government press became no less violent in its condemnation of British policy, and the fact that a fund was opened under Waidist auspices for the victims in Palestine only added fuel to the flames The pace became hotter when almost immediately after Munich, the Arab parlia- anTtUorienkf Jl aS t h£ld f m Tf lr0 ' U® preSS ’ in g eneral &gt; resumed the offensive to keeiUiZl P ? f the embassy were obliged to take special measures manifestation of h A™hntf° f P 80 ' voluminous comment on this spectacular pvati thrAr i Arab nationalism.

During the actual crisis it became abundantly clear that the means open to the Government to restrain the press from abusing its liberty were extremely faulty and a stringent press law was mooted at the end of the year. In the circumstances it became increasingly incumbent on the press section of the embassy to supplement the Government’s deficiencies and contacts with the various organs of public opinion—newspapers, news agencies, films and broadcasting— were extended and improved; a distinct advance was made in the exploitation of advertising as a means of controlling editorial policies. Numerous photographs of weapons of war were distributed and published to illustrate the progress of British rearmament and the annual visit of the fleet to Alexandria was used to point the moral and adorn the tale. A great deal of publicity was also given to the activities of the British Council. 37. The Rome Agreement in April produced an improvement in the tone of the Italian news agency, A.E.O. (the Agence d’Egypte et d’Orient). Nevertheless, it was obvious that the organisation and personnel of Italian propaganda in Egypt remained on a “war footing,” but with a reduced budget, until the ratification of the agreement on the 16th November. It was deduced from the uncanny silence which pervaded practically the whole of the Egyptian press on the occasion of the mass-immigration of Italian families into Libya and the relatively non-committal attitude displayed on the alleged Italian pretensions to Tunis, Corsica and Djibuti that the same sinister influences, so conspicuous in previous years, were still operating, though on the defensive rather than the offensive. A more disquieting aspect of hostile influences was the intensification of activity on the part of Germany. Even if the innumerable reports which reached the Embassy had been completely discounted as tendentious or lacking in tangible evidence, there remained the colossal output of the Deutsches Nach- richten-Buro and the inordinate number of Teutonic tourists and journalists to show that Germany was taking an increased interest in this part of the world which was hardly commensurate with the size of the German community or the extent of their commercial interests. From the day when the Agence d’Egypte et d’Orient became relatively silent, the Deutsches Nachrichten-Buro opened a campaign of anti-British vituperation which varied in intensity with the tune called by the British press and the declarations of leaders of public opinion in the United Kingdom. Previously it would have been correct to say that the Deutsches Nachrichten-Buro press messages had been fairly accurate and objective in their presentation of news relating to British activities and trade. Subsequently, news was presented in such a way as to create false impressions, and especially that, having become the self-appointed protectors of a discredited race, the British were the natural enemies of the Arabs. Herr Paul Schmitz, the representative of the Vdlkischer Beobachter, made repeated journeys to Palestine, where he is reported to have made contacts with subversive elements in collabora tion with Herr Reichert, the manager of the Deutsches Nachrichten-Buro in Jerusalem. Herr Stellbogen, who was responsible for the Deutsches Nachrichten- Biiro bulletins, was assisted by Tewfik Yazgi—a well-known Egyptian journalist, who has long been known to be a German agent. The oriental secretariat of the German Legation was considerably increased, and a sustained effort was made to influence the Egyptian press by bribes and the manipulation of advertising. Another aspect of propaganda which was particularly prominent dui mg the year on e of which there was abundant evidence—was that conducted by the Jews Of this there appeared to be at least three distinct and separate organisa tions • (a) the Zionist news agency, “ Agence d’Orient,” conducted by M. Vilensky ('ex-Cairo correspondent of the Deutsche Allgememe Zeitung) and financed by the Jewish agency; (h) the Jewish Community Council in Egypt, whose mam obiective was to protect their persons and property from anti-Jewish manifesta- Hnnq in Envot• (c) a group of Italian Jews incensed at the treatment of Jews m Italy and Germany,whose tone was pro-Zionist and anti-Fascist. Whilst it might have been supposed that these agencies would have been an asset m combating propaganda from other and definitely hostile sources this was not actually the case P Thus the Agence d’Orient maintained that, however dishonourable the intentions of the British might be as regards Palestine, they were bound hand and foot by the dictates of America. The Jewish Council, at the inception of its campaign inspired articles sympathising with the Arab revolt against British iZerTalism whilst the disgruntled Italian Jews, m their loathing of dictators, dTd their utmost to discredit the Munich Agreement. In course of time, however, the mess section of the embassy succeeded in harnessing Jewish resources to a policy more consistent with British interests. ^ [19464] Cihmbsbhmbbmhbbhhbk ■ * 14 38.

The Oc, that its advertising manager and Alexandria representatives were Jews and thus abk 0 secure a difproportionate quota of Jewish advertising, contributed to the fact that on the subject of Palestine the Dostour was singular y non-committal. The Ahram remained Egypt’s leading newspaper both as regards circulation and foreign news service. It generally maintained its traditional attitude of inde pendence with a tendency to support the Government on all major issues. But occasional articles from its Alexandria correspondent, Abbas Musfi (invariably used for this purpose as not being a member of the editorial stan) indicated cleanly this paper’s opinion that commitments to Great Britain should be restricted to the barest minimum, especially in regard to questions of defence. On the occasion of a visit to Rome during the summer, Gabriel Takla Pasha, the proprietor of the Ahram, was accorded a reception not unworthy of a Cabinet Minister,, and his movements were duly recorded by the Agence d’Egypte et d Orient. The Balagh continued to be the faithful mouthpiece of Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha, and its proprietor, Abdel Kader Hamza was promoted to the rank of Pasha on grounds which could hardly be justified. Its attitude on the subject of Palestine was, at times, far from friendly. The Misri, deprived on the advent to power of Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha of its main source of revenue—Government secret funds—was purchased by the Wafd and became that party’s official organ, under the super vision of Makram Ebeid Pasha. Towards the end of the year, however, one of its editors and ex-co-proprietors, Mahmoud Abul Path (a Wafdist Deputy) became its sole proprietor with the help of funds the source of which could not be definitely ascertained, but which were variously attributed to Ahmed Abboud Pasha and a wealthy American sister-in-law. It continued, under its changed proprietorship,, to proclaim sympathy for the Wafd, but its previous offensive attitude towards Great Britain was perceptibly toned down. The Moqattam remained opposed to British policy and administration in Palestine and published numerous accounts of alleged British “ atrocities.” The Palestine Government oiuere i s exc usion from Palestine and its Jerusalem correspondent was removed UATTU J? mp ' These ,' ll ' as , til: measures did not improve matters.

TheEgyptian Gazette was purchased by Mr. Oswald Finney, the Alexandria cotton magnate, who owns a controlling interest in the Societe Orientate de Publicite, the Bourse Egyptienne and the Egyptian Mail. In spite of assurances made to the embassy that this paper would retain its traditional independence—of recent years slightly impaired by the financial difficulties of its previous owners—it soon became apparent that the anti-Nazi views of the new proprietor and the assistant editor were playing a prominent part in its editorial policy. The Bourse Egyptienne under the editorship of M. Jean Lugol was distinctly anti-authori tarian and made a prominent feature of the Jewish persecution in Germany. In dealing with the Palestine question it appeared to give the impression that the sympathy of the world outside Germany and in Britain in particular was on the side of the Jews. The Re forme and the Patrie began the year with distinct pro- Fascist tendencies-—doubtless subsidised—but they were obliged to change their attitude during the year in deference to their large clientele of Jewish readers. There was no change in the pro-British policy of the Journal d'Egypte whilst the ~Nil passed out of its ephemeral existence owing to financial difficulties and lack of public support. The Giornale d’Oriente could not be regarded as conspicuously anti-British though it continued to publish—even after the ratifica tion of the Pome Agreement—extremely unfriendly messages from its corre spondent in Jerusalem, and was the only European language paper of any importance to make extensive use of the bulletins of the Deutsches Nachrichten- Biiro. Almost all the Greek language papers at one time or another came under the ban of exclusion from Cyprus, the Alexandria newspaper Phos being penalised for having reproduced a telegram from the Ahram containing extracts from an article in the Manchester Guardian unfavourable to the Government administration in Cyprus. Reuters gave no cause for complaint, whilst British official wireless continued to be a valuable asset in providing the Egyptian press with a well-balanced presentation of British news. Of the agencies specialising in news of particular interest to the Near and Middle East, the Agence d J Orient ,'Zionist) was characteristic in creating an atmosphere of disruption amongst the Arabs and solidarity amongst the Jews. The Orient A rabe continued to be largely subservient to the “directive” of the embassy and to publish items of news supplied from official British sources calculated to reflect to the credit of British imperial administration. 89.

In the course of the year, 210 telegrams, each containing an average of between three and four news items and comments from the local press on current events, were despatched by the embassy to the British Broadcasting Corporation. According to the latter’s appreciative comments, they proved a valuable adjunct to the daily news-bulletin. The new transmission received a remarkable degree of publicity in the Egyptian press, the daily programmes and other announce ments being printed regularly in almost every Arabic paper. Extracts from the news bulletin were frequently reproduced both by the local press and the Orient Arabe News Agency. The Arabic transmissions from Rome and Bari continued to give trouble until the ratification of the Rome agreement, though at no time during the year was the tone so blatantly offensive as in the years immediately preceding. The Egyptian State Broadcasting, under the capable technical management of Mr. Ferguson, showed signs of improvement and invari ably deferred to the opinion of the embassy any item in its programme which might have a political flavour. It rendered most valuable assistance to the British Broadcasting Corporation’s Arabic transmission in contributing items to the latter’s musical programme which could not be obtained from other sources.

The fall of Nahas Pasha made it necessary to begin over again with the new Government of Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha. The ambassador at once informed the new Prime Minister of the position, and found no difficulty in securing his complete approval and co-operation both as regards the British reinforcements (consisting chiefly of an anti-aircraft regiment and a light tank battalion) and the measures recommended to be taken by the Egyptian Government. Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha was considerably perturbed at the disparity between the local British and Italian air forces, and was definitely anxious to see the Royal Air Force reinforced in addition to the land forces. Meanwhile, the Chiefs of Staff had approved the “ Combined Plan for the Defence of Egypt ” drawn up by the local British Service commanders, and on the 18th January an abridged version of this plan was sent to the Prime Minister. Two meetings were then held between Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha, the ambassador, the General Officer Commanding-in-chief, the Air Officer Com manding and the naval liaison officer, at which the abridged plan was discussed item by item. The Prime Minister accepted the plan in principle and authorised direct dealings with the Egyptian defence authorities in the matter of its detailed application. This proved no easy task. The latent suspicion of British motives; the Government’s intense fear of being accused by the Wafd (who had now reverted in opposition to an anti-British attitude) of subservience to Great Britain; the lack of proper organisation in the Ministry of War and of properly qualified Egyptian officials; and the virtual absence of Egyptian technical services and equipment to carry out defence works all proved formidable obstacles. The tendency towards inertia was much increased as the scare of invasion from Libya wore off in the spring and early summer and in consequence of the signature of the Rome Agreement in April. These factors were responsible for the continued reluctance of the Egyptian Government to set up joint Anglo-Egyptian committees to tackle the problems of resources in war, or to agree to any regular and effective system of liaison in defence matters. Nevertheless, it was possible by sustained efforts to induce the Egyptian Government to make progress in various directions, and Headquarters, British Troops in Egypt, were successful in securing their co-operation over the organisation of the defences at Alexandria and Mersa Matruh. Egyptian collaboration proved easier and more effective when Hassan Sabry Pasha took over the Ministry of War on the 27th April. The general defence situation steadily improved as the British forces received new equipment and as further reinforcements were sent out from the United Kingdom in response to repeated representations from the ambassador and the local service commanders. The chief amongst these were the despatch of three further squadrons for the Royal Air Force in Egypt and an infantry brigade to Palestine for the immediate reinforcement of Egypt. In preparation for eventual Egyptian collaboration, considerable study was given to the question of the supply of petroleum and other vital requirements by an informal Resources Board composed of representatives of the embassy and the British services. The British authorities also worked out schemes for utilising, to the maximum in war time, the services of the British civilian community in Egypt. 46. The international crisis of September 1938 came at a particularly unfortunate moment, when three British units from the Egyptian garrison were in Palestine and many officers were on leave. When, on the 20th September, it was suggested from London that precautionary measures should be taken, the General Officer Commanding-in-chief sent a mechanised cavalry regiment to Mersa Matruh for reconnaissance purposes, the Egyptian authorities put into force the contemplated anti-sabotage arrangements throughout the country, and, later in the day, began to pay serious attention to air raid precautions. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government had decided that the situation warranted the concentration of the greater part of the Mediterranean Fleet at Alexandiia, and on the 22nd September over thirty of His Majesty’s ships arrived under the command of Admiral Sir Dudley Pound. Following upon a conference between. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, the admiral, the General Officer Commanding- in-chief and a representative of the Air Officer Commanding (at which it emerged that the Italian forces in Libya were being heavily reinforced) the Prime Minister agreed that further precautionary measures should be taken tor the protection of the fleet. These were rapidly carried out, and included the move of the British anti-aircraft regiment and of one Royal Air Force fighter squadron to [19464] Di . 1 ennprvision of the Great Pass entrance war stations around Alexandria, a ene attemp t at obstruction.

Arrangements were also made by His Majesty s Government to send reinforcements from India as soon as possible, and many detailed defence requirements were either put in hand or taken up urgently with the Egyptian Government. These included the provision of additional strategic communica tions and landing grounds in the Western Desert; the creation of petrol and ammunition dumps and the regulation of supplies of petroleum products and of food-stuffs. Preparations were also made for the examination service at Alexandria harbour to be brought into force, for the imposition of censorship, and for the application of the Egyptian law of ‘ ‘ etat de siege ’ ’ on the outbreak of war. General Sir E. Ironside arrived in Egypt on the 29th September to assume duty as General Officer Commanding, Middle East, but on the 4th October instructions were received from His Majesty’s Government to inform the Egyptian Government that in their opinion the emergency had passed. The special emergency measures were then gradually relaxed. Throughout the whole of this period the Egyptian Government gave their fullest co-operation, and the Egyptian civil and military authorities showed an almost embarrassing readiness to look to the British authorities for guidance and help. His Majesty’s Govern ment showed their gratitude in a message from Mr. Chamberlain to Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha, expressing deep appreciation of the Egyptian Government’s spontaneous and unstinted co-operation.

Development of Alexandria Harbour. 48. Among the recommendations for improving the defence of Egypt made to Nahas Pasha at the end of 1937 and renewed to Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha was one for the development of Alexandria harbour to serve as an adequate war-time base for the Mediterranean fleet. The chief improvements required were the dredging of the entrance of the harbour to a depth of 40 feet and the construction of a large dry-dock capable of taking battleships. It was recalled to the Egyptian Ministers that these works had been included in the recommenda tions of experts since 1926 as purely commercial improvements, and it was represented that if they were now put in hand they would serve both for commercial purposes and for the requirements of the fleet in an emergency, without there being any question of the establishment in peace time of a British naval base at Alexandria. This recommendation was repeated in the defence plan submitted to the Egyptian Government, and to it was joined a further recommendation that immediate action should be taken to safeguard the harbour, by enclosing, and ultimately resiting, the greater part of the petroleum storage installations on the harbour front at Alexandria, in view of the risk that they might be set on tire by air bombardment and that the burning oil would then escape into the harbour. The Prime Minister expressed general agreement with these recommendations an undertook to discuss the whole question of the harbour with the Director-Genera of Ports and Lighthouses (Admiral Sir Gerard Wells Pasha) while making it clear that his Government would not wish to accept any financial assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the matter. As a result of this discussion Admiral Wells submitted to Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha at the beginning of February a scheme for effecting the necessary improvements at a roughly estimated cost ot £U million. It was understood that the next move lay with the Prime Minister but nothing further had been heard from him when instructions were received ’from the Foreign Office in April to suggest that the best course woul Kp In adont the existing scheme of improvements drawn up by bn Gym Kirkpatrick- to indicateAat His Majesty’s Government might be able to help in various ways over the execution of this work if entrusted to a British firm, and to urge that an early start should be made on the dred g; n S °ktoldi!heTmTassador The Prime Minister received this reminder favourably and told the amhassaao that the’matterwas prominently in his mind and that he was convinced that a actual work in the autumn. , Q 0n first meeting with the Secretary of State at the Foreign Office in July Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha volunteMed^hat he^wasTea^_^un^e the development works for Alexandria h ^ reasons his off ' er should not be Sir Miles Lampson.

Steps were at once taken by the embassy to clear up the position. Egyptian A rmy and the British Military Mission. . . . 51 Very considerable progress was made in the expansion and training of the Egyptian army, and at the close of the year there were at least indications that some of the most deep-rooted problems were to be tackled m the near future. This was due partly to the fact that the military mission had got properly into its stride and partly to the fact that for the last nine months of the year there was no change of War Minister to break the continuity of effort. Hassan Sabry Pasha showed himself willing to face some of the difficulties that had to be surmounted, although his inability to co-operate smoothly with his Cabinet colleagues tended to slow down administrative action. The Egyptian army was further expanded and at the beginning of 1939 it had been rather more than doubled with com parison with the beginning of 1937. There was also a prospect of a number of units being ready in 1939 to co-operate with the British troops in active operations. The military value of the greater part of the Egyptian army at the end of 1938 was, however, still very low, and its contribution in war could not have gone beyond co-operation with the British troops in static defence. The strength of the army at the end of the year was approximately 1,000 officers and 24,500 men, plus some eighty officers and 1,100 men in the Egyptian Army Air Force. The principal units in the army at the end of the year were :—■ 9 infantry battalions organised in three brigades. 3 machine-gun battalions. 1 light tank regiment. 1 light car cavalry regiment. 2 field artillery regiments. 1 anti-aircraft regiment. No units had progressed beyond a preliminary stage in training and many were incomplete as regards personnel, equipment, or both. The formation of new units was accomplished at the expense of the efficiency of the older established units, since it could only be carried out by drawing on their already scanty reTw solution in 19°38 Ce a nrf and T' 1 ,' . The e y ui P ment Problem was far from t f unate E eIect n s d politica3y apprSy/but also had 'X” standard of maintenance.

The September crisis demonstrated at once the short comings of the Egyptian army, which were to be expected, and a genuine desire to co-operate with the British army. This was gratifying, as showing that, in a real emergency, the Egyptians could be relied upon to the limit of their training and equipment. 53. The most important step forward during the year was the acceptance by the Ministry of War of a five-year plan for the expansion of the army to one mobile and one infantry division, one anti-aircraft division, one reserve division, one coast defence group, and the Sudan contingent. But, although this proposal was accepted, its execution continued to be dependent upon a number of reforms which successive Ministers had lacked the courage to carry through. The chief obstacles encountered by the mission in their efforts to train the Egyptian army lay in the following directions :— (a) The Organisation of the War Ministry .—As constituted it had shown itself incapable of initiating or executing any comprehensive scheme of expansion. This fact was recognised by Hassan Sabry Pasha, and a detailed scheme for the reorganisation of the ministry was under consideration at the end of the year. (b) Recruiting .—A new recruiting law, approved by the Egyptian Govern ment, was drafted without the advice of the military mission. It proved to fall short of remedying all the shortcomings of the existing law. While it reduced the period of colour service for conscripts from five to three years and abolished exemption by purchase, it offered no inducement to non-commissioned officers to remain in the army after their period of conscript service was finished. Nor was any proper provision made for building up the cadre of trained technical personnel (“ tradesmen ”) essential to a modern army. (c) Provision of Officers . —While recognising the necessity for increasing the number of officers in the army and raising their status, the Govern ment did nothing effective to render the army more attractive to the general public as a career. A crisis was produced in December when the Government attempted to apply to the army the conditions obtaining in the civil service. This was an ill-considered move and led to the resignation of Hassan Sabry Pasha early in 1939. (d) Administrative Services .—These were still far behind the fighting services in efficiency, owing to the fact that, until August 1938, the War Ministry refused to accept the services of a British officer to advise them in such matters. (e) Buildings .—The building programme was also considerably beh ind require ments, the chief sufferers being the Royal Egyptian Air Force and the various training establishments. 54. Maior-General J. H. Marshall-Cornwall, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., MH., left ?£VPt on the 23rd October on promotion, and was succeeded by Major-General 5 N. Macready, C.M.G., D.S.O., O.B.E., M.C., as chief of the military mission During the year the mission was expanded to a total of thirty-eight officeis and orty-one warrant officers and non-commissioned officers, including the Royal Air ?orce personnel attached to the Egyptian air force. Nevertheless, it was clear at he end of the year that if real progress were to be made it would he necessary to idd very considerably to the numbers of the mission engaged in the supervision &gt;f training. ’yptian Air Force. . . 55 Training developed satisfactorily under the guidance of the air .section dnirig^iircrafGweie'bought^n'Se United^King^om.°^our squadrons were in lining airc s vear v iz a communications squadron, a Sfetfs «• “ SS&amp;tf-gSi [19464]22 controversy, the Egyptian ^thoriUes agreed^to ^ui^p thwnew^g^ e ^ uipped with the British ‘ Grladmtor.

The Fovntian Government accepted these recommendations in principle and decided at g tL end of the year to make provision for the immediate programme in the 1939-40 budget. They also asked His Majesty’s Government for the services of a captain in the Royal Navy to act as naval adviser, and arrangements were made for Cap“in G T. Philip, D.S.C., R.N., to take up this post on the military Strategic communications. 57. Progress with the treaty roads was slow and revealed the weakness of the system by which the Roads and Bridges Department of the Ministry o Communications arrange for the work by open contract among local contracting firms. The Ismailia-Cairo road was more or less finished up to Bilbeis, but the Ismailia-Alexandria road made slow progress. The contract for the Amria-Fuka road was given to two eontracting firms, but progress left much to be desired, despite frequent representations to the Egyptian authorities by both the embassy and headquarters, British Troops in Egypt, as to the vital military importance of the strategic communications with Mersa Matruh. The link road from the Suez- Cairo road to Geneifa was completed, but the new treaty road between Port Said and Suez remained in suspense. In addition to the treaty roads, the Egyptian Government decided at the time of the September crisis to construct a bitumenised road from El Bahnasa in the Nile Valley to the Oasis of Bahriya, and in October they obtained from the Chamber of Deputies a supplementary credit of £E. 125,000 to begin work. At the end of the year the alignment of the road was still under discussion. In December the question of constructing a strategic road through Sinai to the Palestine frontier was under consideration. 58. The Egyptian Government reverted early in the year to the proposal for a modification on grounds of economy of the alignment of the Ismailia-Alexandria road (see paragraph 89 of the 1937 annual report). This was once more rejected, but, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the Egyptian Government were offered a compromise arrangement whereby, in return for their adhering to the treaty alignment of the Alexandria road and carrying out a long-standino- commercial project for the completion of the Beheira relief line from Saft-el-Enab to Alexandria (with a loop directly on to the Mersa Matruh line), His Majesty’s Government would not insist on the doubling of the Tanta-Zagazig Railway prescubed m the treaty and would allow the existing railway bridge at Zifta fc A i be t ^ rned a ra J [1 an(i roa( l bridge to carry the new Treaty Ismailia- Alexandria road over the eastern branch of the Nile. It was considered bv the ritish military authorities that this deal would have strategic advantages to the tetween CaTroandX 1 ^ a } tel ' n ?, tive an d less vulnerable railway communication railwav to the west of KP Desert ^ h:le ^ding-on the basis that the new to’aShtstentiarsaving^to Ae^E^yptfan^Governme'^ ^ T mercial Pres to this agreement were communfeTtePtoNF h- araft notes to g ive effeot (Hilmi Is g sa Pasha) in J^Th^ of Communications him from pursuing the matter After Hd^Ti ll ^° v 1 ^ 1 fM 11018111 prevented «r-i , k fL.23 w) i]\‘ Minister to agree, and the draft notes were on the point of being signed when Bedawi Pasha returned from Europe and put the whole matter into the melting pot by suggesting changes both of form and substance. 59. The Alexandria-Mersa Matruh Eailway was reconditioned and made available for service. Treaty Building. 60. At the beginning of the year, little progress was made in the construction of the new Suez Canal cantonments. Not only were the Egyptians alarmed at the high prospective cost, but the scale of the building programme appeared to be beyond the capacity of their departmental technical staff. On the 10th May the Egyptian Government presented their estimates of cost to the Treaty Building Committee. The total figure was £E. 11,600,000 for the construction of the cantonments and the necessary ancillaries, excluding outside communications. This high figure came as a shock to the Egyptian Government. The news soon leaked out and gave rise to a campaign in the Arabic press (set going by a manifesto from Ahmed Hussein, the Green Shirt leader) in favour of a radical revision of the treaty arrangements. It was widely suggested that the British troops should stay on temporarily in their existing barracks, and that the money thus liberated should be spent upon the equipment and expansion of the Egyptian forces. The Egyptian Government themselves did not hold such radical views, but the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance (then Ismail Sidky Pasha) had, earlier in the year, made tentative soundings in private discussion with the ambassador about the possibility of returning to the original proposal 19 36 whereby His Majesty’s Government would be responsible for building and the Egyptian Government would pay a fixed contribution of £E. 5 million. Sir Miles Lampson had not encouraged these soundings and had pointed out the many difficulties and objections involved in amending the treaty arrangements. The Prime Minister, nevertheless, made it clear that he intended to revert to the ques tion during his visit to London in July. Meanwhile, in view of the Egyptian agita tion for treaty revision, it was deemed advisable to make a general review of the position. The conclusions reached at a discussion in May between the ambassador, &gt; the General Officer Commanding-in-chief and the Air Officer Commanding were that it was desirable that the move of the British forces to the Canal Zone should not be abandoned, but that if the Egyptians were actually to press for the retention of the British forces in Cairo and' Alexandria the idea should not be rejected finally until the military position had been examined by the authorities m London. As regards the detailed arrangements for the construction of the new cantonments, it was recommended that while there should be no British initiative m proposing revision there was much to be said for reverting to the original proposal whereby His Majesty’s Government would themselves be responsible for building m return for an Egyptian lump-sum contribution. [19464]» 24 arrangement would be considerably ^ faf m wYth MoLmed PafhaYtpo^rTwY^ 6 Egyptian GoTrnmenf werYnot the Secretary of State that His Majesty’s Government accepted his prop 0 ^ 1 m principle, provided that a satisfactory settlement were reached with regard to improvements to Alexandria harbour and on the question of the Egyptian taritt on imported cotton piece-goods. Detailed negotiations were then rapidly can through in London and a draft protocol and an agreed minute were initialled on the 4th August by Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha and Lord Halifax The protocol provided that the Egyptian Government would still be responsible for making available the necessary lands in the Canal Zone and for constructing the accommo dation, amenities, essential services, &amp;c., but that in view of the Egyptian representations that the cost of the new accommodation had been discovered to be greater than that contemplated at the time of the signing of the treaty His Majesty’s Government would contribute (in addition to the sums spent by the Egyptian Government before 1914 on the construction of new barracks) “ one- half of the cost of the construction of the accommodation for the land and air forces, and the water and electric supplies, amenities and convalescent camp, and the dwellings of the civilian personnel of the British forces,” subject to certain items such as communications, railway works, administrative, sanitary and public utility services in the zone remaining the sole liability of the Egyptian Govern ment. The arrangements for the actual payment of the British contribution remained unchanged, i.e., the British half-share of the cost of accommodation would be paid on the final evacuation of the British forces from Alexandria. The agreed minute made it clear that the fact that the protocol had been drawn up in view of the Egyptian estimates of the 10th May, 1938, and of the accommoda tion, amenities, &amp;c., which those estimates covered, did not preclude His Majesty’s Government from submitting revised requirements for the Royal Air Force. An oral understanding was also reached that the Egyptian Government would ask for the assistance of a number of British technical experts in carrying out the works. The protocol was signed at Alexandria on the 22nd September by the Prime Minister and Mr. Bateman as charge d’affaires. An attempt to secure by an exchange of private letters a recognition by the Egyptian Government of the right of His Majesty’s Government to obtain some compensation for their share of the cost of the cantonments if and when the British forces finally left Egypt met with considerable opposition on the Egyptian side and was abandoned so as not to embarrass the Prime Minister during the international emergency. The revised arrangements m the protocol were naturally welcomed by most Egyptians as a pm5y plltygrouids 11 ^ Egyptian finances &gt; but were attacked by°the Wafd on 62.

Other matters which were put in hand by the Egyptian Government during the year included the construction of a fresh water canal to the site of the Royal Air Force station at Kabrit, the filling-in of areas of swamp land on the banks of the Lake, the levelling of other parts of the site, and the expropriation of privately-owned lands. At the end of the year there were signs that the interest of the Egyptian Government in treaty building was waning as the European situation continued to deteriorate and expenditure on the development of the Egyptian armed forces and other urgent defence requirements continued to mount. Passive Defence of the British Civil Community. 63. The threat of war in the autumn made the British civil community in Egypt keenly aware of the danger of their situation. In the event of Italy remaining faithful to the Axis, she would early have been tempted to ^ try conclusions in Egypt. The centres of population—Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said and Suez—lay open to air bombardment from many directions and it was more than probable that Italy would have endeavoured to create panic and confusion behind the British lines. Stocks of drugs and medicaments were low, and it was anticipated that overseas sources of supply would be cut off in the early stages of war. Although 38,000 gas masks had been ordered from the United Kingdom at the beginning of the year for the use of British civilians, they had not arrived in September, and there was no general organisation of the community to meet the emergencies which might well arise. A beginning had been made by His Majesty’s Consuls in August to earmark British civilians for special duties in case of necessity, and in Cairo and Alexandria courses of instruction in nursing and the care of wounded were initiated. In October, however, it was clear that there was a general desire for those various activities to be co-ordinated. In Alexandria the process was well on the way by November owing to the energy and initiative of His Majesty’s Consul-General, Mr. Heathcote-Smith. In Cairo His Majesty’s Ambassador nominated a Central Committee representing all sections of the British community and the armed forces, and by the end of the year the organisation of the passive defence of British civilians in both cities had taken practical shape. Large sums of money were raised or guaranteed for the purchase of medical stores, drugs and surgical equipment from the United Kingdom; special (man-power) registers of British subjects (including Maltese, Cypriots and Indians) were opened; the courses and lectures on air-raid precau tions, first aid and nursing were extended and were well attended; and plans were actively studied for the increase in existing hospital accommodation and for the protection of the community in times of civil commotion. The gas masks ordered in the United Kingdom early in the year arrived in November. Civil Aviation. 64. The development of civil aviation in Egypt remained intricate and baffling. From considerations of defence His Majesty’s Government endeavoured to forestall undesirable foreign aviation activities. To this end the Egyptian Government were constantly reminded of the dangers of foreign infiltration and were urged to place the control of civil aviation under the military authorities. At the same time schemes were evolved for the expansion of Egyptian civil aviation with British assistance. The results achieved were satisfactory, inasmuch as no new undesirable foreign air services were established; but on the other hand there was nothing to show in the way of positive reorganisation in Egyptian civil aviation. 65. At various times the Egyptian Government were pressed by the German- Polish and Greek Governments to permit the establishment of services terminating in Egypt. The Italian Government desired to conclude an air convention with the Egyptian Government to replace their existing icvocable authorisation for the transit services of Ala Littoria, and the Hutch Government desired to establish services terminating in Cairo in addition to then K.L.M. transit services. Late in the year the French asked for leave to establish a service crossing Egypt from Libya to Palestine and Syria, and American interests contemplated the possibility of extending a proposed transatlantic nying-boat service to Egypt. Not all these services were undesirable in themselves, but to admit any one of them would have made it difficult to exclude the rest. It was particularly necessary to avoid German and Italian terminal services. The26 Egyptian Government therefore 0 inadequate for any extra ground organisation at Egyptian aerodromes v appllca ^ services. Meanwhile eflorts were made^to fiU^he gaP services on a more se eure tions by putting the existing Egyp n sible for the air services within foundation. Misr Airwork, (with extension to Cyprus Egypt and also runs a service to Bagdad a 1 Egyptian Government in the summer) was continually and partly owing partly to the latter s hesitation in b a y b ^ reduced No expansion to efforts made by various parties to have ^ ^ could therefore be looked for from this sour‘d Mor ovo wag ^EOTTaJd'lute^lrnUy o““ffi 5 foreign services at present operated bv Misr Airwork. The latter would then be left as a completely tgyp coniDanv running internal Egyptian services. His Majesty’s Government adopted Z idea in principle at the end of January. But it was clear hat Imperial Airways were doubtful as to how far they could commit themselves and ow much they could count on the backing of His Majesty s Government. Emit was considerable correspondence between the Embassy and the Foreign O regarding the procedure to be followed in presenting the idea to the Egyptian Government and to Misr Airwork, great care being necessary in order to avoid giving the company the impression that they were being absorbed m Imperial Airways. Finally, on the 15th June instructions were received from the Foieign Office to inform the Egyptian Government that Imperial Airways were prepared to propose to Misr Airwork the formation of a joint company for an England- Egypt service, and to enquire whether this proposal would enjoy the Egyptian Government’s support. The new company would be registered in Egypt and its aircraft would fly under the Egyptian flag. The proportion of capital to be contributed by Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork would be decided in later 66. The Prime Minister was very favourably disposed to the idea, but was anxious that any proposal of the kind should appear to be on the initiative of the Egyptian Government. Procedure was discussed at length with Amin Osman Pasha, but there was no time to reach any definite conclusion before the Prime Minister left for Europe. In September, negotiations between the embassy and the Egyptian Government were resumed, and it was decided, at the suggestion of Amin Osman Pasha acting on behalf of the Prime Minister, that Imperial Airways should be invited to send a representative to Cairo to work out a concrete scheme. Accordingly, Sir F. Joseph—one of the British Government’s directors on the board of Imperial Airways—accompanied by Mr. Dismore of Imperial Airways arrived early in November and after a two days’ discussion, at which the embassy was represented by Mr. Bateman, a draft heads of a°Tee- ment was initialled by Sir F. Joseph^ and Amin Osman Pasha on the &amp; 3rd November. The tenor was as follows :— -pi 7. r— j — — vviwi an isMieu uapibai oi iiUU.UUU, tUe Egyptian Government to subscribe 51 per cent, and Imperial Airways 40 per cent.; the board of the company to consist of seven directors, three Egyptians appointed by the Egyptian Government, three British subiects appointed by Imperial Airways and one Egyptian to be appointed bv agree ment- the Egyptian share of the total subsidy to be 25 per cent, but not to exceed £20,000 in any one year; the company to operate such other overseas the matter had been badly submitted to the Kin' IN k Ct, ° n ^ He said ^ that he hoped to be able to reverse the K nl’^i 6 MmiS *? T r of Finance . b ut successful at the end of the year 8 S deC1S10n ’ He had ™t been•27 National Flying Corporation. 67. Apart from the danger of foreign influence in Egyptian civil aviation through the establishment of foreign air services terminating in Egypt, there have been symptoms of foreign influence asserting itself through the German sympathies of various Egyptian aviation personalities, notably Mohamed Taher Pasha, the Vice-President of Misr Airwork, Count Almazy, who is closely associated with him in running a school for gliding, and, most clearly, Nabil Abbas Halim. Abbas Halim has organised during the year, with the help of Hassan Anis Pasha, a body known as “ The National Flying Corporation,” which is intended to do propaganda for aviation in Egypt and particularly to offer advanced flying training. Abbas Halim has a certain influence, particularly at the Palace, and his organisation met with some success. He obtained a subsidy of £E. 4,000 from the Ministry of Communications and with this money purchased two Czecho-Slovak and one German aircraft for training. He also ordered a British aircraft, but has not yet obtained delivery. One of his avowed objects is to break the monopoly position of Misr Airwork, particularly as regards flying training. By the terms of the Misr authorisation they are given the exclusive right to train pilots on Government aerodromes. The National Flying Training Corporation have therefore been examining the possibility of making new aerodromes of their own, but they are still handicapped in this and other developments by lack of funds. Abbas Halim took a large part in the reception of various visiting German aircraft, and it is feared that he will try to build up his organisation with the help of German aircraft and German experts. Civil Aviation Department. 68. The organisation of the Civil Aviation Department of the Ministry of Communications has some importance both from the defence aspect (since the presence of a British official there allows early information of a foreign applica tion to be received), and from the point of view of the safety of flying and the Empire Airmail services. At the beginning of 1938 the post of Director-General of Civil Aviation was held by a British official, Group-Captain R. J. Bone. His position in the Ministry had for some time been undermined by intrigue in the Ministry, with the result that, while he could take useful steps in informing the embassy of foreign moves and in holding up and refusing undesirable foreign applications for air services, his positive recommendations were seldom carried out in full. The unsatisfactory nature of Group-Captain Bone’s position was taken up on several occasions with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Communications, but these representations had little effect and othei means had to be devised for improving the organisation of the Civil Aviation Department and increasing the British participation in it. 69. The two most hopeful suggestions which emerged from much discussion were that Civil Aviation should 'be transferred to the Ministry of War and Marine, and that the posts of Director-General, Civil Aviation, and of Chie Technical Inspector in the Civil Aviation Department (held by Mr. A. W. Savage) should, on the retirement of Group-Captain Bone, become advisory rathei than executive. It was contemplated that, if the transfer of Civil Aviation to the Ministry of Defence could be arranged, Group-Captain Tait of the Mi i aiy Mission, would be able to keep a watchful eye on both military an civi aviation. There was every reason to suppose that following upon Group-Gap tain Bone’s retirement the Egyptian side of Civil Aviation (and notably Roushdy Bey) would become more amenable, and would be obliged to rely on the advice of Mr. Savage. Group-Captain Bone left the Egyptian Government service on the 26th December, and Roushdy Bey was appointed Acting Director-General, Civil Aviation. By this time the Air Ministry had agreed to allow Mr. Savage to remain a further year in Egypt, and the prospect of the transfer of Civil Aviation to the Ministry of Defence was bright as the year dosed The unfortunate clash of personalities m the Civil Aviation Department had hmdeie the much needed improvement of aerodromes, the provision of ^ ir ^ adl ^ s f r ^ lc ^ and the proper organisation of meteorological observation, and the anxiety of the embassy to effect a speedy improvement was due to then- interest not only in the air defences of Egypt, but also m the provision of all possible facilities for the Empire Airmail Scheme. The Air Ministry lent the serv 1C es of Mr. Lumsden for the training of Egyptian officers m aerodrome control.Empire Air Matt Scheme. , h with obiect of obtaining 70.

The main Empire Air Mail J^ran^fments for the Alexandria marine airport; facilities desired were (ffl) better arrangeme ^ landplane service ^ fr ° m EUgland ’ ^ and the north coast of Egypt. 71 As regards (a) it had been recognised for some time that the site „ hLe ht Imperial Airways at Ras-el-Tin in Alexandria harbour was unsuitable largely owing to its restricted size and to the fact that it was held on a lease proviling for only three months’ notice from the Khedmal Mail Line Accordingly, after the visit of an Air Ministry expert, a note was addressed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in October asking that occupation of the site might be guaranteed to Imperial Airways for at least live years, and that in accordance with the practice of other countries participating m the scheme, the lease of the site might be paid for by the Egyptian Government and certain other facilities (wireless, slipway and control launches) might be nmvirlpfl hv them. No reolv had been received by the end of the year. 72. Question (6) above became urgent owing to the prohibition to civil aircraft of the landing ground at Mersa Matruh. This left no good aerodrome available between Benghazi and Alexandria. After some discussion of rival alternative sites, it was decided to press the Egyptian Government to extend the Solium aerodrome. This had previously been under the control of the Royal Air Force but was handed over to the Egyptian Civil Aviation Department, who agreed to carry out the necessary work. As this was not finished by the end of the year, the Egyptian Government agreed, as an exceptional measure, to let Imperial Airways use Mersa Matruh for mail-carrying land-aircraft only during the rush period of Christmas mails. In view of the increasing use of Dekheila aerodrome at Alexandria by military aircraft, the Egyptian Govern ment were further urged to find an alternative site for a civil aerodrome near Alexandria, and, meanwhile, to give Imperial Airways more hangar accommo dation at Dekheila. No alternative site had been selected by the end of the year, but the hangar position became more satisfactory. The regular landplane service had not been started by the end of the year.

At the end of the year, however, the Government made proposals which were unacceptable to the directors of the National Bank, and the Governor was considering whether to bring matters to a head by suggesting liquidation to his shareholders on the ground that this was in their best interests unless the Govern ment would agree to mutually satisfactory terms. Hydro-Electric Project at Assouan. 76. No definite progress was made in 1938 in the long-drawn-out negotia tions between the United Kingdom group formed of the English Electric Company (Limited), Imperial Chemical Industries (Limited) and Lazard Brothers on the one hand, and the Egyptian Government on the other, for the construction of a hydro-electric power station and a fertiliser factory at Assouan. The Government reiterated during the budget debate and in the Speech from the Throne on the 19th November their intention to proceed with the project and, in reply to an interpellation in the Chamber of Deputies in June, the Minister of Public Works said that the Assouan Dam scheme was foremost in the Government’s works programme and that they were resolved to carry it out. Representatives of the group visited Egypt in March 1938. Egyptian Police. 77. During the year the British element in the Egyptian police force was decreased by 10 officers and 42 constables. Of this number 4 officers and 11 constables retired voluntarily and, in accordance with His Majesty’s Govern ment’s agreement with the Egyptian Government, their vacancies in the yearly quota lists were filled by extending the periods of service of European officers and constables who were due to be retired at an earlier date. His Majesty’s Govern ment and the non-official organisations in England and in Egypt continued to give every assistance to retiring officers and constables in their search for fresh employ ment. As regards the British members of the Egyptian police force who retired in 1937 and 1938, the position as at the 31st December was as follows :— 1937. 1938. Obtained employment Left Egypt (without cer tainty of other employ ment) On pension and/or considered unemployable Deceased Still in Egypt and unem ployed ... Officers. Constables. Officers. 6 68 8 1 2 1 3 6 1 1 5 1 Constables. 34 2 1 5 78. The above-quoted figures for 1938 include one officer and five constables of the Palace police, who, not being members of the Egyptian City Police under the Ministry of the Interior, were not originally included in the elimination schemes prepared after the ratification of the Anglo-Lgyptian Treaty. These officials, who were employed on contracts and paid from Palace funds, were given to understand by the Palace authorities that their services were likely to be retained for some years. Early this year, however, they were informed that their contracts, which terminated on the 31st May, would not be renewed. I he question of their treatment on retirement was therefore taken up by His Majesty s Embassy with the Palace authorities, and arrangements were made for them to receive financial treatment similiar to that accorded to their colleagues m the city police. 79 As a result of the policy (recorded in paragraph 104 of the annual report 1937) of allowing all British members of the Egyptian police force to apply vacancies of which His Majesty’s Embassy might have knowledge, an30 fillins of vacancies important question of principle ^XomalTy be held by British officers in the higher posts of the police, which woum no ^ Comma ndants m Cairo until 1941 Viz., those of Commandants with the commandants of Alexandria, Port Said and Suez^ After t h at there were three police, the ambassador su|gested to h j of office rs for the posts of possible courses of action m regata ro commandant: • H • (a) To agree unconditionally to Egyptian ®*^^ k ^ s g aI1( i w hen vacancies U T ”«“ “as.tr? o«te „ appointed .» a. advisory capacity; or (c) To bring in officers (i) From the Egyptian Frontiers Administration. (ii) From other police forces. In the ambassador’s opinion the first alternative was olwiously ™^ e g ritish if only for the reason that its adoption might inyffive a stamp dou btful police The third alternative presented great difficu ties, whether officers from the Egyptian Frontiers Administration would be ava 1 W while officers seconded from other police forces would be so ^[X^frlsons the conditions that they could hardly exercise effective control. y° , Xosl expedient ambassador considered that the second alternative seemed to be ^ “ m the and, if adopted, might even result, should His Majesty s Crovernment in United Kingdom so desire, in the retention of British pohce officers aftei the five-year period. It was realised, however, that such a policy could only be adopted if His Maiesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were prepared to agiee o a departure from the strict letter of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. The decision of the Foreign Office was that the first alternative should not be agreed to unconditionally, but might, in certain circumstances, be reasonable, while the second would be satisfactory provided that a suitable British officer were available to act as adviser, and provided the Egyptian Government agreed. As, however, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are entitled under the Anglo- Egyptian Treaty to retain British officers in command during the five-year period, the Egyptians would have little cause for complaint. As regards the third alternative, it was considered doubtful whether this would be practicable even in the unlikely event of the Egyptian Government being prepared to accept it. With regard to the posts of assistant commandant, the Foreign Office approved the ambassador’s recommendation that an endeavour should be made to keep these appointments in British hands so long as British officers continue to fill the posts of commandant. During the year one of the assistant commandants retired voluntarily and his post was filled by another British officer. There have been no changes in the commandants. A scheme whereby certain European police officers and men who are expert political and criminaf detectives or specialists in the work of the fire brigades should be retained in the Egyptian police force after 1941 was proposed to the Minister of the Interior, Cairo' by Sir Thomas Russell Pasha and is still under consideration by the Egyptian authorities. In principle Russell Pasha’s proposal has much to recommend it, and as the Prime Minister seems favourably disposed towards it, it is possible that the obstacles in the way of its acceptance may not be found insuperable. J 80. During the crisis in September arrangements were made with the Egyptian Government, at the request of the Suez Canal Company for a number of police guards to be available for duty in the Canal Zone in connexion with the control of suspect ships. The oriental secretariat of His Maiestv’s Embassv has maintained close touch with the Egyptian Public ^onviur fwU ? ^ mt,ass y Police on matters pertaining to local intSence LrtX5l and internal public, security, there has also be^’iSanTEf tef' “l 1 ' 8 concerning Italian, German and other subversive activiHeP T? U f atl ? nBritish Education and Culture. 81. Lord Lloyd paid a further visit to Egypt early in March 1938 accompanied by Colonel Bridge, secretary-general of the British Council. As a result, grants totalling over £22,000 were authorised for the financial year 1938-39, as compared with the £16,400 spent in the previous year. A large part of this increase was devoted to scholarships and busaries enabling Egyptian students to visit the United Kingdom. Five graduates of the Egyptian University proceeded for courses of one year, with £350 each, and a party consisting of five University students and one school teacher, each receiving £100, visited' Oxford for the summer vacation course in August. Amongst the recommendations submitted to Lord Lloyd by the embassy for the current year was a proposal for the establishment of evening classes in the English language and in Matriculation subjects both in Cairo and Alexandria. The British Council decided to appoint its own representative in Egypt, to organise the evening classes and to exercise a general supervision over all the Council’s activities in the Near East. Mr. C. A. F. Dundas was eventually appointed to this post. It was agreed that he would in due course take over from the embassy the major part of the Council’s work in Egypt. He was instructed to keep in the closest touch with the embassy, and obtain the ambassador’s approval for any proposals involving general policy which he might submit to the British Council. It was also agreed that Mr. Dundas would not be entitled to regard himself as having any rights of inspection or supervision over the various self-governing institutions which the Council subsidises in Egypt. Mr. Dundas arrived in Egypt in September, and immediately set to work to organise the Evening Institutes in Cairo and Alexandria. He appointed Mr. Highwood, an assistant master at Victoria College, and Mr. Scovil, second master of Victoria College, to supervise the classes in Alexandria. The institutes were advertised at the beginning of November, and by the 1st December, when the Cairo Institute was opened, over 800 applications had been received. The opening of the Alexandria Institute was delayed owing to the illness of Mr. Scovil, but it was clear that in Alexandria, as in Cairo, there was an enormous demand for the facilities offered. On the 12th March, 1938, Lord Lloyd laid the foundation stone of the new buildings of the English school, which were then half completed, and the school moved into them during the last days of the year. There was a net deficit of £700 on the running of the school at the end of the school year. This was met out of standing funds, and no extra subsidy was asked for. The school council hope that the advantages of the new premises, together with a careful policy of retrenchment, will prevent any deficit in the coming year. 82. There was a steady growth throughout the year of the activities of the Anglo-Egyptian Union. Meetings and lectures were well attended, and members made increasing use of the union for social purposes. Early in the year the embassy proposed to the Council of the Union that a review should be made of the possible extension of the cultural side of the union s work. As a result of this it was eventually agreed that the British Council should make a grant of £1,000 a year, on the understanding that the Egyptian Government would make a similar payment, to cover the salary and expenses of a cultural director. This appointment had not been made by the end of the year, but enquiries were being made in England for a suitable candidate. Arrangements were also made lor the formation of a branch of the union in Alexandria. Subsidies were nsked for from the British Council and the Egyptian Government, and the parent body in Cairo has promised a grant of £500. It is understood that there is also a movement to start a branch in Port Said. A bolition of the Quarantine Board. 83 When the year opened, Dr. Morgan, of the Ministry of Health, was still in Cairo endeavouring to obtain the concurrence of the Egyptian authorities m the draft heads of agreement between His Majesty s Government and the Egyptian Government (see paragraph 138 of the Egypt Annual Report,193/). In the lengthy conversations which ensued, the Egyptian case was coiimietec almost entirely by Bedawi Pasha and it soon became clear that un er his influence the'Egyptian Government were ignoring the practical issues involved An exaggerated sensitiveness about theoretical questions of sovereignty led them to dispute all the points previously accepted by the including not merely those relating to the system to be substituted foi the32 Quarantine Board, but all the P™P 0S f s Egyptian V Government di ^ f f„ Government as allies app^red to expect His Many’s Govm foHno- to maintain an emcient quaianti as: s.

They consented to negotiate the terms of such modifications with such of those Powers as were practically interested, and it was decided that among such must be included not only the Powers represented on the Quarantine Board but also the United States, Japan, Saudi Arabia and India, who should all be invited to participate in the negotia tions. The Egyptian Government refused, however, to include Iraq and Iran. It was also agreed, after some demur, that the International Health Office in Paris should be employed as the place of meeting and provide the Secretariat for the discussions; and that the French Government should be asked to issue the invitations and to notify at the same time all the other co-signatories of the 1926 Convention so that they could send representatives if they so desired. His Majesty’s Government warned the French Government beforehand that they would be likely to receive a request of this sort from the Egyptian Government, and Dr. Morgan gave the French authorities an outline of the situation with a view to en ist their support in preventing opposition from other Powers which might lead the Egyptian Government to denounce the Sanitary Convention altogether. The French Government were not, however, informed of the heads y a J es ‘y’5, GOTernm ent and the Egyptian Government.

Thus they were all aware of the unity of opinion between the two Governments principally concerned and of the safeguards which the Egyptian Government had agreed to concede. They presumably considered it useless and unwise to make objections or further claims in face of this unity. Nevertheless the theory of a common front of Great Britain and Egypt was exploded by the conference, and this is likely to have an adverse effect on our efforts to obtain concessions from the Egyptian Government in other matters involving international consent. The actual text of the protocol of the 31st October, 1938, had not been received at the end of the year. “ Caisse de la Dette.” 87. At the beginning of the year the position was that Makram Pasha on behalf of the Egyptian Government had agreed with His Majesty’s Government in London in September 1937 that, in consideration of the consent of His Majesty’s Government to abolish the Caisse, the reserve fund should be main tained and the land tax assigned to secure the service of the debt; payment was to be made directly into a special account at the National Bank. The outstanding point on which he was not in agreement was the further requirement of His Majesty’s Government that the revenue from the land tax should be paid into the account “as collected.” The draft convention which the embassy had submitted to the Foreign Office, and the law which would embody the new arrangements were amended to meet the views of the Treasury and the Council of Foreign Bondholders. 88. In July the matter was first raised with the ambassador by the Egyptian Government in the course of an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who asked that discussions should be initiated with a view to a settle ment of the question of the abolition of the Caisse and appeared to recognise that the payment ‘ ‘ as collected ’ ’ was the only outstanding point. The presence in London of the Prime Minister, Bedawi Pasha and Amin Osman Pasha in connexion with the revision of article 8 of the treaty was accordingly seized upon for the purpose of initiating discussions on the question of the Caisse. Meetings were held on the 30th July and 4th August at the Treasury which were attended by representatives of the French and Italian Ministries of Finance, as well as Bedawi Pasha and Amin Osman Pasha. At these meetings the drafts referred to above were discussed, but Bedawi Pasha flatly refused to accept any assign ment of revenue. He produced counter-drafts containing the proposals made by Sidky Pasha as Minister of Finance, which substituted for assignment of revenue the maintenance of a liquid sum of £E. 1,100,000 in a special account at the bank. No progress was made in bringing the two points of view nearer together and it was decided to adjourn the discussions until October, when Bedawi Pasha would have had an opportunity for further consideration of the draft proposals of the Caisse Powers. The Egyptian representatives at these meetings disclaimed the view that their Government was in any way bound by the heads of the agree ment initialled by Makram Pasha in 1937. Early in October negotiations were resumed in Paris. Bedawi Pasha, again represented the Egyptian Government. He immediately made it clear that he had no intention of discussing the British draft. He insisted on defending his own in spite of being informed that its basis was quite unacceptable to His Majesty’s Government in the face of the 1937 agreement. Representations were made on behalf of the ambassador to the Egyptian Prime Minister on the ground that Bedawi Pasha’s proposals paid no regard to the 1937 agreement. As a consequence the Prime Minister instructed Bedawi Pasha to carry on the discussions on the basis of that document, but maintained (and so instructed Bedawi Pasha) that the. Egyptian Government could not accept any assignment of the land tax or the maintenance of the reserve fund. The document was merely to be the basis of discussions and not the basis of agreement. 89. With these instructions guiding the Egyptian delegates, it is not surprising that the negotiations in Paris did not make any headway. Four meetings were held, but Bedawi Pasha remained adamant in refusing to consider the British proposals on their merits and on defending a new draft of his own which amounted to no more than the abolition of the Caisse with no compensatory34 guarantee for the bondholders other than ™“/the S date. By the first debts into a special account three threatening to leave Paris and the days of November Bedawi Pasha J&gt; hich was glven to negotiations would which was put forward events by the Council of Minister h U ld ° indertake to ma ke the service of the to them by the embassy that Egyp ^ countryj instead of assigning any debts a first charge on all the reve /nsfracted to make this as the Egyptian —a annuaTdue upon Kebts'and the maintenance of the reserve fund. Bedawi p as ha refused to countenance this latter proviso and would not engage his Government to any payment into the special account, except one week m advance of the due dates of the payments. The negotiations were thereupon abandoned and Bedawi Pasha returned to Egypt. 90. The Egyptian Government argued that His Majesty’s Government alone were responsible for the failure to reach a settlement in Paris owing to their uncompromising attitude, and they persistently asserted that the Italian and French Governments had been willing to accept the Egyptian Government s offer of the first charge without any other conditions and without maintenance of the reserve fund. Although it is not altogether clear from the proces-verbaiuc of the Paris meetings that this claim of the Egyptian Government could be substan tiated, as far as the French representatives were concerned, there is no doubt that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha, did, before he left Paris early in November, gain the impression that the French Government did not intend to make difficulties about the abolition of the Caisse. Stiffened by what they regarded as the complacent attitude of the French Government, the Egyptian Government maintained their point of view and began to hint at unilateral action. To meet this situation the ambassador was authorised early in December to inform the Egyptian Government that His Majesty’s Government would not insist on monthly payments into the special account, provided the Egyptian Govern- ment undertook to pay the necessary sum to meet the periodical payments one month m advance of the due date. Even this further concession, however did not satisfy the Egyptian Government. They remained immovable on the question of the reserve fund. There were further indications that the French Government rnTppLen/deldlock 0 ^ firSt unconditionaI1 y. ** ended Chapter IV.— Relations between Egypt and the Sudan.

These proposals were made solely with a view to greater administrative efficiency as representing a truer ethnographical division than the present borbers by including in the Sudan the whole of the Nuer and Anuak tribes—which at present live partly in the Sudan and partly in Italian East Africa and cross the boundary for seasonal grazing—and by attributing to Italy an area used for grazing by tribes normally resident in Italian territory. It was realised that the suggested adjustment with Kenya might cause difficulty with the Egyptian Government as it appeared to involve a cession of territory by the Sudan to a British colony. It was, however, intended to do no more than carry out an order issued by the Colonial Office in 1914 fixing the boundaries of Uganda, part of which has since become Kenya. This order laid down that the Turkana tribe should be included in Uganda, but the boundaries were never satisfactorily determined until a joint Sudan-Kenya commission investigated the area in 1938. It was proposed that after the preliminary negotiations had been carried out in Rome the actual definition of the new frontiers should be carried out by a joint commission of Italian and Sudan officials. 93. In December the Egyptian Government requested to be supplied with particulars of the areas and populations to be exchanged to enable them to arrive at a decision. The required information was supplied by the Sudan Government before the end of the year. Trade between Egypt and the Sudan. 94. The value of imports into Egypt from the Sudan during the first nine months of 1938 amounted to £E. 635,843 compared with £E. 633,835 during the corresponding period of 1937. The principal Sudanese exports to Egypt which increased in value were beans, millet, ground nuts and gum arabic, whilst the main decreases were in chickpeas, sesame, dyeing and tanning materials, hides and skins. Exports from Egypt to the Sudan during the same periods totalled £E. 830,525 compared with £E. 735,401, representing an increase of £E. 95,124 during the first nine months of 1938. The principal items in which Egypt increased her trade with the Sudan were cane sugar, silk rayon goods and arms and ammunition; whilst decreases were registered in respect of wheat flour, confectionery, soap, and cast iron and steel. The total trade figures for the first nine months of 1937 and 1938 are shown in the subjoined table :— Jan.-Sept. 1937. Jan.-Sept. 1938. £E. £E. Egyptian exports to the Sudan ..

Early in January the Prime Minister explained to the Sudan agent that he wished to effect an immediate reduction in the subsidy paid by Egypt to the Sudan, and that he was anxious, in addition, to come to an agreement whereby the subsidy would be totally cancelled. In subsequent conversation with His Majesty’s Ambassador the Prime Minister made it clear that he had no wish to embarrass the Sudan Government, and that his demarche was made for internal political reasons and mainly to combat Wafd propaganda. He was told that it36 would be necessary for the Governor-General to consult Hts ) J m) ment, since the Makram-Fass Agreement (see 19 f ti P an Government. In was one between His Majesty's f''^p^rOffice, informed the February the ambassadoi, on mstruc apypre fall in cotton prices, which Prime Minister in writing that, m ° f , be veTy difficult for His affected the budgetary position of ' not j ce 0 f an y reduction of the Majesty’s Government to warve their ^ f aw “oHce^f however; that if'th™Egyptian Government^felt 1 bouniflo pfess for an immediate reduction of £250 000 His Maiesty’s Government would be prepaieo to agi_ wi ou prejudme to therr iig^ts. The Pnme bSHn the confirmed that provision for the payment of £50 0 ,000 would be made i current budget. He gave notice at the same time that the subsidy ^ould be totally withdrawn as from the next financial year, and informed the Governor- General in the same sense. On the 14th April the ambassador, on instructions from the Foreign Office and in agreement with the Sudan Government, informed the Prime Minister that one year’s notice appeared to be insufficient, having regard to the expressed desire of the Sudan Government not to hamper the administration and development of the Sudan. Parliament having leluctantly approved, in July, the payment of a subsidy of £500,000 for the financial year 1938-39, the position of'future payments was discussed between the Prime Minister, the Minister of Public Works and the Governor-General in London in August. As a result the Prime Minister agreed to make one further payment of £250,000 in the next financial year, but insisted that this should be the last. An agreement on these lines was confirmed in letters exchanged between the Prime Minister, the ambassador and the Governor-General. Sudan Debt to Egypt. 96. The Makram-Fass Agreement (see 1936 annual report, paragraph 100) established the principle that the only amounts advanced by Egypt to the Sudan which should be included in the Sudan’s indebtedness to Egypt were those which had been advanced for development (i.e., exclusive of various other payments made by Egypt for military expenditure or to meet deficits in the Sudan budget). The exact amount involved was uncertain, and it was agreed that the figures should be examined by the Egyptian and British Treasuries. Durino- the visit of Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha to London in the summer, the Financial Secretary of the Sudan Government and His Majesty’s Treasury agreed that the Egyptian figure of £E. 5,414,520 was correct.

Sir Stewart Symes was consulted on his way through Egypt on leave, and agreement was finally reached witn Amin Osnian Pasha for a reply to be given to the eftect that the Egyptian Lroyernment had initiated discussions with the necessary authorities and did not anticipate any difficulty in reaching a settlement. The parliamentary question was subsequently postponed indefinitely. In conversation with the Egyptian Prime Minister and Minister of Public Works in London in August, Sir Stewart Symes suggested that the Egyptian appointed to this post might be either a commercial agent accredited to the Sudan Government or could be attached to an appropriate Department of that Government. Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha expressed his preference for a commercial agent with his own office and staff to be established at Khartum as a charge on the Egyptian Government. Sir Stewart Symes agreed to this. Early in December the Council of Ministers approved the appointment of Abdulla Abaza Bey to this post. He had previously held com mercial posts and was recently elected Deputy and made president of the Parliamentary Committee for Commerce and Industry. It is understood that the Sudan Government were satisfied with this appointment. Egyptian forces. 100. No further Egyptian troops were moved to the Sudan during the year. The presence of the Egyptian battalion already in the Sudan led to no difficulties apart from one or two minor misunderstandings which some sections of Egyptian opinion tried to exaggerate. One of these concerned the class in which Egyptian officers travel on the Sudan railways, and another the right of the Egyptian troops to parade with fixed bayonets at Ramadan. It was found that, in spite of the agreement reached with Ihe Egyptian authorities in 1937 (annual report for 1937, paragraph 198), the British Officer Commanding the Troops in the Sudan was using the title of General Officer Commanding. After some correspondence, the War Office confirmed their agreement to the title,. Major-General Commanding. Some press agitation was caused in Egypt by the return to Egypt of Ali Abdel Latif, an Egyptian officer who had been imprisoned for mutiny after the 1924 disturbances and had subsequently lost his reason. Irrigation. 101. The Egyptian Government officially took over the Jebel Aulia Dam on its completion on the 28th April. The Prime Minister wrote to the Governor- General expressing appreciation for all the facilities rendered by the Sudan Government and remarked that the co-operation of the Sudan authorities had not been less because this was the first enterprise undertaken by the Egyptian Govern ment in*the Sudan in which there was no direct interest to the Sudan. In Sep tember, owing to the unusually high Nile flood, the Egyptian irrigation authorities maintained the level of water behind the dam at a greater height than was laid down in a document known as “ The WMrking Arrangements for Operating the Jpbel Aulia Dam,” which had been compiled for the use of the Egyptian Minister of Public Works in consultation with the Sudan authorities. The Acting Governor- General wrote to the Prime Minister expressing surprise that this action should have been taken without the previous consent of the Sudan Government and suggesting certain time limits for lowering the height of water, which would make the measures taken by the Egyptian authorities acceptable to the Sudan Government. These suggestions were accepted by the Egyptian Government. 102. Discussions were carried on during the year between the technical experts of the Egyptian and Sudan Governments regarding the Sudan’s desire for a small increase in the amount of water allotted to them under the JNile Waters Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Egyptian Govern ment. The Sudan Government hope, by increasing the area of land under irriga tion in the Sudan, to offset some of the loss of revenue consequent on withdrawal of the Egyptian subvention (see above).38 Lake Tsana. + 1Q qq Maiestv’s Government had been con- 103.

Lake Tsana was one of the subjects mentioned at the Anglo-Italian negotiations m Rome m the spring. Alter some discussion a formula for a declaration by Italy on the subject was accepted by the British and Italian representatives. The Italian Government confirmed two assurances previously given to His Majesty s Government and the Egyptian Government to the effect that they were fully conscious of their obligations towards the United Kingdom in the matter of Lake Tsana. The declaration was accompanied by notes from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Egyptian Minister at Rome stating that His Majesty’s Government and Italian Government respectively agreed that the assurances given in the above declaration applied equally to the Egyptian Government. Shortly after the Rome Agreements were concluded, instructions were received from the Foreign Office to make further and more detailed enquiries of the Egyptian Government and Sudan Government as to the desirability of spending money on a dam scheme at Lake Tsana in view of the control which Italy would exercise over any such works. The Governor-General was asked for his observations immediately, but it was suggested to the Foreign Office that it might be unwise to ask the Egyptian Government for their views before the attitude of His Majesty’s Government themselves had become more definite. The Govei nor-General replied that the possible nuisance value of hydraulic works at Lake Tsana in Italian hands would be outweighed by the potential advantages of the scheme for the Sudan. He therefore recommended that Italy should be asked at once to make a specific agreement permitting the erection of a dam, but not 5 nd S .

Participation of the h&gt;udan in International Conventions and Conferences. arranged at the end of 1937, this question was taken up with the Ministry for horeign Affairs by means of a memorandum communicated to the Under-beeretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 14th January, reiterating the proposals already made to Makram Pasha, and particularly the suggestion that, at international conferences of a purely scientific and non-diplomatic character, it would be convenient for the Sudan Government to be separately represented by experts rather than by experts attached to the British and Egyptian delegations. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, inspired by Bedawi Pasha, objected to practically all these proposals and particularly that concerning representation of the Sudan at scientific conferences. There followed lengthy correspondence between the Foreign Office, the embassy and the Sudan Government. One of the chief points at issue was whether the Sudan Government should accede to international conventions by means of the “ Colonial Clause,” which usually appeared in treaties to allow for the subsequent extension of the instrument to non-sovereign territories. After some hesitation, due to the natural fear of giving the Egyptian Government an opportunity to interfere in the administration of the Sudan, the Sudan authorities accepted the view that accession as a “ territory under suzerainty” would not be derogatory to their position, particularly if, for the purposes of correspondence leading up to or arising out of a convention, they were treated in the same way as Burma and Southern Rhodesia. No general reply was given to the Egyptian note, but, in a note of the 26th July, the embassy reiterated and expanded their proposals for Sudan representation at non-diplomatic conferences, making it clear that His Majesty’s Government were only proposing that the Sudan should have a separate delegation at conferences where colonial territories and territories under the suzerainty of a participating Power had delegations separate from those of their metropolitan countries. No reply had been received to this note at the end of the year. The Sudan Government were, in fact, represented at various minor con ferences by means of experts attached to the British and Egyptian delegations. A more complicated problem was presented by the Postal Conferences, because tbe Sudan Postal Administration had hitherto been closely connected with the Egyptian Postal Administration, particularly in matters affecting the telegraphic system. At the non-diplomatic postal conference, held in Cairo in the spring, the Sudan Government were represented by two expert observers. The Sudan Government have now decided to separate their Postal Administration entirely from that of Egypt, but this decision has not yet been communicated to the Egyptian Government. Visits of Foreign Aircraft and Warships. 105. Late in 1937 the Egyptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs were invitea in a note from the Embassy to consider the unification and simplification of the procedure for dealing with flights of foreign military and civil aircraft over the Sudan. It was suggested that applications for civil flights should be made by foreign legations in Cairo to the Sudan Agent, who would communicate the application to the Sudan Government and would inform the Egyptian Govern ment and the embassy, who would thus be able to express their views. For military flights applications should continue to be made to the Egyptian Govern ment and to His Majesty’s Government or the embassy, and permission should not be granted until consultation had taken place between the Egyptian and British military authorities. On the 29th January the Ministry for Foreign Affairs replied dissenting from the proposed procedure for civil flights mainly because it would establish the practice of direct communication between foreign missions in Cairo and the Sudan Agent, which they considered objectionable. They suggested instead that applications should be made by foreign missions to the Egyptian Ministry of Communications, who would transmit them to the Sudan agent and to the embassy. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs agreed to the proposed procedure for military flights. This note was followed by much40 correspondence with the Foreign 0ffi , c [^g^plify Seformalities for civil ^pffn the search for a procedure which would simp authorities^ Ml flights while giving the . r ® an d maintaining the tiovernor-Grene a opportunity to advise on militaiy high eement ^ finally reached, and on the anthority to sive a final decision.

The note suggested that the procedure for visits of foreign warships to the Sudan snou a be exactly the same as that for military flights. No answer had been received to this communication by the end of the year. Proposed Egyptian Maahad {Religious College). 106. Late in 1937 Sheikh Mustapha-el-Maraghi, rector of El Azhar, informed the Sudan Agency in Cairo that the Egyptian Government had asked him to draw up plans for the establishment of an Egyptian maahad in Khartum. The Governor-General caused a message to he communicated to him pointing to the risks of rivalry between a new Egyptian maahad and the existing maahad at Omdurman, and suggesting that it would be preferable for the Omdurman maahad, which was admittedly imperfect, to be reformed from within. On receipt of this message Sheikh-el-Maraghi suggested an alternative proposal for the affiliation of the Omdurman mosque to El Azhar. Sir Stewart Symes thought this proposal equally undesirable and instructed the Sudan Agent to inform Sheikh El Maraghi accordingly. Meanwhile, the press reported that on the 30th March the Council of Ministers had approved a proposal to build a maahad in Khartum. The ambassador took the opportunity of a visit to the Prime Minister shortly after this to call attention to the impropriety of such decisions being taken without official reference to the Governor-General. The Prime Minister admitted the force of this observation. In a subsequent conversation with Samuel Bey Atiyah of the Sudan Agency, Sheikh El Maraghi explained that the scheme was originated by the Nahas Government and not by El Azhar sSLinbw ^Jr tlan Gov e rnmell 1 t had only made their decision on the under standing that the Governor-General had been privately informed In a conversa- tion W! h the sheikh on the 11th May, the ambassador emphasised the neissitv eoLmhdroTTcMT and\?^^t^ t fi ed the Sudan the the time being d h * kh finally agreed not to P ress proposal for Bestowal of Egyptian Honours on Sudanese.

This question was the subject of lengthy discussions between the Sudan Agent and officials of the Ministry of Interior and the Passport Office. Agree ment was reached with these officials in August on a set of regulations giving a favoured position to British and Egyptian nationals and Egyptian Government officials of any nationality entering the Sudan, to Sudan Government officials entering Egypt in transit for the Sudan, and to Egyptian and British nationals and Egyptian Government officials of any nationality entering the Sudan in transit for Egypt, who would in each case receive free police control permits. British nationals, not being officials of the Sudan Government, entering Egypt in transit for the Sudan, would still require transit visas for Egypt. These proposals were submitted to the Minister of the Interior. Chapter V.— Relations with Other Countries. (a) General. Suez Canal. 109. The Suez Canal came very much into the limelight during the year. It was a prominent item in the negotiations leading to the Anglo-Italian (Rome) Agreement of April: and its security was a matter of acute concern during the international crisis of September. Finally, it gave rise, towards the end of the year, to a revived Italian press campaign for a reduction of dues, Italian representation on the board and the internationalisation of the administration. 110. The Suez Canal did not figure on the original agenda for the Anglo- Italian negotiations leading up to the Rome Agreement, but was added to it at the request of the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who informed His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome that all the Italian Government wished to secure was a reaffirmation of the International Convention of 1888 by which the free use of the Canal was guaranteed to all nations. He disclaimed any idea of asking for a share in the defence of the Canal. To this end they proposed a draft formula stating that the Italian and British Governments, considering that the Suez Canal was an essential means of communication between their metropolitan and imperial territories, confirmed their engagement to respect the rules laid down by the convention of 1888, particularly as regards the provisions for liberty of access and transit, neutralisation of the Canal, and the prohibition of blockade. His Majesty’s Government made a counter-proposal of a simple reaffirmation of the 1888 Convention as a whole, without mentioning any particular provision. Agreement was reached between Count Ciano and Lord Perth on a formula corres ponding to the idea of His Majesty’s Government, and this was then communi cated to the ambassador with instructions to inform the Egyptian Government and to discuss the question of their association with the proposed declaration. 111. On learning thus for the first time of the agreed formula, Sir Miles Lampson felt obliged to express his grave misgivings at its wording, which was such, in his opinion, as to strike at the whole strategical basis of our special position in Egypt. The preamble to the suggested declaration, by recording that the Suez Canal was an essential means of communication between Italy and Italian overseas territories, as well as between the United Kingdom and British overseas territories, used wording similar to that of article 8 of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, by which Egypt authorises the maintenance of British troops in the vicinity of the Canal. Sir Miles Lampson pointed out that this went a long way towards admitting that Italy had precisely similar grounds to ours for claiming to protect the Canal until Egypt could do so herself; and he foresaw the danger that Italy, with such a declaration in her possession, might be able to claim a recognised and special position. He proposed, in agreement with the Egyptian Prime Minister, that the declaration should be confined to a simple reaffirmation of the 1888 Convention, in default of which the preamble should be revised to render it as innocuous as possible. Lord Perth was eventually able to induce the Italian Government to agree to a simple reaffirmation of the intention of the two Governments to respect and abide by the provisions of the Convention of October 1888, as guaranteeing at all times and for all Powers the free use of the Suez Canal. Some difficulty was [19464] E *42 i i ± monf nvpr the form which the association of Egypt encountered at the last mome s p ou id take In order to meet Egyptian with the Anglo-Italian dec ^f ran „e f or the declaration to be commum- susceptibilities it was necebsa Rome bv Lord Perth and Count Ciano cated to the Egyptian Mmis ino&gt; ^ formally on record that the declara- respectively, under cover Pacing ^t iorma y of the territoria l in similar terms. 112 Throughout the year detailed arrangements for the defence of the Canal in an emergency had been under constant consideration by the British authorises concerned, with the dual object of having everything ready for an emergency and of bringing the purely British defence preparations as far as possible into line with post-treaty conditions The two points on which atten tion was principally concentrated were the police protection of the Canal against attempts at sabotage or blocking during the period prior to the assumption of control by the military, and the rapid installation of the examination batteries at the terminal ports on an emergency occurring. The mam difficulties encountered arose from the fact that while it was impossible, on the giounds of security, to inform the Egyptian Government of the whole scheme ot defence, it was indispensable under the changed conditions to take them to some extent into our confidence, and to secure their approval of measures relating to the rxoTiina /vno in iho q ocnmnfinn milltTrpv mntrol Ehe Suez Canal Conrpanv 113. The September crisis forced a decision on many defence matters on the Canal as elsewhere. Agreement was rapidly reached between the British and Egyptian authorities and the Canal Company for the provision of Egyptian police guards, for the control of suspect shipping in the period prior to the outbreak of war, and the construction of the gun emplacements for the batteries at the terminal ports was rushed through. The Canal Company participated in the construction of the emplacements at Port Said, and the British military authorities constructed similar emplacements at Suez at a site outside the com pany’s concession, with the knowledge and consent of both the Egyptian Govern ment and the company. The crisis showed, however, the serious risk which was being run by refraining from actually mounting the guns until hostilities had broken out, and when the year closed correspondence was actively proceeding between the various British authorities concerned, with a view to some more satisfactory arrangement being arrived at. liy: - ^onsiaeraDie correspondence passed between the ambassador and the Secretary of State on the question of the future organisation of the Canal ompany and, in particular, on the possibility of Italian participation on the • ° a A 01 admmistrat i on 0 f the company.

A reaction was naturally provoked in Egypt, and when, in December, Mr. Chamberlain stated in reply to a question in the House of Commons that His Majesty s Government would consult the French Government if Italy proposed any modification in the administration of the Canal, the Egyptian Government addressed to the ambassador a formal note placing on record that any proposals for modification would be of primary interest to Egypt as the territorial Power concerned, the authority which granted the Suez Canal concession in the first instance, and the ultimate successor to the Canal Company. The Egyptian Government accordingly claimed that they should be associated equally with the French Government in any negotiations which might arise out of proposals by Italy; and they expressed the hope that His Majesty's Government would find an opportunity to complete Mr. Chamberlain’s statement in the sense of associating Egypt with such negotiations. This action was supported in London by a demarche by the Egyptian Ambassador at the Foreign Office, when he protested against any idea of internationalisation on the basis that the Suez Canal must revert to the sole ownership of the Egyptian Government. 115. In view of the continued uncertainty and of the seeming encourage ment given to Italian claims in influential sections of the English press, such as The Times and the Spectator, the ambassador felt obliged to draw attention once more to the dangers of giving way to Italian agitation. He pointed out that even if the demand for a reduction of the dues was legitimate, it could probably not be supported by His Majesty’s Government without the risk of conflict with France and Egypt. He repeated his previous advice against the admission of an Italian director, which would be the first step towards inter nationalisation of the company (on the principle that its use entailed a right to participation in its management), and could not fail to weaken the physical control of the Canal which His Majesty’s Government were at present able to exercise. (b) Particular Countries. Palestine. 116. The sustained campaign of lawlessness and the continued unrest in Palestine placed the Egyptian Government in a most awkward position. On the one hand, they could not give the appearance of ignoring the promptings of the leading Egyptian divines or the pro-Arab partisanship of the Opposition and the greater part of the press. Nor were they allowed to forget that something more than benevolent neutrality was expected of them as the Government of the greatest independent State in Islam. Cairo was the natural meeting-place for those who desired to ventilate Arab grievances, and the Government could not for ever sit on the safety-valve. On the other hand—and especially in the autumn, when things were looking their blackest not only in Palestine but in Europe—they could not afford and did not wish to antagonise or embarrass their ally, Great Britain. Consequently, none was more anxious than they to see the end of the daily tales of battle, murder and sudden death, which lost nothing in the telling. Great credit is due to Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha for the correct attitude which he adopted locally and for the persistent efforts he made to bring about a detente and to dissuade the Palestine Arabs from making exorbitant and impossible demands. Abdul Fattah Yehia Pasha, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was equally correct when, in addressing the League Assembly, he pleaded for the maintenance of public order in Palestine and, whilst expressing sympathy for the Jews, argued that their sufferings could not be assuaged by injustice to the Arabs. 117. The publication of the British Government White Paper on the 4th January and the appointment of the Woodhead Commission did little to allay public feeling. They merely added to the prevailing uncertainty. Early in January a petition was sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador by some fifty Deputies and Senators calling attention to the unhappy effect of the events in 1 alestine and the dangers of the Zionist policy. On the arrival of the Woodhead Commission in Palestine in April demonstrations took place in Cairo and Alexandria, and deputations of students waited on the Prime Minister to protest against partition. These demonstrations caused some apprehension amongst the Jewish colony in44 Egypt, and the local Jewish leaders to the danger of an anl^Jewish movemenh Jn^act,^Uie^mOT ^ any serious extent, P^-'° d °^ e Dur ing the summer months the various the Egyptian press with som^succ | rab cau g e kept up a steady pro- pro-Aiab sociGtiGS in Ji/gyp &amp; i onKaprintion list for tliG I'GiiGt of paganda, and in July Nahas I asha °P e collected but little ot the sufferers in Palestine. A moderate sum on paper was “^Dut^^ money P—d was ^““‘'^^ikh Mustapha el-Mlraghi, he'd a meeting to^lSmssthe P^lestimlqiies^ion.and passed a number of resolutions .condemiung His Majesty’s Government’s policy and expressing dissatisfaction witn the state of affairs in Palestine. 118. Shortly after, active preparation began for the holding of the Parlia mentary Arab Congress organised by Alohamed Ah Allouba P ^h a - 1 e Secretary of State had represented to the Prime Minister, during the latter presence in London in August, the desirability that this congress should not be held in Cairo, but finally refrained from further objection on the Prime Minister s undertaking to keep a check on the proceedings, ihe congress was held m Cairo on the 7th October and following days. A number of resolutions were passed and communicated to His Majesty’s Ambassador, and on the 28th October Mohamed Ali Pasha Allouba and a few other delegates left for England to presmt their resolutions in person to the British Government. Before departure, Allouba Pasha was informed that his delegation could not be officially recognised in London, but in the event he was received as a distinguished member of the Egyptian Senate by Mr. Malcolm MacDonald. The Parliamentary Congress was followed by an Arab Women’s Congress under the presidency of Mme. Huda Sharawi, and also by a university students’ congress. The usual resolutions of disapproval of His Majesty’s Government’s Palestine policy were passed, and in less temperate form than was the case of the male congress. 119. The British Government’s statement of policy following upon the publication of the Woodhead report in November was greeted with approval; there were no tears shed over the death of “ partition ” and the invitation to send Egyptian representatives to the London Conference was warmly welc m d. The Prime Minister was at first anxious to lead the Egyptian delegation, but was less enthusiastic when he was told that the British Government could not meet his request for prior information regarding the limits to which His Majesty’s Govern ment m the United Kingdom were prepared to go in order to bring about a settlement. ° p.i \ a 1 i IP P revent irom doing his utmost to persuade the Palestine Arabs and the representatives of the neighbouring Arab States to forn something like a united front or presenting reasonable demands to His Majesty’* Government m the United Kingdom during the London Conference As the veai nWrl t0 h C ° Se ^ Wa fj buSlly en g a g ed in thi s work, which was more or less com pleted when, early in the new year, the Arab delegation met in Cairo on their wi\ to London.

Ihe successful negotiation of the Anglo-Italian (Rome) Agreement in April produced a detente in the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and led at first to exaggerated hopes among the Egyptians that it would be possible for them to relax their defence preparations. Apart from the provisions of the agreement relating to Lake Tsana,^ the Sudan frontiers and the Suez Canal which are dealt with elsewhere in this report, Egypt was concerned with the under takings by His Majesty’s Government and the Italian Government:— (a) To respect the status quo in the Mediterranean : (b) To exchange information regarding their military forces in Libya and East Africa and in Egypt and the Sudan respectively : and (c) The arrangement whereby the Italian Government were to reduce the strength of their military effectives in Libya to peace strength. As regards (r), some thousands of regular Italian troops were repatriated to Italy following upon the signature of the Rome Agreement. But the recrudescence of difficulties over Spain and the hesitation of His Majesty’s Government to bring the agreement into force led to a suspension of further withdrawals from the beginning of June, and the Italian forces in Libya were reinforced during the September crisis until they reached a level of strength which was probably higher than ever before. They remained thus throughout the rest of the year. Mean while, even during the period of withdrawals of men, the Italian Government were steadily accumulating war material of every sort in Libya. 123. It. was not long, therefore, before Egyptian optimism received a cold douche, and with the September crisis fear of Italy became stronger than ever and was not diminished by the Munich Agreement, especially as in October Libya was proclaimed to be an integral part of the metropolitan territory of Italy. 124. During the last stages of the Rome negotiations the Prime Minister put forward a proposal for some sort of political agreement between Egypt and Italy, which he variously envisaged as a “ Bon Voisinaqe ” Agreement covering the Libyan frontier or a general non-agression pact. The ambassador was success ful in riding off an attempt to incorporate this nebulous idea into the Rome conversations at the eleventh hour. As the Prime Minister was apparently keen on pursuing his scheme and had given instructions for a draft agreement to be prepared, Sir Miles Lampson warned him after consulting the Foreign Office that while His Majesty’s Government had naturally no objection to any agreement designed to improve relations between Egypt and Italy, it would be essential to ensure in the drafting and negotiating of the agreement that nothing was included which conflicted with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance. The Prime Minister gave a categorical assurance that this condition would be observed and that His Majesty’s Government would be fully consulted throughout. At the beginning of June, Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha informed the ambassador that he proposed to postpone the whole idea until the Rome Agreement had come into force. 125. During the September crisis the Italian Government approached the Egyptian Government again with assurances of their desire to remain on friendly terms with Egypt; and definite overtures appear to have been made to both King Farouk and the Prime Minister to the effect that if Egypt remained neutral m a European war Italy would guarantee not to attack her. According to the Prime Minister these overtures were rejected, and the Italians were informed that it was the intention of Egypt to remain loyal to the British Alliance. 126. In November the Egyptian Government followed the lead of His Majesty’s Government in recognising the Italian conquest of Abyssinia. The Prime Minister revived at this juncture his vague idea of the spring for a political agreement between Egypt and Italy, which he later turned into a proposal to include, in the exchange of notes recognising the Italian conquest of Abyssinia, an undertaking by the Italian Government to safeguard the free exercise of the Coptic religion in Abyssinia and the connexion of the Abyssinian and Egyptian Coptic Churches. This idea came to nothing and eventually the Egyptian Government decided to recognise without any attempt to attach condi tions to their recognition. Notes were also exchanged between the Egyptian Charge d’Affaires at Rome and the Italian Foreign Minister at this time recording that the declarations regarding Lake Tsana and the Suez Canal had come into force.46 127. In December the Italians took advantage of the vmveiling^Oof of the Khedive Ismail at Alexandria t0a , “jorjous signor Verucci friendship for Egypt. This stotue was designed by *® e ' a t o fommemorate Bey for presentation by tlie J 1,1 i 1 i ■ nnveiluig had to be postponed on account president of the Italian Senate, as their special re R I '®®®^ atlv ®; indebtedness of his speech, Signor Federzoni made a significant which restored the Italy to the Khedive Ismail as the creator of the Suez Canal which restoiert tne importance of the Mediterranean where Italians had to live and woid^. In reply Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha paid an eloquent tribute to the work of Signor Mussolini, and King Farouk sent messages of congratulation and friendship to both the King of Italy and the Duce. One important episode m connexion with this affair was the reinstatement of Verucci Bey as a member of King Farouk s personal staff. This individual had been dismissed from the Palace m 19db on the ground that he was, inter alia, an Italian agent, and his reappointment was singularly ill-timed. The ambassador promptly made appropriate representations both to the Prime Minister and to Aly Maher Pasha but at the end of the year there was nothing to show that King Farouk was disposed to cancel or shorten the contract on which Verucci Bey had been re-engaged. Belgium. 128. In June the Belgian Minister opened negotiations with the Egyptian Government for the conclusion of treaties of commerce and extradition, and also of consular and establishment conventions. The Belgian Government were anxious that all such agreements concluded with the Egyptian Government should conform with those eventually negotiated between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Egyptian Government. So far as is known, little progress was made during the year. Germany. 129. In September, announcements were published in the Official Journal showing that the Grand Cordon of the Order of the German Eagle had been bestowed on Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha, the Prime Minister, Aly Maher Pasha, the head of the Royal Cabinet, and Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha, Minister for Foreign Affairs; and that the Grand Cordon of the Order of Ismail had been conferred on Herr Ribbentrop while a number of officials in the German Ministry o Foreign Affairs had received the Order of the Nile. This announcement, coming as it did on top of the international crisis, appeared to be ill-timed but it subsequently transpired that the exchange of decorations had been arranged early m the year at the time of the King’s marriage. The official announcement of the exchange was merely a belated announcement of an accomplished fact.

Ratifications of the Turco-Egyptian Treaty of Friendship of 1937 were exchanged in Cairo on the 11th April, 1938, during the course of a formal visit paid by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. Rustu Aras was accorded an exceptionally warm welcome in Egypt and allowed it to be under stood that Kamel Ataturk had invited King Farouk to visit Turkey in the near future. He denied rumours to the effect that one of the objects of his visit had been to induce the Egyptain Government to adhere to the Saadabad Treaty between Turkey, Iraq and Iran. U.S.S.R. 134. On the 28th June the Egyptian Prime Minister was asked in Parlia ment whether it was the intention of the Government to continue to have no relations with the U.S.S.R. The question was answered by the Minister of Public Works who stated that this matter was under examination. In August conversations were carried on in Istanbul between the Soviet Embassy and the Egyptian Legation with a view to establish the conditions on which commercial relations could be placed on a sound basis : and in November the Director-General of Public Security stated that the Government had approved the entry into Egypt of a small Soviet Commercial Mission. By the end of the year, however, no request for visas had been made. The aim of the Egyptian Government in this question is obviously to regain a lost market for their raw cotton, but in view of the production of cotton in the U.S.S.R. itself it is very doubtful whether they will succeed even if commercial relations are resumed.one year Eire...

[J 2805/2805/16] Sir M. Lampson to Viscount Halifax.—(Received Jidy 18.) (No. 770.) My Lord, ^ Alexandria, June 30, 1938. : I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith my annual report on Egypt for the year 1937. 2. The year was one which, on the surface at all events, opened full of promise for Egypt. The ratifications of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty had been exchanged at the end of December 1936, and Egypt thus began her career as a fully independent State. The treaty had been achieved by an outward appearance of national unity, and the year should have been occupied with the detailed application of the treaty and with internal reorganisation. 3. It was perhaps too much to hope that the United Front would remaiu united after the treaty had been concluded, and, quite apart from the natural interplay of personal jealousies, there was a rising feeling against Nahas Pasha’s habit of self-glorification, while the removal of the treaty issue from the political arena only drew attention to the neglected state of internal administration. , 4. In the event, the year was almost completely sterile from the internal point of view. Owing to the preoccupation of the Government with external affairs and with internal political difficulties, no major administrative or legis lative measures were put into effect, and the administrative machine functioned with decreasing efficiency both at the centre and in the provinces. Dissensions appeared in the Wafd itself, and the increasing antagonism between the young King and Nahas Pasha, fostered by the latter’s political opponents, ended at the close of the year with the dismissal of the Nahas Cabinet. 5. For the first half of the year the country was still administered under the aegis of the Regency Council, and King Farouk, though making a bid for personal popularity, was not a major factor in the political situation. Between the end of February and July His Majesty was, in fact, absent from Egypt on an unofficial visit to England and to Switzerland (during which he incidentally betrayed a degree of irresponsibility, unpunctuality and lack of consideration which boded no good for the future). Immediately on his return to Egypt, however, he showed that he proposed to lose no time in asserting his authority, and his first clash with Nahas Pasha took place over the details of the accession ceremony at the end of July. From this time the contest between a self-willed monarch and an imprudent and often tactless Prime Minister rapidly developed. Its course was followed with concern by the Embassy, which was in a difficult position. Active intervention was not in accordance with the treaty. Neverthe less, intervention was expected on all sides in Egypt, and it was impossible, in any case, not to feel a certain moral responsibility. There was a natural reluctance also on the part of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, alive though they were to Nahas Pasha’s errors and shortcomings, to see thedisappearance of a Prime Minister who had negotiated the Treaty of Alliance and was loyally co-operating in its application. The policy followed was to counsel moderation on both sides and to urge that, in the face of an increasingly dangerous international situation, domestic unity should be preserved. For some time an uneasy balance was maintained in this way, but King Farouk was self- confident and' Nahas Pasha and his chief henchman, Makram Ebeid Pasha, clearly relied too much upon British influence, in spite of the changed situation created by the treaty, to keep the Wafd Government in power. By December the situation had become impossible and Nahas Pasha fell from power. There is no doubt that he blamed us, both because we did not intervene more actively to maintain him and because we had counselled moderation and had restrained him from dealing with the King in his own way, at the risk of an open breach at an earlier stage. The Wafd thus went out of office in a mood of antagonism towards us, which may yet have far-reaching consequences. 6. As regards external affairs, there were two outstanding events : the abolition of the Capitulations by the Montreux Convention and the entry of Egypt into the League of Nations at a special session of the Assembly which followed closely upon the Montreux Conference. 7. The ground for the Montreux Convention had been carefully prepared by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Egyptian Govern ment in mutual consultation, and there is no doubt that the Egyptians were genuinely grateful for and impressed by the support which they obtained from the British side at the Montreux Conference. This, and the manner in which Egypt’s entry into the League was sponsored by Great Britain, produced a marked feeling of cordiality in the relations between the two countries. 8. The effective termination of the capitulatory regime came about on the 15th October, when the Montreux Convention entered into force. There was, however, no abrupt transition. The convention was in the nature of a com promise, for it prolonged the existence of the Mixed Courts for a period of twelve years, and it is not until the expiration of that period that foreigners who previously enjoyed capitulatory rights will come under the full jurisdiction of the national courts. Furthermore, the convention provided that consular courts might be retained at the option of the Powers concerned during the transition period for personal status cases. The criminal and other civil jurisdiction of the consular courts ceased entirely, however, except in the case of the British consular court, which, for the purpose of the Immunities Convention attached to the Tieaty of Alliance, becomes a military court with limited criminal jurisdiction over members of the British forces in Egypt and of the military mission, and their families. The reconstituted British consular court was established by an Order m Council which came into force on the 15th October. 9. This general review would not be complete without some mention of the manner m which the Treaty of Alliance has been applied. The main develop ment has been the formation of an advisory military mission under Major- L ' ¥ al l sha P 11 -? OTnwa ll 1 ’ C B - C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C. The mission found ^at nothimj short of the complete reorganisation of the Egyptian army was cessaiy lf '/ IS to be turned into a modern fighting force. A very thorough survey was made and considerable progress was achieved in the preliminafy s ages of reorganisation. The mission fs, however, under no illusion as to the atmtitr tht rani ttd fiAL fT'? m ^ mly from the low standard of education lack o S f militar • kck ° f s ' ltable officers, political intrigue, and the lack ol military qualifications among Egyptians generally The re-eauimnent of BihFs&amp;mntrn Ind'tUt 80 W ' th owing^to the pksluTon fte Jji itisn armament industry m connexion with our own defence DroPTammp TbK JurrLvXn Co al ° f dls ® a ^ sfactlon and ha s enabled interested parties for tfeir milftSf^pp^r ‘ ^ ^ t0 tlme t0 tum to othCT co ™‘' ies the ttLsfokof’ th^B^tL^rnimCvT 84 hui ,! din g P r .°g ramme to make possible Canal Zone.

Out of the 11 officers and 81 constables ivho left Egypt in 1937, 4 officers and 59 constables had obtained other employment by the 31st December. 13. I have dealt above with the main events of the year in which Egypt was directly concerned. There were, however, two external factors which, though sometimes vague and ill-defined, yet had a constant and powerful indirect influence on Anglo-Egyptian relations. I refer to the tension between Great Britain and Italy and to British policy in Palestine. 14. The attitude of Great Britain in the Abyssinian conflict had aroused the hostility of Italy, who set herself by every means in her power to undermine British influence in the Near East. Mussolini’s assumption of the role of Protector of Islam, the venomous Italian propaganda against Great Britain both in the Italian and in the Near Eastern press and the Bari broadcasts, coupled with Italian intrigues in Palestine and elsewhere, all seemed designed to rouse the Arab world against us. The Italian reinforcements which were increasingly poured into Libya could only be taken as a threat of an attack upon us in Egypt, while the conflict in Spain threatened to provide the incident which might set the armies in motion. Our main preoccupation in Egypt as the year went on thus became the question of defence. The Egyptians were increasingly alarmed by Italian preparations, and Nahas Pasha showed that he was prepared to go to any lengths in collaboration with us in defence measures. With the object of producing eventually a combined plan for the defence of Egypt, preliminary discussions between the British naval, military and air authorities concerned took place in October in Alexandria, and the glaring defects in the existing defence arrangements and in the strength, equipment and armament of the British forces were brought urgently to the notice of His Majesty’s Government, who, in advance of any defence plan, agreed to provide the Egyptian Government with certain coast defence equipment and sanctioned various measures for the reinforcement and better equipment of the British forces. 15. The tension with Italy, however, combined with exaggerated accounts of our inability to supply the Egyptian army with war material, produced a growing suspicion, fostered by Italy, that Great Britain was not in a position to protect Egypt from Italian aggression and that the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, indeed involved Egypt in grave risk by tying her to British policy. Sidky Pasha made himself the'exponent of this doctrine, and favoured the idea of a “ reinsurance ” treaty with Italy. 16 In these circumstances it was doubly unfortunate that we were pursuing in Palestine a policy which was clearly estranging the Moslem world. The rU tkA Eo-vntian Government was correct and restrained, but sympathy against us, and tm in Spain, the Med Palestine a course which threatened to alienate our Arab and Egyptian friends.

THE year 1936 closed with growing evidence of discontent at the short comings of Nahas Pasha’s Ministry. 2. During the succeeding months the volume of criticism began to become a source of serious embarrassment to the Government. In Parliament, it is true, . e Wafd remained in undisputed control, the Opposition being inactive and ineffective. But outside Nahas Pasha was beginning to kxse some of his popular appeal. The main cause for this loss of popularity was the decline in the Government s administrative efficiency and its excessive favouritism. Since the advent of the AVafd to power, its leaders had been fully occupied with treaty negotiations, and routine work had been allowed to slide and accumulate. After he ratification of the treaty, the Ministers were faced with large arrears of work, ur * a ji ^ k.° ^ ac V e problem and occupied themselves with social functions, wi endless interviews, and with efforts to satisfy the demands of their followers, some of whom were appointed to key posts in various Ministries, where they ciea e con usion. As a result, the machinery of Government deteriorated appreciably at the centre, though this deterioration had not yet spread to the provinces. J ^ • „ Fp 6 ^^ scontent aroused by this inefficiency and nepotism was further mpnt w bj E ^ 0vei ? len ^ started early in January, and sponsored by the Govern ment, tor a national subscription to provide funds to strengthen the country’s, e fT 1 . 06 forces. I he I rime Minister and his colleagues subscribed a month's pay nis i)efence Fund, and their example was followed by others, until it became virtually compulsory for all officials. As a result, there arose a widespread intensive anti-Government campaign among the official classes in the country. 4 Within the Cabinet, and the Wafd leadership itself also, there were signer of a rift. The old division between Nahas Pasha and Makram Ebeid Pasha on the one hand and Dr. Ahmed Maher and Nokrashi Pasha on the other, persisted, and was growing sharper. The hostility of the latter was due partly to genuine disgust with the incompetence and nepotism which was sapping the strength of the Wafd, and partly to their dislike of Makram’s domination over Aahas. Other Ministers were now also becoming restive. Nahas Pasha rarely consulted members of his Cabinet other than Makram Ebeid Pasha, and the other Ministers objected to this cavalier treatment. 5. Nahas Pasha was also imprudent in making no effort to conciliate the Regents, or the King and those who exercised influence over His Majesty. The Prince Regent, who had started with, if anything, a bias in favour of the Wafd, soon changed his views and began to express distrust of the Wafd Government, whose incompetence and demagogy he regarded as provocative of revolutionary developments. The King, equally neglected by the Wafd, was entirely under the influence of the Wafd's enemies and inevitably soon developed an intense dislike of Nahas Pasha and his Government. 6. The Palace were not slow to take advantage of Nahas Pasha’s difficulties. Everything was done to make King Farouk a popular figure. By weekly attendances at mosques, by frequent appearances at festivals, sporting events, &amp;c., and by propaganda in the press Flis Majesty’s activities were kept constantly before the public eye. Furthermore, a tour in Upper Egypt undertaken by His Majesty, accompanied by Queen Nazli and the King’s sisters, proved a great success, and caused concern to Nahas Pasha, who postponed indefinitely a similar tour which he had proposed to make, for fear that his reception by the people might compare unfavourably with that accorded to His Majesty. 7. From his tour in Upper Egypt King Farouk returned to Cairo on the 4th February. His Majesty again departed from Cairo on the 27th February for Europe. 8. Sir M. Lampson presented his credentials as British Ambassador to the Court of Abdin on the 12th January. 9. In view of the dangers threatening the Government owing to its inadequacies, the Ambassador took an opportunity early in March to speak to Nahas Pasha. The Prime Minister had complained of the growing campaign of opposition and intrigue against the Government. The Ambassador replied that the fault lay perhaps with the Government themselves, and pointed out that the interference of the Parliamentary Under-Secretaries with the Administration, favouritism and the 'Defence Fund” subscriptions, were creating a current hostile to the Wafd in the country. Nahas Pasha argued that the criticisms were not really justified. He had been forced to give Parliamentary U nder-Secretaries of State administrative functions as he could not count on the loyalty of the permanent officials, and, as regards the charge of favouritism he was only reinstating Wafdists who had been turned out during previous dictatorial regimes. Shortly afterwards, however, the Government passed an informal decision to cease making any more exceptional appointments, promotions and increases of pay. 10 On the 3rd March the Liberal Constitutional party held a meeting under Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha at which a resolution was passed wishing the Government success at the approaching Montreux Conference. Othei Opposition elements adopted a similarly benevolent official attitude, with the ostensible objee of avoiding anv action that might embarrass the Government during the con ference The position within the Wafd also appeared to improve towards the middle of March Nahas Pasha and Makram Ebeid Pasha discussed matters frankly with Dr. Ahmed Maher and Nokrashi p ash a and the prospects of a pi t in the Wafd became temporarily more remote. Nahas Pasha also neia successful meeting of the Wafdist parliamentary body at which he pJacated his critics by promilng to keep that body more fully informed m future of the Government’s actions. r* 2 [17725]n ^fndpnt disturbances now occurred again, precipitated by a petition emanating from E Azhar demanding religious teaching and the separation of “ es fn rumversitv. Serious brawling between students resulted in a number of casualties and the ^hce had to e J to restore order There were also some sympathetic school stukes at Alexandria and in the provinces The Government, after some days at last issued a com- muiiiquf threatening students with the full rigour of the law, and order was restored. . r i 8 12. The Government was, however, clearly undecided how to deal with the student problem, and was uncertain in its own mind whether to take forcible action against them or to tolerate their misbehaviour m the hope of keeping them on the Wafd’s side for future action when necessary. 13. These disturbances were instigated by the Opposition leaders and, according to some reports, also by the Italians, who had agents m the Azhar and who, in the past, had been in touch with Ahmed Hussein, the leader of the Grpipn shirts. 14. The Opposition, whilst officially advocating calmness during the Mon- treux Conference, was quietly laying its plans to make capital out of the lesults, and, as evidenced by these student disturbances, continued secretly to instigate trouble for the Government. The Government had invited the Opposition leaders to a consultation of the United Front to discuss the attitude to be adopted by the Egyptian delegation at Montreux. The leaders refused, saying that there had been no contract between the Cabinet and the other parties represented in the United Front for several months, but they wished the Government success and assured them of their support. This decision of the minority leaders left no doubt that the “ United Front ” had now definitely disintegrated. 15. The unsatisfactory situation arising from the deterioration in the Administration together with the possibility of eventual conflict between the popular party and the Palace caused His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to consider the question of the extent to which His Majesty’s represen tative in Cairo, in his new role as Ambassador, should exert his influence in future in the Egyptian political field. 16. Sir M. Lampson was requested to submit his views as to whether British influence should not now be used persistently, not only in isolated matters of transitory importance, but in the tendering of advice with a view to maintaining the internal policy and the administration in Egypt on the proper lines. The Secretary of State expressed the opinion that perhaps a new technique was required to enable the Ambassador to exercise almost as much influence as High Commissioners of earlier days. In reply, Sir M. Lampson considered that it should still be possible to exert a powerful and beneficial influence on the policy and administration of the country, but was not in favour of doing so by official and formal action. With the Wafd in power some deterioration in adminis tration was inevitable. The Wafd were also jealous of Egypt’s newly-won independence and might resent advice if tendered officially and unasked. In Sir M. Lampson’s opinion the Wafd would either profit by experience, reform itself and administer with greater competence, or be superseded by a more competent Government. Meanwhile, the aim of the British should be to maintain a friendly atmosphere in which quietly and unobtrusively British influence could make itself felt. Despite a tendency of the Egyptians to kick over the traces, there were already signs that they were turning to us for unofficial guidance. It would be a mistake to exercise influence too openly or officially, but. with tact and firmness, ritish influence should remain the governing factor with all Egyptian Adminis trations undei the new conditions of the post treaty regime. 17. + n t ^ ie Office considered that there was much force in the , ™f n W orward by the Ambassador and agreed that he should continue to deal with the situation as he was already doing.

Meetings took7 33 [17725] place m Alexandria between Ali Maher Pasha, Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha, Ismail oi 1 asna and Hassan Sabry Pasha, all of whom had postponed their departure to Europe. iYh Maher Pasha had in fact'—he himself said so to the Ambassador —on the eye of his departure, received a message from King Farouk asking him to remain in Egypt and watch developments on his behalf. There was, at this juncture, talk of the possible formation of some form of coalition Government a i ? arou ^ s ac . c ® ss i on - But, during April and May, there was on the whole little internal political activity in the country. 19. I he progress of the negotiations at Montreux was followed with great interest in Egypt and the success finally obtained by the Egyptian delegation greatly improved the position of Nahas Pasha and his Government. The Opposi tion realised that they could not attack the Government on the Montreux issue, so favourable to Egypt, and it was generally felt that no serious offensive against the Government would materialise before the autumn, by which time further deteriora tion in the administration of the country would possibly provide useful material. Dissensions in the ranks of the Wafd, however, still continued, Nokrashi Pasha being the outstanding thorn in Nahas Pasha’s flesh. The attitude of Dr. Ahmed Maher, which was of greater importance, as he counted for more with the Egyptian public, was also uncertain, although it was felt that he might with tactful handling be prevented from seceding from the Wafd for the moment. 20. During the absence in Europe of Nahas Pasha, Makram Ebeid Pasha and Wacyf Ghali Pasha, who were the principal members of the Egyptian delegation at Montreux, Osman Moharram Pasha, the Minister of Public Works, was acting Prime Minister, Nokrashi Pasha became acting Minister of Finance and Mahmoud Ghaleb Pasha held the portfolio of Foreign Affairs. 21. The Montreux Convention was signed on the 8th May and Nahas Pasha and Wacyf Ghali Pasha, who, with Prince Abdel Moneim, had been appointed to represent Egypt at the coronation of His Majesty King George VI, at once left for London for this purpose. The next event was the special session of the League Assembly at Geneva, where, at a session on the 26th May presided over by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Tevfik Rii§tu Aras, Egypt was admitted to membership of the League, having had the satisfaction of receiving beforehand (through the instrumentality of His Majesty’s Government) invita tions from thirty-three States members of the League to put forward her candidature. 22. Nahas Pasha and the other Egyptian delegates, with the exception of Wacyf Ghali Pasha, returned to Alexandria on the 3rd June. They were greeted by large crowds and given a public ovation. They were obviously pleased the success of their mission, and Nahas Pasha and Makram Ebeid Pasha both spoke enthusiastically to the Ambassador of the support and assistance they had received from His Majesty’s Government throughout the Montreux Conference and the proceedings leading up to the election of Egypt as a member of the League, The delegates proceeded to Cairo on the 6th June and were again the object ot a popular ovation both en route and in the capital. A notable feature of e several speeches delivered by Nahas Pasha at various functions organised m his honour was the repeated assurance given by him to foreigners resident m Egypt of the goodwill, hospitality and spirit of toleration which they would always find in this country. 23 The Prince Regent, who had, on the 26th March, had a sudden attack of anaina pectoris which caused anxiety and prevented him from heading the Ee-vpfian delegation to the coronation in London, sailed from Alexandria foi Egyptian aeieg _ Highness, before his departure, sent a EUr0P fNo the Ambassador of which the “substance was briefly that he much Ced g the WaM would attempt to whittle away Kmg Farouk’s prerogatives iea f e fr, f Pp bnncd that the Embassy would support the King m defending his and that he hoped that 7 Dresent Government that British interest rights and that the Bntmh had no intention of relinquish- ing the P ir T ‘ voTx an cLpitre ” as a result of recent political changes. 24- During June amd^Julynhe^fa^t^two^nmuths^after^the^return^of the reasonablenes^and’statesmanship m his conduct of affairs. In internal affarrsthere was less evidence of flagrant favouritism and other abuses, and in his relations with the British, the Prime Minister was helpful m the liquidation of the many questions arising out of the treaty, such as the return of the Egyptian troops to the Sudan and the future of the Frontiers Administration. Moreover, Nanas Pasha’s attitude over the Palestinian question was most correct and m accordance with the conduct to be expected fiom the Piime Minister of an allied State His tendency to turn more and more to us for advice was further evidence of his belief in the value of Anglo-Egyptian co-operation. 25 The Montreux Convention was ratified by the Egyptian Parliament on the 2nd August. More than three ratifications having been notified to the Egyptian Government before the 15th October, the new regime came into force on that date. 26. King Farouk, who returned from Europe to Egypt on the 25th July, was given an enthusiastic welcome on landing at Alexandria and on his journey to Cairo. His Majesty’s formal accession to the throne took place on the 29th July, on which date the Regency Council ceased its functions. The transition was marked by a simple ceremony at the Chamber of Deputies when His Majesty took the oath to the Constitution. 27. Almost immediately on King Farouk’s return to Egypt there appeared signs of friction between His Majesty and Nahas Pasha. Serious disagreement arose between them, for instance, on the question whether a religious ceremony was to form part of the accession proceedings, as well as over the drafting of a speech which the King was to broadcast to the nation, and over a proposal made by Nahas Pasha to introduce changes in the army oath of loyalty and to include in it a reference to the Constitution. 28. On the accession of the new King, the Prime Minister, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, tendered his formal resignation. On the 1st August a royal order was issued charging Nahas Pasha to form a new Cabinet. The new Ministry was appointed on the 3rd August and was constituted as follows :— Nabas Pasha : Prime Minister and Interior. Makram Ebeid Pasha : Finance. Seif-el-Nasr Pasha : War. Wacyf Ghali Pasha : Foreign Affairs. Osman Moharram Pasha : Public Works. Zaky-el-Oraby Pasha : Communications. Mahmoud Bassiouni : Wakfs. Maitre Sabry Abu Hem : Justice. Maitre Abdel Fattah-el-Tawil : Public Health. Mahmoud Bey Khalil: Agriculture. Abdel Salam Gomaa Pasha : Commerce and Industry and Education. INahas Pasha had taken the opportunity to drop Nokrashi Pasha and three other Ministers whom he had found difficult and obstructive. 29. I he reconstitution of the Cabinet gave rise to yet another serious dispute between the King and his Prime Minister. Nahas Pasha wished to appoint Tousset-el-Guindi, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Interior, as Minister of Education. The King categorically refused, on the grounds that uindi was dishonest This was generally regarded as a severe blow for Nahas asha, whose devoted henchman Guindi was, and for some days the tension between the Prime Minister and the Palace was extremely acute. i • r ‘ • ' n v ^ ew Nokrashi Pasha’s frequent opposition to the Prime Minister, was P.^U ia P s 2 l ; m derstandable, but his departure greatly strengthened men? nffprld 1 &lt; y positlon „ Prevent, if possible, his active opposition, the Govern- hit Nol f UtUi 0 f- th i e t gyptlan directorships on the Suez Canal Board, to bf enifsHnf th ha decIm ® d ‘P offer &gt; and n was n °t l°“g before he was reported 31.

Nahas Pasha, besides being genuinely convinced that His Majesty should invariably accept the advice of his Ministers, felt an uncontrollable personal jealousy at the arrival on the scene of a new factor m the shape of a popular Monarch who, in virtue merely ot his youth and position, was definitely sharing the public enthusiasm hitherto reserved for Nahas Pasha himself. The King, on his side, believed it nis duty to accept his Ministers’ advice only when he agreed with it, and was convinced that Nahas Pasha was aiming at a virtual dictatorship and the thrusting of the monarchy into the background. His Majesty felt, moreover, to the fullest degree the contempt which his father, and for that matter the whole Royal Family, had always entertained for Nahas Pasha as an Egyptian demagogue sprung from the fellaheen, and for Makram Ebeid Pasha as a low-class Copt. King Farouk might, however, have been willing to smother his resentment and play for time for a longer period had it not been for the weakening in public estimation of the Wafd Government and party owing to the discarding of Nokrashi Pasha with its accompanying antagonism of Dr. Ahmed Maher. 33. The open rupture between the Wadf and Nokrashi Pasha did not take place immediately. On the 23rd August a meeting in commemoration of Zakhlul Pasha in Cairo was disturbed by a clash between Nokrashi’s partisans and the Blueshirts, the latter ejecting Nokrashi’s partisans, one of whom was badly injured. On the following day Nahas Pasha, Makram Pasha, Dr. Ahmed Maher and Nokrashi Pasha met under the mgis of Mme. Zaghlul and further conversa tions took place at Alexandria. These attempts at reconciliation ended in failure, largely, it was thought, on account of Makram Pasha, and on the 14th September the Wafd voted the dismissal of Nokrashi Pasha—only Dr. Ahmed Maher voting against. 34. Personal ill-feeling between Nahas Pasha and the King was fed by constant small incidents, and towards the end of August Sheikh El Maraghi, who undoubtedly played an important part in influencing the King and stirring up opposition to the Wafd throughout these months, sounded His Majesty s Embassy as to the possibility of King Farouk demanding the immediate dissolution of all unconstitutional organisations (meaning, of course, the Blueshirts) and, if this were refused, dismissing Nahas Pasha and replacing him by a Cabinet of Wafdist complexion, with Dr. Ahmed Maher as Prime Minister. On the 31st August Ali Maher Pasha (at that time still a private individual) called on His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and made the same proposal, although, on finding that it 'was not welcome, he professed to have himself discouraged it as premature. He violently denounced Nahas and Makram Pashas citing, m particular the former’s unprecedented action of having himself publicly prayed for in the mosques; and while he admitted the value to His Majesty s Govern ment of the maintenance of the existing Government for the execution of the treaty said that if it came to be said that the treaty had saddled Egypt with Nahfs Pasha and Makram Pasha indefinitely, there would be revulsion against the treaty itself. 35 The line taken by His Majesty's Embassy throughout these months was that in the interests of stability, it was most undesirable for a young and inexperienced King to begin his reign by entering the political arena and r ^ n Prime Minister who still enjoyed a large parliamentary majority of Egyptians; and that His Majest/s and tne appaic pp nndrmbfpd feelino' which was being caused by proper line was to y a y t 4,1™^ and tbe exclSsion of a11 th 1 from il staid have created a plain issue on which the King independent eleme difficulty which His Majesty's Embassy experienced, koih inkmveying this idea to j a 7'k a t h faS*°rom Ihe'TlaceT/an^ For this reason they Mt earlyin August the vital need of filling the vacant post of ‘‘ chef oabmet ” with a responsible politician, and there seemed no doubt that on balance the perso indicated was Ali Maher Pasha himself. His Majesty s Charge d Atlaires indicated this view to Amin Osman Pasha when the latter, on the Hth September, told him that Nahas Pasha was thinking of proposing to the King as alternatives the names of two of his own Ministers, the ex-Prime Minister Tew fik Nessim Pasha and the King’s prospective father-in-law. Other opportunities were taken of suggesting to Nahas Pasha and to Makram Pasha the appointment of Ah Maher”Pasha, but unfortunately both Ministers took tne line that such an appointment would be regarded as a victory for the Palace party over the Watd, and nothing was done about it. 36. The Secretary of State telegraphed on the 9th September enquiring whether strong representations to the King (stating that His Majesty s Government stronqly deprecated a change of Government) would be desnable. ITis Majesty s Charge d Affaires was asked whether, if the Government could be kept in power until Parliament was assembled, its chances of further survival would be enhanced; whether the advice so far tendered would probably not be sufficient to save it; and whether, if we were to succeed in postponing the fall of the Government, such a success would prove sooner or later costly by antagonising the various Opposi tion elements, including the King. He replied that if Nahas Pasha were still in power when Parliament reassembled he should be sure of an overwhelming majority for several months, that the advice given to Ali Maher Pasha and his friends had led them to shelve the couf which they had projected in August, and that strong representations on the lines suggested, while likely to have the desired immediate effect, would inevitably also prove costly in the long run. This view was adopted by His Majesty’s Government. 37. The engagement of King Farouk to Mile. Farida Zulficar, daughter of Youssef Zulfiear Pasha, a judge of the Mixed Courts, was announced on the 25th August. 38. Tension between the Government and the Palace was increased when, on the 27th September, Nahas Pasha tried to hold a demonstration in connexion with the funeral of twenty.-two workmen who were crushed to death during a loyal demonstration in front of the Royal Palace, and was abruptly ordered by the King, through the Governor of Alexandria, to abandon his intention. On the 7th October Nahas Pasha announced that, in accordance with article 41 of the Constitution, Parliament would be summoned to an extraordinary session on the 23rd October to ratify the decree putting the Montreux Convention into force and for certain urgent financial measures. This coincided with the coming to a head of a new quarrel over the appointment of an unimportant Palace official. The Government had contended that a law of 1925 under which the King had acted in making this appointment had been abrogated by a further law of 1936. The King had instructed Nahas Pasha to get the opinion of the Contentieux, and Bedawi Pasha, the head of the Contentieux, who was on definitely bad terms with the Government and consulted by them as little as possible, had pronounced in tayour of the King. Nahas Pasha and Makram Ebeid Pasha, however, treated is opinion as a matter for the Government alone, and proposed to submit the matter to the Council of Ministers. Taken in conjunction with Nahas’s deter- mmation to summon an extraordinary session of Parliament, this gave the King w it laher Pasha the impression that Nahas Pasha would use his majority, i A,lmed M aher and Nokrashi Pasha had time to undermine it, to have Iktot nnheld fJTT 6 ?

He was advised that the King could not be expected to accept (6) and (d\ while \a) and (c) might be acceptable only if Under-Secretaries were excluded. It was eventually proposed by Ali Maber Pasha, and accepted by Nahas Pasha, that the King should see the latter and give him cordial assurances for publication m the press, in return for the Prime Minister’s acceptance of Ali Maher’s appointment. Nahas Pasha would not mention his four demands, and the question whether the extraordinary session of Parliament was competent to discuss the constitutional question would be submitted to the Constitutional Committee, and Parliament would be adjourned for a week, thus giving time for further negotiations. 40. Matters were not improved by the action of the Palace organ Balagh in publishing, on the 22nd October, a distorted account of the request from His Majesty’s Embassy to the Grand Chamberlain for postponement of Ali Maher’s appointment, a request which was quite falsely attributed to urgent demands on the part of the Prime Minister. Hopes of compromise were further diminished by the attitude adopted by King Farouk when the prearranged interview with the Prime Minister took place on the 26th October. Nahas Pasha gave out to the press that he had received full assurances from the King that the appoint ment of Ali Maher Pasha was not an unfriendly action and that both Ali Maher Pasha and the King would remain above all parties and would co-operate with the Government. In actual fact, however, the King had been very rude to Nahas Pasha and had strongly insisted upon the dissolution of the Blueshirts. Nahas Pasha had concealed this from the public, but the King’s communication regarding the blueshirts was speedily divulged in the Balagh. A further complication had been created by the Palace instigation of disorders in the university with direct encouragement by the rector, Louth Sayed. Nahas Pasha, on the 25th October, telephoned to Zulhcar Pasha asking the King’s agreement for dismissing the rector. The latter resigned himself on the following day, but the disorders continued. 41. The position at the end of the month, when Sir M. Lampson returned to Egypt from leave on the 1st November, was therefore extremely confused. Ali Maher Pasha was continuing to assure His Majesty’s Embassy of his anxiety to co-operate with Nahas Pasha, but was allowing the Balagh to bedevil each fresh move for conciliation by tendencious publicity which could only come from the most inside information. Nahas Pasha and Makram Ebeid Pasha were asserting violently that their patience was completely exhausted, and that, with the help of Parliament, they could call the bluff (as they declared it to be) of the King and Ali Maher Pasha if only His Majesty’s Embassy would stand aside and keep the ring. Nahas Pasha was even talking about substituting Prince Abdel Moneim, son of the ex-Khedive, for King Farouk. d.9 Sir M Lamr&gt;son lost no time in discussing the situation with Nahas outspoken, and described King Farouk as wilfully n* 3 [17725]unconstitutional, anti-British, and even anti-foreign. Ali Maher Pasha, whom the Ambassador urged to collaborate in the endeavour to find some solution, expressed complete contempt for Nahas Pasha and his Government who e claimed, were now detested by the whole intelligentsia. Me agreed tinally, however to work for some solution, and Sir M. Lampson suggested as a general line that Nahas Pasha should be induced to drop his four demands at least temporarily, that King Farouk, on his side, should do the same in his attacks on Nahas Pasha in regard to the blueshirts, and that eventually an attempt should be made to get His Majesty and Nahas Pasha to meet and bury the hatchet. 43. On the 5th November the Ambassador had an audience of the King, which was not unsatisfactory. Sir Miles Lampson again counselled patience and restraint, and strongly advised His Majesty to seek to find a workable solution of crises. The King argued that the constitutional prerogatives of the Crown were being attacked from every side by Nahas Pasha, and he felt it his duty to protect them even if it meant dismissing Nahas Pasha and appealing to the nation. His Majesty, however, undertook to be patient and not to force the issue. 44. Subsequent to these interviews the atmosphere appeared for a time to be on the mend. Ali Maher Pasha had a long friendly talk with Nahas Pasha, both getting a good impression of the other. Parliament had reopened on the 1st November. Its proceedings were not of any particular interest except on the 10th November when Makram Pasha made a spirited reply to a question regarding exceptional promotions made by the Government. Makram Pasha produced figures to show that previous Governments had a worse record in this respect than the present Government and maintained that any exceptions made now were only to make amends for unfair treatment accorded to certain officials who had suffered persecution in the past for their political views. 45. There was renewed political activity in Cairo in the middle of November. On Independence Day, the 13th November, the Prime Minister and Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha made important political speeches to large audiences, but the day passed off quietly. The next day there were clashes between the students and blueshirts when the former visited the memorial to students killed in the 1935 disorders. On the 15th November, the King returned to Cairo from Alexandi ia and numerous demonstrations occurred of students and workmen both for and against the Government. The Minister of Interior issued a communique directly accusing the opponents of the present regime, and the Liberal Constitutionalists in particular, of instigating these disorders and declaring that the law would be rigorously enforced against them. Dr. Hussein Heikal, who had visited the university on the 14th November, takino 1, a message fiom Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha to the students, was summoned before the parquet on the charge of fomenting disorder. 40. Jrarnament was tormally reopened on the 18th November. On this occasion a few changes were made in the Cabinet. Mahmoud Bassiouni, Minister of Wakfs, was reappointed President of the Senate, and was succeeded in the TWnH 17 ° f vT Wak i fs , b ?r f r 1 T , asha Hussein - Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies. Neguib-el-Hilah Bey was appointed Minister of Education. twfl' C t . he C 1 ':!

Ali Maher Pasha p led that it was Nahas 1 asha and not the King who was behaving unconstitu- lonaliy, and if ^ alias Pasha disbanded the Blueshirts and abandoned usino- workmen for his political ends, Ali Maher Pasha would give the Ambassador his word of honour that the King would hereafter work loyally with Nahas. the 28th November an attempt was made to assassinate Nahas Pasha at Heliopolis. A Greenshirt, Izzed Din Abdul Kader, fired four shots at the Prime Minister’s car. Nahas Pasha was not injured, only one shot hitting the car. The assailant was arrested. Wafdist sympathisers subsequently demonstrated in the town, and a clash occurred outside Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha s house, from which shots were fired and a few people were injured. 51. Ihe situation between the Palace and the Government was, meanwhile, getting steadily worse. The Ambassador reported on the 28th November that an open clash seemed imminent, and discussing alternative lines of policy, namely : {a) to give full support to either Nahas Pasha or the King, or (b) to stand aside and let events take their course, expressed the opinion that the only safe policy was to maintain the attitude of friendly advice and remonstrance adopted since King Farouk’s return, and, if that failed, to leave the two parties to fight it out. 52. The Foreign Office in reply on the 30th November instructed the Ambassador to press Nahas Pasha to broaden his Cabinet and to urge King Farouk in most vigorous language to co-operate with the present Government on a broadened basis and to abandon the policy of obstruction and pin-pricks. 53. During the next few days the Prime Minister was ill in bed, but Sir M. Lampson urged upon Makram Pasha the advisability of drawing into the ranks of the Government the dissident elements of their party, especially Ahmed Maher Pasha. Makram Pasha replied that Dr. Ahmed Maher assured Nahas Pasha of complete loyalty, but refused to enter the Ministry unless Nokrashi Pasha were provided for. Makram Pasha felt that Nokrashi Pasha could not possibly be readmitted. The Ambassador also gave similar advice to Amin Osman Pasha, adding that all coloured shirt organisations, including Blueshuts, should be abolished. Amin Osman Pasha agreed, but pointed out the risk that Nahas Pasha would thereby be throwing in his chief weapon, possibly only to find that, when he was disarmed, the Palace would, by continued intrigue, deal with him at their mercy. 54 Nevertheless, on the 12th December the press published a statement by the leader of the Blueshirts ordering his followers, under instructions from ^ahas Pasha to refrain from bearing arms of any sort. This appeared to be a first step towards transforming the movement, as previously promised by Jsahas Pasha, to the proportions of an athletic association. 55 On the 17th December the Foreign Office, fearing that further delay in informing Kino Farouk of their views might encourage His Majesty to assume Iw the Aid not consider him to blame for the present dispute and that they would view with equanimity the dismissal of Nahas Pasha suggested that the would view witn equam y without waiting for Nahas Pasha’s decision Ambassador snould see y he N“Nf hk Government Sir M.

His Majesty addeTthat*if bie ’Government would meet him on outstanding issues he would bury the past and start afres . KnncHpnpd basis for Nahas Pasha’s Administration 56. Efforts to sud den crisis precipitated by a were, however, crossed on th^ ^ to ^ eilterS; i n which he stated that declaration made by ^ 1 - ^ Pahinet within a few days, and that, if possible. King Farouk would dismiss the Cab t th ^ kould be asked to form d ' “ “r/* 1 ”14 Pasha were thereby destroyed. Nevertheless negotiations for a setttement continued By the 23rd December Nahas Pasha had agreed to two of the Palace demands, namely, the dissolution of the Blueshirts and the maintenance of he Military Officers’ Oath in its existing form, but two other questions regarding the appointments of Senators and prior consultation by the Government of the Palace on all important decrees remained unsettled. 57. Meanwhile, on the 23rd December, the Wafd Executive held a meeting, at which they passed a resolution, with only the dissentient voice of Dr Ahmed Maher to the effect that no member of the Wafd should take office m the event of the dismissal of Nahas Pasha. The same evening the Wafdist Parliamentary Body passed a similar resolution by 228 votes to 3, Dr. Ahmed Maher being among the minority. 58. During the crisis demonstrations took place, mostly of an anti-Govern- ment character. Further efforts to reconcile the views of the Palace and the Government were again jeopardised when Ali Maher Pasha, professing alarm over the state of public security and for the safety of the King, ordered Hassan Rifaat, Permanent Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Interior, to take over charge of the police from Youssef-el-Guindi, the Parliamentary Under secretary of State. The issue by Ali Maher Pasha of orders to an Under secretary of State over the head of the Government did not help matters. It was, indeed, now becoming apparent that the Palace did not desire a settlement which would prolong Nahas Pasha’s tenure of office. Negotiations proceeded in a desultory fashion, but no sooner did Nahas Pasha show a disposition to agree on one point than others were brought up which further complicated the issue. 59. Finally, on the 28th December, Ali Maher Pasha presented Nahas Pasha with an entirely new proposal that all questions at issue be submitted for arbitration to a committee of elder statesmen and senior officials, and demanded an answer within twenty-four hours. As a result of Sir M. Lampson’s interven tion, the Palace agreed to give Nahas Pasha a little longer in which to reply, and Nahas Pasha, again as a result of the Ambassador’s advice, accepted the principle of arbitration, but objected to the proposed composition of the committee as overwhelmingly anti-Wafd. Makram Pasha conveyed Nahas Pasha’s decision to Ah Maher Pasha, who replied he had no mandate to discuss alternative proposals regarding the composition of the arbitral body, and regretted that the King’s proposal had been rejected. , 6 i°- next da U the 30th December, the King dismissed Nahas Pasha and charged Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha with the formation of a new Government. A decree was issued the same day appointing the following Cabinet: Mohamed Muhmoud Pasna .■ Prime Minister and Interior. Ismail Sidky Pasha : Finance. Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha : Foreign Affairs. Ahmed Mohamed Khashaba Pasha : Justice Abdel Aziz Fahmy Pasha : No portfolio Mohamed Hilmy Issa Pasha : Wakfs. Ahmed Loutfy Essayed Pasha : No portfolio Mohamed Bahieddine Barakat Bey : Education.

General CHAPTER II ' __Anglo - Egypt ian Relations after the Treaty. Trea?^f 0 ll^c^t^ x Tht r A 9 iE?A atifiCati °r nS ° f the Anglo-Egyptian High Commissioner and Wacyf Boutros GhaYTksh' feer^of FoUgn 6Affairs. The Residency thereupon automatically acquired the status of an ^mbassy and the High Commissioner became the first British Ambassador to ® Allowing day the British military guard, which had been mounted on me Residency since the declaration of the protectorate, was withdrawn and its place taken by Egyptian civil police. Prior to the treaty the High Commissioner and the Residency staff had enjoyed special privileges not accorded to diplomatic representatives. Some of these inevitably and properly lapsed on the change of regime, but, in general, it was the Ambassador’s view, which was understood to be shared by the Prime Minister, that any change which suggested a derogation of the status of the British representative should, wherever possible, be avoided. In one respect it was, in fact, possible to claim an enhancement of the position of the Ambassador over that of the High Commissioner, namely, that of precedence. Shortly after the entry into force of the treaty the head of the Protocol Depart ment of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, discussing the changes of precedence which would be necessary in view of the alteration in the Ambassador’s status, stated that the Ministry were anxious to follow British precedent as far as possible, and enquired as to the position in regard to the precedence of foreign Ambassadors in London. He was informed that in England foreign Ambassadors, as being the direct representatives of their Sovereigns, ranked next to members of the British Royal family of the rank of Royal Highness. This scale of precedence would place the Ambassador not only above members of the Egyptian Royal family who were not of the rank of Royal Highness, but also above the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who have previously ranked above the High Commissioner. This suggestion, though apparently acceptable to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, caused resentment among the princes and nabils, and it was understood that the Prime Minister had also raised objections. Towards the end of the year, however, Prince Mohamed Aly gave the Ambassador to understand that a compromise solution whereby the Ambassador would be placed after princes of the Egyptian Royal family standing within two genera tions of the Sovereign (who would be the equivalent of Royal Highnesses in England) would be acceptable. It was understood, however, that the Egyptian Government were still endeavouring to insist that the Ambassador should yield precedence to the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. 62. On the 9th August the local rank of Minister Plenipotentiary was conferred upon Mr. D. V. Kelly, C.M.G., M.C., counsellor to His Majesty’s Embassy, and Charge d’Affaires ad interim. Prior to the treaty the Acting High Commissioner had always been given precedence over all foreign heads of missions, and at a ceremony on the 15th October Mr. Kelly was accorded the same precedence, being seated above the American Minister, who was temporarily doyen of the Diplomatic Corps. It was felt that to attempt to insist on the retention of this precedence would ultimately inevitably lead to conflict with the heads of other missions, and very possibly end in a rebuff. The position was, therefore, discussed frankly by Mr. Kelly with the JYXinister for Foieign Affairs, who willingly agreed that he should be accorded precedence as Minister as from the date of his nomination—which had been communicated direct by the Secretary of State to Wacyf Boutros Ghali Pasha. He would thus naturally outrank all Charges d’Affaires, whether permanent or otherwise. As a result of this arrange ment Mr Kelly assumed the position of doyen of the Diplomatic Corps on the departure on leave of the American Minister, and this position was acquiesced in by the Japanese Minister, who had arrived and presented his letters subsequent to Mr. Kellv’s nomination. At a later ceremony, however, at which the Palace were responsible for the arrangements, Mr. Kelly was again placed above all foreign representatives, including Ministers who were senior to him. 63. Shortly after the entry into force of the treaty, the Prime Minister raised the question of the maintenance of contacts between himself and the Embassy Previous to the treaty it had always been the practice for the High Commissioner to communicate direct with the Prime Minister both officially and unofficially, except m gf^to^mmo^ rout,ne^ matters^ 'j^Vtlie view thaTm ytew oT the^lteration of the Embassy’s status, official notes from the possible touch with him, particularly in regard to matters arising out of the treaty [17725settlement He therefore, hoped that the Ambassador would continue to com municate with him, either verbally or by means of letters (not notes), m regard to points in which he, the Prime Minister, would eventually be called upon to take a decision This would avoid the possibility or his being confronted with the alternative of either overriding his Foreign Minister or one of his other colleagues, on the one hand, or taking some action which would not be agreeable to the Ambassador on the other. Matters of detail should be handled direct between Amin Osman Pasha, on behalf of the Prime Minister, and a member of the Embassy staff. Business with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs would be confined to^ purely formal correspondence in regard to the participation in conferences, &amp;c., and to minor routine matters. 64. A large number of questions arising out of the treaty were dealt with in this way between the Ambassador and the Prime Minister, either direct or through Amin Osman Pasha, including such questions as the arrangements for the establishment of the military mission, the creation of the Treaty Building Committee, the establishment of the Arbitral Board, arrangements for the liquidation of the European police, the future of the Frontiers Administration, the return of the Egyptian forces to the Sudan, &amp;c. The procedure, on the whole, worked well, though at times entailing an unconscionable strain on Amin Osman Pasha. He continued, however, to be of the highest possible value, both in regard to the above matters arising out of the treaty, and, in regard to political questions, to the oriental secretariat. His assistance during the difficult period of treaty implementation cannot be too highly appreciated. At the same time an effort was made to maintain the channel of contact between the oriental secretariat and the different Ministries, as it was realised that the presence of Amin Osman Pasha could not be relied upon indefinitely. No objection was raised to this procedure by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Defence of Egypt. 65. After the signature of the treaty it was obvious that the most vital question confronting the two new allies was that of the defence of Egypt. Hitherto the General Officer Commanding, British Troops in Egypt, had under taken full responsibility for the defence of Egypt, for which purpose he had en j C) y e( i wide powers, including the right to declare martial law. Under the treaty the responsibility of declaring martial law was specifically laid upon the Egyptian Government, and, at the same time, it was clearly brought out that the defence of Egypt was a joint obligation in which the close co-operation of the military authorities of the two countries would be essential. Under pre-treaty conditions the Egyptian army had been deliberately debarred from the use of all modern military weapons and equipment. The treaty settlement imposed an obligation upon the British Government to assist the Egyptian Government, in various'ways to reorganise and re-equip the Egyptian army. The steps taken in this direction are recorded separately under paragraphs 69-81. 66. In addition, however, it was clear that there would have to be some P,UlvZ U k® c y°P erat . lon ° f Brit ish and Egyptian General Staffs, to ft WestpPP'k ^ PU the UT e 0f E §yP t ’ with Particular reference mandiU to hPi? ffT® acc °r din g 1 y arranged for the General Officer Com manding to hold confidential conversations with the Prime Minister with a view to acquainting the Prime Minister with the main principles of the problem and endeavouring to ensure firstly, the full co-operation of the Egyptfan mUitarv pSe to’caTrvourthelU ^e required to be taken to make it tefoPAhrPHU Mtois d to,V C r f yP S S T/ al sueh conversations took place ucioie me rnme Minister s departure for Montreux as a pacuH the Prime Mim'stpr nnri *-■ ' , A as decided that before discussions with ^ious ?,^ could be continued on a Station, the General Officer V mnrnandina- e T .^° m ! n ^ 1 ^ er ' m ; c h ie f, Mediterranean Officer Commanding, Roval Air Force Mtodiyp 1 1°°^ T Egypt ’ and the Air obtain agreement among themitoesTn’in! dd East ,’ s i loul , d meet together and Arrangements were accordingly made fo^meetlnnsof kUf! 16 &lt; ! efe ? ce of E gypt- to take place when the Commander-in-chief paid Ms InnuaUisR tlTexa^Sm October. As a result of these discussions, at which a member of the Embassy , a , v ?^ eSe ? t o aS observer ’ a defence scheme was drawn up and submitted o tne omets of btatt for approval, it being understood that, in view of the risk cv leakage, a much abridged version would have to be produced for submission to ke Egyptian Government. At the same time, in view of the greatly increased Italian reinforcements in Libya and the general international tension, the three local commanders made recommendations for the immediate despatch of certain reinforcements. These recommendations were stronglv endorsed by the Ambassador, to whom, on his return f rom leave, the Prime Minister had expressed deep anxiety regarding the security of Egypt from a possible attack from Libya. The Ambassador, while recognising that the programme for home defence in England imposed certain limitations on the means available for the defence of EgypL urged that complete self-sufficiency in the matter of the defence of Egypt was the ideal to be aimed at. These representations resulted in the agreement of the British authorities to send out certain of the reinforcements asked for. 67. At the same time steps were taken to improve the local defence situation by the despatch of an Egyptian battalion to Mersa Matruh to repair the existing defences; the loan by the British Admiralty of coastal defence guns for Alexandria; the improvement of the existing system of patrols along the Libyan border by the Frontiers Light Car Patrols, which it was arranged should be more than doubled in number, and the preparation of a scheme for air observation posts in the Western Desert and along the coast for use in the event of hostilities. The Prime Minister showed the utmost willingness to carry out the recommendations of the British military authorities in regard to these and many other matters, and was evidently much gratified with the seriousness in which His Majesty’s Govern ment were tackling the problem. 68. The comments of the Chiefs of Staff on the local commanders’ plan had not been received by the end of the year. Reorganisation of Egyptian A rmy. 69. The nucleus of the military mission, under Major-General J. H. Marshall-Cornwall, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C., arrived in Egypt on the 13th January, 1937. Within a year of its arrival it had grown (including the air force wing) to a strength of thirty officers and twenty warrant officeis and non-commissioned officers, and a good start had been made with the reorganisation and rearmament of the Egyptian army. 70 At the outset of its activities a slight hitch occurred; the chief of the mission had been asked by the War Office in London to take over from the former Inspector-General’s staff five British officers who had been specially selected by the War Office for instructional duties. Four of these officers were ready to join the mission but the Egyptian Government refused to retain their services on the ground that they had enjoyed executive authority over Egyptian troops under the old regime. ' The chief of the mission, realising that a mattei of P olltl £al prestige was involved, and after consultation with the Ambassador^ accepted t his decision and it was agreed that no officers who had served m the Egyptian army n . It was at first ^^“n^gypT be assimilated to the Bntish to . • di ^ of the Egyptian courts.

This was accepted by the Prime Minister and the agreement was embodied in an exchange of notes. 72, The mission began by a thorough investigation of the existing state of the Egyptian army, and every unit and military establishment was in turn visited and inspected. It was found that both armament and tactical training weie of a primitive nature, while neither the organisation noi distribution of the army was inspired by any coherent strategic conception or purpose. T he three infantry brigades had neither heavy nor light machine guns, anti-tank weapons or mortars ; the cavalry consisted of two mounted squadrons, equally unequipped with automatic weapons, while the artillery was composed of only four pack batteries, two of which were dispersed in frontier outposts at Solium and El Arish. Engineers and mechanical transport were practically non-existent, while there were no signal units, tanks, wireless or anti-aircraft weapons. Apart from this defective state of affairs, the five-year conscript recruiting system provided neither an effective reserve nor an efficient professional army; the non-commis sioned officers were mostly illiterate, and no adequate mobilisation arrangements existed. The Egyptian army lacked educational establishments either for the higher training of officers or for the technical instruction of the various arms. 73. Further, it was found that, in the event of war, all the nine battalions of the Egyptian army would be required to guard the vital and vulnerable lines of communication of the British troops in Egypt, and no force would therefore be available for mobile operations except two horsed cavalry squadrons and four pack batteries. Faced with this situation, the military mission had to recast the whole strategic role and tactical doctrine of the army, besides reorganising and rearming it on modern lines and converting it to a mechanised basis. A staff school, an artillery school, an engineer school, and a maintenance school had to be created from zero, and establishments had to be drawn up for the large number of new units to be formed. Still more arduous was the task of compiling detailed lists of weapons, equipment, stores and ammunition to be ordered from England for all units and training establishments. 74. Within a year of the mission’s arrival the following new units had been trained, armed and added to the Egyptian army :— 1 rifle battalion, 2 machine-gun battalions, 4 field batteries, 1 medium battery, 1 anti-aircraft battery, 1 engineer company. 75. ot the great difficulties confronting the mission was that of obtaining from the United Kingdom the armaments required for the re-equip ment of the Egyptian army. Owing to the rearmament of the British army and the state of the British munitions industry, many new weapons were still in the expenmental stage and not yet in production, while those actually in production were already allotted to meet British requirements. Great pressure was brought to jeai on the war Office by the military mission and by the Embassy and the Foreign ce, and, as a result, the difficulty was largely overcome by the War Office agreeing to release a certain number of weapons, such as field-guns, Vickers and ewis guns, from the war reserve stocks of the British army for transfer to the gypUan army. At the same time the Egyptian army was promised a quota of the new weapons now being manufactured. eaiiJLnt T rL!, nability t °k th ?

This material has enabled training to be started on a sound basis in all arms of the service, and a satisfactory commencement has been made with all forms of training at the new schools of instruction, including a most valuable tactical course for senior Egyptian officers at the Staff School. 79. The dilatory methods and inefficient administrative organisation of the Egyptian War Ministry have greatly retarded progress both in reorganisation and rearmament, but a noticeable improvement was effected by the energetic new War Minister, Hamdi Seif-el-Nasr Pasha, who succeeded Ali Fahrny Pasha at the beginning of August. 80. Steady progress has also been made with the expansion programme of the Egyptian Army Air Force. 81. On the advice of the chief of the military mission, the Egyptian Govern ment decided to erect munitions factories in Egypt lor the manufacture of explosives and the assembling and filling of munitions. The chief of the military mission recommended that these factories should be a State concein, but tnat their erection, organisation and initial working should be entrusted to Imperial Chemical Industries. The Minister of War stated that, while he was prepared to agree that only British firms should be employed m the erection of these factories the contracts would have to be put out to tender, except in so far as there was only one British firm capable of carrying out the work. In practice this means that the three explosives factories will have to be erected and organised by Imperial Chemical Industries, who would thereby also be in a favourable position for competing for the tender for the assembling and filling factoiy, and Ft was an^nged for a representative of the Imperial Chemical Industries, who walon his way back froi/South Africa, to meet the Minister of War. Building Committee. _ ^ + i Shortly after the new year, the Prime Minister urged that early step ,, 'i , i Jir. TYt'Avidp for the appointment of members of the committee should be ta h e r n n ^ r hhpb 5 of the annS to article 8 of the treaty, the building l°f 7b7tvFXand otCF accommodation in the Canal Zone was to be entrust^ member ana a civilian me “ De y , : ting for f orma l purposes, through the His Majesty s Government, c °“ . • . ^’ atters were t o be sent to them direct &gt;. m. ** *. **-•*&lt;*•—f t j, e progress of the committee at work and warn him of the possibility of disnutes so as to enable his Excellency to advise whether the moment had arrived when a matter should be referred to the Arbitral Board or whether any modifica tion of the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government was advisable. 83 Brigadier C. T. Tomes, D.S.O., M.C., Brigadier-in-Charge of Adminis tration, Headquarters, British Troops in Egypt, was m due course appointed military member and, by virtue of his seniority, was treated as head of the Bn is section.^ Brigadier H. N. North, D.S.O., M.C., was appointed technical member. After protracted correspondence between the Foreign O&amp;ce and War Office, Mr C R Bawden, M.B.E., previously Inspector, State Buildings Administration, Egyptian Ministry of Public Works, was appointed civilian member. In June Squadron Leader E. P. Mackay, a member of the Air Staff Royal Air Force Middle East, was added to the British section as the representative of the Royal Air Force. 84 The committee held its first meeting on the 5th May under the presidency of Abdel Meguid Ibrahim Pasha, Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Public Works head of the Egyptian section. Weekly meetings were held until the end of July, when the committee went into recess for two months. Before doing so, the British section were able to submit to the Egyptian section informally a preliminary block plan of the military area at Geneifa, together with an explanatory note and schedule of buildings. 85. A number of sub-committees dealing with such matters as anti-malarial measures, horticultural arrangements, drainage projects, &amp;c., also carried out a certain amount of preliminary work. Relations between the British and Egyptian sections were generally most amicable, but considerable delays were occasioned owing to the character of the Egyptian delegation, who, being all officials, were much preoccupied with other duties and also were not in a position to accept responsibility for decisions. Delays were also occasioned owing to the necessity for constant references to the Foreign Office, War Office and the Treasury in regard to matters both of principle and technical detail. 86. After the resumption of work in September, further weekly meetings were held until the end of the year. The most important development was the demand of the Egyptian section for details of all the accommodation required in connexion with the building of barracks, so as to enable a complete estimate to be prepared. The Foreign Office were advised accordingly and asked to take steps to expedite the submission of all British requirements, including the accommoda tion at the new Royal Air Force stations in the Canal Zone and the amenities to be provided under the treaty. Construction of Treaty Roads and Railways. 87. No provision was made in the treaty for ensuring that the roads and railways, to be constructed in accordance with the annex to article 8 of the treaty, should comply with the standards specified therein. As, however, the treaty provided that these roads and railways must be constructed to the satisfaction of both parties, it appeared to be essential that a technical British official should be given access to the plans and specifications and enabled to keep in touch with the progress of the work. It was suggested to the Prime Minister that Brigadier North, the technical member of the British section of the Building Committee, should be entrusted with this task. In the first instance objections were raised by Nokrashi Pasha, the Minister of Communications, but when it was made clear that there was no question of appointing a new authority not provided by the treaty, but that the matter was simply one of practical convenience, Nokrashi Pasha agreed to accept the proposal as an informal arrangement and Brigadier North was duly put into touch with him. On Nokrashi Pasha’s replacement by Zaki-el-Orabi Pasha, similar arrangements were made for co-operation with Brigadier North. t Duong the year work was commenced on the Ismailia-Cairo and Ismaiiia-Alexandria Roads, contracts being given for the construction of the section between Ismaiiia and Tel-el-Kebir, and Tel-el-Kebir and Zagazig. The &gt;_i i Bar ram Mersa Matruh-Fuka road was completed, and, at the request of the British military authorities provision was made for the completion of all the sec ion e ween Fuka and Alexandria. An arrangement was reached between the21 Egyptian Government and the Suez Canal Company whereby instead of the latter Brft sh mShaTV 0 '' 1 betWeen P , 0rt Satd Ld'sut r/atlabklr^uL^f to the exoenTes nf y h 0r h e fv, an entlrel y independent road should be constructed, agreed mfnute to the treaty^ C ° mpany would “'tribute (see paragraph 8 in the AmtnOsm 1 ^ enq f lrie ? ^ ere “ad 6 by the Egyptian Government through to a 'r?e ?A , P l- 0 whetl ’ 1 er H' 8 Majesty’s Government would be prepared m odification m the treaty provisions for the construction of the Ismama Aiexandria road so as to run from Zagazig to Tanta via Benha instead n i ’ aS t 1 he cons t^ction of a bridge at the latter place would entail an additional expenditure of £300,000. After consultation with the General Officer Commanding and the War Office, the Egyptian Government were informed that this proposal could not be accepted, as it was regarded as essential that an alternative road across the Nile should be provided at Zifta. A suggestion was also made that the provision in paragraph 6 (B) (ii) of the annex to article 8 of the treaty, for the doubling of the railway line between Zagazig and Tanta should be abandoned in exchange for the construction of a double line from Cairo to Alexandria west of the Nile, which would reduce the dangers of the present bottle-neck at Kafr-el-Zayat. This proposal was accepted by the Whr Office, and Amin Osman Pasha was informed that if it were put forward it would receive favourable consideration. No formal approach by the Egyptian Government had, however, been made in the matter by the end of the year. Financial and Judicial Advisers. 90. In a minute of a meeting held during the course of the treaty negotia tions on the 10th August, 1936, the Prime Minister made an oral declaration, with which the High Commissioner expressed agreement, to the effect that the Egyptian Government were free from any obligation of an international character regarding the retention of the services of the financial and judicial advisers. Sir Frank Watson and Sir Arthur Booth accordingly gave formal notice to terminate their contracts of service on the 23rd June, 1937, six months after the date of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty. 91. Owing to ill-health Sir Arthur Booth was unable to collaborate with the Egyptian Government at the Montreux Conference for the abolition of the Capitulations. His place was taken by Mr. E. F. Besly, who, on the abolition of the judicial adviser’s office, joined the staff of His Majesty’s Embassy as legal adviser, with the rank of counsellor. European Department, Ministry of the Interior. 92. As a result of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, the European Department in the Ministry of the Interior, Cairo, was abolished in January 1937. It was realised, however, that it would be essential in the inteiests of both the United Kingdom and Egyptian Governments to have close liaison and interchange of information between the Ministry of the Interior and His Majesty’s Embassy concerning Italian, Communist and other subversive activities, and also m regard to foreign undesirables in general. 93 An undertaking was therefore reached on this point, and since Pie closing' down of the European Department the oriental secretariat of His Majesty’s Embassy has been in regular touch with the Egyptian Public Securi y Department and Police on matters pertaining to local intelligence, particularly those affecting internal public security. 94. Arrangements were also made whereby the oriental secretariat would deal with all correspondence emanating from the Intelligence Depaitment, Government of India, which had hitherto been exchanged with, and acted upon, by the European Department. SB'S. '#&amp;&amp;&amp; - -'3 Suez will remain under the command of British ofhceis. [17725] E # 496 At the date on which the treaty was ratified, i.e., the 22nd December, 1936 there were sixty-two European officer posts and 338 European constable oosts and with the exception of two British officers who were permanent officials, the whole of this personnel was employed on contracts which expired not later than the 31st May, 1937. 97. It was deemed desirable for administrative and other purposes that the contracts to be issued to those European police officials icmaining in the service of the Egyptian Government after 1937 should terminate on the 31st May in the year selected for their retirement, and not the 22nd December, except in the last year of the five-year period. 98. Furthermore, it was agreed with the Egyptian Government that, for financial and other reasons, a proportion greater than one-fifth of the constables should be eliminated in the first batch in 1937. The total number of British police officers and constables who left the service of the Egyptian Government in 1937 was 11 officers and 81 constables, of whom 2 officers and 22 constables retired voluntarily. 99. The remainder of the European members have been divided into yearly batches for the purpose of elimination, and a special form of contract was drawn up by His Majesty’s Embassy and approved by the Egyptian Government for issue to the officers and constables concerned. 100. Arrangements were also made with the Egyptian Government for all officers and constables not previously compensated under Law 28 of 1923 to be accorded special financial treatment on retirement, in the form of a gratuity and a repatriation allowance. 101. Every assistance has been given by His Majesty’s Government and non-official organisations both in England and in Egypt to retiring officers and constables in their search for fresh employment, and, as regards the British members of the Egyptian police who retired in 1937, the position as at the 31st December was as follows:— ^ (y OTlStCLuLBS.

With the object of assisting financially those officers and men of British nationality who on retirement from the Egyptian police, had difficulty m finding employment the sum of £6,000 was voted by Parliament in the United rEatn 11 aS . a be . nevolent f und to be administered by a committee in England, of EnrnnZ th ' s &gt; f me /uuds were publicly subscribed in Egypt for the benefit hv fiE? th» ® onstab es of the Egyptian city police forces.

Exchange of Notes on Telecommunications and Pensions of Retired Foreign JJ LCICLLS, 106. As recorded in paragraph 60 of the annual report for 1936, a confidential exchange of notes took place at the time of the treaty negotiations m regard to (a) an agreement to the effect that telecommunications to or from or m Egypt should remain in the hands of exclusively Egyptian or British or Anglo- Egyptian concerns, and (b) that no additional tax should be levied on the pensions of retired foreign officials in Egyptian Government service, or foreign officials who had qualified for pensions. This exchange of notes did not form part of the treaty settlement and, at the request of Nahas Pasha, it was agreed that, for reasons of internal politics, it should not be made public for the time being. In February 1937 the Ambassador drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that it was the intention of the British Government to register the notes with the League of Nations, and as that act, which could not be delayed indefinitely, would naturally imply publication, to express the hope that the Prime Minister would concur in this procedure. The Prime Minister, however, urged most strongly that publication should be still further delayed so as not to add to the difficulties with which he was faced owing to the intensive campaign of intrigue against him. Despite the fact that further pressure, both in Cairo and Montreux, was brought to bear upon Nahas Pasha to agree to registration and publication, the Prime Minister continued to raise objections. It was not until he had been informed, on the instructions of the Secretary of State, that the British Govern ment felt bound, to their great regret, to register and publish these notes even against the Prime Minister’s wishes, that he agreed to their registration and publication after the conclusion of the Assembly in September. Status of British Officials. 107. As reported in paragraph 61 of the 1936 annual report, an assurance was obtained from Nahas Pasha during the course of the treaty negotiations that the unwritten understanding that the three months’ notice clause in the contracts of foreign officials would not be invoked except in cases of grave mis conduct, would still hold good, and that officials then serving would be retained until their contracts expired. The only exceptions were to be the staffs of the financial and judicial advisers, the Director-General European Department, and the British officers and non-commissioned officers in the Egyptian army. 108 Early in January 1937 Mr. W. T. Briggs, the chief electrical engineer to the Egyptian State Railways, informed the Ambassador that though his contract was not due to expire until the 31st May, 1938, Trihe ment had decided to dispense with his services as from May 1937, under the three months’ notice clause of his contract. The matter was at once taken up with the Egyptian authorities, and it transpired that the decision was due to the personal initiative of Nokrashi Pasha, Minister of Communications The latter adduced various reasons to justify his action, but it was, in fact, ascertained tha ' hfs decision to get rid of Mr. Briggs dated back to his previous tenure of office as Minister of Communications in 1930, when he had received^complaints o Mr-Rrie-es’s treatment of his junior Egyptian employees. The matter was taken up’strongly with the Prime Minister by the Ambassador, but, as Nokrashi taken ”P .'c; vi „ lr i „ deadlock ensued, and at one time it seemed possible fbTt LklshfpX might ^ this’issue. After protracted negotiations that . Pasha however a compromise was arrived at whereby the Ek°ptfan S^ve?— whfle temniating mT Briggs's services, undertook to LgyP n n T -. PT .i nr ] of bis contract. Jhis solution was accepted by II s Mlje h sty’s f Government as not giving away the principle involved and as affording a satisfactory precede ^ learne d from Mr. Butcher, Director-General, lO 0 . In th .® “he Ministry of Public Works, that Osman Moharrem PashaCommissioner to Nahas Pasha on the 12th August 1936 which formed part of X treaty settlement, it was implied that this official should henceforth be an Eoyptian) Major Newhouse’s contract did not terminate until the 31st May, 1939 Xt it was made clear by the Minister of Public Works that unless he were to facilitate matters by resigning of his own accord he would be given notice of the termination of his contract under the three months notice clause. The matter was at once taken up by the Ambassador with the Prime Minister, who replied that there was no question whatever of evading the undertaking not to invoke the three months’ notice clause. He drew attention, however, to the understanding under the treaty that the Egyptian representative of irrigation in the Sudan should in future be an Egyptian, and stated that in order to secure this Major Newhouse must be transferred. Nahas Pasha agreed that he should be found employment until the expiration of his contract, but Major Newhouse ultimately decided that, rather than remain in Egypt under the above conditions, which might prove to be embarrassing, he would prefer to resign and find other occupation elsewhere. In the circumstances it was not felt possible to press him not to do so. Frontiers A dministration. 110. In the previous treaty negotiations no attempt had ever been made to regulate the future of the Frontiers Administration. In spite, therefore, of the immensely enhanced importance of the question of the defence of Egypt’s frontiers as a result of the alteration of the strategic position in the Mediter ranean after the Italo-Abyssinian War and the stationing of a large permanent Italian garrison in Libya, it was not possible to introduce this question into the 1936 conversations. After the treaty came into force, however, it was at once apparent that this question would have to be taken up, and the matter was almost immediately brought to a head by the decision of the Egyptian Government not to renew the contract of Green Bey as Governor of the Western Desert. At the same time the Egyptian Government decided not to renew the contract of Bather Bey as second-in-command, Frontiers Administration Forces, and Bimbashi, Thompson, as Officer Commanding Light Car Patrols, Western Desert. Con currently there was an agitation in the press for the replacement of Hamersley Bey, the Governor of Sinai Province, by an Egyptian. It was apparent, there fore, that, at the best, the Frontiers Administration was gradually being denuded of its few remaining British civilian and military officials as their contracts fell in; and that, at the worst, we might be faced with a sudden demand by the Egyptian Government for the removal of all the British officials in the admini stration. It was held that the latter proposal could, in fact, be rejected on the grounds of Nahas Pasha’s undertaking at the time of the signature of the treaty k° a PPty th® three months’ notice clause in the contracts of British civilian officials, except those whose retirement was contemplated in the treaty. In this connexion it should be noted that the Frontiers Administration Forces were not regarded as part of the Egyptian army. 111. The matter formed the subject of lengthy discussions with the British military authorities, the chief of the military mission, and the British Officer omman mg the Frontiers Administration Forces. Although it was agreed that th e ideal arrangement would be to secure the maintenance of the existing n tiX’ 1 , w '? s that, short of an actual emergency, this was out of the fEnPo ® ubse l uentl y&gt; Proposals were eventually discussed, first with Amin mem oAt, B h 9Qrt d T SeCOnd y ^ lth ‘i 16 k lme Mil pster, which resulted in an agree- June providing for the following arrangements :— (!)

As a result of negotiations which took place between the Egyptian Government and the Imperial War Graves Commission in December 1936, a War Graves Agreement between the Egyptian Government and the Governments of the British Commonwealth represented on the commission (viz., His Maiestv’s Governments in Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, and the Government of India) was signed by the Ambassador and Mahmoud Ghaleb Pasha, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the 6th June, 1937. 114. This agreement was of a similar character to that concluded with France, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Iraq and to the Anglo-German-French War Graves Agreement. 115. To facilitate the working of the agreement and to deal with adminis trative and other questions concerning the monuments and cemeteries in Egypt, an Anglo-Egyptian War Cemeteries Committee was subsequently set up consisting of an equal number of British and Egyptian representatives. These were as follows :— British. Honorary members— His Majesty’s Ambassador. The General Officer Commanding, British Troops in Egypt. Egyptian. Honorary members— Tewfik Nessim Pasha. Mahmoud Shukri Pasha. Members— The Air Officer Commanding, Middle East Sir Robert Greg. Sir Henry Barker. Sir Fabian Ware. Members— The Under-Secretaries of State, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Public Works. Chapter III.— Relations with Other Countries. (A) General. League of Nations. 116 In article 3 of the Treaty of Alliance His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had promised to support a request by the Egyptian Government for membership of the League, and even before the end of 1936 the question of procedure was under discussion between the two Governments Egypt was anxious to be admitted to membership before the ordinary meeting of the Assemb y in September 1937 and an extraordinary session of the League Assembly some tune in the spring was therefore contemplated. She was anxious also to be invited to aDDlv ^membership in much the same way as had been done in the case of Turkey With a view to securing these invitations, she herself chose to approach the Moslem States members of the League direct, namely, Afghanistan, Iraq Persia and Turkey, and asked that His Majesty’s Government would approach other States. 117 His Majesty’s Government accordingly m February addressed the the Secretary-General of the League simultaneously of the action which they were taking. His Majesty’s Government’s own invitation^ to the [17725]Egyptian Government was sent in a note of the 19th February, which promised support in accordance with the treaty. This invitation was quickly followed by invitcitions from His ]Vf£ijGsty s Govommonts in Ngw ZonmnQ,^ ooutn Airies, cind Australia and the Government of India. His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom further suggested in a note to the Secretary-General of the League on the 11th March that a suitable date for a special session of the Assembly might be about the time of the meeting of the League Council in May, it being anticipated that the Montreux Conference would be at that time either concluded or far advanced. 118. The French Government when approached by His Majesty’s Govern ment showed a tendency to link up the matter of Egypt’s entry into the League with the satisfactory conclusion of the Capitulations negotiations and to require in advance certain assurances from Egypt regarding, for example, the protection of foreigners. In subsequent conversations, however, between the British Embassy in Paris and the Quai d’Orsay the French disclaimed any intention to make conditions, but evidently feared an attempt by Egypt to abolish Capitula tions unilaterally and were therefore reluctant to commit themselves. The hesitation was, however, only temporary and the French Government issued an invitation to Egypt on the 4th March. 119. His Majesty’s Government had reason to fear that, in addition to the general declaration of readiness to observe international undertakings which applications for membership of the League usually include, certain members of the Assembly might attempt to stipulate that Egypt should give special guarantees on the lines of those which had been required of other States such as Iraq, for example, as regards the treatment of minorities. His Majesty’s Government therefore suggested that Egypt should volunteer a suitable declara tion, thereby forestalling excessive demands and discussion. His Majesty’s Government did no consider desirable any comprehensive or detailed declaration such as missionary interests were pressing for, since this might only create a minority question or, in so far as one existed already, intensify it. They suggested instead that the declaration should take the form of drawing attention to and reaffirming certain articles in the Egyptian Constitution regarding liberty of opinion and worship. Nahas Pasha was not opposed to the idea of such an assurance. But subsequent discussion during the Montreux Conference showed that he had counted without some of his colleao'ues and that, th^rA wa« a -Pnnrla- g-ujuui nuns.t 27 4S] Abolition of Capitulations. A Inimediately after the signature, on the 26th Aunust 19S6 of tt&gt;p advf^s S o§ice n to m«k y ’ th&lt; ; ba f y . began ’ ■“ collal » I 'ation ,:, with the ’judicial Mviser s olhce, to make a study of the questions raised by the promise of His Powerffor^I^hTf to r’i? p0 t t her approach' to the Capitulatory the ved i! 1 abolition of the Capitulations by consent. By the beginning of ?? 5 Pifparatory work had so far advanced that it was possible to invite i]ndor g iSipt^i^°^ e fr m f nt + tC&gt; C °^ lder i the ^ oint P lan of cam paign contemplated ndei article 13 of the treaty. That these preliminary negotiations were success- iy undertaken and a resulting agreement arrived at which was largely instrumental m bringing about the eventual success of the Montreux Conference, is due to a degree impossible to exaggerate, to the help which was given by Mr. W. T. Beckett, the second legal adviser to the Foreign Office, who was sent out to assist, and who arrived in Egypt on the 13th January. Beckett stayed in Egypt for just under a month. During this time he and Mr. Kelly were in daily touch with Bedawi Pasha and Mr. Besly, the acting judicial adviser at that time, who had been appointed by the Egyptian Government to take part in the technical discussions. At first, 'Bedawi Pasha showed a strong inclination to oppose the grant of the safeguards insisted upon by His Majesty’s Government as the conditions on which alone their full support could be given to the demands of the Egyptian Government, but this opposition was overcome, partly by erosion and partly by reference on important points to the superior authority of the Council of Ministers, which was always approach able through the conciliatory medium of Makram Pasha. Eventually a series of heads of agreement on all matters to which His Majesty’s Government attached importance was arrived at and initialled on behalf of both Governments. The document so initialled became known and is hereinafter referred to as Document (A). 123. It was, however, clearly understood (and this point became of considerable importance at Montreux with reference to the non-inclusion in the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts of companies formed after the 15th October) that the Egyptian Government did not undertake by initialling Document (A) to include all its provisions in the convention. Document (A) prescribed the limits of concession to which the Egyptian Government must go in order to meet the demands of the other Capitulatory Powers if they were to enjoy the full support of His Majesty’s Government. They were not bound to go beyond such limits. 124. During the preliminary negotiations, the procedure to be adopted in approaching the other Governments concerned was also discussed and agreed upon. It was decided that the Egyptian Government should invite all the Capitulatory Powers to send representatives to a conference to be held at Montreux in April, and that the invitations should be conveyed in a document (known as Document (B)) which should set out the Egyptian proposals for the abolition of the capitulations and the establishment of a new legislative and judicial regime in Egypt, without mentioning the concessions which they were, in fact, prepared to make, and thus leaving the necessary margin for bargaining at the conference. These invitations were sent out on the 3rd February addressed to the diplomatic representatives in Egypt of all the Capitulatory Powers, to be communicated by them to their Governments. Although other Powers which enjoyed at the time Mixed Courts jurisdiction did not receive this invitation, the Egyptian Government stated in Document (B) that, during the transition period,'the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts would be extended to eight States other than the Capitulatory Powers, viz., Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzer land, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Roumania and Yugoslavia. This was m accordance with the promise in Document (A). 125. At the Montreux Conference in April Mr. Kelly was a member of the British delegation, and Mr. Besly, acting judicial adviser, was attached to the Egyptian delegation in an advisory capacity. The proceedings are fully recorded in’ Captain Euan Wallace’s report to the Secretary of State (Foreign Office confidential print, “ Egypt and Sudan,” Section I, June 11, 1937) and the results are embodied in the convention with its annexed protocol, declaration and exchanges of letters, and in the new “ Reglement d’Organisation judiciaire ” of [17725] r * 328 the Mixed Courts. Save for the exclusion from the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts of foreign companies incorporated after the 15th October, which is fully deTtwith m paragraphs 103 and 104 of Captain Euan ^ safegimrds and guara^ foreigners which the Egyptian Government had agreed with His Majesty’s Government m Document (A) to concede, were included in the final document with one single exception, lor this reason no detailed summary of Document (A) has been made in this report. Ihe exception referred to is the establishment of a special regime to be applied to foreigners m gyptian orisons. In spite of persistent pressure before and at Montreux,^ the Egyptian delegation found itself unable to prepare a new draft ‘ ‘ reglement to be agreed with the British delegation in time to be submitted to the conference. Makram Pasha however, gave the fullest oral assurances to Captain Euan jWEllace and Mr. Kelly, that, before modifying the present “reglement” providing special privileged* treatment for persons detained or condemned by the Mixed Courts, the Egyptian Government would consult with His Majesty’s Government on the subject of the future arrangements to be made. 126. On his return to Egypt in August Mr. Kelly reminded Makram Pasha of his promise and received a further verbal assurance that it would be kept. Nothing was done in the matter before the 15th October, but immediately after that date a committee was appointed, under the chairmanship of Hassan Bey Rifaat, the Under-Secretary of State of the Interior, to study the question of the future regime for foreign prisoners, and to formulate draft regulations. Mr. E. G. Payne, the new British avocat-general, was appointed to this committee, which met several times before the fall of the Nahas Government and, with a few exceptions, showed themselves ready to study, if not immediately to accept, the principle of creating a special class with special treatment for prisoners whose habits of life entitled them to it, i.e., all Europeans and the better-class Egyptians. By the end of the year, however, the committee had not got beyond the stage of examining the legislation of other countries on this question of discrimination amongst prisoners. 127. By a series of decree laws dated the 11th October, the Egyptian Government promulgated the necessary legislation to bring the Montreux Conven tion into force on the 15th October. This legislation included the reorganisation of the Native Courts to meet their enlarged jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, as well as the extension of the jurisdiction of Egyptian courts in matters of personal status over foreigners in certain cases. The judicial machine was therefore ready to work under the new regime when, on the 15th October, the Montreux Convention, having been ratified by Great Britain, Egypt, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Sweden and Denmark, came into force in accordance with article 15. n • 1 - 28 i,, T1 ^ e two new codes ’ viz ’ “ Cod e Penal” and “Code d’Instruction Crimmel, also came into operation on the 15th October. These showed certain changes from the codes of which copies had been given to the delegates at ontreux m accordance with Document (A), the Egyptian Government stating that mistakes resulting from their hurried preparations had had to be put right Ihe legal counsellor is submitting a separate report on these changes. 1 'rw i Th6 com Pf Sltl0n . of the Mixed Courts of first instance on the 15th October was sixty-one judges: forty-one foreign and twenty Egyptian in te !™ S article 3 of the “ Reglement d’O^Lsation (L , ' . urm § September, however, it was realised that these figures were fir t instance cZTs tT^ ^ ^ ° f forei S n J ud 8' es at that in the st instance couits The mistake was that of the Eo-yptian deleo-atiou and me S nfoI a th*e at newfofeL e n ag H eed ^ “ r ¥—” involved the appoint iudges and three EevntLnhfl? j 1 '!

By creating before the 15th October the two new posts in the court of appeal, which were authorised but not enjoined m article 2 of the £ ‘ Reglement d’Organisation judiciaire,” the Egyptian Government were able to promote a foreign judge of first instance to the new foreign post m the court of appeal and so to produce an additional vacancy for the appointment of a new foreign judge of first instance without upsetting the Montreux figures. 130 .- In making all these new appointments, while not asking officially for the advice of His Majesty’s Government, the Minister of Justice kept Mr. Besly fully informed of his intentions and seemed anxious to have his personal approval. Ihe posts were filled as follows : France got the new post in the court of appeal^ and the new posts in first instance were given to Italy, Greece, Belgium and Hungary. 131. The promise of the Egyptian Government, under item 4 of their declaration at Montreux, that they would set up an administrative advisory committee to consider cases of deportation of foreigners who had resided in Egypt for five years and over, has not yet been implemented. No cases of this sort had arisen before the end of the year. 132. Between the 15th October and the end of the year no further instru ments of ratification were deposited. In particular, the French Government, as anticipated, found themselves unable to ratify so soon, and the Egyptian Govern ment became faced in November with the awkward situation, which had been foreseen at Montreux, but which it was hoped would not arise in practical form, of a French subject committing a criminal offence and there being no court in Egypt competent to try him. The case was one of illegal traffic in drugs. The arrested man was brought before the Mixed Courts where the juge d’instruction, an Egyptian, refused to examine or detain him. The Minister of Justice and the President of the Mixed Courts very ingeniously arranged for a French juge d’instruction to take over the case and to proceed with the preliminary examina tion which, it is hoped, will be successfully protracted until France ratifies. The French Minister has been in the closest touch with the Egyptian Government over the matter, and appears to be ready and anxious to acquiesce in this ‘ £ ruse and to help the Government in every way to get round any difficulties which may arise from the inevitable delay in ratification. Quarantine Board. 133. The Quarantine Board has existed since 1831, but, in its modern form, really dates from the Venice Conference of 1892, supplemented by succeeding conferences ending with that of 1926. In August 1936 Nahas Pasha, in connexion with the renewal of the French Inspector-General’s contract, stated his intention to abolish the Quarantine Board altogether in the near future. He was urged to go slow and, during his visit to London for the signature of the treaty, agreed, through Amin Osman Pasha, to take no decision until Sir Miles Lampson’s return to Egypt. 134. On the 21st January, during the discussions preliminary to the Montreux Conference with Mr. Beckett in Cairo, Bedawi Pasha raised the question, stating that the Quarantine Board would be involved in the abolition of the Capitulations since it owed its origin to the inability of Egypt to levy taxes on foreigners without the consent of the capitulatory Powers. Although a similar view had been expressed by the judicial adviser, Sir Arthur Booth, Bedawi Pasha was informed that the board as a whole, coupled with all the decrees creating it, formed part of the International Sanitary Convention and reposed on a contractual basis with all the other parties to this convention. 135 After certain inter-departmental meetings in London, Dr. Morgan of the Ministry of Health, visited Cairo during the month of March and had discussions with the Embassy and Major Gilmour of the Quarantine Boar(i The Egyptian delegation did not raise the question during the Montreux Conference, but Nahas Pasha and Makram Pasha did so on their subsequent visit , T in tUp month of May. They were told that the board could not be abolished by the Egyptian Government without a breach of the 1926 SanitaryConvention, but that His Majesty’s Government hoped shortly to reach definite conclusions on the subject, which would be communicated to them. On his return to Cairo, Nahas Pasha pressed His Majesty’s Ambassador for early discussions in Egvpt with Dr. Morgan and the Embassy, but finally agreed to defer these discussions until the end of the year. Makram Pasha and Nahas Pasha raised the subject again with the Charge d’Affaires m October and agreed with the suggestions as regards the correct procedure to adopt which had been evolved during the various discussions between departments m London and the Embassy and Dr. Morgan in March. These were that the Egyptian Government should eventually inform the French Government, as the depository of the International Sanitary Convention, of their intention to negotiate a revision of the convention as far as this would be necessary for the abolition of the Quarantine Board, and would suggest that the negotiations be limited to the lepi csentatives of the Powers practically interested, the task to be entrusted to repi esentatives of these Powers at the International Health Office, Paris. The Egyptian Government would submit to a committee of the Paris Office a set of proposals giving effect to the abolition of the Quarantine Board and providing for the future carrying out of the work of international interest at present carried out by the board. The Permanent Committee of the International Health Office would then draft an amending protocol to the convention for the acceptance of all the signatory Powers. 136. Dr. Morgan arrived in Egypt in November and embarked on discus sions, first with Amin Osman Pasha, then with Nahas Pasha, who set up a small Technical Committee of which the British representatives were Dr. Morgan and Mr. Besly of the Embassy. The agreement as to procedure was confirmed, and the discussions centred on the proposals to be submitted by the Egyptian Government for the carrying on, after the abolition of the Quarantine Board, of international services at present performed by it. On behalf of His Majesty’s Government, it was proposed that the Egyptian Government should invite the Paris office to act as a Technical Consultative Council with special reference to Suez Canal traffic, air transit traffic and the pilgrimage traffic to the holy places in Arabia or on the Mediterranean littoral. They should furnish an annual report to the Paris office and undertake not to modify the functions or personnel of the quarantine service, or to increase the quarantine dues without consulting the Paris office. They should further invite the Paris office to appoint three medical officers to be attached to the Egyptian Minister responsible for the quarantine service and pilgrimage, but on the basis that these three officers should be concerned solely with the international air and sea transit traffic, the terminal traffic to Egypt and all the purely Egyptian side of the Quarantine Board work being henceforth entrusted solely to the Egyptian Government. 137. For several weeks Nahas Pasha refused to agree to the appointment, for any fixed period, of European officials, and the Technical Committee were busy with drafting modifications of the relevant portions of the Sanitary Convention in so far as this could be done within the limits on which agreement had been reached. By the 20th December, however, he had agreed in principle to the appointment of three European officials as General Director, Director of the k.uez Quarantine Station and Director of Air Traffic respectively, to be under conti act as Egyptian Government officials for a period of five years. He was informed that the minimum period to which His Majesty’s Government would agree would be ten years. He had by this time agreed on the other points alluded to m the previous paragraph, while, as regards the procedure for dealing with the pilgrimages, it had been agreed that, provisionally, the Egyptian Government should, at the invitation of the Powers, declare pilgrimages to be clean or infected, but that this would be reconsidered if objections were raised bv Saudi Arabia or any other interested Power. In any event, the Egyptian Government agreed r!n alf °i- H 1 1S Ma .3 est y ,s Government that a commission, composed of the heads of the medical missions attached to the pilgrimages should sit at Jedda with the duty of unanimously pronouncing whethei the pilgrimage Nation at To^^rh^firalT Ct t0 conf f“ ation ° f the findin S s at th e qufrantme station at tor. the final decision on this matter, which is of sneeial irunnrtan^P contemplated™^ Paris In&lt; r, la ’ WaS , t0 be tak f n , as a result of the discussions tempfated at laris. It was also agreed that the Egyptian Ministrv of Finance should at once examine the financial aspect of the dismissal orre-engagement of the existing European personnel, and that this matter should be referred to m the agreement between the Egyptian Government and His Majesty s Government to be reached before the Paris discussions. 138. Matters having reached this stage, a draft of heads of agreement ^ Governments was prepared and handed to the Egyptian members of the Technical Committee on the 28th December. This document, which was intended to set ve as the basis tor the co-operation of the two Governments at Paris on the lines of the secret document (A) at Montreux, summarised all the points of agreement as set out above, while leaving blank the exact period for which the Egyptian Government would undertake to retain the services of the three European directors. It was understood from Amin Osman Pasha that Nahas Pasha was inclining towards the acceptance of the ten-year period, but the fall of his Government at the end of the month interrupted the discussions. 139. In formulating their proposals, His Majesty’s Government had been influenced by the following considerations. First, in the opinion of the Foreign Office legal advisers, while Egypt could only abolish the board or the foreign repre sentation thereon if the other parties to the Sanitary Convention agreed, she was apparently legally entitled to denounce the whole Sanitary Convention. Secondly, the Ministry of Health in London viewed the abolition of the board and its functions with equanimity so far as public health in the United Kingdom was concerned. It was further recognised that, on the purely medical side, Egyptian technical services had come into existence since the institution of the Quarantine Board and could not be represented to the Egyptian Government as quite incompetent. On the other hand, there was a very real danger that, through excessive zeal and administrative incompetence, a purely Egyptian service might involve vexatious and unnecessary interference with shipping passing through the Canal. There were also British possessions in the Mediterranean which were more exposed to risk of infection than the United Kingdom, and there was the interest taken by the Government of India in the pilgrimages. It was considered that the normal routine work could be safely left to the Egyptian Government, provided that, in the case of the air, Canal and pilgrimage traffic, there was for each a European director to exercise general supervision and counteract the fear of accepting responsibility, characteristic of Egyptian officials, which might otherwise lead to delays and excessive interference. “ Caisse de la Dette.” 140. A Special Commission for the service of the Egyptian Public Debt was created by a Khedival decree of 1876. A Guaranteed Loan was issued m 1885 and placed under this commission (“ Caisse de la Dette publique ”) in addition to the privileged and unified debts, by the Convention of London of 1885 between Great Britain, Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Italy, Russia and Turkey. The same signatories assented in 1904 to the promulgation of Law No. 17 ol the 28th November, which repealed the Khedival decree of 1876 and placed the “ Caisse de la Dette ” upon its existing basis. Germany, Austria Hungary and Turkey were all eliminated under various treaty arrangements resulting trom the Great‘War, and Russian rights lapsed. The actual commissioners since 1919 have represented Great Britain, France and Italy. It may be noted here that owing toEe guarantee given in 1885, an Act of Parliament is &gt; required in the United Kingdom for the suppression of the ‘ ‘ Caisse de la Dette. 141 The Egyptian Government, at the beginning of 1937, expressed to His Maiestv’s Embassy their desire to abolish the “ Caisse de la Dette and asked for advice It was pointed out to them that the assent of the three Powers renresented on the “Caisse ” must be obtained, and that, while His Majesty s Government were prepared to consider the abolition of the Caisse wit prejudicial to &amp;. V P . , , rp^prve fund amounting to £E. 1,800,000, SETfhf special^account'of P the n deb7 1 must n be t ende t d. e NefeXless' ^Egyptian Government took no further steps until after the Montreux Conference, when two meetings took place in London on the 14th May between Makram Pasha the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Egyptian Ambassador on the o e hand, and representatives of the Foreign Office and i reasury on the othei. 14-2. The Egyptian representatives were willing to agree that they should obtain the assent of the three Powers, and that the service of the debt should be conducted by the National Bank of Egypt. They objected to the granting of an irrevocable mandate to the National Bank, asked that the reserve fund mentioned above and the working capital fund of £E. 500,000 should be taken over by the Egyptian Government, and argued that the continued assignment of the land tax as specific security for the loan should be abolished. Eventually a foimula was agreed to the effect that the Egyptian Government should authorise the National Bank of Egypt to meet the service of the loans (until conversion or repayment),; that the existing security should be maintained, including the reserve fund of £E. 1,800,000, but that the working capital fund should be transferred to the Egyptian’Treasury; and that, while the assigned taxes should be paid direct to the Egyptian Treasury, they should be paid over by the Treasury to a special debt account at the National Bank of Egypt so far as required for the service^ of the current coupon. In this last clause the representatives of His Majesty’s Govern ment proposed to insert the words “ as collected ” after the word £ ‘ Treasury,” and this was now the only point of difference between the two Governments. In a letter enclosing a copy of the above formula, Mr. Campbell informed Makram Pasha that the agreement of His Majesty’s Government remained subject to a settlement on this point. 143. The Egyptian Ministers, on their way home through Paris, had meetings with the French authorities concerned. The latter, besides a somewhat academic request for payment in gold, asked that the Credit Lyonnais should act as paying agent both in Paris and in Egypt, and that there should be a French director on the National Bank of Egypt. These demands, except as regards the function of the Credit Lyonnais in Paris, were not supported by His Majesty’s Government. 144. The matter remained in suspense during the remainder of the year owing to the persistent objection of the Egyptian Government to the payment of the assigned taxes by the Egyptian Treasury to the special debt account “as and when collected.” It was, however, pointed out to them that, out of fifty-five foreign bonds quoted in The Times, thirty-four were secured on specific taxes, &amp;c., including French, German and Italian loans, and that, without the provision for payment to the separate account as collected, there would be no point in the assignment of special taxes as security. It was also pointed out that the invest ment market attached great importance to specific security, and that the retention of the words “as collected ” was necessary to prevent loss to bondholders and damage to Egyptian credit. Although Sir Frank Watson, when still financial adviser, had expressed the view that the Egyptian Government would object strongly to the continuation of the assignment for the land tax and had urged that it would be better to make the loan service a charge upon the whole Egyptian revenue, there were indications towards the end of the year that Makram Pasha was preparing to accept this condition, and towards the end of the year His Majesty’s Embassy prepared, on the basis of instructions from the Foreign Office, a draft for a decree and an agreement preliminary to the decree between the three Powers and the Egyptian Government. The draft agreement provided for— {a) W (d) I he abolition of the “ Caisse de la Dette ”; The assignment of the land tax, to be maintained at a minimum of £E. 4 million, unless the other parties assented to reductions propor tionally to future reductions of the debt; The payment of the land tax as collected into a special debt account at le -National Bank of Egypt, up to the amount required in each year tor the debt service; The reserve fund to be transferred to the special debt account, while the working capital fund should be handed over to the Egyptian Government; and In Natl0nt T 1 Ban 1 1 5 bein g wound up, similar arrangements to be made with some other reliable Egyptian bank.145. . The agreement and the decree specified that payment would be in sterling, 2.e., not m Egyptian currency. These drafts were awaiting the final approval of His Majesty s Government, preparatory to their being shown to the Egyptian Government, at the close of the year 1937. International Conventions. 146. By a decree of the 11th October Egypt acceded with effect from the 23rd June, 1937, to the 'proces-verbal signed in London on the 6th November, 1936, setting forth the rules as to the action of submarines with regard to merchant ships in time of war. 147. Egypt, as a Power with a Mediterranean seaboard, was invited to participate in the Nyon Conference regarding measures to combat submarine piracy in connexion with the Spanish civil war, and was a signatory to the Nyon Agreement of the 14th September, 1937. (B) Relations with Particular Countries. A byssinia. 148. An outstanding event of the year was the severance of the Coptic Church in Abyssinia from its ancient dependence upon the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria. Ever since the 4th century the Archbishop (Abuna) of the Abyssinian Church has been an Egyptian, nominated by the Patriarch of Alexandria, 149. Considerable apprehension in this respect was aroused in Egypt at the end of May by the arrival in Egypt of the Abuna Kyrillos at Suez on his way to Pome. Representatives of the Coptic Council were sent to meet him, but no opportunity was allowed him of speaking freely to them and they were unable to extract from him any definite reason for bis visit. 150. A press message from Rome on the 18th June stated that the archbishop had consented in principle to the separation of the Abyssinian Church from the Coptic Church of Egypt, and that his Beatitude promised that he himself would nominate the Abyssinian bishops who would organise the new Church. This report, however, was at least premature, and probably in the nature of a ballon d’essai. The archbishop certainly discussed in Rome the whole position of the Abyssinian Church, but on his return to Alexandria towards the end of July he confined himself in a statement to the press to saying that, during his conveisa- tion with the Duce, there had been no talk of the separation of the two Churches. What happened subsequently is not clear. The Abuna continued to stay m Egypt and was frequently visited by members of the Italian Legation, and from indications in the press it appeared that some compromise solution was under discussion whereby the Abuna would continue to be elected from the Egyptian clergy and to be consecrated by the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria, thoug e would thereafter be responsible to the Italian authorities by whom his own appointment and the appointment of bishops would be confirmed. Thest, negotiations however, appear to have been unsuccessful, and the decisive step was taken in Addis Ababa on the 29th November, when a number oi P relat es “ sympathetic ” to the Italian regime met under official auspices and elected the acting^.Abuna Abraham, to be Patriarch of the Ethiopian Church Six bishops were 'chosen at the same time, and the new Abuna consecrated first himself and then the six others. 1^1 This step caused indignation in the Coptic community in Egypt, an f , n l thp FL«Uan Government was not improved by the attitude of the the effect on the Egyp ran uove d th £ matter as a purely internal Italian Charge d Altai res f r ° t had no r i g ht even to ask for Italian affair in which the , D yp , | r&gt; 0D t an d then Acting Minister information.

The ST^n^^esFtuat^ Abyssinia could not be altered, merely to address adignified note of protest to the Italian Government. This advice was approved by His Majesty’s Government, who were not in favour of retaliation m irrelevant fields, but thought a strong protest fully justified. 153. The Italian Legation were meanwhile in direct touch with the Coptic Patriarchate, and it seemed for some days that some face-saving compromise would after all be reached, but when in the latter half of December the Lg\ ptian Minister in Rome spoke on the subject to the Italian Minister foi Foreign Anairs, Count Ciano brushed his remarks aside and merely stated that Italy regarded the question as definitely settled. 154 On the 28th December the Egyptian Government handed a formal note of protest to the Italian Charge d’Affaires, and the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt on the same day excommunicated the Amba Abraham and all clerics who recognised him. France. 155. The French participated in the Montreux Conference with a particularly jealous eye to the rights of foreigners after the abolition of the Capitulations and to French interests. Otherwise, their activities continued to be mainly in the cultural sphere. At the beginning of the year M. Emile Fabre, an ex-director of the Comedie franqaise, was temporarily engaged by the Egyptian Government to advise them on the reorganisation of the Arabic National Theatre, and this led to the appointment in October of M. Maurice Flandre as stage manager of that theatre. 156. In September the French Government invited the Egyptian Govern ment to choose five Egyptian university students, three from the faculty of letters and two from the faculty of law, to spend a year in France, each with a bursary of 10,000 fr. provided by the “ Association des Amies de FOrient ” in Paris, and all travelling expenses paid. 157. In July there were rumours that the French intended to raise their Legation in Egypt to the status of an Embassy. Subsequent enquiries in Paris showed that this suggestion actually originated with the Egyptian Minister in Paris, who was himself anxious for ambassadorial rank. The French Government did not themselves appear to look with favour on the idea. The opportunity was, however, taken by His Majesty’s Ambassador, on the instructions of the Foreign Office, to draw the attention of Makram Ebeid Pasha, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the permanent precedence given to the British Ambassador in Egypt at the time of the Treaty of Alliance. Makram Pasha said that there could be no question regarding the special status conferred on the British Ambassador, and that this would at once be made clear to any foreign Power which might desire to raise the status of its Legation in Egypt to that of an Embassy. Germany. lo8. The Geiman interest in Egypt continued to be mainly commercial and m particular, endeavours were made by German firms to obtain contracts for war material. As shown m the “ Civil Aviation” section of this report, constant pressure was also kept up by the German Legation and by Lufthansa to obtain nymg facilities m Egypt, and there was a good deal of propaganda designed to impress the Egyptians with the excellence of German aircraft. 159. It became known in the autumn that the German firm of Otto Wolff had concluded an agreement with Labib Nessim, an Egyptian who had obtained a concession for iron mining at Assouan, whereby Messrs. Otto Wolff were to suddIv machinery up to a certain value and to buy the iron-ore at certain rates. The agreement was conditional upon Labib Nessim obtaining the necessary capital to Iraq. of th^Ira^i'ljOTernment^^iich^produced^n the® AydF 1 ' im P ulsiveness attitude of greater reserve than perhaps would otherwiseTaveTeen the^SfTo?35 instance, Iraq responded eagerly to the suggestion that she should invite Egypt to become a member of the League, and was, in fact, the first country to issue such an invitation. The effect, however, was rather spoiled by a hasty, prolix and somewhat tactless communication to the League, and by premature publicity of the fact that the invitation had been issued. This was not calculated to do Egypt any service at Geneva, where Iraq’s reputation as a good member of the League did not stand very high. 161. Again, in regard to Palestine, the Prime Minister of Iraq rushed into declarations as soon as the recommendations of the Royal Commission were known in July. This attitude was deplored by Nahas Pasha, and was no doubt partly responsible for the cautious attitude which the Egyptian Government took up, as described in the section of this report on Palestine. 162. In May the Iraqi Government submitted to the Egyptian Government a draft commercial treaty between the two countries based on most-favoured nation treatment, and including, it is believed, a provision for reducing tariff rates on Iraqi dates exported to Egypt. The Ministry of Commerce approved the draft, but it had not yet been considered by the Council of Ministers at the end of the year. 163. In September His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad reported unfavourable comments in the Iraqi press on the quality and methods of the Egyptian teachers who had been obtained through the Egyptian Government for service in Iraq. Nevertheless, in the same month the Iraqi Government were reported to have requested the Egyptian Ministry of Education to assist them in obtaining professors for the Law School in Bagded and a number of secondary school teachers. 164. After the Bekr Sidqi coup d’Etat in Iraq, Nuri Pasha, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, fled to Egypt, and was a refugee here for a considerable part of the year. Italy. 165. Early in the year there were persistent rumours in the press and elsewhere that proposals were afoot for a treaty of friendship between Egypt and Italy. Nahas Pasha, however, assured His Majesty’s Ambassador that there was no truth in these rumours, and that the Italians had made no proposal of this sort, either to himself or to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 166. When in February the question of an Egyptian application for membership of the League was being discussed, the Egyptian Minister in Rome was treated by Count Ciano to a long and violent denunciation of the League, ending with a statement that the Italian Government, though very friendly with Egypt, could not invite anyone to join such a mischievous and moribund institution. 167. Nahas Pasha received an invitation from Signor Mussolini to visit Rome after the Montreux Conference, but the Prime Minister decided not to go. In order not to give too great offence to the Italians, who pressed the matter strongly, it was arranged that Makram Pasha should go instead, and the visit took place ostensibly in connexion with negotiations for the abolition of the “ Caisse de la Dette.” Both Nahas Pasha and Makram Pasha, as a result of further rumours of an agreement between Italy and Egypt, assured His Majesty’s Ambassador that nothing political other than the ‘ £ Caisse de la Dette ’ ’ had been discussed. 168. As the summer wore on, the increasing reinforcement of the Libyan garrison excited a good deal of attention in Egypt, and turned the minds of the Egyptian Government still further towards defence questions. Italian propa ganda was busily insinuating, however, that the danger to Egypt was her connexion with Great Britain, who was in any case not in a position to protect her and Ismail Sidky Pasha, by a letter to Nahas Pasha and a question in Parliament, exploited the argument that Egypt should dispense with the necessit&gt; for British protection by making terms with Italy.169 In September His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was instructed to make it clear to Nahas Pasha that His Majesty’s Government would expect to be informed if the Italian Government made proposals for a treaty of any kind with Egypt, and to warn him both of the possible dangers of entering into negotiations with Italy while Anglo-Italian relations were strained, and of the desirability oi ensuring that any treaty did not conflict with hgypt s obligations under the treaty of alliance. Nahas Pasha promised to take no steps until His Majesty’s Government were able to tell him that a successful outcome of Anglo-Italian conversations was definitely expected, and he undertook that if any Italo- Egyptian treaty were in question he would consult Elis Majesty’s Government step by step. 170. The para-military activities of the Italian Fascist organisations in Egypt had been for some time a source of some anxiety, which was increased by the proposal of the Italian Government to appoint as their Minister in Cairo Signor Parini, who had long been the chief organiser of Italian Fascist activities abroad. With the backing of His Majesty’s Government, the Egyptian Govern ment risked giving great offence to Italy by refusing the necessary agrement. The Italians thought it best to accept the refusal, unpalatable though it was, and appointed Signor Mazzolini, who, although he had attained notoriety in South America similar to that of Signor Parini, was yet a lesser light. 171. Further friction sprang up between Egypt and Italy as a result of the severance at the end of November of the long connexion between the Abyssinian Church and the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria. This question is more fully dealt with under the heading “ Abyssinia.” 172. Italian propaganda addressed to the Moslem world in general, and Egypt in particular, continued throughout the year. Both the radio station at Bari and the local Italian and subsidised Egyptian press were employed in addition to a cultural drive to attract Egyptians to the sixty-two Italian schools and to the facilities for Egyptian students to visit Italy. Signor Mussolini’s claim, made on the occasion of the opening of the new coastal motor road in Libya, to be the Defender of the Moslem Faith was, however, ridiculed in Egypt, where the drastic methods employed by Italy in the subjugation of Libya have not been torgotten. The press, however, probably acting under instructions in view of the approaching Montreux Conference, was very restrained in its comments. .v iPf' Eff( T ts ’ n( &gt;t attended with any great success, have been made to induce the Bedouin who fled from Libya into Egypt to return to Libya, by the promise of exceptional generous treatment.

The Egyptian Government formulated their observations on the draft Extradition Treaty submitted to them in 1936. The matter is still under consiaeration. . But the importance of Palestine during the year lay not in the sphere of its direct relations with Egypt, but in the indirect effect on British relations with Egypt and othei Near Eastern countries of His Maiesty’s Government’s policy in Palestine. 179. The publication of the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine at the beginning of July, with its recommendations as regards partition, created consternation in Egypt, as in other Moslem countries, and Nahas Pasha at once expressed his concern, though he had nothing but disapproval for the action of the Prime Minister of Iraq in rushing into public declarations on the subject. In reply to an interpellation by Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha on the 20th July, Nahas Pasha deprecated discussion of the Palestinian question in the Egyptian Parliament. 180. But whilst the attitude of the Government was correct, there was wide spread condemnation of the idea of partition. 181. In July, when the Saudi Arabian Minister suggested that Egypt should join with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria and the Yemen in jointly protesting to His Majesty’s Government against partition, Nahas Pasha was torn between his desire to help Great Britain and his anxiety to play a prominent role in the Palestine question among neighbouring Arab States. He decided, however, to keep his hands free, while deploring our Palestine policy in conversations with the Embassy, and offering to try to devise ways out of the impasse. It was clear that he feared the establishment at Egypt’s door of a wealthy and possibly expansionist Jewish State, and his suggested solution was the creation of an independent Arab State in Palestine, allied to Great Britain, and with the fullest guarantees of religious and racial toleration for Jews, Moslems and Christians alike. 182. Towards the end of August His Majesty’s Government expressed appreciation of the Prime Minister’s refusal to be drawn into collective action or to encourage local agitation, and sent him a message to the effect that, while partition offered, in their view, the best hope of solution, there would be full opportunity for discussion with both Arabs and Jews after the League of Nations had expressed its opinion, and that it would be the endeavour of His Majesty’s Government to see that nothing was done in the meantime to make an ultimate solution on the lines of even justice between both races more difficult. His Majesty’s Government hoped they might rely on Nahas Pasha to co-operate in this. 183. Nahas Pasha was at first minded to go himself to Geneva when the Palestine question came before the League in September. In the event, however, he decided not to go, owing to the internal political situation, and the Egyptian delegation was headed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wacyf Boutros Ghali Pasha. 184 About this time the Egyptian Government were being harried by the Palestine Arabs to take action on their behalf, and emissaries of the Mufti came to Egypt for that purpose. It was difficult for Nahas Pasha, m face of Arab opinion generally and his own position in internal Egyptian politics, to r&lt; ^ ralI J from active intervention, and this no doubt explains the speech which Wacyf Ghali Pasha made at Geneva. The speech was critical m tone and was taken as a proof of Egypt’s real independence. 185. The dismissal of the Mufti, the arrest of various members of the Supreme Moslem Council and their deportation to the Seychelles at the beginning of October was the signal for a fresh outburst m the Egyptian press, which did not fail to point to the parallel of Zaghlul. His Majesty’s Minister exp amed to Makram Ebeid Pasha the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, on instructions from His Majesty’s Government, that the measures taken had no political motive, hutwere necessary for the maintenance of law and order, m view of the recrudescence of the campaign of violence m Palestine, resulting in the murdei o British officials.186 Irresponsible agitation apart, Egyptian public opinion, in spite of its sympathy with the Palestinian Arabs, remained on the whole relatively calm as regSds Palestine. But there was a growing body of influential opinion which vifwed with grave misgiving the way in which events were developing, and this was crystallised in a petition addressed to the Embassy on the 21st November by a widely representative number of Senators and Deputies which, while stressing the friendship felt by Egypt for Great Britain, appealed for a settlement of the Palestine question on a just and equitable basis. Saudi A rabia. 187. The improved relations between Pgypt and Saudi Arabia, referred to in paragraph 86 of last year’s report, resulted in the despatch from Cairo of the Holy Carpet during the pilgrimage season, and in the resumption of payments by the Egyptian Government of the proceeds of the Wakfs and charitable funds on the former basis. Turkey. 188. On the 7th April, after protracted negotiations—protracted on account of the attitude of King Fuad-three agreements were signed between Egypt and Turkey. These were a Treaty of Friendship, an Establishment Treaty and a Nationality Convention, the latter relating to the right to opt for Turkish and Egyptian nationality respectively of certain categories of persons resident in Egypt or Turkey before the 5th November, 1914. 189. The agreements were ratified by the Parliaments of both countries, and it was arranged that the exchange of ratifications should take place in Cairo during a visit to Egypt of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, which it was suggested should take place in the winter of 1938. 190. Certain documents signed at the same time as the above-mentioned instruments have not so far been published. They consisted of an exchange of notes attached to the Treaty of Friendship, and an exchange of notes and a final protocol attached to the Nationality Convention. In the first exchange of notes the two Governments undertook to do everything possible to foster their mutual commercial relations. In the second the Turkish Government recognised that the Nationality Convention was inapplicable to members of the Egyptian Royal Family and that these were Egyptian nationals in their own right and not, there fore, called upon to opt to become so. On their part the Egyptian Government recognised the Turkish rights of princesses and other Egyptian ladies married to Turkish citizens. The final protocol declared that optants need not leave the country whose nationality they had renounced, but that, in the case of Turkey, the assumption of the new nationality would not affect any judicial or administrative measures which might previously have been taken' against them as Turkish citizens. Chapter IV.— Relations between Egypt and the Sudan. General. , Relations between Egypt and the Sudan during the year 1937 continued to be satisfactory. In Egypt attention was mainly concentrated on the various steps to be taken to implement the Sudan clauses of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, anc these are dealt with below under separate headings. But by far the greatest pubbc interest was accorded to the question of the return of the Egyptian forces to the Sudan. wqc il n J nat , rs d ]re ctly connected with the treaty, the most outstanding nrnb^W a g ltatl °n m the press, fostered by Sheikh El Maraghi and El Azhar— oDDres [on nf n M T P t0 d :f re o dlt ^ Wafdist CWnment-against the alleged Government to Tn the Southern Sudan, and the attempt of the Sudan on MoskmCnd Of a K m ^ S ° U * h %\ a .

The Governor-General, while continuing to deprecate any public announcement, furnished material for a reply which, it was thought, should satisfy the Prime Munster and the Sheikh El Maraghi; but as the agitation in El Azhar had died down and neither the Prime Minister nor the sheikh reverted to the subject, it was not found necessary to make use of this. Arrangements were made for an unofficial party of young Sudanese notables, both officials and private persons, to visit the United Kingdom at the expense of the Sudan Government on the occasion of the coronation of His Majesty King George VI. As a result of enquiries addressed to the Ambassador by the Prime Munster as to the intentions of the Sudan Government in regard to arrangements for celebrating the accession of His Majestv King Farouk, it was arranged at the last moment to send a similar but equally unofficial delegation to attend the accession ceremonies in Cairo. The visit passed off successfully, the behaviour of the visitors being markedly modest and correct. 194. El Sayed Abdel Rahman-el-Mahdi, K.B.E., C.V.O., paid a short visit to Egypt on his way home to the Sudan from a six weeks' visit to the United Kingdom. Considerable doubts had been expressed as to the desirability of his visiting Egypt, more particularly in view of the unfortunate exploitation by the Egyptian authorities of the passage through Egypt of the Sudan unofficial delegation, which attended the coronation in London and which had included his son El Sayed Sadik. It was felt, however, that in view of the inevitable reper cussions, both in Egypt and the Sudan, it was impossible to go to the length of forbidding the visit, and in the circumstances action was confined to warning the Sayed seriously against exploitation by his Egyptian hosts. He undertook to prevent any such exploitation and to restrict his visit to one week. This under taking he faithfully carried out, and his attitude throughout the visit was most correct. He appeared to be genuinely anxious to do nothing which might spoil the effect of his visit to England. Return of Egyptian Forces to the Sudan (Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Article 11, paragraph 3 and paragraph XVI of Agreed Minute). 195. During the first few months of 1937 the Egyptian military authorities were fully occupied in considering the numerous proposals put forward by the British military mission regarding the reorganisation of the Egyptian army. It was accordingly not until the middle of March that the Prime Minister informed the Embassy that, in accordance with paragraph XVI of the Agreed Minute to the treaty, he proposed to send Ibrahim Khairy Pasha, Under-Secretary for War, to Khartum to consult with the Sudan authorities regarding the detailed arrange ments for the return of the Egyptian troops to the Sudan. 196. Khairy Pasha arrived in Khartum on the 14th April, and during the course of conversations with the Governor-General and the Kaid-el-Amm, he was informed of the views of the Sudan Government in regard to the number of Egyptian troops required, and the place at which they should be stationed. These proposals did not include the permanent stationing of any Egyptian troops in Khartum itself, but it became evident, both from the discussions with Khairy Pasha and subsequent conversations between the Ambassador and Nahas Pasha, that the Egyptian Government and Egyptian public opinion would not be satisfied unless at least a part of a battalion were permanently stationed m Khartum. Every possible effort was made to convince the Egyptian authorities of the folly of sending any more troops to the Sudan than was absolutely necessary during the period when the reorganisation of the Egyptian army was taking place under the military mission, but it became clear that in the eyes of the Egyptian Govern ment everything must be subordinated in this matter to political considerations. 197 After protracted consultation with the Foreign Office and the Sudan Government it was decided to accept the Egyptian Government s wishes and wiTgreement between the Ambassador and the Prime Minister was accordingly reached on the 27th July, which provided for /p The exercise of supreme command over all forces in the Sudan, whether W Sudanese, British or Egyptian, by the the Sudan Defence Force acting m the name of the Governor-General.40 (ii) Complete equality of treatment of the Egyptian and British forces stationed in the Sudan. (iii) The stationing in the Sudan of two Egyptian infantry battalions, one coast defence detachment for Port Sudan, and, when available, anti aircraft batteries and searchlight companies for Khartum, Atbara and Port Sudan. The first battalion was required for Port Sudan, but pending the completion of accommodation there two companies were to be stationed at Khartum. When this accommodation was completed a second battalion was to be sent to Khartum, of which two companies would be stationed at Gebel Aulia, 20 miles away from Khartum to guard the Gebel Aulia dam. 198. The title of the British officer commanding the joint forces in the Sudan was changed from “ Kaid-el-Amm ” to “ Major-General Commanding ” at the particular request of Nahas Pasha, as the former appeared to Egyptian ears to encroach upon the authority of the King of Egypt as “ Commander-in- chief.” In spite of this, when the agreement came to be embodied in a decision of the Council of Ministers, dated the 30th August, the reference to the unity of command was altered so as to avoid any specific reference to the British officer commanding, though fully recognising the supreme authority of the Governor- General in military matters. Further discussion on this rather thorny point took place between the Minister of War and the Governor-General during the latter’s visit to Cairo in October. Full agreement was finally reached thereon, the Minister of War accepting the suggestion that the senior Egyptian officer, though in general charge of the Egyptian forces, should be described as Chief Staff Officer. 199. On the 24th December the 7th battalion of the Egyptian army left for Khartum after a vociferous send-off from Cairo. They were warmly welcomed in Khartum when they were inspected by the Governor-General and where the whole battalion remained for one night, headquarters and two companies leaving for Port Sudan the following day. &amp; Return of Egyptian Officials to the Sudan (Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Article 11 paragraph 3 and paragraph XV of the Agreed Minute). s A regards recruitment of Egyptian candidates for posts in the Sudan service not already in Egyptian Government service, it was arranged by the Sudan enrollhiT^c that it 6 Sudan M 61 ? 5 '. 111 Cairo should be given the same powers of oiling, &amp;c as the controller of the Sudan Government Office in London As secure the adSffin of EgypliaTstofhe'sudfn pffiilffiaufjfica 11 G ° VerPnment t0 *** Tm», Article 11 , was 8,063 aseppcsecTtcoi the 1037 bulk under contract, who would normal! labourers admitted in their employment in the Sudan t'.■ &lt;:U | ' ri1 t0 Egypt on the termination of Affairs raised with the counsellor of ir.J \r '' ,. t l i Min ister for Foreign abolishing the existing 10-piastre visa feXlAw S , Em b aSSy the P ossi bility of Sudan.

Moreover, it mignt well be argued that under article 6 of the Condominium Agreement of 18.99 any concession extended to British subjects would also have to be extended to all Europeans. As the result of consultation between the Foreign Office, the Embassy^nd the Sudan Government it was agreed that paragraph 5 of article 11 of the treaty should be interpreted as modifying article 6 of the Condominium Agreement to the extent that British subjects should now be regarded as occupying the same privileged position as Egyptians in regard to immigration into the Sudan. It was also agreed that there was no need to seek the agreement of the Egyptian Government to this interpretation, but that by presenting them with individual proposals such as that for the abolition of visa fees for Egyptian nationals and British subjects, it would be possible to build up a series of precedents embodying the above interpretation. 202. It was agreed that the above proposal should accordingly be put to the Passport Department by the Sudan agent, but that it should be coupled with a demand for the removal of the existing regulation that a British subject entering the Sudan via Egypt should be required to pay for an ordinary Egyptian visa instead of a transit visa—a requirement believed to have been inspired by the Egyptian desire to emphasise the unity of the Sudan with Egypt. Negotiations were still in progress at the end of the year. Participation of the Sudan Government in International Conventions and Conferences (Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Annex to Article 11). 203. Proposals for implementing the provisions of the annex to article 11 of the treaty providing for the participation of the Sudan in international conten tions and the representation of Sudan interests at international conferences were made in August to Makram Pasha, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs through Amin Osman Pasha. In spite of repeated assurances that these proposals were being studied in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, no reply had been received from Makram Pasha when the Government fell at the end of the year. The receipt in the meanwhile of notes from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs containing nroDOsals in regard to specific conferences which conflicted with the Embassy s proposals confirmed the belief (shared by Amin Osman Pasha) that Makram as a had not communicated a copy of the Embassy s proposals to the Ministry at all. It was arranged at the end of the year that the matter should be taken up af with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Correspondence between the Governor-General and t f Egyptian Government (Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Note XIV to Agreed Minute). 904 Before the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty all communica tions between the Egyptian and Sudan Got61 '^ In' interd^artmentoiTOrrespondence^ were^ made. j^pjwn that the Governor- feSsIoull ^ V British report on the administration of the th e entry into force of notified directly to the Egyptian Pnme Mmmten ^ Js in regard to the treaty, steps were accordingly ^ ordinances should be the issue of Sudan Ordmanc , , - ( m J er cover of a formal despatch communicated by the Governor-General ^ been given to the Egyptian to the Prime Minister.

To this Nahas Pasha agreed. 206. In practice no communication is made by the Governor-General to the Prime Minister or received from him without the full knowledge of the Embassy, who are thus in a position to make known their views, or if necessary consult the Foreign Office. The arrangement worked smoothly throughout the year. Egyptian Subvention to the Sudan. 207. Provision for the payment of the Egyptian Government’s annual subvention to the Sudan of £E. 750,000 was made in the 1937 budget. After some discussion in the Chamber of Deputies it was passed by Parliament without any conditions being attached to its payment. In September it was reported to the Embassy that King Farouk, in conversation with Nahas Pasha, had urged the suppression of the subvention. Nahas Pasha had refused to consider the sugges tion, but Makram Pasha was reported as having favoured the idea of making capital out of the proposal. The question of the attitude to be adopted in the event of the Egyptian Government raising the matter was discussed at an Inter departmental Conference in London at which the Governor-General of the Sudan was present. It was agreed that any attempt to secure suppression or drastic reduction should be strongly resisted as inconsistent with the obligation of the Egyptian Government to give adequate notice in accordance with the terms of the Fass-Makram Agreement (see 1936 annual report, paragraph 100), but that it would be difficult to resist a demand for a moderate £ ‘ token ’ ’ reduction. The Minister of Finance, Makram Pasha, raised the matter with the Governor-General during his Excellency’s visit to Cairo in October, and in view of the state of the Egyptian Government’s finances proposed giving a year’s notice of a 50 per cent, reduction. The Governor-General replied that the notice was too short and the cut too drastic, but gave it as his personal opinion that a reduction of £E. 250,000 as an absolute maximum might be acceptable. Makram Pasha undertook to raise the matter with the Ambassador, but had not done so by the end of the year when the Government went out of office. Trade between Egypt and the Sudan. 208. The value of imports into Egypt from the Sudan for the first nine months of 1937 amounted to £E. 633,835, compared with £E. 485,247 during the corresponding period of 1936, an increase of £E. 148,588. 209. The principal Sudanese exports which increased in value were haricot beans, coffee beans, millet, ground nuts, sesame, dyeing or tanning materials, and hides and skins, whilst the main decreases were in living animals and chick-peas. 210. Ihe value of exports from Egypt to the Sudan during the same periods amounted to £E. 735,401 and £E. 713,179, representing an increase of £E. 22,222 in 1937. 21!.

It appeared to he extremely desirable to prevent the establishment of Italian banks or firms in Khartum which, as shown in the case of the Ala Littoria Aviation Company, would inevitably become centres for Italian espionage and subversive activities. On the other hand, as the result of enquiries into the legal position, it was clear that, without passing special legislation, it would be difficult to discriminate against Italian banks or firms. The Sudan Government were doubtful about the expediency of such legislation, but undertook to prepare drafts. In the meantime, in view of the constant pressure on the part of the representative of the bank at Khartum, the Foreign Office authorised the Governor-General to reply that permission could only be given in return for an assurance that reciprocal facilities would be granted at Addis Ababa for the establishment of branches of British or Egyptian banks. Replies in the above sense were given to the representatives of the Banca di Roma and the Banca Commerciale Italiana. The Egyptian Government were not consulted in the matter, but the Prime Minister was informed though Amin Osman Pasha of the receipt of these applications and the Governor-General’s replies thereto. Chapter V.—Miscellaneous. Civil Aviation. 214. In the extremely tangled history of civil aviation in Egypt during 1937 four main threads are distinguishable :— (1) The difficulties of maintaining the British interest in the Anglo-Egyptian company, Misr Airwork. (2) The difficulties of Misr Airwork itself with the Egyptian Government. (3) The difficulties of the Director-General of Civil Aviation in securing the adoption of his recommendations for the proper organisation of civil aviation. (4) The attempts on our part to prevent the establishment m Egypt of foreign aviation interests other than British. 215. It may be well in the first place to explain briefly what was the position at the beginning of 1937. Civil aviation within Egypt was the monopoly of Misr Airwork, an Anglo-Egyptian company founded in 1932 by agreement between Airwork’ (Limited), Heston, and the Banque Misr. This company was subsidised by the Egyptian Government and operated the following services : (i) A daily return service between Alexandria, Port Said, Cairo and Assiout. (ii) A thrice-daily return service between Cairo and Alexandria. (iii) A daily return service to Palestine. (iv) A twice-weekly service to and from Bagdad. There was also a summer service to Cyprus, and negotiations were m between Misr Airwork and the Government of Cyprus for an all-year-round air mail service between Egypt and Cyprus. In addition to these services, an important part of the Misr Airwork activities was a training school at Almaza air port, near Cairo. 216 There was no foreign air line service terminating in Egypt, but in addition to the Imperial Airways services to India and South Afncm whrch were to be greatly increased under the P^l“ted Empire h'Af f r o n i Europe to the Duhh Eas' Indie’s, and’The AhT Littoria (Italian) froL Rome via Bengazi through Egypt and the Sudan to Abyssinia and Eritrea.217. Durino- 1936 His Majesty’s Government had unsuccessfully attempted to combat German influence in Greek civil aviation, and following up their success in Greece the German Government in December 1936 made an application to the Egyptian Government for facilities for a Berlin-Cairo service via Athens. An eventual extension eastwards was vaguely spoken of and it was known that the Germans were also trying to get facilities in Xiao, Persia and Afghanistan with the object of establishing a line to the Far East. His Majesty’s Government saw political and strategical objections to allowing the Germans to get a foothold in Egypt, and wished, moreover, to obviate the necessity of refusing at a later stage an application which they anticipated from the Germans for landing rights in India. The Embassy was accordingly instructed to make every effort to get the German application refused by the Egyptian Government. 218. It was not easy to find grounds on which such an application could be indefinitely refused, and the position was complicated by the fact that the K.L.M. line applied for facilities to run an additional service to Egypt to connect with Dutch shipping lines to the East, while the Ala Littoria company were reported to be exploring the possibilities of linking up their existing line with a line which they had recently established through Rhodes to Haifa. 219. These developments coincided with a decline in the British holding in Misr Airwork. This enterprise began with a capital of £E. 20,000, divided into “ A ” and ££ B ” shares. The ££ A ” shares, which, according to the statute of the company, must constitute not less than 60 per cent, of the total capital, could only be held by Egyptians. It was evidently the intention at the outset that all the ££ B ” shares should be held by Airwork Heston, but the statute merely stipulated that such shares ££ may be held by foreigners.” Of the original share capital, the full 40 per cent. (£E. 8,000) was taken up by Airwork Heston, the remaining 60 per cent, being held by the Banque Misr or its nominees. There was a separate arrangement between Airwork Heston and the Banque Misr under which Airwork Heston acted as technical and commercial advisers to Misr Airwork, and as its buying agent. Under this arrangement, the Banque Misr undertook to do its best to maintain a British member on the board of Misr Airwork so long as Airwork Heston held at least 10 per cent, of the capital, and to reserve to the British group seats on the board proportional in number to its total capital holding. From the inception of the company there had been three British members on the board of directors, and the majority of the pilots and engineers were British. But the increase of the company’s activities had necessitated an increase of capital from the original £E. 20,000 to £E. 80,000, and Airwork Heston had found it impossible to increase their holding, which remained at £E. 8,000. This represented, therefore, no longer 40 per cent., but only 10 per cent., of the total. At the beginning of the year Mr. Alan Muntz, who was the moving spirit on the British side, was still trying unsuccessfully to find the means to bring the British holding up to the full 40 per cent., and was somewhat reluctantly turning to Imperial Airways for help in this direction. 220 Starting with the object of blocking the German and other similar ^ k 0m f0 u lgn al F lines ’ 80 as t0 s ive msv Airwork every chance to develop, and of simultaneously assisting Mr. Muntz to bring the British holding in Misr Airwork to the full 40 per cent, and safeguarding the interests of Captain BonrThVr)^ 6 Ur' 6 de T lo § m ^ nt . 1 of E SyP tian civil aviation, Group reserW^ Mkr AO- r' G6n l ra U' 1 Aviation &gt; conceived the idea of reserving to Misr Airwork a “short-haul” traffic area in and around Fgvnt combined with some form of link-up between Imperial Airways and^Iisr Airwork ^rt hlul areTfnVlnUFr^ 1 Misr Airwork to deVelop Te snort naul area and m Misr acting as feeder m that area for the ImnerUl between points within the short-haul aria resided fir m“sI Airw“l° the GmkailappUatiUto tnbtfal Uthl U U™ “UU willin g to block indefinitely mentioned the idea as a personl ksulrglltion tlUdhUpA 6 U® at once said it coincided with his own view^ tIT a 1 N f has Pasha, who His Majesty’s Government, who approved it in pnndplU^ th6n SublMtted to52 45 Pash? 2 th P fT,? nW A 1 ' 6 ’ C T 6 t0 Ca ; iro in March to sound Talaat Harb Faslia, the president of Misr Airwork, as to his willingness to accept some form Harh S Wlth Impenal Ai ; wa y s - The Vlslt was I10t a ^ckss TaS „ omp b hf t ; a r r m a su spicious frame of mmd, and evidently apprehensive of 'ZLrn M S ^ em f Whlch mig 1 ht result in Im P^ial Airways swamping his A P 1 J- Muntz came to the conclusion that it was impossible to secure his agreement to anything m the nature of financial participation of Imperial irways m Misr Airwork Talaat Harb Pasha, however, appeared to realise e advantages of practical collaboration between Imperial Airways and Misr irwork and Mr. Muntz returned to England to see whether anything on these imes could be arranged. Ihe then Minister of Communications, Nokrashy Pasha, subsequently had a frank discussion with Talaat Harb Pasha on the lines that Misr Airwork was bound sooner or later to be frozen out if it did not get in with some big organisation like Imperial Airways; that all civil lines had a potential military value; and that this was an additional reason for Anglo-Egyptian co-operation. Nokrashy Pasha derived the same impression as Mr. Muntz, namely, that Talaat Harb Pasha was willing to work with Imperial Airways but not to be financed by them. Various suggestions by the Director-General of Civil Aviation as to the form which practical, as opposed to financial, collaboration might take were submitted to the Foreign Office by the Embassy. 223. Throughout April and May matters drifted. It was understood that Mr. Muntz was having discussions with Imperial Airways in London, but so far as could be gathered in Cairo these discussions were not very hopeful, and appeared in any case to be more concerned with the idea of an Egypt-Europe service than with the development of a short haul area round Egypt for the purpose of keeping out other foreign lines. No progress seemed likely for some time to come, and meanwhile one important fact emerged, namely, that Airwork Heston had decided not to increase their holding in Misr Airwork beyond the existing 10 per cent. This was serious in view of developments in Egypt. The Germans continued to be active. Not only did the German Legation keep up pressure on the Egyptian Government to grant facilities for a German service, but a representative of Lufthansa came to Cairo and discussed direct with Misr Airwork the possibility of some pooling arrangement. The Germans had pre viously made a great propaganda effort by spectacular participation in the Egyptian Oasis Rally in March, and Germany was clearly prepared to sell air craft at almost any price in order to get an interest in Misr Airwork. The only obstacle in fact was the agreement between the Banque Misr and Airwork Heston, and though Talaat Harb Pasha showed no signs of wishing to break away from this, it was disquieting that the vice-president of the company was Taher Pasha, known for his German connexions and sympathies, and that the managing director, Kemal Eloui Bey, seemed somewhat impatient of the British connexion and imbued, temporarily at all events, with the idea of the total Egyptianisation of the company. Kemal Eloui Bey was at that time working out a project for an Egypt-Europe service, in connexion with which he was later sent by his board to visit Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America to report on types of machines and on ground organisation. Apart from the question whether Misr Airwork could ever run a service of the type projected unaided by the experience of some foreign organisation, it was clear that further increases of capital would be involved which might have the result of reducing the British holding below the 10 per cent, necessary to maintain a single British director on the board. The only encouraging feature was that Misr Airwork applied to the Ministry of Communications to protect them from foreign compe tition by rejecting applications from foreign lines for an Egypt-Europe service until such time as they had been able to work out their own plans. 224 Meanwhile the various British authorities in Egypt who had con- idered the question of civil aviation had become increasingly conscious, more iarticularly in view of the growing tension with Italy, of its potential military mportance. For instance, constant changes m the pilots on the Ala Littoria ervice through Egypt and the Sudan left little doubt that this service was being sed to build up a large reserve of pilots who knew the route and the countiy. ; he Air Officer Commanding considered it important to restrict as far as possible he oneration of foreign lines in what would be, m the event of war a vital entre* of communications for the British Empire, and he pointed out also thatany assistance which Egypt could offer in time of war in the way of material and trained personnel might be most useful. A meeting was accordingly held on the 1st June between the Ambassador, the General Officer Commanding, the Air Officer Commanding, and the Chief of the Military Mission, to consider the whole position. It was felt that the matter could no longer be left for discussion between the companies directly concerned, namely, Misr Airwork and Imperial Airways, in the light of their private interests only, but that the time had come to lift the whole matter on to a much broader governmental plane, particularly in view of the fact that both companies were heavily subsidised by their respective Govern ments. The Foreign Office were informed by telegram that the meeting was agreed that the development of civil aviation in Egypt was primarily a defence problem and a vital one. The telegram stressed the importance of excluding foreign interests from Egyptian aviation and restricting so far as possible the operations of foreign lines, and recommended that steps be taken to ensure .that no foreign financial interest other than British should be introduced into Misr Airwork and to urge upon the Egyptian Government the advantages of a link-up between Misr Airwork and Imperial Airways. A second telegram suggested the terms of an aide-memoire which it was. proposed that the Ambassador might be authorised to communicate to the Prime Minister. A certain amount of telegraphic correspondence followed, as His Majesty’s Government were not con vinced that the reservation of a short haul area for Misr was practicable, since countries such as Greece would presumably make facilities conditional upon reciprocity. The Embassy suggested that it might, nevertheless, be capable of application in a modified form and urged once more the importance of reviewing the whole question of civil aviation from the military angle and of working out some form of co-operation between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork with the object of maintaining British influence in Egyptian aviation and keeping out foreign influence. Eventually, the Ambassador was authorised to communi cate to Nahas Pasha a slightly modified form of the proposed aide-memoire, and this was done on the 28th July. The aide-memoire suggested that (a) the defence aspect of civil aviation should be referred by the Egyptian Government to the military mission for study with a view to the ultimate elaboration by the Higher Defence Council of a long-term policy; (b) that steps should be taken to ensure that those shares of Misr Airwork which could technically be held bv foreigners were not taken up by foreign interests other than British; (e) that His Majesty’s Government and the Egyptian Government should encourage direct discussions between Misr Airwork and Imperial Airways with the object of working out under governmental auspices some form of collaboration and renunciation of * competition between the two companies. zzo. 1 J 1 ‘g ie following montn conversations took place in London between lalaat Harb I asha and representatives of Imperial Airways. The Egyptian overnment had intimated to lalaat Harb Pasha that collaboration between the two companies would be welcome to them, and the discussions were undoubtedly of value in removing a good deal of the misunderstanding which had attended the ewfnAr 7 en Mr ; T mtz and Talaat Harb Pasha in March and in fhonlh g Tn h l a J a &amp; f0 K |, ve ' tual co-operation. No positive result was arrived at, Fm-nltf 1 , al1 Pasha suggested that if and when external services from Egypt to some European country were contemplated the two companies mio-ht co-operate by forming together a new company for this particular purpose In t was e rar m thit e h a e P f: a , r d d t0 'f ^ f ° r ‘o-operation oi 1 , minor malteTthougE Ictivftlef and -T- keepiI l g the , existin g company with its internal SStSKr,!? o ' &gt;,&gt; “‘ 1 • h - “ i ”“ all events temporarilv sfaXeTtikeAiA^A^lr^ 1011 faoilities was at informed the (Seman wS tW ilT JAP tlan Ministry for Foreign Affairs studied by the E^vDtialfllOTprnnien^ 6 !^!! 0 *^ q ! leStlo ?. of civil aviation was being study no applications for new services co^d be granted! 8 C0m P letl0n of this in re'ality be^g^^^^ the situation was aviation was proving beyond the capacity of the Mfnftfy of 'Snicltflns!where the Director-General of Civil Aviation had long had to wrestle with unending difficulties without the aid of a competent staff. He pressed constantly for an official to co-ordinate air radio, and particularly direction-finding com munications, tor measures to make the meteorological services efficient and for British control officers at civil air ports until Egyptian officials could be properly trained to take their place These recommendations met with constant obstruc- tion from the Peimanent Under-Secretary in the Ministry, and from the Deputy Director of Civ!! Aviation, Roushdy Bey, whose actions as the year went on were only explicable on the assumption that he was aiming at dispensing entirely with British assistance in civil aviation. In July the Director-General of Civil Aviation had called a meeting of the representatives of the operating companies to discuss the whole question of organisation, but in spite of the support which he obtained from this meeting he still found it impossible to get his recom mendations adopted. 228. Another main difficulty had arisen over the subsidy payable by the Egyptian Government to Misr Airwork. The amount due, not only for the current year, but for 1936, was unpaid and in dispute. This was partly owing to delay on the part of the company in supplying the necessary figures, but partly also to conflicting interpretations in the Ministry of Communications as to the basis on which the subsidy rested. After much labour and again in the face of a good deal of obstruction in the Ministry, the Director-General of Civil Aviation eventually succeeded in arriving at agreed figures, only to find the Ministry of Finance unwilling to provide for both the 1937 and the 1936 subsidy in the budget for the year 1937-38. Before he went on leave in August, Group Captain Bone secured the authorisation of his Minister for the payment of the 1936 subsidy, and the matter seemed to be, as far as possible, satisfactorily settled. But shortly afterwards Nokrashy Pasha was dropped from the Cabinet, and Group Captain Bone found on his return from leave in October that the subsidy had not yet been paid, the new Minister of Communications having been led to believe that Nokrashy Pasha had not in fact given the necessary authorisation. The subsidy was being attacked by the Under-Secretary as extravagant, and not in accordance with the company’s authorisation, and Roushdy Bey had been entrusted by the new Minister with the task of drawing up fresh figures. The position was com plicated by personal and political differences, and the attack on the subsidy was evidently part of a campaign to discredit and secure the removal of the British Director-General of Civil Aviation. 229. The non-payment of the subsidy, coupled with the atmosphere of uncertainty as to the future of Misr Airwork, which had been created by irresponsible talk of total Egyptianisation, had produced a serious situation in Misr Airwork itself, where Mr. Maxwell, the competent British technical adviser, was having difficulty in holding the British pilots and engineers. If they decided to seek employment elsewhere, it was quite clear that Misr would be faced with the alternatives either of going out of business or seeking other foreign technical personnel which no doubt the Germans would have been only too glad to supply. The facts, therefore, that Airwork Heston were disinclined to increase their holding in Misr Airwork even if a projected increase of capital reduced their share to less than 10 per cent, of the total, and that, whatever Talaat Harb Pasha’s personal inclinations, no guarantee had yet been obtained against foreign capital bein° &gt; introduced into Misr Airwork, made the situation serious. Moreover, the Germans were renewing their efforts to obtain facilities in Egypt, this time under the guise of an application from a Greek company, which everything pointed to being German in all but name. Owing to political preoccupations, it had been quite impossible to interest the Egyptian Government and further m civil aviation, and no effect had so far been given to the recommendation m our aide- memoire of the 28th July that the question should be referred to the military mission for study from the military angle. 230 On broad political ground, the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards' facilities for the Germans had meanwhile undergone a change. The original object in trying to block the German application for a service to Egyp with an eventual extension eastwards was to avert the possibility of a subsequent request from the Germans for facilities in India. His Majesty s Government, how- evef,tad come to the conclusion that it might be better policy not to try to excludethe Germans from India. Indeed, facilities in India had been privately and tentatively offered to the German Government in view of the ill-success which had attended the German trial flights through Central Asia, and m a telegram of the 2nd December the Foreign Office instructed the Ambassador to inform the Egyptian Government that his Majesty’s Government now saw no objection to the grant of facilities in Egypt to the Germans on the assumption that these facilities were required for a through service to the Ear East. This telegram was in reply to a despatch which the Ambassador had sent home on the 13th JNiovember reporting an indirect approach by the German Minister. The latter, still most anxious to obtain aviation facilities in Egypt, had made a suggestion to the head of the military mission that there should be a gentlemen’s agreement whereby he would guarantee to keep German firms from endeavouring to sell war material to Egypt if the German application for flying facilities was granted. The Ambassador discussed the advantages and disadvantages of blocking this form of German enterprise in the light of the possibility that its objective might be south wards rather than eastwards and passed on the views of the Director-General of Civil Aviation, who, while in principle opposed to blocking any air line application, yet felt it undesirable that German aviation should obtain any sort of foothold in Egypt before the British position was adequately safeguarded. Group Captain Bone, therefore, considered it advisable to keep up delaying tactics, if possible, until— (a) There was some assurance that foreign capital, other than British, would not be admitted to Misr Airwork; and (b) Further progress had been made with the proposed link-up between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork. 231. The Foreign Office instructions regarding the communication to be made to the Egyptian Government about a German transit service to the Ear East, came simultaneously with instructions to approach the Egyptian Govern ment for their views on the proposed extension to Egypt of a Greek air service under German auspices, and a request for the Ambassador’s views as to the attitude to be adopted towards applications from foreign air lines for facilities in Gypi us in the light of the fact that negotiations were still proceeding between Misr Airwork and the Cyprus Government for an air mail contract. ^ rurtner meeting between the Ambassador, the General Officer Com- manding, the Air Officer Commanding and the Chief of the Military Mission was held on the 14th December to consider the position in the light of theso The r etl ? g yok “Ote of the facts that no progress had been made- on the Egyptian side with the formulation of a long-term policy and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to deal with German and otheT’foreign appllca- at a route e b V10 s e o„k \ WaS i™ 1 ^ f hat the Germans “^fbe —S at a route to feouth Africa rather than the Ear East, with political obiectives to N^has Pasha 4 wi t P h r ° P0Sed “S e . to th ?

In reporting this to the Foreign Office on the 17th December the Ambassador added that the meeting was unanimously of the opinion that before making any communication to the Egyptian Government regarding the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards a German transit service or enquiring their views regarding the proposed Greek service, it was essential to know how far His Majesty’s Government were prepared to go in maintaining the British interest in Misr Airwork and in bringing about a link-up between Misr Airwork and Imperial Airways. Unless His Majesty’s Government were prepared to maintain this interest, to press for a guarantee for the exclusion of foreign capital and personnel and to help to develop and extend Misr Airwork through the agency of Imperial Airways or some other British concern, it seemed futile to continue the attempt to exclude foreign influence. It was, however, difficult to believe that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to see civil aviation in Egypt fall into the hands of foreign interests whose influence might spread into other channels and contribute materially to under mining our whole position in Egypt. The Ambassador therefore urged His Majesty’s Government to consider :— (a) Whether by some form of subsidy to Airwork Heston His Majesty’s Government could not find means to maintain the British capital interest in Misr at 10 per cent, if not to increase it. (b) Whether a scheme could not be worked out for submission by Imperial Airways to Misr Airwork for the renunciation of competition between the two services on certain lines, e.g., Cyprus, Palestine and Iraq, and for technical co-operation on these lines and in Egypt; and for the formation with the minimum of delay by the two companies, aided by their respective Governments, of a third company for the operation of an Egypt-Europe service. 235. These proposals were referred at the instance of the Foreign Office to the Interdepartmental Committee on International Air Communications, known as the Warren Fisher Committee, by which body they were still under con sideration at the end of the year. 236 Meanwhile Misr Airwork had taken their grievances to the Ministry of Finance and matters began to clear up in this respect with the intervention of Amin Osman Pasha, then Under-Secretary at the Ministry, and, m addition, Nahas Pasha's right-hand man. Amm Osman Pasha held meetings with repre sentatives of Misr Airwork which, though primarily devoted to the dispute about the subsidy, covered the whole question of organisation m view of the company s concern at the failure of the Government to give effect to the pirector-General of Civil Aviation’s recommendations for adequate technical facilities. Orabi the Minister of Communications who had suceeded Nokrashy Pasha, though at first indignant at this intervention, was eventually brought into line and agreed both to Group Captain Bone’s recommendations as regards technical staff an’TaLoto the payment of the 1936 subsidy to Misr A-workm accordance with the figures worked out by Group Captain Bo e. r f q nnav-nected denouement taken place when the Nahas Government leii. Fortunately however, pavment of the 1936 subsidy had been made immediately beTorTtrGovTrnmentk-fall, aud this, plus thTMt Jh —1 in MGr Airwork to grant certain increases m salary to the British personnel i the company, settlfd the immediate problems of Misr Airwork and produced a better atmosphere. 917 It was unfortunately clear from the attitude of Eoushdy Bey that 237. It was Contain Bone’s recommendations regarding technical the opposition to Group Captain to Mini , and that the who l e of this personnel would be revived under , in J’ novo . Something, however, particular questiwi would have^to b f b g Muntz had suggested t 0 the had been achieved and a t TTfAru y'mrnrp Air Mail Services shouldof Misr Airwork was in process of evolving a concrete but more comprehensive scheme for co-operation between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork. i here was thus ground for hope that real progress might be made in this direction in 1938. 238. Empire Air Mail Scheme .—It is to 1938 also that belongs the effective participation of Egypt in the Empire Air Mail scheme. But it was in 1937 that she agreed to participate. 239. In a note of the 4th March, 1937, the Ambassador recalled the invita tion which had been extended to Egypt in May 1935 to participate in the scheme and recapitulated the suggested conditions of such participation, namely, that Egypt should pay an annual postal contribution of £22,500 for a period of fifteen years, and in addition to the continued refund to Imperial Airways of the duty on petrol and oil taken on board in Egypt and exported to other countries, a contribution to the working expenses equivalent to the landing and housing fees payable by the operating company and estimated at not more than £2,500 per annum. The note explained that for technical reasons the service would only be partially in operation for some time, but pressed the Egyptian Govern ment for an early decision in principle of their willingness to participate. 240. In a further note on the 15th May the Ambassador explained that the original invitation to Egypt had been on a basis of seven or possibly eight services a week in each direction passing through Egypt. The service to South Africa would open in June with three services only, but it was hoped that the services to India and Australia would be extended in such a manner as to provide early in 1938 the necessary number of services to carry all first-class mail to and from Egypt in accordance with the-offer made to the Egyptian Government. r. T ^ e E ffyP tian Government felt it necessary to have Parliamentary sanction for an arrangement involving payments over' fifteen years, and a law was therefore put through Parliament and promulgated on the 3rd July.

Owing to the filling of the reservoirs at Gebel Aulia and Assouan, the levels in the Lower Nile at certain periods of the year will be lower than in the past, while the original, or even higher, levels must be maintained up-stream of the barrages for the needs of cultivation. This involves a greater pressure on the barrage structures, which will be provided for by the work now in progress. The requirements of navigation will be met by a reconditioning of the existing locks. 248. Preliminary work on the new barrages (to be named the Mohamed Ali barrages) which are to replace the seventy-year-old Delta barrage near Cairo has been in progress for some months. The work, which will take some four years to complete and will cost some £2| million, is being carried out by Messrs. Macdonald, Gibbs and Co. (Engineers) (Limited). Drug Traffic. 249. If the quantities of illicit drugs seized in Egypt during 1937 may be taken as indicative of the quantity imported, the outstanding features of the trend of the trade during the year were: (a) the practical non-existence of imported cocaine; (b) a falling off in the imports of heroin; (c) an increase in imported hashish; and (d) a big increase in imported opium. 250. In the majority of seizures it is impossible for the officials of the special bureau established by the Egyptian Government to combat the drug traffic to prove the country of origin of the drugs, the original packings having been almost invariably removed. The hope that chemical analysis might prove it possible to differentiate between Syrian and Turkish hashish proved illusory. 251. A few seizures have been made of hashish of confessed Indian origin and an occasional opium seizure of Chinese origin. Most of the imported heroin, opium and hashish is reported to have come from the Balkans, largely by way of Syria. 252. During 1937 no seizures have been made of heroin of proved Chinese origin, and it seems probable that the export of heroin from China has ceased for the time being, owing to the dislocation of communications. 253. During the past year the Anti-Narcotics Bureau has located in Upper Egypt and destroyed 42,450 hashish plants and 5^ feddans of opium poppy. 254. It is to be anticipated that with the gradual elimination of the European element in the Central Narcotics Intelligence Bureau and the police in general the international and most important side of the bureau s work will suffer. Suez Canal. 255. The agreement reached between the Egyptian Government and the Suez Canal Company, referred to in paragraph 358 of the annual report for 1936, was promulgated by Law No. 73 of 1937 published in the Journal off ciel No. 73 of the 9th August,''1937. Certain important modifications were introduced into the original agreement (King Euad’s signature of which, a few hours before his death, had later been repudiated by the Wafd Government), and the main provisions of the agreement in its final form were: {a) The company agreed to appoint an Egyptian director on the board of the company to fill the existing vacancy. {b) They also agreed to the appointment of a second Egyptian director tc fill the next French vacancy to occur. (c) In any future increase m the total number of dnectors, the company agreed that one of the seats thus created should be reserved for an Egyptian national.) * I (d) The company agreed to pay an annual sum of £E. 300 000 to the Egyptian' Government. (In the original agreement this annual payment had been fixed at £E. 200,000.) in i t’ (e) The company to undertake the construction of a road m the banal Zone, under the provisions of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, at a cost not exceeding £E. 300,000. . qq (/) The company to increase the percentage of its Egyptian stall to 66 per cent. (In the original agreement 25 per cent, had been agreed upon.) 256. The first Egyptian director to be appointed under section (a) of the agreement was Sherif Sabry Pasha. Up to the end of 1937 the second Egyptian director referred to in section (5) had not been appointed. 257. The same law also approved the agreement dated the 2nd May, 1936, regarding various matters relating to the non-taxation of motor vehicles owned by the company, the passage of Egyptian Government vessels through the Canal, road improvements, customs dues, the cost of certain municipal services, water allowance, land exchanges with the Egyptian State Railways, the north-western inner basin at Port Said, concessionary lands of the company to the east of Port Fuad, and the maintenance of all previous conventions and agreements in all points where not affected by the new agreement. 258. The Canal dues were reduced as follows with effect from the 1 st April, 1937 : — For loaded vessels : From 7s. to 65 ., or PT. 29-25 per ton. For vessels in ballast: From 3s. Qd. to 35 ., or PT. 14-625 per ton. For passengers : From 125. id. to 65 . per passenger. (Children pay one-half of this rate.) Pilgrimage. 259. As a result of the settlement of the long outstanding questions between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the former practice of sending the Mahmal to Jedda and the despatch of the Kiswa to Mecca was resumed in 1937. Maitre Mahmoud Bassiouni, then President of the Senate, was appointed Emir-el-Hag, and a sum of nearly £E. 34,000 was voted by Parliament to defray the expenses involved. 260 The number of Egyptians making the pilgrimage was 9,667 as compared with 5,301 m 1936, and they were transported to Jedda by the Misr Navigation Company. The International Quarantine Board declared the pilgrimage clean.

On the 30th August a reply was sent to the president of the association on instructions from the Foreign Office, that the question of the Alexandria Municipality had not been a -suitable one for discussion at the Montreux Con ference. His Majesty’s Government would, however, do their utmost to safeguard the foreign officials of the municipality, but in the absence of any positive indica tion of the intentions of the Egyptian Government in the matter, it was not then possible for His Majesty’s Government to reach any conclusion as to their own attitude. At the same time His Majesty’s Government felt that the foreign officials should recognise that, while in certain conditions compensation would be justified, it was extremely improbable that any such compensation would be actually on the basis of Law No. 28 of 1923. The Societe Radio Orient. 265. In January the Foreign Office instructed the Ambassador to support strongly the representations made to the Egyptian Government by the Marconi Company of Egypt for the indefinite suspension of the Radio Orient Company’s operations in Egypt. No action was taken immediately, as it appeared that the Minister of Communications, Nokrashi Pasha, was coming round to the view that Radio Orient was best out of the way. At the beginning of March, however, it was learnt that the French Minister'had been making strong representations to the Egyptian Government, and a memorandum was accordingly handed by the Ambassador to the Prime Minister urging that there was no reason for the Egyptian Government to agree to the reinstatement of the company and that the Egyptian Government had nothing to fear from arbitration, to which the French Government threatened to have recourse. Immediately after this, Nokrashi Pasha stated definitely that the French Minister would be offered arbitration. Subse quently however, the Egvptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Bedawi Pasha, who was apparently anxious about the French attitude at Montreux, began to put pressure on Nokrashi Pasha to reinstate the company on terms designed to prevent the recurrence of the practices which had led to its suspension the Ambassador accordingly enquired of the Foreign Office as to what lengths he should go m urging the Egyptian Government to resist French pressure the Foreign Office again gave instructions that the Marconi Company should be strongly supported m p’reSng for arbitration and Mr. Smart accordingly told the Prime Minister that it seemed unbelievable that the Egyptian Government should contemplate a complete surrender of their position in this matter for fear of political reactions. The Ambassador reinforced these representations m a conversation with the Prune Minister who said that he had given precise, instructions to the Minister o± Communications that if the French pressed again for a settlement, they should be informed that the Egyptian Government were quite prepared to take the matter to arbitration Early in April the Ministry for Foreign Aft airs informed the Minister that the Egvptian Government accepted the French demand for “a£ldh“dS arbitration should be conducted by nommees of a Government or Governments. There were no further developments until late in September, when the v nnh Minister informed the Egyptian Government that the High Commissioner French Minister imormeu Tarvminaterl the Norwegian Government as for Syria and the Rtte' tjan Government to nominate another arbitrator, arbitrators and ykffin^Tondon advised Mr. Webb to secure the nomination of The General Post Office, Pf.y^Cy^bitrator, and this was accordingly done. •*. &gt;«-* &lt;• *»*•niBHT 54 stated that, in the view of the Egyptian Government, the question for arbitration was not concerned with the facts of the case or with the justification tor e suspension of Radio Orient, but only with the question whether suspensions ot this kind could be of indefinite length or must have a maximum duration, and, at the same time, suggested that the decision of the arbitrators might be postponed until the forthcoming Tele-Communications Conference had given a general opinion on the point. This note was apparently drafted by Bedawi Pasha without consulting the Post and Telegraphs Administration. No reply had been received by the end of the year. Chapter VI.—British Education and Culture in Egypt. 267. The principal development in the sphere of Anglo-Egyptian cultural relations in 1937 was the foundation early in the year of the Anglo-Egyptian Union. This society was the result in the first place of Egyptian initiative, and the Egyptian Government made a contribution of £E. 3,000 towards its foundation. The British Council provided a further £2,000, and the Egyptian State Domains agreed to lease the bungalow in the garden of the Sirdaria at a rental of £E. 50 a month as premises for the club. This building was pleasantly furnished and proved most convenient and suitable for the purpose. A sum of £700 was set aside for the foundation of a library, and a start was made during the year in the purchase of books in London through the British Council. 268. A strong Anglo-Egyptian committee was formed under the chairmanship of Sir Edward Cook and the vice-chairmanship of Abdel Wahab Pasha. The club’s activities started with a reading and commentary on English poetry by Mr. C. Scaife of the Egyptian University, and was followed by a series of lectures in November and December on subjects including the Egyptian drama and the Egyptian film. The first of a series of informal receptions for distinguished guests was arranged for Professor Lascelles Abercrombie on the 14th December, when he gave a reading from his works and led a discussion afterwards. In addition to these meetings, an attempt was made to foster the social side of the club, and already Egyptians and Englishmen began to use the club in the evenings for meeting each other and making useful contacts. British GounciVs Expenditure in Egypt. 269. Lord Lloyd paid a second visit to Egypt, in connexion with the work of the British Council, in 1937, accompanied by Mr. K. R. Johnstone of the Foreign Office. As a result of this visit grants totalling £16,400 were approved for expenditure in Egypt during the financial year 1937—38. These were as follows :—■ Capital. (1) English school, Cairo— Allowance to headmaster ... (2) English school, Cairo— Supplement to staff salaries (3) Anglo-Egyptian Union (4) Maltese school, Suez— Annual grant (5) Maltese school, Suez-^ Repayment of debt (6) Maltese school, Suez—■ Increase in salaries (7) Maltese school, Suez— New English teacher (8) Maltese school, Suez— Library (9) Maltese school, Suez— Playing field (10) Maltese school, Port Said (11) Scottish boys’ school, Alexandria- Budding fund £ 500 A nnual. £ 200 400 2,000 1,000 140 50 2,000 50 280 80 2,000■ €5 vJt (12) British boys’ school, Alexandria School hall ...

(16) Lecturer for Greece and Egypt Joint total: £16,400... English School, Cairo. u Progress was made throughout 1937 with the construction of the new buildings of the English school, Cairo, and arrangements were made for the foundation stone to be laid by Lord Lloyd early in 1938. In succession to Mr. Grose, the school council selected Mr. C. B. Owen, assistant master at Malvin College, as headmaster. The school continued to prosper in spite of the disastrous loss of Mr. Grose, and at the end of the year the finances were under stood to be on a satisfactory basis. British Boys’ School, A lexandria. 271. This school continued to be full to overflowing. Admission had to be refused to over 200 applicants during the summer vacation. Work was begun in September on the construction of a new school hall to which the British Council had granted the sum of £5,000. The premises include the hall, library, staff common-room, changing room, typewriting class-room, boy scouts’ room, cinema cabin and store-rooms. The hall itself is to be utilised for physical training, art, singing and examinations, and it is expected to be greatly to the advantage of the discipline and tone of the school. English Girls’ College, Alexandria. 272. This school showed further expansion during the year. Pupils increased from 100 in 1936 to 150 in 1937, and the staff from 8 resident and 10 non-resident mistresses to 14 resident staff from England and 11 non-resident. 273. The new permanent buildings designed by Mr. G. Wornum, F.R.I.B.A., were in the course of erection during the school year, while the college continued to be temporarily housed at Ramleh. Before the end of the year, however, the kindergarten portion of the college, together with some boaideis, was tiansfeired to the kindergarten wing of the new building. 274 The total sum required for completing the buildings and providing a £10 000’reserve fund and £6,000 to meet the first year’s deficit was reckoned at £92000 Before the end of 1937 some £80,000 towards this sum had been collected of which £20,000 was a contribution by His Majesty s Government. British School, Port Said. 275 The decision of the British Council to make the grants mentioned above to the British school at Port Said enabled negotiations to be started m 1937 toi he acquisition of a suitable site for the school. After long discussions the Egyptian Government agreed to lease the buildings of the Ports and Lighthouses Administration for this purpose. The rent originally suggested was £E. 372, but infOTinaf assurances were eventually obtained from the Prime Minister. Nahas mloimal assura re duced by 50 per cent, as a special contribution by the Egyptian^overnment towardsThe cost of the school. A the close of the year tW negotiations had not yet been completed, but a managing c(mimittee had Wn formed and Mr Keyring, an assistant master at the British Boys behoof, been toimea, ana mi xxcyi fei made with the necessary Alexandria, selected as headmas . 7 x ip-vahouses’ building and it was alterations and repairs to the Ports and L^thouses^ “ng, g ^ ^ had noSow^ver been signJd by. the end of the year, nor the proposed reduction in rent definitely agreed to m writing.The A mbassador’s A dvisory Committee. 276 The committee continued its work throughout the year undei t e chairmanship of Sir Robert Greg. It was engaged towards the end of the .year in formulating extensive proposals for expenditure on cultural and educational work during the year 1938. Chapter VII.— -The Egyptian Press. 277 The efforts inaugurated at the beginning of 1936 to strengthen contacts with the press with a view to counteracting the activities of hostile foreign influences were maintained and developed. Not only were journalists of all categories encouraged to visit the Embassy, but special inducements were offered in certain cases for them to propagate a specific current of opinion. 278. During the course of the summer proprietors and editors of the leading papers were afforded an opportunity of visiting the United Kingdom in a conducted party. The programme of the tour was arranged with the view to inspiring them with respect and admiration for British institutions, and the stability, prosperity and strength of the British Empire. With the co-operation of the service departments they visited Portsmouth Dockyard, the Royal Air Force at Northolt and the army at Aldershot, and were also given an insight into the industrial activity of Lancashire and the Midlands. Judging from the numerous articles which were produced in the local press, and conversations with those who took part in the tour, the results amply justified the trouble and expense. The editor-in-chief of the leading newspaper Ahram, who had never previously visited England, gave a remarkably interesting lecture on his experiences on his return to Cairo. Another member of the party contributed a talk from the local wireless station. 279. The efforts of the Italians to suborn the press with various devices continued unabated. It would appear that they had not at their disposal the same ample funds which permitted them to control the editorial policy of the Ahram for a short time during 1936. Nevertheless, they were able from time to time to introduce in certain papers—particularly in the Opposition press—the suggestion that Egypt in associating herself in an alliance with Great Britain had become a potential protagonist in a European conflict with which, in other circumstances, she would not be concerned. Towards the close of the year the Italian press in Italy made common cause with the opponents of Nahas Pasha, and foimulated the thesis that Nahas Pasha had bound himself hand and foot to the British chariot to the ultimate destruction of Egypt’s independence. Drawing compansons with the specious adulation which the Italian press had showered on the Ward earlier in the year, the Government press reacted with violent attacks against Italy and this clumsy attempt to disparage Great Britain at the expense of the Wafd could hardly be claimed to have achieved its object. Fo- 2 f 80 ‘ A r , more P rofitab le field for Italian endeavour than the arena of Egyptian politics was the situation m Palestine.

During the actual negotiations at Montreux this note was admirably maintained, and in the words of the Ahram, whose proprietor himself was directing that paper’s policy from Montreux' “ there is one reassuring factor : John Bull is our ally.” 283. The first intimation that a conflict was afoot between the Palace and Nahas Pasha as to the religious aspect of King Farouk’s investiture appeared in the A hram, probably at the inspiration of Prince Mohamed Aly. The idea of a religous ceremony was warmly supported by the Balagh and equally vehemently opposed by the Wafdist press. It became^ in fact, a major issue, in which it was abundantly clear that the Government were determined to affirm the principle, that the King derived his power from Parliament—and the Misri specified a Wafdist Parliament—and not from an ecclesiastical authority. 284. At about the same time there was a distinct tendency in the Opposition press—notably the Balagh and the Rose-el-Youssef- —to associate their criticism of the Government with the latter’s subservience to the English. This movement was particularly conspicuous in the discussion regarding £ £ The King of Egypt and the Sudan” as the Royal title, and the alleged lack of interest on the part of the Government in the situation in Palestine. 285. The changes introduced in the personnel of the Cabinet—the departure of Nokrashi Pasha and Mahmoud Ghaleb Pasha^—on the occasion of the King’s accession created violent polemics between the Wafdist and Opposition press, in which the A hr am was inclined to si-de with the latter. 286. The press in general expressed great satisfaction with a statement made at Geneva in September by Wacyf Ghali Pasha, Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the situation in Palestine. It was taken as a tangible sign of Egypt s independence and as an earnest of her devotion to the Arab cause. 287. An article in the Observer in October, which suggested that Nahas Pasha was jealous of the King’s popularity and had visions of becoming a dictator himself, raised a chorus of disapproval in the Government press, but was hailed with delight by the Opposition. At about the same time the tours which iN alias Pasha was making in the provinces were the subject of mordant comment m the Balagh and Rose-el-Youssef. 288. Thus by the end of November the Opposition press had made it perfectly clear that relations between Palace and Cabinet were extremely strame At this juncture the A hram, in referring to the appointment of Aly Maher Pasha advised' the British ally not to intervene m a purely Egyptian concern, noi to exploit the treaty to gain new privileges. 289 Towards the middle of December an article in the Daily Telegraph revealiL the main issues of the conflict between King and Government, and insinuating that the latter was endeavouring to enlist the support of the army coupled with a telegram from Reuter's correspondent in Cairo, alleging that Nahas Pasha would shortly be dismissed, precipitated the crisis which ended the formation 'of'the new Government under Mohamed Mahmoud. oqo Hnfiner the period under review the Akram, Egypt s leading ne ' v&amp; “ 29 °' b f rlfsti net deuarture from its traditional policy of supporting the - AoVNotohy fariras opportunity to take his columns of the Ahram.

The Mokattam was conducted on lines of extreme parsimony, and the fact that it was apt to fill its columns with telegrams from Italian and other agencies—the editor-in-chief turning a blind eye—suggested that certain members of its staff were not immune from the temptation to augment their exiguous salaries with Italian money. Its excessive subservience to the blandishments of the Press Bureau were particularly noticeable. On several occasions the Mokattam was excluded from Palestine. 292. The Jehad, which started the year as the main Wafdist organ of old- established repute, observed with growing resentment the encroachments of the Misri, which was founded in September 1936. The generous treatment the latter was accorded by the Press Bureau, both in cash and information, so incensed its proprietor that he decided to go into Opposition. After indulging for about a month in a campaign against the venality of Nahas, which rivalled that of the Balagh in intensity and violence, Tewfik Diah suddenly altered his tone and reverted to the Wafd. On both occasions he explained to his readers his change of front by a story that he was acting on “divine inspiration.' In reality, he was actuated by considerations of finance. This paper also was banned from Palestine in the course of the year, but at times it was definitely anti-Italian. The Embassy’s relations with the proprietor continued to be friendly. 293. The Kawkab-esh-Sharq remained consistently Wafdist, but slightly more “nationalistic” in its views of the treaty than the other organs of the Government press. It remained the champion of the Blueshirts, and was particularly violent in its criticism of Dr. Ahmed Maher. It was not, however, anti-British and gave considerable prominence to a series of excellent articles from its representative in the journalists’ tour of Great Britain. Its proprietor, Hafez Bey Awad, continued to be friendly in his personal relations with the Embassy. 294. The Balagh remained the principal organ of the Opposition and contributed to an important extent in the final discomfiture of the Nahas Administration, and the apparent equanimity with which the Cabinet’s dismissal was accepted by public opinion. A special understanding which its proprietor, Abdel Kader Hamza, had made with the Embassy terminated shortly after the Montreux Convention, when the paper entered into a special arrange ment with Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha. The latter paid the salary of Abbas-el- Akkad, an extremely able journalist, whose articles were a source of considerable annoyance to the Government and the subject of numerous legal proceedings and suppressions. 295. There were the clearest indications from items of news which could only be known to the Palace and were published exclusively in this organ that the Batagh was in the closest contact with Royal circles. 29b As regards its attitude towards the heavy commitments of the military rhe U n e irt 0 nf h n e “TjT’ ltS alle f? tion T s ^at the Egyptian army was destined to plai the part of a labour corps to the British, and the excessive hold the militar mission was gaming on the Wafdist Minister of War, the Balagh constituted ) BritisVa n S d anti STV emen V W , hl 5 h W f not &gt; howev er, so intrinsically anti Embass^continued’to be^frierKlly . 16 a ^ IOnS betWeen AMel Kadei ' Hamza and th ' and 2 the cofferf of s ' bservlent to th e dictates of Makram Pasha Eben Bu ’' eaU - There is rittle doubt Aat one of th mdhXal KaHrt hot t r f eiv \ &amp; . framing fee from the Italians.

There was i if all y thin g- a change for the better in the attitude of the weekly Mussawai so far as British interests were concerned. Although the editor ot his journal, Eikn Abaza, continued personally to profess strong Watanist (nationalist) views, his editorials remained well within the bounds of decency One of the proprietors of the Musmwar, Shukry Zaidan, took part in the join nahsts tour and appeared to have been favourably impressed. The fact that a large proportion of the advertising space in this journal was covered by British nrms was understood to be a deterrent from indulging in views too blatantly anti-British. J -^he Wafclist weekly satirical magazine Aki' Sa’s continued to support the (xovernment whilst, with an occasional lapse, refraining from indulging its satire at British expense. Its editor, Mohamed Tabei, whose mentality previously had a pronounced Socialist tendency, became completely Royalist as a result of his accompanying King Farouk on his European tour. 'The views of the Rose-el-} oussef were distinctly anti-British, but means were found towards the end of the year of tempering its proclivities in this direction. The Lataif-al-Mussawara, a poor imitation of the Musawar, caused no anxiety to the Embassy. Its proprietor, Iskandar Makarius, was very touched with the kindness with which he was treated in England in the course of the journalists’ tour. This friendly feeling was undoubtedly reflected in the tone of his paper. The proprietor of the Kaslikul spent most of the year in prison as a result of a scurrilous article against Nahas and Makram Pashas. His friendly personal contacts with the Embassy could not, therefore, be exploited to the normal extent. 300. The weekly Chabaab, which had previously been edited by Mahmoud Azmi, now an official in the Iraq Government, was taken over by Mohamed Aly Taher, the notorious president of the Syro-Palestine Committee. It became the depository of people with grievances (imaginary and real) against British administration in Palestine, the Hadramaut, and the Persian Gulf. Its circula tion in Egypt was negligible, but it constituted a distinct ‘ nuisance value” outside this country wherever it was allowed to penetrate. 301. With the exception of the Egyptian Gazette, there was no appreciable change in the tone of the European-1 anguage press. The Bourse egyptienne, under the new editorship of M. Jean Lugol, completely discarded its pro-Fascist tendencies, and, always prepared to listen to “directives” from the Embassy, made a feature of boosting the strength of Great Britain and its armed forces. The Re forme and the Patrie continued to be susceptible to Italian influences, whilst the Giornale d’Oriente, without being blatantly anti-British, assiduously reproduced extracts from the Arabic press which happened to oe unfavourable. Articles from its Jerusalem correspondent, Alessandro Mombelli, were unifoim y disparaging to British policy. Q ,0*2 The Eawtizm Mail improved in appearance and subject-matter, and, in the event of another concentration of the British fleet in Egyptian waters, the circulation of this paper would undoubtedly exceed that of the Egyptian Gazette. 303. The Journal d'Egypte continued to extol the benefits of the treaty and the progress of our rearmament programme. qoi 4 ■ i£»w addition to the French dailies was the Ril, edited by the late supporter of the Government.

The Greek papers &lt;u.u relations with the proprietor and’etfitofs *o?ttafEuropean’ianguage journals continued to be friendly. [17725]307 There was no change in the activities of the Italian ne ws agency Ao-ence d’Egypte et d’Orient, which co-operated closely with the Deutsches NachrichtenSiiro. Its bulletins, which frequently contained telegrams reflecting discredit on British colonial administration, continued to be distributed gratis or at a nominal subscription. Their publication was ensured by the mampula- tion of Italian trade advertisements and gratuities to sub-editois of the famous papers. But the tone of the Agence d’Egypte et d’Orient was not so outrageously anti-British as the announcements of the Bari Radio. Otherwise it would have been necessary to take drastic steps. 308. The Deutsches Nachrichten-Biiro, managed by a certain Herr Tietz, a pleasant and inoffensive individual nominally a diplomatic “ attache at the German Legation, was much more “ objective ’’ than that of its Italian associate. 309 Reuter, whose subsidy from the Egyptian Government was the subject of criticism in the Parliamentary Budget Committee, continued to carry impartial news from the British Empire, a fair sprinkling of Greek Government news from Athens, but very little from the Near and Middle East. British official wireless was much appreciated in local press circles. Its sober presentation of reliable news, the accuracy and completeness of its reports on parliamentaiy debates, coupled with the total absence of political bias, rendered this service a valuable asset and a refreshing contrast to the agencies which disseminated propaganda. 310. Of the latter category, no less than three specialised in news from the Near and Middle East, namely the Anba-al-Charkiya (Turkish), the Agence d’Orient (Zionist), and the Orient Arabe (independent with an anti- Italian and pro-British tendency). In co-operation with the Government of India and the Colonial Office, this agency was regularly supplied with creditable items of news concerning Moslem communities throughout the Empire which were reproduced in the press of Egypt, Syria and Iraq. 311. In the course of the year the proprietors and editors of the Balagh, Rose-el-Youssef and Kashkul were prosecuted and punished, and the Young Egypt Society’s organ Sarkha was only permitted to appear spasmodically in the intervals when its editor, Ahmed Hussein, was out of prison. 312. No progress was made in the formation of a Press Association, the statutes of which had been approved by a decree promulgated during the Ali Maher Administration in 1936. Broadcasting. 313. The Egyptian State Broadcasting functioned somewhat lifelessly, its programmes being the subject of frequent press criticism. The news bulletins (mostly Reuters) were of little interest to the local public, though its musical programme appeared to be an attractive feature to the patrons of coffee shops, of which no less that 3,300 are equipped with receiving sets. 314. The Jerusalem station was only slighly appreciated by local listeners-in. It seemed to display the same defects as Cairo and its reception in Egypt was particularly bad. Arrangements were made to supply this station, through the Embassy, with items from Egypt likely to be of interest to the Arab world, and it was hoped that the Jerusalem news bulletins would be considerably improved by this innovation. 315. The most unsatisfactory feature in radio continued to be the broad casts m Arabic from Bari and Rome. The fact that it was generally known that tins service caused considerable misgiving to His Ma j esty ’ s Government contributed, un or unate y to giving it a publicity quite disproportionate to its merits, and wwl .

[J 3522/3322/16] (No. Sir, 906.) Sir M. Lamfson to Mr. Eden.—(Received August 9.) Cairo, July 28, 1937. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the annual report for 1936. During my absence in London in connexion with the treaty negotiations from the 2nd June to the 28th June, 1936, Mr. Kelly was in charge of the Residency as Acting High Commissioner, and during my absence on leave from the 14th August to the 4th November, 1936, Mr. Yencken was in charge from the 15th August to the 22nd August, Mr. Kelly again resuming charge as Acting High Commissioner from the 23rd August to the 3rd November, 1936. 2. The pressure of urgent work arising out of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty settlement, combined with Mr. Yencken’s transfer in January, Mr. Kelly’s absence at Montreux and the disappearance of the Advisers, has, to my regret, made it impossible to complete this report at an earlier date. 3. The declaration of Egyptian independence in 1922 had failed to satisfy Egyptian national aspirations owing to the important qualification of the four reserved points. Many attempts had been made in the intervening years to dispose of these reserved points and place Anglo-Egyptian relations on a more satisfactory permanent basis by a treaty settlement. Repeated failures had determined His Majesty’s Government only to reopen negotiations with a United Front in Egypt and serious prospects of success, and on the understanding that any further failure would leave His Majesty s Government tree to reconsider their whole Egyptian policy. 4. The creation of the United Front, representative of all political parties,, late in 1935 and the menace to Egypt inherent in the Italian campaign in Abyssinia produced an atmosphere in which negotiations could profitably be reopened on the 2nd March. 5 Italian ambitions in Abyssinia and generally in the Mediterranean had concentrated attention on the military problem. Egypt although not a member of the League, had associated herself voluntarily with the sanctions policy of the Leae-ue of Nations and the reinforced Mediterranean Fleet remained until Juh at flexandria The presence of British armed forces m Egypt was, therefore., for the first time obviously as essential to Egypt as to Great Britain and could not be regarded merely as an affront to Egyptian national pride or a means of ^reserving order and protecting foreign interests and nationals m Egypt. The military clauses of the treaty took up most of the attention of the negotiators^ and n l settlement provided that British troops and Royal Aar Force units while moving out of Cairo and Alexandria would remain m the Cana Zone'to ptoto. J 5 9457 [15794] ___ _ i '”AVv- - 'M 24NOV1937 r.2 task of the British forces in defending Egypt against foreign aggression under the terms of the alliance. At the same time, the Egyptian army is to be increased and trained by a British military mission with the object of taking over the complete defence of Egypt from the British army m due course. 6 . The Sudan clauses, on which the negotiations of 1930 had broken down were rapidly settled on a basis of Egyptian acquiescence in the preservation of the status quo with some concessions to Egyptian national feelings, such as the return of Egyptian troops to the Sudan, from which they had been expelled after the mutiny^of 1924. The civil clauses were settled on the basis of previous treaties, it being understood that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would give their whole-hearted support to Egypt in negotiations with the Powers for the abolition of the capitulatory regime. British protection of foreigners and minorities ceased, and the previous responsibility of His Majesty’s Government for the preservation of internal security, &amp;c., has passed to the Egyptian Government, with the proviso that British commandants and a proportion of European officers and constables shall be retained in the police until 1941. 7. The success of the Italian campaign in Abyssinia in the spring and summer of 1936 was undoubtedly a great factor in the conclusion of the negotiations and the signature of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Amity and Alliance in London on the 12th August. Another factor was probably the death of King Fuad on the 28th April, shortly after the opening of the negotiations. Although the King had welcomed His Majesty’s Government’s offer to negotiate and contributed very largely to the formation of the Egyptian treaty delegation on the basis of the United Front, His Majesty’s distrust of the Wafd, who returned to office on the 9th May with a virtually unanimous Parliament behind them, and his natural inclination to continue, as he had done so profitably in the past, to play off Great Britain against the Wafd, and vice versa, would very possibly have induced him to put a spoke in the wheels at the more difficult stages of the negotiations. 8 . King luad’s death, on the other hand, deprived the country at a most critical moment of experienced and stable leadership, coupled with qualities of statesmanship and a wider outlook than that possessed by the majority of Egyptian political leaders. Although the furtherance of His Majesty’s own peisonal interests had always been uppermost in his mind, to the complete destruction of any popularity he might have possessed among his subjects, mg ruad had, nevertheless, on the whole steered a wise course in the ultimate interests of Egypt and, whatever his personal sympathies, he never lost sight of the importance of Anglo-Egyptian co-operation. His death left the throne to an en ne y inexperienced and uneducated, although by no means unintelligent, minor and a Louncil ot Regency whose personal honour and representative capacity were beyond dispute, but none of whom was remarkable for ability or strength of ™™t C l er ‘-P m great P ersonal popularity of the young King Farouk from the authorltf of^theIpalaceTn Egypl^' h ° WeVer ’ t0 ult ™ ate Preservation of the since^lQ^^af ^ s ^inority the Wafd, who had been in the wilderness conduct of thp . an d 18 h ar dly remarkable that their successful Ep-vntian rpRHrmc ^ iatl ? ns aa d the improvement thus effected in Anglo- lowerine- of the ‘dambf A °- n ^^it side by much nepotism and a general lowering of the standards of administration which augured ill for the future. have neve Jbeen so cordla 1 ^ f ne ^ ^ ra A n gl°'Egyptian relations which as an ally and protector agains/tbl ^ a f 0rit X ^SYPUans looked to Great Britain and as a 7 pXK S from and from Abyssinia, making her first indeuendont on 111 ernatlc ! n al stage on which Egypt was now their part, the Egyptian Covprrfm^^n SmC I t ^ e ^ a J s ^e Ptolemys.

A good cotton crop high prices and, generally, a return to the happier economic conditions prevailing: before the world crisis of 1929-30, marked the year 1936. These obvious sign! o± prosperity, coupled with the strong financial position and large reserves of e Egyptian brovernment, went far to balance prophesies of economic and financial disaster as a result of the treaty and Wafd maladministration. • n v 6 tr^ty? which deprives the foreign communities m whose hands the commerce and finances of Egypt have been so largely concentrated, of their previous privileged position, has been accepted by them very calmly and generally with reasonable optimism regarding the future Whether, in the long run, the Egyptian will, in fact, be prepared to shoulder the military and financial burdens which are the ultimate price of independence remains to be seen. 12 . Although the main note running through this report must necessarily be one of change, the Egyptian problem remains unaltered in its essential elements. The three main forces in the country after the treaty as before are the Palace, the Wafd and Great Britain, whether represented by a High Commissioner or an Ambassador. Egyptian opinion still appears tacitly to recognise that neither the Palace nor any Egyptian Government could for long pursue a policy in opposition to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government, and, the stigma of inferior status having been finally removed, both the Palace and the Government will, one may hope, turn spontaneously and increasingly to His Majesty’s repre sentative in Egypt for guidance and advice, which should be none the less effective for being tendered in a less authoritative manner than in the past.

With this object in view they insisted on the immediate formation of a Elmted Front Government either to conduct treaty negotiations before the elections or at least to ensure that the elections were not allowed to result entirely in favour of the Wafd. 2. In reporting on the situation to His Majesty’s Government Sir Miles Lampson considered that such internal intrigues should be disregarded and that the United Front’s letter of the 12th December requesting the resumption of treaty negotiations should be answered strictly on its merits. 3. His Majesty’s Government’s reply to the demand for treaty negotiations was received on the 16th January and was communicated verbally by the High Commissioner to King Fuad on the 19th January and later to the Prime Minister and to Nahas as the representative of the United Front. The reply was to the effect that His Majesty’s Government was ready to resume negotiations at once, but proposed that, as a preliminary to negotiations, the military clauses of the 1930 draft treaty should be discussed confidentially and as potential allies, and if an agreement was reached on the military clauses, the Sudan clauses should next be discussed. The High Commissioner was instructed to impress upon King Fuad and the political leaders that the consequences of failure to reach agreement would be serious, and in such an event His Majesty’s Government might have to reconsider their whole policy towards Egypt. King Fuad was further informed that His Majesty’s Government relied on him to induce a reasonable attitude amongst the political leaders. To this His Majesty was immediately responsive. 4. Nessim s reaction to His Majesty’s Government’s reply was most favourable, and he agreed that he and the United Front should, after due consideration, answer through King Fuad, who as Sovereign was the proper authority to consider this national question. tv January Aly Maher informed the High Commissioner that iAmg Fuad WaS very pleased With His ATa.lf^st.v’e (Gmravnmanl-’c' TTo n-rn’Cid[15794] Governmenl after the forthcoming elections. The Wafd, he said, would not form R o any C^huon Government. The High Commissioner reminded him that tlie British Government s reply was addressed to the United Front, whose views were necessary, and that as the matter was one between Great Britain and Egypt and not between Great Britain and any individual Egyptian party, it was .ncnmbent on King Fuad to exercise his influence and to decide on the best course 1?. e country s interest. Nahas was upset, but agreed that the decision lay with King Fuad. J ^ jPP? High Commissioner saw Aly Maher on the 21 st January and mloimed him of his conversations with Nessim and Nahas. Aly Maher thought that tne United Front should take no decision before the King saw them, and said that the King intended to press Nahas to modify his attitude of monopolistic right to negotiate with the British. The same day Nahas informed the United Front of His Majesty’s Government’s reply. 8 . On the 22nd January King Fuad summoned Nessim and told him that as he had no Parliament to support him he had better resign. Nessim resigned the same afternoon. On the same day King Fuad summoned the United Front for an audience. According to Mohamed Mahmoud, the King informed them that he had welcomed the formation of the United Front and approved the entering into negotiations with Great Britain, and expressed his readiness to use his influence to remove difficulties which might arise during the negotiations. He had asked Nessim to resign so that a Government of the United Front could be formed, and had asked Nahas to accept the premiership of such a Cabinet. 9. Nahas, however, refused to enter a United Front Cabinet. Meanwhile the High Commissioner had not been given any indication of the King’s inten tion to dismiss Nessim with such precipitancy, and tackled Aly Maher on the subject. The latter pleaded that Nessim’s continuation in office reduced any chance of getting Nahas to head a Coalition Government, and the King had been forced to a quick decision in view of Nessim’s intention to stay till the elections in spite of His Majesty’s repeated requests to him to make way for a National Government. 10. The local press was now quoting extensively from the High Commis sioner’s observations to Nahas that in the event of a breakdown of negotiations His Majesty’s Government might be compelled to reconsider their Egyptian policy. This was being interpreted as a £ ‘ threat,” and the High Commissioner caused the press to be informed that the above statement was qualified by an explicit explanation that it was not a threat but a statement of fact, viz., that His Majesty’s Government would be confronted with a new situation. The same explanation was given by the High Commissioner to members of the United Front who raised the point. 11 During the next week Aly Maher did his utmost on behalf of King Fuad to urge the Wafd leaders to accept His Majesty’s invitation to form a Coalition Government. Aly Maher emphasised that a purely Wafd Government was unsuited either to prepare an unbiassed parliamentary election or to conduct treaty negotiations. The Wafd’s inclination now was towards a non-party Government to conduct elections, and after the elections, treaty negotiations by the United Front under a purely Wafd Government. The minority parties objected. The position by the 24th January was still indeterminate. 12 On the 26th January Aly Maher reported that despite his utmost endeavour he had failed to persuade Nahas to come into line. He succeeded only in persuading him to agree to the postponement of elections until May so that the^electoral campaign would not interfere with the treaty conversations. While Aly Maher pursued his attempts to discover a way out of the political impasse, the High Commissioner, with the approval of His Majesty s Government, main tained the attitude that it was for King Fuad and his Ministers to decide on any action to be taken. The Wafd had been given every chance to co-operate and had refused, and should bear the responsibility which King Fuad clearly mtende to place on them. #i • ■ i ■ ■ +-Vw-*t&gt;q wqq rporudescence of studont troubles. 13.

The?e were further riots and mass meetings of the students on the 30th January, when five students were injured. 15. On the 30th January the Wafd at the last minute agreed to the formation of a neutral Cabinet, with Aly Maher Prime Minister, immed e treaty negotiations, and elections to be held on the 2 nd May. A decree was iconori fPo oamcv mT'pmncf furnmutinp* the following* Cabinet. Aly Maher Pasha: Prime Minister, Minister of Interior and for Foreign Affairs.

Hassan Sabri Bey : Minister of Communications and of Commerce and Industry. Ahmed Abdel Wahab Pasha : Minister of Finance. Sadek Wahba Pasha : Minister of Agriculture. Aly Sedky Pasha : Minister of War and Marine. 16. In a statement to the press, Aly Maher declared that he would set himself the task of preparing the ground for negotiations in an atmosphere of peace and union. 17. Further student strikes occurred in Cairo on the 11 th February. To deal with such disturbances Aly Maher instituted a system of special “ educational ” police in plain clothes for action inside the buildings, instructing the State police forces to avoid clashes with the students in the streets. On broader lines he proposed to tackle the student problem by directing student activities into athletics and other sport channels. 18. On the 13th February Aly Maher sent the High Commissioner a copy of a decree appointing the members of the Egyptian Treaty Delegation. They were— Moustapha-el-Nahas Pasha (President).

Meanwhile, the United Front were still at variance over the allotment of parliamentary seats to the various parties in the forthcoming elections. The original offer by the Wafd of a quarter of all the seats to the minorities had been rejected. The United Front met on the 4th March to consider the question, but came to no agreement. The Wafd had now offered fifty-eight out of 215 seats, but this offer was also rejected owing to the inability of the non-Wafdist parties to agree on the distribution of these fifty-eight seats among themselves. Finally, it was decided that all parties should enter the elections independently. Seats were, however, to be reserved for the members of the treaty delegation. 21. The formal opening of the preliminary treaty discussions took place at Zaafaran Palace on the 2nd March, when introductory speeches were delivered by the heads of the two delegations. The proceedings were then adjourned until after the Bairam holiday. The actual discussions began on the 9th March, and frequent meetings were held until the 21st April, when a communique was issued to the effect that the conversations were to be adjourned until after the elections to enable the Egyptian delegates to take part in the electoral campaign. It was added that the conversations had led to satisfactory progress in certain directions. 22. King Fuad’s health, which had not been good for the last three months, began to give cause for serious anxiety towards the middle of April. On the 24th April the King’s condition became critical, and although His Majesty rallied for a short time, there was little hope of his recovery. On the 28th April His Majesty died. He was buried with full military honours on the 30th April and his body was placed in the tomb of his family at the Rifai Mosque A large representative body of senior British officers of the three services took part m the funeral procession. 23. Kinu Fuad was succeeded by his son Farouk, who was proclaimed King on the 28th April The new King, as Prince Farouk, had been pursuing his studies in England and was preparing to enter the Royal Military Academy. hL studies were now, however, abruptly interrupted.

The results in the elections for the Senate on the /th May were. Wata Opposition 14, nominated 53. 27 On the 8 th May the two Houses of Parliament met in Congress to appoint the Regency Council. An agreement had already been reached among the P political leaders as to the composition of the council. The wishes of the late Kin P Fuad in this matter were not yet known, as the names of his nominees were in sealed envelopes which had not yet been opened. These envelopes were now produced in Parliament, and it was found that the King had nominated Adly Yeghen Pasha (who had died in 1933), Tewfik Nessim Pasha and Mahmoud Fakhry Pasha. After the names had been read there was a short adjournment. When the members reassembled the following were elected as Regents . Prince Mohamed Ali. Aziz Izzet Pasha. Sherif Sabry Pasha. The Regents forthwith took the oath before Parliament. 28 When Aly Maher, who during his short tenure of office had shown exceptional initiative and energy and had embarked on an extensive programme of administrative reforms, the greater part of which was, however, allowed to lapse by the succeeding Wafdist Ministry, tendered his Cabinet’s resignation, he stated that his Ministry had completed its task; it had preserved the national unity, prepared the way for the negotiations and for the return of the Constitution, and, finally, owing to the death of King Fuad, undertaken the formation of the Regency Council. 29 Nahas Pasha was immediately requested by the Regency Council to form a Government, and on the next day submitted the following Cabinet:— Moustapha-el-Nahas Pasha : Minister of Interior and Public Health. Wacyf Boutros Ghali Pasha : Minister for Foreign Affairs. Osman Moharram Pasha : Minister of Public Works. Mohamed Safwat Pasha : Minister of Wakfs. Maitre Makram Ebeid : Minister of Finance.

Meanwhile, treaty discussions continued throughout May in spite of interruptions due to the preoccupations of Nahas with internal politics. 35. On the 23rd May the State opening of Parliament took place, and the Speech from the Throne was read by Nahas. It envisaged a very comprehensive programme of reforms and contained a friendly reference to the treaty negotiations. 36. On the 2 nd June the High Commissioner, accompanied by Air Chief Marshal Sir R. Brooke-Popham and Mr. Smart, left for London by air in connexion with the treaty negotiations. They returned to Egypt on the 29th June. 37. Towards the end of June the post of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Palace Affairs wus created. Nahas explained that this replaced the original project for a Ministry of the Palace. Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State were also appointed to the Ministries of Public Health, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs. 38. Another factor of some significance was the growth of the blueshirt organisation. This body of Wafdist young men was first organised in January 1936 as the Wafd’s answer to the greenshirt and other anti-Wafd movements instigated by the Palace or Opposition parties. By the middle of the year the blueshirts were estimated to number several thousands and contained a large working-class element as well as students. Their frequent appearances in public in large bodies armed in some cases with clubs and knives, and their increasingly truculent manner, caused considerable misgiving among the public. 39. Treaty discussions continued until the 24th July, when agreement was reached on the military clauses. The Sudan clause was next discussed and approved on the 1st August, and, finally, the remaining clauses were settled on the 12th August. The delegations then left for England. The treaty was signed in the Locarno Room of the Foreign Office in London on the 26th August. 40. The conclusion of the treaty was received quietly in Egypt, and in the absence in Europe of all the principal actors of the Egyptian political arena, no event of importance occurred until the latter part of the year. There appeared, however, during September and October a growing volume of criticism of the Wafd Government and strenuous efforts were made by various anti-Government elements to organise opposition to the treaty. Relations between the Wafd and Prince Mohamed Aly were also not good, the prince complaining that he was treated as a cypher and that the Wafd were determined to encroach on the prerogatives of the throne, Nahas accusing the prince of fomenting opposition to the treaty. The tension between them was aggravated by a quarrel over the bestowal of certain honours. 41 The Opposition consisted mainly of free-lance politicians such as Allouba Pasha, Ibrashi Pasha, Abboud Pash y^ iss yVaTv® was elements such as the Watamsts and greenshirts, &amp;c. The Liberal party was divided on the treaty issue, the majority appearing to favour opposition. But the party deferred a decision on its future attitude to the treaty until the return of Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha. 42 The opposition to the treaty continued unabated throughout October but its importance was temporarily obscured by the^ return to Egypt^^ ^tfflStrOckbeJand^ere aSed^an offldal reception, and were greeted by on the 13t , , ^ n t p e biggest crowd ever seen m Alexandna. r h i a krHons e m thtir honour continued uftil their departure for Cairo on the mfoctober On arrival in Cairo Nahas and Makram had an immense public welcome, the crowd in the streets being estimated at 600,000.10 43 In spite, however, of this evidence of popularity with the crowd, the two Wafdist leaders continued to lose sympathy among the governing classes^ The chief causes were widespread nepotism by the Wafd and giowing fear of the blueshirts, who were becoming a public nuisance. Nahas and JMakram, when visiting Germany during the summer, were reported to have shown great interest in the Nazi youth organisations, and some anxiety was now felt lest the Waf leaders contemplated organising the blueshirts on Nazi lines with some unconsti tutional end in view. Both Nahas and Makram, however, assured the Acting High Commissioner that the Wafd was not anti-dynastic, but was determined to maintain the Constitution and keep the monarchy in its place. 44 . The Residency returned to Cairo from Alexandria on the 20th October. The High Commissioner returned to Egypt on the 4th November. 45. On the 2nd November Parliament met in an extraordinary session to consider the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. After a long opening speech by Nahas, the treaty was referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee, whose report was submitted to the House on the 11 th November, when the debate commenced. On the 14th November the treaty was approved by 202 votes to 11. The treaty was then passed by the Senate on the 18th November by 109 votes to 7. In England the treaty was approved by the House of Commons on the 24th November, and on the following day by the House of Lords, in both cases without a division. 46. On the 21 st November the State opening of the Egyptian Parliament took place with the usual ceremony. 47. The year drew to an end with evidence of general discontent at the Prime Minister’s shortcomings as a political leader. The more intelligent section of the Wafd began to despair at his conduct of affairs. Nahas’s refusal to decentralise was causing much of the work of Government to be held up, and his many betises and his lack of consideration for others were the cause of much annoyance. His relations with the Residency continued, however, unchanged. On the 19th December he informed the High Commissioner that it was his earnest hope that, after the treaty came into force, he might maintain close contact with the High Commissioner. Sir Miles Lampson welcomed and reciprocated Nahas’s view, declaring that it was essential that on all major matters they should deal direct, and not through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 48. King Earouk returned to Cairo from Montaza on the 19th December. 49. On the 22nd December the instruments of ratification of the Anglo- Egyptian Treaty were exchanged at Cairo. Treaty Negotiations. ^ th G -^ e ^ em ber, 1935, the members of the United Front, under e presi ency of ISahas I asha, had addressed a note to the High Commissioner expressing their desire to conclude a treaty between Great Britain and Egypt On till 'Inli.' t' whlch a g«?ment had been reached in the 1930 negotiations. that h H, 2 B ° M Jan r&gt; ry p e Hlgh Commission er informed Nahas Pasha verbally nefotift ons h it sU TTTf 1 * were ,P^pared to enter into immediate GoTOrnments shonK ted aS ** P re . llmmai 7 to suc h negotiations, the two changed in ernanAl 6 a PP hcatlon the 1930 military terms to the changed international conditions brought about by the Italo-Abyssinian War. emphasised° tU\e U EgypUif G*oUnmeL 7 t that ebrUary ’ “ 'Un A Residenc y ass””C£ rist. ^ ^ ^««»« j.™ .2” a“‘g h .s b ™s g u 3r szsrsr? i -v p “ h *- * delegation as follows * the official ‘ Egyptian treaty Nahas Pasha president (Wafdist).

Hafez Afifi Pasha (Independent). Nokrashy Pasha (Wafdist). Hamdi Seif-el-Nasr Bey (Wafdist). 52. On the 24th February the High Commissioner notified Aly Maher Pasha that he was authorised to engage in conversations on behalf of ^His Majesty’s Government, with Admiral Sir W. Fisher, Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean Fleet, Lieutenant-General Sir G. Weir, General Officer Commanding-in-chief, British Troops in Egypt, Air Chief Marshal Sir R. Brooke-Popham, Air Officer Commanding-in-chief, Royal Air Force, Middle East, Mr. D. V. Kelly, counsellor at the Residency, and Mr. W. A. Smart, oriental secretary at the Residency, to assist him. Sir W. Fisher’s place was taken at most of the meetings by Rear- Admiral Raikes. Amin Osman Bey was appointed secretary to the Egyptian delegation and Mr. H. L. d’A. Hopkinson, first secretary at the Residency, secretary to the British delegation. 53. The formal opening of the conversations took place at Zaafaran Palace on the 2nd March. The first plenary session was held on the 9th March, when the High Commissioner read a long statement on the strategic situation of Egypt in the light of changed conditions, the main feature of which was that, until such time as Egypt was in a position to assume the responsibility of her own defence, Great Britain and Egypt should agree to pool their military forces, with no limitation as to numbers or dispositions. 54. A second plenary meeting was held with the Egyptian delegation on the 16th March, at which the latter read a reply to the British expose, the main object of which was to bring the conversations back into the framework of the 1930 military clauses. It was then arranged that the most convenient way of proceeding would be for the two heads of delegations to meet privately with a view to reaching a solution. 55 . A number of meetings between the heads of delegations, at most of which the three British service advisers and Amin Osman assisted, took place between the 16th March and the 25th April, when the conversations were adjourned over the Egyptian elections. To meet the British demands for unlimited retention of British troops in the Cairo and Alexandria areas, with unrestricted manoeuvring facilities, Nahas offered a number of concessions over the 1930 terms, notably (1) A time limit before the withdrawal of British troops to the Canal Zone. (2) The right to reinforce the troops in the Canal Zone in an apprehended emergency. (3) Extension of training areas in the Canal Zone. (4) Right to hold manoeuvres in the Western Desert. (5) Improved road and rail communications between the Canal Zone and the cities. ( 6 ) Full facilities for training in the air. (7) Assurances in regard to the powers of the military mission. 56. These proposals were referred to His Majesty’s Government for instructions and in the meantime the elections took place resulting m the return of the Wafd with an enormous majority. Nahas Pasha formed a Wafdist Govern ment but the solidarity between members of the pnited Front was fully main lined Instructions not yet having been received from the Foreign Office the meetings of the 5th and 13th May were of an interim character. On the 21 st May instructions arrived from the Foreign Office agreeing to the evacuation of Cairo kit insisting on the retention of troops in Alexandria. Two fresh and fundamental demands were also put forward which threatened a breakdown of fundamental ae the abolition of the time-limit on the presence of BHtish°troops in the Canal Zone, and the claim of His Majesty’s Government to Britisn troop r ;o-hts of both Egypt and Turkey m the defence of the Canal underTheTuez Canal Convention of 1889. The prospects of an immedmte break, [15794]12 to which these demands gave rise when put to Nahas Pasha at a meeting on the 25th May, led to instructions being sent by the Foreign Office to the H 0 missioner to return to London for purposes of consultation. 1 ne Higtx tom missioner, the Air Officer Commanding-in-chief, and the Oriental Secretary arrived in England bv air on the 24th June. After a series of consultations with the Cabinet, the Secretary of State and the Foreign Office, the High Commissioner returned to Cairo on the 30th June, bringing with him a complete draft treaty, including fresh military proposals based on previous suggestions by Nahas 1 asha and Makram Pasha for making permanent the alliance clauses of the treaty, including the right of British troops to return at amy time in the event of an “ apprehended emergency.’ Sufficient progress was made at several meetings to make it desirable for Mr. W. E. Beckett, Second Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, to come out for purposes of drafting. At a meeting on the 6th July it was decided to set up a drafting committee consisting of Sir G. Weir, Sir K Brooke- Popham, Mr. Smart and Mr. Beckett on the one hand, and Makram Pasha, Mohammed Mahmoud Pasha, Hafez Afifi Pasha and Dr. Ahmed Maher on the other. A number of meetings was held and further meetings also took place between the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister. Eventually—and in spite of serious efforts to obstruct on the part of Mohammed Mahmoud Pasha— it proved possible for a plenary session to be held on the 24th July at Zaafaran Palace for the purpose of initialling the military clauses on the general basis of the new Foreign Office draft and embodying the various concessions offered by Nahas and referred to in paragraph 55 above. 57. The Sudan clauses were next tackled, and, with the agreement of Nahas, the Governor-General was asked to come out from England, where he was on leave, to be available for purposes of consultation. Conversations began on the 27th July at the Antoniades Palace, Alexandria. Agreement was reached and the Sudan clauses initialled on the 1st August, the main changes from the 1930 draft proposals being :— (1) Admission on the part of both sides that the primary interest of their administration of the Sudan should be the welfare of the Sudanese. (2) No decision was taken on the vexed question of sovereignty. (3) Suitable Egyptians as well as British to be eligible for civilian posts in the Sudan. (4) Egyptian troops to return to the Sudan as required by the Governor- General for purposes of defence. (5) Egyptian immigration into the Sudan to be unrestricted except for reasons of public order and health. 58. On the 5th August discussions of the Capitulations clauses began. It at once became clear that the Egyptian delegation were united in demanding far more sweeping changes than had been contemplated in 1930—nothing less intact an the immediate disappearance of the Capitulations and the Mixed Courts! ey agreed that this should be brought about by consultation of the Caoitulatorv thrf principle influence’witjfthe’capitulatory 8 PoweJs to getlhem to doSa 10 ^ ^ ^ were initialled at apleiwy Srara X^^ti ATgusf °At a th d ^ ^ 17th August, and the AnMo-Egyptian Trpniv tl0n • Sai H d for Euro P e on the the Foreign Office on the 26th y Auo'iist theVnvnH^ 11 ^ m the .

The only exceptions were to be the staffs of the Financial Adviser, Judicial Adviser and Director-General, European Department, and the British officers and non-commissioned officers in the Egyptian army. 62. The treaty was submitted to the Egyptian Parliament at an extra ordinary session on the 2 nd November, and approved by 203 votes to 11 on the 14th November. It was laid before the British Parliament in the form of a White Paper and debated by the House of Commons on the 24th November, and the House of Lords on the 25th November. It was approved by both Houses without a division. Ratifications were exchanged between the High Commissioner and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Cairo on the 22 nd December. Cyprus. 63. In March the Government of Cyprus sent to Egypt a trade mission, consisting of the Colonial Secretary and the Comptroller of Customs and Inland Revenue, to discuss the means of increasing the trade between the two countries. Notwithstanding the friendly atmosphere in which the negotiations were conducted, and the correspondence which has passed with the Egyptian Govern ment since the mission’s return to Cyprus, no agreement has yet been reached regarding reduction of tariffs. Chapter II.— Relations with Other Countries and the League of Nations. A byssinia. 64. Egypt was closely interested in the Italo-Abyssinian war owing to (1) her geographical proximity and the possible effect of an Italian conquest of Abyssinia upon the sources of the Blue Nile in Lake Tsana, and (2) old historical ties and close relations through the Coptic Church. One or two attempts at mediation were undertaken by leading Egyptian Copts. Italian successes in Abyssinia naturally aroused fear and resentment in Egypt, and an account of the measures taken to meet the Italian menace will be found under the headings “ Italy,” “ Egyptian Army,” and ££ Defence.” Albania. . , 65. Albania, which had hitherto been represented m Egypt by a consui- ueneral stationed in Alexandria, has established a Legation m Cairo.

F TCL71C6 • 67 France is making a great effort to retain her old cultural predominance in Egypt now threatened by the increased use of English, which is the first foreign language ?n the schools and at the Egyptian University. French influence is however predominant in the Departments of Antiquities and Beaux Arts, and at the Arab Museum. In addition, France spends according to the local Temps correspondent, about 10 million francs a year on her schools and other cultural activities in Egypt, and the number of pupils at the French schools is second only to that of pupils of Greek schools. 68 On the 31st August the French Embassy in London raised the question of the appointment of a French military attache in Cairo. This was considered undesirable, as likely to create a precedent for other countries and the Prime Minister, when consulted through Amin Osman Bey, agreed to refuse any request that might come along officially from the French authorities. Germany. 69. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance visited Berlin in August after the signature of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in London. They were made much of, and German decorations were showered upon the Prime Minister and his party. This visit coincided with great German commercial activity m Egypt discussed in the commercial and economic sections of this report. The Baron von Stumm, a former German diplomat, visited Egypt in November and December with a view to establishing joint German-Egyptian industrial concerns. The Germans have also been most active in aviation (see paragraphs 250-255 of this report), in which the new German Minister, the Baron von Wackendorf, has shown great interest. Italy. 70. Relations between Egypt and Italy during the year were, on the surface, entirely correct, but, as the result of the imposition of sanctions the previous autumn and threatening military activities in Libya, they had become, in fact, very strained and remained so during the first six months of the year. The fact that Egypt, although a non-member of the League of Nations, adopted a policy of economic sanctions was particularly resented by the Italian Government and gave rise to intense ill-feeling against Egypt and also against Great Britain, who was held to be responsible for inducing Egypt to take this decision. (See also under “ Sanctions ” below.) 71. The Italian community in Egypt, which numbers (if one includes persons of Italian descent) some 54,800 individuals, is the best organised and the most thoroughly disciplined community in Egypt, and the Egyptian Government were naturally nervous of the course which events might take should hostilities break out in the Eastern Mediterranean, seeing that the number of effectives enrolled in various organisations in the cities and elsewhere was estimated at 7,100, of whom the great majority possessed firearms. 72. Notwithstanding the correct behaviour of the official Italian representa tives m Egypt, the country was subjected to intensive propaganda. One of the principal means used was offensive broadcasts in Arabic from Bari. The Italian Press Agency issued regular bulletins, which claimed that the Italians alone were the true friends of the Moslem world, the Abyssinians, who were led by British officers were mere barbarians with whom no Moslem could have sympathy. The staffs of Italian banks and the officials of the Ala Littoria air line were busy spreading stories among the local population of the decadence of Britain. Egypt, it was urged, had nothing to gam by provoking Italian hostility for the sake of Great Britain, which, for her own purposes, had raised the bogey of Italian aggression. &amp; J15 received rt-nW t f news P a P ers were 1 sub S 1 di S ed and certain journalists were encouraged to Ll P , 1,0 ” 10 ^ 6 P r op a ganda along these lines, while local Jews ment of s Tew?!^ tn P that . the . { tall . a P Government would assist in the establish- at hLbe? r ttlement ^&gt; ssmia ' Promises of employment in Abyssinia '■inifter Pay We T he l d ° Ut t0 young Moslem teachers, but the'Prime mstei promptly gave orders that passport facilities should be refused. nn^Jih There , wa *. am P le evidence to show that the Italian Legation and consulates were inciting students to create trouble by strikes and demonstrations, we 1 authenticated reports were received of arrangements for sabotage, particularly m oil depots and aerodromes, should hostilities break out. 75. Side by side with these activities existed propaganda, both oral and in the press aiming at destroying the hope of the signature of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, this was directed to the opponents of the Wafd and to the Copts. In rru r . umours were spread of Italy’s readiness to sign an anti-aggression pact, which _ it was hoped, by removing Egyptian apprehensions, would stiffen the Egyptian negotiators in their reluctance to sign the military clauses of the treaty. 76. Two cases of espionage were discovered during the sanctions period. In March an employee of the Lloyd Triestino Steamship Company, who had been under observation for a considerable period, was arrested by the Suez Canal police in possession of photographs of Royal Air Force aerodromes in the Canal area. The matter was brought to the notice of the Italian Charge d’Affaires by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the man was deported, to receive, it is rumoured, promotion in the company’s Trieste office. The second case occurred early in November, when a Maltese clerk at Headquarters, British troops in Egypt, with the knowledge of his superiors, handed to an Italian agent, against payment, a document marked “ Secret.” The agent was promptly arrested. The Prime Minister was much incensed and declared that simple deportation would not be regarded as adequate. The Minister for Foreign Affairs talked to the Italian Charge d’Affaires in the same sense, and the agent was sentenced by his consular court to nine months’ imprisonment with “ sursis ” and deported. 77. The actual effect of sanctions upon the trade between Egypt and Italy are shown by the fact that from December 1934 to mid-July last imports from Italy fell from £E. 1,014,269 to £E. 194,618, compared with the same period a year earlier, while Egyptian exports were reduced from £E. 1,440,824 to £E. 375,083. Japan. 78. The development of trade relations between Egypt and Japan resulted in the establishment of a Japanese Legation in Cairo on the 1st January. It still remains under the charge of Mr. Tokuji Amagi, Charge d Affaires, no Minister having been appointed. 79 Negotiations for a commercial convention between the two countries have been suspended. The Egyptian negotiators informed the Japanese that they did not desire to restrict Japanese imports into Egypt either by special duties, by ouotas or otherwise, except in so far as may be necessary (a) to protect Egyptian industries, and (b) to prevent disturbance of Egypt s trade relations with other countries They required, however, that Japan should maintain a fair balance of trade with Egypt. It is understood that the Egyptian Government intend to o-ivp effect to this policy by retaining the existing 40 per cent surcharge on Japanese ^cotton’goods an/to give effect to principle ( 6 ) by admitting other Japanese goods at minimum rates of duty up to the total value of Egyptian exports to Japan during the preceding six months. When this figure is exceeded, maximum rates will be imposed. PolcstlTlG so The unsatisfactory state of affairs obtaining in Palestine during 1936 ° V without its repercussions in Egypt, though the Prime Minister was Tble to keep any violent reactions in the press within bounds by appealing to iournalists not to exacerbate feelings between Great Britain and Egypt whi s treaty negotiations were in progress. ^ [15794]16 81. A certain sum of money was contributed by private subscriptions for remittance to Arab sufferers from the general strike, but it is said that not all the money collected reached its destination. g 2 After the treaty negotiations had been successfully concluded Nahas Pasha offered his services to the British Government as a mediator in the impasse which had arisen in Palestine. Ihis offer was no doubt a perfectly genuine c ) to help His Majesty’s Government, inspired by a desire to assist Egypt’s new found ally and also by the fact that Nahas Pasha elated by success now considered himself as “the chief Arab leader.” His Majesty’s Government did not, however, find it possible to utilise his services in this respect. 83. An awkward situation arose in August over the departure for Palestine of Egyptian camp followers to take up employment with the British reinforcements recently arrived from England. A press campaign was speedily worked up by interested parties and cries were raised that Moslems were being sent to fight against Moslems and memories of the war-time labour corps were recalled. The Egyptian authorities, whilst themselves taking quite a reasonable view of the matter, did not feel able to withstand this outcry and all further parties were stopped from proceeding. 84. Notes were exchanged with the Egyptian Government in August pro viding inter alia for periodic meetings between representatives of the Palestinian and Egyptian Governments for the discussion of trade matters, railway rates and the adjustment of customs tariffs imposed by each country on the produce and manufacture of the other. The text of the commercial agreement was published in the Journal officiel of the 5th October. Roumania. 85. A provisional commercial agreement between Egypt and Roumania, replacing that of 1930, was signed on the 16th January. Saudi Arabia. 86 . There seems every reason to expect that relations between Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have at last been placed on a satisfactory footing. 87. Saudi Arabia had been represented in Egypt since 1924 by an agent to whom the Egyptian Government had for various reasons refused official recognition. t *i, 88 ' ! hu treat ' V w , hiel1 was ratified on the 8 th May did not cover the whole o he matters outstanding between the two countries, but made provision for the Oovernmentkf’rtJ 01 ^ 110 a “ d , c0 “™lar officers and the upkeep by the Egyptian As a re«d?if f ‘n e Haramein building (pious foundations for the use of pilgrims.) ireemen w. e T e a 1 b e ? otlatloI1 s on the main points in dispute the following 18th November, imt- ^ confirmed b y an exchange of notes dated thf ^ Th foSK C hm e A, W i U be t Sent fr ° m E ^ y P t with the same ceremony it will be reuWeP h yP I' T° rt wlU not P^ceed beyond Jedda wb -d 11 b re Pl a ced by a Saudi escort y and en charft d able P fu r nd t s 0 pr ° C6eds of the Hararaein the distribution of X f 6 t®'P tlan brovernment to be resumed, committee ° t0 be su P ervised b y an Egyptian (C) N “n Ito^thsXTh in , the territory of the ot her to opt (d) The Saudi Government to infom th^ECTnUan r 8 ™' t r or dues it is proposed to levy on pflgrims Government °f ^7 taxes League of Nations. representation on U the Co e ordinatin 1 ^ 1 Sam 3 tik ter r raiSed the loe 841011 of Egyptian °l at 6 ^ was proposed to send in fh ^ mmi ttee at Geneva.

In January the Foreign Office defined the nature and limits of the assistance they were prepared to afford the Egyptian Government in the event ot aggressive reprisals by the Italian Government for their adherence to the sanctions policy as relating only to military protection against military aggres sion and not to making good financial or commercial losses or pecuniary liabilities which might be incurred under Mixed Court judgments. On the 27th January the Italian Legation addressed a note to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs pro testing against the Egyptian decision to apply sanctions as a violation of her international engagements and reserving the right to claim compensation for any prejudice to Italian interests in Egypt. Egypt, in addition to the enforcement of sanctions, enforced all the ordinary rules of neutrality, especially in the Canal Zone, even when these rules proceeded from Hague Conventions to which Egypt was not a party. 93. Economic sanctions against Italy were discontinued by Egypt as from the 15th July and in August the application of the rules of neutrality against Italian warships passing through the Canal were relaxed at the suggestion of His Majesty’s Government. International Conventions. 94. By a decree-law of the 28th April, Egypt acceded to the International Load Line Convention and the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, her accession to take effect on the 24th October. 95. By a decree-law of the 4th May, Egypt acceded to the convention of the 11th October, 1933, to facilitate the international circulation of educational films. Chapter III.— Relations between Egypt and the Sudan. General. 96. Relations between Egypt and the Sudan continued to be satisfactory. During the early part of the year Egyptian interest was mainly centred on the role which the Sudan question was likely to play in the treaty negotiations. During the conversations on the military clauses the Prime Minister, Ah Maher Pasha and his successor, Nahas Pasha, on several occasions expressed optimistic s to the High Commissioner that the Sudan question would be found to be The reaction to the Sudan clauses in Egypt was. ^ the whole one ofbelieved that there would be a wholesale return Government service with the consequent openings “ black-coated ” class in Egypt. of Egyptian officials to Sudan to members of the overcrowded 98 In the Sudan no real enthusiasm was displayed, even by the young intelligentsia, for the treaty itself. The wording of the clauses which dealt wit^ the welfare of the Sudanese and the priority of their claim to Government appoim ments were welcomed, provided it was adhered to. The immediate fears which arose of an invasion of Egyptian officials and officers were soon dissipated, but the possibility of ultimate Egyptian penetration prejudicing the hopes of young Sudanese to eventual political independence created a certain uneasiness. _ In consequence, the reception by the Sudanese intelligentsia was characterised primarily by :•— (a) A marked intensification of national feeling, and (&amp;) A growing demand for a voice in the settlement of their own affairs and future. Among the great mass of the population the treaty excited little or no interest, any initial apprehensions which it may have caused disappearing when it became evident that there was to be no large-scale return of Egyptian officials. The Sudan Debt to Egypt. 99. The question of the payment of the Sudan debt to Egypt and the closely connected question of the payment by Egypt of an annual subvention of £E. 750,000 gave rise to considerable difficulties both during the treaty negotia tions and afterwards. The note annexed to the 1930 draft treaty had proposed that the matter of the debt should be left for subsequent discussion between repre sentatives of His Majesty’s Treasury and the Egyptian Ministry of Finance. It was now generally felt, however, that, if possible, an attempt should be made to secure a definite settlement of the question during the current treaty negotiations, linking it up with the continued payment of the sub vention. The Sudan Government’s suggestion that debt cancellation should take place pari passu with a reduction of the subvention was accepted by His Majesty’s Treasury. In the event, it proved to be impossible to induce the Egyptian delegation, either during the course of the conversations in Egypt or at the time of the signature of the treaty in London, to accept any such proposal. The matter was accordingly not specifically dealt with in the treaty, except for a paragraph of the agreed minutes which stated that discussions on the subject had already begun between the Egyptian Ministry of Finance and His Majesty’s Ireasury, and that no reference to it in the treaty was therefore necessary. The most that could be extracted from Nahas Pasha was a confidential letter to the principles - te m whlcil 116 confirmed that agreement had been reached on the ' ' 4 . 1 Government should not demand repayment of the debt a any time when it was impossible for the Sudan to pay without pieju icing t e maintenance of existing standards of administration ana public security.

Nile Waters Agreement. 101 . The question of the continued operation of the Nile Waters Agreement alter the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, was not raised during the course of the negotiations. Trade between Egypt and the Sudan. 102 . Egyptian imports from the Sudan in 1936 were valued at £E. 661,576, as compared with £E. 595,192 in 1935, an increase of £E. 66,384. The principal items of produce which increased included : melted butter, chickpeas, sesame, oleaginous seeds and grains, cinematograph films, hides and skins; whilst the main decreases were pepper and millet. 103. Egyptian exports to the Sudan amounted to £E. 893,171 in 1936 in comparison with £E. 968,161 in the previous year, representing a decrease of £E. 74,990. Main declines included : refined sugar, cement, &amp;c., cotton piece- goods, cotton-mixed-with-rayon fabrics, postal parcels; whilst increases were registered in the undermentioned goods; confectionery, cinematograph films, sil, rayon, &amp;c. 104. The total trade (imports plus exports) in 1935 amounted to £E. 1,563,353, with a trade balance of £E. 372,969 in favour of Egypt, but whereas, in 1936, the total trade was approximately the same, viz., £E. 1,554,747, Egypt’s favourable trade balance had shrunk to £E. 231,595, as shown in the subjoined table :— 1935. £E.

King Farouk. 105. Prince Farouk was proclaimed King on the day of his father s death, the 28th April, 1936. 106. A few days later a decree-law was issued fixing the civil majoiity of the King at 15 years. This measure, which was rushed through by Ali Maher, was designed to prevent the Kegents, and especially Prince Mohamed Ah from interfering with the private properties of His Majesty, and to keep the control of the Eoyal Wakfs in the hands of the Daira Khassa. 107. The decree was accompanied by an explanatory note of the I rime Minister in which reference was made also to the fact that the King s political majority, which was fixed at 18 years, could not be altered without a modification of the Constitution. After King Fuad’s death there had been much talk among politicians of all parties of the desirability of raising the age of Farouk s majority to 21 in order to enable him to return to England for some years to mrrmlete his education. It was argued that his education was veiy defective, and P that he should return to England for some years and be educated properly before assuming the responsibilities of kingship. At the same time, however, [15794 Dthere was the danger that during the years before Farouk attained the age of 21 the Wafd might get all the power into their hands and be tempted to give an anti-dynastic turn to Egyptian nationalism. The purpose of the explanatory note issued by Ali Maher was therefore doubtless to forestall any attempt which might be made to raise the political majority of His Majesty. 108. On his arrival in Egypt from England early in May, King Farouk was given an enthusiastic reception everywhere, the youth of the nation being particularly prominent in manifesting their enthusiasm. In political circles the air was thick with intrigue. Nahas and Prince Mohamed Ali seemed anxious to get His Majesty back to England as soon as possible. Each in his own way was no doubt jealous of the King’s popularity. On the other hand, Ali Maher, Sherif Sabry and Queen Nazli and the Court entourage wished to keep His Majesty in Egypt for a time to enable him to establish his own and his dynasty’s position. It was suggested that His Majesty should remain in Egypt for a few months with an English governor and then go to England. 109. This proposal met with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, and steps were accordingly taken to find a suitable tutor. aiu. wn tne om iv±ciy iviug rarouK issued a rescript in wmcn ms Majesty announced his decision to reduce his privy purse from £E. 150,000 a year to £E. 100 , 000 . This step was taken on the advice of Ali Maher, who wished His Majesty to anticipate a demand by Parliament for a reduction. 111 . By a decree dated the 30th June Ahmed Hassanein Bey (now Pasha) was appointed governor of the Royal Household with the duty of supervising the education of the King under the authority of the Regency Council. ^ 112 - Jhe High Commissioner, during his visit to England in June, took up the search for a suitable tutor for King Farouk, and as a result of his enquiries Mr. Edward Ford was chosen for the post. Mr. Ford arrived in Egypt and assumed his duties early m August. iv 1 ’ 13; n Towards the end of the year some concern was caused by reports of the mg s ill-health. Enquiries from the palace elicited the information that His Majesty had caught a severe cold and had trouble with his ears, one of which had projected tour to Upper Egypt popularity a'mong 3 his’peopT Unite HiS M T eSty aC&lt; l Ulred mUch to be seen at pubfic fu 2 ns and bk vontb v'’ y ° Ung Kmg was frequently interest in everything appealed to thetubliCmattnatten 6 ”' 111 ' 6 ^ ^ eVldent mentioned.

Eventually, this project was shelved, and, as a compromise, the Government appointed a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Palace Affairs. J 12E Another source of considerable friction between the Prince Regent and the Prime Minister was the former’s decision to bestow certain honours on the occasion of the signature of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty; Nahas Pasha, who was then still m Europe, vigorously disputed the Regent’s right to do this without prior consultation with the Government. Here, again, a compromise was ultimately reached after a good deal of wrangling, and relations between the Regents and the Prime Minister showed marked improvement towards the end of the year. 122 . Aziz Izzet Pasha, the second senior member of the Regency Council, is handicapped by a frail constitution, but has nevertheless shown unexpected stamina in resisting the Wafd’s designs on the prerogatives of the Crown. 123. The third member, Sherif Sabry Pasha, a brother of Queen Nazli, was Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs up to the time of his appointment as Regent. Although not a strong personality, he has proved to be a very useful and active liaison with the Wafd. 124. It is satisfactory to record that the Regency Council has consistently maintained close and friendly contact with the High Commissioner, and has frequently sought the advice of His Majesty’s Government on matters of policy. Ex-Khedive. 125. The ex-Khedive Abbas Hilmi visited Palestine during January and February 1936, and returned to Europe on the 28th February. 126. During the first half of the year there were rumours that the ex- Khedive, who was believed to be still aspiring to the Syrian throne, was in contact with Shakib Arslan and other Syrian nationalist agitators in Switzerland. 127. In June reports appeared in some of the local newspapers that the ex-Khedive might possibly visit Egypt and that Prince Mohamed Ali was believed to be in favour of allowing the visit. Shortly after these reports appeared, however, the Prince informed a member of the Residency staff that he had advised his brother to drop any idea of coming to Egypt for the moment In July the Prince informed the High Commissioner that he suspected that Sidky, [15794] E *whn was in Switzerland might be working on the ex-Khedive to interest himself more directly in the affairs of Egypt and that he had again warned his brother against any such idea. ]28 In view of these reports, His Majesty’s Government authorised the High Commissioner to take a strong line with Prince Mohamed Ah, or m any other quarter, if the issue became a live one. The High Commissioner spoke to Nahas on the subject and received an assurance from him that neither he nor his Government would have anything to do with the intrigues of the ex- edive. 129, Abbas Hilmi again applied for permission to visit Palestine in October 1936, but was refused by His Majesty’s Government on the grounds that the disturbed situation in that country at that time made his visit inadvisable. 130 In November it appeared again that the ex-Khedive, who had met Nahas and Makram at Karlsbad during the summer, might be trying to return to Egypt possibly to intrigue with the Wafd against His Majesty’s Government, Prince Mohamed Ali and perhaps King Farouk. On instructions from His Majesty’s Government, therefore, the High Commissioner spoke to Nahas, who replied that he had advised Abbas Hilmi to wait until Farouk reached his majority and then to approach His Majesty direct regarding his desire to visit Egypt. 131. In December the ex-Khedive visited Rome for a week. His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome reported, however, that it wa$ unlikely that His Highness’s visit had any political object. 132. Two local papers, the weekly Kashkul and the daily Misri have consistently sung the ex-Khedive’s praises and advocated (a) that he should be free to return to Egypt, and (b) that he should be accorded the full rights of an Egyptian to administer his estates in Egypt himself, and (c) that abroad he should be treated by Egyptian Legations with the deference due to his rank. 133. These papers, according to a frank admission made to a member of the Embassy staff by one Hamed Bey Alalaily, a local notable and a leading member of the Liberal Constitutional party who acts as His Highness’s publicity agent in Egypt, are subsidised. Hamed Bey volunteered the information that in London last summer he handed Maitre Abbu Fath, co-proprietor of the Misri the sum of £500. 134. This same Egyptian also stated that if Abbas Hilmy were allowed to return to Egypt, His Highness would make a declaration, in the form of a letter ot King larouk that he renounced all his aspirations to the Egyptian throne. Hamed Bey and his associates lose no opportunity of asserting the claims of the ex-Khedive m the course of conversation. i . 135 ' re y nt times the weekly Mussawar has stated that the ex-Khedive his d iUnesf ed Th1 eSlre t0 hls , brother Prince Mohamed!

The final results of the elections were as follows : — Chamber of Deputies— Wafd ... Liberals Shaabists Ittehadists Watanists Saadists Independents ... Non-official Wafd or a total of 179 Wafdist seats against 53 others. Senate— Wafd (elected) Opposition (elected) ... Nominated 65 14 53 139. INahas Pasha, who practically selected the 53 nominated candidates to the Senate, displayed considerable broad-mindedness in giving very fair representation to the rival parties. No religious heads were included; other notable omissions were all members of the Nessim Cabinet. 140. Voting in the cities was reported to have been unenthusiastic. There were a few minor incidents in the provinces, the most serious being a fight between the supporters of Tewfik Diab, editor of the Wafdist Jehad, and those of his opponent in the Sanhowa constituency of Sharkia Province. This affray resulted in the death of nine persons and injuries to thirteen others. On the whole, however, the elections were conducted with order and fairness and were probably the freest ever held in Egypt. The number of seats obtained by non-Wafdists was unexpectedly large. Of the non-Wafdist candidates elected, twelve seceded to the Wafd almost immediately after election. Approximately 1,200,000 votes were cast, roughly 75 per cent, for Wafdist candidates and 25 per cent, for non- Wafdists. Parliament. 141. The first important task of the newly elected Parliament, which assembled in Congress on the 8 th May, was to give formal approval to the composition of the Regency Council. The envelopes containing the names of the late King Fuad’s nominees were opened in the presence of both Houses, and it was found that the Regents selected were Adly Pasha, Tewfik Nessim Pasha and Mahmoud Fakhry Pasha. The two Houses then adjourned to deliberate, and subsequently unanimously approved the appointment of the Regents chosen by the party leaders, namely Prince Mohamed Ali, Aziz Izzet Pasha and Sherif Sabry Pasha. The Regents then took the constitutional oath before Congress. 142. Tewfik Nessim Pasha was elected President of the Senate, but resigned the appointment immediately owing presumably to his not unjustifiable annoyance at his exclusion from the Regency Council to which he had been nominated by the late King. Maitre Mahmoud Basyouni was appointed in his stead. 143. Parliament was opened with the customary ceremony by the Regents on the 23rd May, and friendly references were made in the Speech from the Throne to the treaty conversations. In its first session the Chamber of Deputies elected Dr. Ahmed Maher as its president by 212 votes. 144. An innovation in Egyptian parliamentary practice was the appoint ment of Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State to the Ministries of Public Plealth, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs. In addition, a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Palace Affairs was appointed. 145 One of the early acts of the new Parliament was to examine the constitutional validity of the decree-laws enacted since Parliament last met m 1 QQd Pnmrnittee for Constitutional Questions, after investigation, came to theNo 67 of 1934 and so render such measures permanently valid, the texts of such decree-laws should have been laid before Parliament at its first session on the 8 th May Actually, only a list of these enactments had been deposited. Eventually the Government deposited in due form the texts of most of the decree-laws promulgated in the three years during which Parliament had not met but purposely omitted to deposit a few controversial measures which it was considered iwnorliATit tr&gt; flllnw to laDSG. 146 The decree-laws abrogated by this means were Nessim Pasha s Press Law No 136 of the 14th November, 1935, empowering the Ministry of Interior under certain conditions to suppress offending newspapers administratively, and a few very useful measures of social, judicial and administrative reform introduced by Aly Maher Pasha on the eve of handing over the reins of government to the Wafd. 147. After an unusually brief summer recess, Parliament was convened in extraordinary session on the 2nd November to examine the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, which was in due course ratified. 148. The next session began on the 21st November with the ceremonial opening by the Regents. The Speech from the Throne contained hopeful references to the new era inaugurated by the treaty and envisaged far more projects of reform and development than are likely to materialise within the life of any one Government. Administration of Justice. 149. There was no change during the year in the personnel of the Judicial Adviser’s Office. The serious illness of Mr. Besly, however, during the period from April to October, necessitated the appointment of Mr. Payne as Acting Judicial Adviser during the absence of Sir Arthur Booth on leave. 150. Mr. Besly returned to work on the 21st October and is completely restored to health again. 151. There have been three Ministers of Justice during the year. Amin Anis Pasha, who held the post in the Nessim Pasha Cabinet, resigned with his colleagues on the 25th January and was succeeded by Ahmed Ali Pasha who had formerly been Minister of Justice in the Cabinet of Abdel Fattah Yehia Easha m 1933-34. The transition Cabinet of Ali Pasha Maher of which Ahmed r iV a wM W ? a me ™ be , 1 ' resi gp ed on the 11 th May, 1936, after the return oi the Wafdist party m the parliamentary elections. held the nn!ki'm 0 U ! l i, p sha G u aleb th ? n became Minist er of Justice and has absence o P f Makrfl m p a wa T s al f ac ting Minister of Finance during the sence of Makram Pasha Ebeid in London for the signature of the treaty . 8 inclined to^bosiTv^wP WaS a *?: pable and consci entious Minister though vexed questiim of' sktn/r.ei- SeCUr ^&gt; .

Mr. Payne’s influence in the parquet remained strong until the signature of the treaty since when it has naturally suffered a decline through the anticipated handing over to the Egyptian Government of His Maiesty’s Government’s responsibility for the protection of foreigners in Egypt. During the summer, when Mr. Payne was deputising for the Judicial Adviser, his post in the parquet was capably and conscientiously filled by his assistant, Mr. Grattan-Bellew. 160. The personnel of the State Legal Department remains unchanged except for the appointment of an additional Assistant Royal Counsellor, Abdel Malek Hamza Bey. 161. There have been three retirements of European judges from the Mixed Courts bench during the year. The first was that of Judge Crabites, the American judge in the Cairo Court of First Instance. On the question of the appointment of his successor, a controversy has arisen which is not yet resolved. The practice in appointing foreign pudges in the past has been that the Egyptian Government apply semi-officially to the Power concerned which then submits a list generally containing three names from which the Government’s selection is made. In the present case, however, it was desired to appoint a gentleman who was strongly recommended to the Egyptian Government as a first rate candidate, and the Egyptian Government wished to nominate him after obtaining the acquiescence of the United States Government, but without asking for a list. But an intimation was given to the Acting Judicial Adviser that the American Government would regard this course with disfavour and resist it. At present an endeavour is being made to hit upon a compromise which will satisfy both parties and allow the Egyptian Government’s candidate to be nominated to the post. 162. The other two resignations were from the Mixed Court of Appeal. Judge Messina, who has for some time been a titular member of the Court of Cassation in Rome, was invited by the Italian Government to take his seat in that court, and accepted their invitation. 163. The Swiss judge, Judge Houriet, also tendered his resignation in October for reasons of health. He reaches the age of retirement in April next and has been granted leave in order to extend his service until that date. 164. No appointments have yet been made to fill any of these three vacancies, but during the year a Dutch judge, Judge Struycken, was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Jonkheer van Ashe van Wyck. 165 An additional Belgian judge was appointed m the Court of First Instance to take the place of Judge de Wee, who was delegated for service on the Commission for the Revision of the Civil Procedure Code proposed by a u v/ToW PssW This commission, however, whose members were to receive [15794]date to permit the reinstatement of M. de Wee. M. de Wee having now been reinstated, M. Stenuit is supernumerary, being entitled to woik out the balance of two years certain for which he was appointed. 166 The work of the Mixed Courts has been carried out smoothly during the year, and there has been no recrudescence of popular feeling against them The question of modification of the “Reglement d Organisation as to presidency of Chambers and use of the Arabic language has been shelved, owing to the larger issues raised by the conclusion of the treaty and the proposed Capitulations Conference. 167. Judgment in the Public Debt case was delivered by the Court of Appeal on the 15th February. The court held itself incompetent on the ground that article 37 of the law of 1904 establishing the “ Caisse de la Bette,” whilst conferring jurisdiction on the court to decide matters arising out of the law, did not cover the decision of a dispute which, if decided in favour of the plaintiffs, would upset the stability of the whole structure erected by the law. An official announcement was later made by the ‘ ‘ Caisse de la Bette ’ at the suggestion of the Government that the practice of delivering certificates covering any difference between the tariff payment and a payment in gold which might eventually have been held to be due would be discontinued. On the 18th February the Court of Appeal held in the Private Debt cases that the law of the 2nd May, 1935, abrogating the gold clause in private contracts was valid and that payment of these obligations in gold could, therefore, not be claimed. 168. The crimes statistics for the year show an increase of 661 crimes and 975 misdemeanours. In both cases the increases are almost entirely in crimes of violence and reflect the increasing lawlessness of a large section of the population. The increase in these cases, however, may be partly attributable to the stimulus given to police activity by the particularly brutal murder of an Egyptian dancer during the year, which gave rise to wide publicity and much criticism of the alleged slackness of the police. The cases pending in the assize courts have decreased by nearly 200 since the end of 1935, but the number shown by the statistics at the end of 1936 (1,155) is still very large. Offences against Europeans increased during the year, the totals for murder and attempted murder being respectively 8 and 11 , as against 3 and 3 the preceding year. On the whole, however, satisfactory sentences have been imposed where it has been possible to apprehend the offender. 169. Statut personnel jurisdiction still continues to give rise to injustices. The law passed by Ali Maher Pasha’s Ministry, already referred to, piomised to mitigate these to some extent by providing that a change of religion during the course of proceedings should not entail any modification in the competence of the tribunal having jurisdiction at their commencement and by the institution of a Cour des Conflits ” for the resolution of disputes between two conflicting non-Mussulman jurisdictions or between the Mahkamah Sharia and ^ ! J '!' S f K:tlon , Unfortunately, however, opposition from the Sharia Courts and also from the Orthodox Copts as to certain provisions of the law caused it to be rejected by the Wafdist Government P tute he AA erK! 0 r No ''® mb ® r tbe Wafdist Government decided to reconsti- phced h ure G Ad suer Tf he ® evlslon of . the Codes of Civil and Criminal Aw to serve Whhnf “ obta f lmn S fpaMy equipped members who were “fiCr ”g,s“ 3 n e.tr.'/r3 ““ r ' d “n “ Figure Commission „d MoM, ‘of alTndi™ BSS Office, to the Criminal Procedure Commission. ouaiciai Advisers IjCCjlSlcitlOTl. fairlfholilAlAts eAlfefmomhfA “A A the ^ ar has been Maher embarked on an aAhio“™ m ^ wTslion^A^ 1 AH 01 the enactments nassed hv mio A- T e 01 le g lsl Mion by decree-laws.

The press law for the suppression of misleading news enacted by Tewfik Nessim Pasha at the commence ment of the Italo-Abyssinian war was also got rid of by this method. 172. Various measures of a constitutional character were necessitated by the death of King Fuad, and the accession of King Farouk on the 28th April. The preparations for the election of Parliament which were then in progress were considerably accelerated by a law of the 4th May, and Parliament met and approved the composition of the Regency Council on the 10 th of that month. One of the last acts of Ali Pasha Maher’s Government was to declare the new King’s majority for the exercise of all civil acts on the 4th May, 1936 (Decree- Law No. 41). Nahas Pasha’s Government, while leaving this law on the Statute Book, provided by a law of the 14th July that the King’s prerogatives in his capacity as chief of the Royal Family should be exercised on his behalf by the Regency Council. On the 20th July the Civil List of His Majesty was fixed at £E. 100,000 per annum, but subject to charges of £E. 7,000 for each of the Regents during their tenure of office. 173. Other measures of a semi-constitutional nature were a Law No. 51 fixing the salary of members of Parliament at £E. 480 per annum and decrees of the 18th June creating Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State in the Ministries of Public Health, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs and one for Palace Affairs. This last appointment was much criticised on the ground of its inconsistency with constitutional practice. The Under-Secretary is attached to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. 174. The only other law of a general political character was the Amnesty Law passed on the 10th August, which afforded full and entire amnesty for all crimes and delits, or attempts thereat, except murders, committed with a political motive or end during the period from the 19th June, 1930, to the 8 th May, 1936. The rest of the year’s legislation can be conveniently dealt with under the usual headings, viz., Economical and Financial, and Social and Administrative. [15794]178. Social and Administrative.—The Law of Workmen’s Compensation (law No. 64 passed on the 14th September) is probably the most important enact ment under this heading during the year. It is the result of much study and follows in a simplified form the principles of the English Workmen’s Compen sation Act. The main principle is that of insurance independent of the presence or absence of negligence on the part of the employee. The scale of compensation is naturally very much less than that provided in English law. 179. Two laws on the press were enacted by the Maher Ministry on the 27th February. The first replaces an unpopular decree-law of 1931. It renders less stringent the conditions on which a press can be opened, and does not reproduce the stipulation contained in the old law, that newspapers appearing more than three times a week must own their own presses. Administrative suppression of foreign newspapers is limited under article 22 of the law to cases where public order is concerned. 180. The second law establishes a special regime for editors and others sent to prison for offences against the provisions of the Penal Code relating to the press. They are given most of the rights accorded by the decree of the 9th February, 1901, to those sentenced to preventive detention. 181. A Press Association was formed on the 20 th April, 1936, to uphold the rights of the press, and its statutes were approved by decree of the same date. 182. The Azhar University was reorganised and its curriculum modernised in many respects by Decree-Law No. 26 of the 26th March. Ib3. Ihe position ot toreign officials m the Egyptian Government service was dealt with by Decree-Law No. 44 of the 4th May. The position of these officials had formerly been very anomalous, owing to the provisions of the Con stitution that no foreigner could be employed in Government service except in virtue of a law. Such a law had been in the project stage for many years, but now came into force in a form generally agreed to be satisfactory. Provision is made tor a committee of Under-Secretaries to control the admission of foreigners to posts for which there are no suitable Egyptian candidates. English teachers in the Ministry ot Education will in future have greater security of tenure owing to a provision enabling them to be treated “ a T instar des fonctionnaires egyptiens permanents after a satisfactory probationary period. 0t , her measures of a general nature were Law No. 68 , passed on the he r e eCtl0 j °f P rovlncla l councils, an amendment of the Ltabhssements Publics Law to deal with the nuisance of wireless sets in cafes and the law m preparation for the census of 1937. 1 ’ 185.

Of these ? latter able Vpe of crime &amp; 6 eState agent ’ a P art i c nlarly objection- a ^ tk 0 ' ^ lthou g h it; is gratifying to note that the courts have at last inflicted a death sentence m a case where a European in the provinces has been murdered b y Egyptians it is a great pity that those responsible for the murder of the Greek estate agent above referred to have again managed to escape punishment. 191. In two cases of the murder of Greek estate agents in the provinces, sentences had not been pronounced at the end of 1935 (see paragraph 268 of the report for that year). In the first case (that of Nicholas Seratis), one of the accused was sentenced to penal servitude for life, while another received a sentence of fifteen years’ penal servitude. In the second case—that of Jean Bassiliadis, who was murdered in July 1935—the committing magistrate considered that there were extenuating circumstances and changed the classification from pre meditated murder to murder without premeditation. As a result, notwithstanding the accused’s confession, he was sentenced only to fifteen years' penal servitude. 192. The evidence in the first of these two cases was such that death sentences should have been passed on the accused. When it became known to the European Department that this had not been done, and in view of the repeated failure of the courts to inflict capital punishment in such cases, the Director- General suggested that the time had come for the High Commissioner to approach the Egyptian Government and to point out the very bad effect on European public security of the repeated failure of the courts to pronounce death sentences in cases of premeditated murder when the guilt of the accused was proved beyond reason able doubt and in which little could be urged in extenuation. A note was, indeed, drawn up in collaboration with the office of the Judicial Adviser, together with suggestions as to the form which the communication might take, but in the event no action was taken. 193. The total number of crimes throughout the country has increased from 7,415 in 1935 to 7,848 in 1936. There is a rise in every category of crime with the exception of “theft with violence,” which registers a decrease from 408 in 1935 to 346 in 1936. 194. The increase in the number of serious crimes throughout the country during the 1936 judicial year over the same period in 1935 is particularly unsatis factory, as the 1935 figure was already considerably higher than the figure for 1934. 195. The increase in crime in Upper Egypt is much more accentuated than in Lower Egypt, the worst provinces being Assiout, Girga and Kena. The province with the most favourable record is JMenoufia, whose Governor is Ahmed Mohamed Azmi Bey, a very efficient mudir who spent the greater part of his career in the Cairo City Police. 196. Of the cities, the returns from Cairo are the most unfavourable. 197. This general increase in crime throughout the country is probably attributable to the following causes (a) The frequent changes amongst mudirs and other high administrative officials. . . (b) The fact that most of these officials have in recent times been more occupied in manoeuvring to improve their own position vis-a-vis tkeir political chiefs than with matters affecting the improvement of public security.(c) The return of some measure of prosperity in the provinces, a fact which is Generally followed by some deterioration m the state ot public security, probably because the fellaheen have more time to think or things other than the earning of their livelihood. (d) The fact that the omdas, who are the last but by no means the least important link in the administrative machine, now owe their nomina-g 5 tion to their political colour and to the number of votes they can secure for their party, rather than to their administrative ability or probity. (e) The fact that omdaships have been frequently changing hands and the rivalry of the various factions supporting dismissed omdas, who never abandon hope of return to power. 198. The importance of the omda in matters of public security in the provinces cannot be overestimated. When a crime occurs in his village, it is he who is in a position to know what has really happened. His powers to assist the case for the prosecution are particularly great during the time which elapses between the commission of the crime and the presentation of the case, as he is as a rule able to frustrate any attempts to spoil the evidence. This is particularly true in cases where Europeans are the victims and Egyptians the aggressors, when the efforts to influence the witnesses in favour of the accused are generally intensified. 199. At present the omda’s main efforts are directed to serving the political party in power and not to carrying out the instructions of his administrative superior, the mamour, whose power to inflict punishment on him, if he fails to perform his duties satisfactorily, are nil, as long as he (the omda) is on the right side politically. 200. Unless, therefore, there is some radical change in this state of affairs, it is unlikely that any great improvement from a public security point of view will take place. Students’ Political Activities and Strikes. 201. It was hardly to be expected that the strikes and disorders among students would automatically subside once the political fever which had occasioned the serious outbreaks in the autumn of 1935 had abated. There still remained the more deeply-rooted economic factor of ‘ ‘ black-coated unemploy ment as an incentive to further manifestations of discontent. Moreover, the strike mania had acquired such a hold that the students were no longer amenable w . km f. of . discipline either in or out of school; Government authorities, Waidist politicians and headmasters were all powerless to restore complete and lasting order. The students possessed and used a will of their own. t-u gl i nnmg 0± Januar y il was reported that Mohamed Mahmoud nf i 6 L f 1 1 berals were instigating students to cause further trouble in the ^ revoktion. Apparently, the Liberal leader’s aim with Great Britain 'ti''''™ U 1 A 1 cm stiliJtion was worthless without a treaty Obeid was aHe tn f info [ matl01 ? &gt;“d the Wafd, however, and Makram Ubeid was able to exert a calming influence over the students It was also toComote^eformair y° ha “ ed Mahmoud Pasha was endeavouring o promote the tormation of a body of students hostile to the Wafd and a minoritv Kmi S'” th2”Sig n ,S t ,''S‘ , £ ‘Sits 2 5 =sv,T.*s2 f Krsr i Sr “2 Ss ss ssrrs ‘l™ ;”sr«.,d a r““f f ssss Front, there '' d '' ' h ' » f “&gt;* students.

On the 10th December, however, the Bourse egyptienne published an account of an interview with the Prime Minister giving’the first indication mat the Oovernment were at last resolved not to tolerate further students’ strikes. IN anas Pasha was also reported by the Bourse to have declared that one of the mam tasks of the Government was to give careful attention to the future of the young generation. At the end of the year the prospects of any definite and lasting improvement in the black-coated unemployment problem were still remote, particularly in view of the economy campaign foreshadowed in all Government departments as one of the means of counterbalancing the extra expenditure which will be imposed by the execution of the treaty. The Blueshirt Organisation. 206. A resolution to form an organisation of young men on Fascist lines was adopted at a congress of Wafdist Youth on the 6 th January. In fostering this movement, the Wafd were no doubt actuated by their alarm at the progress which the minority parties had made in enlisting the support of the student element, and even in organising them on semi-Fascist lines, and by their desire to have at their disposal a force to oppose any anti-Wafd move on the part of the palace. One of the more immediate objects envisaged by the Wafd was apparently to engineer the co-operation of this organisation with Wafdist committees in support of Wafdist candidates in the parliamentary elections which were expected to take place within a short time. It was decided that the distinguishing mark of the members should be a blueshirt uniform. 207. Parades for military drill were organised in imitation of the Fascist system. Nessim, indeed, said that the Government were considering legislation for controlling these organisations and actually prohibited parades in public, but the Aly Maher Government did nothing to counter these activities. It was inevitable that the rivalry between this Wafdist group and the Young Egypt Society’s greenshirts should sooner or later grow acute, and in June there occurred a serious clash between them in the streets of Cairo, sticks, stones and daggers being used. Shortly after this episode Nahas Pasha issued an order forbidding these youth organisations to parade the streets armed with truncheons, knives or any other kind of weapon. 208. Meanwhile, a committee had been formed by the Wafd to organise and discipline the blueshirts, whose numbers were reported in July to have increased to a total of about 10 , 000 , of which, however, only a small proportion were really active. The committee was composed of three ex-army officers, whose duty was to supervise the militarv training, and of a few AYafdists and students. Nahas Pasha was made president of the movement. 209. In July the High Commissioner warned Makram Obeid of the danger of allowing this movement to grow unchecked, and the latter stated that the leaders of the blueshirts had been instructed to direct their activities into legitimate channels, such as sport and athletics. The Minister of I mance adde that the Wafd has been particularly careful that no political leader of mark, such as himself, should be at the head of, or openly associated with, the blueshirtorganisation. These assurances did not, however, remove or even diminish t e concern felt by the responsible administrative authorities m the Egyptian Govern ment at the continued growth of the movement and the overbearing conduct of its members. 210. Further representations were made by the High Commissioner in November, this time to the Prime Minister, and Nahas Pasha replied with the statement that he was taking steps to keep the movement clear of politics and to develop ‘ £ Wafd athleticism/’ On the instructions of the Secretary of State, the High Commissioner again emphasised to the Prime Minister on the 2/th November the view of His Majesty’s Government that early and effective measures should be taken to deal with a state of affairs which had begun to excite the liveliest apprehensions on the part of foreigners. Nahas Pasha took these representations on good part, and repeated his earlier assurance that “ Waft athleticism ” would henceforth be the aim and object of the movement. Disreputable elements, he said, would be eliminated, and the carrying of weapons of any kind would be absolutely forbidden. 211. Towards the end of the year reports were received of schism within the movement. A clash had occurred in October between the student faction, a minority led by Zoheir Sabry, and the larger working-class faction under Mohammed Belal. As a result of this incident, Nahas intimated to Zoheir Sabry that the working-class section was not to be molested. This admonition had the effect of inclining the student group towards the Nokrashi-Ahmed Maher section of the Wafd, while the workers’ section remained loyal to the influence of Nahas and Makram Obeid. A further clash between the rival groups occurred on the 1 st December in Cairo, and a few cases of injuries resulted from the use of truncheons, despite the Prime Minister’s order forbidding the carrying of any weapons. 212. Eventually, on the 6 th December, the Waft Secretariat issued a state ment, according to which the blueshirts were henceforth to be controlled by internal regulations and to be under the president of the Wafd. The statement emphasised the athletic and sporting aspects of the organisation and forbade the carrying of arms. It established an executive council to act on behalf of the president of the Wafd. The council was headed by a retired army officer, Hafez Sidky Bey, and included the leaders of the rival students’ and workers’ groups. The wearing of blue shirts in public places was forbidden, and was only to be permitted on occasions to be defined by the executive council. These regulations if applied, would have the effect of introducing a larger measure of discipline into the organisation, without, however, divesting it of its political character Young Egypt Society. 213.

The hostility to the Wafd also made it impossible for the Young Egyptians to show any enthusiasm for the Anglo-Rgyptian Treaty, despite their fervid propaganda in favour of Egyptian independence m the early part of the year. Their attitude was publicly defined in a declaration published in the Ahram of the 6 th September, which described the treaty as imposing real occupation on the country for a period of twenty years subject to renewal, and as diminishing Egypt’s' rights in the Sudan. The declaration urged a militant struggle against imperialism until Egypt secured her full independence and took her rightful place in the comity of nations as the leader of all the Islamic countries. This extremist agitation was conducted in collaboration with the Watanist party. Chapter V.—General. Egyptian Army. General. 218. The beginning of the year found Egypt still overshadowed with the threat of an Italian attack on the western frontier. The Officers Commanding Egyptian Army and Air Force units stationed in the Western Desert continued to co-operate closely with the British commanders in those areas. By the spring the tension had slackened and units were gradually withdrawn, the Egyptian battalion at Mersa Matruh being the last to go in September 1936. Modernisation Proposals. 219. The Egyptian Government put forward towards the end of January counter-proposals to the proposals of His Majesty’s Government (see paragraphs 300-303, 1935 annual report) welcoming the supply of modern weapons, but only agreeing to a very limited, and temporary, increase in the number of British personnel. At the same time they asked for a large increase in various branches of the army itself. No further action was taken in this matter in view of the initiation of the treaty negotiations, with the prospect of the complete emancipa tion of Egypt from any restrictions in military matters and the establishment of a military mission. Military Mission. 220. During the rest of the year expiring contracts of British personnel serving with the Egyptian forces were either renewed for a few months only or not at all In December, the Prime Minister informed the High Commissioner that it was his intention to get rid of all the British personnel on the ratification of the treaty and replace them with the Military Mission provided for m his letter to Mr. Eden of the 26th August, which formed part of the treaty settlement. The Egyptian Government were informed that Major-General J. H Marshali- Cornwall C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C., had been selected to head the Mission and it was arranged that he should come out with a skeleton staff and make whateveradditions were necessary after he had studied conditions on the spot. Negotia tions regarding the conditions of service of the mission delayed his departure until after the end of the year, and it was arranged with the Egyptian Govern ment that notice of the termination of contracts of the Inspector-General, Egyptian Army, General Sir C. W. Spinks, and his British staff should not be given until the mission arrived, so as to avoid a breach of continuity. Return of Egyptian Forces to the Sudan. 221. In November Brigadier Franklyn, the Officer Commanding Sudan Defence Force, visited Cairo with a view to making preliminary arrangements for the return of certain Egyptian units to the Sudan as provided for in the Treaty, and for the despatch of an Egyptian staff officer to Khartoum to discuss details. The Egyptian Government were informed of the general ideas of the Governor-General on the subject, but little progress was made. Air Force. 222. The aircraft strength of the Egyptian Army Air Force was increased by two transport aeroplanes and approval was given by the Residency for the formation of a flight of three Avro training machines. The six Audax general purpose aeroplanes ordered the previous year (see paragraph 304 of 1935 annual report) had not arrived by the end of the year. 223. About 4,000 hours’ flying was again carried out during the year without involving any serious injury to personnel, and a further general improvement took place in the flying ability of the more senior Egyptian Army Air Force pilots. 224. During the course of the treaty negotiations it was suggested to Nahas Pasha by Sir R. Brooke-Popham that whatever might be decided in regard to the future of the British personnel serving with the Egyptian army, it would be in Egypt’s own interest to retain the Royal Air Force officers and non commissioned officers in the Egyptian Army Air Force, since their continued presence was essential to the safety of Egyptian lives and aeroplanes. When, at the end of the year, the Egyptian Government decided to get rid of all the British military personnel, it was understood that the Royal Air Force personnel would be retained for the time being in executive command. Frontiers A dministration. T } e a ^ norma ^ situation in the Western Desert continued until about the middle of the summer, when various precautionary measures for the control of Italian activities in that area (see paragraph 310 of 1935 annual report) were finally withdrawn. r ' a a 22Q \ ^ urm g year relations between the new Director-General, Frontiers dministration, and Miralai Wallace Bey, legal secretary at the Administration fff S f C /w 0 d eCa r very , s ‘ rained - This appears to have been mainly to deal with ir ° f Wallace Be y. and Green Bey, Governor of the Western Desert, to deal with serious irregularities on the part of an Egyptian inspector in the enfoved' the^mnfMen 'G a*? br o ther ’ the Director of Personnel at Headquarters, FnXnd on ?° nfidence y® Director-General.

British personnel either in the civil or military branches o± the I rentiers Administration. General. Civil Aviation. 232, In February, Group Captain R. J. Bone, C.B., C.B.E., succeeded Group Captain Sir Q. Brand, K.B.E., as Director-General of Ci.vil Aviation. 233. During the course of the summer the various restrictions imposed on civil flying during the previous year in connexion with the Anglo-Italian crisis, e.g., prohibited zone in the Western Desert, ban on photography from the air, &amp;c., were relaxed and finally abolished. Mersa Matruh airport was evacuated by the military authorities and handed back to the Department of Civil Aviation. 234. The macadam runways at Dekheila aerodrome were completed. Work proceeded on the installation of direction-finding stations, and was completed at Dekheila and Mersa Matruh. 235. A proposal was put to the Prime Minister by the Residency in May for the transfer of the operation of the air meteorological services in Egypt from the Royal Air Force to the Egyptian Government. This would involve the operation of the services conjointly during the training of Egyptian personnel. No decision had been taken by the end of the year. Misr Airwork. 236. The number of passengers carried in 1936 was 15,710 as compared with 6,990 in 1935. 237. Considerable difficulty was experienced by the company in obtaining payment of the subsidy from the Egyptian Government, partly owing to slackness in pressing their claims on the Ministry, partly owing to a disagreement as to certain items of the “ standard case ” on which the payment of the subsidy was based. In March 1936 the subsidy for seventeen months, part of 1934 and the whole of 1935, was paid, but at the end of the year the company was still owed about £72,000, representing the amount of the annual subsidy due for 1936 and a sum of £E. 6,400 odd due in respect of overhead charges. 238. A proposal was put forward by Mr. Muntz and subsequently supported by the Minister of Communications for a weekly service on the existing subsidy to Cyprus-Bagdad-Damascus, with an intermediate shuttle service Bagdad- Damascus-Haifa. The approval of His Majesty’s Government was given to this proposal as far as Cyprus and Palestine were concerned, but, m view ol the refusal of the French authorities to grant permission to operate m byria, Damascus was excluded from the service. 239 In September the Governor of Cyprus notified the Residency of his desire to discuss with a representative of Misr Airwork the possibihty of an all-year-round air mail service to and from Cyprus, which he had been author s d by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to explore. It was accordinglyarranged that the managing director of Misr Airwork, Kemal Eloui Bey, and the Director-General of Civil Aviation should visit Cyprus, when discussions took place as to the terms of an air mail contract. It was subsequently proposed by the Minister of Communications that the Cyprus and Egyptian Governments should each pay half the cost of the additional subsidy required for the extension. 240. No accidents took place in the operation of the line, but one of the four-engined aircraft operated on the Bagdad service encountering a squall was blown out of its course and forced to land in Sinai. This arose from flying above the clouds without adequate direction-finding facilities between Haifa and Egypt. Imperial Airways. 241. Imperial Airways continued to operate regular though by no means always punctual air services through Egyptian territory. In the latter respect Imperial Airways compared most unfavourably with K.L.M., being frequently a day or even two days late in arriving. No definite decision was taken by the Egyptian Government in regard to the participation of Egypt in the Empire Air Mail Scheme, but some progress was registered. The original delay in dealing with this matter was due to departmental discussions in regard to a number of extraneous questions, such as the proposed construction of a Marine Airport at Dekheila and the Egyptianisation of the air meteorological services, which had been included in the proposals put to the Government by the former Director-General of Civil Aviation. In April Messrs. Bertram and Banks of the Air Ministry arrived in Egypt and spent some weeks in Egypt and the Sudan discussing details of the ground organisation, passenger arrangements, &amp;e. Further delays took place on the accession to power of the Wafdist Government and it subsequently emerged that the new Minister of Communications, Nokrashy Pasha, was not satisfied that the benefits which Egypt would enjoy under the scheme justified her in tying herself up for so long a period as fifteen years. In August it was ascertained that the Ministry of Finance had accepted the scheme, but Nokrashy Pasha still remained doubtful. Towards the end of the year, howeyei, he informed the oriental secretary that he had accepted the scheme in principle, and that it only remained to settle technical details of application, e.q., alighting arrangements at Alexandria and Cairo. 242.

A further request was received for the alternative use of Gallabat landing ground, and in addition for the treatment of Khartum as a customs air terminus for the purpose of this service Con sultation of the Sudan Government and of the War Office and the Air Ministry showed that both on military grounds and on grounds of expense there were strong objections to the proposals for the improvement of either of the two aero dromes up to the standards required by modern aircraft. The Governor-General also objected for reasons of expense and sanitary control to the establishment of a customs air terminus at Khartum. Luft Hansa. 250. For some time the German aircraft industry has been attempting to get a footing in aviation in Egypt, chiefly through the instrumentality of Taher Pasha, who is vice-president of the Misr Airwork. Various projects for direct lines between Germany and Egypt were mooted and suggestions were made for equipping Misr Airwork with German machines. Early in the year His Majesty’s Government received a request from the Greek Government to implement their undertaking to use their influence with the Egyptian Government with a view to facilitating negotiations between the Greek and Egyptian Governments for the establishment of air communications between the two countries. As the Greek Government were at the time considering proposals from Luft Hansa for the virtual control of Greek civil aviation, it was decided to take no action in this request pending the outcome of the German company’s proposals. Subsequently the Greek Government agreed to delay their approval of the German proposals pending the submission of alternative proposals on behalf of Imperial Airways with a view to the establishing of Anglo-Greek services ( 1 ) between Athens and38 “ E Tl « £T c,»,» »v54rsri.'r ’e^S G^ra »”«f 'wiVtaTheTS,^'? C.Tf, oV^hS »”“»«« SSfe'-iftSsts ^rt^asirafS making good any deficit, it was suggested to the Director-General of Civil Aviation that before granting permission for the formation of the company he should insist on the close examination of its financial arrangements in view of e unlikelihood of its being able to pay and the possibility of its asking for a subsidy later on. In the meantime Mr. Muntz, of Misr Airwork, suggested to the Residency the possibility of applying to the Egyptian Cxovernment for the reserva- tion of the Cairo-Athens service for the Misr Company. He took no concrete action in the matter, however, owing to the financial difficulties of the. company and the impossibility of increasing their capital without running the risk of the intprpsts in the eomnanv beine bought out, possibly by German interests. 252. By insisting on having full technical details of the equipment and maintenance organisation of ‘ £ Homs ’ ’ before requesting the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to approach the Greek Government in the matter, the Director- General of Civil Aviation, in spite of considerable pressure, was able to postpone a decision in regard to the application. In the meantime, on instructions from the Foreign Office, the matter was raised with the new Prime Minister, Nahas Pasha, and also with Makram Pasha, the Minister of Finance. The latter fully agreed with the view that the establishment of such a service,. if really necessary, should be a matter for Anglo-Egyptian co-operation, and said that he would carefully scrutinise the “ Horns ” proposal when it eventually came before him. 253. On the 8 th June the “Homs” Company informed the Director- General of Civil Aviation that details of its agreement with Luft Hansa, which showed that the latter was to be responsible for the entire organisation and financing of the company, which was, in fact, Egyptian only in name. The Director-General of Civil Aviation then informed the Ministry of Communica tions that, in his opinion, this introduced elements of a political nature which would require reference to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and Nokrashy Pasha agreed to take no further action unless approached by the company again. Subsequently, as the result of further representations by the Residency, it was decided definitely by Nahas and Makram to turn the scheme down, and nothing more was heard of the matter. 254. Towards the end of July it was learned that the plans for the co-opera tion of Imperial Airways in the Greek air services had broken down and that His Majesty’s Government were unable to offer the Greek Government any proposals involving financial assistance to Greek civil aviation. The German negotiations with the Greek Government were, however, at the same time held up by a German request that they should be given permission to operate a wholly German service through Athens to Egypt and Palestine. His Majesty’s Minister at Athens suggested m this connexion that the Egyptian Government might refuse per mission for Luft Hansa to operate to Egypt. The Director-General of Civil Aviation thought it might be possible to do this by insisting on preserving the Athens-Cairo service for the Misr Company. In the meantime, however the Gieek Government gave in and the convention between Greece and Germany was signed. J 255. On the 9th December the German Legation applied to the Ministry of Communications for provisional permission to operate a service to Egypt before the end of the year. The Director-General of Civil Aviation was asked by the Residency to delay a decision on this application pending proposals from His i ajesty s Government m regard to the possibility of operating Anglo-Greek and Anglo-Egyptian services between Greece and Egypt. P b sTelecommunications and the Treaty. the Britis^coXoT e? n t°l f the desirabilit y or otherwise of raising the question of tne -oriusii contiol of telecommunications to, from and through Envot in mn the maXlnXiTeX ne f?f was carefully considered in consultation with me managing director of the Marconi Company of Egypt It was at first fnlt P n a E W ? Uld ^ P referabl e not to raise the matter, bSt to rely on the Marconi nosidonwUrh X “ ono P ol y- w h lc h still had seven years to run, and the assured position which the company had built up for itself. It was however derirWI in dX^mmitteetw 1 mX Ce ’ nX “notation with the Imperial Communica- ons Committee, that ( 1 ) it would be dangerous not to obtain some recognition in the treaty of the existing ^ facto position; ( 2 ) that His Majesty’s Government’s demands should not include a request for a de jure monopoly in favour of Marconi; (d) that these demands should be restricted to some form of reaffirmation of the exchange of letters m regard to wireless communications between Sir P. Loraine and Ismail Sidky Pasha in 1932. The draft of the treaty submitted to the Egyptian delegation accordingly contained an agreed minute specifying that the means of communications to be placed at the disposal of Great Britain by Egypt m the event of war, imminent menace of war or apprehended international emergency included telecommunications and that, in view of the possibility of the necessity arising out of the use of Egyptian telecommunications for the purposes of the alliance, there would be consultations between the Egyptian and United Kingdom Governments with regard to any proposed important measures affecting such communications. 257. This proposal was strongly opposed by the Egyptian delegation, and particularly Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha, on the grounds that it constituted a virtual return to the old wireless caveat. Eventually it was found that the most the Egyptian delegation could be induced to accept was that the matter should form the subject of an exchange of notes, not to form part of the treaty or to be made public immediately, whereby the Egyptian Government proposed that, in view of the importance of telecommunications to and from or in Egypt in con nexion with their alliance with the United Kingdom and the extent to which unforeseen changes with regard to those matters made in time of peace might affect plans made in war, both Governments should follow the principle that such communications should be in the hands of exclusively Egyptian, British or Anglo- Egyptian concerns. An exchange of notes in the above sense took place between Sir Miles Lampson and Nahas Pasha on the 12th August. Wireless News Messages. 258. At the end of 1935 the position was that the Government had obtained an undertaking from the majority of the leading newspapers not to intercept illicitly, or cause to be so intercepted, news telegrams transmitted by radio from abroad in return for (1) the free supply of a copy of the British official wireless; and (2) a reduction of the royalty payable on multiple news telegrams. Only the Mokhattam, Al Gehad and Rose-el-Youssef stood out, but continued close police observation, with a view to the suppression of unauthorised radio interception, resulted in their not practising any fresh illegal interception. Meanwhile amend ments to the Radio Law were submitted which would deal explicitly with me publication of illicitly intercepted messages. As regards the Biitish official wire less, no complaints were received regarding discrimination in favour of the Biitish service, though one Egyptian journalist complained of the form m which the British official wireless news was received. 259. The situation was rudely disturbed by the announcement m the press of the 21st February o c a decision of a Portuguese judge of the Mixed Correctional Court of Appeal in Alexandria, which was at first interpreted by the press as meaning that the newspapers were entirely free to use wll eless instruments for the reception of news. The matter was at tabe “ Marconi Reuter’s and Havas, who took a serious view of the situation resulting from 5 the decision. Subsequently examination of the mdgment showed^ IW thp decision had been entirely misrepresented, and that, m tact no question of orinciple had been involved, the accused, who should have been charged with megaUy pubUshing news, was, in fact, charged with having installed a wirelessapparatus for reception of telegraphic news without a permit. As t e apparatus actually seized was an ordinary wireless set for which he had a permit, he was acquitted. 260. Though the correct facts were given to the press, their previous interpretation of the judgment naturally gave a set-back to the Government campaign, and several newspapers, basing themselves on the judgment, resumed the publication of illegally intercepted news. The chief offender was the Phare egyytien, which openly announced its intention of taking news from the accused in the above case. A case was brought against the newspaper for pirating news, and judgment was delivered against it and a small fine inflicted. Fresh instances of pirating by the paper took place however, and another suit was brought against it before the'Mixed Courts, judgment in which had not been pronounced at the end of the year. The Societe Radio-Orient. 261. In April representations were made to the Marconi Company by an authorised representative of Radio-Orient to settle £ £ the dispute between the two companies ” on the basis that the Marconi Company should urge the reinstate ment of Radio-Orient in return for an undertaking not to take more than 10 per cent, of the traffic and to give guarantees against future malpractices. Apart from the fact that Marconi did not admit that they were concerned directly in the dispute, which was a matter for the Egyptian Government, they were not satisfied that any such guarantees would have any value in view of their knowledge of the continuance of a system of bribes and rebate in other countries. 262. After the failure of various approaches, the French Minister informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Posts and Telegraphs Administration of the Fevant found itself compelled to resort to arbitration against the Egyptian Government under article 15 of the Madrid International Telecommunications Conference of 1932. Apart from the fact that such arbitration would have to take place between Governments, it was conceded by everyone, including the Marconi Company and the British General Post Office, that arbitration under this article could not be refused, though it was felt that, in view of the shady dealings of Radio-Orient, the demand for arbitration was very probably a bluff, bhould, however, the French Government, in spite of this, finally resort to arbitration, and in the most unlikely event of such arbitration resulting in a decision that the Egyptian Government were not justified in suspending the Radio-Orient service under article 33 of the Madrid Convention, it was considered that m any event Egypt, as a sovereign State, was under no obligation to grant permission to Radio-Orient to open agencies in Fgvpt. On the other hand — W p d . lv ! d f d , as t .° whether, except by suspension under the convention, the Egyptian Postal Administration could refuse telegrams routed by Radio-Orient TT^ Mo‘- J h &gt; e I ^ anaging director of Marconi was assured of the full support of Nokrashy had previously been inclined to be susniemn* nf C AltJl0U gh Marconi Company, he eventually came round tn ilL , • US ^- e motlves the advantage of the Egyptian Government that PnrT n 1 ™ was n °t to the At the same time however he feared fhil bn 0nent should be ^stated.

The proprietors of the leadine papers conf^ctsh t helr fl ,PP recla t 10n of the efforts which were made to strenfthen 1 the contacts between the press and the Embassy. 268. Early in the year arrangements were made for representatives of the vernacular press to see British and Egyptian troops co-operating in the Western esert. They were entertained by the General Officer Commanding and the local Egyptian Governor Judging from the articles which subsequently appeared, e object for which the tour was organised, namely, to educate public opinion towards the advantages of an Anglo-Egyptian alliance, was successfully achieved. 269. As it was so clearly established that the press responded so effectivelv to a show of goodwill on our part, and also with a view to inspiring their leading representatives with respect and admiration for British institutions and the stability, prosperity and strength of the British Empire, it was decided to studv the possibilities of a conducted tour of Great Britain. It was hoped that this prospect might materialise in the summer of 1937, and that it might produce substantial results. 270. The extent to which Italian (and other foreign) subsidies operated in influencing the press was naturally the subject of the closest study. Whilst there could be little doubt that in 1935 the Italians assumed for a short time effective control of the Ahram at the price, it is said, of £15,000, there were indications in 1936 that they found this method too expensive, and contented themselves with financing smaller and less influential papers, such as the Chabab, Re forme, the Patrie, Partout, The Times of Egypt, and bribing minor members of the staffs of the Arabic papers to reproduce appropriate selections from these sources, and also from the “ Agence d’Egypte et TOrient ” telegrams. The propaganda office of Signor Dadone had supreme control over the distribution of Italian trade and tourist publicity, an observation which might apply equally to the German Legation, and to a lesser extent the French. There were reports from time to time that the Italians had struck a financial bargain with Tewfik Diab of the Jehad, and it appeared more than probable that this paper’s uncompromising attitude towards British policy in Palestine might be traced to this occult influence. There were strong indications, early in the year, that M. de Laumois, of the Bourse egyptienne, was not quite immune from Italian generosity. The campaign in certain sections of the press for a non-aggression pact with Italy, that Egypt had nothing to fear from Italy’s occupation of Lake Tsana, and that the mere presence of British troops in Egypt constituted a danger of her being involved in a war in which she had no concern, might be attributed to the activities of Signor Dadone. 271. Whilst the blatant effusions of the Bari Radio (in Arabic) could not be regarded as coming within the domain of the press, except in so far as they affected the receptivity of the newspaper reader to hostile propaganda and were reproduced in unimportant rags (like the Phare of Alexandria), which continued to indulge in piracy of news from the air, it might perhaps be convenient to mention here that on many occasions semi-official representations were made to the Italian Legation with a view to curbing its activities. In every case the reply was returned that the “ Ente Italiano di Audizione Radiofonica ” was not under Government control, but that an endeavour would be made to urge this organisa tion to exercise caution. But as the messages frequently contained recent anti- British extracts from the Egyptian press it must be concluded that the Bari Radio was in the closest contact with Italian propaganda activities in Egypt. Particularly as regards British policy in Palestine, the tone of this station wasextremely offensive and deliberately calculated to discredit British prestige in the Near East. 272. Towards the end of the year the Press Bureau assumed the resounding title of Department of Press, Publications, and Culture. Dr. Farid Eifai ( an ardent henchman of Nahas Pasha) was promoted to the ran , General with a largely increased staff, including an ex-journalist and hanger-on of Nessim Pasha, Achille Bey Sekaly as head of the ^ ur opean section Ihe methods of Dr. Rifai, reminiscent of those employed m the days of the Ottoman Turks, were to suborn wuth small bribes the minor members of newspaper sta s, with a view to the insertion of articles favourable to the ‘ regime, but often totally devoid of truth. It was a system which naturally did not commend itself to the proprietors and editors-in-chief, who at no profit to themselves were m constant fear of having their columns used for purposes in flagrant contradiction to their policies. It was not, therefore, surprising that Dr. Rifai continued to be heartily disliked by the leading members of the journalistic profession. On the other hand, on more than one occasion, the Residency was able to utilise the services of Dr. Rifai—notably in regard to news from Palestine—in his capacity of controller of Government advertisements. 273. At the end of November 1935 the Arabic papers had declared a one day “ strike ” as a sign of protest against British policy in Egypt and the Cabinet’s pro-British attitude, and the year under review opened in a thoroughly hostile atmosphere. Throughout the press there was a doubt as to Great Britain’s sincerity of purpose in wanting to negotiate a treaty at this juncture; and when the Nessim Cabinet resigned, the Wafdist press maintained that it had gone too far in yielding to British pressure. 274. It was not until the treaty delegation was finally appointed that this cloud of hostility and doubt showed any signs of clearing. So sensitive, however, was public opinion to the slightest hint that our willingness to negotiate a settle ment was actuated by “ imperialistic ” motives that, with a view to reducing this element of controversy to a minimum, it was decided to enjoin upon the press of both sides the desirability of maintaining the discreetest possible silence in the course of the treaty ‘ ‘ conversations ’ ’ which would be conducted in camera. A few words in this sense addressed by the High Commissioner to the English and by the Prime Minister to the Egyptian press had the most gratifying response. The limes, whose foreign editor, Mr. Philip Graves, was in Cairo in the early stages published a remarkable leader on the 10th June, at a moment when doubt as to the sincerity of our intentions and apprehension for the future had again become a most disquieting feature. Extensive reproduction in the Arabic press of this article which advocated respect for Egyptian national feeling and moderation in military requirements, had an almost magical effect on public opinion. 275 ' Fr °j m th l S on yards, as the conversations progressed, the tone of i *? reS A PffTfmularly the Wafdist section—became increasingly friendly and by the time the de lations left for London, even the Balaqh which by its distorted “ revelations ” of British “claims” had done its utmost to create spirit of antagonism and distrust, expressed the hope that the “ successful co elusion of the present negotiations would open a new era of prosperity ” occupied considerable space from the end of August til? tKte of 'the'1^ siderations has always affOTdedinilTsupport to th^f 10 ' ^ financial con ' dropped its pro-Italian and anti-Brit,'KfL Vt Goveram ent, completely feature of its policy in 1935 The social contapt’ hV * 31 W; , lS suc ^ a conspicuous Gabriel Takla^asL, and L ResSy“ Proprietor, many occasions it was found possible to exert ™ tefl ' A stre ngthened, and on of this personal factor. THs papereLentis K “ ° U ^ h the eXpl ° itation With an increasing circulation withm and ™t ofe t ]0Urnal ^information,” which could not lightly be ignored d ou t of Egypt, continued to be a force 278. The Mokhattam which had wUU ^ -tv Nessim Government in 1935, transferred its mild IZTioi toCh fflyMate a con- inand Nahas Administrations. As regards the treaty its general tone of approval was tempered by the hope that the military commitments would not entail excessive taxation. 279. The Jehad continued to be regarded as the main Wafdist organ, and, in expressing its delight with the terms of the treaty, attributed the lion’s share of credit to Nahas Pasha and his Wafdist colleagues. Its proprietor, Tewfik Diab (who. spent some years of his education in a Hampstead boarding-house), was genuinely pleased at being able to express his approval of Anglo-Egyptian friend ship—a new departure in Wafdist journalism. Towards the blueshirts this paper showed considerable affection. 280. Early in the year the daily Rose-el-Youssef came under the editorship of Abdel Rahman Fahmy, an uncle of Dr. Ahmed and Aly Pasha Maher. The activities of this paper became so intolerable that Nahas Pasha was finally compelled to pay the proprietor to dismiss Mahmoud Azmy, with the result that in July it ceased publication. 281. The Kaivkab-esh-Sharq lost a great deal of prestige when Dr. Ahmed Maher left the staff on his appointment as President of the Chamber. Its circulation dwindled to a few hundred copies. It continued, however, unstintingly to support the Wafd and the treaty. This paper was the real champion of the blueshirts, and hotly controverted any suggestion that this move ment was formed for purposes other than purely athletic. 282. The Balagh was the “ nigger in the woodpile.” Its criticism of alleged British aims to hoodwink the Egyptians into a one-sided agreement became so unequivocal that towards the beginning of August it was thought advisable to come to an understanding with its proprietor, Abdelkader Hamza. Its circula tion was increasing by leaps and bounds, and there was a danger that the extreme susceptibility of certain members of the delegation—and public opinion generally ■—might be adversely affected by these pin-pricks and hammer-blows which were not devoid of a basis of logic. Desisting henceforward from attacks on the treaty, the Balagh concentrated on the most violent and frequently scurrilous criticism of the Government, selecting as its principal topics the blueshirts, nepotism and internal administration. Nahas Pasha retaliated by the usual method of depriving this paper of Government advertisements—a source of revenue to which Egyptian papers of necessity attach tremendous importance. 283. The month of September saw an important addition to the daily press in the appearance of Al Misri {The Egyptian)—under the proprietorship of Mahmoud Abbou Fath (lately senior member of the Ahram), Karim Tabet (lately of the Mokhattam), and Mohamed Tabei (proprietor of the Akr Sa’a). The politics of the paper were declared to be “ Wafdist ” and its methods “ modern.” The Misri would appear to be coquetting for the support of the younger genera tion of army officers and also aiming to cater for the requirements of university students. Its agitation against British personnel in the Frontiers Districts Administration and Christian missionaries in the Sudan was a source of consider able annoyance. There were many indications that Karim Tabet maintained his long-standing relationship with the Italian Legation. 284. Towards the end of the year the organs of the minority parties, the Shaab Ittihad and Syassa, ceased publication. The latter continued under a different proprietorship as a weekly paper, but no longer as the official mouth piece of the Liberal Constitutionals. 285. Whilst the daily Arabic press became uniformly friendly towards Great Britain, the same could not be said of the weekly papers. Eikri Abaza, m the Mussawar, continued to ply the United Kingdom Government with editorial pin-pricks on their imperialistic tendencies and made repeated references to the conspicuous presence of the British troops in the streets of Cairo. Nevertheless, the proprietor of this paper was prevailed upon to consider it expedient to keep his criticism within reasonable bounds. Thanks to the prestige and very ab e pen of the Watanist editor, the Mussawar continued to attract a large number of readers from the student and “ effendi ” classes. 286 The Wafdist satirical magazine Akr Sa’a, relinquishing John Bull or the High Commissioner as the principal butt of its humorous witticisms, divertedits gibes towards Mohamed Mahmoud, and, to a lesser extent, Abdel Eattah \ ehia and Ismail Sidky. The Rose-el-Youssef (weekly) was, throughout the period under review, distinctly anti-British, but it was not thought necessary to take special steps to curb its activities. The Lataif-al-Musawara, a poor imitation of the Mussawar, broke out from time to time with lurid stories about British atrocities in Palestine. In this case, means were found, by the manipulation of advertisements, to put a stop to a form of propaganda which, it was strongly suspected, was due to Italian influences. The Kashkul, whilst being violently anti-Government, made a feature of airing the grievances and singing the praises of the ex-Khedive. 287. Amongst the weeklies which appeared for a short time and then ceased to exist might be mentioned the Chabaab under the editorship of Mahmoud Azmy. This publication became the principal mouthpiece of Mohamed Ali Taher, the notorious Palestinian agitator, whose articles on the nefarious activities of British policy in the Arab world might have had an unfavourable repercussion if this paper had had more than a few hundred readers. There is little doubt that the Chabaab was for a time subsidised by the Italians. After a few months of active but unprofitable existence it ceased publication. Similarly, the Sarkha, the organ of the Young Egypt Society, which made sporadic appearances, only to be suppressed by an order of the court, failed to become the “nuisance value” it might have been under more responsible editorship. 289. The Bourse egyptienne, which had professed dictatorial, pro-Italian and anti-Waidist sympathies under the aegis of Mr. de Laumois, completely changed its tune under the acting editorship of M. Jean Lugol during the former’s absence on leave. The Wafdist Reforme was palpably under Italian influence, and its proprietor, Comte Aziz de Saab, secured an interview with the Duce at Rome th ?.

But their activities were on a niuch smaller scale than those of the Italians. mn l n Marcl i’ tlle Min istry of Aly Maher, a new Decree-Law (No. 20) was promulgated to replace Press Law No. 98 of 1931. It contained certain modifications as regards press offences, and permission to publish a iournal irTeaTh ^ 6 con( ^ ltlona ^ u P on t ^ le ability to furnish a guarantee instead of a deposit 297. At the same time Decree-Law No. 21 was issued providing for the institution of a special prison regime for persons condemned for press offences. Ihe provisions of Decree-Law No. 136 of 1935 empowering the Ministry of the Interior to impose sanctions for the publication of news which might endanger security or public order were maintained. They continued to prove salutary. 298. In April a decree was published to approve the statutes of a Press Association, which was being formed on the initiative of Aly Maher himself. No progress, however, was made in its actual formation and’the association itself was until the end of the year still non-existent. 299. The following figures relating to the circulation of the principal papers were furnished by the Press Bureau. They can only be taken as an approximate indication :— Al Masri (daily) 20,000 Al Abram (daily) 45,000-50,000 Al Mokattam (daily) ... 8 , 000 - 10,000 Kawkab-el-Sharq (daily) 2,000 Al Siassa (daily) 200 Allttahad (daily) 500 Rose-el-Youssef (weekly) 3,000 Al Gihad (daily) 4,000-5,000 Al Balaqh (daily) 4,000-5,850 Al Wady (daily) 300-500 Akher Saa (weekly) 11,000 Al Sabah (weekly) 14,000-16,000 Al Mosawar (weekly) ... 22,000 Al Lataef (weekly) 11 , 000 - 12,000 Al Magalla-al-Gedida (weekly) 2,500 Al Magalla-al-Gedida (monthly) 2,000 Al Moktataf (monthly) 2,000 Al Hilal (monthly) 5,000-6,000 Al Itnein (weekly) 8 , 000 - 10,000 Al Donia (weekly) 16,000-18,000 Al Kateb (weekly) 6,000 The Egyptian Mail (daily) 4,000 The Egyptian Gazette (daily) 6,000 Le Journal d’Egypte (daily) 5,500-6,000 La Bourse egyptienne (daily) 12,000 La Patrie (daily) 2,000 Les Images 7,000 Dimanche et Partout (daily) 5,000British Education and Culture. 300. The High Commissioner’s Advisory Committee on Education continued its work in 1936 in a mood of some disappointment at the inability of the n is Council to find the funds with which to meet many of its recommendations put forward in April 1935. These feelings were communicated to Lord Lloyd Chairman of J Near East Committee of the Council during his exploratory visit to Egypt in January. The arguments in favour of the establishment of a British Institute or similar' body were fully explained to him and also the difficulty of finding financial support in Egypt from an already overburdened British community for the education of Maltese and Cypriots^ Lord Lloyd pointed out that the establishment and support of the British Council by His Majesty s Government was a fundamental departure m policy, and he was hopeful that sufficient funds would eventually be forthcoming. 301. After Lord Lloyd’s departure the committee prepared schemes for a British institute and, in close consultation with the Port Said community, for an English school at Port Said, mainly for Anglo-Saxon and Maltese children. These were forwarded to London with a recommendation for official financial assistance to enable them to be started. 302. In April information was received that out of a total sum of £6,000 devoted to the Near East by the British Council the following grants had been made to Egypt:— ^ (a) For the establishment of a British institute in Cairo- Capital grant ... ... ... ... ... 1,250 Annual grant ... ... ... ... ... 1,500 (b) To the Maltese school in Suez— Capital grant ... ... ... ... ... 750 Annual grant ... ... ... ... ... 1,000 (c) To the English school in Cairo— Annual grant 400 (d) To the Scottish school in Alexandria 50 303. The annual grants were restricted to a period of two years in view of the uncertain financial position of the Council. 304. The High Commissioner had under consideration the best method of launching the new institute when he was called to London in connexion with the treaty negotiations. On his return the summer season had set in, and in the absence of leading Egyptians and members of the British community, further progress was necessarily held up until the autumn. This proved a fortunate c ance, as during the summer, the British Council found themselves compelled to le fZd n^ofTlbt Tlf t0tal ^, m ° f P' 000 ' whlch was ^adequate ^ was midt fonlffipr^Hn^ n Possibility of starting a less ambitious scheme was under consideration when the committee were informed of an Eowntinn initiative m the improved post-treaty atmosphere for an Anglo-Egyptian^Union “het^TulfirrulTtb 7 S h Cia l f S ^ucat.onal fn chSer w3d! mixed English and Egyptian commlttpe° t ''pi'eposcdinstitiile.

Sir Robert Gres the new chairman of the counci is mnlHno- , h L ljre ? Roman Catholic schools have been started in Cairo by &amp; fathers of the African mission and are able to take some Maltese pupils. 308. The English Girls’ College in Alexandria opened in temporary premises with Miss Milvain, M.A., &amp;c., as headmistress, and had a most successful first year, with as many pupils as the school could deal with in its first year in temporary premises. As the estimated expenditure of £E. 75,000 exceeds the total subscriptions of £E. 64,000, the Acting High Commissioner urged His Majesty’s Government in September to consider making a further grant of £ 10 , 000 , which would be especially appreciated after the signature of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. This recommendation was still under consideration at the end of the year. The new buildings were commenced in the summer, and are expected to be ready before the next school year begins in October 1937. British Educational Establishments. 309. The year 1936 was in general a satisfactory year for British schools in Egypt. One or two new schools were established, the number of pupils everywhere increased and the financial situation improved. Victoria College. 310. This school continued to hold a unique position in Egypt, and its value to Anglo-Egyptian relations was outstandingly illustrated by the important role played by a former headboy, Amin Osman, who, as secretary-general to the Egyptian treaty delegation, played an invaluable part in the negotiations, explaining the British point of view most patiently and successfully to the Egyptian delegates without at any time forgetting his position as an Egyptian official. English Girls' College. 311. As stated above, this school had a most successful year, and the number of pupils overtaxed the resources of the temporary building. The school appears to be most fortunate in its first headmistress, Miss Milvain. British Boys' School. 312. The number of pupils was kept up, and this school had a successful year. Scottish School for Boys. 313. This school received a small grant from the British Council as some slight encouragement for the excellent work it had been doing. Enalish School, Cairo. carried on as acting neaamasun in — to Mr. Grose had been made at the end ol the year.English Mw&gt; m 0ve d into new buildings at Koubbeh in October and had a d rf w«fc to b, Mr. Mrtm .»d h,. staff during the last twelve years. British Roman Catholic Schools. _ . 316 The fathers of the African mission informed the Residency of their intention of enlarging the scope and imparting a more definitely British character to Roman Catholic schools at Shubra and Heliopolis^ These schoo s cater for several hundred pupils and are an important part of British cultural equipment in Esvpt. British School, Suez. 317. Owing to the British Council’s capital grant of £750 and an annual grant of £l, 000 °this school was enabled to reorganise itself, engage a competent headmaster and staff, and so opened the new school year in the autumn of 1936 with much brighter prospects than at any previous stage in its history. Farouk College. 318. During his premiership, Aly Maher Pasha put forward a scheme for what he termed an Egyptian Eton. It was to be staffed by English masters and run on English public^ school lines with the best class of Egyptian pupil. This scheme was approved by the Council of Ministers but was shelved when the Wafd Government succeeded Aly Maher's Government in April. British Examinations in Egypt. 319. The extension of these examinations to Egyptian as well as foreign pupils resulted in a considerable increase in the number of pupils taking the London University examinations at Victoria College, Alexandria, and the English school, Cairo. Unfortunately, the preparation of the majority of candidates for these examinations is inadequate and there is at present a very large percentage of failures among the Egyptian candidates. Egyptian University. 320. The Egyptian Government decided to revive the chair of classics with the indention of appointing an English professor to it. The general position at the Egyptian University was considerably eased during the course of the year by the replacement as professor of English of Professor Sencourt by Mr Furness formerly oriental secretary at the Residency. The latter appears to be on excellent terms with his Egyptian colleagues and the University authorities, and the English Department appears to have run more smoothly since his arrival. he discipline of the students has, however, suffered very much from the Dolitical deni.QSti'aCions ot th. ]„, a „d ,h. „ u |„ ot lh , L„ in 7 t i™ amendments, at the close of the year 7 ap P roved ’ Wlt}l cer tam mine English plays in Maroh'vrhiVwafa^t^U n sea j°“ classical and mode Egyptian Government invited^his Ainanvf 7 ^ fina ' clall y successful.

Lacau was succeeded on the 8 th June as Director-General of the Antiquities Department by the Abbe Drioton, formerly Curator at the Louvre. This appointment coincided with the appointment of Selim Bey Hassan as sub- Director-General. The latter at once made every attempt to push himself forward at the expense of his foreign superior and colleagues. In general, however, the French have held their own in the higher cultural departments! M. Remond has made a success of the Beaux-Arts and M. de Wiet has been successful in his organisation of the Arab Museum. Efforts have been made to secure more adequate British representation by the ex officio appointment on the Arab Museum Committee of Captain Creswell, professor of Islamic art at the Egyptian University. The general position is, however, somewhat unsatisfactory and the only non-official British subject who takes a keen interest in these matters is Sir Robert Greg, who is almost the only British representative on the various cultural committees, on which the French are well represented. The Alexandria Municipality. 324. Mr. Davies, the sub-Director-General of the Municipality, in April drew attention to the steady fall in the municipality revenue from £E. 1,000,000 in 1927-28 to about £E. 825,000 in 1935-36, which has resulted in deficits every year, although the standard of municipal services left much to be desired. He suggested a transport concession as an immediate remedy and advocated increased control of the municipality by the Ministry of the Interior and not the trans ference of the municipality to the Ministry of Public Health as proposed by Aly Maher Pasha. Mr. Davies’s main contention was that much could be achieved through close official contact between himself and the Director-General, European Department. In response to representations from the High Commissioner the Prime Minister agreed to retain the municipality under the Interior. 325. Shortly after the entry into office of the Wafd, the Prime Minister in June informed the Acting High Commissioner of his intention to apply the decree of the 1st January, 1935, and institute elections to the Municipal Com mission. He was unmoved by all Mr. Kelly’s arguments, and refused all compromise suggestions, e.g., nomination of foreigners from consular lists or election by foreign communities from lists prepared by foreign, authorities, or postponement of the whole question until reform of the municipality had been completed. The Prime Minister agreed, however, not to hold elections until November or December. Eventually they were postponed until after the ratifica tion of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and until the Capitulations issue had been settled. This was largely due to Badawi Pasha’s belated discovery that the law of 1935 was not valid until it had been ratified by Parliament. His Majesty’s consul-general, the president of the British Community Council and Mr. Davies were all strongly opposed to the introduction of the new law. 326. Discussions proceeded during the year with reference to the reform of the municipality, and Mr. Davies, with the valuable support of Colone Thornton chief inspector, accomplished many practical improvements, badek Younnes Pasha retired on the 24th May from the post of Director-General and was succeeded on the 2nd July by Hamed-el-Chawarbi Pasha, a rich Wafdist with no particular qualifications for the post. He showed himself helpful m inducing the Prime Minister to postpone the application of the law of 1935, and he suggested certain modifications in the law itself which might be made after the elections to meet the views of the foreign communities. The Prime Minister agreed to this. 327. In August the Foreign Office requested the Residency’s views as to whether or not it was of importance that the international character of t munffiipaHty should be defended. The Foreign Office approved the view exoressed bv the Acting High Commissioner that, while we should m the interest of the local British community continue to work not only for foreign f firm tmt fnr thp best tvoe of foreign representation, we should frame ouUactics on the basis that in the last resort the prolongation of its Internationacharacter depended on Egyptian goodwill (particularly ' n ^ r ti P^fXTst'to°be ditions), and neither could nor should be regarded a « a ' fl e f“^ a ‘ pertinaciously defended with all our latent reserves of influence or menace. 328. In December a difficult situation arose owing to the nomination b y ^e Prime Minister without any prior notification of twu additional Dgyptia members of the provisional Administrative Commission, thus destroying the equal balance between Egyptian and foreign representation. The High Commissioner drew the Prime Minister’s attention in a letter dated the 8 th December to the unfortunate effect of this action upon foreign opinion m Alexandria, and invited his Excellency to restore the balance by the appointment of two additional foreigners. 329. On the 9th June judgment was entered in the Mixed Court in the Corniche Poad case. The court ordered the payment of £E. 372,000 to the tractors, as compared with their claim of £E. 436,000 and the municipality s estimate of £E. 260,000. The costs are to be borne as to one-third by the con tractors and two-thirds by the Government and municipality. The latter are also condemned to pay £E. 2,000 damages to the contractors. 330. On the 14th February the Association of Foreign Officials in the Alexandria Municipality drew the Residency’s attention to their unsatisfactory position, and urged that they should be assimilated to Egyptian Government officials in respect particularly of compensation on withdrawal from the service under Law 28 of 1923. This has, of course, never been done owing to the special international character of the municipality and the undesirability of encouraging the Egyptian Government to regard it as a purely Egyptian institution. 331. The Foreign Office felt that the Egyptianisation of the municipality would probably be hastened by the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, and that, without raising the matter with the Egyptians at present, some scheme should be devised to protect the interests of the foreign officials, particularly in view of the steps already taiken in the direction of Egyptianisation in recent years. 332. After consultation with the financial adviser, the Residency recom mended that, whilst it would be a mistake to take any initiative in demanding the application of Law 28 of 1923 to foreign officials in Alexandria Municipality as long as it was intended to maintain its international character, if and when the Egyptians, as seemed likely under post-treaty conditions, succeeded in changing the international character of the Administration, then the Embassy should ask the Egyptian Government to apply Law 28 and allow foreign officials m the municipality to retire on similar terms in regard to compensation as foreign irf i Q 99 an ^ ve £, nm ® nt w Jl 0 retired after the declaration of independence in 1922. The Foreign Office m December agreed that no representations should be made for the time being, but that the matter should be raised with the Egyptian Government the moment there was any indication they were likely to take ^teps to end the international character of the municipality. His Majesty’s Govern- S r th t°r d ^ - Hl r^ Commissioner to assure the Association ^of Foreign Officials of the municipality that His Majesty’s Government intended to do their best to secure compensation for them should necessity arise. ^ treatefcat^S^ lm P rove ‘ he Potion of badly- that the introduction of rfardanfh S t kw m tL t l aCher &gt;- the F ° T ^ n 0ffice f T appointments of British officials in snoh Vi P re J u ^ 10e necessary additional Districts Administration and the Survev Tt fi De P art “ a * the Frontiers advisers were, however, strongly of the omnion twTt ad Yi ser and the other to deprive 1,618 foreign officials includme- (inn JA 1 this consideration ought not th ® 'f w la Y&gt; , e -9-’ greater security of tenure &amp;c ’The S ’ benefits of withdrew their opposition, and after considemhie Th 1 ore ign Office, therefore, missioner and the financial adviser a decree-law w!f - m T fro , m the Hi g h Com - foreign officials a legal status securitv of t SI gned on the 4th May giving contracts adequate repatriation allowances tems of the *r •to tocto, be to . tog,, toto S ,°S£i 551 ofTontractsZder tbre^Z 1 n ° tified Z ee m0nths m adrallce in tha case over three vearsnf ’ an&lt; J.

The normal procedure under the law is for all appointments of foreign officials to be referred to a. Mimstcna 1 Committee of Under-Secretaries of State presided over by the Minister of Finance, but an article was inserted to enable the Council of Ministers to make special appointments in case of need without such reference to the committee, and so meet the difficulty originally raised in connexion with this law I he law was duly approved by Parliament and has worked smoothly. 334. As regards the foreign teachers, the largest category of foreign officials (numbering about 900 persons), article 15 of the law lays down that provided their services are found satisfactory during the first two years’ service, they will be maintained on a permanent basis until the age of 60 on the same terms as Egyptian civil servants in respect of discipline and security of tenure. 335. Although satisfactory in itself this article did not meet the legitimate grievances of the school teachers repeatedly placed before the Residency by their association regarding their poor prospects as regards increases of pay and promotion. A scheme was prepared by Mr. Simpson, the Comptroller of Physical Education and Chief Inspector of English, designed to secure increases in salary and better prospects of promotion after stated periods of service. It was repre sented forcibly and repeatedly to the Egyptian authorities, from the Prime Minister downwards, by the Residency and by the Financial Adviser, that it was in the Egyptian interest to bring such a scheme into operation, as the Egyptian Government could not otherwise expect to attract a good type of teacher to its service 336. As a result of very strong pressure from the High Commissioner, the Simpson Scheme was approved by the Council of Ministers on the 7th May, just before the resignation of Aly Maher’s Government. Owing to various administrative delays and the preoccupation of Ministers with the treaty negotia tions, the arrangements for transferring the existing staff to the new cadre were not completed until the end of the year. The Egyptian Government were naturally anxious that its benefits should not apply to inefficient teachers with whose services they proposed to dispense. 337. By the Council of Ministers’ decision of the 9th December, 75 per cent, of the English masters were placed on a scale of £E. 450-600, rising by biennial increments of £E. 30, and 25 per cent, on a scale £E. 600-780, rising by biennial increments of £E. 45. The French teachers, whose qualifications are less high, and the English mistresses are in similar but slightly lower categories. An additional cadre was approved for English and French Inspectors and for inspectresses at the following scales of pay respectively : £E. 780-900, £E. 720-900, and £E. 600-780, all with biennial rises of £E. 45. Quarantine Board. 338. The budget for the financial year ending the 30th April, 1936, balanced at £E. 102,000. 339 . The pilgrimage season was smaller than in 1935, only 10,500 as compared with 12,000 pilgrims for Egypt passing through the camp at Tor, where arrangements remained entirely satisfactory. 340 On the 1st May, in accordance with the International Sanitary Convention of 1926, the veterinary services of the Board were trans f er n red ^ the Ministrv of Agriculture, thus diminishing the revenues of the Board by about £E 8 000 a year. The Board, however, maintained that it should continue to supervise the export and import of animal products, e.g., skins boiies, &amp;c. The British representative on the Board was instructed to support the Board s vinw without however, provoking a direct conflict with the Egyptian Government.341. During the year several other sources of friction developed between the Board and the Egyptian Government: (1) The latter maintained that the Portuguese delegate on the Board must be of Portuguese nationality and refused to a '- P reauested of a French doctor. The Portuguese Charge d Affaires requested Residency intervention, but the matter was eventually settled by ms own nomination. . (2) The Egyptian Government in 1935 had suggested a compromise arrange ment for settling the long-standing dispute regarding a permanent cadre of the employees of the Board. In spite, however, of frequent requests f rom the Board, the new arrangement has not yet been brougiit into force and many employees of the Board can receive no increments of pay nor promotion from the Egyptian Government. Residency intervention was invoked, but it was considered dangerous to xaise this issue whilst the Egyptian Government had under consideration their future policy towards the Board under post-treaty conditions. (3) An unfortunate incident arose in July when a drunken British sailor broke through the skylight of a Quarantine Board laboratory in Alexandria and broke test tubes containing typhoid microbes. The Egyptian Government affected to consider this incident as proving ineffective control on the part of the Quarantine Board and in endangering the health of the population of Alexandria, but it turned out that there was little justification for this view. 342. A more serious incident arose in connexion with the renewal of the appointment of General Duguet, the French Inspector-General. This post must be filled by a European, but the Egyptian Government showed extreme reluctance to renew this appointment with the result that General Duguet requested the intervention of the Residency. Accordingly, just before his departure for London in August, the High Commissioner approached the Prime Minister, who replied that he was thinking of abolishing the Quarantine Board altogether in the near future. The High Commissioner urged that no hasty decision should be taken in view of the international character of the Quarantine Board, and of the fact that its activities were not only of interest to Egypt, but a matter of life and death to Europe. It proved impossible to discuss this question with hi anas Pasha during his stay in London, but representations were made through Amm Osman urging the prolongation of General Duguet’s appointment and the danger of acting hastily in the matter of the Quarantine Board at a time when the goodwill of foreign Powers would be needed by Egypt in connexion with the Capitulations Conference. The Egyptian Government finally agreed to renew Creneral Duguet s appointment for a period of six months. 343. In view of the Prime Minister’s threat regarding the future of the Quarantine Board its legal status and the policy of His Majesty’s Government J f f C i? nS M elei ? at departmental meetings in London between the Foreign Office present inOctobef The ’ at WhlCh P res 1 ! dent 1 of Quarantine Board was of the Board depended on theVnlhry :c ■ sKsasrrs: ■ saffitfejn* Board in itHresent fom re P re “ive took the view that the Services were retained.

Amin Osman suggested that if the Caisse de la Dette were abolished then it might be easier to postpone the demand for the abolition of the Quarantine Board. Irrigation. 345. Supplies were ample throughout the year—in the spring and summer they were about normal and the Greater Assouan Reservoir contributed an addition of nearly 5 milliard cubic metres of water. Permits were given for 400,000 feddans of rice cultivation. 346. The flood was rather higher than normal, but fell below normal in November and continued so until the end of the year. In spite of these low levels there was no difficulty in filling the Assouan Reservoir. 347. Progress continued satisfactorily on the remodelling of Assiout Barrage where Messrs. J. Cochrane and Sons (Limited) are contractors. The work should be completed in 1938. 348. In November 1936 some six months after the first submission of tenders, the construction of the new Mohamed Aly Barrages was allotted to Messrs. Macdonald, Gibbs and Co., at a cost of £E. 2,750,000, and work was begun immediately. 349. Reclamation of waste land and drainage works continued according to programme in the Northern Delta as also basin conversion work in Upper Egypt. 350. The strengthening of Nile banks proceeded according to the policy laid down, but will take several years to complete. 351. In the Sudan good progress was shown on the construction of Gebel Aulia Dam—the whole of the masonry dam was completed and the embankment dam is well in hand. The entire work will be finished in the spring of 1937. Drug Traffic. 352. While the position regarding the drug traffic in Egypt is incomparably better than that of a few years ago, it is only by unceasing vigilance that the smuggling of white drugs is kept down to its present modest dimensions. An increase in the smuggling of Chinese heroin has been observed during the year. The crews of French vessels are said to be the persons mainly concerned. In July, however, a British marine was found in possession of more than 6 kilo grammes 800 grammes of opium. He was tried by court-martial together with two other marines and all three were convicted of conspiracy to introduce drugs into the country. All were discharged with ignominy from His Majesty’s service and sentences of imprisonment were also imposed. Imperial War Graves Commission. 353. Brigadier-General Sir E. Hart, formerly Administrator of Samoa and a New Zealander, succeeded Col. Hughes as Chief Administrator in the Eastern District, and arrived to take up his post in July. 354. He raised the question of the status of the Imperial War Graves in Egypt in the event of a treaty settlement. It was suggested that the question should be handled by the Imperial War Graves Commission in London and the 17 ™™ nffino nnrl rGnision was finallv reached to negotiate a new conventioncommittee on which Egyptian officials would sit. The draft was still under consideration at the end of the year. 355. It has been decided that the headquarters of the Eastern District should be transferred to Jerusalem in 1937. Pilgrimage. 356. The number of Egyptian nationals who performed the pilgrimage in 1936 was 5,742, an increase of 363 on the total for the preceding year, hears engendered by the Italo-Ethiopian war proved no deterrent to Egyptian pilgrims and were counterbalanced by a more friendly atmosphere resulting impicwed Saudi-Egyptian relations and also by the vigorous propaganda carried out by the Banque misr. Transport was again provided by the Banque misr’s subsidiary company ££ Societe misr pour le Transport et la Navigation,” in accordance with the twenty years’ concession granted in 1932. Suez Canal. 357. Relations between the Egyptian Government and the Suez Canal Company were far from harmonious during the past year. 358. On the 23rd April an agreement was reached and embodied in a decree whereby (a) the company should pay a royalty of £E. 200,000 per annum to the Egyptian Government; (5) two Egyptians should join the board to fill, respectively, an existing vacancy and the next to occur amongst the French directors, and, should the total number of directors be increased in the future, a third Egyptian should be one of those appointed ; and {c) that the company should appoint Egyptians to at least one out of every three vacancies occurring on its staff so that by 1958 25 per cent, of the staff should be Egyptian. 359. In return for these concessions the Egyptian Government agreed {a) that in respect of the maximum dues which the company is entitled to levy (10 fr. per ton and 10 fr. per passenger), the franc should be defined as being 3-8575 piastres tariff; (b) to increase the maximum of 38-575 piastres tariff on the demand of the company subject only to the stipulation that the maximum should never exceed the value in piastres of 3-278875 grammes of gold of 875/1,000 fineness; and (c) that in the event of a modification of the maximum, the company should have the right to change the dues without giving the customary three months' notice prescribed in the firman of the 5th January, 1856. 360. This agreement (as embodied in the decree) was passed by the Council of Ministers and was signed by King Fuad a few hours before his death, on the 28th April, and on the same date a ministerial “arrete ” was issued by the Ministry of Finance fixing the maximum due at 63 piastres tariff (the equivalent m piastres tariff at that date of 3-278875 grammes of gold of 875/1,000 fineness).

Religious Freedom. 365. Early in 1936 the Egypt Intermission Council approached the High Commissioner on the subject of making provision for religious minorities in the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations. The council argued that anti-Christian agitations during the last five years provided adequate grounds for a reconsidera tion of the attitude adopted in 1930 by His Majesty’s Government when it was decided not to raise the question of minorities or of religious freedom during the treaty negotiations. 366. In reporting on the subject to His Majesty’s Government in February, the High Commissioner suggested that it would probably be difficult, in view of our abstention in 1930, to insist now, as part of a treaty settlement, on safeguards for minorities or guarantees for religious freedom, but that it might be possible to secure such guarantees through the League of Nations on the admission of Egypt, as was done in the case of Iraq. 367. In reply, His Majesty’s Government declared that, in their opinion, the best method of safeguarding the interests of minorities, would be by action at an opportune moment by the League of Nations. Further, Mr. Paton of the International Missionary Council was advised by the Foreign Office that the best procedure would be for him to approach the League direct in a letter to the Secretary-General. 368. Subsequently, however, after further consideration it was thought that such an application alone by the International Missionary Council to the League, unsupported by some State member of the League, might be ineffective. It was considered unlikely that any State would support in the League Assembly a demand for minority guarantees from Egypt. 369. It was, therefore, suggested that a way out of the difficulty might be to persuade the Egyptian Government themselves to volunteer some satisfactory statement to the League simultaneously with the submission of their application for membership. 370. As a result of an exchange of views between the Foreign Office and the Residency, it was decided to warn the Egyptian Government that the question of religious equality was likely to be raised at Geneva when Egypt applied for membership and to suggest to Nahas, in a friendly and informal manner, that the Egyptian Government should give an undertaking at the time of Egypt’s election to the League that the articles in the Egyptian Constitution guaranteeing religious liberty would be observed' in future. 371 It was considered that the submission of such a statement by the Egyptian Government to the League should provide a locus standi for the council to take the matter up in future in the League if Egypt failed to implement her promise. 372 A message in this sense was accordingly conveyed to Nahas, whose attention was drawn to the disabilities under which non-Moslems m Egypt suffer as the result of legislation which in some respects is inconsistent with the articles regarding religious liberty in the Constitution. 373. Nahas appeared to receive the suggestion sympathetically and stated that he would study the question with the object of preparing a suitable statement to be made, apparently spontaneously, by the Egyptian Government at the time of her application to the League.Greek Orthodox Community. q '74 On the 11th February Nicolas, Bishop of Hermopolis, was elected C reek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria. The elections were, however boycotted by the Orthodox Syrians, whose dispute with the Greek majority m the Churc still remained unsettled. 375. It will be remembered that the Egyptian Government had allowed the natriarchal elections to proceed only on condition that the Patriarch-elect should, as soon as possible after his election, produce a new Organic Law giving satisfac tion to reasonable Syrian demands, and it was stipulated that until he did so, he would not be accorded official recognition by the Egyptian Government. 376 For some time after the elections no progress was made in settling the dispute but towards the end of the year it was reported that as a result o± discussions entered into between committees representing the two parties agree ment had been practically reached on all points except on that of the proportion of Syrian electors in the electoral college. This was, however a fundamental point and one on which agreement appeared to be still remote. The Patriarchate had, however, made considerable concessions to the Syrians and it was hoped at the end of the year that a final settlement on the basis of these concessions might not long be delayed, so that the Egyptian Government’s Berat of Investiture might be issued to the Patriarch.

Lamfson to Mr. Eden.—[Received May 25.) (No. 545.) Sir, Cairo, May 13, 1936. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the annual report for 1935. During my absence on leave Mr. Kelly was in charge of the Residency as Acting High Commissioner from the 3rd August to the 30th September. 2 . The intricacies of a difficult and delicate situation, the unceasing pressure of urgent current work, and the additional work arising out of the treaty conversations, have rendered the compilation of this report exceptionally difficult this year. It was, indeed, not until the Easter holidays that it was possible seriously to attempt to complete it. 3. The outstanding feature of the year in internal politics was the drift towards the Wafd, traceable to Nessim Pasha’s abolition of the 1930 Constitution, and his failure to form a strong and comprehensive Government. The steady deterioration of the situation culminated in the formation in November of a “ united front ” of all the political leaders, demanding the return of the 1923 Constitution and the resumption of treaty negotiations. In the face of these and other developments, British opposition to the return of the 1923 Constitution could not be maintained. On the 13th December the Constitution was restored and the return of the Wafd to power became inevitable. 4 . From the end of June internal developments were increasingly affected by the tension resulting from the Italian dispute with the League over Abyssinia, the concentration of formidable Italian forces in Libya, and the counter-measures taken by His Maiestv’s Government involving the arrival of the Mediterranean Fleet in Alexandria on the 2nd September, the despatch of Royal Air Force and later on, military reinforcements to Egypt and the despatch of British and Egyptian troops to Mersa Matruh, Solium, Sidi Barrani and Siwa m the Westei Desert where advanced aerodromes were also established The greatest care was taken to secure Egyptian collaboration and goodwill m all the measures taken to meet the emergency. Noteworthy was the decision by His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom that preliminary arrangements should be worked out of which the Prime Minister was informed in general terms, for the joint establ sh- ment if necessary, of British martial law and Egyptian etat de siege, instead of ’ lv Irtish declaration In all these measures the wholehearted willingness to co-operate with the Residency shown by Nessim Pasha was of the greatest value. Unfortunately, these measures could not, by their nature, be ma e mown Ep-votian public which, in the absence of any statement by Nessim, remained pfey P t 0 the wildest suspicions of His Majesty’s Government s intentions. 5 Nessim Pasha’s position was not an enviable one. Faced on the one hand mentioned above he was encouraged to remain. fi While Nessim’s Government could never have been other than a stop-gap, and must eventual vTn any circumstances have fallen owing to the combination of the Kkg’s hostility and'Nessim’s personal inclination towards the Wafd, the 8687 [133991 £££3. P0 -. 170CTU )fA Oi-HCh!march of events was both accelerated and complicated by the development of Italian aggression against Abyssinia, and the prominence given to the role assumed byHis Majesty’s Government in that matter. From the survey given m Darasraphs 24—28 within it will be seen that a wave of excitement, largely inspired by fear swept over the country m July and August, and the resolute taciturnity., of Nessim coupled with his obstinate refusal to have any truck with a venal and^ unscrupulous press, left the inflammable field open to tFe ^gents of ltaiy and G# palace—-the former primarily interested m creating difficulties for His Majesty s Government, the latter willing to use any weapon against ^essim. The result was an incessant press campaign for a military alliance wl f tl J h ^ r 1 e q28 B r l onstitution e followed by treaty negotiations) and the restoration of the 1923 Constitution. The alleged pretext for these demands was the probability that Egypt would become involved willy-nilly in an Anglo-Italian war, and must not be dragged in as a “ labour corps.'” there was hardly any direct pro-Italian propaganda, which, indeed, would have been infinitely preferable from our and ^essim s points of view. 7 On the 31st August the Prime Minister called on the Acting High Commissioner and proposed that His Majesty’s Government should give an assurance of willingness in principle to resume treaty negotiations on the basis of previous drafts as soon as the international crisis was over. He made it clear that this proposal was instigated by Nahas (who was being much inconvenienced by the pressure of his own Left Wing, who had adopted the press slogans), and that its acceptance would at least satisfy Nahas and his chief colleagues. Nessim reverted several times to this proposal, and only abandoned it with expressions of deep regret when he found it was inacceptable. On the 5th December the Secretary of State, speaking in the House of Commons, announced that His Majesty’s Government looked forward to the establishment of Anglo-Egyptian relations on a permanent footing, mutually satisfactory, that the whole matter was receiving earnest and constant consideration, and that they had no intention of letting the matter drift, but found it obviously impossible in the midst of their Abyssinian preoccupations simultaneously to engage in negotiations in a matter of such importance. 8. This assurance was precisely what Nessim had asked for in August, but the position had meantime steadily deteriorated, and great impetus to this process had been given by a speech delivered by the Liberal leader, Mohamed Mahmoud, on the 7th November, violently attacking Nessim Pasha for his subservience to the British. The reception given to a reference to the constitutional question by Sir Samuel Hoare in his Guildhall speech on the 9th November showed that trouble was brewing. On their fete day on the 13th November the Wafd announced the withdrawal of their support for Nessim Pasha, and this proved to be the signal for students’ strikes and riots, the Liberal students demanding a treaty first and then a Constitution; the Wafdist the return of the 1923 Constitu tion and then resumption of treaty negotiations. Between the 13th November and the 22nd November the students were in an ugly mood, and thirteen members of the public and 159 police, who were occasionally obliged to use firearms, were injured. Of the students, five were killed, one of whom was made a martyr and a monument was erected in the precincts of the university to his memory, while 105 were injured. Student demonstrations continued intermittently until the middle of December, and were still mildly effervescing at the end of the year, and the geneial temper was such that Sir Samuel Hoare’s promise of eventual treaty negotiations, referred to above, passed almost unnoticed. Had circumstances permitted of such an assurance when Nessim first suggested it on the 31st August, the course of subsequent events might have been greatly modified. 9. At this stage a sudden development towards the union of all the parties took place, a “ d the United Front ” was formed to demand from King Fuad the t u r L° f i ^ 1923 CopsUttiUoih m favour of which His Majesty had somewhat the 1930 draft Clared hlmSelf ln A P rll &gt; and from the British a treaty on the lines of w 1 ?' nl ? anwll i 1 e, faced with a clearly expressed desire of King Fuad, ad already decided to resign, but to have allowed him to do so would in the circumstances have been dangerous. His resignation would have been attributed directly to British opposition to the 1923 Constitution. Nessim Pasha was there-3 9^ H [13399] foie informed that neither Sir Samuel Hoare’s Guildhall speech nor his subsequent statement in Parliament of the 5th December was intended to impose a veto on the 1923 Constitution. He promptly presented a petition to King Fuad, and the Constitution was restored on the 13th December. 11. Mahmoud Pasha and the other minority leaders were furious at being 3f)rived of the chance of office, but Nessim Pasha, in the unexpected barque which had saved him, somewhat unsteadily paddled out the year. 12. A disturbing feature of the year was the way in which the various political parties exploited the turbulent and undisciplined propensities of both students and school children as a means of proclaiming their dissatisfaction with the state of local and Anglo-Egyptian politics. 13. The international tension and the measures taken to meet it led to a revival of the demand for the modernisation of the Egyptian army. Concrete proposals were therefore worked out involving the allotment of four Vickers and sixteen light automatic machine guns to each Egyptian battalion, safeguarded by the appointment of sixteen British officers and fourteen non-commissioned officers to help train the Egyptians in the use of the weapons. The Prime Minister accepted the proposals without demur, but the Inspector-General, Egyptian Army, was not really enthusiastic, the Minister of War jibbed at the extra British personnel, and with the development of the internal political crisis the proposals were dropped. 14. In October, while no pressure was put on the Egyptian Government, they were informed that, if the League invited their participation in sanctions, His Majesty’s Government would protect them from the consequences of Italy’s annoyance. The Egyptian Government replied to the League invitation that they would adhere in principle to the measures taken by way of sanctions in the Italo- Ethiopian dispute, and that their application would be effected within the limits of what was possible. This decision of the Egyptian Government was taken primarily to demonstrate their solidarity with His Majesty’s Government, and, though it was actively discouraged in the press, in implementing the decision the Egyptian Government went a good deal further than had at first been thought possible or had been expected. The sanctions applied were economic, not financial. 15. The vexatious question of the public debt, now, it may be hoped, happily disposed of, was a source of trouble throughout the year, involving on the one hand attempts to secure French acquiescence in a permanent settlement out of court and on the other constant vigilance to prevent the Egyptian Government taking the law into their own hands and needlessly provoking the French. The acquiescence of the French was nearly obtained in April, but the negotiations failed owing to French insistence on the abandonment by the Egyptian Govern ment of a draft decree dealing with gold clauses in private contracts. The breakdown of the negotiations led His Majesty’s Government to agree to the issue of the private debts decree, and the French Government entered an unavailing protest against its application to French subjects as a violation ot caoitulatorv rights. Broadly speaking, the French have gained nothing by their attitude in } this and previous years but the ill will of the Egyptians who have been dealing with the question. 16 Trade and relations between Egypt and the Sudan were satisfactory. The outstanding event of the year was the visit of the Egyptian trade mission to the Sudan In November the Banque Misr directors also visited Khartum and tarious economic centres. I myself made my first visit to the Sudan from the 10th February to the 2nd March. 17. Revenue returns in Egypt were buoyant and the financial y^r ended with a surplus of £E. 2,260,753 on the State budget and of £E. 91 865 on the budget of the Egyptian State railways, despite supplementary estimates for more thaf£H million Important steps were taken during the year to give additional relief to rural debtors. 18 Egypt’s continued economic recovery ^ a % refl , ecte 1 d Q o i ? f^tt 1935 ct^KHcs available Exports in the cotton year—September 1934-August 1935— were £E. 32,197 000 against £E. 31,057,000 in the previous year, and nnportswere £E 30 741,000 against £E. 28,023,000. The cotton crop of 1935 was estimated to exceed last year’s crop by 750,000 kantars, at bet ^ prices, with the result that the tempo of importation was quickening at the end of the year. 19 The United Kingdom export trade to Egypt showed a decline in the- proportional share of the total, the position of Japan and ^ermany notaU. improving;. An Egyptian mission of economic enquiry, under the chairmanship of Hafez Afifi Pasha, visited the United Kingdom in April to study the commercial relationships of the two countries. The first result was the denuncia tion by Egypt of her commercial treaty with Japan, as a preliminary to the negotiation of a new treaty intended to check Japanese competition in cotton piece-goods. Sir Geoffrey Corbett was appointed adviser to the new Ministry of Economics in May. 20. There was a real improvement in the relations of the Mixed Courts with the Government, marred only by an ill-advised incursion into politics by certain Egyptian judges of the Cairo Mixed Court in November. 21. The Advisory Committee on Education in Cairo made considerable progress during the year in the examination of the problem of British education in Egypt. In commemoration of His Majesty King George V’s Jubilee, appeals were issued for the new girls’ school in Alexandria, where £E. 50,000 was raised to add to the £10,000 granted by the Treasury, and for the English School, Cairo, where £E. 22,000 was collected. 22. The total number of serious crimes throughout the country increased from 6,860 in 1934 to 7,415 in 1935, a check to improvement being caused by the too frequent dismissals and moves of mudirs, other high officials and omdahs. The total number of crimes, including minor delits and contraventions, in which Europeans were concerned decreased from 6,268 in 1934 to 5,005 in 1935, but murders rose from seven to ten. Capital punishment was awarded in twenty-four cases as against eighteen last year. The police had a particularly trying time towards the end of the year, and it was a welcome sign that the Minister of Finance agreed to a five-year plan of building and expenditure to improve their conditions of service. 23. Real progress was made in the enforcement of the wireless law and the prevention of the unauthorised reception and publication of wireless news messages By October most of the important newspapers had come into line though the Mokattam, the Gehad and Rose-el-Youssef held out Old Dr Nimr of the remained the £t nigger in the woodpile.” On the 14th April the Irench bociete Radio Orient were suspended by the Egyptian Government for flagrant breaches of the International Telegraph Regulations.

The situation in Egypt at the beginning of the year was outwardly calm, but Nessim’s failure to form a strong comprehensive Government had caused general disappointment among the moderate elements, and the belief was that the Wafd had greatly improved its position since his advent to omce. Inis impression was strengthened by the success of the Wafd Congress °n ^e 9th and 10th January, which was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of over 16 000 people. Outstanding items of Nahas Pasha’s speech at the congress were insistence on the return of the 1923 Constitution, and the desire to establish friendly Anglo- Egyptian relations on a treaty basis. 2 The High Commissioner returned to Egypt on the 9th January. The Palace continued consistently to obstruct the Government of Nessim and to hamper the ordinary routine of administration. The Wafd were now showing signs of impatience. Nessim appeared to be trying to steer a middle course and to^avoid offending either the King or the Popular party, possibly m expectation of the early establishment of a Regency Council.. The wise course, in the uncertainty arising out of the precarious state of His Majesty’s heal h, seemed to be for His Majesty’s Government to wait on events while discreetly helping [13399]«■ I i 1 Nessim without appearing to take political side^ At same time Sir Miles Lampson lost no opportunity, m his talks with the Kmg^ana ^ at“.S«V4u“N'±S“iV »Ati b, .he British as a bridge to a Wafd Administration. 3 During these discussions the High Commissioner had stressed the ’ • rt collaboration between Great .Britain and. ttf and expressed'the'hopeTthat. 1 this would eventually lead to an invitation Horn His Majesty’s Government to the Egyptian Government to send a qualified mission to England to explore possibilities. 4. Meanwhile, Nessim’s difficulties owing particularly to Palace obstruc tion, continued to’ increase. The High Commissioner had ^^ “1 the S January advised the King to consider Ibrashi’s P-motbn to Although Ibrashi now had less general and direct access to the Ministries his continued presence at the Palace provoked general resentment among all political parties. Ziwer Pasha, as head of the King’s Cabinet exercised no influence whatever. The King pursued his usual tactics of sowing dissension among Cabinet Ministers by attracting some of them to his cause. His Majesty further opposed Nessim in the questions of the Azhar and the University. Elementary justice required the reinstatement of Luth Bey El Saved as rector of the university, and only the appointment of a strong and independent sheikh, such as El Maraghi, as rector of the Azhar, would save that institution from degenerating into a centre of Wafdist intrigue. But the King successfully opposed both these appointments. 5. On the 10th February the High Commissioner left for the Sudan, returning to Cairo on the 2nd March. 6. By the latter date it was apparent that the drift towards the Wafd had accelerated. Nahas was reported to have expressed the opinion that he expected to head a Wafd Government within three months, and that one of his first acts would be to revive the treaty issue. Nessim had, according to the Minister of Public Works, adopted the line that he did not intend to quarrel with the Wafd on his own initiative. On the 6th March Sir Miles Lampson discussed the situation with Nessim and informed him that although we did not wish openly to appear as opponents of the Wafd, we did not want to see the Wafd in power. Asked for his views, Nessim replied that his policy was complete co-operation with Great Britain, and also to work in harmony with all political parties in Egypt. He now admitted, however, that the Wafd were not prepared to support him in his policy of working with all parties; he therefore contemplated resignation. Authority had meanwhile been obtained from His Majesty’s Government to support Nessim in any attempt he might make to include desirable political elements in his Cabinet, to give him advice freely; and to secure, if possible, beneficial reforms for Egypt. Nessim appeared at the moment to be the only man able to handle the situation on a non-party basis. The High Commissioner therefore urged him to reflect before deciding to resign and again advised him to strengthen his Cabinet by the inclusion of sound moderate elements. 7 The King’s health remained an enigma. His Majesty still looked drawn and shrunken, but his mind was as alert as ever. On the 12th March His Majesty when discussing the situation, took the line that he had been forced into the background by us and was now only an interested spectator; and that Nessim dared not make the slightest move without Residency advice. At this audience nkL Ml La i npS °u refer J ed , t0 th e necessity of giving Prince Farouk a better unresponsAe atl ° na ^ ^ ° f Sendmg him to En g land &gt; but His Majesty was and a^ainEron^UCk^ 11 th T at the P osition had becom e impossible informed him that he botvAvi lr y l-aiiipson again advised patience and proposed tUoly^tuSfon o?

This appointment was made on the 11th April, and the post was offered to Sir Geoffrey L. Corbett. Nahas protested to Nessim against + he appointment, but the majority of the Wafd decided to refrain for the time -^eing from attacking the Cabinet on that issue. Another matter discussed at the Wafd meeting was the appointment of Hafez Afifi as president of the Egyptian Trade Mission, which sailed for England on the 30th March. The Wafd subsequently protested to Nessim against this appointment, but did not press their objection in the face of the Prime Minister’s persistence in maintaining it. 9. Early in April Palace attacks in the press against Nessim were accentuated and the King was reported to be determined to bring back some sort of Constitution. The “ Ittehad ” (Palace) party at a meeting on the 5th April attacked the Government for its abolition of constitutional guarantees and for truckling to the British. Attempts were made to unite the Shaab, Ittehad and Watanist parties against the Government, and Nahas was approached by emissaries of the Palace with a view to the return of the Constitution. 10. On the 11th April the Azhar question was disposed of temporarily by closing the institution. But the unpopular Rector, Sheikh Mohamed El Ahmaday- el-Zawahir, had not yet resigned, and the King’s obstruction remained. Authority had now, however, been received to secure by means of verbal repre sentations to the King the removal of Ibrashi, but only in support of an initiative undertaken by Nessim. The latter accordingly on the 17th April addressed a. letter to His Majesty reviewing the situation^ and praying for His Majesty’s support to overcome difficulties caused by the obstruction of certain irresponsible elements. The letter contained a reference to the fact that the Government was carrying out its reforms in conformity with constitutional principles, and until a constitutional regime was established in the country—either the 1923 Constitu tion, if necessary amended according to its own provisions if His Majesty thought that such amendment was in the public interest or a new Constitution. His Majesty seized this opportunity to reply in a rescript, dated the 20th April, that he was in favour of the 1923 Constitution. 11 Meanwhile, Nessim, when handing his letter of the 17th April to the King; had obtained His Majesty’s consent to a satisfactory solution of the Azhar uroblem by the removal of the unpopular Sheikh El Zawahin, but His Majesty had asked not to be pressed regarding Ibrashi. The High Commissioner therefore took the matter up with His Majesty at an audience arranged on the afternoon of the same day, and obtained His Majesty’s promise to transfer Ibrashi to a post abroad. At this audience the-King stated that he had finally decided to send Prince Farouk to England. 12. On the 22nd April Ibrashi tendered his resignation and two days later was appointed Minister at Brussels. 13 At the end of the month the problems of the Azhar and the university had been folved satisfactorily by the appointments of Sherkh A1 Maraghi and Lutfi-el-Sayed Bey respectively. _ 14 On the 1st May it was learned that King Fuad had intimated to '-p. i j i i mimt forthwith resigm his post as head of the King s Cabinet ^Subsequently His Majesty informed the High Commissioner that he Cabinet. buDse( l^ eil ^{’ , PTlfiT i pti J c intermediary between the Palace and the ^^fltv^ratime when Xef collaboration ^as necessary, and suggested Residency •, nio f nT &gt; iVia nost However His Maiesty postponed Aly Maher Pasha as more smtabte “ P^Xrifter consultation with His a decision m the matter for a _ ^ possibility that Nessim Majesty’s Government f “ f emded ^ bet Jto accept the might not be able much longer to oppose Uie W aMAL Maher .

Nessim continue give the Wafd temporising answers, arguing that the proces^s of r^gamsing and strengthening the Administration was not yet complete, that the Kin &amp; s Jiea still Sve cafse for anxiety, &amp;c. At the same time Nessim strongly urged with the High Commissioner the advisability of not estranging pe Wafd completely. Finally under constant pressure from the Wafd and the Palace, Nessim, after an interview with Nahas decided on the 18th May to resign. Ihe High Com- missioner endeavoured to dissuade him, but succeeded only to the extent that he ncrrpf'H to earrv on until the end of the month. 16. The question of Nessim’s successor had now acquired urgency The choice lay between Aly Maher and Mohamed Mahmoud. The latter, though perhaps a stronger man and certainly with a larger following in the country, was opposed by the King. Aly M^aher, more subtle and adaptable, had already expressed views which were very promising, and he had the support of His Majesty. It was felt, therefore, that he was the more suitable. His Majesty s Government approved of the choice, but added that if Nessim persisted in resigning the formation of a purely Palace Government should be prevented. On the 22nd May Sir Miles Lampson explained to Nessim that the opposition of His Majesty’s Government to the return of the 1923 Constitution was based on the considerations (a) that it had not worked in practice; (t&gt;) that to re-introduce it would bring the Wafd back automatically into office. His Majesty’s Govern ment did not, however, consider themselves committed to keep the Wafd out if elections under some Constitution other than 1923 returned them to power. Nessim seemed impressed. He was then given a formula as a possible solution of the constitutional issue. The formula was to the effect that no one was opposed to the return, at a suitable time, to parliamentary life. It was for the Government to study the constitutional question in all its aspects and try to find a new Constitution which really suited the true needs of Egypt, to be put into force at the proper time. It was for the Government to elaborate the Constitution, preferably with a drafting committee, comprising, if possible, elements of all parties. Nessim appeared pleased with the formula, but stated he must ascertain the views of the Wafd. He proposed, he said, to do this cautiously, and to try gradually to gain their approval. If he failed, he must resign. 17. On the 1st June Nessim, with three colleagues, met Nahas, Makram, Nokrashi and Ahmed Maher, and showed them the formula. The Wafd leaders noted with interest that the British were not opposed to a Constitution, and agreed not to oppose Nessim on condition that he sent a letter to the Residency protesting against British interference in the internal affairs of Egypt. To this Nessim agieed, and his letter duly arrived on the 4th June. It was a thoroughly unsatisfactoiy document. It pilloried His Majesty’s Government as interfering m internal affairs contrary to solemn declarations, and as opposing a return to a constitutional regime which the King, the Egyptian Government and people all desn-ed. It inferred that the 1923 Constitution was desired; and it completely Ignored all oral condemnations of the 1923 Constitution so often expressed by the Prime Minister. The High Commissioner sent for Nessim, and, taking him severe y o as .advised the withdrawal of the letter. Nessim was unable to do mnsidkahw ed t0 le¥lse a 11 and t0 V 631 as a draft - Subsequently, after considerable discussion and revision, the draft was reduced to a fairly anodyne find’the’draftunacceiitflh? 3 mformed , that His Majesty’s Government might still the Wafd he « a ^ h e ’ ex P ressed a deslre to drop the matter altogether.

In the meantime the concensus of opinion was that the Wafd might, on balance, lose by Nessim’s continuance in office. 18. On the 22nd June King Fuad enquired whether we had any objection to the appointment of Aly Maher as head of the King’s Cabinet, and appeared gieatly pleased when informed that we had none. His Majesty also spoke about Prince Farouk s impending visit to England which, His Majesty stated, had been delayed by the financial troubles of Hassanein Bey. 19. Towards the end of June there were indications of a difference of opinion in the ranks of the Wafd and a tendency to rebel against Nahas’s and Makram’s policy of refraining from embarrassing the Prime Minister over the constitutional issue. Public attention was, however, now being diverted from local politics to the Abyssinian crisis. 20. On the 27th June the Wafd, as a result of discussions lasting three days, issued a manifesto on the Constitutional issue. In this manifesto, which was couched in unusually moderate terms, the Wafd accused His Majesty’s Government of opposing the return of the Constitution but absolved Nessim from all blame and decided to continue supporting him. The publication of this manifesto relieved the political tension of the preceding weeks; the press campaign for the return of the Constitution became less violent; and Nessim had ensured himself at least temporarily against active opposition from the Wafd. Palace opposition, however, although less in evidence at the moment, remained a constant danger to Nessim’s Government. 21. Aly Maher was duly appointed head of King Fuad’s Cabinet on the 1st July. He made clear at once his opinion that Nessim’s Government had no stability and should be strengthened or should resign. King Fuad, who was smarting under a strong sense of humiliation against Nessim, had been converted to inclusion, if Nessim went, of more representative elements, including Hafez Afifi and Ali Shamsy, but took the line that it was for His Majesty’s Government to take any necessary action to get rid of Nessim, His Majesty having completely relapsed into the background. These views amounted to a definite invitation to get rid of Nessim. The implication, though never mentioned, was that Aly Maher should take his place. It was, however, no longer the case that Nessim himself wished to resign, and it was felt that to work directly for his resignation would be impolitic and hardly fair in view of his constant amenability. The possibility of the King’s death was a factor which could not be overlooked in this connexion, and the conclusion reached at this time was not to force the issue, but to let Nessim go if events led him to offer his resignation. The alternative of a Government under Mohamed Mahmoud was at this period felt to be precarious owing to the improbability of his being able to work harmoniously with the King if we were able to impose him. 22. Shortly afterwards the Prime Minister gave proof of his continued receptiveness by undertaking to effect the appointment of extra British po ice officers in the Canal Zone for search purposes, the appointment of a British second-in-command in the Frontiers Administration, and to assist m several other matters; and Aly Maher was subsequently given to ‘ Commissioner was definitely not m favour of any change of Government at the moment. 90 n n the 8 th Julv the Prime Minister in connexion with a request by thp Italian Minister for an assurance that the Canal would not be closed to Ita y n'hfevent “lltL with Abyssinia expressed his grye anxiety regardxng Egypt’s position and asked whether ““f^n Tbsequently us for protection agai Maicstv’s Government (in confirmation the territory of Egypt.24 The position when the High Commissioner went on leave on the 3rd Wust was that Aly Maher had obtained King Fuad’s agreement that there should be no change of Government for the time being and that events should be allowed to develop and the situation be reconsidered m the autumn. A similar undertaking existed with the Wafd who had tacitly suspended pressure om* Nessim for the restoration of the Constitution. Signs had however, already appeared in the press of a disposition to urge the Egyptian public to profit from the international situation to extract national desiderata from Great Britain and from the beginning of August a systematic daily campaign was conducted on these lines, led by the Ahram : , but with the left wing Wafdist Rose-el-Youssef and the reputedly Palace Balag'h following close behind. The essential points of this campaign—which rapidly infected the whole press, circulations increasing in proportion with the violence of the paper were that His Majesty s Govern ment were dragging a supine Egyptian Government into war; that Egypt s co-operation was indispensable to His Majesty’s Government, and that the duty of the Egyptian Government was to restore the 1923 Constitution and to demand a military alliance at once to be followed without delay by resumed negotiations for a treaty. The Wafdist Rose-el-Y oussef specialised in attacking the Wafd leaders, Nahas and Makram Obeid, for their support of Nessim’s passive attitude. 25. There was little doubt that subsidies played an important part in the launching of this press campaign which eventually transformed the whole Egyptian scene. The Prime Minister and his more active Ministers were convinced that the funds were supplied through the Palace agents, though mainly furnished from Italian sources, and indications from other sources tended to confirm this belief, though no definite proofs could be obtained. Unfortunately the Prime Minister adopted a disdainful inactivity towards the agitation in its early stages, refusing either to use counter-financial measures (he had stopped all press subsidies on coming into office) or to use any personal influence with the journalists who became increasingly exasperated by his silence under their persistent attacks. 26. The first effects of the press campaign on the mind of the members of the Government became evident when the Finance Minister on the 21st August raised the question of war preparedness in the Council of Ministers, demanding an understanding whereby Egypt would volunteer all her assets but as £C a friend not as a slave. ’ ’ The growth of this feeling of uneasiness was greatly promoted by panic due to the Government being in Alexandria and was intensified by the arrival of the Mediterranean Fleet, and on the 31st August the Prime Minister called on the Acting High Commissioner to propose that His Majesty’s Govern ment should give an assurance of willingness in principle to resume treaty negotiations on the basis of previous drafts as soon as the international crisis was over. The Egyptian Government would negotiate with the help of a council representative of all parties. Alternatively he proposed to summon a council of this character and ask it to pronounce on Egypt’s role vis-a-vis Italy and Abyssinia. A week later he produced a note which he wished to present to King Fuad providing in detail for the immediate convocation of a Council of State on the lines already suggested. On the 13th September the Acting High Commissioner communicated to the Prime Minister an official assurance from His Majesty s Government that if the occasion arose His Majestv’s Government would keep the Egyptian Government informed and enter into consultation with them regarding any developments of the international situation which might closely concern Egypt The message had a soothing effect on the members°of the Government, but fell flat m the press as the agitation in the latter had long Pr^p f 16 f ge °a f e l ely askm £ for consul tation and information.

On the 9th September, however, under instructions from the Secretary of State, Mr. Kelly saw the King and asked for His Majesty’s assistance—if possible by some action which would dissipate current suspicions—in combating the propaganda which constituted both an interference in the internal affairs of Egypt and an inadmissible intervention in Anglo-Egyptian relations. King Fuad’s attitude was unsatisfactory; His Majesty maintained that he had no influence on the press, could not answer for his entourage, and could not give a blank cheque in favour of Nessim. Immediately afterwards he sent several messages through Aly Maher (on learning the impression created by his replies) to the effect that he had misunderstood the point and that he had the best intentions : and at a subsequent audience on the 16th September he gave Mr. Kelly definite assurances of unstinted support to the Prime Minister in combating propaganda and that he would warn all his entourage to avoid all contacts calculated to create suspicion of anti-British intrigues. An assurance was also given through Aly Maher that in the event of a breach between England and Italy all Italians connected with the Palace, including the King’s doctor, would be sent away. Unfortunately, the press campaign had become an established movement, with its own reward in the form of increased circulation and a revived political excitement in the intelligentsia, and no longer required any secret stimulus ; and neither the increased circumspection of the Palace nor the Prime Minister’s belated decision to allow the Ministry of the Interior limited funds for counter-propaganda were able to exercise restraining influence on the passions which had been let loose or the twist which had been given to public opinion. 28. On the 30th September Sir Miles Lampson resumed charge, and two days later took the opportunity for a frank discussion with His Majesty regarding the unsatisfactory situation which had arisen out of the anti-British propaganda campaign organised by the Italians in Egypt during the preceding month, and warned His Majesty that the activities, in this connexion, of his entourage, notably of Verucci Bey, could not be tolerated. His Majesty, while denying that others of his staff were involved, agreed reluctantly to curb the political activities of Yerucci Bey. His Majesty pleaded his readiness to work loyally for Egypt and Great Britain, but vehemently attacked Nessim for consistently failing to keep him informed and complained that he had been reduced to a cypher. 29 On the 6th October Prince Farouk sailed from Alexandria for England. The Prince and his suite, under the charge of Mohamed Hassanem Bey, were conveved on H.M.S. Devonshire to Port Said, where they embarked on the P. and O. liner Strathaird, bound for Tilbury. His Royal Highness and party reached England on the 18th October. 30. On the 12th October the Egyptian Government and the Residency returned from Alexandria to Cairo. 31 During the first two weeks in October the campaign against Nessim abated considerably. Genuine anxiety among the public at the defencelessness nf Ffwot in the crisis arising out of the Italo-Abyssiman conflict was relieved to some extent by the presence at Alexandria of British warships m impressive L u Ttnliqn nrnnacanda appeared to slacken, due, it was reported, to the numbers. y. a ] a ' P^lTditoe had proved more effective in France than in realisation that heavy expeiid -u P Nessim and was able temporarl i y to « r i.j B» .h. ? ™.

Nessim appeared impressed and promised to defer his decision. During the next few days the situation became easier. But developments in another direction now threatened the Government. Ihe minority parties, including the Liberal Constitutionalists, W atamsts, Shaabists, Ittehadists and Saadist Wafdists, had come to a secret understanding to indulge in an extremist campaign to embarrass the W^afd and the Cabinet. Iheir attack was to be supported by extremists in the Wafd itself and by Akkad. The news paper Balagh was also involved, indicating Palace support. It was possible that the Wafd’s sudden ultimatum of the 18th October was dictated by a knowledge that this ill-assorted alliance was about to attack the Government. 33. On the 6th November King Fuad returned to Cairo from Alexandria. 34. On the 7th November Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha delivered an important political speech before a large audience of about 12,000 people, including leaders and members of all parties except the Wafd. In this speech Mohamed Mahmoud severely criticised Nessim for his silence and his subservience to the British; asserted Egypt’s right and duty to defend its own territory; demanded the total suppression of the Capitulations; and urged Egyptians, in the existing critical situation, to unite without distinction of persons or parties. This speech may be considered definitely to have launched a political campaign of the minority leaders which culminated at the close of the year in the formation of the political United Front, and led to the subsequent resignation of Nessim’s Cabinet. 35. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government had approved the proposal that, in order to assist Nessim to strengthen his position, some statement of policy should be issued. No opportunity having occurred, however, before Parliament was prorogued, the Secretary of State made the announcement in his speech at the Lord Mayor’s banquet on the 9th November. In his speech, which was published by the Egyptian papers on the following day, Sir Samuel Hoare stated that His Majesty’s Government were not opposed to a Constitutional regime in Egypt, but that, when consulted, had advised against the re-enactment of the Constitutions of 1923 and 1930, since the one proved unworkable and the other universally unpopular. This statement was misinterpreted by the local press as indicating His Majesty’s Government’s definite opposition to any Constitution in Egypt and was vehemently criticised as further proof of British interference 13 h ^ ^ nterna ^ a E a i rs °f Egypt. It soon became evident that trouble was th. 7th A r 6 r A i ; 0Und 1 Mohamed Mahmoud, after his speech on the 7th November of all non-Wafdist elements, and of public knowledge that we were opposed to the 1923 Constitution, the Wafd felt that their influence in the as U chIm^ions b of n fhe h m at T e&lt; ?

Government employees were reported to be contemplating action in sympathy with the students. The police were not being supported by the judiciary. Their morale was being further under mined by vilification in the native press, who attacked especially the British personnel.. It was felt that if disorders spread ISTessim could not be counted on to maintain order. His departure would be a pity owing to his exceptional amenability and usefulness in getting war preparations through, such as the Fuka railroad, the proposed modernisation of the Egyptian army, and the attachment to it of additional British officers, &amp;c. But the machinations of King Fuad had resulted in aligning all parties, outside the Wafd, in a spurious union against Nessim and ourselves, with a consequent general deterioration in Anglo-Egyptian relations and the possibility of Italian exploitation of anti- British movements. And now that the Wafd had gone into opposition Nessim was in an unenviable position. Negotiations were in progress between the minority parties of the Wafd for the proposed formation of a united national front to resist so-called British encroachments on Egyptian independence. Fortunately for Nessim this attempt to unite the Wafd with the other parties did not at first meet with success. Nahas rejected overtures for a coalition There followed a split in the students’ ranks. Some favoured the Wafd with its slogan of “Constitution before Independence”; others were for Mohamed Mahmoud and his policy of “ Independence (Treaty) before Constitution.” By the end of November the split appeared complete. 38. Student demonstrations continued intermittently during the first half of December. Instigated first by the Wafd and later by Mohamed Mahmoud the students finally became an embarrassment and began to dictate to the party leaders. They threatened to continue the disorders until all parties, including the Wafd, agreed to form a united front. Nessim now felt he could no longer remain in office. King Fuad had on the 10th December made it clear that in the existing state of unrest His Majesty felt that a change of Government was necessary. The High Commissioner informed Nessim of His Majesty’s views and Nessim decided to resign. 39. Meanwhile a sudden and rapid development towards union between all parties had taken place. The agreement among them was that they should demand from the King the 1923 Constitution and from the British a treaty on the lines of 1930. It now seemed doubtful whether, if Nessim resigned, Ah Maher could form a strong Government and it was necessary to extricate ourselves -Prwm thA armpiaranoe of solitarv opposition to the demand for a particular Consti-14 political notabilities : Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha.

The Constitution of 1923 was restored by Royal rescript dated the 13th December 1935. On the following day there were demonstrations m Cairo, some to agitate for independence and a treaty, but most were of a peaceful nature to celebrate the return of the Constitution. 42. On the 17th December Nessim issued an official communique announcing his decision to take the members of the United Front into consultation on all matters of national importance. 43. An electoral law, identical except for minor alterations with that of 1924, was promulgated by Royal decree on the 20th December. 44. The university, the Azhar and all the schools which had been closed on account of students’ riots, were opened again at the end of December. Apart from a peculariarly obstreperous demonstration by some 4,000 students at the opening of the International Surgical Congress on the 31st December, there were no further disturbances and the year closed in a calmer and more hopeful atmosphere. Chapter II.— International Relations. A byssinia. 45. The Egyptian Government in early June were intending to raise the status of the Egyptian consulate at Addis Ababa to that of a Legation and made the necessary provision in the budget. The Italian Minister, however, got wind of the proposal and intimated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that if it were carried out it would give grave umbrage to the Italian Government. The suggestion seems to have been dropped, as a new Egyptian consul has since been appointed. 46. A peculiar situation arises out of the fact that Egypt while herself the subject of extra-territorial jurisdiction possesses such jurisdiction in Abyssinia. One result of this anomalous position is that an appeal by a foreigner, who, in w 011 ^ enjoy capitulatory rights against a decision of the Egyptian consul given in favour of an Egyptian, would come before the Egyptian Native Court of Appeal and not the Mixed Tribunals. The judicial adviser, however, does not regard this as a real invasion of capitulatory rights, since the court of appeal m such an eventuality would become ad hoc an Abyssinian court. 47. An Egyptian medical mission, seventy-five strong, under Nabil Ismail Daoud and representing “The Egyptian Committee for the Aid of Ethiopia, arrived m Addis Ababa on the 21st October. The mission was officially recognised by the Egyptian Government towards the end of November. A f ghamstan. P a f a § ra P h 56 of las * year’s report, the Afghan Govern- were Lnnointerl to “a f G ?

Germany. 51. The German share of Egyptian import trade showed a further advance as compared with 1934, 8-8 per cent, of the total supplies being secured as against 7-3 per cent, m the first nine months of the preceding year. Growing use is being made of barter transactions as a means of increasing German exports, a notable example being the private barter machinery set up by German cotton spinners and Alexandria cotton exporters through the intermediary of the Dresdner Bank. These have resulted in the settlement of over 50 per cent, of the “old debts” (in respect of cotton delivered up to September 1934) and in the absorption by Egypt of increasing quantities of German artificial nitrates. Italy. 52. Apart from the special considerations arising out of Egypt’s adherence to the economic sanctions drawn up by the League of Nations, the most important feature of the economic relations between the two countries was the difficulty in obtaining payment for cotton sold to Italy. At the end of June, an authoritative estimate placed the amount unsettled at approximately £E. 500,000. During July the position eased somewhat, and about 50 per cent, of back business was paid for, but at the end of the 1934-35 season about £E. 200,000 was still outstanding. Italian Propaganda. 53. Italian propaganda activities in Egypt were vigorously intensified as the campaign in Abyssinia developed. The Italians seemed to have two main objects in view, firstly to disturb Anglo-Egyptian relations, and, secondly, to popularise in Egypt the idea that Egypt’s best interests lay in preserving an attitude of strict neutrality towards the Ethiopian conflict. The futile task of creating a feeling of real sympathy for Italy among Egyptians in general was not seriously attempted, since it was realised that Egyptian suspicion of Italian imperialistic designs was too deeply rooted, and that no amount of direct propaganda could wean Egyptians from their fear and dislike of Italian methods of colonisation. 54. It was apparent that Italian propaganda agents in this country were supplied with ample funds by the home Government. They were able to offer lavish subsidies to newspaper editors in return for articles stressing the advisability of Egypt’s remaining neutral and nourishing the idea that Great Britain’s need was Egypt’s opportunity to press her claim for complete independence. This line of attack was made easier by the Prime Minister’s persistent disinclination to subsidise the local press himself, or even to keep it informed of the Government’s policy. A number of editors accepted Italian money offered directly or indirectly. It is interesting to observe that the principal offenders in this respect were the nominally independent newspapers, notably the Ahram, and those connected with the Palace, e.g., the Balagh; the official Wafdist papers, on the other hand, resisted Italian blandishments despite then tiaditional enthusiasm for the cause of Egyptian independence. 55. Considerable embarrassment was caused to His Majesty’s Government by the close contact which the King’s Italian architect, Verucci Bey, maintained with the Italian Legation. 56 An important part in Italian propagandist work was played by the “Anence d’Egypte et d’Orient ” (A.E.O.), a new agency set up m Cairo under the management of Signor Ugo Dadone, a former editor of the local Italian newspaper Giornale d’Oriente. It is estimated that this organisation s budgetI 1() nurux A -Pvinn month It printed and distributed to the srs I?-;®-ssarasfsssrsi supported by the Italian Legation. 5 h Y ° U fio^^fltiranCfce^s a^ntXtolowds %e expenses ‘of th™ antf Bi itish ' propaganda tour in Europe undertaken by its president and secretary m December. 58 Misleading reports and inflammatory speeches denouncing British policy in the Near East wefe teing broadcast daily by the wireless station at Bari, but it s doubtful wttto Egyptian public opinion XLrTmler' (sJe a s' attempts to rouse the Arab world against British imperialism (see also paragraphs 143-151 and 156).

Her share of the import trade in the first nine months rose from 11 7 per cent. (1934) to 13-6 pel cent. (1935). 60. Continued competition in those classes of cotton piece-goods, on the production of which the local textile industry depends for its piospeiity, has prompted the keen interest of the Egyptian Government in measures calculated to restrain the inward flow of low-priced and low-quality products. INotice was given in July to terminate the Egypto-Japanese Commercial Agreement after the expiry of the prescribed period of three months. During this period Japan was asked to restrict her cotton piece-goods imports to the average of the amounts imported in the corresponding period during the last three years. Little or no attention was paid by Japanese exporters to this restriction, .with the result that their three months’ quota was more than exhausted in less than two months. Prompt action was thereupon taken by the Egyptian Government, and a surtax of 40 per cent, was imposed on certain classes of cotton and artificial silk goods. Since the Japanese had indicated their desire to enter into negotiations for a new commercial agreement, the Egyptian Government waived their right to increase by 100 per cent, duties on Japanese products after the expiry of the commercial treaty. A Japanese delegation arrived in Egypt towards the end of October and negotiations were commenced. A hitch occurred when the Japanese refused to accept certain figures of cost of production submitted by the Egyptian side, and negotiations were suspended while instructions were sought from Tokyo. They were, however, quietly resumed after an interval of about a fortnight and, presumably, the point regarding which the dispute had arisen was not pressed. 61. It is believed to be the intention of the Egyptian Government to conclude with Japan some arrangement, covering Japanese purchases of raw cotton as well as Japanese exports of cotton piece-goods, similar to the arrangement concluded in 1934 between India and Japan. Palestine. 62. It was decided in March that the Palestine Government should open negotiations with Egypt with a view to increasing the interchange of trade between the two countries by means of tariff adjustments. A delegation visited gypt m May, and an agreement was negotiated which granted to Palestine reductions or modifications of duty on soap, melons, oranges and grapefruit, and to Egypt reductions of duty on melons and sugar, reduced railway rates on reductions^of'duty^on'freSi’vegetableP 1134 ’ 0118 ° n mang ° eS ’ ^ ^ Pr ° mlSe ° f 63 No progress was made during the year regarding; the signature of an extradition treaty between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom (on behalf of the Government of Palestine) and Egypt.

Switzerland. 66. M. Henri Martin presented his letters of credence as Swiss Minister on the 11th March, and on the 28th March King Fuad signed the decree ratifying the treaty of friendship between the two countries. M. Martin resides at Angora. The Yemen. 67. A tentative and semi-official suggestion was made in September from Palace sources that the Yemen offered a promising field for development under joint Anglo-Egyptian auspices. The idea was discouraged, and it was pointed out that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would not be a party to the encouragement of the Yemen in an anti-Ibn Saud sense. International Conventions. 68. The following international conventions have been ratified by Egypt during the year under review :— {a) International Convention on Mutual Defence against Dengue Fever, signed at Athens on the 25th July, 1934 (by decree dated the 14th November, 1935). (b) International Sanitary Convention, signed at Paris, the 21st June, 1926 (by Decree-Law No. 107 of the 19th September, 1935). (c) International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation, signed at The Hague on the 12th April, 1933 (by decree dated the 9th May, which became effective on the 1st August). (d) Convention relative to the Preservation of Faura and Flora, signed in London on the 8th November, 1933 (instrument of ratification deposited in London on the 21st February, 1935). Egyptian Propaganda A broad. 69. The business of propaganda has been transferred from the Ministry of Finance to the new Ministry of Commerce, which was given credits in the 1935 budget of—- £E. 5,000 for propaganda for Egyptian products; and £E. 2,000 for preparatory work for the 1936 Industrial Exhibition (tor which the Ministry of Agriculture also had £E. 7,500). £E. 500 retained in the finance budget for similar purposes has not been used.71 The Tourist Development Association was given the usual grant of £E. 10,000. 72. There was a special number of the Manchester Guardian in January, costing about £E. 1,500. Chapter III.— Kelations between Egypt and the Sudan. General. 73. The High Commissioner paid his first official visit to the Sudan from the 12th February to the 20th February. After a stay of five days at Khartum, he visited the Gezira and the Eastern Sudan. At Wad Medani he met members of the Blue Nile Province Staff and of the Sudan Plantations Syndicate. The tour also included visits to Kassala, Port Sudan and Atbara. 74. Relations between Egypt and the Sudan continued to be satisfactory. The outstanding event of the year was the visit of the Egyptian trade mission to the Sudan organised by the Royal Agricultural Society of Egypt and the Chamber of Commerce in Khartum, to which reference was made in last year’s report. The delegation, which consisted of thirty-one representative persons drawn from Egyptian agricultural, commercial and financial circles, was headed by Rashwan Pasha Mahfouz, formerly Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, with Fuad Bey Abaza, the Director of the Royal Agricultural Society of Egypt, as secretary and deputy leader. The party arrived at Port Sudan and visited Tokar, the Gash delta, Kassala, Sennar and El Obeid, returning thence to Khartum with a visit of two days to the Gezira cotton scheme and the Sudan Plantations Syndicate’s headquarters and ginneries. Their programme at Khartum included a series of exhaustive discussions with the Sudan Chamber of Commerce, interviews with the Governor-General and heads of relevant Sudan Government Departments, a tea-party at the Palace and a visit to Gebel Aulia dam. The principal headings under which agreement was reached were as follows :— \ a ) wa s agreed tnat tne Egyptian delegation and the Sudan Chamber of Commerce should approach their respective Governments with the request that in all cases where tenders were called for by Government specifying that the article should be of local origin no distinction should be made between Egyptian and Sudanese produce. (b) Ihe delegation agreed to ask the Egyptian Government to protect Sudan produce from competition by the produce of other countries when necessary. In view of the customs agreement between Egypt and the Sudan, it is unlikely that their resolution will affect the present position. ^ (c) Both parties agreed that a permanent committee should be appointed with the object of fostering trade between the two countries, to meet annually alternately m Cairo and Khartum. 6 Camber to approach the Government with a view to / \ t.

As regards the other points referred to above, although nothing very ibstantial can be said to have been achieved, it is not unreasonable to hope that some increase of Sudan-Egyptian trade will follow. . .Although the mission was strictly non-political, it was inevitable that their visit should give rise to some speculation as to its real object. The delegation behaved with studied propriety, though individual speakers allowed themselves occasionally to be carried away by sentiment evolved by the cordiality of the welcome accorded to them. All, however, were deeply appreciative of the reception given to them by the Sudan Government and were obviously impressed by the efficiency of the administration. The reactions in the Sudan were remarkably slight, but some of the younger efiendiya at Khartum betrayed a certain amount of excitement, and El Sayed Sir Abdel Rahman-el-Mahdi took the occasion to acquire considerable publicity in Egyptian circles. The older folk, however, tended to be reserved and in some cases rather suspicious as to the visit. The Egyptian press, as was to be expected, followed the tour with great interest and seized upon the enthusiastic reception which it was reported to have received to discuss the Sudan problem in its more general aspects. Trade between Egypt and the Sudan. 78. Trade between the two countries remained satisfactory, imports from Egypt to the Sudan in the first ten months of 1935 being valued at £E. 829,568 as compared with £E. 701,315 in 1934, while imports from the Sudan to Egypt during the same period were valued at £E. 468,376 instead of £E. 662,859 in the previous year. The decrease in the latter was due to the decline in the imports of dura from the Sudan, which in 1934 had risen to a fantastic and wholly exceptional figure owing to a scarcity of dura in Egypt. 79. The Banque Misr directors, Talaat Pasha Harb, Midhat Pasha Yeghen and Dr. Fuad Bey Sultan, who for over a year had been thinking of paying a visit to the Sudan with the object of examining the possibilities for a branch of the bank in Khartum, carried out their project in November. They visited Khartum and a number of economic centres, and their attitude was throughout all that could be desired. The impression they left upon the Sudan Chamber of Commerce was that they would probably open a branch of the Banque Misr in Khartum, but subsequently Talaat Harb Pasha s chronic suspicion of the British seems to have got the better of him, and it remains to be seen whether anything will eventuate. Chapter IV.— Economic and Financial Situation. than £li million been opened ?n the course of the year. Their effect was that the usual economy in expenditure was not realised. 81. The reserve fund was brought, as a result of the year, to the figure of £E. 32,621,929. . . Budgeting in foreknowledge of such results, the Government raised its -DUL g fc, ni-r OT? QO QTA 000 /mnrp than £E. 1 milllOIl [13399]part compensation for which the duty on sugar was raised £E. 1 a ton and FT. 5 a kilogramme added to the customs duty on tobacco. 83. The year’s revenue is turning out even better than anticipated : at the end of the first half of the year receipts exceeded those of the previous year by more than £E. 1,200,000, principally produced at the custom-house. 84. At the end of July an important reduction was introduced in the scam of tax on motor cars, the duty on benzine being raised in compensation. The only other changes of taxation, in.the current year, apart from minor adjustments of the tariff, have been, firstly, a short-lived double duty on Roumanian imports, to reinforce the Government in negotiating a clearing agreement with that country which was initialled at the end of November (the object of the negotia tions had been to secure payment from Roumania of frozen commercial credits and to get a better quota for Egyptian imports there), and, secondly, a surtax of 40 per cent, ad valorem, on certain Japanese imports, justified by the fall in the exchange value of the yen, which was also imposed as a step in negotiating a trade agreement to protect the nascent textile industry of Egypt from Japanese competition. The negotiations still continue. 85. The revision of the land tax, which will take effect in 1942, has been begun, and is proceeding satisfactorily. 86. During the year two important steps have been taken to give additional relief to rural debtors. The mortgages of the Mortgage Company of Egypt were taken over by the semi-Governmental Credit agricole hypothecaire, which was enabled by a Government guarantee to issue bonds at 3J per cent. : the amount thus paid to the mortgage company was £E. 1,807,254. Simultaneously, the Credit foncier was induced to grant a series of facilities to its creditors which were expected to reduce the average rate of interest on some 14^ million of mortgage debt from 6-4 per cent, to 5 per cent, at a cost to the shareholders of about £E. 180,000 a year. The company was enabled to grant these facilities by knowing that a decree was about to be issued protecting them from the gold claims of their bondholders. The decree appeared on the 2nd May, and extended the Cours force of Egyptian bank-notes to international payments.

It was furthef suggested that the decree xing a temporary settlement if it turned out possible to arrange one was to be accompanied by a proces-verbal embodying a reservation by the Egyptian Govern- ment to be attached to the decree, to the effect that they adhered to their view that the service of the debt should at all times be on a sterling basis, though wi ling m a spirit of conciliation to agree to a sterling arrangement for three yeais only and His Majesty s Government and the Italian Government were then m the same document to declare their agreement with the Egyptian Government. 92. The Egyptian Government replied in two memoranda of the 13th January, emphasising the advantages of a permanent over a temporary settle ment, with detailed arguments showing the evil effects of the latter on Egyptian economy and finances, and indicating that they agreed with the Residency’s suggestions for dealing with the possibility of a gold judgment. They expressed the hope that before asking Egypt to accept a temporary settlement His Majesty’s Government would make a further effort to persuade the French to agree to a permanent settlement, and indicated that if this attempt failed, Egypt would accept the proposed temporary settlement subject to certain formal alterations to the proces-verbal proposed by the Residency. The Egyptian Government had only been brought to this point after considerable opposition especially on the part of the Finance Minister, who at one time threatened to resign. 93. On the 14th February His Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris was instructed to take the matter up personally with M. Laval and do his utmost to secure French acquiescence in a permanent settlement, excluding from his discussions the possibility of a temporary settlement. M. Laval did in fact give orders that the matter should be reconsidered with a view to giving His Majesty’s Government complete satisfaction if possible, but on the 26th March Sir George Clerk reported that the French Government had delivered a final reply rejecting a permanent settlement on a sterling basis and expressing their readiness to accept a temporary settlement in the form of suspension of judicial proceedings against the Egyptian Government for three years, the rights of the parties being reserved during this period. (This was similar to a proposal of His Majesty’s Government made in June 1934 and did not conform to the lines on which Egyptian Government were reluctantly prepared to acquiesce in three years’ postponement, see paragraph 92 above.) His Majesty’s Government now proposed to the Egyptian Government to substitute for the proces-verbal referred to in paragraph 91 a unilateral communique by the Egyptian Government containing the same reservation and adding that they had learned with satis faction that His Majesty’s Government agreed with their view. 94 The Egyptian Government maintained their insistence on the proces-verbal as proposed by the Residency in December and amended by them selves in January. At a meeting of British, French and Italian expeits held in Paris on the 11th and 12th April, the French delegates strongly opposed the Anglo-Italian declaration in the said’ proe'es-verbal and also refused to accept temporary settlement if the private debts legislation (see paragraph 98 below) w“e prSeeded with as drafted. The Egyptian Government refused to give wav on either point and the meeting ended in failure. In reality the principal cauh of the breakdown had been the insistence of the French on linking the public , i , . i 11 p Wislation cancelling gold clauses in private debts, which His Ma esT’s Government “nsTde^ed shofld be treated as entirely distinct matters KtTer behS f “internal matter to be dealt with by the Egyptian Government on heir own responsibility.

It was therefore proposed by the Residency to the Foreign Office that in the event of a gold judgment and a refusal by the commissioners to continue to pay in sterling the Egyptian Government should issue a decree suspending the commissioners. Their functions would have to be transferred either to the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Adviser, or the British Commissioner alone. The discussion was concerned with the terms of the letter which it was proposed that the Egyptian Government should immediately on a gold judgment address to the Debt Commissioners; and further with the question of the exact stage at which the issue of the decree suspending the commissioners should be issued. A number of difficult points both of law and policy were involved, the political question as usual entailing the balancing of French and Egyptian susceptibilities. Finally an aide-memoire dated the 31st December was given to the Prime Minister together with draft texts of the documents which it was proposed should be issued in the event of a gold judgment. These texts comprised (a) a letter from the Egyptian Government to the Debt Commissioners (to be sent whether the latter wrote to the Egyptian Government first themselves or not) requesting an assurance that the service of the debts would be made only in sterling; (b) a public communique announcing the decision of the Egyptian Government to pay only in sterling; (c) a decree suspending all three Debt Commissioners, and appointing Sir R. Greg as sole administrator; (d) a letter inviting Sir R. Greg to assume the administration alone. 96. It was proposed in the aide-memoire that the decree suspending the commissioners (see preceding paragraph (c)) should be held in reserve until such time as the High Commissioner learned from Sir R. Greg that he was no longer able to satisfy himself that the commissioners were respecting the Egyptian Government’s decision. Thus even though the commissioners failed to give a formal undertaking, actual suspension would be delayed until they had shown by their action that it was unavoidable. Owing to the Bairam holiday these documents were not actually communicated to the Prime Minister until after the New Year had begun and it may be added that they were accepted in toto by the then Egyptian Government. 97. Throughout the year the attitude of the Italian Government had been tantamount to one of benevolent neutrality, that Government avoiding initiative, but endeavouring always to facilitate Anglo-French negotiations by raising no objections of their own to any proposals which His Majesty’s Government miormed them they were making to the French Government. rmvate Debts. fnr l 8 ' 11 h , as t been seen (paragraph 94) that the negotiations with the French were comXhlTr ra A Sett e T n n of u th ? pubhc debt b 7 legislation plicated by, and eventually broke down over, the existence of the fnttLaTn—tS 1 ^ f? ^ - private con ” Lolvm| “ywhlch LTTadleS TS IuT certain cases brought by bondholders against the Credit fond^tnd‘the L PubIkDfbTcase. 41 ” 11112 Payment “ g ° ld Were P endin S concurrently with23 % [13399] nnifnlUH 1 w ab ° Ve C as ? of contracts .

His Majesty’s Government did not commit them selves at the time as to whether they would agree, if one or more Powers refused their assent, to the Egyptian Government refusing to allow gold judgments to be executed. There was considerable discussion as to whether the decree should not contain a provision specifically exempting the Suez Canal Company, but this proposal was finally dropped on the ground (essentially) that the Suez Canal documents contained no gold clause, so that the decree would have no direct application to them. 100. The Egyptian Government in due course gave an assurance, as requested by His Majesty’s Government, that, if the Mixed Courts refused to apply the proposed legislation in the sense desired, they would at once seek the assent of the Powers. The issue of the decree was, however, suspended at the request of His Majesty’s Government in order to give every chance of success to the Anglo-French negotiations about the public debt. 101. The Egyptian Government, meanwhile, had acquired an additional reason for putting this legislation into effect as a result of an arrangement between the Minister of Finance and the Credit foncier, whereby the latter undertook to make important concessions to its agricultural debtors on the understanding that it would be relieved of its own gold obligations to its foreign creditors. 102. At the Paris meeting in April (see paragraph 94 above) the French experts based their resistance to the Anglo-Egyptian formula for the proposed compromise on the public debt less on the formula itself than on the existence of the draft private debts decree. They challenged the right of the Egyptian Government to enact the decree without the assent of the Powers and were only prepared to agree that actions on private gold obligations should be only temporarily suspended for three years in the same way as was proposed for the public debt. They refused to admit the contention of His Majesty’s Government that the two questions were distinct, the private debts being a matter for the Egyptian Government to deal with independently. 103. The breakdown of the negotiations for a temporary settlement of the public debt led His MAjesty’s Government to withdraw their pressure on the Egyptian Government to hold up the private debts decree, which was duly issued on the 2nd May. On the 14th July the French Minister gave the Prime Minister a note protesting against the application of the decree to French subjects as a violation of capitulatory rights, and demanding their exemption from its scope. (This specific demand was, in the strict sense of the word, impertinent, as it is for the Mixed Courts to decide whether the legislation is applicable to foreigners —while there could be no question of exemption of the nationals of one particular Power) The French note as a whole indicated the difficulties likely to be encountered if the Mixed Courts should decide against the applicability of the decree, difficulties which might in the last resort lead to France withdrawing from the Mixed Courts Convention. 104 The Egyptian Government replied protesting against the 4 rench Government’s intervention against the decree when its applicability to foreigners was still sub judice (but the terms of the answer did not imply that the Egyptian Government 4ould accept an adverse judgment of the Mixed Court of Appeal)^ The Prime Minister had agreed, at the request of the financial adviser, to omit ; sentence in the reply as originally drafted offering to submit the question to the Permanent Court of International Justice. His Majesty s Government the Eermane Egyptian reply, subject also to the exclusion of 'ten e n question UnKiately, Bedaw,''Pasha, the Egyptian lega the sente c 4 ible f or tb i s 0 ff er; proceeded to make it orally to the counsellor . . P d the Frenc h Minister informed the Prime Minister French Debt Commissio , r ” The Prime Minister subsequently s&amp;aws jaas'fiw e™,, ^ — made, and could not entertain, any such proposal.105 While no further action took place before the end of lhe year m relation to the private debts, it may be useful to summarise the result of discussions between the Residency and the Foreign Office on certain questions of future procedure :— (d) The Foreign Office agreed that no reference should be made at present to possible eventual reference to the Permanent Court of Internationa. Justice, but had not decided whether, if eventually the Egyptian Government wished to do so, they should be prevented. Cb) It was decided to ask the Egyptian Government, in the event of the Mixed Courts refusing to apply the private debts decree, to seek the assent of the Mixed Courts Legislative Assembly before seeking that of the Powers (to which, as has been said, they had already agreed). The reason for this was that, since at least one Power was likely to refuse, there seemed to be a better chance with the Legislative Assembly, where a two-thirds majority would suffice. This proposal was not, however, actually made to the Egyptian Government during the year under review. Economic Recovery. 106. Egypt’s continued recovery from the bottom of the depression which was reached in May 1933 is reflected in almost all the statistics available. Exports in the cotton year (September 1934-August 1935) were £E. 32,197,000 against £E. 31,057,000 in the previous year, and imports were £E. 30,741,000 against £E. 28,023,000. 107. The reduction in the favourable balance of visible trade from £E. 3,034,000 to £E. 1,456,000 was not due to the smaller 1934 cotton crop, as fortunately the improvement in price offset the reduction in quantity, and the money yield of the 1934 crop, roughly calculated on average fully good fair prices, was slightly higher than that of its predecessor. 108. In the winter crops harvested last May there was a drop in price, offset by a phenomenal yield :— Wheat Beans Barley Area sown Yield in ardebs per feddan.

The cotton crop of 1935 is estimated at 8 J million kantars, to exceed last year’s crop by f million kantars, and is being sold at better prices; this is laying the foundation of enhanced prosperity in the coming months and has already quickened the tempo of importation. 110 . The increased purchasing power of the country is indicated by a 23 per cent, increase m the imports of motor cars and 230 per cent, increase in net import of lorries (the Abyssinian war created a brisk demand for their sTgnffica'nt!- 7 ^ ^ ^ consum Ption of sugar is also First nine months-- Tons {935 94,912 year in theYmoun^speJTnXmc^TerSlLTra l^hal “’P T r the p r evious increase of 7 per cent. fertilisers, 1935 has so far shown a further good cotton fand i^the dffita now lete a^fiFT^fEia 0611 k’h the laSt year; least 50 per cent, better than the rents current three years’ala 18 ' at 113.

The United Kingdom export trade to Egypt shows a steady decline in proportional share of the total. The decrease Ifthe percentage of import obtained from the United Kingdom indicates that the advantage fronTthe increased purchasing power into Egypt during the last two years has accrued m large measure to such competitors as Japan and Germany. tt V P rmc ipal event of 1935 in the economic relations between the United Kingdom and Egypt was undoubtedly the visit of a mission of economic enquiry, under the chairmanship of Dr. Hafez Afifi Pasha, to England. From the United Kingdom’s point of view, the object of the mission was two-fold. The declared object was to give C£ opportunities for close study of the commercial relations between the two countries and for an examination of ways and means of placing those commercial relations on an even more satisfactory basis.” Behind this, however, lay the political importance of emphasising and developing the economic ties between the United Kingdom and Egypt. The mission declined to be convinced by the United Kingdom arguments in favour of a quota for cotton piece-goods (the most important hem in the United Kingdom desiderata), and, indeed, although the report of the mission is an interesting contribution to the literature of Anglo-Egyptian economic relations, it is not possible yet to regard it as having made any substantial contribution towards the problem of the maintenance of the United Kingdom export trade at its former level. On the advice of the mission the commercial treaty between Egypt and Japan was denounced as a preliminary to negotiations for a new treaty which would have the result of applying a brake to the problem of Japanese competition in cotton piece-goods. This action, however, was taken rather in the interests of the Egyptian cotton industry than in that of the United Kingdom, although faint hopes may be harboured that, if Japanese competition is substantially reduced, the United Kingdom may eventually derive some benefit. 118. Important contracts were secured by the United Kingdom during the year for fifty locomotives and 304 trucks, and for 600,000 tons of coal. So far as coal is concerned, apart from the important purchases of the State Railways, it is becoming increasingly difficult for British coal to withstand the determined competition of Germany and Poland. 119. During the year negotiations were continued between the Shell Company and the Egyptian Government regarding the exploration leases of Anglo-Egvptian Oilfields (Limited). After a long period of deadlock on the question &amp; of an equitable level of royalty payment, an agreement was eventually reached which, however, at the end of the year still recjuired the approval of the Council of Ministers. Foreign Trade. 120 The latest available statistics of foreign trade indicate that an increase took place in 1935, by comparison with 1934, in both exports and imports The latter, however, increased at a higher rate than the former, with the result that on the 30th September, 1935, imports exceeded exports by £E 147,785 as compared with an export excess of £E. 289,164 on the corresponding dateof 1934. The total for import and export trade m the first nine months of 1935 was 1 e 44 425 , 979 , Tcompared with £E. 41,429166 for 1934.. At the end of Sent ember the visible foreign trade was roughly in equilibrium, a favourable trade balance of £E. 3i million which stood to the country’s credit at the end of26 raw cotton, rice and eggs. by India, Spam and UzecnosiovaKia.

Coal imports increased by £E. 84,000, the United Kingdom’s share showing an advance of £E. 41,000 on 1934. 124. In every category of pure cotton piece-goods the United Kingdom registered a further decline, in contrast to the continued advance of Japan. Cotton. 125. The total quantity of raw cotton exported during the cotton year ending the 31st August, 1935, amounted to 1,060,000 bales (7,855,060 kantars), as compared with 1,208,000 bales (8,912,823 kantars) in the season September 1933-August 1934. On the whole, prices during the season were satisfactory, gradually rising all the time from the very low ebb they had reached in 1932-33. 126. The estimate by the Ministry of Agriculture for the new crop (of which a large proportion has already been exported) is placed at 8,255,000 kantars, as compared with 8,216,701 kantars in 1934. This, incidentally, seems to be considered a high estimate. Considerably less Sakelaridis will, it is expected, be available, owing to the fact that in 1934 Lower Egypt, where this variety of cotton is principally grown, suffered severely from attacks of cotton worm, with the result that large tracts were withdrawn from cotton cultivation this year. Another feature of the estimate is the decline in the average yield per feddan of the varieties grown in Upper Egypt, which was ravaged by the cotton worm in the exceptional summer of 1935. 127. There has been a brisk demand for the new season’s crop from every where, but mainly from the United Kingdom and the continent. Demand has been stimulated by fear that the political situation will interfere with shipping and fear also of rising war risk insurance rates. The Assouan Dam Power and Fertiliser Scheme. p no? °® ers ma de to the Egyptian Government by two groups at the end cp 934 stimulated once more a certain interest in the consideration of the long standing idea for the erection of a fertiliser fa.ctrvrv dpnpnHnnf rm r»nwor» wUir*n27 Ministers that negotiations should be undertaken regarding the execution of 111 the ^st Place with an English group composed of X English ectric Company and Imperial Chemical Industries. Should these negotiations tuil, the committee recommended that the offer submitted by the British Nitrogen Engineering Company should next be considered and, failing success in the Negotiations with that group, they recommended the offer of the I.G. Farben- 1 Er Strie i i consec l u ence of these recommendations, the Finance Minister addressed a letter on the 5th June to the English Electric Company, informing that firm that the Egyptian Government would examine their proposals in the first place and, whilst so engaged, would not entertain any other proposals. In the last days of November, however, Sir Felix Pole arrived in Cairo on behalf, not of Metropolitan-Vickers’ electrical interests, but of the British Nitrogen Engineering Corporation, with which firm is associated the British Thomson- Houston Company, and endeavoured to secure the abandonment by the Egyptian Government of its undertaking towards the English Electric Company and Imperial Chemical Industries. In the event the matter was referred to the Department, which deprecated any breach by the Egyptian Government of its promise to the English Electric Company. 129. The attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards this scheme has been throughout scrupulously neutral. Not only have they consistently refused to intervene on behalf of any one competitor, but they have refrained ab initio from expressing to the Egyptian Government any opinion on the advisability or otherwise of the latter’s embarking upon a policy of artificial fertiliser production on a large scale inasmuch as such a development would inevitably as surely injure one group of United Kingdom interests (those of British capital invested in Chilean nitrates, in British shipping transporting them, and in United Kingdom factories producing artificial fertiliser) as it would benefit another United Kingdom group (manufacturers of electrical and other machinery required for the project). The present position is that negotiations are proceeding in accordance with Abdul Wahab Pasha’s undertaking with the English Electric and Imperial Chemical Industries group. Ministry of Commerce. 130. Although the decree establishing the Ministry of Commerce was published on the 24th December, 1934, it was not until May that the new Ministry began to take definite shape, and not until June that the first Minister, Naguib-el-Hilaly Bey, was appointed. A British adviser, Sir Geoffrey Corbett, was appointed in May, and has made various suggestions for the scope of the work of the new Ministry. Abdul Wahab Pasha, who has been credited with harbouring unsatisfied ambitions to become the first Minister of Commerce, declined to give up such sections of the Ministry of Finance as might reasonably have been expected to fall to the Ministry of Commerce. 131. A recommendation has been made and approved by the Council of Ministers that the Egyptian State Railways shall be transferred from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Commerce. 132. Apart from reorganisation preoccupations, the main activity of the Ministry since its inception has been in connexion with the commercial negotiations with Palestine, Japan and Roumania. Transport. 133. Competition between road and rail transport has been exercising the minds of the Egyptian Government during 1935. A suggestion had been made by the General Manager of the Egyptian State Railways that the country should be divided into zones, and transport rights distributed to companies m which the railways should hold a controlling interest. This project was approved, and is being tried as an experiment, in the province of Menouha. 134 Early in 1935 Sir Felix Pole visited Egypt at the request of the Egyptian Government to investigate certain questions relating to the railways^ Tn^his report he recommended a comprehensive policy of co-ordination of transport ^Nothing has yet been done to give effect to this suggestion but it seems kely that it ZsJwait on the plans of Sir Geoffrey Corbett for the development of communications under the Ministry of Commerce.Economic draft lawg relating to trade-marks and copyright have not yet passed into effect, although efforts have been and are being made to accelerate their progress. 136 The latest draft of the important law dealing with insurance was drawn up in the early part of the year; the clauses relating to deposits and invest- ment of capital in Egypt continued to rouse much opposition from Bn companies operating in Egypt, and strong representations were made on this subject to the Egyptian Government. 137 A law dealing with billposting is also under consideration, as well as another one which has for its object the control by the Minister of Agriculture of the cultivation of varieties of cotton other than those specified m the law. A reference is made elsewhere to the revision of the scales oi taxation on motor cars and the increase of the excise duty on benzine. Tourist Traffic. 138. The season 1934-35 was regarded as the most satisfactory since 1929-30. An estimate of the value of this important invisible export places it in an inferior position only to the visible exports of raw cotton and cotton seed. Reviewing the position at the end of April 1935, the managing director of Egyptian Hotels (Limited) gave it as his opinion that, in spite of the effects of the crisis and of the restrictions imposed by certain European countries on the export of currency, the travelling public has increased in number. 139. The subject of the encouragement of tourist traffic received the close attention of the Egyptian Government in the early summer, with the result that a new section was created (as part of the Ministry of Commerce), to^ focus official activities dealing with the subject of encouragement for tourist traffic. 140. Unfortunately, however, owing to war rumours and internal disturbances towards the end of the year, there was every indication that the season 1935-36 would prove an extremely poor one. The loss to Egypt is set off to some extent (to how much is not readily calculable) by the increased expendi ture of British troops in Egypt. The situation, nevertheless, so far as the hotels and other organisations concerned with the tourist industry are involved, cannot be regarded as other than serious. Banque Misr. 141 On the 7th May the Banque Misr celebrated the 15th anniversary of its foundation with a monster tea-party given in the Ezbekieh Gardens, at which the High Commissioner and all senior members of his staff attended. 142 Any attempt to summarise the work of fifteen years would be out of place here : suffice it is to say that for good or ill, the bank’s activities are inextric ably bound up with Egyptian industrialisation. There have been, it is true, criticisms of its activities, but it may be said that anything which touches the Banque Misr and its associated companies touches the amour-propre of the Egyptian nation, and it may be regarded in all but name a Government institution. The occasion to which reference is made above was marked by the usual outcrop of complacent orations, notable amongst which was the lengthy speech by Mohamed Talaat Harb Pasha, the G.O.M. of the nascent industrial era of Egypt. The statistical foundation for Talaat Harb’s enthusiasm is as follows : Year. Capital. Net Profit. Reserves. Dividends paid ( 1 ).

Chapter V,— General, sanctions to of P a f ici P ati( &gt; n by Egypt in the application of economic sanctions to Italy m case the League of Nations should invite non-member States K Ctl ° n 7 aS raised ^ ]n a telegram from the Secretary of State on the iL tor fL tei r ber, an( ? 0n 1 17th Octob er the High Commissioner was informed tofrT fshoil] 1 d . 1 lssu e such an invitation His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, while avoiding any pressure on the Egyptian Government HaKXXX ^ S u bl L llty h, 01, PJ°} ectill g E gyP fc against the consequences of aly s annoyance. It had been decided that provided the measures which might be taken involved no violation of the system of Capitulations (i.e., the judicial system of the Mixed Courts and extra-territorial jurisdiction) or of any treaty r VU° ^ r than Italian, the violation of Italy’s most-favoured-nation rights embodied in the Exchange of Notes of 1930 with Egypt need not be taken too seriously by the Egyptian Government. The latter should not, however, attempt to justify the violation of this agreement on strictly legal grounds, but on high moral and political arguments. It was at this stage still considered probable that Egyptian action would have to be limited to Italian imports into Egypt. The High Commissioner was also instructed to suggest to the Prime Minister that, in the event of Egypt being invited to collaborate in the discussions of a co-ordinating committee, his Excellency might prefer that His Majesty’s Government should act as a buffer between him and the League. 144. The High Commissioner was authorised to sound the Prime Minister informally in the sense of the preceding paragraph (limiting the discussion to the question of imports only), and he accordingly gave Tewfik Nessim Pasha, on the 18th October, an aide-memoire (which did not, however, refer to the question of the Geneva Co-ordinating Committee—see paragraph 151 below). 145. The Prime Minister received on the 29th October the expected invitation from the League of Nations, and on the 30th October after discussion with Sir Miles Lampson, followed by the consent of the Council of Ministers, despatched a reply stating that Egypt would adhere in principle to the measures taken by way of sanctions in connexion with the conflict between Italy and Ethiopia, and that their application would be effected within the limits of what was possible. On the same day the Council of Ministers agreed to the setting up of a Ministerial Committee composed of the Ministers of Finance, Justice, Commerce, and of the Judicial Adviser, Sir Arthur Booth. (This carried out a suggestion the High Commissioner had made to the Prime Minister.) 146. The Ministerial Committee held three meetings and its conclusions may be summarised as follows. Egypt could prohibit both imports from and exports to Italy without infringement of capitulatory rights, and the risk of unfavourable judgments should be taken. Existing contracts should be left unaffected. The prohibition of imports would be a direct breach of the most favoured-nation agreement (see paragraph 143 above), but such breach could not be prayed in aid by individuals to found actions in damages, and it should be made on political and moral grounds. Although the scheduled list of exports to Italy to be prohibited actually affected only animals and manganese, the whole list put forward by the League Committee should be prohibited. Financial sanctions should not be applied in view of the large Italian banking and financial interests in Egypt, and the consequent impossibility of control without violation of capitulatory rights. It was recommended that legislation should take the form of decree-laws, and that the Kellogg Pact should be invoked as well as the League s invitation to participate in sanctions. 147 On the 29th October the Italian Ambassador in London had enquired whether it was true that His Majesty’s Government were asking the Egyptian Government to join in the application of sanctions, and that theji were con- temolating suspension of the Capitulations. He was informed that there was aoThing m ^rumour.” On the 7th November the Italian Minister m Cairo handed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs a note verbale, which contained a formal protest against the decision of the Egyptian Government to adhere m orinciple to the policy of sanctions, and reserved the right to adopt the measures vhich might be rendered necessary by any violation of international agreementsby Egypt in consequence of the application of tlie^said^decMon.^ia^ ( , |iV( ,° r|1 . nent went on to see the Prime Minister ^ ^ ^ ^ to discuss details wi'th'the Ministerial ^MmtSns’ Committee.

He argued that a non-member State having adhered to the principle of sanctions had as much right as a member State to regard simh oFits international obligations as would stand m the way of sanctions asLcondary to the obligations which it would assume by adhei ing, and eyentua y rpTdgrlph was inserted in the note which accompanied the decree imposing lanctiSsee paragraph 149 below) to the effect that any obligations arising from particular conventions with Italy would be suspended so long as sanctions were applied if they were inconsistent with the application thereot. 148 Bedawi Pasha endeavoured to have a protest made to the French Government in respect to a decree by the latter which submitted French subjects, in countries where France exercised ex-territorial jurisdiction, to French sanctions legislation. His object was to challenge the alleged implicit assumption or the French that French subjects could not be bound by Egyptian sanctions legislation without such a decree. Naturally, this trouble-making suggestion received no encouragement from the Judicial Adviser, and it appears to have been abandoned. 149. Meanwhile, drafts on the basis of the recommendations of the Ministerial Committee were duly prepared. The Council of Ministers decided to publish as an explanatory note to the decree imposing sanctions a lengthy note which the Prime Minister had submitted (on the 27th November) to the Council of Ministers. It was found to contain at the end a paragraph (which to the practised eye suggested the hand of Bedawi Pasha) which observed that “ the capitulatory rbgime could in no way and by no title limit the liberty of the Egyptian Government in their adhesion or application (of sanctions), nor offer any obstacle to the inevitable consequences of such application.” This could only mean not that the particular sanctions proposed would not violate capitulatory rights, but that it did not matter whether sanctions violated capitulatory rights or not. Fortunately, the Judicial Adviser, after discussion with the High Commissioner, persuaded the Prime Minister to excise this paragraph, and the decree imposing sanctions—on certain classes of imports and exports—was signed by King Fuad on the 28th November and published in satisfactory form on the 2nd December. 150. As mentioned at the end of paragraph 143 above, His Majesty’s Government had foreseen the possibility that Egypt might be invited to participate in the deliberations of the Co-ordinating Committee at Geneva. Actually, this suggestion came first from the Egyptian side, the Prime Minister informing the High Commissioner casually on the 11th November that Bedawi Pasha had advised him to ask for representation on the committee. On receipt of instructions from the Secretary of State, Sir Miles Lampson explained to lewfik Nessim and at his request confirmed the suggestion in a private letter of the 3rd December that Flis Majesty’s Government would be glad to use their good offices to secure the association of Egypt with the work of the committee by some convenient means. The most convenient procedure would be an application 7 f Egyptian Government to the Secretary-General stating in general terms that, having adopted the League’s recommendations, they desired to be associated with the work of the Co-ordinating Committee in whatever form would be most convement for the purposes of the committee. The Prime Minister acknowledged nrltelf h tL 0I T 18 /* 10n f i etter , wlth - thanks on the 5th December, but did not Lth January 1936 ° 6 a PP lcatl0n 'I was proposed to make until the31 fo3 proof of great food w!l/L^ °bserved that the Egyptian Government gave press actfvefv TJZH ^ h f ndlm g of th e whole question of sanctions.

Had they felt inclined to do so, the fertile wit of Uedawi Easha would certainly have contrived ingenious methods of exploitation. Defence of Egypt. 152. General. The first indication of anxiety in Egypt as to the possible eltects on this country of an outbreak of hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia w a s given by King Fuad, who drew the attention of the Prime Minister in June to the danger of an air attack on the barrages of Upper and Lower Egypt. The Prime Minister asked for British assistance to prevent any such eventuality, and the High Commissioner accordingly requested the General Officer Commanding and the Air Officer Commanding to study the question. The views of the latter authorities, which were communicated to the Prime Minister, were, generally, that owing to the distance from potential enemy aerodromes, the strength of the structures and the narrowness of the target, the possibility of effective damage being done to the barrages was remote. The most vulnerable was the Delta Barrage, a comparatively frail structure a few miles below Cairo which controls the water supply of the whole of Lower Egypt. (It should be noted that subsequent reinforcements to the air strength of Libya brought most if not all the barrages well within striking distance of Italian aircraft.) As a preliminary precautionary measure, the General Officer Commanding advocated (1) the revision of the intelligence system of the Western Desert under a British officer (this was duly carried out), and (2) the preparation of a scheme for a chain of observers and wireless stations in that area (this was carried out and put into effect later in the year). 153. At the beginning of July the Prime Minister again expressed anxiety as to Egypt’s position in the event of hostilities; and expressed the hope that he was right in assuming that in the event of trouble Egypt could look to Great Britain for protection. Speaking without instructions, the High Commissioner said that his assumption was that in the event of external attack His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would certainly come to the defence of Egypt. This view was fully confirmed in a telegram from the Foreign Office, which stressed Great Britain’s position in Egypt under the reserved points. 154. On the 30th August the Acting High Commissioner was informed of the first precautionary measures which His Majesty’s Government had decided to take in view of possible developments arising out of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. They consisted of (1) the despatch to the Eastern Mediterranean of the Mediterranean Fleet, and (2) the despatch of Royal Air Force reinforcements to Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East Command. On the 2nd September the Mediterranean Fleet, under the command of Sir W. W. Fisher, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., K.C.B., arrived at Alexandria, to be joined in the course of the next few' weeks by naval units from the Home Fleet and other parts of the world. About the middle of September the first British troops were sent to Mersa Matruh, where they began to establish defences in co-operation with troops of the Egyptian army. Subsequently, British troops were sent to Sidi Barrani, Solium and Siwa. Units of the Royal Air Force and the Egyptian Army Air Force were stationed at Mersa Matruh, and the old military aerodrome of Amiriya west of Alexandria, was taken over by the Royal Air Force with the permission of King Fuad, whose property it is. Motor machine-gun sections of the Egyptian army and six light patrol-car sections of the frontiers Administration were employed on duty in the Western Desert. Anti-aircraft and coastal defences were erected at Alexandria. The first body of British militaryreinforcements arrived in November, and further units left England at the end of December. 155 From the beginning the most careful steps were taken to secure Egyptian collaboration and goodwill in such measures ^ 11 ,^ as .“■^ SSa f 1 ^ i ° t to meet the emergency, and thus, it was hoped avoid Lhe ,! e P e ‘ lt r 1 t 0 “ °[ made in the Great War which had led to ill-feeling on the part ot mdividua. Egyptians and the gradual alienation of Egyptian sentiments of loyalty to and sympathy for Great Britain. At the beginning of October the High Commissioner was authorised to collaborate with the Egyptian authorities m matters of mi y importance, and this collaboration was subsequently extended to include such questions as measures for dealing with the Italian colony, censorship, the establishment of martial law, &amp;c. On the return oi the Residency to Cairo m the middle of October, a co-ordinating committee was established under the chairmanship of the Brigadier, General Staff, and consisting of representatives of the Residency, the Royal Air Force, the navy, the Egyptian army, the Frontiers Administration, the Financial Adviser s Department, the Judicial Adviser s Department, the European Department and the Sudan agent, to co-ordinate and advise on all questions arising out of the existing emergency except those of a purely military character. As the result of the recommendations of this committee, steps were taken to co-ordinate, through a central office under Colonel Cunningham, R.A.S.C., the purchases of supplies, stores, provisions, &amp;c., by the three services and the Egyptian army, and to prevent overlapping. An Egyptian Government Ministerial Committee, with a sub-committee comprising British officials, was set up to advise on measures for dealing with air raids and, particularly, for protection against gas attack. This committee had the benefit of the advice of a British gas expert sent out by the War Office to organise anti-gas measures in the British forces. 156. Italian Colony .—The position of the Italian colony in Egypt numbering, according to some estimates, 65,000 persons, principally located in the large towns and including a large number of ardent' and active young Fascists who were believed to possess a certain number of automatics, &amp;c., was naturally, from the beginning, a source of anxiety. The Alexandria police authorities also antici pated trouble from groups of Libyan colonists who, though originally refugees, had been protected and armed by the Italian Consulate, and were considered good fighting material. Apart from the opportunities for espionage, hostile propaganda and sabotage in peace time, their presence also created the risk of serious^ internal disorders in the event of war, especially as they occupied many £c key ’ posts in the public utilities ” and in public services including the police and the postal and telephone services. In consultation with the British military authorities, the British officers in the Egyptian army and police and the European Department of the Ministry of Interior, steps were taken to guard against Italian activities in peace time and to deal with the question of internment in the event of war. 157. Special measures were also taken at Kosseir, a port on the Red Sea, w ich was found to be virtually controlled by the Italian Phosphate Company there and from there the dangers of raids against Sefaga or the oilfields at urgtiada and also against railway bridges and barrages in the Nile Valiev had to be considered. J ^u. s_twuj. j; rom me early days ot the crisis the question of th eventual necessity of imposing martial law exercised the minds of the Residenc arrnno-Am 8611 / 01 - in ^e Egyptian Government.

I his proposal was agreed to by the Foreign Office and arrangements W ! r tr W T° rked ^ c ? ordin g 1 y involving the issue of two proclamations, the establishment of British and Egyptian military courts to deal with the different categories referred to above. The Prime Minister was informed in general terms u tire proposals, but was not invited to agree to the detailed arrangements as it was felt that the time had not yet come when it was necessary to go so far in taking him into the confidence of His Majesty’s Government in this matter. Administration of Justice. 159. This year saw no changes in the personnel of the Judicial Adviser’s Office. Mr. Besly acted as Judicial Adviser during the absence of Sir Arthur Booth on leave during the summer. 160. Amin Anis Pasha was Minister of Justice throughout the year. As an administrator, he continued to prove himself honest and fair, and there has been no indication of the favouritism in judicial appointments which has generally been observable in the past. In other matters he has shown himself careful and reliable, if somewhat lacking in energy and initiative. 161. In collaboration with Abdel Wahab Pasha and Naguib-el-Hilali Bey, his colleagues of Finance and Education, he was responsible for the draft law on foreign officials in which he saw incorporated the amendments proposed by the acting Financial and Judicial Advisers. He also sat with the same two Ministers and the Judicial Adviser on the committee which prepared the legislation under which sanctions were imposed against Italy. He has been uniformly helpful in matters in which the legitimate interests of His Majesty’s Government have been concerned, and his relations with the Judicial Adviser have been without exception cordial and sympathetic. 162. The Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Mohammed Taher Nour Pasha, died in August. His earlier services as Procureur General had been recognised by the conferring upon him of an honorary K.B.E. In that position he had displayed marked independence and energy during the difficult period of preparing for and carrying through the trials for murders of British subjects, including that of the murderers of Sir Lee Stack. He had occupied the post of Under-Secretary for five years. He was succeeded by Mustapha Hanafy Bey, a judge of the Native Court of Appeal—an excellent appointment in every way. Mustapha Hanafy had, in fact, been Taher Hour’s Chef de Parquet and had distinguished himself in the conduct of the murder trials in court. 163. As Under-Secretary of State he should be certain to carry out the traditions of his office, and at the same time should be able to take a moie active part in the affairs of the Ministry instead of confining himself to matters ot personnel as was the traditional role of the late Taher Noui Pasha. members. Neither of these candidates was Court claimed that he must follow their adv Minister decided to cancel the delegation c! ■■■ ' ' ■ ' 34 By doing so he automatically filled the vacancy, as Labib Bey was a member of tlic Court who hud bGGn sooondod to serve us Procureur Grenerul. C nf 01 tunutely this wus done with only ubout twenty-four hours’ notice to Lubib Bey himself, so thut he wus offended und threutened to resign. Eventuully, however, he wus persuuded to withdruw his resignution. 167. As Procureur Generul Lubib Bey set an example of hard a„„. conscientious work which gave the tone of the whole of the native parquet, and he will be much missed there. 168. The new Procureur General, Mahmud-el-Margoushy Bey, came from the Native Court of Appeal with a good reputation. He was unfortunate in having public opinion immediately focussed upon him in connexion with the December riots, when the unwillingness of the parquet to assist the police by recording the evidence and conducting the prosecutions in a practical and vigorous manner was very marked, and contributed to a considerable extent to the unusual licence allowed to the demonstrators. It is fair to say, however, that this attitude of the parquet was due partly to the failure of subordinates and very largely to the lack of resolution displayed by the Prime Minister. 169. Apart from the December riots there was no conspicuous friction this year between the parquet and the police, and the former has, on the whole, worked efficiently, considering the unsatisfactory state of the administration of criminal justice in the native courts. 170. Mr. Payne, Chief Inspector of the Central Parquet, continued to do excellent work, and is now a force to be reckoned with by the Procureur General in all matters directly or indirectly affecting Europeans in his Department. 171. The vacancy in the State Legal Department caused by the elevation of Naguib Bey El Hilali to the Ministry in 1934 remained unfilled until November, when a rather colourless individual, Ahmed Yassine Bey, was appointed. This appointment was made on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice against the wish of the Contentieux Committee, which Badaoui Pasha had persuaded to select with unanimity Raouf Bey Zaki, a Conseiller Royal adjoint, and a great personal friend of his own.

This was aeait with by a reprimand addressed to the judges in question by the president , y^ lxe d Court of Appeal. A similar protest which did not, however, criticise the police was addressed by the judges of the Native Court of Appeal in Cairo, this action drew from the Minister a rebuke which the judges regarded as a reprimand such as could only be given by a Council of Discipline, and a dispute arose which was still under consideration at the end of the year. Such conduct was clearly incompatible with that impartiality which is expected from judges who may be called upon to try cases arising out of political disorders. It did in fact directly encourage the lower courts to show leniency to the demonstrators who were charged before them, and it obviously put the Minister in a very difficult position. 176. The replies of the Powers to the note addressed to them in 1934 on the subject of the presidency of chambers and the use of the Arabic language have now all been received, and were unanimously favourable. It was found necessary, however, to address a further note to each Power submitting a textual modification of the reglement which would establish the eligibility of Egyptian judges to preside over chambers, and to this note replies have only yet been received from Great Britain, Portugal, France and Belgium. The French reply contains a reserve insisting that it must be understood and, if necessary, made clear in the reglement that the Egyptian judges are not to be appointed to sit alone as judges of summary courts. The text proposed would be susceptible of the interpretation feared by the French Government, and indeed it would be hard to draft an amendment which would allow Egyptian judges to preside over chambers and yet exclude them from sittings as summary judges otherwise than by a specific text to that effect. Both the Greek Minister and the Dutch Charge d’Affaires have raised the same point unofficially while considering their own reply. 177. The president of the Court of Cassation, Abdel Aziz Fahmy Pasha, continued to hold office during the year, but retires on reaching the age limit in January 1936. No decision has yet been taken as to his successor. 178. The vacancy created in 1934 in the post of president of the Native Court of Appeal on the appointment of Amin Anis Pasha as Minister was filled by Etibi Abdul Ezz Bey. 179. The work of the native courts in criminal matters showed an improve ment in numbers of cases disposed of. The courts of assize had to meet a geneia increase of serious crimes and succeeded in dealing with a larger number of cases than in the previous year or years. This increased energy was, however, quite inadequate to deal with the accumulated arrears and there were ^ nendinsr at the end than at the beginning of the year. The delay in brmgi g offendere to iustice thus involved is one of the chief causes of the ineffectiveness of the iudicial machine and requires drastic treatment. Misdemeanours this yea showed 7 1 further increase of 42,805 or about 18 per cent, on the inflated figures of list year This increase is no doubt mainly due to the economic stringency which persisted during the year, particularly in the agricultural districts. 180 Maior crimes against Europeans, on the other hand, showed an appre- ciabll decreasi, which is probably due to the exemplary sentences passed by the courts in several recent cases. , i si The work of the native courts was, however, marred at the end of the year by the behaviour of -rtain magis = ftm pofetfluencl showed themselves once more unaWyo insulate themselves ^ P for ^ IcteTSanismVthe students sols to justify acquittal or the application of a merely nominal sentence. , the editor of the Siassa, at 182.

An appeal has been entered, but it is not certain at present if it will be persisted in. 183. Further cases in the Sharia Courts served to emphasise the necessity for reform, particularly as regards matrimonial cases. The trouble lies less in the faulty application of law than in the nature of the law itself which has totJ applied by the Sharia Courts, whereby, e.g., a man can evade his marital responsi bilities by the simple act of turning Moslem. As it is impossible to change Koranic Law, the only solution is to provide non-Moslem Courts of Statut Personnel as proposed under the scheme of reform which was initiated by Aly Maher Pasha when Minister of Justice. This scheme is now dormant, the committee ad hoc, though still in existence, not having met during the year. It will need a strong Minister of Justice, backed by a strong Government, to carry through such a measure in the face of the opposition it will arouse in Sharia and other reactionary circles. It should, however, eventually be effected in the same way as it has been found possible in the past to avoid the application of the barbarous penalties of the Sharia law in criminal matters, by the establishment of other competent criminal courts which are not bound to apply such law. Legislation. 184. The amount of legislation passed during the year has been less as regards quantity and, apart from one or two Acts of major importance from a political point of view, there have been no outstanding achievements on the part of Nessim Pasha’s Government. At the same time, a number of useful small reforms have been effected. There being no enactmnts worthy of note in the sphere of legal jurisdiction or procedure, it is'proposed to deal with the year’s measures under two headings only, viz., “Economic and Financial” and “Social and Administrative.” 180 . i ne mam enactment ot tne year m the economic and financial sphere was undoubtedly the decree-law (No. 45) of the 2nd May declaring null and void gold clauses contained in contracts involving international payments and expressed in Egyptian pounds, pounds sterling or other foreign currencies -which were legal tender m Egypt (franc or Turkish pound). Payments under conven iens or an angements relating to postal, telegraphic or telephone services were exenipted from the law This law was not approved by the Mixed Courts or by Mixed Courts nd Va ldlty 18 at P resent contested by means of actions in the prove^as sltisflc^ff^Vu l? 34 T th l : eference to the motor-car tax did not p ove as satisfactory as had been hoped.

Commissions of estimation were established in each village composed of a representative of the Ministry of Finance, a representative of the Survey Eepartment, two landowners and the omdah, and provision made for appeal to a second commission under the presidency of the mudir by an aggrieved land- owner No recourse from the decision of either tribunal to the courts is to be allowed. 190. The question of mortgages of lands also occupied the attention of the -Legislature. By a decree of the 30th May a new company was formed out of the Mortgage Department of the “ Credit Agricole d’Egypte ” under the title of Credit Hypothecaire Agricole d’Egypte.” The Government was authorised to guarantee the share capital of this company up to £E. 2 million, and it took over on the 11th July the debts of the Mortgage Company of Egypt amounting to the sum of £E. 2,027,609-580 m/ms. By an “ arrete ” of the 18th July a committee was instituted for the settlement of claims arising on second or subsequent mortgages composed of representatives of various banks under the chairmanship of the Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Finance. 191. Excise duties on playing cards, cement, sugar and benzine were varied during the year by decrees, and an exemption from duty granted to wines made of Egyptian grapes. Provision was made for a rebate in excise duty on Egyptian products exported to the Sudan for consumption there. 192. Other miscellaneous enactments coming under this head included modification of the entertainment tax in Cairo and Alexandria, the formation of a new committee of valuation for expropriations of land in Cairo. 193. The output of legislation on social and administrative matters during the year was distinctly meagre. The most important reforms were in connexion with the statutes of the Egyptian University and its various faculties. 194. By Decree-Law No. 57 of the 23rd May, Egypt’s full and exclusive sovereignty in the atmospheric space over its territory was declared and power was taken to issue regulations relating to aerial navigation by decree. In pursuance of this law (which was not submitted to the Mixed Courts for approval) a decree which had already been approved by the Mixed Court of Appeal was promulgated on the same day forbidding any flight over Egyptian territory without previous authorisation of the Minister of Communications. The decree contained detailed provisions regulating the issue of such authorisations similar to those in force in other countries. 195. On the 29th August power was taken to grant a monopoly to the Egyotian company, Misr Airwork, to establish service stations for aeroplanes, and schools of instruction, to conduct aerial tours of Egypt, to carry on coastal trade and at the Government’s discretion, to carry out special missions such as surveying; ’ photography, transport of officials, &amp;c. Provisions were also made for subventions to the company in respect of its flying schools and each regular air line operated by it. 196. Legislation made necessary by the international situation included as well as the sanctions, decree-law (No. 145) which was passed on the h ; 8t ^ r ^ t eI ^ be o r | a decree-law of the 14th of the same month authorising the Ministry o± the Interior to order suspension and seizure of any newspaper containing matter likely to preiudice public security and order. Such suspension was limited to fifteen days or forty-five days in case of weekly journals, but could be renewed o further offence. 197 Other miscellaneous measures passed during the year included “ srretos ’’ reorganising the councils of discipline m the Ministries of A^ricul- [133997Superior Labour Council, a decree forbidding the export of animals useful for agriculture or transport, and a decree limiting the hours of work m certain industries. 198 Two decree-laws of the 9th May amended the t£ reglement organique ” of the Faculty of Law and Letters, and on the 12th August a further decree-lp - (No 91) incorporated in the university the Royal Polytechnic School of Commerce and the Veterinary School. New chairs in Moslem archaeology and Moslem history were also created, and modifications made in the statutes relating to the organisation of the university and the conditions of service of the teaching staff. British Education and Culture. 199. The High Commissioner’s Advisory Committee on Education held further meetings in the early part of the year, and submitted a comprehensive report in April, which was forwarded to the Foreign Office. This report was based on the assumption that an annual sum of £5,000 would be available for British cultural needs in Egypt. The committee’s first concern was British schools, which it regarded as the most important part of its educational task. Such questions as Maltese education and the establishment of a British Institute were reserved for later treatment. The committee’s recommendations were as follows :— (1) Annual grant to the English Mission College (International), Cairo, to be made conditional on reorganisation : £250. (2) Annual grant to St. Andrew’s School (Scottish School for Boys), Alexandria : £100. (3) Annual grant to Maltese School, Suez : £100. (4) Initial grant for equipment of proposed English School, Port Said : £ 200 . (5) Annual grant to proposed English School, Port Said : £750. N.B.—Should the Treasury find it impossible to increase the grant of the English School, Cairo, it will be necessary to provide for a substantial annual grant for that school. 200. The balance of the money available, at any rate for the first year, should be devoted to the establishment of a British Institute. 201. In drawing up these recommendations, the committee were under the impression that the necessary funds would be provided by the British Council for Foreign Relations, a semi-official organisation formally constituted in 1935 under the chairmanship of Lord Tyrrell and the honorary presidency of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, to develop and co-ordinate, with official support, British cultural propaganda throughout the world. The British Council was not, however, able to obtain sufficient funds from official sources and from the general public to devote £5,000 for Egypt in the year 1935. The committee’s ore urgent, demands, i.e., for assistance for schools, were therefore submitted to the Ltottor/ 01, P elr t nanclal sll PP or t- The Treasury were prepared to admit mixed n^if h 0f assl srtng propaganda schools on British lines for children of new FuThsI, rfw’« a v, d ‘i' ^ the y a g reed to make a grant of £10,000 to the admit the necessity f 0 ° l m Alexandria.

The Education Committee resumed its meetings in November in some disappointment that, apart from the grant to the English Girls’ College in Alexandria, there had been so little response to its recommendations, in spite of the great effort in support of British education in Egypt which had been made by the local communities in Cairo and Alexandria in response to the Jubilee appeal. In the absence of any indication regarding the funds which might be available from the British Council for Foreign Relations to be devoted to objects other than British schools in Egypt, for which Treasury support was expected, the committee doubted the advisability of drawing up any detailed recommenda tions for (1) Maltese education, or (2) a British institute. In view, moreover, of the tense situation in the Near East and the Italian danger, the High Commissioner emphasised most urgently to the Foreign Office, in a despatch of the 5th December, the immediate political importance of developing and extending British cultural activities in Egypt, and asked for an early indication of the British Council’s policy and financial prospects. 204. Towards the end of the year the committee received more encouraging information regarding the attitude of the Treasury towards assisting British schools in Egypt, and as to the financial prospects of the British Council. The latter have established an Educational Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Riverdale, with a sub-committee to deal specially with the Near East under the chairmanship of Lord Lloyd. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in a speech at the inaugural meeting of the British Council had, moreover, stated that special attention would be devoted to the needs of Egypt. Although the financial resources of the Council were still uncertain, the Foreign Office stated in December that a sum of at least £11,000, and probably considerably more, was earmarked for Egypt in the financial year 1935-36. Finally, it was announced that Lord Lloyd was visiting Egypt in January to examine local requirements on the spot. The committee, therefore, whilst still pressing its much reduced demands for Treasury assistance for British schools in Egypt, proceeded to consider a scheme drawn up by Mrs. Elgood for setting up a British institute in Cairo. 205. The position as regards Maltese education was somewhat difficult. The critical situation of the Maltese school at Suez during the summer, from which it was rescued by temporary grants from the Maltese Government and the Suez Canal Company, had made this an urgent issue. Although of great Imperial importance, Maltese education was not a problem which the committee felt should be allowed to come before specifically British needs and schemes. It was clear ftiaf CHa Inro'o sums reouired to enable British schools to be established d 4 [13399]207. Victoria College, 4 Z^a^na-This school had another satisfactory year, and the number of pupils increased from 359 to 4(Jb. 208. English Girls’ College. —As reported above, this school was started successfully in temporary premises in October, ana had to turn down applicants from the start, opening with over 100 pupils. 209 British Boys’ School. —This school had another successful year, with no financial difficulties. Mr. Thomson, the headmaster, received the O.B.E. m the New Year Honours List, 1936. The number of pupils was 350, and many applications were refused owing to lack of accommodation. 210. Scottish School for Boys.—This school has continued to do good work under extremely difficult conditions. The number of pupils was about 220, of many different nationalities, with a nucleus of twenty Butish. unfortunately, it does not seem possible to obtain official financial assistance for this school, in view of its missionary character. 211. English School, Cairo. —Scholastically the school had an excellent year its energetic headmaster, Mr. Grose. The number of pupils rose from 386 to 409. Financially there was a heavy deficit of £E. 1,200, which will be met in part by the increase in His Majesty’s Government’s grant to £3,000 for the year 1936. The success of the Jubilee appeal will in time enable the school to move into new buildings, and building schemes are at present under consideration. But the general financial outlook remains somewhat critical. In view of the Egyptian Government’s offer of a site for the new school it was decided to admit Egyptian pupils within a limited proportion of the small percentage of foreign pupils already admitted. This will not in practice affect the character or composition of the school. 212. English Mission College. —This school had the most successful year in its existence, having 550 pupils of many different nationalities. £E. 5,000 having already been obtained for building purposes, the decision was taken to start building early in 1936 the new boys’ and girls’ colleges at Koubbeh. Some £E. 5,000 is still needed to cover the cost of these buildings, which should be ready in October 1936. Unfortunately, His Majesty’s Government, in view of the missionary associations of the school, are precluded from granting financial assistance. Mr. Martin, the headmaster, received an O.B.E. in the Birthday Honours. British Examinations in Egypt. 213. London University examinations held in Egypt have previously been restricted to British candidates, and the examinations have been held only at the Victoria College, Alexandria. As a result of representations from the Residency, the London University authorities early in 1935 agreed to open these examina tions to non-British candidates. Hie Egyptian Government have raised nc objection, and arrangements have been made for non-British candidates to sit tor these examinations in July 1936 and in subsequent years. They will be held m future at the English School, Cairo, as well as in Alexandria, and in December many additional applications had already been received. These arrangements have been made m close consultation with the American University, Cairo many ot whose pupils wish to take these English examinations. secuGut tS e f ? gy n ti i in / ut ^? r ^ es ^ 1 ^ e a ^ so k een approached with a view to Simla Hnn hi 0x U d ai d Sch ° o1 Certificate and the London TwU.C T- exam J n . at . lons be regarded as equivalent to the Egyptian U ; , at l , n 'I 113 'ifymg their holders for entry into the Egyptian University Certificate^abeadCaualifie' 1 ' j ns ! at }\ ,aons - The Word and^mbridge Sch-1 service and the V t hok l erS U entr y into Egyptian Government tUr “tt L gy.P tlaa authorities have been asked to admit the eauivalenee of 0 zzfesrSsrf. ~r T1 ” necessary arrangements were Uadt fok u nT rei l u ? sts &gt; Provided that the Egyptian History &amp;c He L ♦ / candl dates to be qualified in Arabic, ^d to^e’disposed41 Egyptian University. 215. The position has been far from satisfactory durine’ the year owing to the unsuitability of Professor Sencourt, the professor of English literature and vice-dean, for the administrative duties of his post. In May the ^igh Commissioner found it necessary to give Professor Sencourt a straight ,.arning that his activities and intrigues were prejudicial to British prestige in the university and must cease. He was told that the possibility of advising the Egyptian Grovernment to cancel his contract had even been considered Professor Sencourt’s contract normally expires in the summer of 1936 and efforts have been made to find a suitable successor. Mr. Furness, a former oriental secretary at the Residency, has been pioposed, and his candidature was viewed with favour by the Egyptian authorities. 216. Early in 1935 the possibility of appointing an English vice-rector was considered, the suggestion having come from the Prime Minister, the Egyptian Minister in London and from other prominent Egyptians. Such a post would have carried with it extensive administrative powers and have enabled the professor of English literature to restrict his activities to his professorial duties. A suitable candidate for the post was found in Sir W. W. Hornell, vice-chancellor of Hong Kong University, but in view of the difficulties experienced in appointing a high British official as technical adviser to the Ministry of Commerce, it was decided in the summer that this proposal must be dropped for the present as it would give rise to too much Nationalist feeling against the creation of another important post for a British subject. 217. Lufti Sayed resigned from the post of rector under the Sidky Govern ment as a protest against the arbitrary removal of Hr. Taher Hussein from the university by Hilmi Issa, the Minister of Education, who acted at the direction of the King. Hr. Taher Hussein was reinstated in the university almost immediately after the advent of Nessim to power. Nessim wished to complete this act of justice by reinstating Lufti Sayed as rector, but the King’s opposition was only overcome in May as part of our intervention against Ibrashi and Palace obstruction of the Prime Minister. Lufti Sayed is a weak man and made no attempt to curb the political activities of the university students in November and Hecember. Sayed has also Liberal Constitutionalist sympathies, and was perhaps inclined to facilitate Mohamed Mahmoud’s incitement of students for party purposes. Taha Hussein, now a Wafdist, no doubt encouraged disorders among the students in Wafdist interests. But he was one of many professorial agitators, though perhaps the most important. These disorders are fully described in the political section of this report, and it is sufficient to record here that they resulted in the university being closed by the Government during the greater part of those months. 218. The English staff at the university have put forward demands for increases in pay, which are being considered in connexion with the Simpson scheme ” for improving the position of British secondary school teachers. Secondary Education. 219. The respective positions of English and French in Egyptian secondary education have been under consideration in connexion with proposals by ±&gt; ritl sh inspectors in the Ministry of Education to increase the hours devoted to the teaching; of English In May the Minister of Education, Hilah Bey, produced a report fhowing, inter alia, that it was necessary to lighten the educational curriculum, but in which he decided in favour of preserving the existing balance between the hours devoted to English and those devoted to French. Since English alreadv slightly predominates and the Minister’s argument m favour of lightening the svlMbus was P sound, whilst he proposed also to improve the actual teaching of English and to provide increased credits for the purpose, the Foreign Office in June concurred in the Residency’s recommendation not to press the English inspectors’ proposal, and to accept the continuance of the status quo. 990 ThP Minister of Education’s report, which was very well received m 220. a t Up noli cv of excessive centralisation followed by the Ministry srasraws 'sri p s 5 “ s ss aasssss to .““Jnd A, I, fJhmg to to.

At the end of 1935 no definite decision had yet been taken upon it, but the educational situation had, of course, been rendered difficult by the frequency of Nationalist agitation in the form of political strikes and disturbances by secondary school students in November and December. These are fully reported upon in the political sections of this report. 222. Mr. Simpson, after his appointment as the official in charge of the interests of British teachers in the public instruction, prepared a scheme for improving the pay and prospects of promotion of these teachers, and at the same time securing them greater permanency of tenure and more just and uniform treatment than at present obtains. His scheme was generally approved by Hilali Bey, Minister of Education in Nessim Pasha’s Government, but it was held up for detailed consideration in the Ministry of Finance, since it entailed increased expenditure. Before any decision could be reached further delay ensued owing to the connexion of the “Simpson Scheme” with proposals for a comprehensive draft law to cover the position of all foreign officials in Egyptian Government service. This draft law raised important question of principle which had to be referred to the Foreign Office, and no decision could be reached upon it or the Simpson scheme by the end of 1935. Meanwhile, the Association of British Teachers has represented frequently to the Residency the urgency of their grievances. Nile Control. 223. General .—Supplies of water were plentiful throughout the year. During the low summer period river levels were above normal, and 5,000 millions of cubic metres of water were contributed by the greater Assouan Reservoir, which had been filled to capacity, R.L. 121, for the first time since the completion of the second heightening. Nearly half a million feddans of land were cultivated with rice. 224. The river rose rapidly in June and July and the flood was exceptionally early. The interesting feature of the flood was the continuance of high levels over a prolonged period, though the highest levels reached were not as high as in the preceding year. 225. Satisfactory progress was made on the strengthening of the Assiout Barrage, and it is anticipated that the work will be completed in 1938. The contractors for the work are Messrs. J. Cochrane and Sons (Limited). ,, O.XX X ^±11 CL 111 clt purposes. an interesting monument and for traffic/O? 43 n a ^ e Tsana - On the 24th January invitations were addressed bv the a coX^atTMcrthe'whirT 61118 °t Egypt the Sudan t0 Participate 7 conxerence at which the White Corporation would submit their renort The hey had hXaZJe **7™ ?

As reo-ards the former the attitude of the Egyptian Government had previously not°been entirely satisfactory, a committee having in 1932 put forward certain monetary claims m respect of the alleged detrimental effects of the Lake Tsana scheme on other irrigation works in Egypt. A preliminary conference was accordingly arranged between the Egyptian and Sudan Governments, and an entirely satisfactory agreement was reached which provided, briefly, for the Egyptian Government to undertake 90 per cent, of the cost and maintenance, with the right to a similar proportion of the water, the remaining 10 per cent, being undertaken by the Sudan Government, who have, however, the right to increase their share of the water, with a corresponding increase of both maintenance and construction expenses, up to a total of 50 per cent. 231. Copies of the White Corporation’s report were delivered to the Egyptian and Sudan Governments in April, and the Ethiopian Government suggested on the 10th May that a conference should be held at Addis Ababa at the beginning of June. They were informed in reply by both the Egyptian and Sudan Governments that they considered this date too early for a proper study of the report, but that as early a date as possible would be suggested. Finally, on the 9th June Mr. Eden informed the House of Commons that in order to avoid taking any steps which might aggravate the controversy between Italy and Ethiopia, His Majesty’s Government had informed the Ethiopian Government that they favoured postponement of the scheme. 232. Towards the end of March enquiries were set on foot through Mr. Rickett (of subsequent Africa Oil Development Company fame), acting on behalf of Messrs. Balfour, Beatty and Co., as to the possibility of a British firm obtaining the contract instead of the White Corporation. Messrs. Balfour, Beatty and Co were informed by the Foreign Office that while they might not have the support of His Majesty’s Government, the latter would not actively oppose them pending further consideration of the whole position after the receipt of the White Corporation’s report. On instructions from the Foreign Office it was ascertained from the Ethiopian Government that in spite of the Emperor’s former insistence on the employment of a firm belonging to a limitrophe country, he would now welcome agreement with a reputable British firm because he held that any settle ment of outstanding questions with His Majesty’s Government would strengthen his position vis-a-vis Italy. It was also ascertained that the Egyptian Govern ment would be only too glad to employ a British firm rather than the White Corporation, to whom they were in no way committed, but that they would prefer the White Corporation to any other non-British firm. This proposal would, how ever, involve certain practical difficulties, such as the scrapping of all the pre liminary work done by the White Corporation. Land Reclamation Schemes. 233 The second heightening of the Aswan dam, finished in 1933, and the approaching completion in 1936 of the Gebel Awlia dam involve the bringing of considerable new areas within range of irrigation and cultivation and the Egyptian Government have therefore been studying (somewhat belatedly) various land reclamation schemes. The present position of such schemes is as follows. 234 In consequence of the effective work of the fifteen pumping stations in the northern delta, an area of 410 000 feddans of unreclaimed land ha^ teen drained • of this area 280,000 feddans is owned by the Go ™ r nment and 140 000 feddans is owned by private proprietors. Of the total area 65,000 feddans IdH receivfrter film the heightened Aswan dam and the remainder will receive 7aterTom7he Gebel Awlia dam. The State Domains Department wish to see9n nno fprldans reclaimed every year—that is to say, canals dug, irrigation services completed,^and theland wash^and pur.fied of its salty quaht^a They w 1S h to reclaim 8 000 feddans a year themselves, and to have 12,000 teddans a yea reclaimed’by private or semi-official enterprises, although they can do it them selves if necessary. The land so reclaimed would be distributed to the small fel a in lots of between 5 and 50 feddans. A certain amount would be sold as boo . land to wealthy landowners, who would do reclamations themselves unassisted, such lots would vary between 50 and 1,000 feddans. 235 The Council of the State Domains Department began some time ago .V. ava tyvi nafirm nf three alternative methods of reclamation. These were (i) Sale of the land to companies on condition that when reclaimed it will be resold to the fellaheen. , , (ii) The engagement of contractors to do the work and hand over the land when ready. _ . ..... . . (iii) The formation of companies with Tgyptian participation m the capital, expressly for the purpose of reclaiming land and handing it back after a specified time in fit condition to grow a first-class cotton crop. So far the committee’s deliberations have led them to eliminate (ii). It would apparently take about 13 or 14 years to reclaim all the land which has been ear marked in the northern, eastern and southern delta as suitable for such an operation. It will be possible during the reclamation period to grow various kinds of crops, e.g., by the end of the second year the land would be sufficiently “sweetened” to grow “ berseem ” (clover)—at a later stage, after further washing and “ sweetening ” has taken place, rice could be grown, and after three or four years cotton, although the latter would not be of first-class quality until after six years. 236. According to the State Domains Department the cost of fully reclaiming a feddan of land is £E. 30. The average annual revenue from crops grown should amount, after the second year, to about £E. 13 or £E. 14. 237. The State Domains Council has the whole matter under consideration, and it is understood to favour alternative (iii) above. Foreign Officials. 238. The following changes have taken place in the foreign personnel of the Government service during the year 1935 for officials occupying posts graded V and upwards. 239. The lists include judges of the Mixed Courts and doctors of the Quarantine Board. 240. Excluding the university and the Ministry of Education, fifteen British officials have left the service; ten of these have been replaced by other Britishers; the appointment of British officials to three posts is under consideration and two have been succeeded by Egyptians. In no case has a British official been succeeded by any non-British European. 241. In the 1 acuity of Letters of the Egyptian University an Italian ecturer has been succeeded by an Englishman. Three British lecturers have left the I acuity ol Science and have been, or will be, succeeded by Egyptians. 242. The adoption of the Minister of Education’s reforms has resulted in an increase of the number of English inspectors by three and of assistant masters by eighteen, the corresponding numbers of Frenchmen are one and twelve. One nghsh lady, formerly an assistant mistress, has been promoted to the inspectorate. increasecHjy thrU S ^ d ° Ct0rS engaged in sch ° o1 inspection lias been w A government produced a new version of the draft regulating the employment of foreigners in the Government service The drafl law began by stating that a foreifner should not be appointed to anvtmblii “^ForeifftT’offichils^ y llltal 7&gt;m exceptional circumstances, and sefup 8 foreign Officials Committee consisting of the Under-Secretaries of Staff the UafranshSAXe M^WeAtanceUc famine the employment of foreigners. ’ examme a11 questions concerning45 leave 2 was ted, and ^matter wn^/ 16 draf i. law the advisers, then on their qualms were overcome and''the. rr ^ their return. Subsequently strongldvocate of the draft la w on a?, Fm f an “f ^ dvls £ er ultimately became a rsr “« zzxtg! constitutional reasons the word itself was Ivoided. P ’ altnough tor u he Hl ^ h Commissi o n ei' felt that the law, if passed, would make much ?? 0 -® appointments such as those the Prime Minister had recently agreed to m the Frontiers Administration, the Suez Canal Police, &amp;c. The Oriental Secretary also drew attention to the difficulty likely to be caused by the law as regards posts not covered by the “ reserved points ” and yet requiring British officials for the proper safeguarding of British interests. Accordingly the High Commissioner withdrew the authorisation given to the Financial Adviser to go ahead, arranged for the submission of the draft law to the Council of Ministers to be postponed, and referred the matter again to the Foreign Office. 247. In particular it was felt that it would be extremely difficult to get any special appointment past a Committee of Under-Secretaries, and that in fact it would be more difficult for such a committee to agree to appointments we thought necessary to safeguard our interests than it would be for a friendly Prime Minister acting on his own initiative, in the face of the opening paragraph of the law. On the other hand it seemed clear that the Egyptian Government would never agree to dropping the Committee of Under-Secretaries, which the advisers considered would emasculate the law from their point of view. It was suggested to the Foreign Office that a way out of the difficulty would be to give the Prime Minister or Council of Ministers an overriding power exercisable at discretion. The matter was still under consideration at the end of the year. Egyptian State Broadcasting. 248. At the end of last year Dr. Hafez Affix Pasha and Hassan Fahmy Rifaat Bey were appointed to the Broadcasting Programme Board, replacing Mohamed Khaled Hassanein Bey and Bedawi Khalifa Bey. 249. In March the Foreign Office passed on reports from the India Office, drawing attention to intelligence reports from Koweit, and Arab States bordering on the Persian Gulf showing the growing interest being taken in the Cairo daily news broadcasts, and tlxe spi’ead of the desire amongst the Arabs to own receiving sets. The reports expressed anxiety regarding the dangers of these developments should the broadcasting station in Cairo not be under proper control. The Foreign Office were referred to Sir Percy Loraine’s despatch No. 702, Secret, of the 23rd July, 1932, which showed that control had been provided for, while the notes then exchanged showed that the Egyptian Govern ment considered it desirable to prevent the use of the broadcast service as an instrument of political propaganda against any political party, or personage, any foreign State, or its nationals. 250. The possible dangers were revealed by an incident in June, when the French Minister drew the attention of the Director-General, European Department, to a broadcast in Arabic by Film Abaza, a regular broadcaster, regarding the alleged kidnapping of a Moslem girl by a missionary school, in which he appealed to Moslem fanaticism, and grossly and violently attacked foreign schools in Egypt, describing them as white-slave traders Mr. Keown- Bovd took the matter up with the Marconi Company, who explained that tne occurrence was due to an oversight, and that they were taking steps to prevent a repetition of anything of the sort. 251 In August a controvery arose over a decision of the Prime Ministei to have Koran reading after 5 p.m. stopped. The Programme Board conformed to the Prime Minister’s wishes, but on the understanding that the responsi i i y rested on the Government and the Government representatives on the board. Itappeared that the mitiative .^, me / r ^ ^haf beh^g no? trLrta^X 6 Koran- selves, the object of the bhei ' ^ , doinl good, but to seek a means wh ''' ‘“°“ 0 li,uor was sold. . i 9&lt;S9 Tn Seotember the Prime Minister informed the Minister ot 252. in septemnei Kerim Tabet of the Mokattam appointed as Communications ^^^hme Board in succession of Loutfy Bey, who was Oriental Achiser to tne t 10 iam Kerim Tabet is a Christian Jew to be transferred to f^e subieft and it was obviously undesirable to of Syrian origin and a Bnt sh subject a broadcastin of have him in this P^. *6 holder^ of whicn^a^ dignitaries Nessim Pa 0 sha n had awarentlv contemplated that Kerim Tabet could continue his Journalistic S while holding this post, but it turned out that this was not so. fn the circumstances it was not worth his while and the matter was dropped. Wireless News Messages. . n i . 253 Serious attempts were made from the beginning of the year to devise means of enforcing the Wireless Law, to prevent the unauthorised reception of wireless news messages, and to give the Egyptian Government the neces^ry power to exclude undesirable political messages from publication. On the 16th January the Director-General, European Department, and the Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of the Interior, accordingly agreed upon a revised version of the formula quoted m paragraph 352 of the annual report for 1934, the amended text of which was as follows :— ct The direct reception for publication in Egypt of any broadcast messages sent by wireless telegraphy or telephony from a foreign station may only be undertaken by the Egyptian company specifically licensed by the Egyptian Government for that purpose. The reception of such messages is undertaken by the company so licensed in virtue of authorisation issued by the Egyptian Government in favour of approved persons or news agencies who desire to publish the messages in Egypt. Such authorisations will contain a provision excluding political propaganda, and will be revokable for breach of this or any other condition of the authorisation. A fee will be payable to the company holding the licence from the Egyptian Govern ment by the persons or news agencies employing their services in the above-mentioned connexion.” 254. The use of the phrase in this formula, “ The Egyptian company,” avoided direct reference to the Marconi Company, to which the Under-Secretary of State objected, and which was in itself undesirable. 255. Before action had been taken on this formula an alternative proposal was made by Mr. Cecil Campbell of the Marconi Company and Mr. Delany of Reuter’s. This was that the Egyptian Government should let the press know that they intended to enforce the law, but that they would make arrangements by which newspapers could obtain from the Government certain C.Q. news messages at a rate to be decided on in conjunction with the press. The idea was that the Government having ascertained the cost of receipt of the messages from Marconi, would provide a disguised subsidy so that they could issue Government messages to the press, on request, at cheaper rates than Reuter’s and the other commercial services. The advantage of this scheme was that it would keep Marconi s out of the picture, would leave the Egyptian Government in control of what should or should not be justified, and would go a long way to meet the press clamour to be allowed to receive these Government messages. The arrangement, moreover, was to be confined to genuine C.Q. Government messages broadcast for general reception, and would not include the addressed disguised Government messages (e-g., the German) which are simply attempts to side-step the Madrid regulations. r j r r j^ ie ^ 0re jS n Office approved this alternative proposal, and a scheme was worked out on those lines, the press having the opportunity of deciding what n lne a • i^nment news service in addition to the British official ss ey esired. Tee 1 rime Minister, who had been much shaken by the47 £E. 1,(}00 being 1»„, „ f’ESS/ElSP S StF' 0 ™? messages, the Inspector-General of Telegraphs was most antinv,? t • a g eno y s~*. 4'™ Government countmg on making up the loss of about £E. 4 225 per annumTnvolved out of new agreements with agencies which had hitherto stood out. mvolved i a- 257 ' (J ' tlle 25 J 1 ^ e I ltc,Tl f ,er letters were duly sent off to the twentv-two f t f s P a P ers d ; a 4 m 8' attention to the provisions of articles 3 4 dated 5 thl 6th de i™° f iq2fi 10th a M- artlCle 2 ° f the minis terial order aated. tne otn June, 1926, as modified by Ministerial Order No. 39 of 1933 regu atmg radio-electric communications, which the Government declared they were determined to have strictly observed. The letter added that the Govern ment, however, had agreed with the Marconi Company of Egypt to deliver free of charge a copy of the British official wireless to those newspapers undertakino- not tomtercept illicitly, or cause to be so intercepted, news telegrams transmitted by radio from abroad, or publish any news that might have been intercepted through unauthorised channels. It also announced the reduction of the royalty payable to the Government on multiple news telegrams from 1 millieme to J millieme per word. 258. Some misgivings were felt both in the Residency and the Foreign Office about this arrangement being thus limited to the British official wireless. The Foreign Office view was that they had no desire to obtain, or at any rate to have the appearance of obtaining, privileged treatment for the British official wireless, nor to compel its reception if there was no demand for it, nor to prevent the reception of other foreign non-copyright news if there was a demand for that. They considered that each of these services should be treated strictly on its merits, and should only be censored or totally forbidden if its tone should render such action necessary. It was, however, still open to the press to ask for other services, and actually no complaints from the representatives of foreign news services were heard. 259. The Prime Minister, Nessim Pasha, who was also Minister of the Interior, then suddenly wobbled, and it was found that raids had been suspended against Kerim Tabet of the Mokattam, who had asked for a respite. Nessim Pasha was bolstered up by the Oriental Secretary, the help of Shaker Bey, the General Manager of the Egyptian State Railways, Telephones and Telegraphs, was enlisted, and raids continued, with the result that by the 16th October the following newspapers had given the undertaking desired, viz., Liberte, Tachydromos, Al Ahram, Ittihad, Al Balagh, Basseer, Wadi-el-Nil, the Egyptian Gazette, La Bourse egyptienne (Cairo and Alexandria), the Egyptian Mail, La Patrie, and Anatoli. 260. Old Dr. Nimr of the Mokattam, however, remained adamant, refused to give a written undertaking, and was only prepared to give a verbal one “provided his honour was not held to be involved if he broke it.” When, on the 17th October, the Mokattam was raided, and its receiving set removed, Dr. Nimr squealed and protested indignantly that he had arranged with the Prime Minister and the Residency that there would be no interference with his set. He remains the nigger in the woodpile for, obviously, if he is allowed to continue flouting the law, the papers which have come into line will tend to slip back until things are again in a complete state of chaos. Two other papers which stood out were Al Gehad and Rose-el-Youssef, which Reuter’s complained were openly continuing to pirate their Rugby News Service. The Societe Radio Orient. 261. For some time sudden and substantial falling-off in business from certain firms had led the Marconi Company of Egypt to suspect that the Frenc Radio Orient Company were adopting illegitimate methods to attract traffic Dffin the Marconi and Eastern Telegraph Companies. Official records showed tha e48 traffic from Egypt via “ im. Finally, ^ given by the Radio Orient Company on all approved of what was going on. 262 The Inspector-General of the Egyptian State Telegraphs accordingly recommended the general manager of the Egyptian State Purlin Orient should no longer be accepted by the State lelegiapn in accordance with article 33 of the International Telegraph Regulations, which eximesslv^ircdiibits the granting of rebates. Mr. Webb pointed out that the action proposed would cause no inconvenience to the public as other direct routes existed at rates in no case higher than those of Ra ^ 10 ^ rien ^ h g 01 lister Zf be any financial loss to the Egyptian Government. The Minister ot Communications to whom the matter was submitted, agreed, and on the 14th April the Societe Radio Orient were briefly informed that the Egyptian Administration had taken action under article 33 of the International Telegraph Regulations and had issued instructions to Egyptian Telegraph Offices not to accent telegrams via the routes of the Societe Radio Orient. 263. The French company in Paris immediately sent out a M. Bouthillon to investigate, and M. Cianfarelli, Inspector-General of Posts and Telegraphs, Syria, was sent to Cairo. The former showed a disposition to bluster and thieaten both the Egyptian Administration and Marconis. The latter admitted that Radio Orient had deliberately given rebates and dissociated himself from their action. He also admitted that the Egyptian Government were within their rights m suspending the service, but he pointed out that the suspension would be a grave loss to the Syrian and French Administrations, and he pleaded that a time-limit be set to the suspension. The French Minister supported this plea in notes to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, claiming that under article 33 of the International Telegraph Regulations the Egyptian Government were only entitled to suspend the service temporarily. 264. The British Postmaster-General, who was consulted on this point by the Foreign Office, expressed the opinion that under article 33, if read alone, there was nothing to support the suggestion that the Egyptian Government was under an obligation to announce a time-limit for the suspension. The Secretary of State thereupon informed the High Commissioner that it was a matter for the Egyptian Government to decide, but that, in the light of the Postmaster-General’s observations, he might, if he thought it desirable to do so, inform the Egyptian Government that he supported their action. Meanwhile, however, the Egyptian Government had replied to the French Minister that they regretted they could not comply with his request, and for the moment no further action seemed necessary, especially as the impression existed that the action taken by the French Minister was due more to pressure from the High Commissioner, Syria, than to specific instructions from Paris. Diplomatic Wireless Sets. 265. In October the United States Legation informed the Inspector-General of Telegraphs that the State Department proposed to instal a short-wave receiving set in the Legation to receive news summaries prepared in Washington for the information of representatives of the United States of America abroad, and not tor publication. The Legation stated that no objection had been made to a similar installation m London, and that similar sets had already been installed in the United States Embassies at Rome, Paris and Berlin, and in the consulate at Geneva. 266 . me foreign Omce were consulted, and replied that no spech conditions were imposed on the use of short-wave receiving sets installed t oreign diplomatic missions m London for official purposes, and that paymei of the customary licence fee was not expected in such cases. The Inspector General acwrdmgiy mformed the Legation that there was no objection to S installation of the set for the purposes set forth in the request. Js\ 49 Public Security. , . Although the total number of crimes, delits and contraventions in . uro P eans were conc erned has decreased during the judicial year from 6,268 m 1934 to 5,005 in 1935, there is an increase in the number of murders, which has i isen from seven to ten, and of thefts with violence, which has risen from k c teen to twenty. A substantial decrease, however, is registered in all other categories of crime, and this is specially noticeable in Alexandria. 268. Of the ten murders reported, five occurred in Cairo and Alexandria. These took place either as a result of drunken brawls, insanity or misery and, therefore, cannot be given much importance from a public security point of view. As regards the murders which took place in the provinces, at least two cases—the murders of Nicolas Seratis and Jean Basiliadis—were of the particularly serious nature, i.e., that of the murder of European estate agents. This type of crime is almost always premeditated, generally by some dismissed or disgruntled labourer of the estate, who either hires a professional assassin or commits the murder himself. The failure to obtain convictions in previous cases of this nature has given impetus to the commission of such crimes. In paragraph 276 of his report for 1934 the Director-General of the European Department referred to the measures which were taken by the Ministry of the Interior and the Parquet authorities with a view to improving the state of affairs and of the improvements which resulted. Attempts were also made in the Ministry of Justice with the object of getting the assize courts to show increased severity in cases of murder, but, in so far as European cases are concerned, he cannot yet report any improvement. The delay in hearing cases, the release of murderers on bail of £5 or £10, and perhaps even the lack of goodwill on the part of the judges when trying such cases, continue to be a stumbling-block in the way of improvement. Moreover, as has already been pointed out, the existence of article 17 of the Penal Code, giving wide discretionary powers to judges, constitutes a real danger in cases where the victim is a foreigner, and where passion and prejudice come into play, especially since the Court of Cassion has decreed that judges should be absolved from the necessity of giving reasons for the application of this article. The murder cases of the two Greek overseers (Yassili Panayotti ^ and Elia Athanassopoulo) have ended unsatisfactorily- One case has been filed against an unknown aggressor,” while the accused in the second case have been acquitted, in spite of the fact that the evidence, especially m the latter case, was considered very good by the Administrative and Parquet authoi ities. 269 In June the Greek Minister addressed a note to the Ministry for Foreio-n Affairs drawing attention to the frequent murders of Greek estate agents in the*provinces and to the negligible number of convictions obtained. 270. The total number of crimes throughout the country has increased from 6,860 in 1934 to 7,415 in 1935. 271 Although it was hoped at the beginning of the year that public security woidd imurove a severe check to such improvement was temporarily caused by the tomLSs and moves of mudirs and otkr high officials. The large number of officials an&lt; |^ &gt;m&lt; ^p gpy e y^iJed r ep &lt; eated 0 advice ofThe'Re^idem^ as^regards^death been reported.

He recommended (a) the building of police barracks (“ ezbas ”) on tb~ city outskirts, (b) the inauguration of a pension scheme, and (c) an increase - pay to a figure on which policemen can live without getting into debt. 275 The question of police conditions was taken up by the Director-General, European Department, and the Minister of Finance, Abdel Wahab Pasha, proved responsive and worked out a five-year plan covering buildings &amp;c„ which, though It Sid not meet all the requirements of Russell Pasha, in the opinion of the Director-General, European Department, would result in greatly improved conditions for the police. Students' Political Activities and Strikes. 276. The manner in which the political groups have exploited the turbulent propensities of the student element and the rabble as a means of proclaiming their dissatisfaction with the state of local and Anglo-Egyptian politics has been one of the most disturbing features of the political and social history of Egypt in 1935. The fundamental causes of the students’ unrest which manifested itself from the middle of November onwards are not, however, of an exclusively political order; there has for some time past been a strong undercurrent of discontent among university students owing to the difficulty which they experience in securing posts in the Government service, owing to the meagreness of the salaries offered in that service, and owing to the paucity of openings for young graduates in finance, commerce and industry. It was the university students who formed the nucleus of the agitation described below. 277. There were a number of contributory factors which, in combination, gave the students’ agitation an impetus which threatened to carry them beyond the effective control of the political parties who first instigated the movement against the established authority. In the first place it is to be observed that students are attracted by extremism in politics, and such extremist elements as the Young Egypt Society and the journalist Abbas-al-Akkad, aided by the Liberals, found it an easy matter to turn students against the moderate pro- Nessim policy of the Wafd, who had hitherto held the predominating influence over the student class. These extremist manoeuvres of the Liberals forced the hands of the Wafd, which, to preserve its influence over the students, had itself to display extremism. Sir Samuel Hoare’s references to Egypt in his speech at the Guildhall on the 9th November gave the Wafd the pretext to start on this track and to call for violent demonstrations on the 13th November, the anniversary of Egypt’s demand for independence, thus momentarily rallying the mass of students to the Wafdist banner again. ev -^ ur ^ ermore 5 it is thought that Italian anti-British propaganda in e local pi ess had a certain influence on the students, who are voracious news paper readers. • Xllt3 uibomers may oe ciassined into two categories, viz., those whit preceded the restoration of the 1923 Constitution (the 13th December), which wei - ® n more , seri0 V, s ’ and those which continued afterwards in the name ( ftp f ence ' f . i n ^ ie P 0 ! 1 !' 10 ^! parties incited the students to violence befoi straHn^/nf 1 tn ° f th f Co f stltutlon ’ but th e sporadic and mostly ineffectual demoi narticnlarlv f°u °S t] , on .P eri °d were the work of the Wafd’s opponent been Droved that S ’n ? tani . sts an d Toung Egypt Society.

Students were not infrequently encouraged to riot by their teachers. 4 ^ 281. The main sequence of events may be briefly summarised as follows. 282. On the 13th JNovember a mob of about 2,000 undergraduates armed with sticks, stones and iron bars marched from the university at Giza towards Cairo. Students of other schools and of the Azhar struck work and began demonstrating in other parts of Cairo. Several clashes with the police resulted in injuries to both policemen and demonstrators. The British consulate-general in Cairo was stoned. On the following day nearly all the Government schools in Cairo joined the strike. The university students again marched in a body towards Cairo, but were resisted by the police at the Abbas bridge. A serious affray resulted in injuries to a British police officer, Bimbashi Lees, and a constable, and eventually the police were compelled to open fire in self-defence, with the result that one student was killed on the spot and a number were wounded. During the next few days two more students succumbed to their injuries. In one case an elaborate funeral was attended by all the political leaders and the deceased was buried with all the honours of a national ££ martyr.” 283. Meanwhile, the rabble took advantage of the preoccupations of the police to indulge in orgies of destruction of street lamps, tramcars and motor buses. 284. On the 21st November another serious clash between the students and the police occurred outside the House of the Nation (the Wafd’s headquarters). From the 22nd November to the 6th December the disorders continued in Cairo, but with diminishing severity. The Government had by then taken the precautionary step of closing the university and schools. 285. On the 27th December there was a sharp turn for the worse, and another pitched battle on the Abbas bridge resulted in grave injuries to Miralai Lucas Bey, which happily did not prove fatal. 286. The provinces remained relatively quiet, despite the efforts of Wafdists and university students to incite students of provincial schools to strike in sympathy with the Cairo movement. However, the police were obliged to open fire on demonstrators at Tanta on the 13th November and one student died as a result of injuries received on that occasion. 287. On the 31st December a particularly regrettable disturbance was created at the inauguration of the International Surgery Congress in the University Hall. Thousands of students met the delegates with shouts for independence and ££ Down with England!” Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha and Sidky Pasha received ovations, while Nahas Pasha, who tried to urge the students to disperse was howled down. The Prime Minister was unable even to enter the building. The disturbance continued throughout the opening ceremony inside the hall. 288. The attitudes of the parquet and the tribunals towards the students were deplorable. The former, in its examination of incidents arising out of the disorders displayed an unfair and critical spirit towards the police, and thus encouraged the forces of disorder. A similar effect was produced by the inadequate sentences imposed by the tribunals. In one case the judge of the Abdin court who tried students on the 18th November actually commended students for displaying their patriotic feelings m vunent fashion, and excused their attacks on the police on the ground that they were provoked by the affiressiyftaken by the police. This judge also questxoned, m a contemptuous manner, the accuracy of evidence submitted by the police. 9RQ Tt is at least satisfactory to record that the Government remained JU ae ainst the repeated insistence of the students and certain politicians that an Amnesty shouldte granted to those who had been convicted on charges of riotous conduct. 2290. The statistics of casualties in the demonstrations up to e end o December are as follows Police force: Total number injured ™ Demonstrators— 5 Total number dead ... ••• Total number injured Members of public : Total number injured 13 291 The agitation had not quietened down by the end of the year, but the schools and univirsity were reopened on the 30th December and remained open, although student strikes and disorders continued for a few weeks longer. The influence of the Wafd after the issue of the decree re-establishing t e 9 3 Constitution was strongly exercised in the direction of preventing such student strikes and disorders. This influence was eventually successful against the • -i. mrvn Wafriist, nart,ifiS Young Egypt Society. 292. In April there were signs of renewed activity on the part of the Young Egypt Society. Its president, Ahmed Hussein, returned from his pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina boasting of energetic anti-imperialist propaganda activities among foreign Moslems and claiming to have enlisted the sympathy of King Ibn Sand. 293. The society was known to have enjoyed covert support of the palace; the chief of the Royal Cabinet was reported to have contributed substantially to its funds. Strangely enough, it was also reported to have received some financial support from an opposite quarter, i.e., from Abbas Halim, towards the expenses incurred in publishing the newspaper Wadinnil, which the society temporarily adopted as its organ after its weekly paper Sarkha had been suppressed for indulging in anti-British propaganda. The Society seemed to be angling for a working alliance with Abbas Halim’s labour movement. 294. The society’s activities received further impetus and advertisement in August when it professed to take up an actively pro-Abyssinian attitude, evidently hoping to rise on the wave of Egyptian sympathy for the cause of Abyssinia. In November, however, Ahmed Hussein seemed to have become converted to the principle of Egyptian neutrality after receiving, according to police reports, a sum of money from the local Italian propaganda agency to assist him in reviving the defunct Sarkha. The Italians were also able to play on his anti-British feelings at the same time, and were stated to have contributed £500 towards the expenses of the anti-British propaganda tour in London, Paris and Geneva which the society’s president and secretary began early in December. The society also collected £217 from their Egyptian supporters and sympathisers for this tour, the main object of which was to impress influential circles abroad with the alleged iniquity of Great Britain’s policy in Egypt. 295. Simultaneously with the foregoing activities, the society expended considerable energy in printing and distributing circulars calling for the boycotting of foreign, and more particularly British, goods. Drugs. 296. There are no recent statistics which throw any light upon the extent o t _e importation of narcotics during the year. The Narcotics Bureau, however, are satisfied that the amount which reached Egypt was comparatively small. It is clear however that any premature relaxation of precautions would lead to a le uin q , e deplorable conditions of a few years ago. Thanks to the co-operaiKm of the French authorities in Syria, the importation of hashish from that territory has been .almost stamped out.

It was true, he added, that Egypt had a reserve ot some tdO million, but the greater part of this reserve was by no means liouid and m no circumstances would it be available for a very long time to come. 298. The draft law, which will need the assent of the Powers, has not yet been produced. Egyptian Army. 299. General .—El Lewa Mohammed Tewfik Abdulla Pasha held the post of Minister of War and Marine throughout the year. He took a greater interest in the training and the administration of the army than any of his predecessors. This was doubtless due to his previous service as an army officer. He was interested in the education of the young Egyptian officers and anxious to take advantage of any opportunity of sending them on educational missions to England. He was, however, difficult and obstinate in regard to His Majesty’s Government’s proposals for the modernisation of the Egyptian army in so far as they provided for an increase in the number of British officers in an instructional capacity. 300. Modernisation Proposals .—The question of His Majesty’s Govern ment’s future policy towards the development of the Egyptian army and the Egyptian army air force continued to engage the attention of the home depart ments concerned. The Foreign Office agreed that the programme put forward by the Minister for War, and referred to in last year’s report, for an increase in the Egyptian army, should be held up pending a decision on the general question. The High Commissioner informed the Prime Minister accordingly, and Nessim Pasha agreed that the increase should not be proceeded with. 301. The Frontiers Administration budget proposals, however, when they appeared, were found to contain a provision for an increase of two light car patrol sections and one camel corps section, the former each armed with two Vickers machine guns. On consulting the Inspector-General, Egyptian army, it appeared that this provision was to take the place of the five light car patrols without machine guns and two camel corps sections approved last year but never raised. General Spinks gave it as his opinion that full advantage had not been taken of His Majesty’s Government’s agreement to the larger increase in order to side-track the restoration of a British second-in-command of the Camel Corps which had been proposed last year in connexion with our acceptance of the increases. After consulting the General Officer Commanding, howe\ei, it Wdo intimated to the Minister of War that no objection would be raised to the supply of machine guns provided the above-mentioned restoration were carried out. After some procrastination on the part of the Egyptian authoi ities, this appoint ment was eventually made. By the middle of the summer it had become apparent that an additional British officer attached to the Frontiers Administration forces was urgently needed for intelligence work in the Western Desert. The matter was put to the Minister of War and subsequently to the Prime Minister. It was intimated that in the event of this appointment being agreed to, no objection could be raised on the part of His Majesty’s Government to an increase of four additional machine guns for the two light car patrol sections laised m 1929 and 1931 This offer was eventually accepted, and a British officer Captain Kennett, was appointed, who carried out valuable intelligence work in the Western Desert. 302. In the meantime, the question of the extent to which, in the event of the Cabinet deciding in favour of a policy whereby the Egyptian army shouk abandon its present role of providing for internal security m favour of active O o ooeration with His Majesty’s forces, modern weapons should be supplied to it, and P what conditions should be attached thereto, had been engaging the active consideration of the Residency, the local British military authorities and the [13399] E' 54 w His Maiestv’s Government had already decided that in future only 3rTing*fficer?sholld be recommended for attachment to the Egyptian army with limited periods of service. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who paid a virit to Egypt in the spring, also put forward a tentative scheme for the modernisation of the Egyptian army '^AVnlmnTrmyTh^be i^Xi the number of British officers serving with the Egyptian arm} snouid be increases; so as to provide additional British officers on headquarters staffs, and British officer advisers with each infantry battalion, and with cavalry, signals, ordnance and supply and transport. 303. With the development of international events in the summer and the employment of Egyptian troops in the Western Desert, demands began to be raised afresh in Egyptian circles for the creation of an efficient modern army On his return from leave at the end of September the High Commissioner sounded King Fuad and the Prime Minister as to the possibility of increasing the number of British officers in return for modernisation and found them sympathetic. JVftei consulting the General Officer Commanding, the Air Officer Commanding and the Inspector 0 General, Egyptian army, he therefore informed the Foreign Office that the moment seemed to be propitious for introducing proposals of this nature, and requested authority to go ahead with the scheme. Authority was duly received, and, after consultation between the General Officer Commanding and the War Office, concrete proposals were agreed to which provided briefly for the allotment of four Vickers guns and sixteen light automatic guns to each Egyptian battalion, an increase of sixteen British officers and fourteen n.c.os., combined training of the British and Egyptian forces, additional opportunities for contacts between the members of the' two forces and certain other measures for increasing the efficiency of the Egyptian army. The Prime Minister accepted the proposals without demur, and suggested that they should be discussed in detail between the Minister of War, the Inspector-General of the Egyptian army and the General Officer Commanding. The former, however, at once adopted a hostile attitude towards the suggestion of increasing the number of British officers, and submitted counter-proposals for an increase of three officers and two n.c.os. for instructional purposes in the new weapons as a purely temporary measure. It seemed possible that pressure from the King and the Prime Minister would eventually have led to Tewfik Abdulla Pasha abandoning this attitude, but by then the internal political crisis had supervened, and it was clearly impossible to bring any pressure to bear with a view to the acceptance of the proposals for the time being. It should be recorded that the Inspector-General of the Egyptian army himself, although he had accepted the proposals as modified to meet his views, had proved himself by no means a warm advocate of the proposed increase of British officers, which he had considered would meet with strong resistance, and which, in his opinion, were unnecessary and would not provide the safeguards His Majesty’s Government desired. Air Force. 304 The strength in aircraft of the Egyptian armv air force, consisting of r n „ y g eneral P ur P°se Avros, six de Havilland training Moths and one Westland Wessex eight-seater transport aeroplane, remained unchanged during e year. Orders have been placed for one Avro 652 transport aeroplane due for vritEpIntfeE™^ 193 n 6 ’ n nd f ° r S1X ^' dax general purpose aeroplanes fitted with Panther engines which are expected in Egypt about July next.

As eanly as J une it was evident that there was unusual activity across the frontier and Irom that time the situation was watched and intelligence reports were furnished. It should be observed that the way in which the British army and air force, m concert with the Egyptian army and Frontiers Administration forces were able to make the dispositions necessary for defence was to a large extent only possible owing to the fact that the Frontiers Administration is for effective purposes still under British control. 310. The military measures which have been taken in the Western Desert have made it necessary to introduce successive steps to tighten up control on the western frontier and to prevent access of Italian agents and other unauthorised persons to areas of military interest. This task was greatly complicated by the existence of the Italian vice-consulate at Solium, which naturally maintained the closest contact with the authorities in Libya and which formed a centre for Italian intelligence work and propaganda among the local Bedouins. Consideration was given to the possibility of securing the removal of the vice-consulate, but by the end of the year no satisfactory means of effecting this had been found. Steps were taken in September, however, to introduce effective control of travellers arriving at Solium, and at the same time a prohibited zone for aircraft was introduced covering a belt roughly 20 miles deep along the coast from Solium to Alexandria. Subsequently, the military and air authorities urged the desirability of establishing a general prohibited zone in the Western Desert, and on the 18th November an order was issued by the Frontiers Administration declaring the whole north-western portion of the Western Desert Province, with the exception of a small strip round Solium itself, so as to exclude the Italian vice- consul and his staff, a prohibited area. Permits are required for residence and admission, the latter only to be granted to persons travelling on Egyptian or British Government business. 311. Early in October three Abyssinian-born deserters from the Italian forces in Libya crossed the frontier, and gave themselves up to the Frontiers Administration authorities. In the middle of December four white Italian deserters of Yugoslav race also crossed the frontier into the prohibited area. In both cases the Italian authorities demanded their return under an existing agreement with the Egyptian Government for the reciprocal return of deserters. After consulting the Foreign Office, the Egyptian authorities concerned were advised that the Egyptian Government were at liberty at any time to discontinue the practice approved by the above-mentioned agreement, with no other consequence than the loss of the reciprocal advantage thereby obtained, and that such discontinuance was justified and, in fact, might be considered obligatory under the international rules applicable to neutrals now that Italy was in a state of war. The Italian authorities were informed accordingly. 312. In response to requests of the military authorities, the Egyptian Government granted credits for the construction of several stretches of first-class roads in the Western Desert, e.g., from Cairo to Alexandria via Amria and from Euka the railhead of the railway to Alexandria, to Mersa Matruh and Sidi Barrani. The construction of a temporary railway between Fuka and Mersa Matruh was also begun. The water supply at Mersa Matruh has been developed, and these various schemes have provided much needed work for the Bedouin whom a continued succession of rainless winters had reduced to a state bordering on starvation. In spite of the relief thus afforded however, prospects for the future are not good, for again there has been a complete absence of i am in such quantities as are required to enable seed to be sown, and seed issued was mostly consumed instead of being sown. [13399] E 456 &lt; * 0 1 j n f TCrm^pir in th.6 Red Sen district, 313. A disturbing situation was revea ^ e number of Italian employees, where the Italian Phosphate P^P^iHu ally un3er Italian control, the company have their headquarters.

Concern was a so felt X g ^ etr 5( P and oi i requirements of the at Hurghada, which supplies the bulk oi the p were made which British naval, military and air forces in Egypt. Arrangeme t remained somewhat unsatisfactory. 314 Owing to the concentration of attention and personnel on the es f® r ^ Desert there has* inevitably been a slackening of the anti-contraband work which normally forms one of the major preoccupations of the Administration. Though some seizures are still being made, it would be surprising if more drugs were not coming through than usual. The price of hashish is generally a fairly reliable guide to the amount available, and this has not yet shown any marked a . 315. In last year’s report reference was made to a proposal to increase the strength of the camel corps by five car patrols and two camel sections. 1 he final decision was to limit the increase to two car patrols and one camel section, these T.cOoorl cinrl tminprl ffiiHnp- the vear under review. 316. In the course of the year El Lewa Ahmed Shafik Pasha, the first Egyptian Director-General of the Frontiers Administration, retired on pension. Shafik Pasha’s willingness to work amicably with his British officials and, indeed, to allow them to take almost full control was a great asset to the^ Administration. He has been succeeded by El Lewa Mohammed Fewfik Pasha. 1 he new director- general is somewhat of the same type, but reputed to be obstinate, and it is too early to say whether things will continue to go on as smoothly as they did under Shafik Pasha. 317. The post of second-in-command of the camel corps was recreated and filled by the promotion of the British Bimbashi. Two new British Bimbashi’s were also engaged, so that there are now four British officers with the camel corps. 318. Some progress has been made towards solving the problem of the recruitment of staff for the administrative posts referred to in last year’s report. The Minister of War has proposed to transform the cadre of the administrative side of the Administration to a military one and to fill all future vacancies by seconding officers from the Egyptian army. The proposal is still in its infancy. It will involve some additional expense and the financial authorities have not yet been consulted, but there seems to be nothing inherently workable in the scheme. 319. The High Commissioner paid a visit by air in June to the oases of Baharia in the Western Desert Province and Farafra, Dakhla and Kharga in the Southern Desert Province. Certain urgent needs on the part of the inhabitants in regard to such matters as schools, wells and communications were brought to his attention, and as a result of his subsequent intervention something had already been done by the end of the year to remedy these matters.Civil Flying. 320.

Government Subsidy to the Company .—The experience of the company clearly showed that the proposed grant-in-aid to the company in accordance with the provisional authorisation given to the company in 1932, namely, a sum equal to 50 per cent, of the amount allocated in each year for obsolescence, insurance and depreciation and not exceeding £E. 5,000 in any one year, was totally inadequate to enable the company to surmount the initial difficulties of establishing regular air services. 322. The Egyptian Government, after due consideration ^of proposals submitted by the Director-General of Aviation, agreed in June 1935 to grant the company a subsidy calculated on the basis of these proposals amounting to ( per cent, of the operating costs of each approved service. 323. The subsidy is granted for five years from the date of the commence ment of operation of regular air lines, viz., August 1933. At the expiration cr the first five years this form of subsidy will be reconsidered m the light of experience gained. 324.

With effect irom the 12th June, 1935, the K.L.M. commenced to operate its Holland-Batavia air service twice weekly. 327. The negotiations which were in progress during the year 1934 with a view to the extension of an Italian air service Tobruk-Bengazi to Alexandria resulted in 1935 in the grant of a provisional authorisation by the Egyptian Government to the nominated Italian air transport £ £ Ala Littoria 5 ’ company. 328. The company commenced the operation of this service in September 1935. With effect from the 4th December, 1935, the company extended its service to Asmara (via Wadi Haifa), operating twice weekly. 329. Private and Sports Flying. —The National Aero Club of Egypt, as the only authorised authority in this country to issue ££ Carnets de passage en Douane,’ 5 has issued during the period under review ten Carnets. The club has published the general rules of the third international Egyptian aviation meeting which it has been decided to organise in March 1936. The contest consists of a set course of approximately 1,300 miles. During the year under review the Egyptian Government has granted the Aero Club of Egypt £E. 600 to enable it to provide the initial equipment, the purchase of gliders, and means for catapulting and launching. 330.

Air Port Development. —During the year under review a hangar (52 m x 62-5 m. x 12 m.) capable of housing large-span land aeroplanes and liying-boats has been constructed at Alexandria Airport (Dekheila). 333. During 1935 the question of proceeding with the permanent administrative control buildings at Dekheila, provided with all facilities for the efficient control of traffic and passengers and the carrying out of the necessary clearance formalities, has been under consideration. Agreement has been reached as to the lay-out of the building and accommodation required by the various State Departments and air transport operating companies. 334. The necessary credit has been included in the Aviation Department’s budgetary proposals for the year 1936-37. 335. The foundations for runways comprising an area of 200,000 square metres were completed during the year 1935. These foundations are at present being covered with bituminous macadam surfacing to provide seven runways which will be adequate for all types of aircraft to land and take off in all directions of wind. 336. Concrete aprons, measuring 3,000 square metres each, have been constructed during the year under review at each entrance to the hangar referred to above. 337. For facilitating night landing a Neon aerodrome beacon has been constructed. The beacon consists of thirty-two tubes each of 3 metres long. Four tubes are arranged on each of the eight legs of the tower constructed in steel to form two parallel lengths 6 metres long each on each leg. The sixteen lengths of 6 metres are connected to six oil immersed self-cooling transformers. This beacon is now in operation. 338. A complete boundary lighting system, comprising forty-two illuminated white cylinders with an orange glass top, spaced at 7o metres interval around the periphery of the landing area has now been installed. 339. A velocity indicator has been erected comprising a cone arranged to be incandescently illuminated in a different colour for each wind velocity as follows :— M. p. h. 0-5 white. - 5-10 orange 10-15 green. 15-20 blue. 20-25 red. Its operation is automatic. 340. An illuminated “ T ” velocity indicator, is electrically flood light has been installed. wind director indicator, erected adjacent to the illuminated at night, and a “third order” chanceo i -i boundary lights and the flood lights ai e not jet actually in operation, LwtThopld legotiations for the supply of electnc current wrll be completed in January 1936. uao Harbour Works.—During 1935 the necessary research work was ufdertaS m ofder to proceed with the construction of the manne arrpor harbour and the outer breakwater. 343 The developments completed on the landplane side of the airport now make it possible to concentrate on those for seaplane operations. The necessary ™d?ts fo P r the construction of the seaplane harbour and to comme^ of the outer breakwater have been included in the budget pioposais toi year 1936-37. 344. Luxor Aerodrome.-During the year under review a suitable site for the construction of a State aerodrome at Luxor was selected. Most of the land required is Government property, the additional area is being secured by exoronriation In 1936 the necessary levelling and constructional work will be undertakenand, when completed, Luxor will be designated the Southern State airport of Egypt. 345. El-A rish A irport. —During the year 1935 a hangar 30 metres by 25 metres by 5-25 metres was constructed. An asphaltic mix-in place tarmac measuring 5,620 square metres was also constructed. 346. The completion of a Neon aerodrome beacon at this airport, during the year under review which it was intended to operate from a portable electric generating supply set, has been deferred pending completion of arrangements to supply current to the aerodrome from the electric power station which is being provided at El-Arish town. 347. It is hoped that during the financial year 1936-37 El-Arish airport will be fitted with electric flood lighting equipment to provide safe landing facilities at night in view of the increased air traffic and developments in connexion with the proposal for all first-class Egyptian mail to be carried by air. 348. Mersa-Matruh Airport. —A bitumen macadam tarmac measuring 6,195 square metres was constructed during 1935. 349. The use of Mersa Matruh as Egypt’s western border airport has been temporarily abandoned since October 1935, and all aircraft crossing the western frontier are at present required to land at Solium. 350. Credit for the provision of portable flood lighting equipment has been included in the Aviation Department’s budget proposals for 1936-37. 351. Airways and Air Route Beacon. —In 1935 the work in connexion with the supply and erection of an adjustable course indicating beacon at Kantara has been put in hand. The beacon is intended to indicate to night-flying pilots the authorised route to be followed across the prohibited area of the Suez Canal Zone. It is anticipated that the beacon will be in operation early in May 1936. 352. Meteorological Services. —Meteorological stations have been provided at Almaza and Dekheila airports. They were likewise provided with the necessary equipment for making balloon observations of upper winds. 353. During the financial year 1936-37 meteorological stations will be provided at Mersa Matruh and El-Arish. 354. Wireless Services.—An Aeradio station has been established at Mersa Matruh. The station was opened on the 11 th February, 1935, to deal exclusively with the air navigation traffic. The construction of three direction-finding stations in Egypt is in hand, viz., Mersa Matruh, Dekheila and Dekhla or Luxor. 4 35 i 5 ' decided t0 erec t a direction-finding station at Dekheila instead ot El-Arish as originally proposed. After conclusion of wireless tele- graphy tests during the next few months it is hoped to determine whether it will be possible to establish the southern wireless telegraphy and direction-finding station at Luxor rather than Dekhla. 561 356. Air Navigation Laws and Regulations following legislation was enacted •—On the 27th May, 1935, the W ^ aw decree on Egyptian air navigation (2) Decree regulating air navigation. ^gyftian Air Law. 357. In March Bedawi Pasha enquired of the judicial adviser whether there was any objection to proceeding with the Egyptian Air Law on the basis proposed last teai - and accepted by His Majesty’s Government. He was informed that the rfhl oTh r™ U T S l y giVen StiU held g° 0d ’ and the law wa s accordingly issued of a decree the^ame day' naVlgatl0n regulatlons were Promulgated in the form Italian Air Services. 358. Under the terms of a convention signed between His Maiesty’s in United Kingdom and the Italian Government on the 7th December, 1934, His Majesty s Government agreed to allow the operation of an Italian air service across the Sudan and certain British colonial possessions. In an exchange of letters between the British and Italian Directors of Civil Aviation, His Majesty s Government also undertook to support the representa tions of the Italian Government to the Egyptian Government with a view to the operation of a service over Egyptian territory. On the 18th January the Italian Government formally informed His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome of their desire to run an air service (the Ala Littoria Company) from Rome to Mogadiscio via Alexandria, Assiout, Wadi Haifa or Halaba—Port Sudan-Massawa—Jibuti- Berbera-Obtra, and requested that the Sudan Government should be notified. They also stated that the Egyptian Government were being approached in regard to that part of the route which lay over Egyptian territory, and requested His Majesty’s Government’s support. The Sudan Government agreed to the proposal in principle, but expressed a preference for the route Wadi-Halfa-Atbara- Kassala-Asmara. On the 26th February the Italian Government informed Sir Eric Drummond that they had decided as a provisional measure to use Imperial Airways as far as Khartum, connecting there with Ala Littoria, which would run via Kassala-Asmara-Massawa. The Sudan Government agreed, but laid down {a) that Khartum must not be the permanent terminus and (5) that landings must be made at Kassala on exit and entry. 359. In the meantime the Egyptian Government had concluded a provisional agreement with the Italian Government for a service from Benghazi to Alexandria. Authorisation was given for six months to start with the arrival of the first machine and renewable for further periods of six months until a permanent convention was concluded. 360. In April the Italian authorities requested authorisation to extend the service from Alexandria to the Sudan to link up with the existing Ala Littoria service. The Egyptian Government agreed subject to the same conditions as the above. The Sudan Government and His Majesty’s Government also agreed and the Italian Government were informed accordingly, but with the proviso that the route followed should be Wadi Halfa-Atbara-Kassala with a compulsory landing at Wadi Haifa. In the event the through service was not put into operation until the end of the year, the Khartum— Kassala—Asmara service, however, having been functioning bi-weekly from the middle of the summei and the Benghazi Alexandria service from the beginning of September. 361. The military measures which it was found necessary to take in the Western Desert towards the end of September compelled the Residency to ask the Egyptian authorities to take certain steps to control the movements of Ala Littoria aircraft. The civil aerodrome at Mersa Matmh was taken over by the military authorities, and the military aerodrome at Solium became the first port of landing Steps were taken to prohibit all photography from the air, both Fn pivot and the Sudan. On the 20th October a prohibited zone for aircraft was declared over the area lying between Solium “fUnito 1 pallov^raTflw belt of roughly 20 miles inland, aircraft being routed so as to pass over as points of military importance as possible At e “ d . f 9°^^^ Government announced their intention of starting a special air mail service no62 Alexandria to Kassala, using I ^' al g^to^perate the Benghazi Asmara service for passengers.

Airways wireless detectors and th. us Z^duce^he risksj)f an rtherwme 362 Several instances occurred of violations of the prohibited zone in the Western Desert by Ala Littoria aircraft. The most flagrant case occurred on the 12th December, when an Ala Littoria machine, supposed to be landing at Solium, flew over 100 miles into the prohibited zone until within 28 miles of Mersa Matruh, flew low over a British mechanised column, and turned back towards the frontier, eventually making a forced landing, through lack of petrol, 18 miles east of Solium. Protests were made to the Italian Legation by the Egyptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs on each occasion, and, m the case referred to above, the Legation were warned that the recurrence of such persistent violation of the regulations could not fail to have unfortunate reactions on the relations of the Ala Littoria Company with the Egyptian Government. 363. Although the vast majority of Italian aircraft intended for service in East Africa were shipped by sea, the preparatory military measures of the Italian Government led to a considerable increase in the number of Italian military flights over Egypt and the Sudan. Early in the year the Italian Legation applied to the Eesidency and the Egyptian Government for a ‘ £ blanket ’ ’ permission for flights of military units, notifications of details merely being given when the time came. After consulting the Foreign Office and the Sudan Government, this request was refused, and advice in this sense was given to the Egyptian authorities. Requests were also received from the Legation for the waiver of the requirement in the Sudan regulations that landings should be made at Wadi Haifa and Kassala in the case of certain flights from Libya to Eritrea. This was agreed to in the case of two flights of junior Italian Ministers, but the maintenance of this condition was insisted upon in the case of ordinary flights. By the middle of the summer it was found that inconvenience and confusion was being caused by the failure of the Legation to give adequate notice when applying for permission to fly across Egypt and the Sudan, more particularly in view of the necessity for referring all applications for permission for military flights to the Air Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, Middle East. In one or two cases the machines actually arrived in Egypt and the Sudan before permission had been granted. It was felt that, in view of the Italo-Abyssinian situation, it was essential to have a watertight procedure in regard to such flights, and the Residency therefore suggested to the Egyptian and Sudan Governments that a minimum of seven days notice should be insisted upon. This proposal was accepted, and the further condition that permission should only be valid for seven days as from the date of the flight was also adopted. Representations were made to the Italian Government on the subject by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome and, informally, by the Residency to the Legation. At the same time the Egyptian Government issued a general circular to foreign missions in a similar sense. As a result of the fatal accident to the Italian &gt;8.81 on the 7th August, stricter conditions were laid down in regard to the route to be followed by mi itary aircraft passing over Sudan territory, and to the provision of wireless equipment, fhe above-mentioned accident, which took place in the desert not far ^ 01 f&gt; 1 Cair0 f lG r ^ barges on the part of the local Italian community of sabotage on the part of the British or Egyptian authorities.

The opportunity was accordingly taken by the High Commissioner of a request from the Prime Minister for the assistance of the British military and air authorities with a view to diminishing the risk of bombing to the existing water reservoirs to hand Tewfik Nessim Pasha, on the 10th July, an aide-memoire emphasising the importance of the Residency and the military and air authorities knowing in advance of proposed flights by military aircraft of foreign Powers. It was suggested that the simplest procedure would be for the Egyptian Government to consult the Residency before giving permission for flights for which application had been received through the diplomatic channel. The Prime Minister replied on the 24th July with an aide-memoire, which said that the Residency had always been notified of such flights, and suggested that, in effect, permission was not given without Residency approval. This reply was considered satisfactory, and, indeed, during the rest of the summer, when Italian military flights became fairly numerous, the Egyptian Acting Director-General of Civil Aviation was in constant touch with the Residency about military flights and took no step without their full approval. Notes from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs announcing applications for military flights were acknowledged with the statement that the British air and military authorities had been consulted and entertained no objections to the grant of permission. Labour Developments. 366. A report issued by the Labour Office in October shows the work accomplished by the Labour Office during the first five years of its existence and outlines a programme of future legislation and administrative policy. 367. During most of 1935 there has been an abnormal amount of unrest among the workers of Egypt. The causes of agitation are various, but it should not be assumed that the grievances of labour are now more acute than in the past. The reverse is actually the case if a comparison is made with the lates or pay and extent of unemployment during the past four years, but improving con i ions are in themselves often a cause of unrest. 368. One of the principal factors of agitation during the current year was the so-called Federation of Trade Unions created and directed by the ex-JNabil Abbas Halim. The association more closely resembles a universal syndicate than a confederation of syndicates. It absorbs 40 per cent, of the subscriptions to the affiliated unions and intervenes directly m trade disputes as well, it wou appear, as fomenting disagreements with a view 0 ^ ® 1V ® S ter a time Originally, Abbas Halim was more or less an ally e ’ p ,i Wafd as his influence in the labour world increased, he dnf e aw&lt; &gt; i .ftunatelv and played with the idea of founding a political labour .Ufilers S Abbas Halim is surrounded by a band of professiona syndicalists lawyers ^ laymen, most of whom can be counted on ‘j® w it Ly safely be said bad faith whenever a crisis occurs. Still, m a ge R • , y t p r0 ved so that the Federation of Trade Unions owing allegiance to him has not pro64 agitation. Hprided to put the labour 369. Shortly after the Wafdist ^^ 1 |[ eSS The mo ti V es of this action were movement under the contro o ® , , 0 ^ ta j n ^ allegiance of the working twofold : it was desired, m brilliance of Abbas Halim, who has tre^sur^f th/fetTa^ftude and quite independent of the orbit of the ^370. A Labour Council was simultaneously ‘with'the* efforts of the Halim Federation has sometrmes made confusion worse confounded. 371. It may be said that up to now the Wafd orTanisa and obtain political support for the Wafd party. 372 It is obviously wrong in a country so little developed as Egypt that t e destinies of trade unions should be entrusted to the protection of a pohtica party, and if and when a law governing unions is made, the affiliation of unio to political parties will be strictly forbidden. 373 A not uncommon feature of the strikes which have taken place during 1935 has been the absence of any statement of grievances by the men. Workers have abandoned their work at tbe instigation of muddle-headed leaders who have persuaded them that the mere existence of a lederation of Syndicates would secure for them more pay and shorter hours. Conciliators delegated by the Labour Office have had to find out if, in fact, grievances existed, and have usually insisted in such cases on the men returning to work before examining tiie situation. 374. Apart from the attempts made by the delegates of the Halim and Wafdist federations to agitate workers with the sole object of showing their own strength, there have been definite and intelligible causes for many of the strikes which have occurred during 1935. The most characteristic of these were (a) dissatisfaction at low wages at a time when ^employment was becoming- plentiful and rates of wages for unskilled labour had risen, and (b) the failure of labour contractors to fulfil their obligations towards the men. 375. The transfer of the Labour Office to the Ministry of Commerce was effected in the autumn by a decision of the Council of Ministers. This change is greatly to the benefit of the office for a number of obvious reasons, and more especially because it severs in a complete manner the official connexion with the police, which for a long time deterred workers and workers’ leaders from taking the office into their confidence. 376. It is proposed that the Labour Office shall be called the Department of Labour and be presided over by a Director-General. 377. The progress of legislation continues to be very slow, but it is nevertheless perceptible. A law limiting the hours of work to nine in certain dangerous and unhealthy occupations was promulgated in November. The Workmen’s Compensation Act has passed the Comite consultatif de Legislation, where it underwent certain modifications in form, but preserved nine-tenths of its essential characteristics. It should be examined by the Mixed Courts early in 1936. 378. The newly-constituted Higher Labour Council, where new labour legislation is debated, has met frequently since the summer recess and the standard of debate has improved. On the whole, it may be said that the institution of the council at Mr. H. B. Butler’s suggestion has been a success. It piovides the necessary variety of experience for the preparation of practical laws, and it gives non-official citizens of the country an opportunity to shape their own destinies in conjunction with officials from whom they have something to learn and to whom they have a good deal to teach.[13399] i&amp;v The Copts. 379. The problem of religious instruction for Coptic pupils in elementary schools continued to form the suoject of discussion at intervals during the year Neguib-el-Hilaly Bey was disposed to be sympathetic and, although unable to agree to all the proposals made by the Coptic Patriarch in 1934 (see paragraph 373 of annual report for 1934), was prepared to make certain concessions which were an advance on the previous position. He offered for instance, to make a financial grant to the Copts to assist them to organise their own religious instruction and to make religious education obligatory for Copts as for Moslem pupils. He further reduced the number of hours devoted to religious teaching in these schools. He was unable, however, to concede to the Coptic demand that Christian religious instruction should be given within the schools, or that the Government should undertake to provide Coptic religious teachers and generally organise Christian religious instruction in the elementary schools. 380. These proposals were under consideration by the Copts at the end of the year. Greek Orthodox Community. 381. The death of Meletios II, Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria on the 28th July, brought to a head the controversy between the Greek and Syrian elements in the Greek Orthodox Community. The regulations drawn up by Meletios in June 1934 for the conduct of the affairs of the Patriarchate, including patriarchal elections, had not, up to the time of Meletios’ death, received the approval of the Egyptian Government. It will be remembered that these regulations were not acceptable to the Syrians. The latter now strenuously opposed, and the Greek majority equally strenuously demanded the application of these regulations for the election of Meletios’ successor. 382. After considerable discussion it was decided that the elections should proceed on the basis of the 1934 Peglement, but that as soon as possible after the election of the new Patriarch a new Organic Law, satisfactory to both parties, should be drawn up. The elections were accordingly begun on this understanding, and appeared to be working out in favour of a nominee of the Greek majority when the Syrians, supported by some of the Greek clergy, who were dissatisfied with the result of the primary elections, prevailed upon the P rim e Munster ^ suspend the elections pending the elaboration of a reglement h their demands not only in electoral matters, but in the number ^ Syrian bmhops and in Syrian participation in the control of Church funds. Suspension of th elections on these conditions meant their postponement “ ^efimte date and was most undesirable in view of the urgent necessity for the appointment ot a ne Patriarch. 383 Further representations were therefore made to Pivernmellt ment, and at the end of the year the position wa J th ^ had authorised the resumption of the elections on th n e n c ° n ^ X reasonable Syrian elect should produce a new Organic Law which wouW satisfy reawnaWe byna demands before he was accorded official recognition by the Egyptian Oovernmen 384. It was expected that the elections would be resumed early in the New Year. 385. Ever since the opening of the “^“^eT to a drastifreduction^f had been unrest in the Azhar due, among au( j to t ( ie introduction of allowances to the higher students an ^ ’ e to allowed to pass from regulations limiting the number of stude t h studentSj supported by a number the lower to the upper sections A resignation of the Rector, Sheikh-al- of dismissed teachers, demanded f SO r Sheikh-al-Maraghi, a pro- Zawahiri, and the appointment of hm P, ; eform 0 f the Azhar, which gressive and enlightened man wi ,, 1 reauirements of a modernised Egypt.

There was now the danger that the A^ar. 9 of ant i GoV ernment might be won over by the Wafd and become propaganda. f66 386. On the 24th March a ^ous conflict occurred^tetwe^n t^uden^ and the teachers, one of whom was ser ■' „La en t s a number of whom were enter the sacred precincts and to dls Pff e ^ousedmuch adwse criticism by its injured.

S87 Subseauently as a result of fresh developments m the political situation the King was’induced to agree to the retirement of Zawahm and t e appointment of Sheikh A1 Maraghi on the 27th April. Finally the 6t \^ h a J’ the Azhar and dependent provincial institutions were reopened, and the Azhar ffigh Council reinstated the Ulema and students who had been dismissed on account of the strike, and brought back to their former posts the professors and teachers who had been transferred. Legal Status of Members of His Majesty's Forces. 388. During the year the question of the subjection of members of His Majesty’s Forces in Egypt to the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts was again raised. The immunity enjoyed may be waived by the High Commissioner after consultation with the General Officer Commanding. In cases where there is a difference of opinion the question is referred to the Secretary of State. 389. The question which has now been raised is whether military personnel are immune from process in normal times when they are sued in a purely private character, as distinct from a representative character where the funds or responsibility of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom might be engaged. 390. The Acting Judicial Adviser is of opinion that the immunity given to members of the Army of Occupation is, and has generally been, recognised as being based entirely on the exigencies of the service, and both he and the Judicial Adviser feel that it is unfair to the plaintiff that the question of waiver should be decided, as the military authorities suggested, as the result of an ex parte preliminary investigation by the military authorities. They point out, moreover, that such preliminary trial would prejudice members of the forces in cases where immunity is waived. 391. The matter has been referred to the Secretary of State. Quarantine Board. 392. The statement of accounts of the International Quarantine Board shows that during the financial year ended the 30th April, 1935, receipts totalled £E. 110,772-317 milliemes, and expenditure £E. 103,812-654 milliemes. Receipts were £E. 2,000 less than in the previous year, which was due to a decision to exempt vessels passing through the Suez Canal in certain circumstances from the double quarantine operation at Suez and Port Said. The number of vessels which benefited by the new decision was 3,739. t eight months of 1935 £E. 37,795 was collected in fees, towards this total British shipping contributed £E. 13,183.

For one thine Nessim Pasha himselt exasperated and antagonised the whole body of journalists by his persistent unwillingness to take them into his confidence or to impart to them even the most anodyne information with regard to the Government’s P policy His silence soon became proverbial, a subject of bitter caricature and a grievance It vear e but a the e Wafdi f SUPP ° rt ° f ^ af ^ St P reSS for the part of the year, but the Wafdist organs were as loud as any of their contemporaries in to n be e avoi n fed hl fl S t tr Ti atme i nt 0 Tn he P i reS? aS a 1 bu g bear . wbos e importunities were to be a,voided at all costs The only journalist able to obtain regular access to the Prime Minister was Kerim Tabet, of the Mokattam. 396. The Wafdist newspapers’ support of the Nessim Government is, of course, explamed by the friendly relations between the Cabinet and the Wafd. ,, e . pberal. Palace and independent journals, with the single exception of the ilokattam, have been consistently hostile. Subsidies from secret funds had been stopped as soon as the Nessim Government came into power. In consequence, Italian propaganda agents were easily able to find ready recipients of their funds when, m the early summer, they launched a campaign in the local press for the purpose of creating embarrassment for both Nessim Pasha and His Majesty’s Government. The subject of Italian propaganda in Egypt is treated in detail m paragraphs 143-51 of this report. 397. The Wafdist Jehad came under a cloud in January as the result of a quarrel between its editor, Tewfik Diab, and Ahmed Maher/and the new daily edition of Rose-el-Youssef supplanted the Jehad for a time as the official morning Wafd paper under the joint editorship of Mahmoud Azmy and Abbas-al-Akkad, both of whom deserted the Jehad. During the summer, however, Al-Akkad wrote a virulent series of articles against the Minister of Education, and consequently the Wafd Executive had no alternative but to disavow the daily Rose-el-Y oussef for the sake of peace with the Cabinet. In the meantime the Jehad had come into its own again as the leading morning paper of the Wafd. Thereafter Al-Akkad directed his shafts against Nahas Pasha and Makram Obeid as well as the Government, and it was only by sacrificing Azmy and Al-Akkad that Mme. Rose-el-Youssef was able to gratify her desire to compromise with the Wafd on the basis of a cessation, in December, of the paper’s violent campaign against the Wafdist leaders. She then appointed Abdel Rahman Fahmy as her chief editor. Its policy is at present more cautious, but, though apparently independent, is working in the interest of the non-Wafdist elements of the United Front. 398. The Wafdist evening paper, Kawkab-esh-Sharq, retained Ahmed Maher as chief editor. Its proprietor, Hafez Awad, has also contributed frequent articles expounding Wafdist policy. Victor Adm, formerly editor of the defunct Wafdist weekly Goha, replaced Achille Sekaly as editor of the Alexandria daily newspaper, the Re for me, early in the year and gave its political editorials a moderate Wafdist colour. Name Ghanem, another pro-Wafdist Syrian, who was also previously associated with the Goha, directed the Patrie, which provides the foreign communities with expositions of Wafdist views in French. 399. The Shaab and Ittehad, organs of the two parties which are closely associated with the Palace, managed somehow to survive without, apparently, the Palace subsidies, which Aly Maher, according to his own assertions, had persuaded the King to abolish. As usual, their public has been limited to the parties’ supporters who are regular subscribers. The other Palace-Ittehad organ, the Liberie, quietly ceased publication at the end of December, when its editor, Edo-ar Gallad,'decided to launch an independent French newspaper of his own. The Shaab received a fresh stimulus in May, when Sidky Pasha returned to the presidency of the Shaab party and appointed his nephew, Ahmed Kamel, as chief editor; it immediately created a sensation by publishing the text of the King s reply to Nessim Pasha about the Constitution with the object of proving that the King himself, and not Nessim Pasha, had taken the initiative m suggesting the return of the Constitution. 400 The outstanding feature of the Siassa’s history during the year was its success in winning the notorious “ Integrity of Rule ” case referred to in paragraph No. 452 of the report for 1934. After sixty-three sessions lasting three and a half months, the Cairo Assize Court acquitted the chief editor and68 ^ ^ Vnccn on all charges. This verdict was hailed the concessionary proprietor r '' p as py the Siassa itself, as a severe by the Wyd 1S t and mdepe^ent pr^as wel^as ^ by parquet on behalf^Oh^former Ministers of Agriculture and Public Works had not come up for hearing by the end of the year. 401 During the whole period of Nessim Pasha’s tenure of office the 5W maintained a W attitude of hostility towards the Government and their alleged subservient attitude towards Great Britain. y 402 The removal of Ibrashi Pasha from the Palace in April brought the Goodwill of the Balagh into the market again; after casting around for a new n«?Ton the Balach ultimately found another source of support within the Palace mrcle namely Aly Maher. There is good reason to believe that it also received subsidies from the Italian propaganda organisation during the summer At the end of the year, however, its editor, Abdel Kader Hamza, became reconciled again to the Wafd. but made his return to his former political allegiance conditional on his retaining his liberty of action as a journalist. 403. The prestige of the A hr am was appreciably lowered during the summer months by its venal subservience to the dictates of Italian propagandists^ whose object was to create embarrassments for Nessim Pasha and His Majesty s Govern ment. Fortunately, these objectives were able to withstand the concentrated lire of the A hram sufficiently long to prove to the Italians that their generous outlay of cash was far from achieving the damage which they had hoped to* cause. 404. The Mokattam associated itself with the Nessim Government for the greater part of the year and was generally regarded as the Government s mouth piece. But even the Mokattam’s traditional stolidity eventually had to yield somewhat to the popular clamour for a return to constitutional life, and by the autumn the articles of its political editor were infused with more than a touch of acidity. It is open to conjecture whether this change was inspired by an interest in the paper’s circulation or by either Palace or Italian agencies. There is reason to suspect that Kerim Tabet was open to financial inducements from both sources. 405. Of the weekly reviews, the Wafdist satirical magazine Akhir Sa’a continued to amuse its readers with the gibes of cc Egypt Effendi,” extravagant political rumours and personal anecdotes, usually apocryphal. The weekly Rose-el-Youssef has been rather more pungent than its younger rival, especially since its proprietress fell foul of the Wafd, and certainly less humorous. The popularity of the Mussawar is well maintained, and Eikri Abaza still makes British imperialism the scapegoat for all sorts of ills to which Egypt in particular, and Arab countries in general, are liable at the present time. The Sarkha, organ of the Young Egypt Society, has suffered simultaneously from suspension and financial stringency and its appearances have been both irregular and infrequent. 406. Enkiri’s latest enterprise, backed by Italian funds, is a weekly magazine in French called Part out with articles of political and social interest. Its first number appeared in October and was strongly redolent of Italian inspiration. 407. In January Dr. Farid Bifai succeeded Mohammed Tawhid Selehdar Bey as Director of the Press Bureau. Two months later a Government commission was appointed to reorganise this Department with the idea of extending the sphere of its influence and activities. Despite this much-needed attempt to reform and develop the relations between the Government and the press, the Press Bureau has been unable to command the respect and authority which it ought to have, and its role continues to be more passive than active. As a result, the higher authorities m the Ministry of Interior, such as the Director-General of Public Security, or the Under-Secretary of State, have usually found it expedient to take ac ion themselves whenever it has been necessary to admonish editors about the publication ot tendentious or alarmist reports. at oq^A ^ &gt;ress .legislation was introduced in March, when, by Decree-Law °a i’ a P r ? vls ^ ns 0 [ ^ ^Mtive Penal Code governing press offences were made less drastic than those which had been enforced during the Sidky regime. Z^aZ 1 ^ 1 c ™i eSS10nS ? mo r ted t0 the ^lition of the penalty of suppression, nnlitinsJ n 1 ^* 0- 6 P® 1 J oc l® °t suspension, and a certain extension of freedom in modifications disappointed 6 PreSS ’ had h ° ped f ° r m0re g enerous409. Aftei a spate of alarmist and tendentious “ war news ” items and reports ot military movements, the Government was moved to issue Decree-Law .O' „ m November, empowering the Ministry of Interior to confiscate single issues ot newspapers, without previous warning, for publishing news which mignt endanger security or public order, and also to suspend newspapers guilty &gt;t subsequent offences. In the following month the Ministry of Interior issued a strictly worded circular to all newspapers stating that all mention of military movements was expressly forbidden except after reference to the Minister of War, who would communicate to the press such information as might be found necessary. These measures proved salutary. 410. The following table gives the Press Bureau’s estimate of the circula tion figures of the principal newspapers at the end of 1935. These figures are probably somewhat exaggerated, though doubtless relatively correct Arabic daily papers : Cairo— Al Ahram Al Moqattam ...

The continued rise indicates that the improved economic conditions noted last year have not suffered any set-back. The “ Society Misr pour le Transport et la Navigation ” provided for their transport in accordance with the twenty years concession granted in 1932. The Haramein Wakf. 412. After having suspended disbursements from the Haramein Wakf for six years at the King’s instigation, the Egyptian Government decided at the beginning of the year to consign 20,000 ardebs of wheat to the poor of Medina, and to pay the cost of its transport from Yenbo, the port of discharge, to Medina. The Saudi Minister of Finance undertook to effect transport within twenty days, but in July five-sixths of the consignment was still lying at the port and rapidly deteriorating, while the representations of the Egyptian consul passed unheeded. British Theatrical Season. 413. The negotiations for a British theatrical company to visit Egypt in 1935 broke down, but it was decided to attempt to bring out a company in the spring of 1936. The Egyptian Government agreed to offer a double subsidy of £E. 3,000 composed of the unused subsidy for 1935 as well as that for 1936. Negotiations were opened in the summer of 1935 through the Foreign Office with the object of securing a company with a wide repertory of well-known plays, representative of different periods of British drama. It was decided to try to obtain a company used to acting together and not one gathered together specially for an Egyptian visit, with one or two stars and a poor repertory. The Old Vic., Mr. Sydney Carroll’s company playing every summer in Regent’s Park, Mr. Drinkwater’s company and the Westminster Theatre were among the possibilities under consideration, but financial difficulties or the difficulty of fitting in dates prevented any of these companies coming. The Egyptian Government's' choice finally fell upon the Dublin Gate Theatre for a season in March 1936. I his is a repertory company producing a wide selection of well-known classics of all periods with modern methods of production and lighting. A repertory of seven plays, three Shakespeare, one Restoration comedy and three modern plays, was agreed upon. The British Community Council in A lexandria. ^ ^ met ^ n S of the British community in Alexandria on the v a , Janua u r y itwas decided to re-establish the British Community Council which tad been abolished m June 1932. The matter required careful handling as there was some danger of friction arising between His Majesty’s consul-general and the members of the new council Mr. Heathcote-Smith was inclined to oppose the formation of the council, but he was instructed by Mr. Peterson to confine himself submission*^ its ^statutes^to’the High^CommTssioner' 0n ^ dependent UP ° n. f , 415, W , hen the statutes were submitted, Sir Henry Barker the chairman l*ts for 'the” JubZ H P r d ^ ‘Z the Hne that mattere s ' ch as the arrange ments toi tire Jubilee and the entertainment of the fleet were solely the affair of HelXncv aTtfele 0 6 th d ° Tw ^ consul -g, ener al.

Alexandria Harbour. j ^ a : ns development of Alexandria Harbour have been considered at intervals for many years. In 1935, however, a modified scheme was proposed by the Ministry of Public Works, and Sir Cyril Kirkpatrick was invited ^ position and to make recommendations. No official information regarding the nature or extent of these recommendations was available at the end o± the year. It is understood, however, that various proposals have been under examination, amongst which are :— {a) Extension of the principal commercial quays into deeper water not involving a gain in length, but considerable possibilities in regard to quay accommodation of large draught vessels and improved railway service of quay and adjoining terrepleins. (b) Provision at the inner end of the harbour of suitable and separate accommodation for passenger liners, which would as a result no longer be berthed at commercial quays. (c) Removal of coaling jetty west, or demolition thereof, coupled with the cutting of a canal to Lake Maryout and establishment of a coal port there. The Alexandria Municipality. 417. The arrete modifying the decree of the 5th January, 1890, by which the Municipality of Alexandria was instituted, was published on the 3rd January as Decree-Law No. 1 of 1935. It provided for a municipal commission of 28 members, of which 6 were ex officio, 8 nominated by the Government and 14 were to be elected in accordance with the provisions of the new law. The 6 ex officio members were : the Governor of Alexandria, the Procureur-General of the Mixed Court of Appeal, the Director-General of Customs, the Chef du Parquet of the Native Courts of Alexandria, the senior medical officer in the public health service and the senior engineer in the public service at Alexandria. 418. The electoral colleges were abolished, and all persons aged 25, and occupying premises in Alexandria of a rental value of £E. 24, were entitled to be electors. An elector could not give more than one vote to any candidate, and was entitled to a number of votes equal to half plus one of the members to be elected, i.e., with 14 elected members each elector was entitled to 8 votes. 419. In Pebruary the French, Belgian and Italian Legations sent formal notes to the Egyptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs pointing out that the municipality had been established in 1890 by international agreement and that this transformation of it had been made unilaterally without their being •consulted. They therefore made all reserves regarding the law and arretes themselves, and regarding the conditions under which the agreement of their Governments to the levying of taxes upon their nationals should be maintained. Subsequently, on the 22nd May the United States Legation sent in a note reserving the rights of American nationals whose situation might be affected by the new law .and arretes. 420. As regards these protests, what had happened was that on the 13th October, 1934, the Italian, French and Greek representatives, as representative's of the three largest communities, were sent by the Residency copies o/the draft amendments to the 1890 law, and the draft arrete which it was proposed to issue under these amendments. At the same time, on Mr. Peterson s infractions it was made clear to them that, as no financial question was involved. His Maiesty’s Government in the United Kingdom did not consider that the nronosed changes required the consent of the Powers, they were also informed, confidentially, that His Majesty’s Government were Ztmn of'Cejnlrs had caused some anxiety, that by abandoning a claim to the taxation of .oreigneissstfc s consent of His Majesty s CtO\ eminent. 421 The view of the Judicial Adviser on these points was that as regards. His Majesty’s Government, the Alexandria Municipality question was covered the reservation to the discretion of His regards of foreign interests under the declaration of the ^8th Februaiy, 1922 As rega s the Powers Sir A. Booth considered that, in view of reserves made m l889, Franc could recall her assent to the payment of municipal taxes by French citizens on the ground that essential parts of the organic law had been modified by the recent legislation and, further, that in view of protests against certain arretes pie\iousl\ made, it seemed impossible to invoke usage in support of a contention that the had abandoned anv reserves formulated m 1889 or 1890. 422. Meanwhile, the publication of the new decree-law had aroused considerable agitation amongst the foreign communities, including the British in Alexandria. Notably, fears were expressed that under the new electoral system it would be impossible to get decent candidates to stand for election, and that the new law greafdy increased the control which the Ministry of the Interior exercised over the municipality. The French community informed their Minister that they would prefer to see the municipality abolished rather than risk working it under the new law. The newly-established British Community Council expressed their misgivings to the Residency in a letter, dated the 25th lebruary, in which they protested notably against the extension of the municipal franchise, and what they described as the conversion of an international institution with a predominantly European influence into what would practically be a Government sub-department. 423. The Foreign OffKj view was that, while the unsavoury record of the municipality amply justified a healthy supervisory control by the Ministry of the Interior, they did not think that this control should be allowed to reach the stage where it amounted to virtual annexation. 424. As regards the elections, the Director-General, European Depart ment's idea was that the consuls in Alexandria should agree on a list of foreign candidates and use all their influence to get the European vote concentrated on this list. The consuls, however, were not prepared to do this, and in view of the attitude adopted by the foreign communities, it finally became clear that it would be useless to attempt to hold the elections. Steps were therefore taken to have the elections postponed, and His Majesty's consul-general was instructed to concert with his French, Italian and Greek colleagues with a view to work out an alternative scheme adopting the principle of nomination of European councillors by the Egyptian Government, on the recommendation of either the foreign consuls or the High Commissioner. 425. The four consular officers unanimously agreed that the best plan would bo to adopt, without modification, the ‘‘methode d election des membres etrangers set forth in the annex to the draft decree of 1929. It subsequently transpired that their proposal was that the 1929 draft law should be adopted in toto. In view of the defects in that instrument, which had been brought to light by the examination of it the previous year, and particularly the perpetuation of the delegation, the High Commissioner informed Mr. Heathcote-Smith that e giavely doubted the wisdom of returning to it in toto, and he requested him to ascertain the views of his foreign colleagues regarding the following proposal made by Mr. Keown-Boyd designed to produce the 14-14 balance desired by His Majesty s Government and to provide a satisfactory commission, viz., that article 2 of the Decree-Law No. 1 of 1935 should be modified so as to provide for niiMnU-rf iirid 'y v 1 S i ° Ur E &amp;yP tlan and two foreign), twelve nominated foreign the Fo-vniinn P la ? m . ei, “bers elected and nominated, in such proportions as Eeswfncv a ^rt nme F deSlre ' Notes should be exchanged between the twelveTnrn^ h E ^,P tla “ Government in which it would be established that the twelve European members be nominated as follows : The British Greek French three ntmeVthe'remlin^Jf^Jp USt ° f * ix nameS each&gt; the A^ican “nail ee names, the remainder of the Powers two names each. From these lists theEgyptian Government would select at least two British, French, Greek and Italian men d-j rS anC ^ 0ne ^ rner ^ can member, the remaining posts being allotted to the candidates of most outstanding qualifications irrespective of nationality. 426. This pioposal was accepted by the Italian, Greek and French consuls- reneral. They also agreed to a proposal that the names of members nominated the commission must be resubmitted for recommendation, subject to a provision to safeguard the position regarding the reappointment of undesirable councillors. They also expressed themselves as satisfied with the provision in article 19 of Decree-Law No. 1 of 1935, by which any resolution of the commission vetoed by the Ministry of the Interior should be accompanied by a reasoned decision. This was the position at the end of the year. 427. Thus, through the year the Alexandria Municipality continued to be administered by the temporary commission set up in 1934. In January Sadek Younes Pasha was appointed Director-General, and Mr. R. Davies, formerly Secretary for Economic Development in the Sudan and a member of the Governor-General’s Council, was appointed Sub-Director-General in succession to the late Mr. Coatsworth on the 23rd January on a five-year contract with a salary of £E. 1,500 per annum. Mr. Atkinson was appointed chief engineer to the municipality and Colonel Thornton to the post of chief inspector. 428. The temporary commission, on the whole, functioned well, and during the course of the year Mr. Davies was able to establish his position. The close personal contact maintained between Mr. Davies in Alexandria and Mr. Keown-Boyd in the Ministry of the Interior in Cairo proved most useful in helping to straighten out the tangled affairs of the municipality.

MV predecessor at the end of 1933 recorded that the disappearance of Sidky Pasha had left the Palace looming ominously large on the Egyptian stage, while popular feeling against Ibrashi Pasha was strong. In February 1934 King Faud caught a chill, his illness in the summer and autumn became acute, and though he struggled through he wa,s not expected to survive the year. His incapacitation at once emphasised the influence which Ibrashi Pasha had established over the Ministry of the weak, vain, but honest Prime Minister Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha. I he latter, through chronic obstruction, drifted into an impasse in 0 v em ber and resigned to give way to Tewfik Nessim Pasha, whose intention was to torm a strong Government of leading personalities to set Egypt’s house in ordei. I his he failed to do, partly owing to Koyal obstruction, and the Wafd weie encouraged to believe and assiduously propaganded that his Government was only to prepare the way for their return to power. /n ^s^Gions, I submitted my views on policy, which were Oofohm b d ° pt t ed by i Hl ^ ^ /Ij y est y’ s Government in the United Kingdom in con pent rat a fvn ^ ecid ^ that treat y negotiations were impracticable, and to relaGons P 16 stren £ themn g and development of Anglo-Egyptian economic of thPveof’.fnTiTo!!

Attempted Italian encroachments over the Sudan frontier from ibya were checked by the occupation in January of Merga and the Kharkour Mourr wells at Oweinat by the Royal Air Force and Sudan Defence Force. An agieement, satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, was finally reached with the Italian Government, the Egyptian Government being kept informed. Crime statistics for the year, though showing a slight decrease, remained unsatisfactory, and, as a result of representations made to the Minister of the Interior m January, steps were taken with the object of gaining greater security tor foreigners living in the Provinces and generally to improve the work of the P an( i fPc Parquet and to secure the selection of judges of character and ability to try murder cases in the Native Courts. The Narcotics Bureau functioned actively during the year and available evidence indicates that the smuggling of white drugs has sensibly diminished. The economic recovery which commenced in the autumn of 1933 was reflected m surpluses of £E. 1,081,000 in the State budget and £E. 355,000 in the railway budget. In consequence the ban on increases of pay and promotion in the civil service in force since 1931 was removed. No new steps were, however, taken to relieve debtors on agricultural mortgages. The index figure of wholesale prices which had reached its lowest in May, 1933, was fifteen per cent, higher a year later and has continued to rise. The base of the recovery was the large cotton crop of 1933-34 (8,575,000 kantars) disposed of at an average price 7 per cent, higher than that of the previous year. The recovery appeared to be shared equally by the business and agricultural communities and several striking statistics showed the widespread nature of the recovery amongst the masses of the farming population. While the prospects of continued recovery, which depend entirely on cotton, are good, the position existing before the crisis is far from being restored, mortgage debtors in particular being heavily involved in difficulties. Chapter I.—Internal Politics and Relations with the British Empire. The year opened in Egypt in an atmosphere of general expectation, hopeful on the part of the Opposition, fearful on the part of. the Palace and the Govern ment. In spite of London press statements to the contrary, the belief in Egypt was general that the transfer of Sir Percy Loraine and my appointment denoted a forthcoming change of the Egyptian policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. 2. I arrived in Egypt on the 7th January. Immediately on my arrival the Prime Minister, Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha, made himself objectionable by refusing to submit to the usual protocol of visits between the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister. The result was that he did not pay his first official visit to me until my return from England in February. The King received me cordially, but supported his Primes Minister’s obstinate refusal to call. His Majesty made reference to the desirability of a treaty settlement but did not discuss politics generally. 3. After ten days in Egypt I left for England on the 17th January and Mr. Yencken remained in charge.4 The only significant internal political event during my brief absence was the issue of a decree by the King on the 27th January, imposing^ on Ministers before assuming their functions an obligation to swear an oath of fidelity to the King and the Constitution. The object of this decree obviously was to render more difficult the access to the Government of Opposition elements who refused to recognise the legality of the Constitution of 1930. It was generally considered that this decree was one of the King’s efforts to dig himself m m view of the expected offensive from the new Pligh Commissioner. 5 Immediately before the issue of this decree on the 26th January, the King had a bad attack of influenza, which went to his lungs. His recovery was very slow, and he was confined to his room for a couple of months, only emerging in late March, when his first public act was to administer to his Ministers the oath imposed by the above-mentioned decree. 6. I returned from England on the 17th February. The Prime Minister, in virtue of the protocol settlement which had been arranged in London, paid his first official call, and friendly relations were established. Unfortunately, Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha was quite inadequate to deal with a deteriorating political and administrative situation or with the delicate and complex questions arising out of Anglo-Egyptian relations. He was not only incompetent and lazy but filled with an inordinate sense of his own importance. He was quick to see slights where none were intended, and showed himself very obstructive to us in many affairs both great and small. Within his own Cabinet he exercised practi cally no control, and all his Ministers disregarded him and took their orders from Zaki el Ibrashi Pasha. The acme of Palace Government was reached during the first half of the year. 7. His Majesty was not well enough to receive me on my return, and I did not see him until the 23rd March. His appearance was disquieting : he was thinner, and his eyes seemed lifeless. It was obvious that his general health had been impaired by his illness. He expressed the view that the Wafd were entirely discredited and that party differences were a complete obstacle to any real coalition. If His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, he said, were waiting for a Government formed on a broad national basis, they would wait in vain. Much better negotiate with the present regime, whose signature His Majesty undertook to see honoured. No response was made to this invitation. 8. During the first half of the year the anti-foreign campaign, which had been initiated by the Palace Government at the end of Sidky Pasha’s tenure of office, was carried on with increased energy. The Debt case, of course, provided strong and reasonable ground for Egyptian discontent, wffiich was imprudently fanned by the Government. The campaign against the Mixed Courts (see para- giaphs 224 and 225) was also encouraged by the Government to a dangerous degree A servile Parliament was mobilised in this campaign, and the press suitably stimulated. Foreign utility companies were also bitterly attacked, both n 001 J A the Government as well as by Parliament and the press. Ministers allowed themselves to use most unsuitable language and to make partly unjusti fiable attacks on some of these companies. The Young Egypt Society, a sort of students and others, carried on a violent tffiiMt pnirwo 8 ] ^V afd strongly disapproved of this body it was suspected forthenmlrl ^ a Jr o 6 en . c 9 U] ^D ein ® r d but no proof of this affiliation was ever with thp kT,,,, .i.

The Wafd remainedpowerless to create disorders and, while still maintaining the monopoly of popular sympathy, had lost much of their prestige owing to their long absence from office and to their inability any longer to embarrass the administration in the -Provinces. 10. The Liberals stagnated in an equivocal position as nominal allies of the Wafd but in profound disagreement with them. On Hafez Afifi Pasha’s resignation of his post as Egyptian Minister in London (see paragraph 47) the Liberal party passed a resolution urging close co-operation between Mohammed Mahmoud Pasha and Dr. Hafez Afifi Pasha. Although Hafez Afifi did not join the Liberal party he remained in close contact with them and the dissident Wafdists, who acted more or less in agreement with the Liberals and were as powerless as they. 11. Sidky Pasha’s attempts to make trouble for the Government (see para graph 30 of the annual report for 1933) did not succeed in creating any parliamentary embarrassment for the Cabinet. In connexion with the report of the Corniche Road Commission (see paragraph 376), which made several equivocal mentions of Sidky Pasha, the latter, on the eve of his departure for Europe in May, demanded an immediate hearing in Parliament; this was refused on the ground of more urgent business. He therefore published some of the unsavoury details of the relations between Abboud Pasha and the Minister of Public Works and Ibrashi Pasha in connexion with the Gebel Aulia dam contract. This offensive, which Sidky had announced as likely to bring about the fall of the regime, turned out to be rather a tame affair and had no effect in shaking the regime, which in any case did not rest on a reputation for integrity. 12. The Shaab and Ittehad parties continued to collaborate under Palace dictation. This imposed collaboration lent an air of unreality to the proceedings of Parliament which were mainly a reflection of Palace desires. Parliament rose on the 28th June without having given the Government any cause for anxiety. 13. The Government soon found themselves involved in trouble with the Native Bar. At the end of December 1933 they passed a law by which any lawyer convicted by the Council of Discipline forfeited eligibility to membership of the Bar Council. This law was made retroactive in order to invalidate the election of Makram Obeid, who, after having been reprimanded by the Council of Discipline, was elected President of the Bar Council. Constitutionally it was doubtful whether such a law could be made retroactive. Anyhow, the Bar refused to elect another president. The Government accordingly dissolved the Bar Council and proceeded to elaborate legislation for the election of a Bar Council on lines which would have precluded Makram Ooeid s candidatuie. btiong criticism by the Judicial Commission of the Senate in May led the Government t 0 shelve their Bill until the parliamentary recess, but within a week of Parlia ment rising, on the 5th July, decree-laws dealing with this question were suddenly promulgated The challenge was vigorously taken up, and the Government s w^rA riAvpr offeetivelv enforced. Wiser counsels might have deterrea assumption of office, this legislation was the first of that promulgated under the 1930 regime to be rescinded (by decree-laws of the 20th December). ia tVia fPwArnrnent were also involved in some trouble with ex-Nabil 15. Official mvestiga and of the administration [11244]tion of the Corniche Road affair) aroused no enthusiasm for the Government. The public made no attempt to draw flattering comparisons between Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha’s Ministry and the predecessor whose misdeeds it unearthed, seeing only a background and methods common to both. By July a note of cynicism and disillusion was constant in references to an Administration in which partiality and corruption were assumed as normal. To these factors of discontent may be added the new motor tax, which provoked widespread criticism and sporadic taxi strikes; and a sudden rise in the price of bread. 16. A movement in favour of renewed political activity gained impetus with a decision approved by the Executive Committee of the Wafd on the 14th June to summon a Wafdist congress in July. Later decisions postponed the congress until September, December and, finally, January 1935; but its organisation kept Wafdist interest alive during the second half of the year. 17. More immediate effect was given to the Wafd’s policy of impressing the new High Commissioner with their importance by a series of visits paid by INahas Pasha and Makram Obeid to Port Said, Ismailia and Zagazig, between the 29th July and the 1st August. These visits were accompanied by disturbances, wilfully provoked by the visitors, and the police had on more than one occasion to hre on the crowd. The results, however, were disappointing to Wafdist hopes in their revelation of diminished popular enthusiasm. A hint was conveyed to the Wafd that, if the object of such tours was to impress the High Commissioner, the method was ill chosen; and, except for one later visit to Tantah, Nahas Pasha made no more provincial visits. it uecaxim apparent, irom me strengm and frequency of rumours of a further deterioration in King Fuad’s health, that the problem presented by His Majesty’s possible early death called for serious consideration. rince Farouk, the Heir Apparent, is a boy of 14 and will not, under Egyptian law, attain his majority until 1938. King Fuad, who was credibly reported to be a very sick man, is 66 years of age. Examination of the constitutional and other provisions for a Regency revealed a position of singular complexity. 19.

Ihe prospects for Egypt in the event of King Fuad’s death appeared unfavourable, the nomination of the Council of Regents, as explained above, fy ^ th ®. King s hands, subject to conhrmation by Parliament after the King’s death, hiothing definite was known as to His Majesty’s choice, but it was rumoured with every appearance of likelihood that Ibrashi Pasha and Taher -Pasha, despite technical disqualifications, were in King Fuad’s mind, if not indeed, already nominated. 24. The Government, shorn of feidky, was incompetent as well as unpopular; its sole virtue lay in the personal integrity of the Prime Minister, an asset which was more than counterbalanced by the doubtful reputation of some of Abdel Fattah s colleagues, notably Ibrahim Fahmy Kerim Pasha and Menzalawi Bey. The heir apparent was a minor of whom little or nothing was known. It seemed probable that the King s death would face His Majesty’s Government with the uncomfortable alternatives of bolstering up by British arms a corrupt and unpopular regime, which after Sidky’s elimination owed whatever it possessed of motive power entirely to the King himself, or of intervening in Egyptian affairs to an extent in itself unlikely to be welcome in London, and which could hardly fail in the end to occasion a renewed outburst of Nationalist feeling in Egypt. 25. In order to obviate this potential dilemma, the Acting High Com missioner sought the authority of the Secretary of State to advise the Prime Minister to strengthen his Cabinet by replacing the two Ministers mentioned above and by eliminating the interference of Ibrashi, the head of the Eoyal Khassa, in the administration of the country. Before a reply could be received to this proposal, Abdel Fattah Yehia himself, on the 3rd October, following upon a conversation on the subject of the Alexandria municipality and under the influence of alarming reports of King Fuad’s health, broached to Mr. Peterson the question of the King’s death and the situation involving “our joint responsibility ” which would result from that event. The Prime Minister asked for co-operation and close contact with the Residency; and his subsequent denials that he had requested “advice ” were presumably based on the casuistical con tention that co-operation can be given without counsel as well as on the impotent thesis that it is sufficient to foresee an event fraught with danger without making provision against it. 26. The Prime Minister’s appeal was regarded in the Foreign Office as removing the last objection to the tendering of advice, and on the 6th October Mr. Peterson, acting on instructions, urged Abdel Fattah Yehia to strengthen his Administration by jettisoning the two Ministers and securing the elimination of Ibrashi’s political influence without which no Minister worth having could be expected to join the Government. 27. The Prime Minister’s reply, influenced on this occasion by more reassuring reports of King Fuad’s health, was a friendly but uncompromising refusal to consider any changes of any kind until His Majesty was sufficiently recovered to be consulted fully. To this attitude he continued, in the weeks which followed, to adhere. 28. Meanwhile, on the 4th October, the Acting High Commissioner paid a visit of a few hours to Cairo, in the course of which he called on Tewfik Nessim Pasha, an ex-Prime Minister and ex-“ Chef du Cabinet Royal.” Mr. Peterson had known Nessim Pasha during his previous period of service in the Residency, and had travelled with him across the Mediterranean in September, on which occasion Nessim had insisted, with every appearance of sincerity, on the necessity of co-operation between Great Britain and Egypt. The visit was in part a fulfilment of a promise then given, and in part due to a desire to obtain the views of the best exponent of moderate Egyptian opinion. Nessim declared himself in favour of a gradual reform of the Administration, more drastic measures being left over until it should become plain that they were called for. On the subject of the composition of the Council of Regency, his views were in close accord with those already put forward to London by the Residency. 29. The first sign of any effort to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom became apparent when, on the 11th October, AlyB Maher Pasha, a former member of Sidky’s Government, called at the ^^cy to sav that he was being pressed to accept the position of Chef du Cabinet Royal” which had been vacant since Nessim's resignation, and the dunes of which had been usurped by Ibrashi. Incidentally this proposal could hardly have been made without King' Fuad’s sanction, and the visit served to confirm the impression that, whatever the natural reluctance of His Majesty s Ministers to force decisions upon His Majesty, King iuad was m fact au courant of all that was going on. Aly Maher was advised by Mr. Peterson not to accept office m the Palace so long as Ibrashi remained there, and to this advice, although expressly personal in character, Aly Maher, to his credit, adhered. The subse quent appointment of Ziwer Pasha to the vacant post was enected without the Residency being consulted in any way. 30. The Residency moved back from Alexandria to Cairo on the 1 PtP Optnhpr 31. The inclination of the Foreign Office in this conjuncture of affairs was to move cautiously and to afford Abdel Fattah Yehia every chance to implement his undertaking to take up the question of the reform of the Administration with King Fuad as soon as His Majesty was sufficiently recovered. That this point had not, in Abdel Fattah Yehia’s opinion, as yet been reached was made clear by the Prime Minister to Mr. Peterson in a further conversation on the 20th October. In the course of this conversation, the Prime Minister advanced the rather disquieting suggestion that the proposals might, if His Majesty’s Government so desired, be taken as addressed to the Egyptian Government. 32. The sinister import of this suggestion lay in its coincidence with the more violent phases of a political controversy in the Egyptian press, in which the policy and aims of His Majesty’s Government were freely and generally inaccurately discussed. It was already noteworthy that our alleged dislike of Ibrashi’s influence was nowhere resented; but all kinds of absurd intentions which were attributed to us in the matter of the Regency, such as the immediate appointment of Prince Mohammed Ali as sole Regent, were provocative of a violent difference of opinion, in which the Government-subsidised organs professed to see British intervention in internal affairs. There was little room for doubt that the Prime Minister was at this stage yielding to the temptation to effect the rehabilitation of his Ministry, not by accepting our advice, but by seeking what credit he could secure for rejecting it. 33. His Majesty’s Government at this time declined to approve the Acting High Commissioner’s suggestion that he should seek an audience of King Fuad with a view to pressing for a change of Ministry. But the momentum already acquired, which in Cairo at one time seemed in danger of being lost, was considerable, and the Government’s own mistakes hastened the process of dissolution. A libel case, brought at the instance of Ibrahim Fahmy Kerim Pasha and Aly Menzalawi Bey in February against the Siassa newspaper, had enabled the Pr ime Minister to dismiss any criticism of these two Ministers as a matter sub judice. His sudden decision to advance the hearing of the case, and its inscription before a court notoriously subservient to Ibrashi’s influence, aroused a storm of protest and led to the two Ministers offering him their resignation. At about the same time, an ill-inspired protest by the Egyptian Charge d Affaires m London against the tone of London press-comment on the situation afforded occasion for a salutary rebuff, which further weakened the Ministry s position. rvmn a fn-p i been appointed “Chef du Cabinet Reyal ” on the 27th October, and the Residency lost no time m getting into touch with the new at the pi 7 Ylded - The Kin g w as still in Alexandria; but at tne beginning of November Ziwer came to Cairo and besom a series nf conversations with the Acting High Commissioner, which Resulted in the expression of advice by His Majesty’s Government that IbrashCs improper p”™ ofTprL Mlnrste^f 7 ZlWet - 8 ° Wn guarantee, bi^yThe Government res?med M on the S £n J en0U | h t0 re j 18t l 1 ’ Abdel Fattah Yehia ’s government resigned on the 6th November, and, after a further neriod of tors^cepZceLf o a ^ Pt The 116 Tewfik Nessim P^a'attachel acceptance of office.

The new Prime Minister took some time to form his Cabinet, for in the course of conversation at the Residency he explained that he preferred to include only persons of no political attachments or history; and such are rare in Egypt. lad been expected, and in many quarters hoped, that he would select the most able politicians available to him (the Wafd refusing to enter any coalition); but ms anxiety to avoid invidious criticism from any quarter virtually limited his choice to the higher ranks of officialdom. He was at one moment prepared to include Hassan Sabry Bey, who had been in an almost constant minority of one m Abdel Fattah Yehia s Cabinet, the Wafd, however, vetoed this appointment, as also that of Mahmoud Hassan Bey for the Ministry of Interior. When Nessim Pasha left for Alexandria on the 14th November to submit his Cabinet to the King, he had no reserves for his team, and King Fuad’s rejection of his candidates for the Ministry of Inferior and Foreign Affairs reduced him to a Cabinet of eight, with three Ministers duplicating portfolios. 37. The Cabinet, as finally constituted on the 15th November, was as follows :— Mohammed Tewfik Nessim Pasha : Prime Minister and Minister of Interior. Amin Anis Pasha : Minister of Justice. Ahmed Abdul W ahab Pasha : Minister of Finance. Neguib-el-Hilaly Bey : Minister of Education. Abdel Meguid Omar Bey: Minister of Public Works and Communications. Kamel Ibrahim Bey : Minister for Foreign Affairs and Agriculture. Tewfik Abdulla Pasha-: Minister of War. Abdel Aziz Mohammed Bey : Minister of Waqfs. 38. All Nessim’s Ministers are or were permanent officials, and, although they have a reputation for honesty among Egyptians, Abdul Wahab Pasha is the only one of any known personality. None of the Ministers are politicians. Abdul Wahab, however, is generally supposed to be very friendly to the Wafd. Kamel Ibrahim has Wafdist sympathies and was one of the judges who acquitted Maher and Nokrashi in May 1926. 39. The general opinion was that Tewfik Nessim had made a great mistake in not forming a political Ministry. An administrative Cabinet of this type could only convey the impression that Nessim was a bridge to Wafdist government on the analogy of the Adly Government of October-December 1929. Moreover, the fact thathe had submitted to dictation by the Wafd in the formation of his Government naturally accentuated this impression. Had Isessim invited leading members of the different political parties to join him in his task of reconstruction, the probability is that the Wafd would have refused. Nessim could then have formed a political Government from members of all other parties and from Independents. Such a political Ministry would have shown clearly to the country that there was no intention of truckling to the Wafd. As it is, it soon became evident all over Egypt that the general impression was that we had brought Nessim into power to bring back the Wafd. Needless to say, this impression was carefully fostered by the Wafd, who, according tp reports, are now being able to replenish their coffers to a certain extent by extracting money from candidates for official posts or seats in the future Parliament. 40. Had the Residency been able to intervene and urge Nessnn to appoint a Dolitical Cabinet of a type able to stand up against both the Wafd and the Palace it is probable that we should have been able to induce Nessnn to form such r, r a binet However, in view of the previous instruction of His Majesty s Govei f Ap pff ec t that the Acting High Commissioner should not associate himself with the^chcdce^of^bdel Fattah ylhia’s successor to an extent involving anyanoearance of responsibility for his subsequent actions and policy, Mr. Peterson felt unable to impose particular Ministers on Nessim 1 asha, or to do more than offer personal suggestions which Nessim did not choose to interpret as imperative. 41 . If Nessim’s truckling to the Wafd in his Cabinet formation had a harmful effect in the country, the Prime Minister’s weakness m not maintaining his candidates against Palace opposition disappointed many who had hoped that Nessim’s regime meant an end to Palace dictation. 42 His Maiesty returned to Cairo from Alexandria on the 23rd November, and on the 30th November he signed a Royal rescript abolishing the constitutional regime of 1930, maintaining the Regency decrees of the 13th a . n&lt; ^ Law No 28 of 1922 regarding the status of the ex-Khedive. The rescript provided that pending the establishment of a new constitutional regime the country should be governed according to the constitutional pi mciples in force since the introduction of the constitutional regime in Lgypt as regards the f 01 - 01 and attributes of the Egyptian State, the source and division of powers and the rights and duties of citizens. Pending the establishment of a new Constitution the legislative power and all other powers reserved hitherto to Parliament, as well as the executive power, are to be exercised by the King through the intermediary and under the responsibility of the Cabinet in conformity with the principles of liberty and equality at the base of constitutional liberty in Egypt. 43. The rest of the year was mainly characterised by the efforts of the Wafd to impose their views on Nessim while avoiding a break with him. The principal questions between them were the reinstatement of officials and of omdas and sheikhs dismissed during the abolished regime for political reasons, the dismissal of officials regarded as special protagonists of the arbitrarinesses ascribed to the late regime, the holding of a Wafdist Congress in the beginning of January, and the Wafd’s desire for a return of the 1923 Constitution. As regards the reinstate ment of officials, Nessim Pasha has shown a laudable desire to avoid wholesale and speedy reinstatements, which could only strengthen the impression that the Wafd were on their way to power. With regard to the omdas and sheikhs, Nessim at me time proposed to dismiss between 1,500 and 2,000, and to fill their posts by elections by the Sheikhs’ Commission. Fortunately, however, at present, he appears inclined only to dismiss about 600 omdas and sheikhs, who are nominally eligible for re-election. 44. With regard to the Wafdist Congress, it might have been desirable to have prohibited it altogether on some pretext or another. Nessim confined himself to endeavouring to limit the numbers of those attending the congress, which, however, promises to be fairly large. Obviously, such a congress must encourage the belief that the Wafd are approaching power. 45. As regards the return to the 1923 Constitution, Nessim Pasha informed the Acting High Commissioner that Nahas Pasha had pressed for this. Nessim Pasha had replied that the 1923 Constitution required amendment. Nahas suggested that any amendment to it should be by Parliament, as provided by the Constitution itself. Nessim Pasha told Mr. Peterson that he had made it clear to Nahas that he had no intention of having a Parliament before the Constitution, and that he contemplated a committee of thirty or forty members, to be charged with the drawing up of a new Constitution. 46. Nessim Pasha continued to have difficulties with the King, who opposed most of his proposals for appointments, whether for the rectorships of A1 Azhar and the Egyptian University or for more purely official posts. The state of the King s health continued to be very bad, and Nessim Pasha complained that His Majesty s irritability, owing to bad health, made the transaction of business exceedingly difficult. ^ Th® a PP 0 i n tment of Hassan Sabry Bey as Minister in London provoked the Waf d to its first angry criticism of Nessim’s Government, but this storm seems to have died down for the moment. 48- The year closed in an atmosphere of anxiety owing to the uncertainty w ether Tewfik Tsessim Pasha, unsupported by a political Cabinet, could stand up effectively to the Palace and the Wafd. A moderate non-party Prime MinisterNessim has voluntarily deprived himself; of the second, he is no doubUmcertein # f 9 ; -‘'’'glo-ligyfitian relations during the present year have been nriimrilv thf mprlcttab^ 111 ?

It was impossible to maintain any longer the pretence of Ministerial responsibility or constitutional government in the conditions prevailing during the greater part of the present year. The increasing arbitrariness and corruption of the regime were becoming intolerable particularly as we were made responsible for all its misdeeds. The fact that the legime depended for its continuance on British elements in the forces of public order and on the presence of the British Army of Occupation made it difficult for us to be mdinerent to the subjection of the Egyptian people to this arbitrary rule. Ibis particular aspect of the Egyptian question formed the subject of discussions m London during my presence there at the beginning of the year together with the more general issues of the 1922 Declaration and treaty negotiations. On my return and after further study of the situation, I suggested the desirability of my intervening discreetly to restrain the more flagrant acts of royal arbitrariness. His Majesty’s Government, however, thought it advisable to limit intervention to the four reserved points, widely interpreted, pending the examination of general policy in Egypt which had been instituted. In July, I submitted to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom my views on general policy. These views, after consideration by the various Departments concerned, were generally adopted by His Majesty’s Government in October. The policy of His Majesty’s Government then adopted was that treaty negotia tions should be regarded as impracticable for the present and that meanwhile we should take a more active interest in the good administration of the country and concentrate on the development of economic relations between England and Egypt. 51. On the access to power of the Nessim Government, the Acting High Commissioner, on instructions from His Majesty’s Government, made an important communication of policy to the Prime Minister, and subsequently to the King. In this, communication, His Majesty’s Govern ment expressed the desire to work in close and friendly co-operation with the Egyptian Government and people. For this purpose the High Commissioner was authorised to discuss with the Egyptian authorities, as they arose, questions to which the latter attached importance. 52. The communication then emphasised that it would be erroneous to suppose that His Majesty’s Government would necessarily be able to carry out this helpful policy in the absence of suitable co-operation from Egypt. Stress was laid on the necessity for handling Anglo-Egyptian relations on a realistic basis. The protection of our imperial communications demanded our presence in E^ypt and obliged His Majesty’s Government to take immediate cognisance of political events in that country. It was hoped that Egyptian patriotism in the light of the foregoing facts would be directed into practical channels and that Egyptian statesmen would realise that they have everything to gain and nothing to lose through constructive co-operation with Great Britain, the only country able to assist Egypt in any practical way. 53. The Prime Minister replied that he agreed entirely with, and welcomed, the views expressed by Elis Majesty’s Government. He realised that co-operation and realism were the key-notes of this communication and the necessity of bringing his Cabinet gradually to realise that these words represented his policy,and ours. 54. His Majesty, to whom Mr. Peterson subsequently made a similar communication, offered no comment.Chapter II. —^International Relations. Abyssinia. t 55. The Abyssinian Government in December established consular represen tation in Egypt by appointing a consul to reside m Port Said. The mam duties of the consul will be to assist Abyssinian pilgrims visiting Palestine and to endeavour to develop trade relations, more particularly the export of Abyssinian noffee to Eervnt. A fghanistan. 56. At the close of the year, the press was informed that the Egyptian Government were considering the establishment of a Legation in Kabul. It was reported in the press that the Afghan Minister had been instructed to intimate to the Government that, unless this step were taken, the Afghan Legation m Cairo would be closed. Germany. 57. There has been a good deal of propaganda in Egypt during the year in favour of the present regime in Germany. There seems little doubt that this propaganda is fostered by the German Legation, who are alleged to have subsidised a number of newspapers. The Egyptian Public Security authorities have lather frowned upon the movement in view of the large number of Jews in the country, and the attitude of the French colony, but it has not been necessary to take any official action in the matter. 58. The German Legation is reported to have made almost daily represen tations to the Egyptian Government regarding the attitude towards Germany adopted by that not inconsiderable section of the press which is under Jewish influence. The Jews on their side complained that an invitation to a public gathering published in the press by the German community contained the words “Death to Judah.” 59. There have been three cases in which Jewish boys have been arrested for insulting the German flag. In the first case a fine was imposed, the accused was acquitted in the second case, and the third, in which two French and three Egyptian boys are concerned, has not yet been before the courts. 60. Earlier in the year, the Mixed Courts rendered judgment in the action brought by M. Jabes, an Italian Jew, against the president of the German community claiming damages for slander of the Jews in a pamphlet issued under his auspices. The action was dismissed with costs, the court holding that a civil action for damages could only be justified in the event of the infringement of physical, moral or economic rights of an individual, and that an individual action could not be admitted except when the claimant is part of a collectivity, specifically determined and circumscribed, of which all the members, without exception, are the object of defamatory accusations. The court’s decision was received with great satisfaction by the local German community and was hailed in Germany as an “outstanding victory ” for the Nazi regime. Iraq. 61. The Iraqi consulate-general in Cairo was raised on the 20th January to Legation status, and the vice-consul, Sayed Abdel Kader-el-Gilani, appointed third secretary and Charge d’Affaires pending the arrival in Egypt of the Emir Zeid, half-brother to King Feisal, whose appointment as Iraqi Minister at the Court of King Fuad was published in the Iraq Official Gazette on the 22nd January. The Egyptian Government, arguing that Sayed Abdel Kader-el-Gilani coula not take charge of a Legation before it had actually been constituted y csentation of the Emir Zeid’s letters of credence, refused to admit him as a Cnarge d Affaires, and the Legation communicates with the Ministry for h oreign Affairs by third-person correspondence. This arrangement has continued rougiout the year for the Emir Zeid, who incurred his sovereign’s displeasure y marrying a Turkish divorcee in Athens in April, seems unlikely to take up his appointment m Cairo. He formally resigned at the time, but no notification has been received that his resignation has been accepted.62.

The Italian Government are reported to have offered free university education to four selected students from the Egyptian schools. 65. The Government were subjected to considerable newspaper criticism their acquiescence in the agreement regarding the delimitation of the Sudan—Eibya boundary in the Owenat area which is referred to in paragraph on the usual ground that the Sudan is an integral part of Egypt. 66. The King of Italy, travelling on the Royal yacht to Italian Spmaliland, passed through the Suez Canal twice during the year and was on each occasion greeted by a representative of King Fuad. His Majesty inspected various Italian institutions after being greeted on the landing stage by some 2,000 of his subjects. J a-pan. 67. In August the Prime Minister confirmed the newspaper report that the Japanese Legation had decided to establish a Legation in Cairo, but no representative has yet arrived. 68. Mr. Okada, who headed the Japanese delegation to Lancashire, where abortive negotiations were conducted with United Kingdom cotton interests, visited Egypt in April. He was accompanied by the other members of the delegation and contact was established with the Egyptian Chamber of Commerce, who extended hospitality to them. The delegation offered a dinner in honour of the then Prime Minister. Palestine. 69. The proposed extradition treaty between Egypt and Palestine, which is to replace the temporally agreement of 1922, was under consideration by the Colonial Office, Foreign Office and other Departments interested during the year. Various amendments to the original draft w r ere debated, and it was decided that this instrument should be in the form of an agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom (on behalf of the Government of Palestine) and the Egyptian Government and that, when negotiations for the conclusion of the agreement are nearing completion, the High Commissioner for Egypt should be furnished with full powers to sign on behalf of the United Kingdom. No communication on the subject was addressed to the Egyptian Government during the year. Saudi A rabia. 70. Officially, Saudi-Egyptian relations continued to be unsatisfactory, and no progress was made during the year towards Egyptian recognition of Ibn Sand’s Government. Public feeling in favour of such recognition was encou raged by the issue of the Saudi-Yemen hostilities and by the extension to the Hejaz of the activities of Banque Misr. Jalaat Harb Pasha and his fellow- directors paid two visits to Jedda and Mecca in connexion with the establishment of a branch of Banque Misr in Jedda and with their pilgrim transport contract for the 1934-35 season. It was rumoured in December that Midhat Yeghen Pasha who accompanied Talaat Harb Pasha, had a mandate from Tewfik Nessim Pasha to discuss Saudi-Egyptian relations with the Saudi Government; but that no opportunity for discussion presented itself. Switzerland. . , . . , , 71 On the 7th June a treaty of friendship was signed m Cairo between 7 ffV pt and Switzerland, which provided for the appointment of diplomatic and insular officers by each State in the territory of the other.14 72 As explained in paragraph 62 of last year’s report Swiss citizens in E^vot have enjoyed judicial protection by His Majesty’s Government m he United Kingdom*, the French or the Italian Government at the choice of the • A' irlnnl nrifl rather surprisingly in view of the existing nationalistic feeling Sf^n^r^^n extra-territorial privileges, the Egyptian Government by an exchange of notes agreed that the position should remain unaltered in this respect. Turkey. . 73 Negotiations for the long-delayed Turco-Egyptian Treaty of Friendship seemed likely to bear fruit in August, when the Egyptian Minister m Angora returned to Turkey with a draft embodying Turkish abandonment of the claim to capitulatory status and Turkish recognition of the Egyptian nationality of members of the Egyptian Royal family. These points had been the mam obstacles to previous agreement. The proposed treaty was to be a single document divided into three parts relating to (1) friendship; (2) establishment; and (3) nationality, an d, m view of the considerable concessions made by Turkey to Egyptian sentiment, there was good ground for hope that agreement might be reached. Unfortunately, difficulties arose from various aspects of personal status, which in Egypt are dealt with by religious courts and in Turkey by civil courts. Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha, in conversation with the Acting High Commissioner in September, referred more particularly to the case of marriages between Muslims and non-Muslims, which are recognised in Turkey, but not in Egypt, and anticipated a deadlock. 74. The attitude of the Turkish Government is reported to be one of complete detachment regarding the internal affairs of Egypt; all they desire is to establish a basis on which the two countries can exist on reasonably friendly relations. The Yemen. 75. A Mecca report in July to the effect that the Imam of the Yemen had appointed Sheikh Mohammed Zabara, Minister of the Palace, to be Yemeni representative in Egypt, received publicity in the Egyptian press but had no sequel during the year. Treaties and Conventions. 76. Commercial Conventions. —The provisional commercial conventions between Egypt and the United Kingdom, and between Egypt and the Irish Free State, granting reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment, which have been renewed annually since the introduction of the new Egyptian customs tariff in 1930, were again renewed in 1934 for a further period of one year ending on the 16th February, 1935. 77. A provisional commercial agreement was concluded on the 11th October between Egypt and the Levant States under French mandate, whereby the contracting parties agreed, reciprocally, to the application of the most-favoured nation clause to the natural products and manufactures of each other. 78.

Egyptian Propaganda A broad. 86. There seems to have been less propaganda in 1934 than usual. What there was, was principally devoted to tourism : a special number of the Paris edition of the Chicago Tribune, and a weekly half-column in the same paper; also advertisements in the Times and other papers to attract tourists. 87. £E. 7,257 was spent in 1933-34 under the auspices of the Department of Coifimerce and Industry to boost the export of Egyptian oranges, with a result that about £E. 6,000 worth were exported. 88. There were Egyptian sections at the fairs at Salonica, Chicago and Marseilles. Chapter III. —Relations between Egypt and the Sudan. General. 89. Relations between Egypt and the Sudan continued to be satisfactory during the year 1934. There is little doubt that opinion in Egypt towards the Sudan has grown more realistic. This has been largely due to the visits paid by various distinguished Egyptians to that country who have returned greatly struck by the courtesy they received and the real facts of the situation which they had^ the intelligence to grasp. As an example of this may be cited Fuad Bey Abaza, the Secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society of Egypt, who in February last made a tour of cotton centres in the Sudan and elsewhere. On his return he told the public that many of their preconceived notions were false and especially with regard to the difficulties encountered in visiting the Sudan. He confessed also to his surprise at finding a large number of Egyptians still employed in the Sudan Government and also the presence of a considerable colony of Egyptians in Khartum. 90. As a result of speeches made in Khartum and in Cairo by Mr. Contomicalos, the President of the Khartum Chamber of C ommerce, efforts aie now being made to create an interest in the Sudan on economic grounds and with this end in view approval has been obtained for a16 . mission composed of members, of ^ f of the Royal Agricultural Society to visit the buda la|: J ur xhe Banque spot, possibilities of developmem, by fV l , branch there.

The hopes of an increase of trade between Egypt mentioned in last year’s report have been fully realised and a very considerable importation from the Sudan of dura, sesame, chillies and melon seed took place. As reported below the cattle and sheep trade showed signs of improvement and the camel traders had an exceptionally good yeai. According to the official trade statistics the exports from the Sudan to Egypt during the first ten months of 1984 were £E. 663,000, including no less than £E. 848,000 for dura, as against a total of £E. 291,000 in 1933. On the other hand, imports from Egypt into the Sudan, particularly sugar and cement, have also increased considerably though at present precise figures are net available. However, for the above-mentioned period total imports from Egypt (including goods in transit through Egypt) were £E. 701,000 while in 1933 imports of purely Egyptian origin totalled £E. 584,000. For the first ten months of 1934, of the total Sudan trade, 23 per cent, of the imports and 21 • 2 per cent, of the exports were from or to Egypt. 93. As reported in paragraph 81 of last year’s report the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture have apparently for some years past been making use of certain sanitary and quarantine measures in regard to the importation of cattle and sheep from abroad for protective purposes, i.e. with the object of making Egypt self-supporting in the matter of the provision of meat. This had serious conse quences for the Sudan cattle producers who formerly had a large trade with Egypt. In January the Prime Minister agreed to a suggestion previously made by the Residency at the instance of the Sudan Government that two represen tatives of the Egyptian and Sudanese veterinary services respectively should conduct an investigation into the whole question of the trade in cattle and sheep between the Sudan and Egypt—quarantine and traffic arrangements, marketing conditions, &amp;c. At the end of March the Sudan Veterinary Service submitted a* report which showed that the Sudan Government had obtained general satisfac tion on all points, excepting on the question of free pratique for sheep in regard to which they required that further representations should be made by the Residency. This question (i.e. the right to send sheep to be slaughtered anywhere in the country instead of being killed in quarantine) had formed the subject of a dispute the previous year between the International Quarantine Board at Alexandria and the Egyptian Veterinary Service, the former having declared free pratique for sheep in view of the absence of foot and mouth disease in the Sudan and the latter having threatened to arrest any such animals released from the Quai antine station. Although it was understood that the Sudan Government did not attach vital importance to the matter it was felt that it would be desirable t( J t \ ie cffiesG 011 up. In conveying to the Egyptian Government the thanks ot the Sudan Government for their co-operation in regard to the general question ol thn cattle trade between the Sudan and Egypt, the attention of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was drawn to the discrepancy in practice between the attitudes of the Egyptian authorities and the International Quarantine Board m re g ar( l to the question of free pratique for sheep, and the hope was expressed17 11 ,11 ' . , , ix/oo uut WiLli IIU success. 1L had recently been raised by the Sudan Chamber of Commerce and the High Commissioner accordingly requested that the Egyptian Government should wmsider a substantial reduction in these dues at an early date. In June the nme Minister replied that the two questions had been referred to the competent epartments, and in October he informed the Acting High Commissioner that alter careful re-examination of the question of free 'pratique for sheep the Egyptian authorities regretted that they were unable to modify their attitude. In view of the fact that it seemed clear that the Sudan cattle trade had benefited very considerably from the other modifications accepted by the Egyptian Govern ment, it was decided not to press the matter further for the time being. As regards the amount of the port dues at Alexandria the Prime Minister stated that this matter was being examined by a commission which he hoped would report in favour of a reduction. At the same time, in order to do everything possible to assist the Sudan cattle trade, arrangements had been made to suspend the collection of fees on Sudanese cattle and sheep at the veterinary station at Shellal. Oweinat. 94. During the course of 1933, as a result of air and land expeditions in the Libyan Desert, a party of Italians was discovered in occupation of the Wells at Ain Doua at Gebel Oweinat and Sarra which had always been regarded as lying within Sudanese territory. Conversations held in Rome with the Italian Government in December 1933 broke down as the Italian Government claimed not only Gebel Oweinat but all country west of longitude 27 and south to include even Merga. As this part of the frontier had never actually been delimited, in order to substantiate the Sudan Government’s claim in further conversations, instructions were given towards the end of the year for the Royal Air Force and the Sudan Defence Force to occupy Merga and Kharkour Mourr wells at Oweinat unless already held by the Italians. These instructions were duly carried out towards the middle of January under conditions of considerable difficulty. The Royal Air Force reconnoitred Merga Oasis on the 10th January and found it unoccupied. The Sudan Defence Force detachment arrived there on the 17th January and occupied the oasis the following day. The Royal Air Force reconnoitred Kharkour Mourr well on the 15th January and found a party of Italians in occupation. The Royal Air Force officer in charge here showed great initiative. Instead of returning and reporting failure he wirelessed back for permission to make a second reconnaissance on the ground that the Italian occupation had a temporary appearance. This Sir Miles Lampson at once granted and two days later the Royal Air Force landed in the neighbourhood and finding the well deserted, occupied it. The Sudan Defence Force took over on the 9th February. Owing to the risk of a leakage the Egyptian Government were not informed of the occupation until after it had taken place, when Mr. Yencken handed the Prime Minister a map showing the position and the Italian claims. Fortunately, Abdel Fattah Yehia was so preoccupied with a matter affecting his amour-propre that he failed to realise that he was being infoimed \ery muc after the event. a* A-PfAr emriA nrivate corresDondence between the Secretary of State and in the opposition press [11244]sacrificed to serve the wider policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and also that the Egyptian Government had not been properly consulted in regard to the settlement. -Economic and Financial Situation. State Finance. 96. The economic recovery which commenced in the autumn of 1933 was reflected in the revenue of the year 1933-34 : in spite of the remission of almost a million of direct taxation, that year ended with a surplus of £E. 1,081,000 on the State Budget and £E. 355,000 on the railway budget. 97. The budget of 1934-35 was over-conservative in estimating revenue at £E.36,236,000, actually less than the previous year’s estimate; at the end of the first six months of the financial year, receipts are better than the previous year’s by more than £E. 800,000. In budgeting for expenditure of £E. 36,693,931 (slightly less than the previous year’s estimate) the Government were able to provide no less than £E. 5,053,000 for new works, with the confident knowledge that the deficit apparent in the budget would not materialise. 99. The Reserve Fund stood on the 30th April last at £E. 30,375,560, of which 8^ million are engaged in various ways, 17^ are invested, and a little under 4 million are in cash. 100. The improvement in revenue enabled the Government in August to remove in some measure the bar on increases of pay and on promotions in the civil service which had been in force since 1931; and in December pensioners were relieved of half the stamp duty imposed on them in 1931 and 1932 with a promise that the other half will be removed in the budget of 1935-36. Concessions o a similai sort to serving officials are also under examination. atrrdHUnU n T steps ha T been durin g the y ear to relieve debtors on U - ■ / noI ' t g ;, g es : and an end was made of the arrangement with the “ e ronciere to buy up expropriated land with Government money • the 17 600 Fma'^ ^ ^ bemg mana S ed ^ a s P eclal motion of the 7 Ministry of jqoo 1 ?^ last of the Government’s stock of cotton purchased in the years caused 1 W oT 0° °V he 18 f h 0 1 cto 1 ber ’ Th ^ unfortunate venture 7 has against the Reserve hund In lIsAT* 24 Were deWted debited m 1931-32 and 1932 he reSt had been similari y Alexandria sold but not IJ n r T } ere 3 stll \ remams a stock of cotton at £E. 903,621 in the Reserve Fund 6 and Paid f ° r ’ whlch 18 re P resent ed by truce introduced at the^thne^of ba P 0 it an t changes in the customs tariff since the on the 20th November 1 of Uia^vear 6 T~ 1C r C ^ ferenCe m - 1933 was denounced rates have been raised on beiRtpn i i ^ further protection to local industry, to obtain an outlet for Ep-votian 8 ’ ' amp ^ a o Ses - an( ^ tar boushes : and, in order authorities to change the tariff thpr^ 106 111 b '? ria persuading the French basis which would favour the hiuh^mi^Tf 4r0Ip an Govern to a specific advantages were conferred on a few ^ ^ 11Ce ob -^STP^ compensating evading the inost-favourelnrtion daT^h 11 The co — method of followed. clause by specialisation of the schedule was production'as^l'esult'of the^extensioirof^ott 2011115 ' 116 ^' W ' th a decIine in local wheat-prices which the Government 6fd gr °.

In its simplest form the Egyptian Government’s case over the Public Debt can be stated as follows :— They claim («) that their legal liability in the contract is sterling and not gold, (o) that even if the courts do not uphold this view there can at least be no doubt that in equity the contract was a sterling and not a gold one. 108. On the 21st January, 1933, the Mixed Courts declared that the coupons and bonds of the Privileged, Guaranteed and Unified Egyptian Public Debts were payable in pounds sterling and in francs at the parity of gold. The tribunal, however, admitted the weight of the argument of equity and virtually extended an invitation to the parties to reach a settlement by dipiomatie means. 109. After some vacillation the Egyptian Government lodged an appeal which was set for the 16th November, 1933. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, however, suggested to the Egyptian Government that the international discussions begun in London and later continued in Paris should be given time to bear fruit, and as a result the Mixed Court of Appeal postponed the hearing on the 16th November and set the 13th February, 1934, as the date on which the Egyptian Government should submit their pleadings. 110. At the outset of 1934, therefore, the question of the payment of the coupons of the Egyptian Public Debt remained an urgent problem, failure to settle which might have awkward repercussions upon the position of the Caisse de la Dette, the Mixed Courts and the whole capitulatory regime. 111. In January His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom again pressed the Egyptian Government to seek, and the French and the Italians to agree, to a further postponement of the hearing of the appeal. On the 15th February the Mixed Courts adjourned the case until the 3rd May, setting the 15th April for the deposit of the Egyptian Government’s written arguments. The Credit foncier appeal was similarly adjourned. 112. The attitude of His Majesty’s Government was defined in Foreign Office despatch No. 132 of the 14th February in which the High Commissioner was instructed in effect to urge the Egyptian Government to send Bedawi Pasha to London and Paris to endeavour to reach some compromise with the French bondholders. To these instructions both the Financial and Judicial Advisers took strong exception. They considered it wholly wrong that the Egyptian Government should be expected to negotiate with one unimportant group of bondholders, and Sir Frank Watson, who felt his position keenly as Adviser to the Egyptian Government, was particularly opposed to any compromise involving payment in more than sterling. As a result of the correspondence which ensued the Secretary of State’s instructions were modified, and on the 5th April the High Commissioner handed the Prime Minister (Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha) an aide-memoire embodying paragraph 4 of Foreign Office despatch No. 132 of the 14th February as modified by Foreign Office telegram No. 72 of the 23rd March.113 This aide-memoire pointed out that while His Majesty’s Government had in no way departed from their view that it was equitable that Egypt should pay in sterling the Egyptian Government must undei stand that His Majesty s Government would not be able to give them the support which they wished to give them unless the Egyptian Government had exhausted every possibility of settling the matter by agreement. His Majesty’s Government therefore suggested that the Egyptian Government should ask them to arrange for a further conference of the representatives of the British, French and Italian and Egyptian Governments in Paris not later than the beginning of May. If the conference were arranged, the Egyptian Government would be expected to make use of the fact to secure a further postponement by the Court of Appeal. His Majesty’s Government would also insist that the Egyptian Government fully co-operate with them in presenting their case in such a way as to secure agreement with the French Government. His Majesty’s Government would regard it as in the best interests of Egypt to accept some compromise which would not involve any undue sacrifice of principle on the Egyptian side in order to reach agreement. If, however, the Egyptian Government could not be induced to accept any of the compromises suggested, the only remaining possibility would be to suggest to the French that arrangements in regard to gold clauses should in the first instance be made only for two or three years and should be subject to consideration between Governments thereafter. His Majesty’s Government regarded it as essential that the Egyptian Government should be prepared to go, at any rate as far as this, to facilitate agreement with the French. April the debt niv ueut cuupuiis snouiu oe pam m Sterling ana said tliat they shared His Majesty’s Government’s view that every effort should be made to settle the question bv agreement and thanked His Majesty’s Government for their help and support. In noting the suggestion regarding a temporary arrangement for sterling payments for two or three years, the Egyptian Government pointed out that they were not contemplating any compromise on the re-examination of the question at the end of the period, and completely reserved their attitude on this matter. in^vkAAfT^! 6 ’ in / ebruar y.

The French government, however, could not see their way to agree to this. A warning was therefore conveyed to the French delegation in a private discussion that His Majesty s Government would support Egypt in a refusal to pay more than sterling. Ihis warning was not given at the formal meeting owing'to Bedawi Pasha’s refusal to allow it to pass unchallenged as setting a possible limitation on the action to be taken by the Egyptian Government. Bedawi was, however, warned that measures which an adverse judgment might render necessary would, in fact, have to be concerted between the Egyptian Government and the Residency and that this decision would be published at what His Majesty’s Government might regard as an opportune moment. To this he did not demur.' 119. As Bedawi Pasha in Paris had suggested that the Egyptian Govern ment might withdraw their appeal, the High Commissioner, on instructions, sought and obtained an assurance from the Prime Minister that the Egyptian Government intended to prosecute the appeal vigorously. The Prime Minister, however, wished the appeal to be based on the grounds of the incompetency of the court. A meeting held in London and attended by Mr. Peterson, the Financial Adviser and the Judicial Adviser and other officials, including a representative of the Treasury, unanimously agreed that the appeal should be pressed on the merits of the case and not only, if at all, on the question of competence. When this was conveyed to the Prime Minister he agreed to fall in with His Majesty’s Government’s wishes, but said that the question of competence must also form part of the appeal. This meeting in London also discussed the possible ultimate implications of defiance of a gold judgment, which resulted later in frank state ments by Mr. Peterson to the Prime Minister and to M. Delacroix, who was considerably shaken on realising what might happen to the Caisse de la Dette. It also led to some plain speaking in Paris. 120. On the 8th September the Italian Minister addressed a note to the Prime Minister to the effect that, while maintaining their juridical attitude regarding payment in gold, the Italian Government were prepared to raise no objection to the conclusion of an agreement based on the Egyptian thesis and to bring all possible pressure on the Italian bondholders in this sense. This was taken, although the interpretation proved to be optimistic, to mean (1) that the Egyptian Government would be able to default against a gold judgment with the connivance of the Caisse de la Dette, whose decisions in paragraph 28 of the 1904 law are by the majority of the commissioners, and (2) that the prospect of having to suspend or even abolish the Caisse would be removed. 121. On the 14th September His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris, on instructions, addressed a note to the French Government asking them to reconsider their decision against the Egyptian proposal made at the governmental conference at Paris in June for a provisional settlement on a sterling basis for an agreed period. The note pointed out that in the event of a gold judgment the Egyptian Government would be bound to take unilateral action, and reminded the Frenc Government that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would not feel it right to offer any opposition to such action. Orally, a message was conveyed that this decision not to oppose such action implied that it would have the full support of His Majesty’s Government. In that event, the note added, the Caisse would be faced with the alternative of informing the Egyptian Government that it intended under protest, to continue to meet the service of the loans on a sterling basis as heretofore, in which case there would be no ground for altering the existing position of the Caisse, or it could refrain from giving such an assurance, [11244] C 3 ‘in which event the Egyptian Government would presumably cease to pay any part of the land revenues to the Caisse and would take steps to prevent the C aisse from drawing on its reserve fund and working balances for the purpose of making payments on a gold basis. His Majesty’s Government would prefer that the Caisse should continue to exercise its existing functions and they trusted therefore that if the French Government could not agree to this compromise His Majesty’s Government proposed that they would at least advise their representative on the Caisse to consent under protest to continue to meet the service of the loans on a sterling basis as heretofore. 122. In view of the apparent change in the Italian attitude, the Italian Government were merely informed of the substance of the above note to the French Government and invited to support the representations of His Majesty’s Government. 123. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had now come to the conclusion that two decree-laws to deal with the separate public and private debts would be preferable to a single comprehensive measure, and Mr. Peterson was authorised to seek the co-operation of the French and Italian representatives in Cairo, who were accordingly given copies of the draft decree-laws enclosed in Sir Miles Fampson’s despatch No. 446 of the 14th May. 124. At this stage, His Majesty’s Government, encouraged by the supposed Italian change of attitude and because of the obvious disadvantages of a temporary compromise as opposed to a permanent solution, made a further attempt to reach a permanent settlement by means of verbal representations to the French Government on the 14th and 29th September, of which the Italian Government were informed. M. de St. Quentin was also handed copies of the two draft laws referred to above. He hinted, however, that the French Government could scarcely be expected to accept a permanent, as opposed to a temporary, settlement so long as the pound sterling was not stabilised. The Italian Minister in Cairo now came forward and insisted that his letter to the Prime Minister of the Htb September was only an ‘ £ eclaircissement ” and meant nothing new He was supported by an official in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Rome, who said that the Italian Government had always maintained that from a iuridical point o view payment should be made in gold, but they were now prepared to recognise Hiffi™n CUraStanCeS ““ated payment in sterling.

A state of affairs identical with (e) but without the undertaking on the part of the Caisse de la Dette. u a ^ Fewfik Nessim Pasha’s Government in mid-November -ky— Wahab Pasha the portfolio of Minister of Finance and he at once made his influence felt against anything but a permanent settlement. On the bth December, the Prime Minister informed Mr. Peterson that the Council of Ministers considered that nothing short of a permanent settlement would be satisfactory to the Egyptian Government. On the 15th December Mr. Peterson, therefore, saw the Prime Minister and Abdel Wahab Pasha together and left with them a memorandum, the main argument of which was that no opportunity of of settling the question on a legal basis must be allowed to pass. In reply, Abdel Wahab Pasha claimed, though it had never before been mentioned, that the former Prime Minister had actually informed the French Charge d’Affaires that the Egyptian offer of a temporary settlement had been withdrawn. He there upon enumerated various objections to a temporary settlement and notably that it would block any conversion operation, which would be by far the cheapest investment for Egyptian surplus funds amounting to £E.2,500,000 to £E.3 million. 130. His Majesty’s Government considered, however, that it was impossible to withdraw the temporary solution unless and until the French Government had definitely refused it, as to do so would impair the equity of Egypt’s position. On the 22nd December, therefore, Mr. Peterson left a further memorandum with the Prime Minister and Abdel Wahab Pasha stating confidentially that His Majesty’s Government saw some reason to anticipate that the French Government would accept a protocol on the following lines : — (Protocol.) c&lt; The undersigned delegates of the Powers represented on the Caisse of the Egyptian Public Debt, being duly authorised by their respective Govern ment, declare that they accept the draft decree annexed hereto.” (Proce s-verbal.) ‘ ‘ At the time of the signature of the protocol of to-day’s date relating to the decree with regard to the Egyptian Public Debt, the undersigned representative of the Egyptian Government declares that his Government adhere to the view that payments of coupons should at all times be made on a sterling basis, but in a spirit of conciliation are prepared to propose at present a draft decree providing for payments on this basis for a period of three years. “The representatives of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and of the Royal Italian Government declare that they agree with the declaration of the Egyptian Government. “ The representative of the Government of the French Republic declares that his Government, while accepting the draft decree, reserve the right to propose a further conference between the Governments concerned for further consideration in the event of a serious fall in the value of steiling dumig that period.” 131. The draft decree-law referred to simply provided that the bonds and coupons of the Egyptian Public Debt would continue to be pain in sterling until a certain date tnree years ahead. 132. The aide-memoire made it clear that Flis Majesty’s Government recognised that the duration of the private debt decree must depend upon that governing the Public Debt and proposed that the two Governments should concert in drafting it as soon as possible.

Abdel Wahab Pasha for a while stuck his toes m and talked of resigning, but ultimately he gave way to force of circumstances. Economic T^jcco'ccv'y. 136. The economic recovery which in last year’s report was noted to begun in Egypt in the third quarter of 1933 has been continued uninterruptedly throughout the year. The index figure of wholesale prices, which had reached its lowest in May 1933, was 15 per cent, higher a year later and has continued to rise. 137. The base of this recovery was the large cotton crop of 1933-34 18,575,000 kantars), which was disposed of at prices which averaged 7 per cent, more than the prices of the previous year; exports for the year September 1933 to August 1934 were £E. 31 million, or 15 per cent, greater than for the corres ponding previous year; and imports were £E.28 million or 6 per cent, greater. The balance of visible trade improved in Egypt’s favour from £E. 250,000 m 1932-33 to £E. 3 million in 1933-34. 138. The usual symptoms of returning prosperity were not slow to reappear. 4,103 Egyptian pilgrims went to Mecca in January 1934, against 1,630 the previous pilgrimage. 12 per cent, more passengers are being carried by the railways than in last year. The note issue is larger by 2 per cent.; and comparing the first nine months of 1934 with those of 1933, the circulation of subsidiary coinage is greater by 6 • 4 per cent. 139. Recovery appears to be shared equally by the business community and the agricultural population. Transactions through the Bankers’ Clearing House are up 9 per cent, in numbers and 4 per cent, in values. The number of protested bills, which was 17,020 in the first eight months of 1933, has fallen to 13,510 in the similar period of 1934. Post Office receipts show an increase of 15 per cent. The imports of motor cars, lorries and chassis, in spite of the new taxation, are phenomenal: between January and August 1934, 2,326 have been imported of a value of £E. 312,000 as compared with 1,334 of a value of £E. 192,000 in the first eight months of 1933. 140. Several striking statistics show the widespread nature of the recovery among the masses of the farming population. The consumption of sugar has grown this year by more than 1,000 tons a month, or 12 per cent., while the imports of tea and coffee in the first eight months of the year have increased by 17 per cent, in value. Nothing illustrates better the improving position of the farmer than the 20 per cent, increase in the amount of money which he has been able to spend on chemical fertilisers. Both the Wakfs Administration and the Depart- ment of State Domains are finding the collection of rents much easier this year, Wheat Beans saidi ... „ baladi... Maize Sorgho 3 considerably greater.

Satisfactory as these numerous symptoms of recovery are, the position wnien existed before the crisis is far from having been restored : mortgage debtors m particular are not clear of their difficulties : for, in spite of the relief afforded to them by the Government’s arrangement of 1933 with the mortgage banks, only ^ e annil{ fl instalment due in January 1934 had been paid by the end of October. Particularly in the north of the Delta, where the ravages of cotton- worm affected the crop, arrears continue to accumulate. 142. The prospects of continued recovery are, however, good. All depends on cotton : the yield of 1934 is now officially estimated at 7,801,000 kantars, which is 774,000 less than in 1933; but the crop consists of almost 200,000 kantars more of the valuable long-staple varieties, and about a million less of Uppers, so that the total price to be received for it should show little falling off from last year’s, especially as prices are so far averaging higher than in 1933. Customs Tariff. 143. The Egyptian Government issued tariff amendments on three occasions during 1934, namely {a) on the 4th August, (b) the 3rd September, and (c) the 13th October. 144. The changes under (a) and (b) affected a number of agricultural and industrial products, which were either not connected with United Kingdom imports, or, where they were, did not introduce any radical increases. The changes made under (c) affected wines and are referred to in detail below. 145. On the 2nd August the Residency addressed a note to the Egyptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs requesting modifications to some twenty-two items of the existing tariff which were considered by the Board of Trade to interfere unduly with the United Kingdom trade. The Egyptian Government in a note of the 28th October stated that they were prepared to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in respect of six items, mostly of minor importance, whilst seven were still under consideration, but that in respect of the remaining nine they could not see their way to make any concession. The matter is, however, still under consideration and it is hoped that further concessions will be obtained notwithstanding the fact that since the expiry on the 16th February, 1930, of the old fixed tariff, the Egyptian Government have resisted all efforts to obtain any adjustment of duty of any appreciable value; except that referred to in the next paragraph. 146. Cyprus and Palestinian Wines. —After protracted and arduous negotia tions extending over two years on the part of the Residency, a modification in the customs duty on ordinary wines has been secured. The duty as fixed at item No. 158 of the schedule of February 1930, was 20 per cent ad valorem on wines produced exclusively from the fermentation of fresh grapes with an alcohol content not exceeding 13 degrees. On the 31st March, 1932, this was extended by the inclusion of wines made from raisins. On the 30th May, 1933 the ad valorem duty was qualified by a minimum duty of 12 milliemes per litre, ibis minimum had the effect of killing the importation of cheap Cyprus an Palestinian wines. It was also illogical inasmuch as, on wines below the price of 6 piastres per litre, the ad valorem duty rose above 20 per cent, m proportion as the wines became cheaper. The Cyprus authorities, therefore requested that the minimum duty of 12 milliemes under the ad valorem, duty of 20 per cent, be abolished and that the alcohol content be raised to 15 degrees The question was taken up with the Egyptian Government who at length decided to raise the alcohol contentto the former level of 15 degrees and, whilst maintaining the 20 per cent. a 4 m l 0 rem. duty, to reduce the minimum duty to 8 milliemes per htie, and create an excise duty of 6 milliemes per litre on locally made wines, produced from fresh Varies or raisins with an alcohol content not exceeding 15 degrees The Minister of Finance is however, empowered (under conditions which will be established in an Arrete ’ministeriel) to exempt from this excise duty wines manufactured locally from fresh grapes grown in Egypt.

The area under cotton cultivation, 1 P 732,000 acres, was some 73,000 acres less than in 1933.148 The Government’s first (November) crop estimate of 8 million kantors was lowered to 7 milHon in December, a revtsion presumably due to fuller appreciation of cotton-leaf worm ravages. 149. The estimated crop for this year compares with^.fiTS^KlO Ranters ^or The 19S4 cron however, contains some 200,000 extra kantars or ion rt tapie and it fs estSed that the value of the reduced crop wdl be approximate y the P same as that of the previous year The exceptionally high iSde w^so productive of crop losses in flooded basin areas calculated ^ ted before 200,000 kantars, as a considerable area of cotton lands were mu crops had either matured or been more than summarily first-picked. 150. Government Cotton Holdings.—The last bales of the raw cotton stocks held bv the Egyptian Government were disposed of during the year, ihe Govern- J OJ 1 ,■ PT? Q 1 rnillirm 151 Cotton Legislation.—On the 2nd August, the new cotton-mixing law to replace Law No. 4 of 1926 was signed by the King and published m the O fficial Journal of the 6th August. In the “note explicative sent to the General Assembly of the Mixed Court of Appeal, it is stated that the law is essential to preserve the good name of Egyptian cotton overseas. It quotes the decision of the International Cotton Congress held in Cairo in 1927 which urged exporters in Alexandria to abstain from mixing cotton on account of the serious prejudice which this practice raised against Egyptian cotton amongst spinners overseas. The note also states that during the 1922—23 season the stocks of Sakellarides in Alexandria between certain dates, amounting to roughly million kantars, received an increase of some 134,000 kantars which could only be accounted for by fraudulent methods adopted by the exporters. This is a reference to the spinners’ complaint that the exporters damp their cotton unnecessarily in order to increase weight. In reply to this accusation exporters state that (a) the cotton is exposed for long intervals to the sun between pick and press and loses some of its natural tensility through drying, and that (b) the damping process restores the original, natural weight and the tensility. The law stipulates that all bales of cotton received from the ginning factories or presses are to be marked indelibly with the name of the cotton contained in the bale. Eleven varieties are named in the law and any other variety other than these must be marked with the name of the particular variety and to carry, besides, the inscription “non-catalogue.” Bales containing mixed cotton are to be marked accordingly. This law was desired by spinners overseas and, provided its disposition can be effectively and honestly enforced, will no doubt be of benefit to them, but it has naturally found little favour with local exporting houses, by whom it is considered unnecessary and in any case difficult of application and not likely to lead to any sensible amelioration of the existing situation. They argue that the more respectable exporting houses are within the law in any case whilst the less scrupulous will always find means of circumventing the new regulations.

The draft decree concerning the regulations governing the local Bourse des Valeurs mentioned in paragraph 436 of the last annual report was promulgated on the 1st January. On the 15th January the Ministry of Finance issued “ Arretes ministeriels Nos. 2 and 3,” which laid down that the dispositions of the laws concerning the “ Reglement interieur de la Bourse des Valeurs ,, of both Cairo and Alexandria would remain valid, except where modified by the general regulations of the “Bourse des Valeurs” promulgated on the 1st January. 158. Alexandria Cotton Bourses .—During the year two ministerial “Arretes ” were published modifying the interior regulations of the cotton section of the Minet-el-Bassal cotton and cotton-seed spot market (a) regarding the method of dealing with certified cotton as regards sampling and claims for humidity, &amp;c., and (b) specifying the grades of cotton which may be delivered against Sakel and Ashmouni contracts. These decrees rendered necessary the issue of two collateral decrees modifying the regulations of the “Bourse des Marchandises” (Futures Market) in so far as they concerned the addition of the new modifications to the wording on the contract notes. Agricultural Mortgage Debts. 159. The three large mortgage institutions, the Credit foncier d’Pgypte, the Land Bank of Egypt and the Mortgage Company of Egypt, are still working under the arrangement made with the Egyptian Government in March 1933, whereby existing debts were consolidated and spread over a term of thirty-five years at reduced rates of interest. Although the position of debtors under this convention was much improved, it is disappointing that the efforts made to observe their engagements on the reduced basis were not more successful. The arrears on the annuity due the 1st January, 1934, amount to nearly 60 per cent, of the sum due. It is considered possible that the hope of another intervention by the Government, which is strongly advocated in the vernacular press, may be influencing the debtors to delay their payments. In certain northern distucts, cultivators sufiered greatly from the ravages of the cotton leaf worm, some lost 70 per cent, of their crop, and others only 10 per cent. But, in general, cultivators have benefited by the improvement in the economic situation, which as oun expression in fairly good prices for cotton, and higher puces for w ea , maize, and rice. Chambers of Commerce. 160. Egyptian .—As a result of Law No. 14 of 1933 concerning *e formation f Egyptian chambers of commerce in Egypt seven chambers have been formed o date at Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Fayoum, Beni Souef, Assiout and lansourah.161 Except for entertaining visiting commercial d fJ^ 0 ^’X C Japanese t ’ in flip TTnifpd Kingdom m connexion with the Angio-J apanese Japanese, who were m the United J^mgaom , bers of commerC e are not cotton negotiations, the activities of these Egypt f himincss Thev pronounced and little is heard of them m the ordinary course of business. Itiey are under strict Government control. 162 British —The activities of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt continued unabated, and during the year much the consideration of draft laws of interest to commerce. Information was given to enquirers from all parts of the world and United Kingdom firms were supplied with status information concerning local firms, and received advice regarding the appointment of agents. 163. The chamber gave a very successful luncheon to Sir Miles Lamp son on his arrival in Egypt which produced a record attendance. Subsequently the oiripri flip Iflfp Primp Minister and his colleagues m the Cabinet. 164. During the year the presidency of the chamber automatically reverted to Cairo for two years and Lieutenant-Colonel V. B. Gray became the new president. The chairmanship of the Alexandria section of the chamber passed at the same time to Mr. J. B. Barron. Register of Commerce. 165. A law instituting a “Register of Commerce” to be kept in each Governorate or Mudirieh was promulgated on the 12th July. Under this law all business houses, whether Egyptian or foreign, private or public companies, having their principal business or head office or a branch or an agency in Egypt, are obliged to supply certain details concerning their composition and operations to the appropriate Governorate or Mudirieh, where this information will be filed and become available to the public against the payment of certain fees. A central register for the whole of Egypt will be kept at the Department of Commerce and Industry in Cairo. Bank Misr. 166. This bank which began its operations in 1920 with a capital of £E.80,000 has to-day a capital of £E.l million and branches throughout the whole of Egypt. 167. The bank has two affiliated companies abroad, the “ Banque Misr- France ” with its head office in Paris and the “ Banque Misr Syrie-Liban ” with head office in Beirut and branches at Damascus and Tripoli. There is also a possibility of the bank extending its operations to the Sudan to encourage trade between Egypt and the Sudan. 168. Under the auspices of the Misr Bank the following companies have been floated and constitute the Misr group, viz :— (a) Misr Cotton Ginning Company. (5) Misr Cotton Exporting Company. (c) Misr Cotton Spinning and Weaving Company. {d) Misr Silk Weaving Company. (e) Misr Flax Company. (/) Misr Transport and Navigation Company (Fluvial navigation). {g) Misr Fishery Company. (h) Misr Airwork (Limited). {i) Misr Papermaking Company. (j) Misr Printing Works. (k) Misr Theatre and Cinema Company. {1) Suez Button Factory. (m) Misr General Insurance Company. (n) Misr Maritime Navigation Company. (o) Misr Tanning Company. (p) Misr Shipping Company (Tourist Agency, &amp;c.)• , 16 f‘ conc 1 er ? s are closely associated with British business interests. The Misr Airwork (Limited) ” with Airworks (Limited) the “Misr Tit I “ nce Q Company - with C. T. Bowring and Co. (Insurance), (Limited), (Limited) ^ 1Sr ^^ 11 PP in S Company with Messrs. Cox and Kings (Agents) 170. The Bank Misr claim to have made a profit exceeding £E.140 000 for the year 1933, and their general reserve, amounting, as it does, to £E.800 000 is nearly equal to the bank’s capital. Industrial Egypt as represented by this bank is undoubtedly endeavouring to run before it has learnt to walk, and many of the companies above mentioned will have a difficult row to hoe. Some, however, may eventually nourish and the country will be the wiser if not the richer for the experience thus gained. Chapter V.—General. The Capitulations. 172. The capitulatory regime remains as unpopular as ever amongst Egyptians of all classes. It is particularly galling to Egyptians to see that countries like China, Turkey and Persia have succeeded in throwing off capitulations while Egypt remains fettered by them. His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom are often blamed for their continued existence, on the ground that the international rivalries in Europe would enable Egypt to remove the yoke were it not for the presence of British troops in Egypt. 173. In existing conditions there is a divergence of opinion amongst Egyptians on the tactical methods to be adopted to end the system. The minority look for support from the League of Nations or some international body for the abolition of the whole regime, and concentrate on calling attention to the anomalies to which it admittedly gives rise, but refuse any offer of compromise which might remove them and so weaken their case. 174. The second school of thought—much larger in numbers—hopes to undermine the regime by making it uncomfortable for the Powers to retain it. This results in a series of pinpricks, some of which, relating to the Mixed Courts, are mentioned in paragraphs 220 to 228 of the present report. 175. In October the Government addressed a circular note to representatives of the capitulatory Powers regarding the Mixed Courts. The only specific demands made in this communication were those referred to in the paiagrap s mentioned, viz., the use of Arabic in the courts and the rights of Egyptian judges to preside a chamber of the courts. This note was, however, worded m an unnecessarily offensive manner. The Mixed Courts, which were ^ s&lt; q ri e essentially transitory in character, regarded themselves the note stated, as jealous guardians of capitulatory privilege m the legislative and judicial sphere Ind it was made clear that the two demands put forward were merely to be regarded as a temporary alleviation of the position pending the action which th Government proposed to take within a brief interval to abolish the reg which the Mixed Courts were a symbol. 176. The nature of the reply to be made to this ill-tempered and provocative note had not been decided at the end of the year. 177 Anv suggestion that the capitulatory regime may be modified evokes - -i™* - tsiSistSs sn&amp;lsX &gt;» srss K,S;” 'So will survender th.ir m&gt;ti«E “ willingly.

The situation was complicated by the vexatious restrictions imposed on motor traffic by the Egyptian Government to help the railways and to bring m revenue which were in contravention of capitulatory rights and were arbitrary and irresponsible. Though His Majesty’s Government did not do so other Powers made their willingness to agree to a tax dependent upon the cessation ot these measures. 180. In July 1933 the Egyptian Government sent a circular note to the Powers enclosing the text of a draft law. His Majesty s Government replied on the 25th October, 1933, agreeing to the law with certain modifications, and provided the other capitulatory Powers agreed. The other Powers were very dilatory, and the Residency finally exerted influence upon them, pointing out that, as the Egyptian Government were aware that the Powers were agreed in principle that a motor tax might be imposed, merely holding matters up by failure to reply did not show the capitulatory regime in a very good light. All of the replies, however, were not received until March 1934, nearly eight months after the Egyptian Government’s note had been received. 181. On the 23rd May Bedawi Pasha produced a new draft law and draft notes to the Residency and the other Powers, and asked the Director-General, European Department, to consult the Residency privately. It was found, however, that some of His Majesty’s Government’s essential conditions, notably non-retroactivity, and the unrestricted issue of licences to private transport and distributing services working without reward, had not been adopted. Steps were taken to secure the adoption of these essential conditions, upon which the consent of the French and Belgians also depended, as well as of certain minor ones. 182. The United States Government meantime insisted that the Egyptian Government should accept their view that the restrictions on the issue of licences made in the interests of traffic, public security and public health would not be unreasonable. 183. On the 13th June the Ministry for Foreign Affairs issued the redrafted circular note enclosing the text of the draft law establishing the fiscal regime which it was proposed to apply to motor vehicles. The Residency, on instructions, replied on the 26th June, accepting the terms of these notes and the provisions of the Bill as satisfying the conditions on which, as set forth in the Residency note No. 341 of the 24th October, 1933, His Majesty’s Government were ready to give their assent to the application of the proposed law to British subjects. His Majesty’s Government presumed, however, that the Egyptian Government had not lost sight of the requirement set forth in paragraph'? of the Residency note of the 24th October, 1933. His Majesty’s Government also renewed their position as regards the eventual charges for the use of specially constructed motor roads and for special parking facilities. His Majesty’s Government further noted that the dues levied by the municipalities, by the Roads and Bridges Administration, and by the Egyptian State Railways had been suppressed, these, as stated in the Ministry s circular note of the 31st July, 1932, being comprised, along with the fees in respect of the examination and supervision of motor vehicles, m the tax instituted by the Bill before Parliament. His Majesty’s Government also safeguarded their position as regards possible claims by British subjects for a refund of payments which, in the view of His Majesty’s Govern ment, they had been wrongfully induced to pay. 184. The Egyptian Government acted with remarkable promptness, and the asUawNo^rof 1934 arliament forthwitl1 ’ and promulgated within a few days f 'A Meanwhile a memorandum had been received by the Foreign Office Motor Manufacturers and Traders in the United Kingdom, ensnrl rtf? rt.T to ° late to interfere with the law itself, steps were taken to careful considerntiff P ' lan over,iment should give the society’s memorandum careful consideration in connexion with the practical operation of the law.the motor trade^nd'framTfo f ^ Uw br ° Ught forth vocif Mous protests from also resulted in a strike of /n T commu “ t y unaccustomed to pay taxes.

Ihere were some indications at the end of the year that the Egyptian authorities were beginning to realise this, though whether they will be able to bring themselves to make the reductions which common sense demands remains to be seen. 189. Land Tax. In the summer the Minister of Finance took the initiative m stiffening up the collection of land tax from Members of Parliament and provincial councils. Sending for Mr. Holden, of the Direct Taxes Department, he told him that there were reports that large sums were owing and asked him for a list. Mr. Holden accordingly produced one showing that a very consider able part of the £E. 400,000 arrears of land tax outstanding from the autumn instalments was owed by Members of Parliament and provincial councils. 190. According to law, if an instalment of tax is not paid forty days after it is due, a seizure is to be put on the produce of the land concerned or the animals used to work it, and after forty days of seizure a forced sale is made. 191. The practice, however, during the last three years, has been to postpone the sale a further seventeen days for anyone who paid up a quarter of what was owed. Another fifteen days again on payment of a quarter of the balance, and so on. 192. This practice had the sanction of the Ministry, but the mudirs dared not apply it to the people’s representatives. The Minister of Finance, however, issued direct instructions to all mudirs to enforce the rules recently practised without fear or favour henceforward. 193. Dr. Hafez Afifi suggested that all persons who owned less than 5 feddans should enjoy complete exemption from land tax, and that anyone owning from 5 to 20 feddans should pay land tax on a sliding scale. Ihe Acting Financial Adviser, however, was not enthusiastic about any attempt to reassess the tax, maintaining that, while the 1904 law remained intact and the land tax remained a bondholder’s security, it were better for Egypt s credit that it should be left alone. 194. Taxation of Posters .—A draft law to control the display of advertising posters was compiled last September. The main provisions of the original i a t were that no advertisement, placard or poster should be exhibited on monumen s, churches (or within a radius not exceeding 100 yards of such places), gardens trees, lamp-posts, telephone poles, kiosks, letter-boxes, traffic signals and other constructions of public utility or value. A person wishing to advertise should make an application on stamped paper, pay PD 10 w droits d examen to cover the cost of the inspection of the proposed site of the advertisement pay a rfrOT de timbre of 30 millibmes and an annual droit of an unspecified fixed F at ® exceeding PT. 15 for each square metre of surface of the adveitisement. Luminous signs on roofs and balconies were to be permitte 195 This draft law was considered to be in every way unfortunate. It was maintained by the Acting Judicial Adviser th F P“?v gr OT nwmarf ancient monuments from billposting appeared to be unnecessary or 14 neces inadequate, and that the real idea behind the law was to obtain a Iresh source of income for the Treasury.32 196. Largely owing to the efforts of the Acting Judicial Adviser, the draft law was modified and a further project elaborate . 197. The new project was mainly directed to the ‘j 1 ® S jf C ^e or suspension of advertising matter directly on bull xngs w ()Ut i nvo ] V ing sort of framework, and the creation of mechanism fo c J o framework the issue of licences for the construction and maintenance of this framework. The licences were to be issued after a fee of FT. 20 for the on been paid, while an annual sum of FT. 5 per square metre was to be imposed on each advertisement permitted. 198. Although the new project appeared to be more reasonable tha n theJAst draft law, the proposals for obtaining licences were again subject to cnt 3 _ It was held by the Residency that the Egyptian authorities were entitled to exercise reasonable control over the disfigurement not merely of historical sites but also of public highways. On the other hand, however, the fiscal clauses ot the draft were considered to be a thinly veiled attempt to impose taxation on foreigners without direct application to the capitulatory Powers, hrom e point of view of the commercial secretariat, it was considered a handicap to trade. The matter was accordingly referred to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary ot State for Foreign Affairs, who decided that the legal point involved should be left to the decision of the Mixed Courts, and that the Residency should not int.Arvpnp in the matter. 199. Patents Tax .—The Egyptian Government appear to have dropped the projected patente tax, doubtless in view of the opposition of all the principal capitulatory Powers. Nothing further has been heard of this project since the end of 1933. 200. Taxation of School Buildings .—March the Municipality of Alexandria endeavoured to insist on the payment of the built property tax on the residential portion of St. Andrew’s School. Mr. Heathcote-Smith resisted this demand, which he maintained was contrary to article 2 of a decree of the 13th March, 1884, stipulating that establishments, such as mosques, churches, convents and places devoted to works of charity, should be exempt from taxation. The lawyers of the Alexandria Municipality contended, on the other hand, that the residential part of St. Andrew’s School was not a building devoted to charity, and that taxation should be paid on it. 201. The Judicial Adviser admitted that the opinion given by the municipal lawyers was sustainable, but that support for Mr. Heathcote-Smith’s view was to be found in a note which the Finance Committee had sent to the Direct Taxes Department on the 14th September, 1887. In that note it was held that apart ments occupied by the priests of a church and by the sacristan respectively should be exempt from the property. He therefore maintained that, if this opinion was correct, all accommodation occupied by the paid staff of an exempted institution should be tax free. 202. Since the dissolution of the Alexandria Municipal Commission the question has not been pursued further. British Education and Culture. 203. In November, 1933, Sir P. Loraine addressed a comprehensive despatch to the Foreign Office expressing the opinion that, in view of the intense activities of French and Italian educational establishments in Egypt, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom must re-examine the whole problem of maintaining and developing English education and culture in this country unless the political and commercial futures of Great Britain were to be irremediably compromised. He considered that the time had come for a reversal of His Majesty s Government’s traditional policy of abstaining from any concerted effort based on adequate financial support to maintain and develop English educational and cultural positions in foreign countries. He suggested that the problem as far as Egypt was concerned, should be dealt with under the following heads : ’33 [11244] (1; r ^^g c ^^|^ m ^ nance English in the Egyptian Government secondary IS ^ n SEsh elements in the Egyptian University. (3) British schools. (4) A British university. (5) British library of information. (6) Cinema. £) development of boy scout movement under British direction. /m Encouragement of distinguished British lecturers in Egypt. /id Eormation of Anglo-Egyptian cultural and social societies. ( 10 ) W ireless propaganda. (11) Spreading of British influence in the Jewish community. (12) Encouragement of Egyptian students in the United Kingdom. The Foreign Office replied in February that while certain of Sir P. Loraine’s proposals were already being dealt with through the medium of Sir Evelyn Wrench's organisation, the All People’s Association, while others, such as the suggestion for the establishment of a British University in Cairo, were incapable of realisation at the present time, there was scope, provided financial support were obtainable, for development of real importance on the lines proposed. They sta.ted that after consultation with the Board of Education they proposed to lay before the Treasury a concrete programme of educational development which both deserved and needed assistance from public funds. They outlined proposals under the first, second, third and last of the above headings and asked the High Com missioner to furnish his views thereon. The High Commissioner was also instructed to set up a small non-official body capable of advising on all questions of educational and cultural development and he was informed that it was proposed to advocate to the Treasury the despatch to Egypt of an educational mission which should consist of three experts covering the whole educational field, such as a University Vice-Chancellor, a secondary school master and a Board of Education inspector. The local committee should be in a position to supply the maximum of information on the points to be covered by the investigation. 204. The Educational Advisory Committee was duly constituted, under the chairmanship of Mr. G. A. W. Booth, the Judicial Adviser, as follows : — Sir Robert Greg, K.C.M.G. Mr. W. A. Smart. Mr. J. B. Barron. Mrs. P. G. Elgood. Mr. H. L. d’A. Hopkinson (Secretary). The committee, which held its first meeting on the 2nd June, drew up some preliminary observations, which were communicated to the Foreign Office, welcoming their proposals and recommending inter alia that the educational mission should arrive in Egypt not later than the following March. Owing to the absence of many of its members from Egypt the committee was unable to meet again until the 19th November. 205 In the meantime the Foreign Office submitted to the Treasury proposals contemplating an annual expenditure of a sum of £25,000 on educational develop ment in Egypt. They estimated that some £15,000 per annum would be devoted to the assistance of British schools in Egypt, £5,000 per annum to improving the prospects and quality of British professors and £5,000 per annum to the purposes affecting British teachers in Egyptian schools and Egyptian students m the United Kingdom. 206 Five meetings of the committee were held before the end of the year and the committee had an opportunity of hearing the views of Mr. Grose, the Headmaster of the English School, Cairo, Mr. Martin the Principal of the Fnhish Mission College, Cairo, and Mr. Reed, the Headmaster of Victoria n if„r a Wondria Arrangements were made to hold meetings shortly after the New Year at which His Majesty’s consul-general at Cairo and His Majesty s consrd-general at Alexandria siUld be py-nt. The mam question dealt with Hp above meetings was the position of BntisJi scnoois m i^gypt and it wa^ proposed 8 to submit £ full report on this subject towards the middlTof January, leaving the other matters to be dealt with lateron. It34 emwged very clearly whether 1 3^11^^ in Egypt in rp“TnyE;i.?h% l Sn^«d E SuiiSg“C s ^'“&amp;.aiZsKiar=sj=^S KrS best English girls' public schools, preferably at Alexandria whlc ?\ *^ ld F a “,f h girls belonging to families of the governing class and should provide that Eng s education and atmosphere which was available to boys at Victoria Loliege a which in the harem was completely lacking. Some funds for this project, whic had incidentally been under examination in Alexandria for some six years^ already existed and it was felt that with the assistance of a grant from His Majesty s Government and, if possible a free site, it would be possible to raise suflicient money from British and Egyptian sources to achieve practical results in ttie 207. While the discussions were still in progress it was announced by the Secretary of State, in reply to a parliamentary question, that provision was being made in the estimates for the budget for a grant towards the formation of the school. A despatch was subsequently received from the Foreign Office informing the Residency that the Treasury had decided to authorise a capital contribution towards the school of £10,000 provided that sufficient funds could be raised from other sources to enable the school to be founded. As regards the other proposals, the Treasury could not see their way to agree to the expenditure on the scale proposed. Nor were they able to agree, in the absence of further information, to the expense involved in sending an educational mission to Egypt. They did not, however, close the door to the possibility of the despatch of such a mission, nor of some further assistance to British schools in Egypt. As regards the proposal for assistance to British teachers in Egyptian schools they drew attention to the fact that the main difficulty in obtaining a flow of adequately qualified British teachers in Egyptian schools lay in securing their re-employment on their return to England. Pending further information on this point they could not agree to a grant to supplement their salaries. The Treasury saw grave objection to the proposal that public funds should be used to increase the emoluments of British professors at the Egyptian University as was done by several other foreign countries. They pointed out that the British University system was on a different basis to that in many other countries and did not lend itself to such an arrange ment. Imitation of such a policy might lead to undesirable competition and, in their opinion, the use of public funds in this way would give rise to considerable criticism in Parliament. As regards the position of Egyptian students in the United Kingdom they stated that, according to information received by them, the number of Egyptian students in the United Kingdom was already such that no assistance was necessary. 208. Although this result was naturally disappointing, the committee is continuing its enquii ies with a view to the submission of a comprehensive report in the near future. In the meantime consideration is being given to the practical steps to be taken with a view to the early establishment of the girls’ school at Alexandria. British Educational Establishments. 209. The number of pupils at all the principal British educational centres has again shown an increase; Victoria College, the British Boys’ School and the Scottish School for Boys at Alexandria and the English School and the English ission College at Cairo having all increased in numbers. Finance still continues £’ b ® a ProMem, particulaHy in the case of the English School, Cairo, which was been^evincei?

About a third of the pupils are Maltese, the remainder being divided up among English, Cypriots, Greeks, Armenians, Jews and Egyptians. .Scottish School for Boys, Alexandria. —'The number of pupils has risen • t0 ^ maximum that can be handled at present is 250. Although the most rigorous economy is still necessary, the headmaster has been able to pay the staff slightly higher salaries and has succeeded in balancing his budget. About 40 per cent, of the pupils are Jews of whom 20 are educated practically free. 213. The English School, Cairo. —As stated above, the school showed a deficit of about £E. 1,200 on the school year ended the 30th September. It was found possible to meet this without external assistance by utilising a previous donation of Mr. Birley of Alexandria towards a deficit on the hostel at Helwan and part of a sum of money which was received unexpectedly in connexion with the winding-up of the ex-German Mission Property Trust. The possibility of some change in the character of the school which would improve its financial position— e.g., the admission of Egyptians—is under consideration by the Educational Advisory Committee (see paragraph 206) though this proposal is strongly opposed by the headmaster, Mr. Grose. 214. The English Mission College, Cairo. —The number of pupils is now nearly 500 and no less than 29 different nationalities are represented among the children. There are about 10 per cent. British subjects (including genuine English children and Maltese), about 20 per cent. Egyptians, 10 per cent. Syrians, a good many Armenians, some Greeks, Jews, Austrians, &amp;c. With the assistance of from £800-£l,000 raised in England and some £500 raised in Cairo, the school was able to cover its annual expenses of about £E. 7,000. Some £E. 10,000 are required for the erection of new buildings—a boys’ college and a girls’ college—on the site at Koubbeh acquired last year. Mr. Martin, the headmaster, contemplates launching an appeal for funds in the near future and, as the lease of the old buildings at Faggala expires in May 1936, the matter is one of some urgency. Administration of Justice. 215. Central Organisation.—Dmmg the greater part of the year Ahmed Aly Pasha remained Minister of Justice. While he could always be relied on to give an honest opinion and carry out (as far as he was capable) his undertakings, his rather inert character and slow-moving wit were far from making him the ideal person to cope with the difficult and delicate problems which aiose m WkJX -A-W. — -JL v_^ # _ , 91 fi Mohammed Taher Nour Pasha continued to fill, without incident, the [11244]36 harmonious collaboration with Mr. ^‘ he be ascribed to any farlure to “ play up ” on his part. . , . ^ Mr Payne in spite of the difFicnities inevitably pressing on t e as Fnnlishman left in the parquet, has continued to do good work m his Departm , amfhS™rented for himse?f aposrtron such that ^ influence in matters connected with the Native Courts X r ® n a severe and unexpected loss in the death of Zaki . Ha ™p, most whom both the late Mr. Hughes and Mr. Payne himself had reposed tne most imnlicit confidence and who had refused the offer of a post as mudir of a province rather than leave them. By a stroke of good fortune a ^ ossi “ e himself in the person of Mohammed El Sayed Shahme Bey of the Minister of Justice, whose appointment was agreed to by Ahmed Aly Fasha with some not unnatural reluctance at losing the most capable member of his personal staff. The work of the Native Courts Parquet was, on the whole, carried out with comparative efficiency, but though the improvement in the relations between the parquet and the police, noted m last year s report, was at least maintained, there were still indications that the parquet and the police work in water-tight and slightly hostile compartments. The work of the Medico-Legal Section, now entirely in Egyptian hands, also provided occasions for anxiety, more narticularlv in recent months. 219. Abdel Hamid Badaoui Pasha continued to be president of the State Legal Department, and his influence becomes ever more dominant in a committee becoming less and less willing or competent to oppose his views through the gradual absorption into ministerial office of its more independent Egyptian members. 220. Mixed Courts.—The Mixed Court of Appeal suffered a great loss in the death of Judge A. C. McBarnet, C.B.E., in February, a gentleman of fine character and a tremendous worker. He had served a long apprenticeship in the Native Courts before his appointment to the Mixed Court of Appeal in 1920. He was succeeded by Judge Murray-Graham of the Cairo Court of First Instance, and the resulting vacancy was filled by the appointment of Judge Julian Mignon De Freitas, from Palestine. Judge De Freitas was, with his consent, and with the approval of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, appointed to the First Instance Court of Mansourah, in spite of the usage under which judges of the major Powers are appointed either to Cairo or Alexandria direct. This is the second acceptance by an English judge of an appointment to Mansourah, and it will serve as a useful example without, however, weakening the principle. All the major capitulatory Powers except the United States have now agreed to appointments in the 'Mansourah Court as an exceptional circumstance, with advantage to the public service. 221. Another serious loss to the Mixed Court of Appeal has been the retirement during the long vacation of Judge Vryakos, of Greek nationality, an eminent jurist especially expert in criminal law. He rendered valuable assistance in elaborating the recently prepared draft Gode of Criminal Procedure. He was succeeded by Judge Vlachos, the senior of the Greek judges of first instance, but by no means the equal of the man whose place he has taken. The resultin 0, vacancv m first instance has not yet been filled. ^ 2 . me construction of the new court-house at Port Fuad having been at last computed the long-promised appointment of the first Austrian judge since , , 4 T as I,ia '! : t0 ffll a new P ost necessitated by the permanent delegation to Port Fuad of a magistrate from the Mansourah Tribunal.

He retorted by offering a batch of nresiVont * Arabic, a language of which his European coUeagues and his not ontv t tW bi &gt;raCtl0a -!b- lg k° ral?t V Confusm g th e issue, he thereupon claimed , Vi ‘ _ ■ ' , l was within his rights in making such a useless contribution to shonlH h™f dellb eration, but that he was entitled to insist that his Arabic drafts should be delivered as the judgments of the court. 225. Egyptian Claim to Presidency of Chambers.—At about the same time u arising out of an incident in the Cairo Court of First Instance, there was a renewal of the old claim that the Egyptian conseillers and judges should be recognised as eligible for the presidency of chambers. It was claimed that nothing m the existing law prevented their being admitted to preside, and the Egyptian judges of first instance, with the honourable exception of Judge Keldany of Alexandiia, declared their intention of refusing to sit unless the claim were recognised in a particular case. Means were found, not without trouble, of avoiding the carrying into execution of this threat—somewhat to the relief of the judges concerned. The question was formally considered by the General Assembly of the Court of Appeal, which recorded the opinion that there were Egyptian judges capable of presiding chambers, but rejected the claim on the ground that it is contrary to the existing “ reglements ” properly interpreted. This rejection made a second source of public grievance, and the two questions were taken up violently by the Arabic press and welded into a weapon for a strong attack on the Mixed Courts generally. The outcome of it all was the note which was addressed by the Egyptian Government to the capitulatory Powers in October, and which is now under reply. There was also much agitation amongst the members of the Chamber of Deputies. 226. Mixed Court Assemblies. —Difficulties also arose between the Mixed Courts and the Government on the subject of legislation. The necessity of reference to the Mixed Court Assemblies under article 12 of the Mixed Civil Code, and the decree of the 1st January, 1889, is galling to present-day Egyptian amour- propre, and feeling on the subject was aggravated during the past year by the rejection of a draft law on commercial pledge (“ Gage mobilier ”). This draft was referred to the Legislative Assembly under article 12, and rejected on the grounds of its inadequate legal safeguards and of the absence of any real demand for it. 227. Badaoui Pasha, for the Egyptian Government, claimed that the Mixed Legislative Assembly had no right to do this, but must confine themselves to seeing that the rights of foreigners were not infringed. While disagreeing in toto with this thesis, the Judicial Adviser is inclined to think that the Mixed Courts have recently shown some lack of conciliatory spirit in dealing with measures submitted to them. It must, however, be remembered that legislation has become more voluminous and more complicated of late years, and that the Mixed Court judges have not the time or the equipment for the role of legislators on an important scale Some part of the difficulties may be ascribed to self-protection on the part of these unwilling legislative referees. It is not improbable that the present Government may seek to approach the Powers with proposals on this subject, as was the intention of the late Government. 228 The case of the claim of a number of former Government officials of foreign nationality to opt for payment of their pension in gold francs was heard in December and gave rise to a somewhat surprising judgment by the Cairo Court of First Instance to the effect that the court was incompetent, and calling upon the Government to find some other means for the plaintiffs to submit their claims to judicial decision. 299 Native Courts .—In the native courts, Abdel Aziz Fahmy Pasha continued to fill the post of president of the Court of Cassation with distinction S suite of long periods of ill-health. The Native Court of Appea m Cairo lost its President in October, when Amin Anis Pasha was made Minister of Justice^ A successor has not yet been appointed. The Assiout Court of Appeal is piesi e by Itribi Aboul Ezz'Bey. ^ 3 [11244]230. The work of the native betrg'y t4tabfe particularly m criminal matter 18 h d i ness 0 f the the assize courts to to two distinct tendencies. The a p ract ice which leads to adjourn cases for long periocs an w q evidence of the same witness at interference The second is the increasing different stages of the p ,,. n „Li n f serious crimes and even of murder are frequency with whmh persons ■ tendency has the same result as granted bail or set ^Kcred ^e opportunity ofTntimidating or bribing the persons who afe'to give evidence against him. Many acquittals must be ascribed to one or both of these two causes. 231 Perhaps the most unsatisfactory of these cases was the acquittal of the persons accused of the murder of Apocrate Petro, a Greek Ivazir. 232 Sharei Courts.-lhe Sharei Courts did nothing during the year to increase the confidence of Egvptians or foreigners m their efficiency or integrity. The strict application of Koranic law to cases where the husband of a Christian woman turns Moslem nearly led to another flagrant injustice m the summer, which wa“onlv avoided by the courage of the Minister of Justice, who found a technical means of preventing the Sharei tribunal from hearing the case In this instance, the husband had reverted to Christianity after five months of Islam and was living happily again with his wife and two small children when some sheikh, armed with the Koran, claimed to take the children away from the happy home and place them in an institution. Such cases as this show the necessity of the reform of personal status jurisdiction. This matter is referred to in greater detail in ■nnrficrra.nh 826. 233 Native 5^.—The Native Bar controversy referred to in last year’s report culminated in the passage of a law in July dissolving the Bar Council and creating a new committee to carry on the more urgent of its duties pending the modification of the Organic Law, which it was intended to introduce in Parliament in the autumn. This was rendered necessary by the continued refusal of the Bar to hold new elections to replace the members elected to the council in 1933 who had been excluded by the Law 86 of that year. The new body consisted of the procureur general and the president and one other judge of the Court of Appeal. The similar situation in the Sharei Bar was met at the same time by a decret-loi. suspending its council and creating a temporary committee of four members of the Supreme Mehkemeh Sharei to carry on temporarily in the same way. As soon as the Nessim Government came into power it abrogated Law 86 of 1933 and the corresponding law applicable to the Sharia Bar, and fixed a date early in 1935 for the holding of new elections, but maintained the temporary committees in the interval. Legislation. 234. Although the volume of legislation has been greater in 1934 than in 1933, there is little of importance and a large number of the new enactments passed merely effect minor amendments in existing laws. The same divisions of legislation as were adopted last year have been adhered to. 235. Economic Legislation .—In this sphere, the enactments which attracted most attention were the law (No. 44) and “ arretes ” concerning the long-awaited motor-car tax. Much protest was made as to the high rates of taxation, and a strike of taxi-drivers in Alexandria was only called off on a promise by the Government to rearrange the rates of tax applicable to their vehicles, which has since been done. In spite of gloomy prognostications, the law now seems to be functioning satisfactorily. ^36. The law mentioned in paragraph 151 prohibiting the mixture of cotton (No. 51) is designed to put a stop to the sale of cotton which is a mixture of two or more varieties, except under a mark which clearly specifies it to be mixed. This is a complementary law to that passed in 1926, which aimed at preventing the mixture of cotton by the producers. It was found that the export of mixed cotton persisted, and this law is designed to prevent mixing of cotton after it leaves the hands of the growers.[11244] 39 237. Another law (see paragraph 165) which had been awaited some time was that instituting a Register of Commerce (No. 46). This established registers of all companies, firms and individuals carrying on business in Egypt, both in the mudiriehs, and governorates, and also in the Central Department of Commerce and Industry. A search of the registers can be made by any person on payment of a small fee, and there are penalties against persons carrying on business without being inscribed on the register. 238. Other legislation under this heading worthy of mention is the decree of the 14th January establishing a council for the improvement of the milk industry; the law (No. 12) reducing the proportion of agricultural rents recoverable to 70 per cent, of the real rent for a further year (1931-32); and four decrees regulating the excise duties on alcohol and playing-cards, and instituting a duty on Egyptian wines. 239. Social and Administrative Legislation .—The output here is very meagre. The most important is the “ decret-loi” which was promulgated at the very end of December, modifying the decree of 1890 and reorganising the Municipality of Alexandria in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of Enquiry. This enactment and the events which led up to it are mentioned in paragraph 240. A new law was also passed reorganising provincial councils. This law replaces the old “Loi organique ” of 1913, and establishes in each mudirieh a new type of provincial council partly elective and partly nominative in place of the old elected councils, the nominated members being representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, Interior (Public Health), Education, Public Works and Communications. 241. The council’s functions become mainly advisory and consultative, and the Government can override or dictate to it on many matters, but certain powers are retained as to the provision of elementary education (sections 6 and 7), the encouragement of industry (section 8), and also the control of the ghaffirs of the mudirieh (section 14). Its approval is necessary for the change of name of towns and villages, and for the framing of local regulations for them. The mudir presides over the council, which must now meet at least once a month. 242. Next in importance is the law (No. 40) ££ reglementant les ecoles libres.” The title is misleading for the expression ££ ecoles libres ” is defined in section 1 as including every private school preparing principally pupils for the public examinations of the Ministry of Education. All such schools are by this aw submitted to the control and inspection of the Minister, and no new school can be opened without his approval (section 4). Educational and moral standards are Md down for the teaching staff, and by sections 12, 13 and 14 the Minister is ±c^.lv* D r. , „ nT'Adtprl for thfi rmrnose. by the Ministry’s inspectors at any time, and the closure of a school may be ordered. Although this law was promulgated m June it has not yet received the approval of the Mixed Courts and is not therefore applicable at present to schoo maintained by foreigners. 243. Other legislation worthy of mention includes the ■nnn t 1a« Dnnrses des Valeurs,” which became law on the last day of 1933 but was not mentioned in last year’s report, and the decree approving the statutes of the “Comite national des Sports,” which was placed under the patronage of the Egyptian Government. 244. Legal.—Th.QVQ are a series of minor enactments as to legal matters, the chief of which are as follows: • 245 ££ Arrete ” of the 16th April transferring the site of the mixed tribunal at P^t Said to Ik new building at Port Fuad across the Canal. 246. Law of the 28th June ah7fpafty “ The dTsposlknsof th.s law are not to interfere with or supersedethe provisions of the codes as to ££ Pension alimentaire” (z.^. article 437 Code de Procedure indigene and 499 Code de Procedure mixte). This measure is open to obvious criticism, but was desired by the Ministry of Wakfs and by Parliament. 247. Law of the 28th June amending the Law No. 4 of 1905 instituting courts of assize, to enable defaulting accused persons to be convicted by default in the same way as is done in the correctional tribunals. 248. Law No. 45 of the 5th July instituting consular tribunals in countries where Egypt has a right to exercise jurisdiction. At the moment, only Abyssinia comes within the scope of this law. The law to be applied in such consular courts is that of the native courts, and appeal is to the Native Court of Appeal in Cairo. 249. Legislation Pending .—Much important legislation is still pending, among which may be mentioned the laws on copyright, trade marks, assurance companies, and the municipalities (excluding Alexandria). 250. The proposed reform of non-Moslem Statut Personnel Courts received further consideration during the year. The draft Organic Law was discussed at four meetings of the Consultative Committee and progress was made. A draft new code was also made for application by the civil courts in cases reserved to them, but this has not yet been examined. Nile Control. 251. {General .—The Nile flood of 1934 presented certain peculiarities distinguishing it from previous high floods of which there are records. It was generally an early flood, the first rise was early and the fall from the maximum levels in the principal contributory sources, namely, the Blue Nile and the Atbara was early and abrupt. The level reached at Wady Haifa was the highest recorded since 1890, but in neither of the two main contributors to the flood were the levels the highest that have occurred in the same period. The Blue Nile was higher in 1908 and the Atbara River was higher in 1916. The high levels at Wady Haifa were due to the fact that the floods from these two rivers coincided in point of time, at their junction, namely, at Atbara. 252. The menace of dangerously high levels in Egypt was met by taking llltaw OT till f MPt. til £11 Q f L i rvi r\-£ i ^ 4-,-. 11 1 _ * ,&lt;1 • .

Masonry will commence and it is hoped to complete this portion of the dam to above low-water level this season. 263. Pile driving is proceeding well in the embankment dam, excavation and concreting between the piling have commenced. 264. Relations between Messrs. Gibson, Pauling and Go’s representatives and the Egyptian Government resident engineer and his staff are most friendly, and the general tone of the contract is exceedingly happy. 265. The gross value of the permanent work executed up to the end of the first season’s working, viz., the 31st July, 1934, was £E. 285,727. 266. The number of Egyptians employed at the present moment is appro ximately as follows :— Masons and stoneworkers Saidis 400 2,200 This represents roughly half the number of workmen, the remainder being Sudanese. The crane, derrick, locomotive and cableway drivers have also been recruited from Egypt. The expert stone-cutters employed at the quarries are Italians, of whom there are approximately 120 at present. 267. Works under survey .—As stated in last year’s report plans were drawn up and accepted for the remodelling of the Assiout barrage and a public adjudi cation was expected to be held in the spring. This did not in fact take place until the autumn, but it was possible to begin work before the end of the year. A number of British firms, including Messrs. Gibson and Pauling (Foreign) (Limited), Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Co. (Limited), Balfour Beatty and Co. (Limited), John Cochrane and Sons (Limited), Edmund Nuttall Sons and Co. and John Mowlem and Co. (Joint) (Limited) (represented in Egypt by Ahmed Abboud Pasha), together with several foreign firms, submitted tenders. The lowest tender was submitted by a French firm, S. A. Hersent, Paris, and there was some anxiety as to whether they would not be awarded the contract over the lowest British tender of Sir Lindsay Parkinson (Limited). On instructions from the Foreign Office the commercial secretary took a suitable opportunity of mentioning the matter to the Minister of Public Works, who assured him that he need have no fear in the matter. The Egyptian Government, he said, were fully conscious of the benefits which Egypt derived from the friendly attitude of Great Britain in commercial and banking matters and would not be unmindful of this when the tenders of the various competing firms came to be examined. The contract was in fact eventually awarded to John Cochrane and Sons (Limited), the fifth lowest tender at £E. 1,077,462. 268. On the 28th June the King of Egypt approved a law passed by Parliament providing for the construction of two new and stronger barrages (to be known as the “Mohammed Ali barrages ) at the head of the Nile Delta. They will be built some 400 or 500 metres downstream from the existing structures, which will be maintained as a bridge for pedestrians and private vehicular traffic and is an “ancient monument ” in view of their being the first bairages on the Nile. The Delta barrages are, of course, of vital importance to Egypt as e irrigation of the whole delta is dependent upon t enl . e „ c ° s 5 ° barrases and of the subsidiary works will be approximately £E 2 500,000 4 He Minister of Public Works expects to be able to advertise the call for tenders in42 Snijof tenders and^theyTiU bfad'udfcUTin g til\falbwf^ work to start before the 1936 flood. 269.

Butcher and Newhouse of the Egyptian Irrigation Department and Mr. Macgregor of the Sudan Irrigation Department. The latter proceeded to New York during the summer for the purpose of discussions in connexion with the drawing up of the final plans which are expected to be presented to the Governments concerned early in 1935. At one stage the Egyptian Government evinced some nervousness lest, by taking part in technical discussions with the White Corporation, they should become committed to the early construction of the Lake Tsana scheme. It was suggested to them by Mr. Macgregor that, when the time came for further discussions with the'White Corporation engineers, the Egyptian Government should safeguard their position by asking for an assurance from the Residency that if they were to finance the project in the first instance they should be at liberty to choose the time for beginning construction. Authority was obtained from the Foreign Office for the grant of such an assurance, subject always, of course, to the fact that permission to carry out the works would be a matter for negotiations with the Ethiopian Government. 271. Egyptian Irrigation Service in the Sudan .—Early in the year, Mr. Butcher, Director-General, Southern Nile, informed the High Commissioner that a serious situation had arisen in regard to the organisation of the Egyptian Irrigation Service in the Sudan. This service is maintained in the Sudan by the Egyptian Government partly to supply the authorities in Cairo with hydrological data and partly to carry out investigations connected with future irrigation works in the Upper Nile basin—Lake Albert Dam, the Sudd channels, &amp;c. The senior officials in the service are British and they are directly under the Director-General, Southern Nile, at the Ministry of Public Works, who is also a British subject. The position in regard to these British officials had been unsatisfactory for some time past as the Egyptian* authorities had consistently declined to replace the existing British staff who had retired or were nearing the age for retirement. The Residency obtained the authority of the Foreign Office to take this matter up with the Egyptian Government, and in October 1933 Mr. Butcher communicated to the Egyptian authorities a memorandum indicating the steps which he considered should be taken to put an end to the existing unsatisfactory position. The most important of Mr. Butcher’s proposals was that the number of British officials employed in the Egyptian Irrigation Service in the Sudan should be increased and their terms of service improved. At the same time steps were taken to impress upon the Minister of Public Works the importance which the Residency attached to a satisfactory solution of the problem, and it was agreed that as a next step Hussein Sirry Bey, the Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Public Works, should produce a scheme of his own for dealing with the situation. The latter completed fns memorandum about the middle of January, and in the meantime and the Minister of Public Works had evinced their .-i r * utcher s proposals and more particularly his suggestion for the'sudan. ' ° f ° fficials in the E^ian Irrigatioffservice in43 272. In his memorandum, Hussein Sirry. Bey adopted the extreme Egyptian point ot view and suggested that the service in the Sudan should be graduallv Egyptiamsed. He assured Mr. Butcher, however, that he had only written his memorandum with his tongue in his cheek, hoping that his Minister would realise the impracticability of Egyptiamsmg the service. He added that he would welcome a clear intimation from the Residency that His Majesty’s Government would insist on the maintenance of the British staff in the Irrigation Service in the Sudan. ^ Having ascertained from the Governor-General of the Sudan that the Sudan Government still attached considerable importance to the maintenance of British officials in the key positions in the Egyptian Irrigation Service in the Sudan, the High Commissioner took the matter up with the Minister of Public Works, who informed him that he had just put forward a modified proposal to the Prime Minister which was acceptable to Mr. Butcher, but in regard to which he was unwilling to commit himself on paper. This proposal, in a slightly modified form, was accepted by the Prime Minister, and after some delay Mr. Butcher was formally instructed to prepare a detailed scheme. This was duly done, but it was not until the High Commissioner had found it necessary to take the matter up with the Prime Minister, some months later, that these proposals were approved by the Cabinet. Early in November Mr. Butcher reported that he had got two new British Assistant Directors of Works accepted, both for service in the Sudan. There is still one appointment to be filled. Public Security. 273. The crime statistics for the judicial year 1934, while far from satisfac tory, show a decrease rather than otherwise as compared with the previous year. The figures are as follows, those for the year 1933 being given in brackets for purpose of comparison: murder 1,546 (1,550); attempted murder 1,121 (1,166); assault resulting in death 372 (349); assault resulting in disability 550 (554); theft with violence 415 (392); attempted theft with violence 96 (118); arson 671 (799); poisoning of cattle 52 (60); damage to crops 116 (127); kidnapping 28 (41); offences regarding currency 77 (49); indecent assault 297 (339); derailing trains 55 (47); other crimes 1,464 (1,380). 274. The main interest in this question of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom is the security of foreigners, which was one of the subjects reserved under the declaration of 1922 by which Egypt was granted her indepen dence. In this respect the past year has been unsatisfactory, although the number of serious crimes against foreigners shows a slight decrease and murders and attempted murders has decreased from twenty-nine to twenty-two as compared with the previous year. The majority of the murdered foreigners were Greek overseers of estates in the provinces, the only British victim being the Rev. J. Carden, a retired military chaplain. One of the accused in this case was sentenced to death and the other to penal servitude for life. 275. Representations were made to the Minister of the Interior in January with the object of securing greater security for foreigners living in the provinces. As a result of careful study the conclusion was reached that the unsatisfactory position regarding murders of foreigners was due to four causes . (&amp;) the check on police activity consequent upon the criticisms of police methods of investigation 1™- iVid r.rmrt of Cassation in the Badari incident (see pararaph 3 of last 276.

Moreover, they were to ask for death sentences m murder cases (c) The Ministry of Justice undertook to reconstitute the Chambers o Assize Courts where murder cases were tried, selecting judges of known character and ability. • (d) Instructions were given for intensive searches for illegal arms ^ cities the Provinces and the Frontier Administration areas to be made, and for a stricter control of armourers with a view to preventing ,1 -11 1 j: 277. The measures taken, particularly by the administrative authorities, have already had some effect, the search for illegal arms, for instance, producing considerable results, and the crime returns showing an immediate if small improvement. Reports received later also showed that some attempt was being made to improve relations between the police and parquet authoiities, but indications that they are still working in watertight compartments is not lacking. 278. All these measures, however, can have no lasting effect, unless and until the courts show increased severity, particularly in connexion with murder cases, but no marked improvement in this direction is to be observed. One of the most remarkable decisions was that by which two men committed for trial on a charge of murder were released on bail of £E. 10 each. It is true that a start has been made by the dismissal from the assize courts of two or three incapable or corrupt judges, but a great deal more will have to be done before good results can be expected. 279. A careful examination was made of all cases of murder of Greeks and other foreigners which were committed in the provinces during the last ten years and tried in provincial assize courts. It was found that, although several death sentences were obtained in the cities, not one was secured in the provinces. There were twenty-six such cases, of which fourteen went to trial and only in six were convictions obtained. In at least two cases it appears to be established that the course of justice was impeded by tampering with witnesses and persuading them to allege police cruelty. 280. As a result of this study several new suggestions have been made by the judicial authorities with a view to safeguarding the course of justice from such intrigues. These suggestions are still under consideration. 281. Three bombs of the usual demonstrational type were discovered during the year, but no attempt had been made to explode them and in the first two cases the police were notified of the whereabouts of the bomb by anonymous letters. 282. On the 22nd January a bomb was placed on the garden fence of Wassif Ghali Pasha’s house, and the anonymous letter explained that the object was to persuade the pasha to declare his attitude towards the Nahassist Wafdists. 283. The second was found on the 9th March on the wall of Prince Mohamed Aly’s garden, and was declared to be a present to “the new King of the Sudan ” a reference to a current rumour that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom proposed to separate Egypt and the Sudan and place the Prince on the throne of the latter country. The third bomb, found in the grounds of the Amencan^Umversity, was an old bomb wrapped in a newspaper dated the 17th Drugs. 284. The Narcotics Bureau has functioned actively during the year and ias made several important seizures of drugs. Statistics are not yet available * ,h ' ti “* »• have been preserving large quantities of drugs to addicts who are no lonffr abk45 to obtain supplies through the normal channels. Several doctors and chemists nas been interrogated but tne enquiry has not reached the stage when iudicial proceedings can be instituted. 6 J 286. The Egyptian Government was represented at the May and November meetings of the League of Nations Anti-Opium Advisory Committee by Lewa Kusseli Easha and Miralai Baker Bey respectively, and general sympathy was shown towaids Egypt s efforts to cope with the particular problems confronting the country. b Civil A viation. 287. During the year 1934 Misr Airwork operated the following air services :— Service. Miles Flown. Passengers Carried. Period of Operation. h: Cairo-Alexandria .. 156,071 5.934 All the year round. Cairo-Lnxor-Assouan 30,030 293 From 1.1.34 to 31.3.34 and from 15.12.34 to 31.12.34. Gairo-Mersa Mutruh 7,172 127 From 9.6.34 to 15.9.34. Cairo-Port Said 16,296 155 From 26.5.34 to 6.12.34.

In spite of economic conditions, substantial progress was achieved particularly in passenger traffic. 292. Royal Dutch Air Lines.—The Royal Dut ^ continued to operate a regular weekly air service between Holland and Batavia. 293 The Egyptian Government has authorised the company to operate this air service twice weekly with effect from the 1st September, 1935. 294. Dalian A ir Tines.—During the course of negotiations which took place in Rome providing for certain modifications m the Anglo-Italian con^entio resSng P a?r transport services of the 16th May, 1931, His Majesty’s Government agreed informally to use their good offices with the Egyptian Government m order to obtain acceptance of the Italian Governments request for facilities for the operation of Italian air services between Italy and her Mediterranean possessions on the one hand, and her colonies on the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean on the other on the understanding that reciprocal facilities would be given to Egyptian air services. The Italian Government reserved the right to ratify the convention only after full acceptance by the Egyptian Government of the above desiderata. According to reports from His Majesty’s Ambassador, the Egyptian Government were reluctant to agree to anything more than a temporary arrangement. I hey eventually agreed, however, to an arrangement for the extension of the Italian air lines as far as Alexandria only, for a period of six months, subject to renewal, and the Anglo-Italian convention was duly signed in Rpme on the 11th December. The Egyptian Government are now engaged in considering a draft Egyptian- Italian convention with a view to a permanent extension of Italian air lines through to Eritrea. 295. Halfa-Luxor Air Line. —A proposal was made in 1933 for the inaugu ration of an air line between Luxor and Wadi Haifa by the Egyptian State Railways using Misr Airwork’s planes. The proposal was agreed to in principle by the Sudan Government and it had been hoped to start the service in November 1934, but owing to certain difficulties having arisen over a change in the timings of the Sudan train connexions at Wadi Haifa, it has not yet been found practi cable to start operating. 296. There is reason to believe, however, that the Egyptian State Railways authorities were somewhat premature in their plans, an adequate reserve of machines, &amp;c. not being available for the proper maintenance of the service. 297. It is hoped that the necessary adjustment of time-tables between the two systems will be made in due course and the service started with an adequate organisation. 298. The Aero Club of Egypt. —The National Aero Club of Egypt is the only authority in this country responsible for the issue of customs “ Carnets de passage en douane ’ which enables the holders to travel without having to make payment for customs dues on aircraft when arriving in a foreign country. During 1934 the National Aero Club of Egypt issued sixteen customs “ Carnets.” Only one club is at present affiliated to the National Aero Club of Eewnt viz • “ The Alexandria Flying Club.” &amp; n &gt; ^ a ^ n / a l A ero Club of Egypt, as the sole recognised representative o± the I ederation Aeronautique Internationale in Egypt, was represented at the Congress held by that body at Washington, the 8th-12th October, 1934. 300. Gliding. The National Aero Club of Egypt has formed a gliding club. The question of granting the club a subsidy to enable it to providl the initial equipment, the purchase of gliders and means for catapulting and launching is at present under consideration. r g u mumnniig is Pri ™te Foreign Flights.—In view of the fact that Egypt is not a contracting party to the International Convention of 1919 which regulates air navigation it was necessary for every foreign aircraft desiring to fly ofer or land a Egyptian territory to obtain beforehand an authorisation to that effect&gt; 47 ^ i 3 ? 2 ^^w 61106 ! ^ as shown that this method caused inconvenience and flying ^ the Pll ° tS and hampered the devel opment of aerial tourism and private ^ ^ lth the object of amplifying the procedure for obtaining permits for tne flight of foreign aircraft, the Egyptian Government, early in 1934, elaborated a scheme by which Egyptian consular representatives abroad could be entrusted with the issue of these permits. The scheme was adopted throughout the year 1934 with apparently admirable results. 304. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have agreed to His Majesty’s consular officers who are empowered to deal with Egyptian passports and visas also undertaking the issue of these permits within their consular districts and instructions to consular officers on the subject are in course of preparation. 305. The following foreign aircraft were authorised to fly over Egyptian territory during the year under review Nationality— No. No. British 109 Roumanian ... 11 American ... 3 Czechoslovakian 2 German 2 Dutch 1 French 29 Italian 20 Portuguese ... 4 This statement does not include aircraft operating regular air services by Imperial Airways and Royal Dutch Air Lines (K.L.M.). 306. Flying Licences .—During 1934 the following flying licences were issued, renewed or validated :— Egyptian licences Class &lt;£ A” issued ,, „ „ „ renewed Foreign licences Class “A” validated for flying Egyptian registered aircraft ... Egyptian licences Class &lt;£ B” issued ,, „ „ „ renewed Foreign licences Class ££ B” validated for flying Egyptian registered aircraft ... 22 16 10 2 1 14 307. Private Aircraft .—At the end of 1934 the number of private aircraft registered in Egypt was as follows :— Number. Type of Aircraft. Engine. Nationality. 2 De Havilland Moth.. Gipsy I .. British 1 Gipsy II.. ,, * • i Gipsy III n • • 2 Klemm Salmson.. German 1 Monocoupe Lambert R A merican 1 Waco Jacob 308. Ground Organisation. —During the year 1934 the following hangars were constructed at State aerodromes : One large span hangar, 52-5m. x 50m. x 12m., at Almaza Airport. One hangar span, 30m. x 25m. x5 - 25m., at Dekheila Airport. One hangar span, 30m. x 25m. x 5-25m., at Mersa Matruh. 309. A suitable site was selected for the establishment of a State airport at El Arish The necessary preliminary works were completed. A hangar 30m. x25m. x5-25m. will be constructed during the year 1934-35. 310. Owing to the recent developments and the considerably increased &gt;erations of Messrs. Imperial Airwavs (Limited) from Dekheila a large span mgar capable of housing land aeroplanes and flying boats will be constructed in 1935-36.Sll The further provision of municipal aerodromes m Egypt has been under consideration. Several sites were inspected. Son ties have been established at Assiout, Mima and Port Said. The British authorities nave kindly “ted to the use of the Royal Air Force aerodrome at Suez for civil flying. 1 „ J 'Ll- . I In 1 o -iTTill Kp SlTTlllflT’lv equipped by the end of April 1935. 313. Wireless Services.—The Almaza wireless station commerced operation early in 1934. During the year under review a wireless station was constructed at Mersa Matruh. gjq The construction of direction-finding stations at Dekheila, Mersa Matruh and El Arish is in hand. 315. The arrangement under which the Egyptian Government had agreed to issue under certain specified conditions permits to enter and leave Egypt in their private aircraft to officers of the Royal Air Force serving in the Middle East Command was extended to cover officers of the British army serving in Egypt, the Sudan and Palestine or British officers serving in the Sudan Defence Force,’the Transjordan Frontier Force or the Arab Legion in Transjordan. 316. Some difficulty was experienced owing to the failure of Italian civilian aircraft to comply with the regulations governing flights over and landings on Egyptian territory. In one case a civilian Italian seaplane although warned that the Suez Canal Zone was a prohibited area deliberately flew over the Canal and even went so far as to give its position by wireless to the Royal Air Force wireless telegraph station at Ismailia. The Egyptian Government made a protest to the Italian Government on the subject and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome was also instructed to draw the attention of the Italian Government to the fact that the Suez Canal Zone was a prohibited area and to express the hope that similar incidents should not recur. On the 13th November the Ministry for Foreign Affairs addressed a circular note to the Residency and foreign missions in Cairo drawing attention to the fact that certain foreign aviators had failed to obtain the necessary permits for landing in Egypt and requested that the matter should be brought to the notice of the authorities concerned. In acknowledging the receipt of this note the Residency said that the matter would be brought to the attention of the authorities concerned for such action as might be possible in regard to civilian aircraft. 317. Foreign Military Landings .—^Towards the end of 1933 the late Prime Minister was informed by the High Commissioner of the procedure which His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom expected to be carried out in regard to the landing of foreign military aircraft in Egypt, viz., that the authority of the Residency, as well as that of the Egyptian Government, was necessary for a foreign military aircraft to land in Egypt. The Prime Minister recognised the reasonableness of His Majesty’s Government’s attitude and undertook to try to find a satisfactory formula. No formula was actually devised, but in practice progress was made during the year in establishing the procedure desired by His Majesty s Government. I he Residency were in fact consulted by the foreign Legations concerned in regard to all military flights through Egypt and the concurrence of the Air Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, Middle East, was obtained m each case. Moreover, as all the flights in question also included the budan the Residency were m each case notified of the flight by the Egyptian authorities either officially or unofficially. In the former case the Ministry for foreign Affairs said that the matter had been referred to the Sudan Agent'. In pnm eir a wn L ei i ^ e P lles the Residency were careful to state that the air officer able“o sa 1 v n t § | ll t a rt b Tf “r ted and h t d . r ^ 1 sed no option and they were also able to say that the Sudan Government had likewise been consulted and had eiven AffakrTU In CaSe ’, at end of the y ear - the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated spontaneous^ that the air officer commanding had bren consulted in the matter. This information had presumably been furnished by Sir Q. Brand. Director of Aviation. Although, therefore the general nosftion m regard to procedure has not been formally regularised there anoears to he no matter' bein^toregard^ WiSheS ° f ^ Ma ^ st y’ s Government in regard to this49 Egyptian Air Law.

The question was largely academic, but the Egyptian Government wished to lay down the thesis that there were no Capitulations in the air. It was at first thought that the only way out of the difficulty was to omit the offending article altogether, which would, however, probably have given rise to considerable criticism in Parliament! Eventually a solution was proposed by Bedawi Pasha which was accepted by Judge Vaux whereby a short law would be passed through Parliament consisting of two articles only, one containing a declaration of full sovereignty in the terms of article 1 of the previous draft and the second giving the Government power to legislate by decree for air navigation. A decree reciting the second article only of the new law would then be promulgated and would contain the remaining articles of the existing draft which had already been approved by the Court of Appeal. Although it was felt that there were objections to circumventing the expressed intention of the Court of Appeal, the Residency felt that if Judge Vaux agreed to this proposal there was no reason to object and that in any case it would also be possible to give the Egyptian Government His Majesty’s Government’s interpretation of the declaration. In the circumstances His Majesty’s Govern ment agreed to the proposal, but no action was taken by the Egyptian Government with a view to bringing the draft law before the Comite consultatif before the end of the year. Religious Freedom. 319. Interest in missionary activities in Egypt, which had never completely died down since the excitements of June and July 1933, was kept alive during the spring and summer by various incidents for which hostile vigilance secured publicity in press or Parliament. A member of the Egyptian General Mission, who distributed tracts among pilgrims awaiting embarkation at Suez in March, was roughly handled. Two native women teachers in the American Mission Bible School at Tantah, engaged in house-to-house visitation in June, were held by the public and handed over to the police. In reply to a parliamentary question arising out of this incident, the Minister of the Interior declared that the Govern ment was determined to prevent a recurrence of similar proselytising activities, “to preserve order and to ensure the freedom of religion safeguarded by the Constitution”; a somewhat paradoxical invocation of a constitutional guarantee that has never been properly implemented. The murder of a convert at Bahaleel (Girga); constant friction between the Swedish “Salarn School in Port Said and two self-appointed censors, and the discovery that a sister superior in Cairo had defrauded the Customs by importing free of duty, for third parties, a barrel of wine later found to conceal heroin, helped to keep the smouldering nre alight. A highly indiscreet incursion into local politics by Bishop Gwynne at a Diocesan Association meeting in London on the 18th June fanned it to a flame. 320. On the 28th July the rector of A1 Azhar, the Grand Mufti and the President of the Supreme Mohametan Law Court formally represented to the Minister of the Interior that the missionary menace must be checked. Eeissy Pasha promised definite action in the shape of a law and produced an offensive and entirely inacceptable Bill for the regulation of missionary activities which he proposed to submit to Parliament during the winter session. He was informed by the High Commissioner on the 17th August that no legislation would b [11244] E• J 4 • f rrr^nh Hid not 'ive effect to the constitutional guarantee of liberty considered just which die , f,- b :i it j es un der which converts from Islam at of conscience by Christianity cannot obtain registration present labour. k , lose t p e i r rights of inheritance.

Instructions were received by the Acting High Commissioner at the end of September to discuss the religious question frankly with the Pn e Minister and if necessary and possible, with King Fuad, and to make it clear His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were under no illusion where the blame lay for any revival of anti-missionary agitation In four separate phases of the religious problem~(the provision of re igious teaching for Coptic pupils in elementary schools; the reform of non-Moslem personal status iurisdiction; the religious freedom of converts from Islam and the proposed legislation for the control of missionary activities)—the attitude of the Egyptian Government was condemned as highly unsatisfactory and as justifying every hesitation on the part of the Powers to remove such safeguards against oppression as the Capitulations and the Mixed Courts. The Acting High Commissioner was instructed to press the Egyptian Government in their own interest to adopt a policy more in accordance with the trend of modern belief and practice in civilised countries and, in particular, to urge that Nazla Ghoneim, the Moslem woman convert referred to in paragraph 288 of the annual report for 1933, should be authorised to return to Egypt from Palestine, whither she had been sent for refuge from a barbarous Sharia Court decree. 322. Political developments prevented early action upon these instructions, for there was felt to be grave danger in giving to a regime which had unsuccess fully attempted to unite public opinion on the independence issue a chance of repeating the attempt on the religious issue. With the fall of Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha’s Government vanished a regime particularly prone to manifestations of Islamic zeal, and the attitude of the new Prime Minister, when the general and particular issues were raised with him in the course of his first interview with the Acting High Commissioner, was forthcoming and friendly. Tewfik Nessim Pasha undertook forthwith to facilitate the return to Egypt of Nazla Ghoneim and her husband, and arrangements were made for quashing the Sharia Court judgment against her, should her return provoke attention and renewed hostility. The couple returned to Egypt on the 24th December. 323. While the ill-advised activities of free-lance missionaries are responsible for most of the anti-missionary agitation, it must not be thought that there is no provocation on the Moslem side. Dr. Mohammed Soliman and Mohammed-el-Shirdy in Port Said have busily fomented fanaticism during the year. Complaints are also frequent that Coptic officials in the railways and other administrations suffer for their faith; and a Sharia Court claim to remove from their parents’ care the minor children of a Copt who, for domestic rather than doctrinal reasons, embraced Islam for six months (thus making his children Moslems) and then returned to his wife and his Church, was only defeated by pressure on the Minister of Justice. 324. Much, no doubt, of the trouble is due, in Upper Egypt at least, to the attitude of the Copts themselves. Before the British occupation, Upper Egypt was in fact, though not in form, ruled by the Copts. The Turkish Governors were usually ignorant and uneducated and could do nothing without their Christian clerks, who had the whole administration in their hands. Later, when the education of Moslems began, they rapidly usurped the place of the Christians, and to-day they have entirely the upper hand. The Christians now constantly look for political protection, and while some place their hope in the Wafd, others look for protection from the missionaries and seek thereby to resume their former arrogance.-j-,' i, 1 ^h th© disappearance of a regime which sought, by pandering to mg uad s notorious Islamic ambitions, to achieve in the field of fanaticism a popu arity otherwise impossible, there is ground for hope that the religious problem, m all its phases, will be more realistically and more reasonably handled. Non-Moslem Personal Status Jurisdiction. , r ^^ le P r0 P°sed reform of non-Moslem personal status jurisdiction (see paragraphs 341-34/ of the annual report for 1932), which had lain dormant for some eighteen months, was discussed by the Comite consultatif de Legislation during August and September. The trend of discussion was towards the estab- lishment of the general principle that questions of personal status for non- Moslems who are Egyptian subjects shall normally be decided by the native courts, while preserving what may be comprehensively described as the existing Patriarchal Courts as exceptional tribunals for the decision of such personal status questions as are considered to be of religious nature wherever the parties concerned are all of the same religious confession. It was proposed that the native courts should apply a new code, the preparation of which was entrusted to Maitre L'Abbate of the State Legal Department. This draft has now been completed. 327. The attitude of the Minister of Justice, Ahmed Aly Pasha, was less helpful than that of his predecessor, who had recognised the necessity of obtaining, by consultation, some measure of concurrence in the new pro jet from the important minority communities concerned. Ahmed Aly Pasha proposed a system of ‘ authorised leakages” only, and refused to communicate the text of his draft legislation officially to the communities; though he expressed his willingness to consider any observations they might wish to make upon it. He was informed that the Residency was unable to consider “authorised leakages” as adequate and was reminded of the responsibilities of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in the matter of the protection of minorities. 328. The draft legislation was still under discussion by the Comite consultatif when the Abdel Fattah Yehia Ministry resigned, and no further developments occurred before the end of the year. Greek Orthodox Community. 329. The long-drawn-out controversy between the Patriarchate and the Greek Orthodox lay community of Alexandria was settled in June by the Synod’s acceptance of the laity’s amendments to the proposals for patriarchal elections, sanctioning lay participation in these elections. The regulations drawn up in reflection of this agreement remained under consideration by the Egyptian Government until the end of the year. These regulations are not acceptable to the Syrian elements, who claim wider representation than the regulations grant them, and efforts to reconcile the conflicting points of view have so far been fruitless. Pilgrimage. 330. An improvement in economic conditions was reflected in the increase of Egyptians performing the pilgrimage from 1,732 in 1933 to 4,167 in 1934. The Transport of Egyptian pilgrims was effected by the “ Societe Misr pour le Trans port et la Navigation ” in virtue of a twenty years concession granted by decision of the Council of Ministers in July 1932. The state of health of the pilgrims was excellent. His Majesty's Courts in Egyft. 331. Two proposals regarding the organisation of His Majesty’s^ Supreme Court in Egypt have been under consideration during the year. The first, regarding which agreement has been reached in principle, relates to the appoint ment of His Majesty’s Crown Prosecutor to perform in relation to the Supreme Court the functions which the King’s Proctor performs in matrimonial causes before the High Court in England, with the limitation that he shall only act m cases where facts are brought to his notice. The second is a suggestion that a registrar of the Supreme Court should be appointed, one of whose functions would be the taxation of costs.

T. Maclean having been appointed to replace Air Vice-Marshal C. L. N. Newall. 3*13 Although, in general, the conduct of the Bi itish forces is extiemely good there have during the past year been a number of cases in which individual soldiers and airmen have been accused of offences against the civilian population. Disciplinary measures were promptly taken and the agitation in the Arabic press, which was aroused by these occurrences, died down quickly when, shortly after wards, it was reported that soldiers of the Egyptian army were accused of some- writ n a 1 W1 1 1 O T* ntt All PAG Wireless. 334. By law No. 4 of 1906 wireless telegraphy was declared to be a monopoly of the State/ In due course Egypt adhered to the Convention of St. Petersburg of the 5th July, 1912, and that of Paris of the 29th October, 1925, and promulgated a decree of the 10th May, 1926, to give effect in Egypt to their provisions. 335. On the 1st April, 1926, Lord Lloyd decided that wireless communica tion must be held to be covered by the reservation in the declaration of the 28th February, 1922, concerning the security of communications “of the British Empire in Egypt,” and immediately on the promulgation of the decree on the 10th May, 1926, he addressed to the Egyptian Government a formal notification, thereafter known as the “ Wireless Caveat,” requiring his assent to be obtained prior to the grant under the decree of any licences for wireless emission or reception of any kind. The Egyptian Government refused to accept the political implications of the caveat and suspended the operation of the decree until the caveat should be withdrawn. To avoid delay, however, the concession was granted to the Marconi Company of Egypt under a special decision of the Council of Ministers on the 23rd May, 1926. A period of chaos ensued, unlicensed receiving sets multiplied in the hands of private persons, a number of small local broadcast ing stations sprang up and in due time the columns of the press, native, English and foreign, were filled with news intercepted without licence either by themselves or the Havas News Agency and frequently stolen from mid-air and published without regard for the inoperative wireless decree or the laws of copyright. 336. On the 16th and 21st July, 1932, agreements were signed with the Egyptian Government and between the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Marconi Company of Egypt, whereby the latter was authorised to control and work the cable circuits of the former as a combined undertaking, with its own wireless sei vices. At the same time the concession was granted by the Egyptian Govei nment to the Marconi Company in London to operate State broadcasting as agents foi the Government. On the 13th February, 1933, the Egyptian Govern ment authorised the Marconi Company to intercept news telegrams for Reuter’s Agency, subject to the payment of royalties. . . • 2 r ly afterwards the Wireless Caveat was withdrawn, on an under- e j g&gt;ptian Government that the wireless law would be enforced th.t n en 7ln r the Same time ’ let the com P eten t Egyptian authorities kno^ be re^rld h A' Government .Ration for any but purely internal purposes woulc gai ded by them as inconsistent with the arrangements made in 1932. annourcin^Hn^cf^T^f 1 ^’ Egyptian Government issued a Royal decree Madrid oi/the 9 th Tele-Communications Convention, signed al the 11th Januarv 1994 ^ aiK ^ Egyptian Government or the 11th January, 1934, was to come into force as from the 1st January, 1934.

This enables an European programme to be given on the ihefoth F ° n ^ 16 a ^ erna ^^ ve ’ s i' a i'i° n when the Arabic programme is in progress on 340. Mi. Furness had already been appointed Director of Programmes and k 03,1 ’^’ consisting of the following, had been set up last year : Dr. Ali ibrahim Pasha, as chairman; Bedawi Khalifa, to represent public security; Knaied Hassanem, as educational representative; Mr. Furness and Mr. Delany. 341. Fiiction developed in April, before broadcasting had even begun, over the appointment of Lufty Bey as director of Arabic programmes. The Minister or Communications, Ibrahim I ahmy Pasha, expressed his surprise to Mr Furness and Mr. Delany that the first three names proposed for appointments in connexion with broadcasting had been those of persons known to be hostile to the Govern ment, namely, Dr. 4 aha Hussein, Sheikh Aly Abdul Razzik, both of whom the programme board had rejected; and Lufty Bey, whom it had accepted. It subsequently became clear that his action was taken at the instigation of the Palace. 342. Mr. Furness and Mr. Delany were not prepared to admit that, under article 1 of the contract of the 21st July, 1932, by which the Marconi Company operated broadcasting in Egypt as agents of the Egyptian Government, the latter had any right to interfere over appointments or personnel. The judicial adviser was doubtful on the point, but the Foreign Office legal advisers were inclined to agree with Mr. Besly that the contract agreement did not give the Egyptian Government any power to direct the company as to what persons they should or should not employ, on the ground that the principal’s power to direct the agent does not ordinarily extend to the personnel to be employed by the agent. A compromise was finally reached by changing the name of Lufty Bey’s post to director of the Arabic section, but relations with Ibrahim Fahmy remained most unsatisfactory. 343. The opening of the Government broadcast service and the closing of the private stations was followed by widespread criticism, chiefly that programme hours were too restricted. Simultaneous Arabic and European programmes were required, and that the Arabic programme was too heavy and not entertaining enough. The opening of the second stations in Cairo and Alexandria met the first two points, but dissatisfaction with the programme has continued. 344. At the end of June Mr. White, managing director of Marconi’s of London, visited Egypt, and on return expressed profound dissatisfaction with the results of the broadcasting concession to date. Subsequently, Mr. Furness was offered, and accepted, the post of Director of the Press Bureau in Palestine and Mr. R. Ferguson was sent out in September to replace him. 345. In September rumours reached the ears of Marconi (London) that one of the grievances against the company was the use of the title “ Egyptian State Broadcasting Service,” which caused suppliers to think that they were dealing with the Egyptian Government, although the sub-title “ Agents Marconi Wireless Telegraphy Company, London,” seemed to make the position clear enough. The Residency, however, saw no objection to the continued use of the title and the matter was not pursued. 346. Wireless and News Messages. —Early in 1934 the question of the unauthorised reception and publication of wireless news broadcasts in Egypt became acute. Takla Bey, one of the most influential newspaper proprietors, had at last been persuaded to subscribe to Reuter’s Service as picked up by the Marconi Company of Egypt, and he felt very bitterly the injustice of the failure of the Government to enforce the law against other newspapers who pirated the news from unauthorised receivers. The Marconi Company and Reuter’s felt even more strongly about it and received support from Cables and Wireless (Limited) and from the Imperial Communications Committee. 347. Early in May a notice was issued by the general manager, Egyptian State Railways, Telegraphs and Telephones, calling the attention of the public to the provisions of the Royal decree of the 10th May, 1926, and the Ministerial “ Arretes ” No. 11 of 1926 and No. 39 of 1932, concerning radio-electric com- [11244] E 3munic&amp;tion in Egypt. Possessors of radio-electric apparatus were specially warned that they must comply before the 1st June, 1934, with the above-mentioned decree and “ arretes ” and must cease any irregular use of radio apparatus. 348 The fees laid down for wireless receiving sets by Ministerial ‘ ‘ Arrete,” up to a maximum of £E. 4 annually, are payable by foreigners by virtue of article 7 of the decree of the 10th May, 1926, approved by the General Assembly of the Mixed Court of Appeal sitting in accordance with the decree of the 31st January, 1889. 349. Apart from the collection of fees, no real effort was made to enforce the law, and the unauthorised reception and publication of news messages continued. In consequence Marconi and Reuters and their supporters returned to the charge and set to work in a practical way to gather evidence against both the receivers and the publishers. 350. Meanwhile, the question of the attitude to be adopted towards official messages broadcast by foreign Governments arose. The Director-General, European Department, considered it desirable, in order to protect Egypt from foreign propaganda, to forbid the publication of these C.Q. messages in Egypt, even if that ban also involved the British official wireless messages. On balance I agreed with Mr. Keown-Boyd’s view. I did not feel that the extent to which the British official wireless might be used in Egypt would justify the risk of having Egypt flooded out with other foreign Government propaganda, much of which was anti-British in character and therefore popular with the native press Moreover, if, as the result of being deprived of gratis official wireless news, many lesser organs of the native press were to disappear, nothing would be lost. I therefore referred the matter to the Foreign Office and asked for instructions. 35E Foreign Office telegram No. 9, Saving, of the 1st May, pointed out that under the proposals submitted while the British Official Wireless C.Q. service being a &lt;£ news message broadcast for general reception ” would come under the ban, German and other foreign services would escape it by being “ addressed to one or more particular addressees.” Finally, after the exchange of further correspondence, the Secretary of State in his despatch No. 587 of the 8th August suggested that the following formula should give the Egyptian Government all the power necessary to exclude undesirable political messages from publication. ^ r \ u 1 T lvmuai or nrm 111 ^gypt, except Messrs. Marconi, is licensed o undertake the direct reception for publication in that country of any broad cast messages sent by wiieless telegraphy or telephony from a foreign station. 1 he reception of such messages is undertaken by Messrs. Marconi in virtue of authorisation issued by the Egyptian Government in favour of approved persons or news agencies who desire-to publish the messages in Egypt. Such authorisa tions will contain a provision excluding political propaganda and will be wduf 5 6 Kif C L° f thlS ° r any - ( ? ther condltion of the authorisation. A fee will be payable to Messrs.

British Officials. . Tll 1 ere has been no amelioration of the unsatisfactory conditions on which British officials are serving in the Egyptian Civil Service, to which attention was called in paragraphs 217—219 of last year’s report. . Excluding assistant masters in the secondary schools, twenty-five British officials, graded Class V and upwards, have left the Government service during the year. Of these fourteen have been replaced by other British officials; the appointment of British officials to six other posts is under consideration. Egyptians have been appointed to the remaining five vacancies. In no case has a British official been succeeded by other than an Egyptian. Egyptian University. 358. News was brought to the Residency in November that it was proposed to reinstate Dr, daha Hussein as Dean of the Eaculty of Arts, a post from which he had been dismissed by the Sidky Government in 1932. 359. Taha Hussein, after his dismissal, had joined the editorial staff of the Wafdist Jehad and Wadi, and in the course of a long journalistic campaign against the Governments of Sidky and Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha, indulged in violent anti-British attacks. : -.W \ . 360. In view of the above Mr. Peterson thought fit to speak to the Prime Minister on the subject. 361. Mr. Peterson was informed by the Prime Minister that Dr. Taha Hussein was to be appointed as Professor of Arabic, and that he had no intention of allowing him to become dean again. 362. Tewfik Nessim Pasha was informed in reply that Mr. Peterson had no objection to his being appointed Arabic Professor provided that he refrained from attacking foreigners. 363. The question of the reinstatement of Lutfi-el-Sayed Bey as rector of the university was under consideration at the end of the year. It was held up owing to the opposition of King Fuad. Secondary Education. 364. British Teachers .—The attention of the Residency had long been occupied by the unsatisfactory position of British teachers serving under the Ministry of Education. The disabilities under which they worked are fully set out in the 1933 report and need not be recapitulated. It had already been decided by my predecessor that the first step towards remedying these grievances would be to appoint a senior Englishman in the Ministry of Education who would be recognised by the Government as the chief and sponsor of the English staff, and who would control the relations between the Ministry and the whole of its British and foreign staff. Mr. Simpson, the Controller of Physical Training, was thought to be a fit man for the post. 365. In May, permission was obtained from the Foreign Office to endeavour to move the Egyptian Government to agree to the creation of a special post for Mr. Simpson in which he would exercise the functions described above. Accord ingly an aide-memoire was submitted to the Minister of Education on the26th May suggesting his appointment and describing what it was considered his principal functions should be. These were : (1) That all questions affecting the status and treatment of European officials of the Ministry, including transfers within the service, should be referred to him before any decision was made. (2) That no European official should be dismissed without reference to him. (3) That no disciplinary measures should be taken against European officials without consulting him. (4) That any proposed termination of contract should be referred to him before a decision was made. (5) That all European officials should have access to him. (6) That he should have direct access to the Minister to discuss all questions that might arise. It was also requested that Mr. Simpson should continue to exercise his duties as Controller of Physical Training, receiving an extra £E. 300 per annum for his new post. 366. The Minister of Education, Hilmi Issa Pasha, did not receive these proposals with the best of grace. Indeed he made it clear in a conversation which he had with the Oriental Secretary that he considered that these proposals impinged on his honour and independence as a Minister. The only satisfaction that the Minister of Education was prepared to offer was the suggestion that he should fill the vacant post of Inspector-in-chief of the Ministry of Education, whose functions in no way resemble those sought for Mr. Simpson. 367. Intervention by the Prime Minister stiffened Egyptian resistance, and an unfortunate leakage to the press resulted in a campaign by the Nationalist organs exploiting freely the bogey of a return of Advisers to the Ministries and a Cromerian regime. His Majesty himself was adamant against accepting our demands. It was thus obvious that the original demands in the Residency aide-memoire could not possibly be satisfied without recourse to very strong methods. In fact the Egyptian Government refused to admit that under the contract terms British teachers had any real grievance. 368. After delicate and protracted negotiations and submission of the whole matter to the Foreign Office, it was therefore decided to be content with a compromise and to accept conditions which the Prime Minister submitted in a note dated the 23rd July. This aide-memoire stated that as Mr. Trench, the Controller of European Administration, was fully occupied with his present functions, the Prime Minister, in agreement with his colleague in the Ministry o Education, had decided to appoint another high British functionary to examine all questions concerning the treatment and discipline of British teachers in the secondary schools, both male and female, including their transfer and the non- uaffild h f th T 9 ontra ^ ts - lhls rather unsatisfactory reply was, however, accom- nnwdf by i cert ^ 1I \ verbal assurances from the Prime Minister which he was unwilling to include m his note. These were :— Education; ^ uiiiuicii stuecteu (2) That Mr. Simpson’s contract as Controller of Physical Training would , Q , be renewed for a period of three years; S 1 t “ * “ 1 -*-* (4) ^ 369.

T 7 P 37 p 2 ‘ T .n eS TT Pr f P °| als were not received with good grace by the Ministry of Education, the Under-Secretary arguing that accommodation in the schools^for Christian religious education could not be provided without increasing the cost of the construction of each school by £E. 100. He was, moreover, opposed to the introduction of the Effendi type of teacher into the elementary schools. On the other hand the Coptic Meglis Midi objected to any suggestion that religious education should be given m church by priests owing to the notorious ignorance ot the latter. They held, moreover, that the estimated cost of the construction 0± accoaim . odatlon . was pl g p ly exaggerated and that facilities should be provided for the instruction of Coptic children on the elementary school premises at a cost far inferior to that suggested. They also considered that a minimum of twenty students per school was much too high. 373. The Coptic Patriarch finally made seven proposals to the Minister of Education. These were :— (1) That religious education should be obligatory for the Copts as for Moslem pupils. (2) That it should be given within the schools. (3) That it should be given by Orthodox Coptic schoolmasters holding a secondary teacher’s diploma or an equivalent certificate. (4) That the eight hours weekly prescribed by the law for religious instruc tion for each school year was appropriate for Christian religious instruction. (5) That the Coptic schoolmasters should be appointed to every school having ten or more Coptic pupils to teach religious and other subjects. (6) That a circuit schoolmaster should be appointed to teach Christian religion but not profane subjects in every school having less than ten Coptic pupils. (7) That arrangements should be made for the adequate supervision and inspection of Christian religious instruction in elementary schools. 374. These proposals remained under consideration by the Egyptian Government at the end of the year. 375. Mr. Peterson raised the matter in conversation with Tewfik Nessim Pasha on the 17th November and found him on the whole sympathetic and disposed to treat the Coptic question with consideration. Alexandria Municipality. 376. The Committee of Enquiry appointed in November 1933 to report on the allegations made against certain municipal officers and the late Minister of the Interior in connexion with the construction of the Corniche Road completed its investigations and submitted its report to Keissy Pasha, the new Minister of the Interior, in April last. 377. This report recommended the dissolution of the Municipal Commis sion, and passed severe strictures on the Director-General, the Secretary-General, the Chief Municipal Engineer, Mr. Armstrong, and two other engineers, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Serrao. The main part of the report was couched m an unpleasing form, which all the efforts of the English member could not rectify, and it was more similar to the speech of a prosecuting counsel than to tkat of an objective enquiry commission. The statement of responsibilities (p. 239) and the conclusions (p. 271) were more objective in tone, and the whole made up for the less satisfactory tone of the preceding part. 378. On the technical side, it left no reasonable ground of doubt that the work done by the contractors was deficient both in quantity and quality to such i degree as to amount to a serious fraud. In addition, a very strong case was shown for regarding the supplementary prices, which applied to about two-thirds n va l U e of the total bill of approximately half a million pounds, as seriouslyexaggerated and their acceptance as reflecting a complaisance on the part of the reSmsMe municipal officials which is hard to account for, except on the hypothesis of a desire either to please or to prolix. 379. On the administrative side, the report was naturally more contro versial based as it had to be on the evidence of witnesses instead of on soundings and chemical analyses. The evidence of over 100 witnesses was summarise and conclusions drawn as far as possible from such of it as was not regarded as unreliable. Even so, many doubts remain which could only have been cleared up by a judicial hearing, which would have enabled and, in some cases, obliged the persons whose actions were the subject of adverse criticism to speak in their own defence and be submitted to cross-examination. As for bidky Pasha, the report considered that he had given his ministerial approval to the allocation of the contract in a hasty and irregular manner, but that it was impossible to decide on the evidence, and without hearing him, whether the suggestions of improper motives so widely made by witnesses were well founded or not. As for Ahmed Seddik Bey, the report blamed him as Director-General for irregu larities, either committed or acquiesced in, which had enabled the contract to be given to the contractors, Messrs. Dentamaro and Cartareggia, in an improper manner and carried out by them in the way indicated above. At the same time, the report insisted that in his case no reliable evidence pointed to dishonesty on his part or any conduct affecting his honour. As for Ibrahim Bey Fouad Sid Ahmed, the Secretary-General, the report found that he had acted in a manner which had facilitated both the irregular grant of the contract and also the insertion in it of special, favourable terms to the prejudice of the municipality, and the members of the Commission of Enquiry expressed themselves as not entirely satisfied that he had not received certain financial advantages himself from the contractors. 380. As the result of this report, the Director-General, the Secretary- General, the Chief Engineer, Mr. Armstrong, the Supervising Engineer, Mr. Wilson, and the engineer in charge of the works, Mr. Serrao, were brought before Councils of Discipline. For all except the Director-General, the Council of Discipline was purely municipal, and composed of the Governor, Hussein Sabri Pasha, as president, Mr. H. 0. Holmes, the vice-president of the Municipal Commission, and Mr. Mills, Abdel Razak Abul Kheir Bey and Abdel Latif Ghorbal Bey, municipal councillors, as members. The Director-General was by law only amenable to the High Court of Discipline, presided over by Sadek Yunes Pasha, the Under-Secretary of State to the Ministry of the Interior. In all these cases charges were formulated based on the findings of the Commission of Enquiry. The Diiector-General was found guilty of negligence and various irregularities in his administration, but was acquitted of any suo-gestion of dishonesty. In consequence, he was sentenced to the penalty of cc mise a la retraite ’’ with retention of full pension rights. The cases before the Municipal Council of Discipline resulted m Mr. Serrao being dismissed with loss of one- quarter of his pension rights, Mr. Wilson being reprimanded, Mr. Armstrong M Sm rn dWlth the rete ? tl0I T°f ful1 pension rights, and Ibrahim Bey Fouad Sid Ahmed being acquitted. With regard to Mr. Armstrong, it must be remarked that it was not within the power of the Municipal Council of WU to P aWard , the r? al C of “ mise a la retraite .” which was awarded to he Director-General, and that dismissal (“ revocation ”) with full pension rights g««S; i£irs;“S‘ y A sS sssfifflftsasr aaftEfftr* *** whs s cannot but raise doubts whether the dismissedCffieCT 011 ° f evlden ce these doubts are not iLIened bv the nrTf V ffim f U 5 recelv e d fair play, and consisted of the Under-Secretarv of State feUi?'-! 0 ! ^ a PP eal tribunal, which at least in theory, partially resnonsib e for Ufr’ Wh ° had hirasel f been, officials who could not be expected to have much influenTC ht decision.Ml 59 Council oMJisciDlIne^TVr!' 8 Xrrn f leaK \ a § a *j St t ^ e decisions of the Municipal was le-allv imnossihle ° dg j d an a PP eal - but on findin g th at it Ha withdrew It P6nalty reduCed fr0m “ r6vocation ” t0 “ 383.

One of the firs actions of the Administrative Committee was to refuse to pay to the contractors the sum of over £E. 100,000 claimed by them as the instalment due under the contract on the 1st May. As a result, the contractors instituted proceedings in the Mixed Courts against the municipality and the Government foi the balance due under the contract, and added a claim for damages for libel m respect of the report which had been published in two Arabic newspapers. publication ^ P endm S- The Government denies having authorised the r i a P ^satisfactory state of affairs in Alexandria was brought to hght by the Corniche report that the Government decided to appoint a second Commission of Enquiry to report on the whole working of the municipal machine and to make recommendations for its reform. This commission was presided over by Ncguib Bey El Hilali, who has since become Minister of Education in iewhk Easha Nessim s Cabinet, and included among its members Mr. Brookfield, th® Assistant Legal Secretary to the Judicial Adviser, Roche Bey, of the Ministry of the Interior, and Mr. Atkinson, of the Ministry of Public Works, who had been the chief technical member of the Corniche Commission. At the end of July the first part of the report of this second commission was submitted to the Government. It dealt with the administration and the system of election to the commission, making recommendations for reforms in both these fields. These recommendations were based on a thorough and unbiassed review of the working of the existing machinery and were accepted by the Government. As a result, a law and two c ‘ arretes ” were drafted by the Ministry of the Interior making certain modifications to the decree of 1890. 385. As the full texts of these drafts have been forwarded to the Foreign Office, it will suffice to recall that they involve the abolition of the delegation and of the office of Secretary-General, the assimilation of the office of Chief of the Sanitary Service and Chief Engineer to those of Director-General and Assistant Director-General, which are already filled by Government nomination, and the creation of a new office of Financial Controller to be filled in the same manner. At the same time, the old system of election to the fourteen elective seats on the commission by colleges is abolished in favour of a general electoral panel. The size of the commission remains the same at twenty-eight members, of which six are ex officio members, eight are nominated by the Government and fourteen are elected. The franchise is extended to £E. 24 householders under the £ £ limited vote ’ ’ system, and each elector has the right to record eight votes. None of these innovations appear to be objectionable in themselves, but in two respects it was found desirable to modify the proposed legislation to guard against possible dangers. (m) 386. First, the original text left it open for the Egyptian Government, without modifying the law, to add to the number of municipal offices made subject to its nomination, and so to whittle away the powers of the commission. Changes were made in bringing into relief the intention of the legislator that only the offices above referred to should be so filled. 387. Secondly, the old proviso that of the elected members only three could be of the same nationality which had ensured the election of eleven non-Egyptians, was replaced by a new rule that only two of the same nationality other than Egyptian could be elected. This obviously gave no assurance of a minimum of foreign elected members. Strong pressure resulted in the insertion in the draft law of a proviso that there must be aminimum of eleven foreign members out ofm * the twenty-two nominated and elected. With the two ex officio members, the procureur general of the Maxed Courts and the chan man of the Quarantine Board, this ensures a foreign representation of thirteen, or one short of 50 per cent. It is proposed to insist on the Egyptian Government nominating an addi tional foreign member in order to secure the balance. 388. The law so amended was promulgated on the 1st January, 1935, under article 41 of the Constitution of 1930, and was followed immediately by the publication of the two complementary “ arretes.” No reference was made to the Powers because the financial clauses of the decree of 1890, to which alone their assent was then invited, and given, were not modified by the new law. The new law was badly received by the British and other foreign communities in Alexandria, it being freely prophesied, amongst other things, that under the new electoral arrangements it will be almost impossible to induce suitable candidates to stand for election, and that the Wafd will be able at will to swamp the elections. These fears are considered, however, to be exaggerated. 389. Meanwhile, the second Commission of Enquiry continued its investi gations into the working of each municipal department in great detail. No further report, however, has yet been presented. 390. The year ended on a tragic note owing to the sudden death on the 26th December of the Acting Director-General, Mr. Coatesworth, after forty years’ unbroken service in the municipality. Pending the appointment of a new Director-General, Sadek Yunes Pasha has been delegated to act in that capacity. Meanwhile, steps had already been taken to prepare the way for the appointment of Mr. R. Davies, Director of the Department of Economics and Trade in the Sudan, as sub-Director-General in place of Mr. Coatesworth, who, anyway, was proposing to retire. The Egyptian Army. 391. General.— recent change of Ministry has apparently had little e ect on the army. The late Minister of War, Salib Bey Sami, was exceptionallv helpful and sympathetic during his term of office. The present Minister, El Lewk Mohammed lewfik Abdulla Pasha, appointed on the 15th November, was formerly m he army, but held the post of Director of Prisons for many years. He appears of the^rmy t0 C0 '° perate with the In spector-General and the Headquarters Staff ^ w 392 - R ere haS been a marked tendency on the part both of the late Minister of Wai and his successor to press for increases in the strength and armaments of forces g whi c a h hasTnovitaW* 1 - 115 f ° r ‘i e) and t - he Frontier s Administration torces, winch has inevitably involved the wider question of the policy to be a (Ionted KsS&amp;enei’aTFrT t0WardS W 1 - army. A^mendatZ bj the Inspector-General, Egyptian army, for the purchase of a further flie-ht of ten aircraft armed with machine guns was referred to the Foreign Office foApproval after acceptance by the late General Officer Commanding Britfsh YZTfn Egypt, and the late Air Officer Commandina' Middle Fast Isfi lroo Ps m however subject in the case of the foSjo th CbL vatZ thaZifsTmT; proposals for increased armament for the Egyptian armv and f ComZd 111 futar V tlme WOuld w ZnChe GWaPofficer MiaiiT— trttaXTf 1 “ l l, ”&gt; «P *’ the ^',1^ as his predecessor and stated that a c Z , nam &amp; toop the same view expansion unless and untif there was soZ ° Pp0s . ed to an y ^Omr relations, when the whole question of His Ma'lestes' 3 Cover , m y, l d r l 0 -Egyptiim regard to the Egyptian armed forces would have tZe eonsfdered * P Cy With61 393. Shu^tly afterwards, the Minister for War put forward a proposal to the Inspector-General, Egyptian army, for increases in the Egyptian army and the supply of a few small tanks. General Spinks was able to persuade the Minister that the purpose of the Egyptian Government would be better served by the provision of two or three additional light car patrol sections, each armed with two Vickers guns, for service under the Frontiers Administration. The General Officer Commanding, to whom this proposal was then referred, replied that before giving a considered reply, he would like to be informed of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the whole question of such demands for the increase of the Egyptian army and air force. The Residency were later informed that the Egyptian Government proposed to increase the strength of the Frontiers Administration by five light car patrols and two camel corps sections. 394. The above proposals were referred to the Foreign Office, but while they were still under consideration, it transpired that they had come up at a meeting of the Egyptian Army Council, at which the Inspector-General was present, had been approved and submitted to the King and would be included in a special credit to be submitted to Parliament shortly afterwards when the army budget came up for discussion. In order, therefore, to avoid the disagreeable necessity of having to veto proposals already adopted by Parliament, it was necessary to obtain an urgent decision from the Foreign Office. After further consultation with the General Officer Commanding, approval was eventually given for the additional flight of aeroplanes and for an increase in the Frontiers Administration forces of two sections of camel corps and five light car patrol sections, with the proviso, however, that the latter should not be equipped with machine guns. The Minister for War was able to secure the acceptance of these proposals by Parliament without undue difficulty, and he was subsequently reminded by the Inspector- General, at the request of the High Commissioner, of the fact that no increase in men or armaments of the Egyptian army or air force was in any circumstances to be made without the express approval of His Majesty’s Government, At the same time, the Inspector-General’s attention was drawn to the partial failure of proper co-operation with the Residency, which had made it possible for proposals of this sort to go so far without the full knowledge and sanction of His Majesty’s Government. Steps were also taken to ensure more satisfactory co-operation between the Residency, the Inspector-General, Egyptian army, and the Air Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, Middle East. 395. The question of the policy to be adopted towards the development of the Egyptian army is understood to be still under discussion between the Foreign Office and the Departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned. In the meantime, however, the late Prime Minister on the 15th August spontaneously raised with the High Commissioner the question of the future of the Egyptian army. He said that he felt that the army as at present organised (i.e., without tanks, machine guns and other up-to-date weapons) was as good as useless, and asked’ whether it would not be sounder policy to have a more effective Egyptian army to help Great Britain in the event of trouble. In reply to a personal enquiry from the High Commissioner as to whether an increase of British control over the Egyptian army might not be accepted as a counterpart to increased efficiency and effectiveness, the Prime Minister reacted not unfavourably and asked what were the technical and other requirements of His Majesty s Government The High Commissioner undertook to look into the matter while he was m London on leave. 396. The additional flight of aeroplanes arrived safely in due course, but up to the end of the year no action had been taken for financial reasons in regard to the provision of the proposed additional camel corps sections and light cai patiol sections. 397. Towards the end of the year the new Minister for War informed the Inspector-General, Egyptian army, that he proposed to include in the Lido 3b estimates a provision for an increase of one cavalry squadron and one batta on of infantry Ghe General Officer Commanding, on being consulted took the li addition of a squadron of cavalry. From ^tfe British force’s hi Egyp , he62 situation had changed. The matter was accordingly referred to the foreign Office with a suggestion, that the Minister for War should be asked to hold the proposal up for the time being. 398. Promotion of Officers.—The regulations regarding the promotion of officers promulgated on the 24th duly, 1932, and ameliorated on the l-^th danuary, 1933, have been further relaxed by the decision of the Council of Ministers that all local ranks shall become substantive after one year from the date of promotion to such local rank. 399. The draft of the new Recruiting Law regarding a reduction of conscripted service from five to three years is again being considered by the Army Council. Air Force. 400. The strength of the Egyptian Army Air Force was increased during the year by the addition of a flight of ten modern general purpose aeroplanes. 401. The replacement of five obsolescent £ ‘ Moth ” aircraft by a more up-to- date type is also being considered in connexion with the 1935-36 budget. 402. Approximately 3,800 hours’ flying was carried out in service training, co-operation with Frontiers Administration and completing several photographic surveys for other Government Departments. 403. The Egyptian flying officers have improved in flying skill with increased practice, but the criticisms of their professional proficiency quoted in paragraph 407 of last year’s report are still applicable. 404. One fatal aeroplane accident occurred during the year, resulting in the death of the pilot and slight injuries to the officer passenger. 405. Fight front- and eight back-seat aircraft machine guns have been received during 1934 and taken into use for training. Preliminary air and ground training has been completed, but no air firing exercises have been carried out. 406. No training or exercises in bomb aiming has been undertaken. 407. Arrangements were made during the year for three Egyptian officers to be attached for a year to British infantry regiments serving in the United Kingdom, and the M ar Office also agreed that an artillery officer should attend a young officers’ course at the School of Artillery, Larkhill, in 1935. r . - I-M iwo ^gyP^ 11 medical officers are also to attend at the Central Medica 1 Establishment to observe the methods adopted in the medical examination anc assessment of medical fitness for the Royal Air Force r romiers a amimstration. tj ffL Pj Q ' ll S ■' eai ' a ri L ° major happenings fall to be recorded in (1: fral?on trat *T^ * The was one of Political calm, and adminb tration has been permitted to proceed without interference In addition to tl maintenance of control over the wide areas administered by h s Departmen progress has therefore been made in various directions. nieparrmen • Ui- Notably is this so in the case of agriculture. It is well known that i ancient times somewhere about the beginning of the Christian era the Wester Desert was intensively cultivated, and it is now fairly generally accepted that tl water for this cultivation was obtained from rock cisterns. Some thousands c these are known to exist, but all have silted up with sand owing to long disus steady S e nfa S li are Tb ed Wlth gr( f U P as the resillt of a few hour' w falL are now being cleared as fast as money can be nrovide for the purpose, and the water they retain is being' used for thl PcfoKiioU + e olive gardens. Olives need very little water. normal rainfall is sufficient for their needs, so that the scheme holds out almoiboundless possibilities, and the day may not be far distant when Egypt will cease to be under the necessity of importing olive oil. The Governor has conducted a powerful propaganda in order to popularise the project with the Arabs, and excellent results have been achieved. A similar scheme is being proceeded with in Sinai in the neighbourhood of El Arish. This is limited in extent by the fact that cisterns do not exist in Sinai, and water can be found only by developing existing resources or digging new wells in promising localities. 411. Another development is the establishment of further schools in all the provinces. For some time past elementary schools have existed in sufficient numbers, but there is now a strong inclination to add to these primary schools where education can be continued. These have been started privately in several places, and it is hoped that next year they will be sanctioned and taken over by the Ministry of Education. Unfortunately industrial schools in which the pupils could learn some craft appear to have no appeal to the people. 412. During the course of the year there was grave danger of serious inundations being caused by the exceptionally high Nile. A call was made on the Administration to provide as many cars and camel corps men as possible to patrol the banks. Twenty-eight cars and 160 men were made available and worked on this duty for four weeks. They had, of course, to be withdrawn from their normal anti-contraband work, and there is evidence that the smugglers got to know of this and some runs took place, one of which the weakened patrols were so fortunate as to intercept. 413. In the course of one routine anti-contraband patrol an encounter battle took place with the very distinguished smuggler Abd-el-Salaam Kidr. One of the car patrol men was killed by rifle fire and Abd-el-Salaam Kidr was wounded, but made his escape. In spite of the most strenuous efforts to effect his arrest, he is unfortunately still at large. 414. In May sanction was received for an increase of five light car sections and two camel corps sections for the Frontiers Administration. Financial provision for this is included in the budget proposals for 1935-36 now under consideration. The Administration has been pressing for an increase of one or two sections for years, and even if the large increase now proposed is finally sanctioned, it would not be too much for the proper performance of the tasks requiring to be done. 415 One of the most difficult problems confronting the Administration is the recruitment of suitable staff for the executive posts. The system which circumstances have forced on the Department in recent years, under which junioi executive staff is found by selection from among the clerical staff, has not proved an unqualified success, and certain of these officials have had to be returned to the clerical establishment. No solution is at the moment apparent of this nroblem which arises from the fact that it is very difficult to get the central authorities to take a serious and intelligent interest m the ^on ^v Sami “forms tion. To this general statement, the late Minister of War, Salib Bey Sami, forms an honourable exception. 2&amp; Tl ? 6 In a note sent by the International Labour Organisation to the Labour e desire of the Un ted States frove, t0 be n0 longer any ^ =dSL» rf E.,p. into U» International L.ho.r 0, B .n..a.,». 417. The year was characten^d by an^tnCTetwe.m .labour^unwwt. ^Thrs 3'' SSWOW szssrzssvtt-* - ™ x “ ,oi ' b “64 Federation of Syndicates and to leave their own trade unions. Abbas Halim’s house in Cairo*had in the past always been a meeting-place for disgiuntied workmen, and, by reason of his increased activities, the numbers visiting tne house daily became so large as to constitute a danger to public security. I he authorities therefore came to the conclusion that these continual meetings were a contravention of the Law of Public Meetings. Acting on information that a meeting was to be held on the 21st June, the police surrounded Abbas Halim s house. Large bodies of workmen appeared and finally rushed the police cordon. The police were forced to open fire, and there were casualties on both sides, one workman subsequently dying of gunshot wounds. A week after this incident Abbas Halim was arrested, and a charge formulated against him of instigating workmen to form illegal gatherings. There was a certain amount of sympathetic reaction by labour elements, and strikes occurred amongst taxi drivers and in a sugar factory. After a period of provisional detention lasting one month, Abbas Halim was released on the 24th July, and the case against him temporarily filed for lack of evidence. Seventy-seven workmen participating in the demonstration at Abbas Halim’s house received sentences varying from six to two months’ imprisonment. Abbas Halim’s imprisonment appears to have had somewhat of a salutary effect on him, particularly as he ascribes his release entirely to British intervention. He is as active as ever in his endeavours to create his Federation of Syndicates, but is showing more of an inclination to co-operate with the Labour Office. It is noteworthy also that the trade unions are now more inclined to enrol themselves under his banner. Communism. 418. The year was noteworthy for another attempt by the Communist International to establish their influence in Egypt by direct action. Towards the end of 1933 a workman in the arsenal workshops in Cairo confided to the authorities his anxiety at having fallen into the hands of Communist agents. The workman subsequently indicated a certain Selim Youssef and another named Hussein Kharrat as being primarily concerned in these Communist activities. Selim Youssef disappeared from Cairo before the end of 1933, but he was after wards definitely identified as Wahib-el-Malek, a notorious Syrian Communist, who had been a graduate of the Oriental College for Propaganda in Moscow. Before his disappearance Selim Youssef had installed as his assistant Hussein Kharrat, who in his turn was subsequently identified as Ali Hussein Hassanein, an ex-Egyptian, who had also been to the Moscow College, and had been on that account deprived of his Egyptian nationality. Touch with the gang was lost after Selim Youssef’s disappearance until certain suspicious correspondence arriving from Brussels put the authorities once more on the track. This correspondence was addressed to various cover addresses, and contained various instructions in regard to the despatch of fresh Egyptians to the Moscow College and the methods of directing the Communist movement in Egypt. In some cases the letters also contained money in the form of 1,000-fr. bank-notes. In the meantime, Hussein Kharrat had begun to organise the movement. He confined his attention almost exclusively to workers and dismissed workers of the arsenal and the State Railway workshops of Cairo. Having got hold of a nucleus of disaffected persons, he tried to induce them each to form a ct cell ” consisting of one chosen workman and two others. Hussein Kharrat also had a room where he used to lecture the workmen in the approved style of Moscow. Hussein Kharrat was also making arrangements, as called upon to do by the letters, to send two more Egyptians to Moscow. They did not however, start as the gang was rounded up by the authorities prior to the conclusion of the arrangements. This took place in June, and the moment for striking was influenced by the fact that the correspondence pointed to the probable receipt by Hussein Kharrat of more money. Actually, a letter containing two Ml ktri ?hp ef L a n^ e f P™ mis ® of 6 ’0° 0 fr - more on receipt of acknowledgement tell into the hands of the police who were making the arrests. Twenty-two arrests were made and important documents discovered. Of those arrested it could be said that six were active and dangerous. The remainder were in most cases ignorant individuals, who had been attracted both by gifts of money and also by the specious and glib arguments of the Moscow propagandist. ^ m65 Shipping. J^QVVtian Ports Traffic .—The movement of shipping at Egyptian i r e nine months ended the 30th September, 1934, was as follows :— Number of vessels Net registered tons Cargo— Egypt-. Transit Passengers— Egypt... Transit Arrivals. Departures. 6,674 6,658 23,950,000 23,940,000 Tons. Tons. 2,811,000 1,887,000 1,148,000 263,000 51,000 71,000 6,500 860 The apparent exodus of some 20,000 persons from Egypt is accounted for by the tact that these figures show the efflux of winter tourists during the earlier part oi the year and the exodus of local residents during the Egyptian summer, the majority of whom return after the end of September. 420. Alexandria Harbour Rates .—British and foreign shipping companies have for some time past been complaining of the high harbour rates charged at the port of Alexandria. The Residency interested itself in the matter, pointing out that a reduction of the harbour dues would probably lead to an increased tonnage using the port. A committee has been appointed to go into the matter, but there seems little likelihood of any substantial reduction in the dues in the near future. 421. Sudan Cattle Boats .—The Residency also endeavoured to obtain a reduction of harbour dues on ships transporting Sudan cattle from Port Sudan to Alexandria for the Egyptian market. This request was at first refused, but it has been put forward again. 422. Suez Canal Traffic .—The Suez Canal traffic is still increasing and with a total tonnage of 20,903,000 for the first nine months of 1934 was 1,264,000 tons or 6-4 per cent, greater than in the corresponding period of 1933. 423. Compared, however, with the first nine months of the record year 1929, the traffic till the 30th September of this year is 19 per cent, lower than that of the corresponding period of 1929. The most significant fact in this deficit is that the north-south traffic, i.e., from Europe to the East, has fallen off by 41 per cent., whilst the south-north traffic, i.e., from the East to Europe, by only 6 per cent. The significance of these figures is augmented by the fact that Japan’s trade for the first time in history is greater from the south to the north than in the inverse direction, which would appear to show that Japanese purchases of Western manufactures and raw materials are being surpassed by her increasing exports to Europe, and those Asiatic countries accessible from the Mediterranean. 424. Another point of interest in the Suez Canal Company’s returns was the increase of Russian north-south cargoes. For the whole of 1933 this trade amounted to 1,074,000 tons, which was approximately double that of 1932, and for the first nine months of this year the total was already greater than the whole of 1933, amounting to 1,101,000 tons. The principal items concerned in this movement were petrol, grain, railway material, cement and salt. 425. Canal Dues .—On the 1st April the Canal Company reduced their dues by 25 centimes gold per ton on loaded ships, and by 12^ centimes gold on ships in ballast. The Canal dues are now, therefore, 5-75 centimes gold per ton, and half this sum on loaded ships and ships in ballast respectively. It was hoped that a further reduction of a like amount would be introduced before the end of the year, but so far no announcement to this effect has been made. 426. Misr Shipping Company .—This company now possesses five ships, and during the summer months ran a fortnightly passenger and mail service to Marseilles via Genoa with their vessel the steamship El Nil, which was fairly well patronised. It is authoritatively stated, nevertheless, that the company lost a considerable amount of money in this venture. [11244] F66 427. The fifth vessel, bought in Italy, is intended to supplement the Marseilles service, whilst of the remaining three, two are primarily intended for the pilgrim traffic and the third as a cargo boat. The pilgrim ships are also used as cargo boats in the pilgrim off-season. 428. So far the Misr Shipping Company has done little to justify its existence. The ships, with the exception of the El Nil and the more recent purchase, have laid unoperated in Alexandria harbour, and opinion is unanimous that the company, an off-shoot of the Banque Misr, has lost a considerable sum of money in their operations, and there appears to be no prospects of recoupment in the future. 429. The question therefore arises how long the Banque Misr will be prepared to support this white elephant concern, and when and how the banque will eventually cut its losses. Meanwhile, Talaat Harb Pasha’s passion for creating Egyptian industries is coming in for considerable criticism. Quarantine Board. t 430. Major Gilmour, as president of the Quarantine Board, has so difficult a team to drive, and does it with such success, that it is satisfactory to record that he has at last been readmitted to the cadre of the Egyptian Civil Service. Major Gilmour retired from the service in 1923 after twelve years’ service, and received compensation under Law 28 of that year. The financial adjustments necessary to his reinstatement have been settled. 431. The board’s statement of accounts for the year 1933-34 published in July, showed that receipts totalled £E. 112,773, or £E. 11,120 above the estimate while expenditure amounted to £E. 104,420 as compared with the estimated figure of £E. 115,200. £E. 8,350 was added to the reserve, brinoinu the fund ud to £E. 75,078. 8 8 F 432 ‘ t i le current year the receipts are estimated at £E. 107,900 (an increase of £E. 7,000) On the expenditure side £E. 4,800 has been allocated to improvements m installations as compared with £E. 2,250 in the previous year, u be , t lv a r ken f ™ m the reserve fund for the improvement of the lazarets at the Wells of Moses, Suez. Egyptian State Railways. 433. General.—-Shaker Bey has continued to iustify his annointment as general manager of the Egyptian State Railways.

This work should provide useful orders for the United Kingdom in due course. ° a ^ Purchases. Owing to keen continental competition, the Railways . imnustratmn purchases approximately 50 per cent, of its supplies (other than tt - a L 1( U- G ) ^ rom cont i nen tal sources, the remaining 50 per cent, going to the United Kingdom. The commercial secretariat has endeavoured to bring about an increase of the British participation, but in face of lower prices for suitable matenals it has been difficult to make effective headway. The special position in Egypt of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom makes Residency intervention m such matters a somewhat delicate business. Mhanwhile, foreign missions aie not so handicapped, and, having little political work, devote them- sel\es to obtaining orders for the goods of their countries. A hint was, however, conveyed towards the end of the year to the deputy general manager that Great Britain could not afford to concentrate only on large orders if the small ones were the grains of sand which made the shore. 440. Where coal purchases are concerned, however, the Egyptian State Railways, except for a small trial shipment of continental coal, have invariably bought United Kingdom coal, even when at a higher figure than that offered by continental suppliers. 441. The general position is that all coal requirements and 50 per cent, of other supplies are taken by the Egyptian State Railways from Great Britain. 442. Personnel .—During the year the post of chief mechanical engineer became vacant through the resignation of Mr. W. D. Knight. After a considerable interval, a successor has been found in a Mr. C. E. Spurgeon, lately of the North- Western Railway of India, who is expected to take up his duties shortly. The short-term contract of the British director of the road passenger and 'freight services expired during the year and was not renewed. An Egyptian has been appointed to the post. Inland Water Transport. 443. The temporary agreement arrived at in September 1933 between the Egyptian State Railways and the inland water transport companies nearly came to grief during November last. It appears that the general manager of the rail ways became perturbed at the serious falling off in railway goods receipts for the transport of cotton from Upper Egypt. Owing to the number of contracts of exclusivity concluded by the Egyptian State Railways with various concerns in Upper Egypt the water transport companies were deprived of certain articles of freight, including coal, sugar, &amp;c. They were, however, free to carry cotton, to the detriment of the Egyptian State Railways. Shaker Bey, therefore, informed the companies that he would have to impose a cotton quota upon them, 25 per cent, of the takings on all cotton carried by them in excess of that quota having to be paid to the Egyptian State Railways as compensation. Under the threat of a 30 per cent, reduction in rail freight rates for cotton from Upper Egypt, the companies agreed to this arrangement as a temporary measure. [11244] f 2Port of A lexandria. 444. The campaign (attributed to Palace influence) for the extension of Alexandria harbour at a cost of some £E. 3^ million, to be spread over a period of twelve years, received some impetus from the building and development of the harbour at Haifa, and the improvements to the harbours of Beirut and Alexandretta. Fears expressed that the development of these harbours would seriously affect the amount of shipping using the port of Alexandria have, how ever, not so far been justified by actual experience. The proposal is unanimously condemned by the oil companies (including Shell) who, under the existing plan, would be required to remove to another site to make room for a new coaling harbour; by the Chilean nitrate interests, which are also affected, and by the Director-General of the Ports and Lights Administration. On the other hand, shipping interests are apathetic, except as regards improvements, such as modernisation of quay equipment and an extension or recasting of the dispositions for handling coal. The Pi •ess. 445. Viewed as a whole, the Egyptian press during the first ten months of 1934 presented the same somewhat unedifying spectacle as during the earlier years of the 1930 regime. Venality was the rule rather than the exception, and Government pressure was freely exercised, through the allocation of judicial and other official notices or through more direct subventions. The scandal of judicial notices came to a head in the late summer, when seventy-nine newspapers and periodicals ceased publication on withdrawal of the official advertisements which alone had enabled them to exist. Cases of local provincial rags printing and selling only thirty copies a week, and yet, thanks to a generous distribution of Government publicity, making £E. 100 profit a month, were not uncommon. me Government s natural supporters, the Shaabist and Ittehadist newspapers, shared richly in Government bounty, but failed to attract a public. iNeither the Shaab nor the Ittehad, which between them represented the vernacular party press ol the Government coalition, could be bought on the streets or other wise ban by subscription, and their united daily sales were probably below 1 000 f^iT r £T eig , hty at least the benevolent neutrality-of the Ahram and me Balagh cost the Government a heavy monthly subsidy. tinsnnfli The (Liberal) was reported in October to be passing through a up^n 1933 1S ’ aVmg exhaUSted the loan with which Banque Misr bolstered it soberly in if ^ ^ Walk was increasc^rffirfnt 1 ^^! 8 ^ the firew ? rks - T beir journalistic strength Azmy Bey who ioined tl^Vff r° 7 L § ypt 111 the s P rin g of Mahmoud assumption Tn Mav nf in st ^ and b y Ahmed Mah er Bey’s Dr Taha Hussein was dail 6 P ° bt - Ckle / editor °b tbe Kawkab-esh-Sharq. and GeomesXmanf 7 Ven r° US f ^ Wadi; and Achm e Sekaly (piano) (daily) R%orml ^ tfSTooZ Tvf ° f t Wafd ? st °PP°sition in the (daily) Patrie (suppressed bv Sidkv in loom resusc ^ atlon . m November of the development of his peculiar polmie talent. ° ’ SaV6 Duraam added SC0 P e for the trouble durfngthe yearfand'in Julv^ we ekly, was in and out of Effendi, the local 7ohn Citizen with Id edltor M akm g the cartoonist and Egypt Wafdist weekly called Akhir Sn’n aUacb ^ d a . riva l 5 but equally orthodox irresponsible political coffee shoo a ^ h f Se ma &amp; az i n es thrive on humorous style and some occasionallv brdlG f nd scanda1 ’ assiste d by a novel pretentious weekly magazine was rfnm 1 lant &lt; r artooa ?- T he Musawwar, a more trenchant attacks^ Eh impeS^ ^ ° f AbaZa Bey ’ S between suppressions has a small but - dbe ^arkha m the brief intervals is, nas a small but enthusiastic xenophobe public.

The cause celebre of the year was that brought against the Ria^rr m t reSP p e r ° f a series ^ f articles, published in February under the title The Integrity of Government, which were held to be libellous of the Ministers of Communications, Agriculture and Public Works, and of Ahmed Abboud Pasha the contractor.

After a‘series of postpone- ments m June, July and November, the hearing was still in progress at the end or tne year. ° 4 53 With the accession of Tewfik Nessim Pasha to office in November all press-subsidies from secret funds instantly ceased. A period of some confusion ensued, and the Dfilugh, A hratn and other newspapers sought fresh loyalties or the occasion to advertise, by hostile attitudes, the value of their goodwill. A feeling of relief was instantly apparent at the passing of a regime responsible for so many restrictive measures of press legislation. The Minister of the Interior and the State Legal Department had been discussing, during August and September, means to tighten up Government control of the press, with a view, inter alia, to prohibiting criticism of “ any former ruler of Egypt.” Their proposals had been clamorously resented by journalists. With Keissy Pasha’s departure, conversations of a very different nature were initiated; and the Under secretary of State for the Interior, Director-General, Public Security, and Director of the Press Bureau (Mohammed Tawhid Selehdar Bey, appointed in August), held a number of meetings with representative journalists during November and December to discuss the abolition of Sidky Pasha’s unpopular and unpractical Press Law of 1931, and the substitution of an agreed measure, acceptable alike to the profession and the Government. 454. The eclipse of the once famous Kashkoul in April merits record. Within recent years this paper had sadly degenerated, changing its allegiance as monetary considerations dictated. Its moral and material bankruptcy followed a successful lawsuit brought against the paper by Juan Sint^s, its brilliant cartoonist, for breach of contract. Another Kashkoul now appears as a daily independent paper of no interest. 455. The brief excursion into journalism of t£ Emir ” Habib Lotfallah may also be noted. He bought the Journal du Caire when Enkiri got into financial difficulties in April and ran it on lunatic lines for seven months, with the local Daily Herald correspondent as his editor. In December he sold it to the Marcovitch group, who have put it temporarily to sleep. Enkiri, meanwhile, launched the Courrier d'Kgyyte, which lasted no time, and the Echo d'Orient, which also has no great promise of life. 456. The following table, showing the estimated circulation of the principal newspapers at the end of 1934, is given with reserve; entirely reliable estimates are impossible to obtain. It represents a collation of information supplied by the Press Bureau, by sales organisations and by various experienced local journalists. The figures, if not authoritative, are probably relatively correct:—Arabic Daily Papers.

Foreign companies enjoying some concession or monopoly have had to face considerable hostility on the part of both the public and the Government unng e }ear.

A diaft law had already been prepared but it is hanging fire because certain C y ltl f 1SinS i n- prmcip 6 have been d i recte d against it, particularly with regard to the desirability of Egypt’s accepting the full provisions of the Berne Convention relating to translations. The attention of the competent department was again drawn to the matter when the new Government assumed charge. Obituary. 463.
