January 1919. CONFIDENTIAL. P.-85. M Ec THE FUTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE. Memorandum by Lord Curzon. THE Eastern Committee having discussed at some length the future of Constantinople, Mr. Balfour asked me to place on record the arguments that had been used for or against the various solutions. Upon one point all were agreed, viz., that the Straits should be internationalised, that there should be a free passage for all merchant ships and men-of-war through the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora, and the Bosphorus ; that the forts which command all or any of these waters should be either dismantled or razed to the ground, and that under whatever control Constantinople were left or placed, guarantees should be provided that the above conditions were not either evaded or infringed. Similar strategic considerations would probably demand the prohibition either of a tunnel beneath or of bridges over the Straits. The following larger questions then emerged:— (I.) Whether the Turk should or should not be allowed to remain as a governing Power in Europe. (11.) Whether, in the event of his being expelled, any, and if so what, Power should be invited to take his place; or (III.) Whether an international body, or Commission, should be set up at Constantinople to supervise the execution of the suggested conditions, and if so, whether this would be compatible with the retention in any form of the Turk, or whether it would necessitate his expulsion. I. It was pointed out that the expulsion of the Turk from Constantinople was one of the avowed objects of the war. Great Britain and France agreed in 1915 to hand it over—together with the Straits and a considerable strip of land on both the European and Asiatic shores—to Bussia, as the prize ot victory in the conflict. At a later date, in the Statement of the War Aims of the Allies, promulgated in reply to President Wilson in January 1917, the ejection of the Turk from Europe was explicitly included. . The language of President Wilson pointed to a similar conclusion. Neither the Turk nor anyone else could therefore have any ground for surprise if the threat were now earned out. It has been made known both to him and to the entire Eastern world. . The arguments that were used in favour of its fulfilment were the following. For nearly five centuries the presence of the Turk in Europe has been a souiceof distraction, intrigue, and corruption in European politics, of oppression, and misrule to the subject nationalities, and an incentive to undue and overweening ambitions in the Moslem world. It has encouraged the Turk to regard himself as a Great I ower, and has enabled him to impose upon others the same illusion. It has placed him in a position to play off one Power against another, and in their jealousies and his own machinations to find pretexts for his continued immunity. It has been an inexpugnable barrier to the solution of the Balkan problem or the full emancipation of the Balkan peoples. It has been an equal obstacle to the proper or good government of his own people, whose resources have been squandered in the polluted coulisses of C onstantmople, or in the expenditure required for the upkeep of military and naval forces dispropoi tionate to the real strength or requirements of the Turkish nation. ^ An opportunity of cutting out and getting rid for ever o: this plague spot, such as has not arisen for centuries, has now presented itself. It may not recur for generations. The world is looking for great solutions. Let not this occasion it was argued, be missed of purging the earth of one of its most pestilent roots ot evi .On the other hand it was urged that the disappearance of tne lurk wnne removing an admitted ill, will introduce a number of new and unforeseen complications in its place ; that if his claws be clipped, and all power of offence taken away he will become an innocuous if not a positive respectable creature, that, once ’ his friendly relations with ourselves are resumed, he may even provide a benevolent buffer between the ambitions of Europe and our own Eastern possessions ; that his expulsion would be a grave outrage to Mohammedan sentiment throughout the world, and more particularly in India, where the successive blows under which the Sultan and his dominions have reeled in recent years are said to have created an unfavourable impression, and where this final sentence would be regarded as a crue affront to Islam, prepared or connived in by Great Britain, the second greatest Mohammedan power in the world. # In reply, however, to these forebodings, it was pointed out by many who have direct knowledge of India that the Indian Mohammedans have never attached any particular sanctity or reverence to Constantinople : that they have grown accustomed to the gradual diminution of the Ottoman power in Europe and Africa ; that they have borne without excitement his expulsion from the Holy Places in the present war, that they have even fought against the Turkish armies in more than one campaign; and that they evinced neither astonishment nor regret when the intentions of the Allies with regard to Constantinople were announced to the world. So far indeed from being surprised by their fulfilment, they would be more likeiy to regard it as a mar k of Allied weakness or of the Sultan s diplomatic triumph if they were now abandoned. In this contest it was remarked that the present attitude of the 1 nrk at Constantinople, and his evasions and pretexts in respect of carrying out the armistice, are an eloquent confirmation of the position which he may be expected to assume should his adversaries be so weak or so foolish as to spare him. The question of the removal of the Turk was to some affected by considerations of the identity of his successor ; inasmuch as some, who were in favour of expulsion on the merits, were disposed to qualify their views, unless satisfied as to the substitute b\ whom he would be replaced. II. This brings me to the second question—viz., whether, in the event of the disappear ance of the Turk, any foreign Power could profitably or safely be put in his place. President Wilson is believed to favour the selection of some neutral State. I here is no such State possessing either the prestige, the influence, or the resources that would justify it for the task ; and the placing of Constantinople in the hands of a weak Power ^ would be not an avoidance but an encouragement of future trouble. Moreover, the selection of any such State w r ould result in the embittered jealoysy of those minor Powers who have for long aspired to the inheritance. Of these, Bulgaria was thought at one time, in the early stages of the first Balkan war, to have a good chance, but she forfeited it by her errors in the second Balkan campaign, and by her conduct in the recent war. Her selection would now be impossible, and would arouse the undying animosity ofRoumania and Greece. The latter Power could only be chosen at the cost of similar heart burnings. She has no claim for so immense an increase of authority, which her slender military and naval resources would render her powerless to maintain, and the smaller but still considerable extension of territory wdiich she is likely to receive as the result of the war should more than satisfy both her ambitions and her deserts. Of the Great Powers France is already, as reported in the daily telegrams, endeavouring by every manner of means to establish a position of predominance in Constantinople, and, in the imperialistic spirit by which she appears to be animated, would doubtless clutch at a prize which would crown her position as the mistress of the Near East. These pretensions could not possibly be acquiesced in by Great Britain, and would meet with the relentless opposition of Italy. For similar reasons Italy would not be tolerated either by France or by ourselves. Great Britain, because of her traditional policy and her great Eastern connections, would in some respects be the most suitable heir to the Turk, and the choice would probably be more acceptable than any other to the Eastern world. But the main duties and responsibilities of Britain lie elsewhere ; she will emerge from the war with an increase of obligations which she will with difficulty sustain ; and no British Govern ment would dream of adding to them by the assumption of so vast and perilous a charge. There remains America. This solution has been urged by many, who are not merely anxious that the United States should take their share in bearing the burden of theAmericat'fniarfT f° ^ ^ &lt; ? etactlrnent an ^ presumed disinterestedness of :j' r •*- “ * in nth 'r F el anc ’ * liere ai i e ,m P ortant Sections of opinion in this, and probahlv m other European countries, who would regard the admission of America to the Mediterranean and her installation at the gates of the Eastern and Western world apprehe^d“ C th a fthlT’ an&lt; are 8hared by ° Ur na '’ al authorlt ies, who nresentTv he oil w ^ a PP eara ™ e .&lt;* the American flag in the Mediterranean would Pi i f , * e . y ™ Amenca, 0 navy a nd American coaling stations, involving in the la. t lesort a serious disturbance of the balance of naval power in those waters. 1 ’ • ,, h |' se particular fears are, however, discounted by those who point out that it is in the highest degree unlikely that America would ever either desire or consent to stremrth^h ; r ° Pea t n naVa ‘ \Tu’ and tKat ’ if she did S °’ the &lt;liv ' ision of her 'aval strength that must ensue would be a source rather of weakness than of strength. n e w o e, it seems unlikely tliat America would accept the charge, even if it were offered to her, except possibly in the minor capacity of a mandatory of a future League of Nations ana then only with the attributes, not of an independent ruler, but o an international policeman, appointed to perform certain limited functions of inter national control. Some of the advocates of this solution appear, however, to cherish visions of Constantinople as the future capital of a world-wide League of Nations, whence the controlling and pacifying sceptre of the United States would be wielded over the entire hastern world, of which she would become the universal guardian. m. Ihe successive elimination of the various possible or available Powers brings us to the discussion of the final alternative of some form of international authority ; and, many and obvious as are the objections to a condominium, it may yet be found that, short of keeping the Turk in his capital, this is the only possible alternative. The suggestion of such an authority, on the lines of the Suez Canal Commission, has already been made to his Government by the French colleague of Admiral Webb at Constantinople. Some of the authorities who have favoured the suggestion have argued, upon the analogy Oi the I &gt;anube Commission, which sits at the Roumanian port of Galatz, but exercises no administrative functions ashore, that all that would he required is a body to look after the waterways, to maintain lights, buoys, and pilots, to collect dues, and to exercise a general control over navigation and shipping. Such a solution, it will be found upon examination, postulates, and is meant to postulate, the retention of the Turk. The arguments have already been given which lead many persons to think that this would, on its own merits, be an unmitigated evil. But it mav also be contended that the evil, so far from being mitigated, would be enhanced, were an International Commission to be planted in a city where the Sultan continued -to reside, and of winch, as also of the European hinterland, the sovereignty still remained in his hands. We can easily imagine the atmosphere in which such a Commission (of which there could hardly fail, in these conditions, to be a Turkish member), would pursue its work—an atmosphere of incessant conspiracy and cabal. The wily Turk would revel in such a situation as affording renewed scope to his hereditary talents ; and round the pivot of his own plots would revolve a whirlwind of international intrigue, in which the representatives of all the nations, who still aspired to his inheritance, would eagerly mix. But little reflection, indeed, seems to be needed to show that the Commission and the Sultan could hardly be permanent bed-fellows at Constantinople. Just as the Americans, when providing for the future of the Panama Canal, felt hound to take a zone of land from Panama 5 miles in width on either bank, and to claim powers to appoint a Civil Governor and Civil Courts therein, so an International Commission, sitting in Constantinople, could not, in all probability, do its work, either with advantage or with due authority, unless it also took the capital, the hinterland up to the Chatalja lines, and possibly a strip of territory on either side of the Straits, under its administrative control. • It is not thought that this need raise in any serious form the question of the remoter hinterland either in Europe or in Asia. On the contrary, it is argued that it would promote the pacific solution of that problem on ethnical lines that would satisfy the great majority of the populations concerned.4 o,, .h« p™» p i» b.i»~ might Midia line, which she so stupidly forfeit Fn stern Thrace at Gallipoli and Rodosto, who constitute a majority of the population m F^tern 1 hrace^a ^ It is and in the islands of the Marmora, might be permitt h d t d R |; uman i an8 on even said that M.
