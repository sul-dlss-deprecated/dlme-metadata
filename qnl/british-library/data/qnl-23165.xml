No. 1186/? c January 20, 1937 Dear Stewart I have looked into the question of the police who are on duty at the Agency. There is no correspondence about this My N.C.Os tell me that for about ten years one policeman from the Police Station guard 'Eas been on duty at the Agency and about four years ago, while I was on leave, a second policeman was asked to report for duty daily at the Agency, also from the Police Station guard. The whole arrangement seemed to have been made unofficially. There are only ten men on duty at the Police Station, of these two go to the Agency, one to K.B f s Court, one to the Bahrain Government office and three to the ships, when there is a steamer in the port. The police work, owing to the increase in traffic and other reasons, is increasing and the present duties absorb almost all the police. I am finding it difficult to provide for all duties. In the case of the men at the Agency, if their presence is necessary I will endeavour to provide them but I think it is desirable that they should have definite duties and and no written orders have ever been issued definite —Mb - 2 - definite hours and that if possible they should not be used only for carrying letters but for duties for which police are necessary. I am sorry that there was trouble over policeman Mohomed Tarish, he is an exceptionally unintelligent specimen and I think it was pro bably owing to stupidity not intention.
