As regards Britisn India, the powers undoubtedly exist under Chapter II of the Indian Extradition Act, the procedure oeing laid down in section 3 or section 4. The Extradition Act of 1870 could only affect fugitive criminals of a foreign state wno are in or suspectea of being in any part of His Jajesty f s Dominions or, under section 17, in a ,f BritisH possession”, which is defined in Section £6 as any colony, plantation, island territory or settlement within His Majesty 1 s Dominions. This would therefore seem to exclude the places in the Persian Gulf. A reference to the various orders in Council relating to the Persian Gulf shows that though the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 is made applicable, the Extradition Act 1870 is not. The Indian Extradition Act 1903 is not one of the Indian Acts applied in tne Orders in Council. In the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council 1907, the Maskat Order in Council 1915 and the Bahrein Order in Council 1913, there is a provision that nothing in tne order is to affect the powers or jurisdiction conferred by the (Indian) Foreign jurisdiction and Extradition Act 1879 or in the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council 1902. That Act of 1879 was repealed by the Indian Extradition Act of 1903, and was taerefore not in being’ wnen these Orders in council came into force. As regards the Kuwait Order in Council 1925, the corresponding provision is taat nothing in tne Order shall affect any pow ? er or jurisdiction conferred by the Indian Extradition Act 1903, but in my opinion that is only intended to preserve the rights and powers as regards the surrender of fugitive criminals under the procedure in Chapter III of the Indian Extradition Act, which corresponds to the FugitiveOffenders Act, 1881, There would seem to be no power, so far as I can see, in regard to the places in the Persian Gulf, b}' which a legal extradition order could be made. I suggest that the Foreign Office might be consulted on the point, and if they agree, the information to that effect might be communicated to the U.S.A. Embassy, u.nd the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. (Sd) H.G. Pearson. 22/3/34. Mr. Meath will not presumably have a visa for any of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Gulf, and cannot land without one I doubt if we can do more than instruct the Resident to prevent him from landing and to report at once any information as to his movements. I suggest an alteration in the draft on these lines in which the Foreign Office and their Legal Adviser concur. I think it desirable to repeat the telegram to Aden and to ask the Government of India to authorise the Ohief Commissioner to take any necessary steps. A difficult question arises in the case of Kamdran. I have added a sentence (in wnich the Foreign Office ana Colonial Office concur) to cover this. (Sd) J.G. Laithwaite. 22.3.34.

The first note mentions the Extradition Act 1870, the India Extradition Act 1903, the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 and the various Orders in Council relating to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. The question arose in connection with the famous case of the British-born American financier Samuel Insull (born 1859, died 1938). Following the collapse of his business empire during the Great Depression, Samuel Insull travelled to Europe. In 1934 he was arrested in Istanbul and sent back to the United States of America under an extradition treaty with Turkey, in order to stand trial for fraud and other offences.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Samuel Insull</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Deportation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000179#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
