The correspondents are ministers and senior officials at the Foreign Office, the India Office and the Treasury in London, the Consul and the Vice-Consul at Jeddah, the Governor General of India in Council and the secretaries at the Foreign Department of the Government of India in Calcutta and Simla [Shimla]. They discuss a pay increase in 1913 for the Indian cavass (government servant) Abdul Samad, employed at the Vice-Consulate to provide protection and aid to Indian pilgrims travelling to Mecca and Medina; the seasonal recruitment and rate of pay for a punkah-wallah (manual fan operator) at the Vice-Consulate in 1912; the grant of a personal allowance to Vice-Consul and Assistant Surgeon Dr Abdur Rahman in 1912 and to his predecessors Dr S Muhammad Hussein and Dr Abdur Razzak, in 1905 and 1895 respectively. There is also extensive correspondence between 1909 and 1910 about Foreign Office proposals to increase the fixed annual contribution made from Government of India revenues towards the cost of maintaining the Jeddah Consulate, and a counter proposal from the India Office suggesting that the annual Indian contribution should be reduced.  Included in the correspondence for 1909 is a statistical table showing the total cost of the Jeddah Consulate during the preceding three years (folio 74). The earliest correspondence dates from  1900 and discusses an anticipated reduction in the total amount of annual charges to be transferred from the revenues of India to those of the United Kingdom (also referred to as the Imperial revenues), in view of  the recommendation made by the  Royal Commission on the Administration of Expenditure of India (also referred to as the Welby Commission) about the equal division of charges between the Government of India and the Government of the United Kingdom (also referred to as the Imperial Government).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100029145977.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
