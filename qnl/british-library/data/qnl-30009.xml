BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 5th June, 1939.Monsieur le Ministre, I have been informed by the Govern ment of India that on the evening of the 21st March, (30th Esfand,1317), a party of eight Iranian soldiers crossed the border into British Baluchistan near Ridi, the area lying between the Tokchida, Daridor and Talidan streams in Makran. The party, who were accompanied by a local Baluch named Mohammed son of Hayatan, advanced some five to six miles into British territory and came upon a herd of 50 camels grazing near the Talidar stream, which belonged to one Lalla son of Delmurad, of the Laghor Nohani tribe. 2. The party of Iranian soldiers rounded up the camels and proceeded to drive them in the direction of the frontier, A certain Gohram, son of Pakir Dad, collect ed some men and having sent a message to the Mekran Levy Corps out-post at Mand, set off in pursuit. He and his men came in sight His Excellency Monsieur Muzarfar A*lam. Minister for Foreign Affairs,sight of the Iranian party about H miles from the frontier, whereupon the Iranian soldiers collecting 20 of the fastest camels, crossed the border leaving the remaining 30 camels which were brought back. The hurried collection of camels and the action of the Iranian soldiers in re-crossing the frontier on the appearance of G-ohram and his men indi cates that they knew they were in the wrong. 3* The Government of India have instructed me to protest to Your Excellency at this violation of the frontier and to request that enquiries may be made into the incident and also that the 20 stolen camels may be returned at the earliest possible date or that the sum of Rupees 1000 may be paid as compensation for the loss of the camels* Your Excellency vtill observe that both the violation of the frontier and the theft of the camels were the work of Iranian soldiers and not of private individuals. I therefore trust that Your Excellency will feel able to impress upon the local authorities conoe:med N the necessity for taking such steps as may secure the avoidance of similar incidents in the future.I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.

F, D,4) accompanied by a local Baluch named Mohammad son of Hayatan. They advanced some 5 to 6 miles into British territory and came upon a herd of 50 camels belonging to one Lalla son of Dilmurad, Laghor Nohani, grazing near the Talidar stream. The party rounded up the camels despite the protest of the herdsmen and proceeded in the direction of the frontier. One Gr-ohram son of Fakir Dad collected some men and set off in pursuit at the same time sending a message to the Makran Levy Corps out-post at Mand. G-ohram and his men came in sight of the raiding party about 1£ miles from the frontier whereupon the Nizamis became alarmed and collecting 20 of the speediest camels fled across the border leaving the remining 30 animals which were brought back. The mounted Levy Corps party which turned out immediate ly on receipt of the report arrived too late and having patrolled the frontier in the vicinity for a considerable time returned to the outpost where the statements of the locals concerned were recorded. 2. Ridi though marked on the map as being situated near the frontier is actually the name give to the area lying between the Tokchila, Daridor and Talidar streams and covers a considerable tract of plain. 3. Though the frontier to the west of Mand is not demarcated by actual boundary pillars its whereabouts which are roughly a line running North and South about 14 miles from Hand are well known to the local inhabitants on both sides of the border. The —Mekran Levy Corps resy/£)e party indicates that the Nizamis knew they were in the wrong. 4. There has been considerable movemeat of Nizamis and Amnia forces in the Pi shin ilaqa and it is supposed that they required these camels for transport purposes. 5. It is requested tnat a strong protest may be made to the Iranian G-overnment with regard to this violation of the frontier with a demand for the return of the stolen property or the payment of adequate compensation not less than Rs. 1,000/-. 6. An earlier report of this incident could not be made owing to dislocation of communications with Hand as a result of recent heavy rains. 3d/- L.A.G.

Assistant Political Agent was only accompanied by an xi escort of a few men. He erected a small pillar of loose stones for purposes of taking compass bearings but not as frontier mark. No message was received by him from Iranian Officer at Kandor Sunt, which is presumably the same as Hamdar, as there is no other Iranian post for miles. Incident (b) . Platoon of 25 men of Me&amp;ran Levy Corps was encamped at Begadag from 23rd March to bth April.

I communicated contents orally to head of third Political Section on 25th June urging again that instructions should he sent at once to local authorities and that those responsible for serious incident in your telegram No. 24 shoulu be apprehended and punished promptly. 2. I had previously received an aide-memoire from Ministry oi Foreign Affairs protesting against alleged infractions of frontier near Bikadouk and against arrest there and removal to hand (sic) of Iranian officials on 31st May. Aide-memoire affirmed that R(ikadouk) was in Iranian territory. I said I did not propose to answer this memorandum further as Government of India would not admit for a moment that Bikadouk was outside British Indian territory; their records and whole weight of circumstantial evidence was on their side. 3. To support the above and show our own good faith I re^d extracts from Assistant Political Agent Mekran t s report of 23rd March and gave Monsieur Zanjani a brief written account of his trespass on 16th March.

As regards remedies I urged first that measures Government of India had taken to avoid a. clash should be re ciprocated and mentioned Kandor Bunt as frontier post that we recognised/- v ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter Mo. 1 1 3 Dated l ' JUN Received i 8 Ju 1iMC2 . 1327. reco£^iised as being in Iranian territory s secondly I reverted to my previous suggestion that a small party should meet and fix places for pillars in Kastag plain. If Iranian authorities favoured this I would put it to you as also my suggestion that chief person deputed for this work on each side should be from headquarters and not connected with recent incidents. 5. Monsieur Zanjani emphasised that there was no map which decided incontestably in whose territory certain places including Bikadouk lay; he agreed as to need of avoidance of further incidents; he took note of my suggestions and thought that agree ment could be reached more easily if Government of India pending agreement on frontier line would withdraw their announced determina tion to make further arrests. I disagreed as to this and said that there was no hope of your altering your intention but that if Iranian authorities agreed to survey parties meeting to determine frontier and took prompt steps to punish those responsible for serious incident I would ask you to enjoin continued patience on the part of our authorities in Baluchistan. This telegram has not been repeated to Baluchistan. (N. F.3. D.S.F. J.3. U.3.F. k U.D.)

About the 17th May Umar received a message from across the border infoming him that Mir Hamza had been xia called upon to fulfil his bond, in anticipation of the visit of Naib Durrani.

On the 28th May 1938 a report was received by the Post Officer, Mand, that four Iranian subject (Qadirdad, Dost FGhamndd, Adam and Behram) residents of Pishin in Iran stole a camel and fled with it towards Mand. They were pursued the following day by Naib Durrani with a party of Nizamis and a few local Baluch trackers. The pursuit party did not stop at the border, but pursued the thieves to Chitkal, a place about half a mile on the British side of the border near Shah llurad Chah. They opened fire on the theives and in the ensuing fight Dost Mohammad and Adam are Relieved to have been killed and Qadirdad and w Behram wound ed. The pursuit party then retired towards Pishin taking the dead and wounded men with them, 3. in view of Naib Durrani^ recent activities on and across the border, it is suggested that if there he no objection the Iranian Government may be reminded that the principle of ’hue and cry* across this particular part of the frontier was abandoned several years ago and that pursuit parties are not entitled to follow offenders across the border.pp Telegram R No * 98, dated (and reed) 29th June 1933* From*,* ^ *...Baluchistan, Ziarat* To* c ..o...** Foreign, Simla* (Repeated to Tehran).

I was accordingly ln;truet;d to moke a strong protest to the IrAniwan Government.

(a) wS regards the first. Monsieur Buis’ oompl int to His Majesty's Minister in December last, it seemed probable that a misunderstanding hud arisen in connexion with has tag. X showed monsieur iuonj ni on J&amp;pt^in Lovett's map of July, 1871, that ..astug Till was oleurly in Iranian territory, bat that the haet^g river and pi in were partly in Iran c»nd partly In British B&amp;luohist n. The Government of India had satisfied them selves that the parsia© of levies to which Monsieur Hais’ complaint probably referred hud not gone beyond the British portion. (b) Secondly there were the Government of India's complaints. X showed Monsieur tanjual on jao ther map, issued by idw? rd Jt nford for the Ordnance jurvey, both ^ipal and illunl aunt m rked clearly in British Baluchis- ton. The Government of India had nob wished to stress unduly the first two incidents referred to in my aide- mdmoire, vhioh they were prepared to believe h;ad been unpremedlated and accident.1. But they could not / poeeibljr-&gt; 3 — poa^ibX^ oTcrlook tha third iacident, which hud involved not onlj? violation of frontier, bat the abduction of ^ritlsh*Xndiiei sabjecte* They felt bound to ask thu,t appropriate steps should be t sken urgently by the local ^ otherities. Meanwhile they h d deemed it neoessary to authorise s detachment of Mekran levies to move into the British portion of the Mas tag pi in* (a) thirdly there were the two incidents about which monsieur Znnjt ni hud spoken to the noting Oriental aeoretniy to die Majesty’s legation on the previous day* 1 said that X had iamediut^ly telegraphed to the Govern ment of India asking that enquiries mi ht be m de* d* I said that we had some reason to think that the incidents that we ooapalined of were due to &amp; gentle man known locally as the ' fiilb Durrani , who was apt to be Qver-?erlou8,&lt;ind perh ps ^JLso the indeflnlteness of the frontier. In such c nditions elsewhere it was the usual and prudent practice for the armed forces of both aides normally to observe a a rgln of safety,and this was uou.lly sufficient to avoid incidents, what the Government of India could not tolerate was farther incidents like the third one recorded in my aide-ifdaoire. If it was necessary in order to avoid repetitions the frontier in the kasti*g plain could be demaOo&amp;ted and X gathered that the erection of some four pillars by sm 11 survey parties would be sufficient. $• a few days 1 ter X received &amp; telegram from the Qorenmmt of India reporting yet another incident, as a result of which one Iranian cifloer and five troops had been rrested on the 31st May for having crossed the /borderborder* Z teX a graphed la reply th f . t I atlol^ted thut when the f otn wera oomiaoaloatad to the Minlfttry of foreign Affaire, aa wain eugipeted, they wo aid enquire as to the fate of the men * rrested.

The vakil instead of returning it impounded the whole flock and the goatherd and took them to Pi shin, on the ground that the place (Shah Murad Chah) where the goats had been grazing belonged to Iran Government and that the goathered was ori ginally an Iranian subject who had transferred his allegiance to the British. edi 3. When the owner, Umar, heard this, he at once proceed/ to Pi shin to retrieve his goats. In reply to his request the vakil of Pa shin made the extra-ordinary remark that as the goats had been grazing within the boundary of Iran, they be longed to Iran Government. Umar was thereupon arrested and offered the choice of accepting Iranian nationality or being | sent to Chahbar* He called the bluff and refused. g 4. The Iranian Officer then counted the goats and findiry that there were 100, offered to return them in eBchange for a fine of Rs. 45/- This was eventually reduced to Rs.25/- was paid®****was paid by !r Mir Hamza, and the goats were released. Taking these 100 goats with him Umar went to Qadir Dad (see para 2 above) and demanded the 36 goats which had pre viously been concealed by him in order to ©duce the amount of fine. Qadirdad refused to return the goats on the plea* that the fact had come to the knowledge of the vakil .Umar then himself went to the vakil and requested him to order Qadir Dad to return the 36 goats but the vakil declined to do so. Umar then returned to Shah Murad Chah with 100 goats. 5. The next day (16th April 1938) Mir Hamza s/o Mohd caste Barr resident of Pi shin sent a message to Umar to come and try to effect the recovery of the remaining goats. Omar complied with the message and Mir Hamza took him to the vakil of Pi shin. The vakil ordered the 36 goats to be released on payment of a further fine of Rs.6/-. The fine was paid by Mix ^ir Hamza in consideration of which he kept 2 goats, and the remaining 34 goats were broughtk back to Shah Murad Chah by Umar. Of the remaining 14 goats according to Umar's statement, 1 was slaughtered by Iranian Sepoys, 3 were devoured by Jackals and 10 are still missing. 6.

Baluchistan Express letter of May 10th has not yet reached me so I have been unable to include incident there described* I will mention io later© 2. Meanwhile Ministry of Foreign Affairs have for their part requested enquiries regarding the following alleged incidents:- (a) 100 British-Indian troops under an Officer and accompanied by one Kerbelai Panj Ali are alleged to have crossed into Iran territory on March 19th near Bikadcuk. They are stated to have . advanced towards Iran frontier post at Hamdar and to have laid down frontier marks between the two above-mentioned places. Iranian Officer at Hamdar sent a message to them to the effect that frontier was not on the line marked by them. (b) it is claimed that on April 9th 70 British-Indian soldiers crossed the frontier and established a post at Bikadouk. An Lanian Officer from Chahbahar accompanied by the head of the Customs there went to Bikadouk and in reply to his enquiry was told that according to the map that place was in British territory and established post had been ordered by the Government of India. Officer-in-Charge of the post is said to be Jemadar Muhabullah and apparently he is accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent. 3.

My Lord Marquess, With reference to my telegram Lo«41 of the 31st May, I have the honour to enclose herein copies of the aide-memoire which I handed in at the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 1st June, on the subject of the frontier incidents in Baluchistan which Your Excellency had instructed me to bring to the attention of the Iranian Government* 2* I had hoped to see Monsieur Mohsen Rais, but as he was unable to arrange an appointment for me, I interviewed Monsieur Zanjani, the Acting Head of the Third Political Department. I atppinted out that the frontier troubles in Southern Baluchistan had now fallen into three parts. 3. As regards the first, Monsieur rtais 1 complaint to His Majesty f s Minister in December last, it seemed probable that a misunderstanding had arisen in connexion with Kastag. I showed Monsieur Zanjani on Captain Lovetts map of July, 1871, that Kastag village was clearly in Iranian territory, but that the Kastag river and pl^n were partly in Iran and partly in British Baluchistan* The Government of India had satisfied themselves that the srties of levies to which Monsieur Rais* complaint probably referred had not gone beyond the British portion. 4* Secondly, there were the Government of India*s complaints. I showed Monsieur Zanjani on another map, issued by Edward Stanford for the Ordnance Survey, both Pipal and Pilani Sunt marked clearly in British Baluchistan. The Government of India had not wished to stress unduly the first two incidents referred to in my aide- memoire, which they were prepared to believe had been unpremediated and accidental. But they could not possibly overlook the third incident, which had involved not only violation of frontier, but the abduc^tion of British-Indian subjects. They felt bound to ask /that His Excellency, The Govern or-General in India, External Affairs Department, Simla*that appropriate steps should be taken urgently by the local authorities• Meanwhile they had deemed it necessary to authorise a detachment of Mekran levies to move into the British portion of the Kastag plain . 5* Thirdly there were the two incidents about which Monsieur Zanjani had spoken to the Acting Oriental Secretary to His Majesty’s Legation on the previous day. I said that I had already telegraphed to Your Excellency asking that enquiries might be made* but I had failed to find the villages he had named, Bikadouk and Kamdar, marked on any map. 6. I said that we had some areas on to think that the incidents that we complained of were due to a gentleman known locally as the 'Haib Durrani', who was apt to be over-zealous, and perhaps also the indefiniteness of the frontier. In such conditions elsewhere it was the usual and prudent practice for the armed forces of both sides normally to observe a margin of safety, and this was usually sufficient to avoid incidents. What the Grovemroent of India could not tolerate was further incidents like the third one recorded in my aide-memoire. If it was necessary in order to avoid repetitions the frontier in the Kastag plain could be demarcated, and I gathered that the erection of some four pillars by small survey parties would be sufficient. 7. Monsieur Zanjani was grateful that I had telegraphed to Your Excellency the Ministry of Foreign Affair* request for enquiries into the Bikadouk and Hamdar incidents, and promised to ask urgently that similar enquiries should be ma-de into our complaints. I have the honour to be. My Lord Marquess, Your Excellency*s, most obedient servant, Sd/- $. Butler.1219. Telegram II H No.51, dated (and reed) 17th June 1938, From........Butler, Tehran.

I arrived on the afternoon of ttfrr 16th March and spent the fbllow- ii% two days in the vicinity* During trie time I was there the Iranians left me severely alone and no patrolling was carried out from their recently established Post at Kandor Sunt. 3. The Kastag plain la of considerable extent 9 and the pocket it forms in the hills is the only cultivable area on this part of the Frontier between the Mand and Coastal Plains. Granted rain the area would be quite fertile 9 and evidences of a larger karez are still to be seen at Kahn-i-dalld s the / gracing is good 9 and there are several hundred date palms at Begadag-i-Kunar about 120 of which bear fruit. Two Important camel roads pass through the plain and cross the frontier within its limits 9 namely Mand to Bahu-Kalat and Pish in to Gwadur via Sunt oar. The latter is of particular interest to the Iranians owing to the quantity of trade which passes along It. 4. It was in order to establish a customs post on the Pishln-Gwadur trade route that a party set out from Pishin early in February 1938 headed by Mir m Iraniwmmmm L ( 2 ) Mir mI rani* This man who Is better known mM n Naib Ilurrani ,, la chief Ajnnieh for tha Piehin, Bahu t Kalat, Kaiiiinaan and G wet ter areas 9 and la directly responsible to the Raifi-i-Sakhilo of Chahbar. He is an impetuous 9 hot headed bully who la reliably reported to have killed 26 men out of hand near Chahbar some six months ago on Hie gi*ounds that they were carrying arms* hia party in this instance included llirs Kenegl and Humsa 9 mo tab ira of piahin* On arrival at Kandor bunt the motabirs refused to accompany the party any further and renoved their baggage from the camels v stating that If Kalb Durrani carried out his Intention of proceeding to Bagadag-i-kunar (where I later camped) and establishing a tn&amp;na there, they would not be responsible as the place was In British territory* Reluctctttly Raid Durrani consented to establish the post at KandSr sunt for the time being, and himself set off for Gwetter to bring rations and re info roe- manta • Before leaving he gave orders to the effect Uiat patrolling should be carried out to Begadag and Pipal on alternate days • It is this patrolling across the frontier line which has given rise to all the recent incidents in Kastag (see para 8 below) with exception of the first viz the alleged looting o f vUfoa Khan's goods by Nisamis on 3rd November 1937 • 5* Matters came to a head when Incident No* 4 was reported and it is in Uils connection that I commend for your favourable consent the re stained but fim action taken by Captain G*P*M* Shipway, Adjutant Uekran Levy Corps* I myself was absent in Sibi attending the agent to the Governor General's Durbar, when this report of the beating cf a Kalat State subject in British territory by Niaamls made it clear that some action had to be taken* Having concentrated about 130 men of the Hekran Levy Corpe at Kend in the ordinary course of rmlirnfm and collective training, h1 (3) he kept them there on the plea of quarantine due to mumps, at the same time he advanced one platoon to Flpal with orders to pitch tents in a conspicuous position and patrol dally to Begadag via Pllanl Cunt (all places being indisputably in British territory). Iranian patrolling stopped immediately and news of the arrival of this platoon was despatched to Naib Durrani who left Gwetter at once on his return Journey after reporting the matter to Chahbar. However I was informed In S untsar t and later in Kast££, that he was stopped in Bahu-Kalst by a camel sowar who brought orders to the effect that he should not proceed until receipt of further orders, b• There the matter rested until the day before my arrival (15.3.38) when an Iranian aeroplane openly flew over British territory several miles Inside the frontier, searching either for my party ( I had spread news of my coming in tiie hope that some one would meet me) or else for their own post at handor Sunt, over which they eventually dropped a message. It is reported, though not confirmed, that a HaJ dan, an Iranian military officer of some rank, was in the aeroplane and that in his message he first ordered the Kandor Bunt post commander to interfere in no way with my party and to cease patrolling, and then stated that he himself was on his way to Karachi, that he would return to Gwetter on 23rd March 1938 and hoped to arrive at Kandor S unt on or about 2nd April 1938 (the latter part of this message was reported to you in my telegram No. Camp 101 dated 80 th March 1938). 7. Before discussing the alleged incidents in detail will you please refer to the inaccurate •memory* sketch appended. I regret that I had neither the time nor the instruments to produce a better sketch. The inaccuracy of the H degree sheet' as publisrhea by a.e Survey Department has already been pointed(4) pointed out by Lti coli (then Captain) Keyee In the memorandum attached to his confidential letter No* 2 dated 3rd April 1913* With the help of this &gt;V memorandum however 9 and Major St* John^ detailed description and map forwarded with your endorsement l*.

and to Suntaar, for this road goes nowhere near Kaetag* The goods were obviously being sent to Iran and were probably being smuggled* 1 very much regret that this incident was ever reported to you as a matter warranting a protest to and explanation by the Iranian Government* Incident No* k - the alleged forcible removal of four hens and twenty two chlttal mats from the house of Bango and Nur Johd Laghor motabirs, by Nizamis on or about 9th February 1938 (probably slightly later) reported to you in the telegram forwarded with my endorsement No* IB-C dated 23rd February 1938* The house was situated in Homan Kaur shown as '2' in my sketch* lifter much persuasion these two men admitted the incident, but insisted that the hens were paid for, and begged that, as they had property in Pishin (Iran) and feared reprisals, no representations should be made • I consider that their request should be respected as far as possible, but their evidence (Stateiaents a *nd B attached) ie valuable••••( 6 ) ,r\ Utvm.— valuable in that It teatiriee to two definite occasions on which armed Iranian patrols entered British territory* I particularly asked for names and they identified Sirjoga Hassan (cooxnandlng the patrol) and sepoys Hussain, Baqir and Haeean on two occasions* They stated that they were wearing blue grey uniforms and that on tne second occasion were accompanied by one Bahram son of Gohram a resident of teand *ho is playing 'dudas' in Iran these days* The second occasion la connected with Incident No* 4 below* Both Eango and Nur Mohd have w *&gt; now moved tneir housed further jtfouth to satigi-Klap where they will not be troubled by tnese visits while residing in our territory* incident no* 3* The alleged interference by Nizamis with Motabir Kalamail who was cultivating land, reported with my endorsement No* 15-C, dated 27 th Februaiy 1938* His statement is attacned and will be found at C* Although the land which he chose to plough after rain had fallen, lies only a few hundred yards inside the Frontier, ( r, 3 M on iqy sketch) yet I consider that such a high-handed action on the party of an Iranian patrol commander is lnexcusable&lt; I have taken a photograph showing the position of these fields, and should it be successful, a copy will follow* One Gaza Beg son of Miar, Hind Baioch was a witness of this Incident* Being a wise man, Kalamali decided to finish his ploughing ana allow the question of payment of dah yak to stand over until the crop materialized* Incident No* 4* alleged beating of &amp;alik Dad a Kalat state subject in British territory by a patrol of Nizamis, as yet unreported* This Incident occurred early this month* The patrol was on it© way from Kancior Sunt to Pipal.

( 8 ) navigation wnich any pilot might make In such country; socond that y If consiaered necessary y the denial conUdned in ny endorsenent 17-C of 27 th February 1928 be suitably expanded; third that It be finaly pointed out the Eastern part of the Kaste^ plain lies in British territory and that although there is no objection to the Kandor Sunt garrison buying supplies from Kalat State subjects y they »nust not cross the frontier In armed parties to (V&gt; so; and last that protests be forwarded to and an explanation den^anded frora the Iranian Government in regard to the incidents Nos* 3 and 4 1 particularly the latter. ID. F u tur e ar rangeme n ts. I withdrew the Pipal platoon to hand when I left Kastag on 19 th inarch 193B y leaving one man to report any renewal of patrolling and point out the frontier line as recognised to the , in coming platoon. The now platoon leaves M&amp;nd to-day with orders to camp at Begedag-i-Kunar for a fortnight and patrol uaily to Pipal. All have been cautioned against crossing the frontier and interfering in any way with the reconnais&amp;ance party on 2nd April 1938 should it materialize (which is rather doubtful). Unless I he&amp;r to the contrary from you and unless the situation demands otherwise this platoon will be withdrawn on 6th April soxl replaced by weekly and later by monthly patrols .Is hould be guld to near that you approve of these arrangements. I would endorse the s uggeetion made by Cols Keyes in 1913 that the Kastag Plain should be refliappsd in greater detail, a small survey party only would be required y and if four small pillars could be erected with their help y and subsequently agreed to, the matter would be settled for ever.FlnalJLy x-o anticipate the inevitable 11 . protest that between l«ith and lath I arch 1938 a party of British Inuian sepoys accompanied by a British officer, Hicaldar and severva r'otablrs, violated the irontier and ^ere seen wandering in Iranian territory, I would state tn&amp;t tne only time my party entered Iranian territory was on the evening of ifctn harch* hb stated in para 7 above, my first reconnaissance was made from the surrmlt of 'a* and from there, being in some doubt as to the identity of 'a” and m b m I went south to M D' via trie Kastag Knur, inspecting site Ho. 1 enroute. ho fnztmla or locals were encountered.

It seams clear from t ,e report of the Assistant Political Agent,Hokran datoti tne 23rd of March 19 -.j 8 that the complaint made by Mon sieur Mohsen Rais, regarding the violation of the frontier by a party of thirty British Indian soldiers under a Risaldar vide your despatch under reference, was unfounded. On the otner hand, tnere appears to be little doubt that small par ties of Iranian soldiers have .iolatod our frontier on at least four occasions, not to Mention the case of the Iranian aeroplane referred in p.iragraph 6 of tiie Assistant Political Agent, Uakran’s memorandum. Against this has to be set off the fact that tne Assistant Political Agent, Makran himself violated the frontier with hie _&gt;arty before he ^aa aware of its exict &gt;oaition. 2.

My dear Minister, Your Excellency’s note of Dey 5th (December 27th, 1935) regarding Gorich Kalag was duly received. I believe that through the explanations which were given to you by Monsieur Motamedy on Dey 4th (December 26th, 1935) by my direction concerning the views of the Imperial Government in this connection, the matter has become entirely clear, namely, that although in the map of 1313 of Hfcjira (1896 A.D.) the location of Gorich Kalag was shown to be within the British Baluchistan, nevertheless in view of the statements made by the inhabitants of the place to the effect that during this period they have been paying taxes to the Iranian Government and also in view of the fact that some mistake may have been made in comparing the land with the map, my Government, without wishing to doubt Your Excellency’s statements or the good-will of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, have thought it fit, with a view to throwing light on the actual locality of Gorich Kalag and obtaining accurate information as to the condition of those places, to send two or three men (officials ?) to the place who may, by considering the map and agreement and comparing same with the land, make the necessary examinations and notify the result. There will, therefore, be no necessity for the Government of India also to send officials to the place to form a commission, but it will suffice to agree to the despatch of Iranian officials to the place in question and, /as- 2 as Your Excellency has promised to bring tbe views of the Imperial Government to the notice of the competent quarters, I am awaiting the result of your steps in this connection and also in respect of the recalling of forces from the frontier line, in order that I may take action with the Ministry of War of my Government with a view to withdrawing the remaining forces who have been sent to those regions as a result of the presence of forces there. Telegraphic instructions have also been given to Monsieur Ala to explain the views of the Imperial Government in London in the above sense and take action for obtaining the result. There were certain points in Your Excellency’s note under reply about which I wish to give explanations: 1. In the course of our conversation on Dey 2nd (December 24th, 1935) I informed Your Excellency that with a view to finding out the actual locality and comparing the place with the existing map it has been decided that certain officials should be sent to the place, a matter to which I have also alluded in ray note of Dey 3rd (December 25th, 1935) and the statement made in your note saying that I have not made any verbal statement on the matter is no doubt based on misunderstanding. 2. I am for my part sorry that the administrative (official ?) information which was supplied to me regarding the agreement reached in sending a commission was based on some misunderstanding, 3. ith regard to the last paragraph of Your Excellency’s note under reply, I find it necessary to point out the fact £]M±XfclX*SKXBXkyX±HX&amp;igKXSS£ail8XaKX&amp;&amp;JCXgll&amp;x£jfiSKKKfe!(XX£££fe¥ that it was only in compliance with Your Excellency’s request, made in the course of our verbal discussions on Dey 2nd (December 24th, 1935) and also in the note of Dey 3rd (December 25th, 1935) and with a view to avoiding any /possiblepossible difficulties that instructions were issued to the officials of the place and I cannot, therefore, understand how such a sentence might give rise to misinterpretation# Yours sincerely, (Signed) Bagher Kazemi.0 875 1st %}»nuar:y# 1*36 My dear iini*ter f any taanks for Your xcellenoy’a letter Ifo* 42703/3330 of December 30th (oey 3thj regarding the question of Oorich Kalag, which you were kind enough to send me by the hand of Konsieur Motamedy. 2. I nawe slightly delayed answering because I nave since received various telegrams from tfew Delhi and the kesiaency at &amp;ibi # British Baluchistan, wnich throw more light on the matter. If, before dealing with the points in /your his excellency Monsieur B. Kasemi, Minister for foreign Affairs.your letter, I may give Your excellency the substance of these telegrams I thine Your i.xcellency will find that much of the misunder* standing is explained. The Government of j ndia inform me that they have received the following particulars from British Baluchistan;- A detachment of one platoon of i ekran levies was sent to Oorich Kalag on December 2nd (Axor 10th) where they carried on normal field training. To avoid any difficulty they were instructed not to approach within one mile of the actual frontier line, which was carefully indicated to them on the ground by the Adjutant of the Corps, who visited the locality himself and took compass bearings. on December l&amp;th (Asar 23rd) a party of fifteen /Iranians/ / /Iranians / / 5 - Iranians including soldiers arrived at Kuhafc from Mzxaic ana asKed turn permission of the subordinate official on tne British side to visit Gorieh Kalag. The official in question gave provisional assent but on deoewber 16th (Asar i^4th) the Assistant political Agent himself went to the place and found that the Iranian party had only come as far as boundary pillar No. 3, from wnloh point they had viewed Gorich Kalag. The same evening the Assistant political Agent received a message (as far as I understand, an oral message) from Kuhak implying that the Iranian authorities were satisfied that Gorich Kalag was on the British side of the frontier but stating also that as its revenue had always been collected by Iranians the matter was being referred to higher authority and that in the meanwhile the- 4 - Iieniano would not come tnere. Thltt meuaage reached tde authorities on the British side from tor-ud-Din, head of the one family which resides at Goricn Kalag. The statement regarding payment of taxes to the Iranian authorities was thereupon investigated. Afur-ud-pin in fact admits to the British authorities that revenue nag always been paid to the Iranian authorities at Kuhax for the reason that when the boundary pillars were erected no orders were given to pay to any different authority in future. Further investigation on this point by the irltish authorities has shown that the information Is correct. The ritls^ authorities ha&lt;l been unaware of this but it is to be explained by the fact that Gorioh Kalag is in the Xharan territory and there is in Garich Xal&amp;g only one /revenue- 6 - revemie paying inliabitant. Th« place is considerably nearer to Kuhak than to &lt;;ra*ag which is the nearest Levy post on the British side. The Chief of Knaran has probably not thought it worth while to incur the trouble end expense of collecting a trifling sum in revenue from a place fully a weex's larch from nie head quarters. 4. I have also made enquiries regarding the supposed erection of •’fortifications'' to which Monsieur ^otaaedy referred. As a result I learn tnat no fortifications worthy of the name have been erected, in fact nothing more than a perimeter camp with a picket post. Your Ijcoellcncy may rest assured that such works could in no sense constitute any danger or threat to the Iranian aide of the frontier. 6 Let me now return to Your /Excellency f s- 6 - Excellency *» letter. In tne ligiat of tine adaitional information whlei* X have given above I *aucn doubt enether Your xcellency will still wish to pursue your suggestion of further investigation on the spot* If it is exact, as I have informed Your Excellency above, that an Iranian party fro«a Kuhak have already viewed Oarich i ^lag from j&amp;ounaary rillar ho. 5 on the fontier and expressed them selves as satisfied tuat it is on the British side, nothing Tarther would appear necessary* iioverthelese, as suggested to his excellency Monsieur Ala in .ondon, it is always open to the Iranian Government to send officials as far as the frontier to examine whether or not Gorlch Kalag is to be found on the Iranian side of the boundary* But in that case, as already stated, my Government would /requirerequire that the Iranian party should not cross the frontier or in any way risk further complications. 6. Should the Iranian Govern ment still desire to proceed with this project, I snail be happy to inform the Government of India in order that the authorities on the British side aay he aware of the fact. ?. iith regard, to the question of withdrswol of troops on both sides I note that Your i-xcellency is awaiting information from me in order that you »ay take action with the Ministry of var with a *iew to with drawing the regaining forces which have been despatched to that district es a result of the presence of forces on the other side. As stated In ®y previous, letter, the forces sent by /thethe Iranian authorities were despatch ed under a wisappr^heaaion. This, I think, is now clear to both sides. Indeed I nave today learned that the authorities on the British side ol' the frontier understand that orders have been given for certain troops to be withdrawn from Kuhak. As I stated in wy letter of December 27th (Dey 6thj I am confident that, if tnese withdrawals have in fact taken place, the British force will be reduced to normal* I am enquiring by telegram of the Government of India what action is being taken. 6. At the end of Your excellency's letter you were good enough to deal wita three small points on which misunderstandings had arisen, I feel tnat, in the fact of the further information which I have now been able to provide, it is unnecessary to pursue these points /andand I would confine myself to tnanking Your i.xcellency for thus assisting in clearing up misunderstandings wnicn I regret should nave arisen and which 9 I reel, can now he regarded as no longer in existence.

(Signed) H.M. Knatchbull-Hugessen. His Excellency Monsieur B. Kazemi, Minister for Foreign AffairsTranslation: Pro'n the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Third Political Department) addressed to His Majesty s Minister No. 42107 dated Dey 3rd, 1314 (25th December, 1935) My dear Minister, Your Excellency’s note of December 25th 1935 regarding the location of Gorich (Gorij?) and Kalak (?) was duly received. 2. As I informed Your Excellency the other day, with a view to ascertaining the actual location of the said place and comparing it with the map which is now available it has been decided that certain representatives should be sent to the place. Instructions have, therefore, been given to the competent authorities to abstain from taking any action in the place until the said representatives arrive and the result of their views is made known. 3. With regard to the statement made in Your Excellency’s note under reply to the effect that in view of the presence of a number of military at Kouhak situated in Iranian territory and in tne vicinity of the frontier it is feared that some difficulties may arise, I find it necessary to bring to Your Excellency’s notice the fact that the reason for sending military to Kouhak was due to the action which was taicen by the other party by bringing a number of men (military ?) to the regions of Gorich and Kalak without warning. 4. Therefore, I am awaiting effective action to be taken by Your Excellency by withdrawing this number of men from the place to their quarters and restoring the normal situation. 'i Yours sincerely, (Signed) B. Kazemi.Brtti&amp;li nation, T&gt;«oeea'aer *?th f 19^5• y &lt;l«ar Inistor, I received this afternoon Your ^coiloney* e private letter of i^ember H 5 th liunberad 4^10? ra^arCin^ Qorleh rala ^ 9 i« which you stato that it has bean decided that certain representatives should be sent to the place and that instruct Ions have been ^ivan to the competent authorities to abstain from taiUii^ any action there until the said representatives arrive and the result of their views are made fcnom. I would His 3toelleiSy Monsieur B.Kazewi i inlatsr tor For.t^, Affalro.mmm ■■ -2- I would man tIon incidentally that Your Excellency did not t a* stated in your letter, inform me of this in our conTorsation of December ^4th t but according to my certain recollection, stated that you understood that I had agreed to the appointment of a Mixed Commission to examine the locality on the spot. In saying this Your !£ceelleney no doubt had in mind a conversation which I had with Monsieur Sohelly on December , 3rd in which I gave His Excellency full particulars as to the situation of Gorich JC&amp;l&amp;g, which is indisputsb ly on the British side of the frontier. Your excel lency's impression that in that con versation l had agreed to the appoint ment of a nixed Commission to examine the locality in question was due to * ito a nisunder&amp;t&amp;ndlug, as 1 explolood at the tino. Xoxuc 'Excellency will (XjLdsJi fik+k J reriefaber that I certain that ny A vQV*rxm*n\ woula never a^,ree to aueh a proposal, on lecember 26th in the course of a private conversation roneieur Behelly informed me that a mlsunderatariding had in fact arisen and that it was &amp;s a result of a conversation held at the Foreign Office by His ? 3 xeellency the Iranian Mniater in London that Your Excel lency had understood that Kls Majesty's Government were in agreement with tills proposal. From a telegraphic report of the conversation in question which I have just received from the Foreign Ofiice it la clear that in this case also there has been a serious mis understanding[ r understanding. Hla Majesty*» Govern- »ent have agreed to no such thing, on the contrary Monsieur Ala was informed at the Foreign Offiee that there seemed to be no oaae for a Comeieeion: that there wae no doubt as to the true position of Oorich Kalag and that the frontier was clearly defined by a formal agreement and is quite unaia- takeable. It was further pointed out to His excellency that the situation of Qorich K&amp;l&amp;g {which it appears la one place and not two as is suggested in your letter) on the British side of the frontier, which is in any ease plain from the map and from the course of the streams near it, has been most carefully verified by the British authorities. it was also pointed out to him that, in the absence of any pri *a facie ease to shew-5- show that the position or the frontier were in serious couit, a commission would he quite tine si led for and the Oorernwent of India eould not possibly he expected to accept it* Monsieur Ala was at the same time infer aieci that there was no reason why the local Iranian authorities should not go up to the clearly established frontier line as defined in the Koldlch Agreeiaent and as reoognlsfihlo in the light at the naps, thus seeing for themselves on the spot that the post Is not in Iranian territory* it was however made clear that they must on no account cross ths frontier or risk an incident and the hopo was reseed, that strict instructions would be 3 *nt to that effect to the Officer _/ - 6 - Officer Commanding the Iranian troops whose recent concentration at kuhafc has already caused justifiable uneasiness* I trust that the above statement of the true views of His Majesty 9 s Government will serve to remove any misu derstaiding. It is probable that Monsieur Ala’s report did not reach Your Excellency till after your letter to me of December 2Gth hac been despatched. in any case ray conversation of December 26th with Monsieur Mot&amp;medy (who did not mention that Your Excellency had written to me on the previous day) may also have served to clear up the matter. v or the sake of complete certainty however I will repeat that my Goverznent ooosicer first that # in view of the indisputable evidence 'hiekiwhich exists as to the exact situation of Oorlch kalas, a commission woult bo quite unofelled for : eeoondljr they see no reason why the local Iranian authorities should not go up to the frontier line as established by the Hoxdloh /greement and thus see for theae elves that the post is not in Iranian territory but thirdly that they must on no acoou t cross the frontier or risk an incident. fcith regard to Your Sxeelleney's further reference to the presence of military foroea in the neighbourhood I was happy to note the aseuranee given me by Your Excellency in our conversation of iHMonber 24th that stringent orders had boon sent to the looei Iranian authorities to avoid any clash or incident and I was glad to receive confirmation of this from MonsieurMonaleur \ahen he called on M on Tour }^xc«ll»ncy* b instructionc on Deoeraher 26th. I note, ho*'eyer t that in your letter Your ^oellency atateis that the reason for the despatch of an Iranian military force to Kuhak was due to the despatch of a force by the British authorities to Oorioh IC&amp;l&amp;g. it seems necessary to bear in mijsd that the Iranian force was despatched to Kuhak when the Iranian iHnrermaent were u:der the false injr ession that CfOrich Kalag woa on the Iranian side of the botuidary* This impresaion has been shown by imisputffc le proofs to be mistaken* The reason therefore for the presence of the Iranian troops has disappeared and their further retention could not fail to produce the worst possible Impression on His Majesty* ^ ePn . went-9- meat auttL the cover urn* at of Irtoiiu X am ooafideat that as soon as the Iranian force has been withdrawn the British arc© will be reduced to normal* in conclusion, I fear that my fjovernraent would find it difficult to explain to themselves the trus neaning of the remark in the second paragraph of your excellency's letter that the competent 'uthor- ities have received instructions to abstain from 'taking any action** until the Iranian represents!! ves arrive and the result of their views Is made known* I feel it i possible entirely to disregard this observation which, in the face of the explanations and proofs which, 589 {_ 1936 Decypher, Mi', ICnatchbull-Hugessen (Tehran), 21st January, 1936.

The 2 days delay on the part of Ministry of Mar in communicating with Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to enable Minister for Foreign Affairs to answer my letter may be due to mere administra tive incompetence and it would be difficult to prove deliberate neglect. In any case I do not think Ministry of Foreign Affairs are to blame, Motamedy must have enquired of Ministry of War on first possible moment after conversation reported in my telegram No. 14 to Government of India. 2. But I would make following comments (i) In spite of verbal assurances reported in last sentence of 3-3 &gt; my telegram No. 10 to Government of India, Iran officials have been - sent to the frontier. (ii) Our offer made in reply to Minister for Foreign Affair's request for facilities has been ignored. (iii) It seems more than probable that Persian Government intended to say no more and were hoping affair would die a natural death. 5. I am aware of views expressed in last paragraph of your telegram No. 1 with which I still agree. I feel that to make much . of their behaviour would risk creating ill-feeling which might affect other issues. But I do not think we can overlook their conduct.4, It would be desirable in the first instance to have report from Baluchistan as to what has actually taken place on the frontier or at Gorich Kalag. .out when that has been received perhaps you would consider sending for Persian Idnister. Alternatively we might answer the original Iranian note (see Mr* Mallet’s telegram No. 271). It will be remembered that all subsequent correspondence has been private. 5.

In continuation of my endorsement No.5649 dated Xfts the 7th December 1935 I forward herewith copies of two jr reports Nos. 63-C dated the 6th December 1935 and 66-C dated the 12th December 1935 which have now been received from the Assistant Political Agent Mekran, describing the situation at Gorich Kalag. I forward also copy of a telegram No.1651 dated the 15th December 1935 which I received yesterday. 2. There is no need at the moment for me to comment on the two reports by the Assistant Political Agent, since the situation in regard to Gorich Kalag has been described verbally to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General. In regard to the telegram I consider that the Sarhaddar blundered badly in agreeing to an armed Iranian party visiting Gorich Kalag and I am informing the Assistant political Agent Mekran that should he or any officer subordinate to him on any future occasion receive a request for permission for armed Iranian troops to enter territory which he is satisfied is British, he should reply that he has no authority to give such permission and that such matters must be arranged between the two Governments. As our occupation of Gorich Kalag has elicited a formal protest from the Iranian Government and as from the description given by the Adjutant of the Mekran Levy Corps there can b be no doubt that this place is on the British side of the border,. I am issuing instructions that the Mekran Levy Corps detachment now at Gorich Kalag should remain there pending further instructions. My reason for this is that premature withdrawal might be misrepresented as an admission on our part that we were in the wrong in occupying Gorich Kalag in the first instance.Copy of Confidential memorandum No.63-C. dated the 6th December 1935, from the Assistant Political Agent in Mekran, Panjgur, to the Political Agent, Kulat and Chagai, Camp Sibi. Subject:- Gorich Kalag . Please refer to my telegram No.62 of 2nd instant and your telegram No. 20 CV of the 4th instant. Gorich Kalag is from li to 2 miles on the Kharan (British) side of the demarcated frontier. Though not marked on the map its map reference has been found on the ground (checked by compass bearings) to be sheet 3IM-square A4-99. Patrols from Grawag have visited Gorich Kalag twice monthly since last May. For some reason, a certain amount of doubt appears to prevail in that area as to whether it is really in Iranian or British territory, the inhabitants claiming to be Iranian or British subjects as it suits them During the last few months rumour has been busy among these people, who pass freely forwards and backwards across the border, that the Iranians in pursuance of their active policy of acquiring a firm hold over their jurisdiction in Iranian Baluchistan proposed to establish a post in Gorich Kalag or the neighbourhood. So long as these rumours remained vague and unspecified no more attention was paid to them than to the generality of rumours along the frontier, some of which are worth investigating and some not. Since the 26th of last month, however, specific reports have been received regarding the alleged intention of the Iranians to establish themselves permanently at Gorich Kalag. On the 28th November a secret agent reported that the vakil oX Kuhak had told him 0 X the imminent arrival oi a large party of troops in Kuhak, halX oX whom would remain there and halX push on and establish a permanent post in Gorich Kalag. Orders had beenreceived in Kuhak not to se£t ghee, goats, chickens, etc. to the public hut to reserve them lor the expected new arrivals. On 1st December Kot Havildar Jan Mohomed, who had proceeded with a party of sepoys to Gorich Kalag, reported that he had come to know from local inhabitants that a body of Iranian troops, 50 strong, had left Dizzak and were on the way to Kuhak, where half of them would remain and the other half come on to Gorich Kalag. On the 4th December a selected man, who had been sent across the border to find out what was happening, returned and confirm ed reports previously received from other sources, adding that in view of the arrival of the M.L.C. detachment at Gorich Kalag the Rais of Kuhak had sent off a messenger, Doshmabe by name, to the Iranian, authorities at Dizzak, asking for further instructions &amp;s to the proposed construe' tion of a post for 25 men at Gorich Kalag. It will thus be seen that the reports on this point are unwontedly consistent and circumstantial. I have therefore considered, since it would be difficult to dis lodge the Iranians once they established themselves, that certain precautionary measures are advisable and since December 2nd one platoon from Panjgur (the Grawag garrison being temporarily at reduced strength owing to the annual reliefs of posts being now in progress) has been in camp at Gorich Kalag, carrying on vdth its normal field training and at the same time keeping a watch for intruders. Orders have been given that any armed Iranians found in their area are to be disarmed and escorted back to the border, but all have been strictly warned not to approach, on their own initiative closer than one mile to the frontier. To ensure that no mistakes are made in this respect, the S&amp;rhaddar has accompanied the party to show the line of the demarcated frontier both on the map and on the ground to the troops, as well as to collect any fresh information that may be available. To make doubly certain that no loophole remains for any accidental violation of the frontier on our own part the Adjutant has visited the detachment and taken compass bearings to exactly fix the position of Gorich Kalag in relation to the frontier. n9 n ^? is return Adjutant reports that the Iranians from all the information he couldGrawag, undoubtedly intended in the immediate future to occupy Grorich Kalag, which is in a strategical position commanding the junction of the three passes leading to the North, South and East. This spot is marked on the map as HUR AB (map reference: 31M-B4-29) though no such ^ place appears on the ground. A considerable amount of pack traffic passes along these passes, and a strong post at G-orich Kalag would be in a position to exercise control over these caravan routes and at the same time, from its commanding position on the ground rising to the lest, dominate the watershed slping away on the British side to the North-East, East and South-East, incidentally compromising our own position at Grawag. Apart from its strategical value Gterich Kalag has no claim to any significance. The actual spot of that name consists of only one family, a few occasional graziers and seme two dozen date palms foUy onl^/or five of which are in a condition to bear fruit. Whether or not the Iranians follow up their reported intention of establishing this new post, the physical occupation in force of this part of the country will undoubtedly have a salutary effect in dispelling any doubts that may remain in the minds of the Iranians or the local inhabitants as to in which jurisdiction this area lies. When the Gr&amp;wag garrison is again at full strength and if tlie situation then permits the special precautions now in force might be modified in accordance with circumstances.

Subject:- GQhlQiLKALAG . Please refer to my memorandum Confidential No. 63-C., dated 6th instant. Deshambe, the messenger sent to Dizzax by the Rais Kuhak, returned on the 7th instant with orders fur the Kohdas of Kuhak, Kunerbast and Ispandag to proceed to Dizzak to record their opinion as to on which side of the frontier Gorich Kalag lies. Each Kohda is to bring with him f«nra four of the oldest inhabitants of his locality to assist£ / in the enquiry. This procedure on the part of the Iranian authorities would appear to be superfluous. The frontier has been clearly demarcated, in accordance with the agreement ( ith Persia) of 1896, and can be quite easily seen on the ground in this area as it follows the line of the watershed, leaving Grorich Kalag some 2 miles on the British side. Any responsible officer equipped with a map could provide all the information required by merely going to the vicinity of Boundary Pillar 3. Cn hearing of the sudden appearance of the L.L.G. party at Gorich K? lag the Rais Kuhak, who in the recent past has held somewhat elastic ideas, at our expense, regarding the limits of his jurisdiction, is reported to have hurriedly btjtaKen himself to the fort, whence he and his men have not emerged for several days. Meanwhile the troops from Dizzak expected at Kuhak have not arrived and no movements are taking place on the Dizzak- Kuhak road. A report by one Faqir, an Iranian, to the Adjutant at Grawag that he had been be&amp;tan and expelled with his family from Qizzak from betraying the Iranian plans in regard to Gcrich Kalag and that 200 Iranian troops on 100 camels are on the way to restore the situation is not corroborated by information from other sources and may be dismissed as fiction. He had no marks of any beating and it is suspected that Faqir is himself an Iranian secret agent. Gerich lag is 5-6 hours march from Gra.wag and only about 2 hours from Kuhak. Arrangements have accordingly been made to obtain timely warning of any troop movements on the roads leading to Kuhak, The Iranians may now be reasonably believed to realise that any adventure in the direction of Gorich Kalag will be opposed and it is unlikely that in these circumstances ditey will prusue the plans ascribed to them at least for the present and in their original form. In view of the improved situation and the steps taken to guard against surprise in that area the platoon at Gcrich Kalag has been withdrawn to Grawag, with the exception of a small detachment which will also be withdrawn as soon as possible.- m** ^ v Copy of a telegram No. 1651, dated the 15th December 1935, from the Assistant Political Agent in ^ekran, tamp: Panjgur, to the Political Agent, Kalat and Chagai, Sibi.

Persian protest against the occupation of Goriqb Kalag by British troops and threatening situation near Kuhak. Copy of to POLITICAL COMM' FOR INFORMATION. The actual position of Ooriqb Kalag^/and the earlier stages of the political ddmarchei in Tehran and London are described in the minute at P.Z. 9288/35. As stated there the Persian proposal for a Joint Commission to investigate the incident was turned down by His Majesty’s Government, but the Persian Government have persisted in their desire to send officials to the frontier to verify the accuracy of the maps. All parties on our side are agreed that it is desirable to settle this incident as quietly as possible, and to prevent it acquiring exaggerated importance and harming Anglo-Persian relations. In spite, therefore, of the fact that a fuller account of the incident as supplied in the Government of India’sIndia's telegram .No. 3447 has established that the Persian f)gote»t is entirely unfounded, H.M.G. have decided to agree to the Persian request. However, the despatch of the Persian officials to the frontier has only been agreed to certain conditions; that they should not proceed further than the frontier unless invited to do so by the British official who is to meet them; and even then un-eaoorted/ 3. The concentration of troops at Kuhak has not led to any further unpleasantness. The Persian Government demanded at one stage that before removing their troops,the Government of India must remove theirs, ihis demand was refused, and it appears from the Government of India’s telegram 3454, that the Persian troops have begun to evacuate Kuhak. Only 15 levies are left on our side of the frontier, so there is no reason to expect any further trouble. 4. The Persian Government have certainly acted both stupidly and discourteously in protesting so vehemently without provocation and without verifying their facts. The Government of India suggested that an apology might be demanded (see their telegram *0.3447). Bir H.Knatchbull-Hugessen is opposed to this (see his telegram No.2),but from the language used TvU. h.«* /V ! i) both by Bir Hugbeand by Mr.Rendel at his interview with (W V o fa? fr, |J the Persian Minister^the Persian Government can be under no misapprehensions as to the view which H.M.G. take oir the matter. t ‘Jf kt ' ff- /&lt;jf Jli k\ H 1 l°i , t .j SEEN ^ oIa f IaAa [*o ***Ubtr (POLITICAL.

My telegram No. 396. On December 30th I received reply from Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that in view of information given hy local inhabitants that tax had hitherto been paid to Persian Government and of the possibility of error in maps, Persian Government 'without wishing to doubt my statements or good will of His Majesty's Government' had thought it advisable to send two or three officials to the spot. There would be no necessity for Government of India to send officials 'to form a commission', but it would be sufficient to agree to despatch of Persian officials as proposed. Minister for Foreign Affairs is awaiting results of my enquiries of you as to this. 2. As regards withdrawal of troops, Minister for Foreign Affairs states that he is awaiting my information regarding withdrawal of troops on our side before approaching Ministry of War with a view to withdrawal of 'the remaining forces' which have been sent to that district. 3. I have replied giving him Information contained in Government of India's telegrams Nos. 3447 and 3454 to Secretary of State for India and of Baluchistan telegram Mo. 20 L. to Government of India.

Nevertheless, if the Persian Government still desire to pursue this project, I will inform you 'in order that the authorities on the British side may he aware of the fact'. I am reminding him, however, of our requirement that their officials should not cross the frontier or 'in any way risk further complications'. 4. As to withdrawal of troops, I have reminded His Excellency that in my previous letter I pointed out that Persian forces were despatched under a misapprehension. I have stated that I have now learned that orders have been given for evacuation of all surplus troops from Kuhak (see Government of India’s telegram No. 3454 to Secretary of State for India) and chided that I am confident that if these withdrawals have in fact taken place, the British force will he reduced to normal and that I am enquiring of you what action is being taken.

In that case I would suggest that it would he desirable for Persian officials to he met at the frontier by an official from our side and given any information necessary. This would obviate danger of subsequent accusation that we are concealing something and a-i^o p^c'/ent them wander ing over the frontier line by themselves. 5. If you concur in this I would inform His Excellency that if he sends representatives up to the line they can he met by an officer from our side who will he willing to give them any further information necessary to prove to them accuracy of information and maps.4.

On principle I am definitely against asking Persian Government for apologies. They are not sufficiently grown up for this treatment. we could never get satisfaction. I consider it much better to tell them in suitable terms what we think of their conduct and leave it at that. in the present case I would suggest that when the matter has been finally disposed of I should take suitable opportunity to express regret of His Majesty's Government and Government of India, that before making these unjustifiable charges against us in terms which it is impossible to regard as other than discourteous, they did not first verify their facts or at least consider improbability of such action by a friendly government which had only recently entertained Minister for Foreign Affairs.

He was told that there had seldom been a frontier question with less element of doubt, and the fact that G-orich Kalag was clearly marked on the signed Persian copy of the Commission’s map as being well on Indian side of frontier disposed of any vestige of justification for Persian accusation, which had never been supported by any evidence whatever. In these circumstances, while Persian representatives could go to frontier line from Persian side between pillars 5 and 4, and see for themselves position of G-orich Kalag in Indian territory, it seemed unnecessary to try to arrange for them to cross into Indian territory, minister appeared to accept this statement, and was told that suggestion would not be pursued unless pressed by Persian Government.vsggm f ' m 2 4. Ilinister confessed that proposal for a mixed Commission emanated from himself but he agreed that this proposal could now bo abandoned. 5. As regards troops, your arguments were used. Persians must decide how to dispose of their troops on their ovrn side of the frontier, but in general desire to avoid any kind of incident it would be reasonable and prudent to put and end to abnormal concentration of Persian troops without delay, original reason for their concentration having been based on misunderstanding. 6. minister alluded to statement of village headman, reported in paragraph 2 of your telegram 394-, but was told that question whether taxes had been paid to Persian authorities (which might have been done as the result of misunderstanding on the part of local inhabitants) was irrelevant to question of plain Geographical fact which Persian Government had raised and which had now been disposed of. :; R :I ends.

(h) On 14th December an unconfirmed report was received that a large number of rifles hadjbeen stolen from troops in SARAVAN district and a number of soldiers killed. A later report confirmed that thirty soldiers had been killed by the followers of Nowshervan and that serious trouble was impending. (k) About the middle of December it was stated in Zahidan that British levies of Garavek post east of KUKAK had occupied a position inside Iranian territory. It now appears that Sardar Habibullah Reki (2nd Lieut, in Iranian Army) was sent from Kwash to ascertain the facts. He reported that sane levies were in fact at the place (GORICH KALAG) but he was uncertain whether the spot was in Iranian territory or not. In spite of this report the Iranians at once commandeered lorries (mostly those of Indians working in transit on the Zahidan-Kundi international road) and rushed troops to KUHAK where the strength of the post was raised to 380 and some guns. It has since transpired that after the * W -A. events outlined in para.(h) the authorities were exceedingly nervous and that the appearance of a few Chagai levies on a hill near Frontier Boundary Post 3 (about 5i miles from KUHAK) gave rise to the inaccurate report that our levies had crossed the frontier. Doubtless the Iranians suspected some sinister motive andjlmagined they were in some way supporting Nowshervan, Troops were rushed to KUHAK partly on the strength of the false report and partly owing to the prevailing nervousness resulting from the loss of thirty soldiers in the neighbour hood.Yt^ e*&gt; FILE 1 1 PCN/tUA. 1936 (149 groups!

Place is situated in Kharan territory, and there is only one revenue paying inhabitant. It is correct that he has been paying revenue to Persian officials at Kuhak owing to its proximity, and no doubt to keep on good terms with Persians, who are his nearest neighbours.

As regards specific questions raised in Tehran telegram 394, we are making further enquiries from Baluchistan but it seems that if Hur-TId-Din is to be believed taxes have, in the past, been paid to Iranian Government and not to British Government. We would, however, submit that this fact, if true, does not affect our title to sovereignty over Gorich Kelag in view of its geographical position on our side of the demarcated frontier. Place is considerably nearer to Kuhak than to Grawag which is our nearest levy post and for this reason, family residing at Gorich Kalag has been liable to Iranian pressure and have been claiming to be British or Iranian subjects as it suits them, information as to earthworks or fortifications will follow when received from Baluchistan, but we are unable to see how question is relevant to present dispute since, if they have been (Tmade), they are purely defensive works against possible Iranian agression on our side frontier and constitute no danger or threat to them unless they commence such aggression. 4. Our general comments are:- (a), we could certainly not agree to a mixed commission to investigate Iranian claim to a place which has been proved beyond all possiblepossible doubt to be well inside our frontiers; (b), we object strongly to accuracy of our maps being questioned when authenticity of maps signed by Iranian representatires and recorded in Iranian archiTes ( Tile Tehran telegram 385o December 33rd,) full (sic,?fully) corroborates our claim to Gorich Kalag 0 (c) We consider that the Iranian Government owe an apology to the Government of India for the offensive nature of their original protest ( vide Tehran telegram 371, December 12th) 0U INDEXED* ^Jii a«y further commumcation on this subject, please A^uote Nog 75^/7-237/3^ and address —not to any person by name, but to —' / “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London THE Under-Secretary of Statd for Affairs presents his cc^npliments to ^ 7y^ $ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop&lt;^' of the under-mentioned paper.^ t INJJIA DIHECT Foreign Office, $0 L Reference to previous correspondence : Description of Enclosure. ^ 7v^3^7P- Z&lt;ffz* %/ Name and Date.

(1) That Persie/n Government should send repre sents tives including member of Ministry of Foreign i-nTfsirs to Gorich Kslag to verify accuracy of maps. (2) That force now at Gorich Kalag should be reduced or withdrawn. 2. as to (1) I pointed out that implication that explanations given as reported in my telegram No.223 to India 1 ., and your telegram No. 231 to me were unreliable and said that in my opinion the Government of India would be justly annoyed by such a request. I went over information in Government of India’s telegram No.33. I:o. 3346 to the Secretary of State of India again with the map and finally he admitted that there could be no question of accuracy of our statements which his Government had no desire to question. Nevertheless the head lan of the village had informed the Persian authorities previously that taxes had been paid to Persia. They were anxious to enquire further into this and also to verify accuracy of maps marked Gorich Kalag as on the Persian side. 33. After lengthy conversation I Sc.id that I v^ould telegraph to enquire whether you or G-overnment of India could provide any further information on either point and that if the Persian Government then still pressed their suggestion to send representatives I would pass it on, 4. As to (2) I said that their suggestion was quite unjustifiable. The presence of increased force at Gorich Kalag was due to their own accusation and increase in Persian force at Kuhak. Their accusation had been shown to be false, therefore their troo os wer e unnecessary. No doubt as soon as their force was with drawn ours would be reduced to normal. 5. I subsequently saw Schelly who informed me with reference to my telegram No.391 that Minister for Foreign Affairs had been mistaken. Suggestion of mixed commission had been made in London and the Persian Minister had telegraphed that you had agreed to it or were willing to consider it. I used the sarnie arguments to Soheily and the matter was finally left that I would inform you of Persian proposal. 6. As regards (2) Soheily entirely agreed that it was for the Persian Government to withdraw their force first. Both he and Mot&amp;medy informed me categorically that stringent orders had been sent to avoid any clash. 7. They both mentioned that ”fortifications” had been dug round Gorich Kalag and expressed anxiety on this score. I took the line that anything we did was purely for internal reasons and that they need not worryworry. I should he grateful if you could give me any further information which I can pass on about this also on statement in paragraph 5 above.

Instructions have therefore been sent to competent authori ties to abstain from talcing any action in that place until the said representatives arrive and result of their views is made known'. Note also states that reason for sending Persian forces is due to despatch of British Indian troops to Gorich Kalag 'without warning' and that His Excellency is awaiting withdrawal of British force before withdrawing Persian troops. 2. I have replied pointing out that His Excellency's impression that either ’-is Majesty's Government or I agreed to Mixed Commission is false as shown by my telegram No. 391 and your telegram No. 237. I have sent him substance of your telegram (second and third paragraphs) almost textual- ly and for greater clearness have repeated your views as given in third paragraph. 3. as regards withdrawal of troops I have pointed out that Persian troops were sent in consequence of false impression • • •impression of violation of Persian territory which has since been indisputably disproved and that further retention of these troops will cause the v/orst possible impression. 4.

There is some local tension on the frontier regarding a place called Goriqb Kalag. During the last six months a great number of British patrols have visited this place, and, hearing that the Persians intended to occupy it, the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, who, according to the latest Indian Political Department list, is a Captain Baig, a junior member of the Department, sent a small detachment of Mekran Levy Corps to occupy it tov/ards the end of November. 1. There is no doubt that Goriqb Kalag is on our side of the frontier which wars defined j in an Agreement^with the Persian Government regarding this portion of the frontier in 1896 anc 3330 1000 12.34and is demarcated with, pillars. A map of the district on a scale of 1 inch = 4 miles is attached; Goriqb Kalag being shown by a pencil cross in the right hand top corner of Square A.4. A detailed description of the location of the place is contained in the Government of India’s telegram, No. 5346 (P.Z.9073). A copy of the relevant portion of the 1896 Agreement has also been put on the file. 3. The Persians delivered protests at Tehran, London, Delhi and at Meshed against the encroach ment of British armed Forces into -Wse Persian territory. The reply given to the Persian Minister in London on £Oth December is at P.Z. 9248/35. Meanwhile the Persianshave reinforced their post at Kuhak, a few miles on their side of the frontier, to about 300 with machine guns and mountain guns. Arrangements have been made to strengthen the British detach ment to 150 if required . The Assistant Political Agent has been instructed to take all possible precautions to avoid any incident on the frontier, and not to patrol the border nearer than Goriqb itself. In the unlikely event of a Persian attack, he has been told that if it is made in strength he should retire v/ithout hesitation. These instructions seem suitable. iv. Y/e have asked the Foreign Office to telegraph instructions to Mr. Knatchbull-Hugesson to explain to the Persian Government the position of Goriqb Kalag in relation to the frontier, and to urge the Persian Government to issue stringent orders to their Local AuthoritiesMinute Paper. Department. 3. that they should take steps to prevent an incident or a violation of the Indian frontier occurring. s. A subsidiary point is that a number of Indian lorries have been impressed by the Persian military at Zahidan to carry the reinforcements sent to Kuhak and some Indian lorry drivers have been maltreated. The question of Indian lorry drivers in Persia is an old one which was discussed at Delhi during M. Kazemi's recent visit here, and Mr. Knatchbull-Hugbsson has made suitable representations at Tehran. All the commandeered lorries have now returned to Zahidan, and if the Government of India wish anything further to be done they will no doubt make proposals. * 2-1 * c/z , i /W ^ ^ u C^ 2 - f'yjr) A ^ 7°. h' ^ ** ft' ^ LyA'tf t A«^Cv CcWww^ ^&gt;V tL l k ^ t ^ ^ K *iS. ftn fc+Jt-lgy, / 1 , Tr f (ak jwjfct*. tltxyyaAAn i/uAaT o) fUtVU tkcJr ^ t ^ cu 7 * /m 'Cj {(fi.

Persian Minister has been telegraphically instructed oy Minister for Foreign Affairs to propose joint commission to 'proceed to spot' 1 and to ^ascertain definitely place where British troops have arrived and determine ownership of district 1 ’. Persian delegates are stated to have been already appointed and to be ’’leaving for this destination”. 2. He has been told orally that there seems no case for a commission. Position is' not in doubt; frontier is clearly defined by formal agreement and is quite unmistakable, and situation of Gorich Kalag on British side of frontier, which is in any case obvious from map and from course of streams near it, has been most carefully verified by British authorities. In absence of any prima facie case to show that position or frontier are in serious doubt commission would be quite uncalled for and Government of India could not possibly be expected to accept it. 3. In reply to further questions Minister has been informed that there is no reason why local 1 ersian authorities shoula not go up to clearly established frontier line as defined in #oldich agreement and recognisable on ground in light of maps, thus seeing for themselves that post is not in Persian territory. But they must on no account cross frontier or risk incident, and it is to be honedhoped that strict instructions will be sent to this effect to Officer Comancling Persian troops wnose recent concentration at Kuhaw has already caused justifiable uneasiness.

He was also shown the relevant parts of the text of the Holdich Agreement of 1896 and told that although Aitchison’s Treaties were published in India he could doubtless purchase in London the volume of these treaties (i.e. Volume XI 1933 edition) in which it appears* 4 * Mr. Rendel emphasised the fact that the important point was that the Gorich Kalag, which the British levies had been regularly patrolling for some time past and had now occupied, was at least a mile on the British side of the frontier, which lay in that section along a clearly defined watershed and that its position had been recently carefully verified* in answer to an enquiry by M. Ala he said that he had not heard that Persian troops had ever visited this place, but the movements/movementst or rumours of movements, on the Persian side of the frontier had clearly made it necessary to reassure the inhabitants by sending levies to occupy it. 5. M. Ala appeared to be well satisfied with the explanation ^ and took full notes of the various points. 6. Mr. Rendel took advantage of a chance remark by M. Ala about Persian troop movements to observe that he had heard that the most recent movements had led to the impressment of a number of Indian lorry drivers into the service of the military authorities for the transport of these troops and that in many cases the drivers had received ill-treatment. He did not however wish to take this question up with M. Ala as there had been previous instances of such ill-treatment and the whole question had for some time oeen the subject of discussion between Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen and M. Kaxemi. Mi*. Knatchbull-hugebsen would also be dealing with the most receit cases, and if the assistance of M. Ala were now to be invoked this would mean that the question was being discussed through two channels: it was naturally desirable to avoid such duplication whenever possible. M. Ala heartily agreed, but it is doubtful if he saw that this remark had aV. £.9186/35. TKIT-iHAU., S.-'.l. ?Srd December 1935.

This concentration of troops, caused apparently by excitement amongst local military authorities, may lead to most regrettable incidents unless stringent orders are sent immediately from Tehran that no action should be taken while matter is being dealt with through diplomatic discussion. We should be grateful if Minister could be instructed to make representations on these lines.COPY. (E 7420/7239/34). ^ NO DISTRIBUTION. Code telegram to Mr. Knatchbull Hugessen (Tehran).

For the last six months very great number of patrols have visited this place twice a month. 2* Gorich Kalag consists of small date grove and two walled gardens with permanent population of one family* Adjutant has personally visited place and located exact position by compass bearings* It lies north-east of subsidiary watershed running from boundary pillar 3 to point where it joins the Si ah an Koh range; reference, Holdich agreement* See degree sheet, 31^M, square {Y Gorich Kalag lies at intersection of line drawn due south from Ragan Pass and almost due east of trigonometrical point 70 4! .•ar ; w c ThisThis hae been checked by (? further) bearings on boundary pillar 3 and on Tumpi Kalat, 3&lt;, The watershed described in the Holdich agreement is unmistakable and Gorich Kalag is more than one mile on the British side of the border from the nearest point of the watershed Occupation of this point gives strategic control of Gorich River valley and presumably this is the object of Persians intended occupation and subsequent complaint. It is interesting to note that place named means neck of Gorich river and therefore must be on the British side of the watershed.~ cwp/fcn/to HBHHi r t SECRET 6533 0 DECYPHEH OP TELEGRAMo Prom Government of India^ Foreign and (COPIES Political Department, to Secretary CIRCULATED) of State for India 0 Dated Rew Delhi * 17th December, 1935 0 Received llo45 aoCio, 17th December, 1935 0 XXX IMMEDIATE o 3346 0 SECORD PARTo 3 0 We presume that ordnance map referred to and also correspondence of 1896 between Colonel Holdich and the Government of India regarding the Boundary Delimitation Convention and subsequent Demarcation Agreement are on record at the India Office and Tehran (see particularly Holdich letters to Foreign 34 and 35 (?5th April,) (?1896) 0 These have been examined here and appear to afford indisputable evidence that (?Gorich) Kalag is over a mile to the British side of the frontier then agreed to by the Persian Government and demarcated by Joint Commission on the ground.

This action, which was taker; without permission and was contrary to standing orders, is regretted. The party, who were armed with rifles but had no machine gun, are reported to have been detained by the Persian Commandant at Lizzak. 3. In this connection I would venture to point out to Your Highness that Persian military patrols have crossed the Makran border on several /occasions His Highness Mirza Mohamed All Khan Poroughi, Minister for foreign Affairs, Tehran.occasions and have not been detained. A case in point is the incident which took place at liiazari Koh, in British territory, at the beginning of June last, when a British patrol frooi Sun tsar encountered a x-&gt; &amp; rty of Persian sepoys. The latter were not detained and the rntter was satisfactorily settled between the British and Persian Local authorities, although during an interview which took place on March 28th last on the frontier opposite to Mand Port the Acting Political Agent at Mand was assured by the Military Governor of Persian Baluchistan that violations of the frontier had been due to ignorance and would not occur again. 4. I beg, therefore, that Your Highness will be so good as to cause immediate telegraphic instructions to be issued to the Corunandant at Dizzak with a view to his releasing tiie Indian officer and men in question in order that they may return forthwith to British territory.

Correspondence is chiefly exchanged between the British Legation in Tehran, the Foreign Office in London, and the External Affairs Department of the Government of India. The correspondence includes efforts to ascertain the facts and circumstances of reported incidents, and the ensuing diplomatic correspondence with the Persian Government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Incidents covered include: in September 1930, the arrival in Dizzak [Dīzūk], Persian Baluchistan, of British levies in pursuit of camel thieves; in November 1935, the presence of British troops near Kuhak [Nūk Jow], Persia, the Persian Government’s dispatch of 400 troops to the region, the British Government’s insistence that the area occupied by its troops at Gorich Kalag [Gorich Categ] lay in British territory, and assertions that troops were dispatched in response to reports that a Persian occupation of the area was anticipated; in November 1937, the raid of a shop in Pilani Sunt (referred to locally as Kastag [Kastak]) by Iranian customs officials, regarded by British officials as an incursion into British territory.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Territorial rights</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000038#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
