The face is triangular, with modeled brows.  The eyes are set into shallow, narrow sockets.  The lids of the eyes are indicated by two modeled ridges.  \r\n\r\nSculpture patrons of the Middle Kingdom favored the use of hard, dark stones and compact, block-like forms to insure the long-term survival of their statues.  The texts on the front of the kilt and on the sides of the seat request offerings and record Neferhotep's name and titles, as well as his parentage.  The deity invoked to secure the offerings is the deceased king who founded the Middle Kingdom, Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II (11th Dynasty).", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1912", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/27934", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Giovanni Dattari, Cairo, [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Dattari Collection Sale, HÃ´tel Drouot, Paris, 1912, no. 294, pl.
