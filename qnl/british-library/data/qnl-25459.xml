This text would perhaps also suffice to give by implication^© Deputy ^ 6 omionioner Captain Wilson ovor the two tech^nical officers of the Bri-.ish Mission who as above stated aro of oho superior. - rank of Lt Colonel and Major butl agree with Mr Wratislaw that it would be prof- L erable to remove all possible ambiguity on tho point. botv/oon nmbera of the 4 missions fulfilling similar funct I 10 Right Honourable, Sir M.Grey.Bart.K.G. M.F. etc etc,. etcI understand t3iat the Indiim Government have already agreed that m the event of tiie Deputy Cocruiaeioner having to take the place of the Cominaioner.the foruer shall ipso facto become head of the Mission and therefore of course take procedenc of the technical officers of whatever standing, but it appears to iae tbit it is essential that the Deputy OoroLiissioner shall on all occasions take rank no:ct to the Consaissionor. I do not see for instance how unless the teclm- icol iacmbi^ro are subordinated to trie political members of the Mission,the Deputy Corxiissioner could be detached fox* work on a sub-Couti a si on on which eitlior of the senior nenibers of who British technical staff is oirrployod. It ?/ould I conceive be impossible to give Captain Wilson any temporary Military rank superior to that of Lt Colonel,but it occurs to me that by conferring on him for * term of the frontier Commission the personal rank of Consul,who according to the retaliation of page 150 of the foreMvi Office List ranks with but after a Colonel,and therefore presumably abote a Ltr Colonel,the difficulty would bo solved in a maimer calculated to avoid arousing any susceptibilities. Mr Mi nor sky has informed Hr W rat is law that the Hus si an Deputy Commission will ranic above the Russian teclinical officers,the fonaor having the rank of Vice-Consul and the two latter that of Captain. In the case of the Britih Commissioner the higher grade of Consul would have to be given to the Deputy Commissioners in order to attain the desired result, but ni&gt; international difficulty will thereby result as the Deputy Commissioners areplaced on a footing of equality by Article 1 of the Reglement.

Sir F. Grey understands that the pay he would he receiving. If not serving on the frontier Connlssion would, together with allowances, aaount to approximate ly Seven hundred pounds per annum; he has, however, owing to his special and indeed unique qualifications, been detached from more congenial duties in Arabistan for this work on the Turco-Perslan frontier. He will frequently have to act practically as principal Coaiaissioner in one region while Mr. Wratlslaw is occupied In another; his work will be as arduous, awl at times as responsible, as that of Mr. Wratislaw, whor moreover, he is to replace in the event of absence through traporary illness,- a contingency which is un fortunately not unlikely to arise amidst the hardships of the peculiar work to be accomplished, and in the unhealthy regions to be traversed.

V In reply I am to say tiiat iJy Londs are oy no means convinced of the necessity for the payment to Captain Wilson of salary at so high a rate as £ 1,000 per annum.

Dear Sir Louis Mallet:- I have seen the recent telegrans from Constantinople and notice that Minorsky insists that secretaries should be attached both to the Russian and British Delegations, and that Wilson is reported to have concurred. I discussed the question of a secretary with Wilson before he left, and we both came to the con clusion that it was better not to have a secretary from the service as a native Indian with knowledge of Persian would be able to do all the general typing and accounts, while Wilson himself volunteered to do the cyphering and any confidential typing. We considered it important not to increase expense unnecessarily or to swell our numbers unduly. attendants, camp outfit, etc., than a native, and I do not think that he would have sufficient work to justify A diplomatic secretary would entail more his presence. TheThe Protocols, which will presumably be in French, can easily he drawn up under the supervision of the four Commissioners. If Minorsky considers that he cannot get on without a secretary by all means let him take one on the Pus si an delegation; hut I consider that Wilson should he able to do all that is required on the British side. I have little doubt that Minorsky who is a very masterful person, has had a good deal to do with Wilson's volte face. I also notice that the date of the meeting of the Commission has been put off until December 15th at Mohammerah. In these circumstances it might be better for me to start for Crete as arranged on September 17th to settle up my affairs there, and then return to London to study the voluminous correspondence during October, and at the end of that month to discuss the whole question with Parker in the light of my acquired knowledge. This would certainly facilitate my subsequent work.If you approve of this arrangement, which would enable me to reach Moharnmerah early in December, might I ask that an official letter should be written to me accordingly? Yours etc., (Signed) A. C. Wratislaw.I ■ CONFIDENTIAL I CALLED on Colonel Hedley to-day at the War Office, accompanied by Captain Wilson, to talk over the question of the surveying party to be attached to the British delegation on the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission. Colonel Hedley was unaware, until informed by Captain Wilson, of the existence at the Foreign Office of the record of triangulation done by Colonel Williams’ commission, which will be available for the forthcoming commission. He expressed agreement with our view that two officers of the Survey of India, with the appropriate native staff, would be sufficient in order to check and bring the identic map up to date and to effect detailed surveys of the more important districts on the frontier, and he said that his opinion always had been that in any case the Survey of India and not the War Office should supply the surveying staff. He added that one officer, working by himself, would be comparatively helpless, with which opinion we agree. A. C. WRATISLAW. London, August 6, 1913.

I am anxious to secure arrival of all missions at Mohammerah by 31st October if possible, as there will be, according to Captain Wilson, considerable preliminary work to be done there, and it is doubtful if commissions could even then start work from Diaiji northwards much before 1st January, which they should if southern part of frontier is to he completed before hot weather. In view of Sir W. Townley’s telegram, would it be possible to telegraph to him sufficient detail for preliminary identic communication from British and Russian Legations to Persian Government ? Great pressure should be exercised, if necessary, at Tehran to secure early and favourable reply, and arrival of Persian commissioners at Mohammerah by 31st October, but even if they cannot arrive till a few days later British and Russian missions will have plenty of preliminary work to occupy them there. It would also be well for you and your Russian colleague to tell the Persian members of the commission at Constantinople of the solution arrived at, and induce them to recommend its acceptance at once at Tehran.

He would be glad to know if the Secretary of State for India confixms Captain Wilson's view that the officer who is to replace him cannot proceed to his post at Dizful in time to accompany the survey party, and, if so, should take over from Captain Wilson at Mohammerah on October 15th.

Numerous details as to the staff of the British delegation on the Turco Persian frontier Commission cannot be finally settled until we are aware of the composition of the Russian technical staff, and will involve further communication with the Government of India.

It is understood tijat what -is known as tne n Identic Map* ! , widen lias been the basis of negotiations in the rast, is intended to be the map on which the boundary as finally settled shall be laid down. I am to point out that this, map, besides being very old and out of date, was not originally prepared on any scientific method ox survey. It was not based on a system of triangulation, without which | accuracy is impossible, and all the reoorts which have been received from travellers from time to time have thrown grave ■ doubts •o i i I j ^0 Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.4. Wv ..O', ■ US' doubts on its accuracy. In the opinion of the Amy Council iu will be inipossicle to show the new boundary and boundary pillars on this map* o. It would appear to be a mistake to leave any loophole for future dissension owing to the lack of an accurate mar. If tlio map cannot be trusted, it will be necessary to say whether the pillars on the ,round or the man are to be taken as deciding the boundary in any future disputes which nay arise. It is usual to name the roan as l V -i. the decisive authority, for pillars can be moved, but to do this an accurate map is essential. It will, in any case, be necessary to take a survey party to survey new detail, to prepare new maps on larger scales of important areas. and to correct the old map as far as possible, and * the Army Council desire to express the opinion that this party should he of sufficient atrengfcu to carry out a trianpulation throughout the whole length of t.ne bouudary, and to prepare an accurate rae-p based on this triangulation. The scale of this ’.rap should be 1:250,000, but special maps on larger scales would no doubt be required of certain 31 &gt;0 ri areas.4. If the survey party were found at home tho Arriy Council would recmuond a strength of three officers and four topographers. It would, however, he far better that the work should he carried out by the Survey of India, who are more accustomed to tbe conditions which prevail in this 'fl area and whose surveyors would be able to talk Persian. The Survey of India would also be able to provide the •o necessary instruments, camp equipment, etc., and would generally complete the work more economically than v/ould v be possible from England. If tho work is done y tlie Survey of India it will be for them to decide on the strength necessary to do the work without unduly delaying the Commission. The field season for survey parties in India commences in October. Now tli&amp;t there is to do only one comii- ■ &gt; v- ion it will almost certainly commence from the southern end. It is desirable that the survey work should be started as soon as possible, and if nossible in advance of the cororaiasion, and it would be convenient from every point of view for the survey oarty to start work at uonauiereh in October, which is the best time of the year for working inin place. IT tliis 1 b to be done it .;ill be neeebaary lor tliO Survey ol India bo be infor.aed ue early as possible. 6. I uil to add that f quite apart from the work of the commission, it would bo unfortunate if such a unique opportunity of acquiring accurate goograpl leal information about a little imovm area should be lost.

Cir:- I have the honour to submit below, as instructed, my preliminary recommendations regarding the British Technical, Military, Medical and Clerical Staff whom the Government of India may be asked to depute. 2. These recommendations are necessarily tentative as the composition and numbers of the British delegation will to some extent depend on the composition of the Russian delega tion, and until the question has been fully discussed between Captain Wilson and the Russian Authorities it is not possible to put forward final suggestions I would ask, however, that these proposals may receive preliminary examination and that, if they are approved in principle, Captain Wilson may be informed accordingly and instructed to make them the basis oi his discussion with the Russians. 3.,A •0|| .4, G-overn- '• 1 have alread y suggested that in order to a.void de le../ Captain Wilson may be authorised to address the ment oi India direct (from Constantinople or bt.Petersburg or wherever he may be) with proposals for giving effect to the arrangements suggested below in so far as they may have been approved, end subject to such modifications as may have been lound necessary after discussion with the Russian Authorities. iLc uoveminent oi India might perhaos be informed m ad vance of the general nature of the staff as approved by the Foreign Office which they are to be invited to depute to the Commission, and might be requested to take the necessary action on receipt iroin Captain Wilson of detailed proposals. Technical Staff . Having regard to the existence of the Identic hap pre pared by Colonel Williams' Commission, and in view of the de tailed topographical work which has subsequently been done from the neighbourhood of Fao to beyond Hawizeh, it would ap pear unnecessary to carry out a detailed triangulation alon- this portion of the frontier, particularly as the original■ ) mapS 8Jld tr ^ en S u lation records of the first Commission ere svailatile at the Foreign Office and will, I understand, be loanee ior the use of the uurvey partv. Only a small portion of the Pusht i Kuh frontier ap pears likely to cause any serious difficulty south of Zohab. nil that seems necessary is to have a sufficient topo graphical staff to check and bring up to date the Identic nap, and locate the boundary pillars thereon, and to make e larger scale (1 m - 1') survey of such localities (e.g. Said Kessan lands of Pusht i Kuh) as are likely to give rise to acute difficulty in future, or where, as in the case of the Zohab district, important British interests are involved. S. I am therefore of opinion that two British survey of ficers Of me burvey oi India with lour fully trained and competent Indian surveyors (not sub-surveyors) should suf fice. It may be possible lor Captain Wilson to arrange with the Kussians that the bulk of topographical work North of latitude 36° (or thereabouts) should be undertaken by them,a similarsimilar obligation being 'undertaken by the British party south of that line. In this case one British survey of ficer might be spared from the Commission after Zohab has oeen passed end could devote himself to the preparation of the finished maps of the southern part of the frontier for signature by the Commissioners# 1 snould mention tnat I to-day discussed the above pro- pOoals ior technical staff with Colonel Hedley at the War Office and found him to agree with them. military Staff . /— In the Russian Government’s Aide-Memoire of July 13/26 1913, forwarded in Sir G. Buchanan’s Despatch No. 231 of July 26th, it is stated that ’’ll va de soi que des Qfficiers de 1’btat Major General et du corps Topographique devront etre adjoints b. la Commission pour s’occuper de tracer en realite la ligne frontiers'. I presume that the ’’Officers of the General Staff” in question will simply be surveying Officers and that it is unnecessary to attach to our Commission other Officers than the two mentioned under the heading 'Technical 1 Staff”.Staff”. Should this view prove mistaken, measures might perhaps oe taKen subsequently, if considered advisable, to appoint similar British functionaries. It seems necessary, however, from all points of view to nctve an adequate British escort, under a specially selected British Officer, who could do some general staff work in addition to his other duties. I would suggest therefore an escort of Thirty Indian Cavalry under a British Officer. It would, of course, be convenient and economical if Captain Wilson could come to an understanding with the Rus sians whereby the latter would provide the bulk of escort in the North and have only a small force, say of ten men, along the southern section of the frontier, the British force being similarly reduced in the North. Apart from the question of expense, it is inconvenient and on the whole undesirable to take a large Indian escort on to the Northern part of the frontier, and I therefore trust that some such arrangement may be found feasible and may be approved. In view of the state of insecurity on the frontier, I do not see how it is possible to dispense with an escort. Medical Staff.Medical Staff. Ihe size of the British Commission and the character oi one country to be traversed make adequate provision for xiiedical attendance very necessary, and under ordinary circumstances and in view of the fact that in addition to Captain Wilson and nyself there will be at least three Brioisn Omicers deputed by the Government of India, I should not have hesitated to ask for a British Officer of the Indian i^edicai Service. In the interests of economy, however, and as I understand that the Government of Indi might find it difficult to spare the services of such an oliicer, I would ask for an Indian Sub-Assistant Surgeon of some seniority with previous service in the Gulf or in Persia if possible, and a selected compounder to assist him. It is essential that this Medical Officer should be a competent man in whom the British members of the Mission can have confidence. But I would ask that the British Resident in the Persian Gulf may be invited to authorise the Consular Surgeon at Mohammerah to accompany the Commission for some a portionV fll tiie Resideno s opinion ne can oe spared temporarily from Moioammeraii. I trust that, should I find the presence of a British Medical Officer essential owing to the state of health of the party or of any member thereof, favourable considera tion may be accorded to any proposals I may subsequently have to submit in this matter. Clerical Staff. This item is not dependent on the result of Captain Wilson's discussions with the Russian Authorities, and if the provision suggested below is approved, I would beg that Captain Wilson may be authorised forthwith to adaress the Indian Authorities on the subject forthwith The British Commission will require one fully trained Indian Clerk competent to keep accounts and records and to type letters, copies of protocols, etc. For vernacular work a Persian Mirza with some knowledge of Arabic will beinto Persian. as iMortn oi Zoiiab it will be necessary to add a Mirza •yiwii a similar knowledge of Azerbaijan Turkish to act interpreter to the party, none of which excepting myself will nave any knowledge of this dialect which is current along tne Northern frontier. He could be procured through His Majesty’s Consulate at Tabriz. Should the Turkish Commissioners or most of them nrove ■“-i ignorant of French, it may be advisable to attach to the Commission some person knowing Osmanli Turkish well. But xor the moment it seems unnecessary to do more than menti on a need which may not eventuate. r I have, &amp;c ., (Signed) A. C. bratislaw, f CONFIDENTIAL. 4 %J i o o Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.
