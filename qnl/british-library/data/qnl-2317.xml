Political Agency, Bahrain, the 12th February 1941, BUS^nE RESr iNCY. MO . Ozio To CJ^FIOENTIAL RECaRDS The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E. (?) Memorandum With reference to the recent troubles at Diba it is understood from the Political Officer Trucial Coast that the Sultan of Muscat wrote to Shaikh Khalid, Regent of Kalba, asking that the small tower^ «rected by the people of Diba against the Shahuh^ should now be removed. The Political Officer Trucial Coast now reports that he has seen Shaikhs Khalid and Humaid and that they have signified their willing ness to leave the tower, which is incomplete, in its present state provided that the Sultan of Muscat gives suitable guaranties that he will control the Shahuhj^ to the extent that he will pay compensation for any damage or injury they may cause to the property or people of Diba. The Political Officer Trucial Coast considers this to be eminently reason able. Shaikh Khalid stated that he hoped that any such agreement might be made under British auspices, to the extent that we would use our good offices to ensure its enforcement. 2. The building of fortified towers is a very provocative step and is, I think, to be discouraged whenever possible, but in this case Shaikh Khalid has stated that the Shahuh#, who number some 10,000, had been very troublesome and had committed agression without notice and were still committing thefts in his territory. If, therefore, it is possible to obtain the Sultan of Muscat's agreement to the guarantees asked /-asked for without the condition of complete removal of the tower, the affair will be settled and if the Shahuh^ should cause no further trouble during the next year the Shaikh of Kalba could be asked to remove the tower completely. iMfum -cu- Political Agent, Bahraih, [^ ft * M /&gt;**. jo.

Hickinbotham, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, 1 I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 834, dated the 18th April, 1941, and to inform you that I visited Dibah on the 17th of April accompanied by the Wali of Sohar who had been instruct ed by the Muscat Government to proceed there and to furnish a report on the situation. At Dibah I met the Sheikh of Fujairah and Ali bin Mudhaffar, Wali of Shinas, who had already been sent by the Muscat Government with instructions to endeavour to terminate the present hostilities which instructions, I am glad to report, he had been able to carry out before I arrived with the aid of the Sheikh of Fujairah. I visited the Jawasim section of the area and conversed with Barut, the Wali, afterwards inspecting the unfinished tower which has been the cause of much of the trouble. Later I went on to the Shihuh area and talked with the Shihuh Sheikh, Hassan bin Rahmah ; and various tribal leaders from the hills of the Masandam Peninsula. As I was returning from Dibah to Khor Fakkan I met Khan Sahib Abdur Razzak, Residency Agent at Sharjah, and had a full discussion with him. Late the same evening after we had returned to Kalba we had a lengthy interview with Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kalba, and his nephew Sheikh Humaid bin Abdullah. 2. • There have been changes in the political situation in the area affected by the recent incidents since the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf was produced by Lorimer in 1908. Mad-hah t^Lorimer ,, Volume II /Volume II page 1696) is much the same and is visible from Khor Fakkan but appears to be only about four miles away. Ghunah ('Lorimigr 11 Volume II page 1696) has altered little as far as I know and the same applies to A1 Hair ('Lorimer' 1 Volume II page 1696), but in Dibah there have been important changes. The original village of Dibah now belongs exclusively to the Sharqiyin and it is the vill age of Ba^ah with which this despatch deals. The Jawasim have been ousted from Dibah and now inhabit the southern section of Bai'ah from the dividing Wadi mentioned by 'Lorimer' at page 463 of Volume II for a distance of some six hundred yards to the north. Using the term Dibah to indicate the whole area as is generally done nowadays it will be noted that the Sharqiyin own the lower half while the Jawasim and the Shihuh are uneasy neighbours in the upper half of which the Shihuh have the larger share. The area is no longer in the Has-al-Khaimah district of Sharjah. 3. The immediate cause of the trouble between the Jawasim and the Shihuh is the Regent of Kalba^ endeavour to manage his own affairs in Dibah and to protect his subjects from acts of brigand age. The Shihuh are of a peculiar and aggressive disposition and until recently did practically anything that they wished in the Jawasim area even, I understandj to the extent of liberating i persons from the Fort and nothing was done to check their highhand ed behaviour by the Jawasim Wali nor I regret to say by the Wali of Khassab in whose Wilayat the majority of them live. As soon as the Regent of Kalba took action to end this state of affairs there were immediate and explosive reactions from the Shihuh. The position between the two tribes is not eased by the fact that their common frontier is, like so many frontiers in Arabia, ill defined. Between what is without doubt Jawasim territory and what is equally certainly Shihuh there is an area covered with date gardens some six hundred yards in length parallel to the beach, which is inhab ited by a small tribe known as the Dhuriyin who live with the Shihuh but pay half their Zakat to the Jawasim and half to the Shihuh /Shihuli. Neither side can lodge any certain claim to the area, so it remains a '^o man's land' 1 • The first encounter occurred in November and came to an end when the Sheikh of Fujairah and the Walis of Khassab and Sohar inter vened and succeeded in terminating the actual hostilities. The Jawa- sim then commenced to build a tower on the beach some n ^ yards on the Shihuh side of the Jawasim fort and at the edge of what they can undoubtedly claim as their own territory, whereupon the Shihuh object ed and petitioned the Muscat Government to press for its removal or permit them to construct an opposition tower. The Sultan refused to permit them to build and negotiations were entered upon with the obj- &gt; ect of persuading the Jawasim to remove their tower in return for a guarantee by the Sultan that he would control his subjects and accept responsibility for their acts and pending a decision the Regent of Kalba agreed to discontinue work on the building but he placed a small garrison in it. On the 28th March the Shihuh attacked c-he \ garrison and shots were exchanged but the action was inconclusive. The Jawasim exasperated by the action of their neighbours seem to have decided to accept an invitation to resume control of the villages of Mad-hah, Ghunah ; and Al Hair,whose inhabitants akin to the Beni Saad sub-section of the Shihuh living between Shinas and Sohar have been paying Zakat to the Shihuh for a number of years although I understand they originally paid Zakat to the Jawasim and were indeed according to Lorimer (Volume II page 1694) in 1908 part of the then disinteg rating Jawasim Sheikhdom of Sharjah. I am told that the invitation to the Jawasim was made owing to the inhabitants' mistrust of the Shihuh and the uncertainty of the situation. The Jawasim were not opposed in their undertaking although shots continued to be exchanged between the two tribes in Dibah. 4. On the Shihuh side the question of the tower looms very large indeed and was the immediate cause of the outbreak last month although their resentment at the Regent of Kalba's wish to be master in his own house is the real reason for the whole disturbance. The Shihuh knew that /knew that the work of construction of the t6»er had ceased pending the result of the negotiations in progress and they considered that the Jawasim were not carrying out the spirit of the arrangement by placing a garrison on the foundations of the tower, and reports that the construction was actually being continued were believed by them, s The occupation of territory which they considered rightly belonged to them, I refer to the Jawasim action at the villages of Mad-hah, Ghunah } and A1 Hair, further irritated them and the Shihuh from the hills were summoned to protect the ancestral lands and messages with the corner dramatically burnt off as a sign that the contents affect ed matters of life and death were sent to Muscat calling on their overlord for help. The total casualties during the recent hostilities are one killed on each side and one man wounded but I am in doubt if this last was a Jawasim or a Shihuh. 5 . The Jawasim have every right to object to the attitude and actions of the Shihuh and the Muscat Government are certainly at fault in not taking adequate steps to control their subjects but the Jawasim are also at fault for, as the Regent acknowledged to me, they made no complaint to the Muscat Government prior to the hostilities in November and so did not give the Sultan an opportunity to regularise the position. This failure to communicate with Muscat was due to the fact that for many many years the Jawasim have dealt direct with the Shihuh over tribal matters and do not seem to have considered Shihuh territory as Muscat territory. The tower is strategically useless, politically highly undesirable,and hat already caused trouble enough, and although I do not believe the Shihuh statement that the work of construction was continued after it had been agreed that it should cease, I consider that the estab lishment by the Jawasim of a guard on the building was not in accordance with the spirit of the agreement between the Regent and the Sultan. The occupation of the villages of Mad -hah j bhunah^and A1 Hair was /6 Hair was, to say the least of it, carried out at a very ill chosen time by invitation though it may have been. There is no doubt if the Muscat Authorities had exercised proper control in the Shihuh area the present situation would not have o arisen so that there is really very little to chpse between the two parties and I suggest that the past be not disturbed any further than it has been already and our attention be concentrated on the future# A truce has been negotiated to last two months during which time it is hoped that the questions of the tower and the villages of Mad-hahj Ghunah^and A1 Hair will be satisfactorily settled and provided the Sultan returns in time I see no reason why this should not be done and even if it takes longer than two months to complete the negotiations there could be no objection to the truce being extended. 6. I suggest that the Sultan should undertake to control his subjects in Dibah and that in return the Regent of Kalba should re move the tower. As regards the villages of Mad-hah, Ghunah,and A1 Hair the actual sovereignty should be determined between the two parties or if they prefer or fail to agree between themselves It should be referred to arbitration. If the decision goes against the Sultan then there is no more to be said and if the decision goes against the Regent then he can always say that he went there by invitation under a misapprehension and withdraw gracefully. These suggestions are on the whole acceptable to the Regent but he did not actually agree to the immediate demolition of the tower on the Sultans guaranteeing the good conduct of his subjects but preferred to retain the unfinished structure for one year to act as a reminder presumably of the Sultans undertaking nor did I mention the question of the method of determining the ownership of the area in dispute if they should be unable to agree on this ques tion. However I should prefer to see the tower removed and feel that Sheikh Khalid would not really raise any strong objection. I suggest I approach the Sultan on the above lines and at the same time I /time I propose to press him to put his own representative into Dibah, a course of action which would do much to reassure the Jawasim and would be beneficial to the Shihuh though it would possibly not be altogether appreciated by their Sheikh, Hassan bin Rahmah, who I trust will be replaced by a more reliable person. I have discussed the question fully with Khan Sahib Abdur Razzak who is I understand in agreement with my views on the situation. I have also had an opportunity since writing the major portion of this despatch of discussing the matter informally with Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, the Sultans uncle and Representative. He considered the Shihuh to blame and spoke of the Jawasim as being oppressed by them and viewed with much favour the appointment of a representative of the Muscat Government at Dibah (Shihuh). He seemed little interested in the three villages and I can only trust that his nephew's views will be as acceptable and conducive to the speedy settlement of the whole question.

Being afraid of the Shahuh they pressed Shaikh Humaid bin 'Abdullah for men to protect them. This was given to them when Humaid v/as on nis ijay to Kalba on 30th March. He sent few men oO each iila^e and re-established the Oawasim authority over* -hat area which, n or many years past, was under the influence o the Shahuh on account of the /awasim waekness. 3.

On 28th Safar 1360 (27th March 1941) Muhammad bin Ahmad the Amir of Bakha by previous agreement with Hasan bin Rahmah the Amir of the -'hahuh at Bai'ah, decided to send (a force of) 60 men. On the night of 28th Safar at about S Arabic at night they arrived at our town Diba when the people were quiet and unaware as they relied on the peace entered into between our son Shaikh Humaid bin 'Abdullah and the Shahuh through the mediation of Saiyid Badr bin Sa f ud, Wali of Khasab. reaching our town they fired at once on the residential quart- ers and the Marabba 1 ah (tower)• They also caused great damage to the date gardens, having spoiled the fruits and cut some or the trees. These are the savage acts of the ohahuh v ;ho do not abide by their pledges and undertakings but rely on treachery and cheating to which may be added the^r agressive acts against the poor people.

Memorandum - Reference your telegram No,79 of 15th April 1941, T beg to report the following on the subject of Shahuh/Oawaslm/ Diba situation:- (i) f All bin Mudhaffar, Wali of Shinas, arrived at Kalba on 13th April accompanied by Muhammad bin Nasir, Shaikh of Abu Baqarah (Muscat). After discussing the situation with Shaikh Humald bin 'Abdullah, nephew of the Regent of Kalba, he proceeded to Khor Pakkan. As a result of their discussions, the ''all of Shinas was authorised by Humari to enquire both on behalf of the T.uscat Authorities and the Oawasim and arrange what he considered best for all concerned. Humald also agreed to the suggestion made by the Wall of Shinas to ask the ohaikh oi Fujairah to accompany him and assist In putting an end to hostilities. On the 14th the '/all c^ Shinas left Khor Fakkan for Diba, accompanied by Muhammad bin Hamad ash-Sharqi of Fujairah. The Shaikh of ^ujairah remained at Hisn-Diba while the all 0- 3hinas and the Shaikh of Abu Baqarah went to Bai'ah. On 15th the ■ 7a11 of Shinas with the help of the bhaikns oi ^uhalrah and Abu Baqarah succeeded in arranging two months truce pending final agreement on return of the SultaA from India. (ii) /-(ii) On 14th Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kalba, arrived at. Kalba from Ajman in order 'to meet ^ke Political Agent, Muscat. (iii) On the morning of 16th, the Political Agent, Muscat, arrived by car and after remaining for a short while in the landing ground preceeded to Khor Fakkan from where he embarked on a dhow for Tiba. He was accom panied by the Wali of 3ohar, Mudhaffar bin Suwailim, Owing to strong Shamal they were compelled to take shelter at ^hadnah (about half way between Khor Fakkan and Diba) where they spent the night. On 17th morning the Shamal calmed down and the Political Agen^ left Dhadnah for Diba. (iv) I left Sharjah on the night of 15th and arrived at Kalba on the evening of 16th. I travelled via Siji and Wadi Ham. On the morning of mh T left Falba, accompanied by Shaikhs Khalid and '^umaid, for Khor Fakkan and from there left by sailing boat for Diba. Owing to head-wind we could not make much progress and at about 1 p.m. we met the Political Agent and the Walis returning from Diba after visiting Bai'ah and Hisn-Diba. We all returned to Khor Fakkan and then proceeded to Kalba. (v) On the night of 17th, a meeting, attended by the Political Agent, Muscat, Shaikhs Khalid and Humaid and \ myself, was held at which the whole situation was re viewed and discussed in details. The upshot oi it was that Shaikh Khalid is willing to take no reprisal action against the Shahuh in the future before informing the Muscat and Political Authorities provided the Sultan of Muscat undertakes to control the Shahuh and pay compensation for any damage or injuries the Shahuh may cause to the property and subjects of the Qawasim. Shaikh /- ✓N - 3 - Shaikh Fhalid admitted that the 'Murabba 1 ah' had been completed. He explained that the Shahuh attacked Diba-Hisn on the night of 27th March. That on the night of 28th March the Wali of Diba-Hisn restarted the work on the 'Murabba 1 ah' which he considered necessary for the protection of the inhabitants. He said that he was within his rights to build any number of towers within his territory for the protec tion of his subjects without prejudice to the inter ests of the Muscat authorities who were at liberty to 0 do what they liked in their territory. After one year from the date on which the Sultan undertakes responsibility for the Shahuh, Shaikh Khalid agreed to r^fse the 'Murabba 1 ah' to the ground if the Shahuh 1 s behaviour is satisfactory during this period, (ii) Regarding V'adi Madha. Sha .kh KhaTid said that since he became Regent of Kalba, the inhabitants of T r adi Madha have been pressing him for protection against maraudings by the Shahuh tjut in order to keep friendly with the Shahuh so that they may not create trouble for Daba he used to keep them off from time to time. As the Shahuh did not appreciate his good intentions and, contrary tc tribal customs, attacked Tiba-Hisn without ultimatum, he 'saw no alternative, in view o. the repeated appeals made to him by the people 6f Wadi Madha, than to protect them. He said that V'adi Madha paid Zakat to the Oawasim for about 100 years or more and the inhabitants were always considered as subjects of the Qawasim. That when Fujairah revolt ed against the Oawasim, the people of V/adi Madha we^e compelled by circumstc ; nces and owing to lack of Qawasim influence in that area, to seek the protection of /-- 4 - (It ) of the 3hahuh. That although the people of 7adi Fadha paid tribute to the Shahuh In return for pre .ec ^ in no tinie did the Muscat Authorities receive Za^at irom them. That the Oav^asim are in possession of a document signed by the Muscat autho- nties defining their boundaries and therefore the return 01 '. T asl Madha to the Qav/asim should not be considered by the Muscat Authorities as an act of agression directed against them. (vii) Shaikh Khalid said that the ohahuh sent false reports oc -he Muscat Authorities with the main ob/ect of in citing then against the ^awasim. In support of this he said that in the first attack on 27th March they hco. no casualties but they sent a special messenger to Muscat that they lost four killed. That only in the attack made about the 12th they had one killed cJiU one wounded and one killed on the Oawasim side. From enquiries made by the Political Agent, Muscat and mysel fjonly one killed and one vounded on the Shahhh and one killed on the Oawasim. (viii) The Political Agent, Muscat said that owing to the ucoerce o^ the Sultan of Muscat in India it would not be possible for his Hepresentative to decide anything I e expressed hope thai' a suitable solution would be jfr mode on his return. On the 18th morning the Political Agent left for Muscat by car. (ix) From enquiries made by me which were corroborated oi Abu Paqarah, the Shahuh numbered about loOO when he and the all of Shinas arrived at Bai'ah- T^iba on 14th, Most of them left for their villages in the hills after the truce on 15th. I'hen the Political Agent arrived at Bai'ah there were about 400 and /-and about 70 arrived In sailing-boats from Bakha av time the Political Agent arrived there. The force of the Oawaslm was about 200. I returned to 'harjah via '/adl -'at.;, Masafl and Sl^l on the nl ht of 2ist. Both the Political Agent and myself are of opinion * ''' ' un ess the fcuscat Authorities appoint a Wall at Bal'ah- ^'ba there can be no peace In that area and the Muscat Authorities would find it difficult to control the Shahuh. 3d.

Discussions were conducted through ^aiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim but without any results. According to Shaikh Khalid, Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim asked Shaikh Ehalid, on his arrival, to tell the Sultan when he meets him that he authorizes him to do what he considered best aboi t i.ne tovver at Diba and .-adi I.Iadha, as by doing so the -in MM!

The Sultan insisted on its return to the Shahuh whereas Shaikh Fhalid contested the 3hahuh f s claim to it and asked that the matter may be decided in accordance with the 3hara', tribal lav/ or documentary evidence but the Sultan would not listen to any argument on this point.

I do not myself, however, believe that the tower has been left unoccupied and a certain amount of justification for its occupation exists owing to the unsatisfactory way in which the Muscat State are treating the Shihuh question. 1 suggest therefore that the State be asked to drop the question of demolition of the murabba and that Shaikh Khalid be instructed to see that the tower remains unoccupied. 5. The Political Agent, Muscat, might also enquire regarding the allegation that parties of armed men are being sent by the Muscat State from the Batineh to Bai'ah, presumably with the intention of assaulting the Qawasim. If there is any truth in the report, as there possibly is, the State might be required to stop doing this and withdraw the men already i 6. As regard .a, please see my Express Letter No. C/590 dated the 12th June, paragraph 4. Shaikh Khalid has already been informed that his aggression on the Wadi Madha was very unwis^ and that we are not going to help him if any trouble results therefrom; but, as regards the 'Residency Agent's report, that Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah, Shaikh Khalid 1 s nephew, is trying to instigate the Beni Oatab, etc., against the Muscat authorities, in anticipation of your sanction I am instructing the PoliticalOfficer, Trucisl Coast, to send for Shaikh Khalid angL to warn him severely against any such action either on his part or on the part of his nephew and others. 7. I think Shaikh Khalid is acting in an unsatisfactory way. He is officially the Hegent of Kalba but he spends practically all his time in the vicinity of Sharjah instead of attending to his business at Kalba. Shaikh Khalid used to be the Shaikh of Sharjah until he was turned out by the present Shaikh and the only interpretation which can be placed on his constant residence in the vicinity of Sharjah is that he is up to some intrigue against the present Shaikh: in this connection vide corresoondence ending with my memorandum No. C/1145 dated the 8th December 1941. The whole district of Shamalyiah comprising Kalba, ^jairah Khor Fakkan, etc., on the east coast of Musandum is practically entirely cut off from the west coast, as I found on my recent visit there, and there is no valid reason why Shaikh Khalid should constantly absent himself.

I beg to enclose herewith copy (with translation) of a letter dated 4th Dhul Hijjah 1360 (i.e. 24th December 1941) which 1 have received from Shaikh Khalid, Regent of Kalba, on the subject of the Shahuh/Qawasira dispute. As the letter was ambiguous, 1 saw Shaikh, who was suffering from malaria in 'Dubai, and asked him to explain to me his real intention. He said that Muhammad bin Ahmad of Bakha did not agree to become Shaikh of the Shahuh, that Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Representative of the Muscat Govern ment, intends to appoint Hamdan bin Muhammad of the Shahuh as Shaikh and ' ali at Bai'ah, that the Representative demanded the demolishing of the Turabba'ah and return of v.adi Hadha without hearing any argument and that the Muscat authorities are send armed men from Batinah in 20 and 30 every day and concentrating them at Bai'ah. Shaikh Khalid said that as Hamdan bin Muhammad was Shahhi himself, his appointment would lead to more complications instead of putting an end to the trouble now existing and therefore the action of the Muscat Government is contrary to the agreement concluded in July. That he would not demolish the Murabbah before the Muscat Government comply with the terms of the agreement, namely, appoint another T /ali not from the Shahhuh and waive their claim against Wadi Madhafor which they have no right to claim. Having heard that Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah, who is now conducting negotiations with the Muscat Representative, was tr r ing to incite and instigate the Bani Oatab, Khawatir and Nu'aira tribes against the Muscat authorities, 1 advised Shaikh Khalid to try and settle matters by peaceful means and refrain from doing any act which might provoke trouble. Shaikh Khalid left for Dhaid on 26th and 1 have not heard f rom him since. Translation of letter dated 4th Ghul HiJJah 1360 (i.e. 24th December 1941) from Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kalba, to the Residency Agent, Sharjah. I write to inform you that Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim Representative of the Muscat Government, arrived at Diba in connection with the previous matters between us and the Shahuh. The attitude of the said person (Saiyid Ahmad) is one of injustice and aggression. He is also supporting and taking the side of the Shahhuh. ^ T is way of dealing is against justice and equity. Therefore, l request you to communicate to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf our complaint. It is the High British Government whose help is sought in order to prevebt injus tice and help the oppressed. All these parts are indebted to them for their help and good treatment. I therefore hope and request the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to give our case his careful consideration lest matters might lead to complications and trouble which we wish to avoid.V^A \ COMFIDEM-IAL.

On the 17th Jamad el Thani I received the following complaint from Shaikh Hamdan bin Ahmed Al-3huhi aixd his tribesmen against their neighbour's the Jawasim ; 1) Rebuilding of the tower which they formerly agreed to its dismantling and that it should not be built higher than it was after dismantling. 2) Construction of various buildings in contrary to the stipulations which prevent the construction of building of mud and stones. 3) The Jawasim show reluctance in recovering debts due from the Jawasim to Shihus. ^i) The Jawasim arrest, with the knowledge of the Shihus any person of them known to have committed a crime. I, after hearing these arguments from them decided to s«end two representatives to make enquiries in the matter and to Keep Kamdan in Muscat till their return. Accordingly Shuwain bin amir Alhousani and Rashid bin Salim Almamari who were in the company of the Minister for Internal Affairs when the agreement between these two tribes was made proceeded there. I enclose for your information a copy of taeir report. Ahmed bin Hasan one of the Jawasim 1 s leading men was present when the two representatives sent by me saw that the wall of the tower was made higher, the construction of the new surround ing walls and the building of two new stores. He said to Shaikh Kumaid that all these constructions were new. As regards items 3 and 4. These are to be decided according to law. The building of the tower and the other new constructions are however considered to be an offence from the Jawasim and a breach of the terms to which both the tribes had agreed. Each tribe possesses a copy of this agreement. It is therefore requested that you will please write to the Consul on the subject, so thut the Jawasim should keep on their boundaries and remove the stores and new buildings they have made. Both tribes should adopt a way that would ensure safety and peace between them and should try their utmost to avoid such moves wnich might lead to a great trouble in the long run.w1 ^ntial Ho.C/117.

Diba :ute Sir, Vv I h^ve the honour to refer to your Express Letter To. 1888-247 dated the 15th Noveiiber 1943 and to ehclose a report which I have received from the Political Officer on the Trucial Coast. 2 . The Shihu are a restless people and the Jawassim very rightly suffer from an inferiority complex. There will never be peace between the middle third and the upper third of the village of Diba until the Sultan of Muscat appoints a Wali to control the Shihu lands and that part of Diba which lies within his frontiers'. l^o.) Khassab is far too remote from Diba for it to be practica ble for the Wali of Ehassab to direct the affairs of Diba,though it mijht be possible for the Vali of Khassab to reside at Diba leaving a Naib at Khassab to look after the wants of the Royal Navy. This solution would possibly prove acceptable to the Sultan of Muscat as it would be the most economical arrangement, and I believe that the Sultan's principal objection to the creation of a new Waliat is that the salary will have 4 -o be found for the . ; /ali,and the Shihu would be unlikely to offer to contribute. 3. Arbitration has been tried in the past without success, the settlement of these disputes by mutual agreements has also been tried and the agreements have never been kept; a firm and heavy hand is what is required to keep these people in order e / I SL•/N I would prefer to see all the towers pulled down as towers are only a source of mutual irritation, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.

No. C/17-3/5(a) Sir, Subject ; Diba Dia lute T navs the honour to refer to your endoraament No.C/1638 dated the 29th November 1943. It a-&gt;pears from the oenultinate oara Q I of letter I o.lGSo/3 dfited the 8th Rajab 1362 fron the I T inistGr for Intei^mil Affaira, Llu^cat, to the Minister for External Affairs, I .useat that the question which the Muscat Grover'iment wish to have taken up with the ^awasim is that of the tower and other buildings only and not that of collection of debts or arrest of wrong-doers. The agreement referred to by the Tinister for External Affairs in his covering letter (No.353/1 dated the Ist September 1943) is presumably that reached on 2Sth December 1941, of which a copy is annexUr| A^o this letter. V ^ (At 2. On the 21st December I visited Diba and inspected the tower. It is no longer demolished down to the Kab s but j has been built up to nearly twice that height and loopholed. No surrounding wall or stores have, however, been constructed. It is clear therefore that the Qitwasim have broken the agreenienttentered into bv their representatives on 28th December 1941. 3. On my pointing out to them the extreme impropriety of this action they gave me the following reasons for it;— (a) i'hey contend that the r uscat authorities have not fulfilled complementary agreements entered into by their representatives on the same or allied subjects. In support of this thev have ^roduc«d 1 O v a document a copy of which is annexure B, showing that they had been promised Rs.600/- in consideration of demolishing the tower ^ Qo ? . if-U- (- h e Political Agent, ruacaVs telegram No.T/l36 dated the 24th larch 1943 refers)* They state that the tower was demolished down to the Fabs and its condition was inspected and approved by Kuscat representatives about a year after the date of the agreement. Shaikh Fhalid claims that the Muscat ^gr^cl /to-2— ■3D to refrain from interference in the 'adi Iladha but that they have fcince sent their agents there end. collected zakat, but the docu ments he produces in support of this do not rxrove that any such agreement was reached • (b) The object of constructing the tower was (as is made quite clear in the Political Agent, Iluscat's lett-r No. C/328 dated the 22nd April 1941 to the Hon'ble the Political 'Resident) to keep the Oawasim part of Diba safe from the maraudings of the Shihuh, and according to the agreement, this was to be attained by placing them under the control of the Wali of Khasab. According to tke Qawasim this expedient has been a comlete failure and they get no redress for the thefts frequently committed by the Shihuh in and around * their village: and this is hardly surprising as they have no com munication with Thasab by land and communication by sea is slow and uncertain. It is difficult not to sympathise with the wish of the Qawasim to protect themselves from the Shihuh and I think it is fair to stress the jurely defensive character of the tower. It is scar- / cely ICC yards from the Qawasim fort and I would estimate the dis tance from it to the creek which forms the boundary between the Dhuriyin and the Shihuh at 10CC yards and it is another §00 yards to the nearest houses of Bi^ah where the Shihuh live. (c) Finally Shaikh Kumaid bin Abdullah told me that the agree ment would never have been signed by the Falba representatives but for the necessity of feeding the 800 men whom the Muscat people brought with them to Kalba. Nearly Hs.2C00/- had been s-aent on food during the three days of the negotiations before the Kalba finances began to run low and the Shaikhs signed the agreement as the only alternative to disgrace. I cannot vouch for the truth of this story but it seems not unlikely that same such pressure was used. 4. Shaikh Hamdan bin Ahmad as Shihhi, 'Wall* of Bi'ah came to see me on 29th December and put the Shihuh case, '^heir main ob is that it is built on ground belongin^to the Jhihii. This o^ course joction to 'Che tower^s no xTly disputed by the Qawasim ana a|&gt;Tatars on the face of it unlikely as the tower is so very close to the fort and within the Qawasim village and because the documentary evidence which the Shihuh claim existed has been 'los^'. The Shihuh deny that the Qaififasim have been able to prove that any thefts h^ve been committed by them, ^he Regent of Falba has been asked for details of the illegal acts of the Shihuh an&lt;^ those ar^ 1 awaited. k w,— A -3- 5* I hava the honour to submit tha following oba^rvrntions and rQcomm^ndatlons. ^hy original complaint of tha Q«w«3ln that the Shihuh commit-thefts and acts of aggraaflion in their village remains unaltered and their original demand that the M uscat authorities appoint a non-Shihhi •a'li in Uiba is a rea sonable one. The expedient of a;) ■ointin^ a Shihhi as local re— pregentative of Muscat and of ^lacing Diba under the distant .'/ali oT fhasab has not been successful and the best solution of the problem is still that Muscat should appoint a non-Shihhi W«li in Diba. If this v;ere done 1 understand that the '^wasim would gladly 'demilitariss' their tower by demol.idhing it down to the kabs» Should it not prove possible to induce the Muscat Government to adjoint a wali j - consider that the onus of proving that the con struction of this tower is an aggression udou the ri;hts of their L'ubjects rests with them. i 1 h« submission of the matter to ar bitration with the following terms of reference seems to be the best solution;- (a) Can the 3hihuh orove that the tov/er has been constructed u^on land belonging to them ? (b) If not where does the Shihuh boundary lie ? hen the Shihuh-Qawasim boundary has been decided I can see no objection (and the ^aw«sim have none) to the Shihuh constructingTRANSLATION II T ^ NAL AFFAItrS DEPARTIIEKT.
