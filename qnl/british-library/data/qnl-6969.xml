Gathered from conversations held with— (1) Abdul Aziz A1 Qnsaibi, Bin Saud's Agent in Bahrein. (2) Fahad A1 Bassam, merchant of Qassim and Hassa. (3) Muhammad A1 Haw Was, merchant of Riyadh and Hassa. (4) Bedouin visitors from Bani Hajar, Bani Khalid Dwasir and others. 1. Bin Saud, who for the last nine months has been reiterating the determination of himself and the people of Kejd to Haj this year, has suddenly cried .off. This after His Majesty's Government had gone to great trouble to make all arrangements, such as collecting rations, &amp;c., and taking guarantees, &amp;c., from King Husain and Bin Saud regarding the conduct of their respective subjects during the Haj season. Bin Saud's excuses for his eleventh hour change of mind are— (a) That it is impossible for him to restrict the numbers of people who want to Haj from Nejd, especially if they know that he, their religious leader, has stcirt^d (b^ That it is equally impossible for him to restrict the number of his armed men, seeing that every youth from the day he can walk, almost, carries a • rifle'in Nejd. For him to interfere with such a time-honoured custom is entirelv impracticable, and would be greatly resented. ^ (c) That the matter had been settled so late in the day by His Majesty s Govern- ment, that with the best will in the world it was now too late to give notice throughout Nejd that any sort of Haj was to start. Government had firmly but quietly insisted on Bin Sand complying with their r-onnpsts that as few pilgrims as possible should go this year, and as few armed m e n. Hence Bin Sand's refusalto Haj gives the impression that the liuler ot Isejd, i nva l t0 His Majesty's Government, finding he cannot restrain his people noi ge tC to abide by Government's desires in the matter, has sacrificed his own wishes and interests in order to please His Majesty's Government, and show his regard for H ' sMSsrsafssnsx- »»»«&gt;• * His Majesty's Government and to the people of Nejd and Arabia generally.

IS or does a word of complaint come from his fire-eating puritan Ikhwan, who only a few months back were declaring they would Haj in spite of the whole world. In other words, Bin Saud and his people, the Ikhwan, have quite suddenly decided that to stay at home to-day is a more healthy occupation. 2. The change in the political atmosphere of Nejd is not far to seek, and may be put down in the first place to the murder of Saud al Rashid some time back and Bin Saud's efforts to bring Hail and Shammar under his suzerainty, and in particular to the events which have recently occurred resulting therefrom. Below I shall 1 endeavour to reconstruct and relate from the many contradictory stories and reports exactly what happened, giving a final note as to the courses open to Bin Saud, and the possibility of a big blaze in Arabia in the near future. 3. When the late Emir of Hail was murdered last April, Bin Saud informed His Majesty's Government that he had concluded an agreement with the Shammar to the effect that, though they would be permitted to manage their own internal affairs, he. Bin Saud, would order their foreign relations. Further, that the Shammar Bedouins were to be considered directly under himself. Bin Saud. This was correct as far as it went, but certain facts have been suppressed. As far as one can make out, the true facts of the above negotiations were something as follows. On the new Emir, Abdullah bin Mitaab al Rashid, coming to the throne, Bin Saud, knowing that he was only a boy, determined to take advantage of this fact and impose his will on Hail and Jabal Shammar. He was helped in his plans by the Qazi of Hail and the five chief citizens of that city. These had written an urgent letter inviting Bin Saud to seize Hail and the reins of government. Bin SSaud, it would appear, here made two mistakes. He thought his party in Hail was stronger than it really was, and he did not expect Aqab bin Ajil of the Abdah section to support the boy-Emir as whole-heartedly as he did, more especially as the latter was the son of a negress wife and not pure member of the Rashid family. As things turned out, however, the new Emir was at once supported by Shaikh Aqab and by one Ibn Zuemil Siujar, a principal citizen of Hail town. Aqab's first move was to move on Hail and take up his quarters there with Ibn Zuemil. Aqab's party at once disowned the actions of those citizens who, friendly to Bin Saud, had sent representatives to Riyadh, and signed the treaty which Bin Saud reported to Government. Bin Saud, hearing that this had happened, sent a trusty person of importance direct to Hail, to clear up what he thought to be a misunderstanding and to explain matters fully to Shaikh Aqab and to Rashidite party. Bin Saud backed up this messenger by a show of force in the shape of a small army of Ikhwan, 10,000 strong, under his son Saud. This column, which was already in Qassim, almost simultaneously with the arrival of Bin Saud's messenger in Hail moved forward in concentrated form to the frontier town of Tailiyah. Saud's orders would seem to have been to strike should the Hail situation turn out unfavourably. Mews of this force's movements were, however, faithfully reported to Shaikh Aqab bin Ajil. The latter, suspecting treachery, decided that the bolder course was to break with Bin Saud then and there. He at once ordered the Qazi and the five leading citizens of Hail, whose sympathies were known to be with Bin Saud, to be brought before him, and in the presence of Bin Saud's ambassador had them executed in the market place. The ambassador himself was allowed to return in safety. Simultaneously with his reporting himself to the young Saud at Tarfiyah, the latter launched three attacks into Bin Rashid's country. First attack, under the young Saud, reached Baqaa, 30 miles north-east of Hail. It lifted a large number of sheep and camels and returned to Tarfiyah without any loss. Second attack, under Ibn Rabian of the Ataiba, and Faisal al Dawish of the Mutair, raided completely round Hail, and attacked Sidr to the north of that town, but finding their force &lt;4 en Fair ' and liable to be cut off, they also retreated without loss, having accomplished little beyond picking up a few camels and sheep. Third attack, under Ibn Humaid Shaikh of Al Ghatghat, Ataiba, moved on Shaiba, some 75 miles north of Buraida. The ikhwan were at first successful and fought a short sharp engagement, capturing much booty. As the force turned to retire again it was attacked on all sides by Shammar horsemen and camelmen in the vicinity of Qusaibah. Shammar were in greatly superior force, and in a short time the retirement of Ibn Humaid lost its orderly nature and developed into a rout. All booty captured was abandoned and it became a case of every man for himself.

(2) Sheikh Ibrahim Bin Znbeir. (3) bheikh Khazal of Mohammerah. {^) Syed Talib Pasha of Basra. Bin Rashid now joined the group, forming, in addition, a defensive and offensive agreement with Sheikh Salem. It is repoited also that bheikh Salem and Bin Rashid both wrote letters to King IIuFsein, informing bim of events, and asking him to join the anti-Ikhwan League. More recent news shows also that Al Aida and Faqir, of the Madain Saleh group (Anazah), have visited Hail, and offered to join the confederation against Bin Saud^ Incidentally I am told, though I am inclined to disbelieve the report, that Bin Saud has captured a further letter from Sheikh Salem of Koweit to King Hussein, which gives the whole anti-Bin Saud conspiracy away. Bin Saud, it is said, for his own ends is saying nothing about these letters for the present. 5. The above reports, though borne out by fully reliable corroborative evidence, may be true or only partly true. One has learnt by experience to treat all such Arab news with the greatest caution. My chief informant is Fahad al Bassam. He is a Qassimite, and I think rather against than for Bin Saud. The general trend of Arabian news to-day, however, goes to show that two groups are gradually being formed : the northern group, consisting of Harb, Hutaim. Madain Saleh, Shammar, Shafir, Zubair and Koweit, centring round the standard of Bin Rashid, the old antagonist of the Bin Sauds ; the southern group, consisting of Nejd proper, including Hassa, the Idrisi and Trucial Oman. King Hussein would, of course, support the northern group. o j Of the two groups, the greater fighting strength lies with Bin baud undoubtedly, while the greater resources (in money) probably lie with the northem gioup. In the long run, should it come to an indecisive war, the northern group, with the money of Zubair, Koweit and Hejaz, would probably win • j- . j Bin Saud's only chance of success would be for him to secure an immediate and overwhelming victory over Bin Rashid. Undoubtedly the fear of the Ikhwan movement is what has drawn together the northern league. fi On the other hand, there is little doubt that a heavy defeat of Bin Saud would have a disastrous effect on his fortunes. The Arab, especially the Bedoum an adept at leaving a sinking ship. Success is the only thing that counts with u Bin Saud's stern, semi -military regime is not entirely popular with the Bedoum n. ijiu , p t^v, ttnryioth tvirmo-li not as serious is V.i*m Hm baud s stern, j V i w v Ttt recent defeat of Bin Saud's General, Bin Humaid, though not as serious of Nejd. f he recent deteat^ ^ alarm Bin Saud. The most exaggerated as reported in ; g t have ^een spread by the Shammar and the Sheikh of reports about '^ D « a f value of ttillg first news into the market. A report, Koweit, ^ ho ^° hed Koweit recently, that Hassa was in a turmoil and prepared to houevei, . • Sand is entirely untrue. The Governor ol llassa. Bin Jdovi, SntinuesTo rule sternl^ and well. The report probably rose from the fact that4 recently Bin Jilovi had occasion to order a Shiah inhabitant of Hoffuf to be beaten to death for cursing in public Bin Saud, the Ikhwan and the religion of the Ikhwan. The execution caused great resentment among Hassa Shiahs. At the same time, in fairness to Bin Jilovi, it may be recounted that during the same week he ordered an Akh to be executed in exactly the same way for being caught seducing a married woman. In Qatif, owing to the behaviour of certain Ikhwan, who have demanded that Shiahs should cease their readings (Qaraiyas) in their Husseiniyehs, much resentment exists against the Ikhwans. The Emir, Abdur Rahman Bin Swelum, has returned from Riyadh, and his strong arm may be trusted to keep things quiet. It is possible the Qatif Shiahs, who are adepts at making mischief, may present a memorial to this Agency detailing their wrongs. I trust they do not. 7. To turn to Bin Saud and his enemies. Undoubtedly he fears Shammar. Zubair, Koweit and Hejaz he despises, though he knows how dangerous are their intrigues. For all his recent talk about attacking Koweit, it may be taken as certain that he will do no such thing. Firstly, he knows he would be up against us, and realises that His Majesty's Government cannot stand still and see Kovveit become a province of Bin Saud. Personally, I am not sure but that it would not be one of the soundest bits of policy we could adopt to let Bin Saud over-run and conquer it, much as he did Hassa. It would once and for all settle the Bin Rashid question and make Bin Saud the dominant factor in Arabia. As this is not a likely contingency, it behoves us to look round and see what line Bin Saud is likely to take. That he must act and act within the next two or three months is certain. Two courses are open to Bin Saud :— (1) Open war with Bin Rashid and his friends. (2) To gain his object over Bin Rashid by diplomatic action. I do not think he will adopt (1), as the risks to his empire in case of defeat are too great. He knows how difficult successful operation against Bin Rashid would be in summer. There is not a well or waterhole anywhere throughout Shammar territory which has not got a party of Rashidite scouts sitting on it. The element of surprise is therefore from the start denied Bin Saud. Ordinary raids, which are always open to him, will not accomplish much. In fact, in this game Bin Rashid would probably fare best. Shammar are united with the exception of those Bedouins who have turned Ikhwan and trecked south into Nejd. On the other hand, Qassim is a suitable field for Shammar intrigue, and raiders from the north would not necessarily be received as enemies. Diplomacy or course (2) I think is the line Bin Saud will adopt. It should be noted here that Bin Saud in matters diplomatic is without rival throughout Arabia. He is capable of making rings round Bin Rashid in this respect. His blulf, candid and open-hearted manner serve to act as cover for one of the astutest brains that can be found. The Anazah, I think, are the means by which Bin Saud is most likely to try and accomplish his ends. Ihe bait he will offer is Jauf al Amr. From time immemorial the Anazah have claimed this oasis. Their recent seizure of it and their final ejection by Bin Rashid has made them very bitter against Shammar. Bin Saud is himself of Anazah stock, and an appeal from him need not be in vain. What easier than to offer Anazah the rich Jauf lands and assistance in helping them get it? Bin Safld will only demand in return to be recognised by the Anazah as overlord of Bin Rashid with a Saudite Governor at Hail. With fehammar attacked from north and south simultaneously, neither Koweit nor Hejaz will be of much help. In fact, in such a war Koweit trade with Hail could be stopped at once merely by cutting trade routes. The Mutair or Ajman would be sufficient for the purpose. 8. The question here arises, ' Would it be to the interest of His Majesty's Govern ment to see Bin Rashid once more a vassal of Nejd ? ' I think it would. A strong Central Arabia under Bin Saud, and he on absolutely friendly terms with the British Government, would, I venture to think, suit British policy down to the ground It would solve many difficulties and incidentally make all the small coastal States very much more dependent on us than they are now. Kow^eit, Bahrein, Trucial Coast Oman lemen Hejaz, and even Syria, would all live in terror of their powerful neighbour, and would be more amenable to the wishes of His Majesty's Government than they are to-aay At the present time, all these coastal States, as a result of the Great W ar and much talk of the ' rights of small nations,' have, so to speak crotwind in the head ' TV. ^ roin the rjo-ht TVTt]. r r 7 y are without discinlinp nnri o x il menace to thou, ' u y woulcl b e tlie first to saueal if 16 eVer want ing to stiav Saud would think twiop tlle y aU know well that «ilh P0 7 erful neighbour were feel like the fox that H ia 16 5eudin g a la '-ge force anv l^ 0n f Bin Rashid . ^ Aey are faitlv safe fr 0 u ? a, '- e f fe ^ ^on the Tail of r 0 ' 1 Ne i d - i'hey 'ore than anything aTiX' 8 8 ' ^ coasta l State! t^fore '-, ^' The y The Arab way i s to pv! ,1 i 1S1V ® and wasting war betwp^n n q ] alwa y s welcome the same time, it he cannot ^i 18 P owerf «l neighbours'-Km 1 ' * au '-l L ' !in I'ashid.' back on.

One thing would be' a so iitely and entirely fatal to all Bin Sand's plans; in fact, I personally think it '?' l T §. 0 fer J 0 bring about his ruin. We must not stop his subsidy, the ™ . c 1 1 ^ 0W ^ ets m onthly, through Bahrein, is spent entirely in the form of minor subsidies for his powerful Nejd Sheikhs. Like all Arabs, Bedouin or settled, you can do anything with them by giving their leaders suitable subsidies, however small. Bin baud knows this well, and especially realises it to be true of Kejd which is far more loosely knit together than Bin Rashid's Shammar, for instance. What Bin Saud does require from us to-day is more outward support, if we cannot give him money, then we should let him see, as far as we possibly can, that we do intend to stand by him, and do not intend allowing petty States like Koweit and Bahrein to annoy him under the protection, so to speak, of Great Britain. The recent Customs decision in favour of Bin Saud at Bahrein is a good instance of how we can support Bin Saud. The order has certainly had the finest effect on Sheikh Isa. His behaviour towards the Political Agent has much improved. We can do a great deal also by such action as the conferring on Bin Sand of, say, a G.C.S.I, or some other equally high honour. During the coming autumn it would also be an excellent act of policy if a small mission, consisting, sa}', of the Political Agent, Bahrein, accompanied by a British Medical Officer and another, were to visit Riyadh. Bin Saud wants to be 2462 B6 .... _ n tt iioG the greatest respect foi made a fuss of. He is devoted to tlie Brltlsh 'Pf soui t i J' bv^post and telegraph, Sir Percy Cox.

I managed to leave the impression, I think, m bin am s mni that at any rate in Bahrein he had one to champion him, 1 he visit v.as equa y valuable from His Majesty's Government's point of view. As I mentioned at t le trnm, Bin Saud wants some one to talk to, and some one whom he knows will convey alJ he has to say to higher authorities. A British officer, with possibly two others, should be sent each cold weather if possible, not an Indian Mussalman again. ihe biggei the man, the more Bin Saud will feel honoured. The mere presence of such a mission in Riyadh will do more than anything else to advertise the fact to the people of Arabia that His Majesty's Government is on the best of terms with the ruler of Nejd, and means to support him. This is what Bin Saud wants. As he puts it, ' Jiddam al 'Arab arid al hakumah takabirni ' (' Before the Arabs I want the Government to make me big).' According to Abdul Aziz al Qusaibi, Bin Saud is not afraid in the very least of any direct action on the part of the Koweit-Bin Rashid-Hejaz combination. What he does fear is the campaign of calumny which he knows people like the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Zubeir, also Syed Talib, will now start. He knows how clever the Arab of Iraq is at such a game; he believes also that the above people's advice is listened to by the Baghdad authorities. He feels lie has no champion at Government headquarters. He fears that as a result of such campaign he will lose credit in Government s e3'es, and that perhaps his subsidy may be reduced. I remember Bin Saud saying to me, ' Antum ya Inglis takhdun hachi an \as (' You English listen to people s gossip 'The sentence sums up Bin Saud's feelings to-day. 10. 1 here are signs that Salem is once more trying to seduce the Ajman from their newdy-formed allegiance to Bin Saud.
