Sir, I have 'Lhe honour t.0 forward herewith copies of a correspondence which has 'Oaken place during t.he past&gt; week between Monsieur Laronce and myself in connect/ion wioh t.he French flag negociations, and, in so doing, '00 refer 00 my levoer No.l£0 daoed Zrd Insoano. 2.- From recent, conversations with M. Laronce I saw ohat, he wished t.o arrive at/ Sur some days before our enquiry from t.he dhow ovmers was x.o oake place, and 'Ohat, he considered ohat, t.he result, of such enquiry should be t/aken as t.he final set/Llement. of tjie. pb.irit, involved.. I was unable for obvious reasons t.o assent. t,o t»his, and addressed t.o him my levoer No. 16^ dated the 13t.h Instant (enclosure 1). M. Laronce's reply (enclosure 2) needs no comment, beyoned that it is interesting to note his change of front regarding the dhows, and difficult to resist a smile at his courageous reference to the matter reported in my letter No. £20 dated 16th November last.- A copy of my reply is attached (enclosure S).

His Majesty's Government will make such arrangements as are required on their part for the due execution of those portions of the Agreement which relate to French prot^g^s, and, without entering into the juridical question of the right of the Zanzibar Government to expel the Nationals or proteges of foreign Powers by administrative process, they are willing to give an assurance that no such action shall be taken against French citizens or prot^g^s without the concurrence of the French Consul.

Sir, Foreign Office, February 8, 1906. I HAVE laid before Secretary Sir E. Grey your letter of the 19th ultimo, on the subject of the negotiations between the British and French Consuls at Muscat for the carrying into effect of the recent Arbitration Award. ' With regard to the points of difference between the two Consuls, Sir E. Grey concurs in the terms of the reply which the Government of India propose to return to Major Grey respecting points 1 and 2. As regards point 3, viz., the French claim to jurisdiction in Muscat over an Omani accused of having committed a crime on the high seas while sailing in a dhow flying the French flag, Sir E. Grey is advised as follows :— If the Omani in question leaves the ship and proceeds on shore, he comes at once under the jurisdiction of the Sultan, and is not justiciable by the French Consul. On the other hand, the Sultan, and therefore His Majesty's Government, has no valid ground of complaint if, without being landed, he is transhipped for trial at Obokh or some other place within French territory ; nor would it be reasonable to object if the man were merely landed so as to enable the French Consul to make arrangements for his being sent for trial before a Court in French territory. Objection should, however, be taken to his being tried by the French Consul at Muscat, Sir E. Grey would propose, if Mr. Secretary Morley concurs, that His Majesty's Consul should be authorized to inform his French colleague of the conclusions arrived at by His Majesty's Government on the three points at issue, and to endeavour to effect a settlement on the lines laid down. No previous communication with the French Government would, in the circumstances, be necessary. The suggestion with regard to the withdrawal of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 has received careful consideration, and I am directed by Sir E. Grey to state that he considers that it would be quite useless at present to approach the French Govern ment in the matter, unless His Majesty's Government were prepared to offer them some considerable equivalent elsewhere. In some years time, when the gradual disappearance of the French flagholders will have reduced French interests in Muscat to a minimum, the proposal might possibly be put forward more opportunely and with greater chances of French acquiescence.

Sir, I have t,he honour t,o refer t,o t,elegram No. 1961 E. B. dat^ed l4'Dh Instant, from t.he Government of India in t/he Foreign Departiirent, t.o my address. I am directed therein to submit a brief report of the net result of my negociations with Monsieur Laronce in connection with the arbitration award in the French flag difficulty. 2.- Monsieur Laronce and I were directed, (1) to con sult as to the oest method of making known to the subjects of Eis Eighness the Sultan of Oman the result of the arbitration, and (2) to make out a list of such persons who are henceforth to be entitled to fly French flags in accordance with the terms of the award. With reference to (1), we agree that the result of the arbitra tion should be communicated by Eis Eighness the Sultan to his subjects by means of a proclamation to be issued by him.. In regard to (2), we are unable to agree as to the list of per- sons who are to oe entitled to fly French flags according to the terms of the award* The reasons for our lack of concord in this matter are:.- (i). Monsieur Laronce holds that authorisation to flyfly 'Dhe French flag was given 'Do each and every owner once for all, 'Dhati is t,o say for every dhow of which he might. subsequent,ly become t.he possessor ; whereas I hold, in accordance with instructions received, 'that, authorisation was given in regard to individual dhows only. M. Laronce professes to be unable to inform me as to the date on which each individual dhow obtained its first titre de navigation. Monsieur Laronce maintains that his Government will be obliged to insist not only upon their views in regard to point (i) oeing accepted oy us, out also that each authorised dhow owner should oe allowed to replace any dhow at present in his possession of which he might subsequently become dispossessed by sale or by loss. Monsieur Laronce wishes not only that all the owners named in the list presented by him to me on the 4th March last should preserve authorisation to fly French flags, but that all the dhows named in his list should be registered as oeing the property of the persons against whose names they have been entered. As a result of careful enquiry I have found (1) that some of the dhow owners are not, according to our view, entitled to authorisation as they do not actually possess a dhow-at the present time; and (2) that many of the dhows are not the property of the persons against whose names they have oeen entered. Monsieur Laronce has not accepted the views of His Majesty's Government in regard to the four subjects i of His Highness the Sultan for whom protection in Zan zibar has been obtained by the French according to the Anglo-French agreement of ISth May 1904 (Nos.17 - 20 in the French list above referred to). He has refer red this point to his Government. Owners Nos.3 and IS in the French list might, in my opinion, be regarded as French proteges in Oman; butbut, M. Laronce could not, agree t.o my proposal 'Chat, 'Oheir positiion as such should be accepted by us in exchange for 'Ghe views of His Majest.y's doverninen T . in regard t,o Nos.17 - 20 being accepted by t,he French, It; is impossible t,o formulate t,he proclamat,ion t,o be issued oy -ohe Suit,an unt,il t,he list, of owners and dhows has been agreed upon, and 'Che exact, condit,ions in which t,he French flag is to be flown by 'Ohem have been fixed. ^ - A copy of -ohis let,t,er has been forwarded t,o t,he Government; of India in t,he Foreign T;epart,ment,.

I informed him that I had forwarded a copy to the Government of India by the earliest opportunity, but he seemed to think that I had broken faith with him in not sending another to the Foreign Office direct..

Agent at Maskat to my address. (2). In the communication first quoted Major Grey, who had been directed to report the net result of 1m negotiations with his colleague, enumerates five points with regard to which he ai d Monsieur Laronce have found it impossi ble to come to an agreement. These can be more conveniently considered under threo heads:— (1) The legal interpretation of Fort 71, Item 2 of* the Award,— • Sub Fnclo. (1) in Knclo. in Pro. No 292 in Secret Monsieur Laronce ^ Still e., October loos, Kos. 244-3 ^1. claims that once it is ad mitted that a particular Maskati falls within one of the catego ries authorised under Part l of the Award, then, under 1 art 11. (a) He is entitled to fly the French Flag over any and every dhow which he now possesses or may over possess, and is not limited to the dhow or dhows specilieally mentioned by name in the revised French list of March 4;th, 1903. (5) He is entitled to replace any dhows lost or sold. Point M has already been thoroughly gone into in connection with Major t Pro.No. 166 to s.«.t e .. r.bra.r, im , s« Groy'sf telegram of 3rd December 1905 182181. to the Foreign Department. ^ On that occasion the Government of India, relying on the reading of the award as a whole, and by the light of Mr. Ronald Graham s explanatory t Enclosure In Pro. No. 292 io Secret E, Ocloboc despatch j o£ tUl August 1J0 , ^ 1905. Koa. 2.4-321. if an individual s authorisation was origi nally a general one for all his dhows, then he would retain that general right under the terms of the award; but that if, on the other hand, the original authorisations were for individual dhow or dhows by name, then authorisations for those same dhows only could be claimed under the award. This view was endorsed by His Majesty's Secretary of State in his telegram, dated 21st Feb ruary 1906. Now with reference to the above, it will be seen from the correspondence that on being asked to produce a copy of the original authorisation tor each dhow claimed, or to quote the date of first issue, the French Consul has ex pressed his inability to comply ; nevertheless he cannot dispute the evidence available in our recorded specimens of ' 'litres de Navigat ion w m - i ^ an an s the presumption that in the past the authorisations issued have in all cases been r, v • rmdo out for single dhows bv name and Sub enclosures 8»-ll in Enrlo. in Pro. J\o. 41 m maUC . 0 x&gt; i. f r» -nrk Sceret E., September 1 9 0D Noi. 5-56. n ot ill a general tomi. JiUt acting HO doubt on instructions from his Government, Monsieur Laronce claims that the first authorisation, even though only issued for a single dhow, came wi 11 the right to fly the French flag over all dhows which the owner might ever possess. The local officers have done their best no doubt to come to an understand- O ing generally, but seeing that the views of their respective Governments an the instructions which they have received on this, point are so divergent i was not possible that they should be able to settle it themselves. It does not seem to me that the French view can hold water for a moment, but the reason or their anxiety to hurry us into accepting it not far to seek. 11 our interpre a tion is accepted then the number of dhows entitled to sail under i rench colours will be limited to such cf those mentioned by name in the French list, as t c inquiries of our representatives on the spot prove to be the sole propcity o^ per sons recognised by the award, and to have received their authorisations before t e 45' 4Z CWFD committal of the issues to the Hague Tribunal. These will be very few, —not more than the 14 provisionally admittted by Major Grey,—and it will be a simple matter to keep a check on them in the future, even if we agree to allow them to be replaced within the life-times of their owners, so long as the original name is adhered to. On the other hand if the French carry their point and it is held that the fact of having received an authorisation for one dhow entitles an owner to fly the flag over all dhows of which he may ever become possessed, then, after the negociations are once concluded, we shall have no checked whatever nor any practical means of knowing at any given time how many and what dhows are sailing under the French flag. French Consuls will pursue their hobby just as unscrupulously in the future as they have in the past; on the pretext of part- ownership, the dhows of all a flayrholder's kinsmen will be registered in his name, and in the result the award which we have been at infinite pains to win, wilj be shorn of half its effect. It is of the utmost importance to us that the notification which will be ultimately promulgated among the subjects of the Sultan of Maskat shall contain the names not only of the persons which have qualified but also of the dhows which are entitled, to carry the flag. There^ can, I submit, be no doubt that the interpretation which we wish to impose is the one intended by the framers of the award and I earnestly hopo that nothing will deter us from the endeavour to secure its acceptance. Possibly His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will succeed in convincing the French Government that our reading of the terms of the award is the correct and legitimate one. If. however, his efforts is that direc tion are not successful, then I can only venture to suggest that a statement of the points at issue should be drawn up by our respective Governments in con sultation and referred to an Arbitrator It may be that there is some provision for such contingencies in the articles or working rules of the Hague Conven tion and, indeed, it would seem a natural corollary to a settlement by the Tribu nal that any question of doubtful interpretation of the terms of an award should be referred for decision to the Umpire who sat on the original Court which delivered it. Point (6) might be dealt with in the same manner, but if the French accept our view as to («) or if it is eventually decided by an Arbitrator in our favour, then we might concede (b). It would under those circumstances be a very important consideration // to us. (iii). The Status of the 6 individual whom the French claim as pro teges under the Anglo-French Agreement) dated 13th May 1904, in connection icith Zanzibar. In regard to this question the Secretary of State cabled his wishes on 6th March. I gather that his view was that supposing that Monsieur Laronce agreed acce P^ Major Grey's suggestion that the cases of the first four men named should be decided according to the conditions of the Hague Award, then Major Grey might reciprocate by waiving discussion with regard to the last two, and that that solution of the question might subsequently be imposed upon the Sultan of Maskat. As, however, Monsieur Laronce did not accept Major Grey's offer, and as the French Minister in the statement mentioned in the Secretary of State's telegram of 2Gth .April evidently intended to refer to the case of all six men, entitled to conclude that Major Grey's offer to Monsieur Laronce is oil , and that the status of the six Omanis mentioned in the Zanzibar Agree- r( ' rna ' n B lor adjustment in London. On this presumption I venture to oiler the following observations, O i'Nr ^ two last men, Muharek bin Mahomed (No. 21) and Jumabin Mubarek f* i I, be Amirfe£ a well known tribe of Oman. It is not sug- r 4 / ges ed that they were horn out of Oman. On onr present information there- / sre xv ky ^ should in anv case regard them as proteges, even if r/ they are admitted as fl'.ff. holders ' ^ 4(&gt;C172FD or no difficulty in the matter of the verification of dhoves even if there is as to the title of owners. It is on the redaction of this list to the smallest possi ble limits that depends the degree of benefit which the interests of the Sultan and ourselves will derive from the award; and I am of opinion that before th e r oll is finally accepted, His Highness should be give n anjopBpll3IlUt3u5 Lputtjng forward any valid objontion which lio may hwo to the inclusion of any particu lar owner or dhow. He can he depended upon to behave reasonably in 'this regard. It is only necessary to review the history of the list and to peruse Major Grey's comments upon it, in order to realise the perfunctory, not to say unscrupulous manner in which the framing of it has been conducted by French Officials, with the support of their Government. Por this they cannot plead the excuse of haste because they have been periodically pressed for it for some years past. After evading its presentation as long as possible, they first claimed 30 owners and 56 dhows. This was subsequently reduced to 26 owners and 50 dhows and latfefer, in M. Laroncc's list of 4ith March to 22 owners and 46 dhows^while the evidence collected from several sources by Major Grey reduces the numbers io 14 owners and 13 dhoxes. It is instructive too to note that among those included by the French is one Hoded bin Nasib, No. 14, who if he had his desert should now be doing 25 years penal servitude at Angola with those of his comrades who formed the Suri slaving fleet captured by the Portuguese at Samuco in 1902 with several hundred newly caught slaves in their possession. Other facts, sucb as the inclusion of dead men, and men without boats, and the boats of relations, all demonstrate the untrustworthiness of the information supplied by the French representative and the necessity for the subjection of the list to deliberate scrutiny before it is accepted. (4) In conclusion, I beg again to urge that our best course is to take our stand on the judicial interpretation of the award. We have been at much labour and expense in order to bring about the settlement of this important question, both on the Sultan's account and our own ; it was our own suggestion to refer it to the Hague Tribunal ; we have secured from that Tribunal a very reasonable award which if fairly interpreted will give us practically all we want. I submit that this question of correct interpretation is no subject for quid pro que negociation except within the field covered by the award, and that it can in no wise be regarded by the French as unfriendly on our part to wish to have the decision of the Tribunal interpreted with judicial precision and in the manner intended by the framers of it. Of the extent of the inconvenience which may be caused to His Majesty's Government by some slight delay in the winding up of the case I am not in a position to be aware, but, speaking from the point of view of the local officer, I am convinced that we have nothing to lose by proceeding with such deliberation as will enable us to secure the Utmost that the terms of the award, judicially interpreted, will give us. In fact it is just as much to our specific advantage to take our time and go into the details thoroughly, as it is an advantage to the French to hustle us through them. 'When the award is completely executed in the manner advocated, we shall surely find the French in a much weaker position at Maskat, and after the lapse of a decent interval we shall be able to open negociations with them with incomparably better chances of success, whether it be in regard to the Arms Traffic, the Abrogation of the Declaration of 1862, or any other question affect ing Maskat which it is important to us to have settled.

THE French Minister made to-day a communication to the following effect regarding the Muscat Arbitration Award :— The negotiations between M. Laronce, French Consul at Muscat, and Major Grey, His Majesty's Consul, relative to the application and interpretation of the Award of the 8th August, 1905, appeared to have settled the difficulties which had originally arisen. The French Government were therefore very anxious that His Majesty's Government should accept the list of French dhow-owners drawn up by their Consul, and delivered to the British Consul on the 4th ultimo. M. Geoffray added that M. Laronce had inserted in this document the names of certain Arabs who were included in the Agreement signed at London on the 13th May, 1904, regarding the Zanzibari dhow-owners. These natives were, indeed, wrongfully claimed by the Sultan of Muscat as his subjects, and it was advisable to guard against any incident arising in the future with regard to them. I am, &amp;c.

M [June 27.] CONFIDENTIAL. S eciion 1. [20052] No. 1. Foreign Office to India Office. gj rj Foreign Office, June 27, 1906. I HAVE laid before Secretary Sir E. Grey your letters of the 28th ultimo and the 11th instant relative to the Muscat Arbitration Award. Sir E, Grey notes that the negotiations between the British and French Consuls at Muscat have' resulted in an agreement as regards (1) the best method of notifying the Award to the subjects of the Sultan, but that they have been unable to agree as to (2) the list of such persons who are still authorized to fly the French flag. I am directed by Sir E. Grey to state that he has carefully considered the French proposals for a settlement, as set forth in M. Laronce's letter of the 20th April, and that he is disposed to concur in principle with the criticisms advanced by Major Grey in regard to them. He considers, however, that it is manifestly to the advantage of His Majesty's Government to obtain an early settlement of this question, whereas the interest of the French Government cannot, with equal force, be said to lie in the same direction, and that it would be worth some sacrifices, if not of a vital nature, in order to secure this object. Moreover, it will be remembered that, as no French papers can in the future be issued to fresh dhow-owners, the death of the present flag-holders must automatically bring the whole question to an end within a limited space of time, and this fact renders it all the more desirable to dispose, by reasonable concessions, of what might well prove a source of present irritation and friction if the negotiations are unduly prolonged. I am therefore to suggest, for Mr. Morley's consideration, that His Majesty's Government should accept the whole list of flag-holders submitted by the French Government, without raising any further question as to the validity of the titles they enjoy; and further, that, in spite of section 2 of the second portion of the Award, which debars the transmission of the French flag from one dhow to another, it should be permitted that the papers of one dhow, which has been lost, sold, destroyed, or utlirnvisc disposed of, should be transferred to one other dhow belonging to the same Ow iirr. Tt should, hoAvever, be made clear that these concessions only apply in regard ^ to vessels duly authorized to fly the French flag under the terms of the Award, and that the number of dhows thus authorized can in no case be increased. The views already expressed by His Majesty's Government on the point raised regarding jurisdiction on the high seas or in Muscat waters should be maintained. In accordance with the suggestion made by Major Grey, the punishment attending any infraction of the new arrangement might be notified to the subjects of the Sultan, and the French flag-holders might be informed that they are at liberty to surrender their papers should they desire to do so. ' I am to state that, in the event of the Secretary of State for India agreeing '•enerally in the course suggested above, Sir E. Grey proposes to cause a Memorandum to be prepared for presentation to the French Ambassador, which will be previously submitted for Mr. Morley's concurrence. In the first instance, however. Sir E. Grey would be glad to be favoured with any observations or suggestions which Mr. Morley may desire to make on the subject. I am to add that the French Ambassador has again called Sir E. Grey's attention to the question, and has requested an early expression of the views of His Majesty's Government. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) E. G ORST.

As His Majesty's Consul had decided not to submit any counter proposals and had forwarded to His Majesty's Government the draft received from his French colleague, the latter was justified in thinking that his proposals had received Major Grey's approval. M. Laronce had up to the present received no reply, and he had ascertained that Major Grey had given up his intention of forwarding the draft to London, and had sent it to the Government of India. This no doubt accounted for the delay. M. Cambon, in calling my attention to his previous representations on this question, requested me to take all possible steps to arrive at an early solution of a matter which was of no very great importance and which, in view of the good relations existing between our two countries and of the conciliatory attitude of the French Government, could be settled without difficulty by simply accepting the proposals formulated by the French Consul at Muscat and accepted by His Majesty's Consul. I informed M. Cambon that he is under a misapprehension in thinking that His Majesty's Consul at Muscat was in agreement with the proposals advanced by his Fiench colleague. Major Grey, on the contrary, disagreed so completely with M. Laronce that he considered it useless to formulate counter-proposals, and had referred the matter to His Majesty's Government. M. Laronce's proposals were, I added, now under consideration of His Majesty's Government, and a communication would shortly be addressed to his Excellency on the subject. I am, &amp;c.

After full consideration of your telegrams of the 10th and 26th July 1906 and the correspondence including Major Cox * s letter of the 26th June 1906, His Majesty's Government have decided to adopt the course Indicated in my telegram of the 5th ultimo. The French Government will be asked to arrange for the notification to the Sultan of the papers that were transferred in the circumstances referred to in your telegram of the 10th July last and also for an annual list of surviving flag-holders and dhows; and for a copy of the notifications and lists to be a furnished to the British Consul. No further negotiation between the Consuls is at present necessary in these circumstances. s(T India Office, 2nd August 1906• Received on 20th August 1906 with Political Secretary letter No.31 dated 3rd August 1906. Sir, In continuation of my letter of the 15th July relative to the Muscat Arbitration Award, I am directed to submit, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the following observations on Sir E. Gorst's letter of the 27th June, with reference to the views expressed in Major Cox»s letter of the 26th June and in the viceroy's telegrams of the 10th and 26th July. 2. After careful consideration of the views of Major cox and the Government of India, and recognising in principle the force of their criticisms, Mr. Morley is at the same time satisfied that it is expedient to accept Sir 3D. Grey's suggestion (1) that M. Laronce's list should be accepted without further question; and (2) that, in spite of the terms of the Award, the papers of any dhow named in the list which may pass out of its present owners possession while he remains entitled to fly the French flag may be transferred to another dhow belonging to the same owner, provided that the total number of dhows named in the list can in no case be increased , s.7 S. Although these concessions may not be agreeable to His Highness the Sultan, It is understood that the dhow owners mentioned in the list have no power of transferring their personal rights in respect of dhows owned either wholly or in part by themselves to any one else whether by devolution or otherwise. I am to call attention to this understanding beacuse the remarks of His Majesty's Consul at Muscat on the list presented to him by the French Consul indicate that the listed dhow owner possess^ only a share in some of the listed dhows, and it is presumes that the death of the listed dhow owner will extinguish the rights which^is partners, if any, may have derived from him during his lifeztime under his authority to fly the French flag. 4. Mr. Morley would, however, commend to Sir E. Grey^ favourable consideration the suggestions of the Government of India that, when the transfer of a flag from one dhow to another belonging to the same owner is authorised, the French Consul should be required to notify the fact irmiediately to the Sultan, and similarly to furnish an annual list of flag -holders and their dhows. The French Government might also be asked to instruct their Consul to inform British colleague, as a matter of courtesy, of the notifications made to the Sultan on the subject. This procedure will go far to prevent anyi A - r pas1 88 any revival of the misunderstandings which in the past have tended to disturb the situation at Muscat. 5, Article^of the Pro jet de raises the question of jurisdiction in the case of offences committed on the high seas and in Muscat territorial waters. The question was discussed in Sir E. OorsVs letter of Pth February 1906, and it seems desirable that the views of His Majesty's Government as expressed in that letter ■»* should now be stated to the French Government. 6. It may be well in conclusion to advert to the case of the six dhow owners in Zanzibar, referred to in my letter of the 14th February last, who were claim^as French Proteges under the Agreement of 13th May 1904. In view of the proposals which are made in this letter Mr. Morley would leave it to Sir E. Grey to decide whether the decision arrived at in Sir E. Gorst's letter of the 27th February last might not now be modified, and the owners of these dhows placed in the same position as the Muscati dhow owners. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.

August 13, 1906. No. 26491. Foreign Office to India Office, Sir, I am dir^cterl hj Secretary Sir E. Grey to state for the information of the Secretary of State for India that he has carefully considered your letter of the 2nd instant together with the papers previously communicated by you on the 13th, 24th and 26th ultimo in regard to the Muscat Arbitration Award. Sir E. Grey fully concurs in Mr. Morley's view that in principle there is much force in the observations of the Government of India and Major Cox as to the doubtful nature of the Erench claims and the difficulty of pressing the Sultan to accept the list of dhow-owners supplied by Mons. Laronce. He consi ders, however, that when Major Cox contends, as appears from his letter of June 2Hth that unless the French list is reduced, IBs Majesty's Government will practically sacrifica the results of the arbitration, he los^s si^ht of the two principal advantages which have been securod by the Award. These advan tages are firstly that with tlie death of the present flagholders no more dhows privileged to fly the French flag will remain when the controversy will auto matically cease, and secondly that the flagholders directly they land in Oman will come under the Sultan's jurisdiction. Sir E Grey is therefore glad to note that Mr, Morley concurs in the suggestions put forward in the letter fr^m this Office No. 20053 of June 27th with a view of settling this long pending controversy with the French Govern ment. The decisions which have been agreed upon are embodied in the Memoran dum, of which a draft is enclosed, and Sir E. Grey proposes, if Mr. Morley concurs, to communicate this documen 1 '. to the French Ambassador. It will be seen from the accomp anying copy of a Note which has recently been received from Mons. Cambonthat the French Government are manifest ing some impatience at the de^ay in the settlement of this question. Sir E. Grey does not consider that this complaint is in any way justified, and he will point out to Mons Caml on in reply that before arriving at a deci sion it was necessary for His Majesty Government to consult the Govern ment of India and to give full consideration to tiieir views. In communicating to the French Embassy the Memorandum above refer red to. Sir E. Grey proposes to intimate verbally that if the French Government are unable to accept the liberal concessions now offered to them. His Majesty's Government will bo compelled to obtain further evidence regarding the dhows for which French papers are claimed with a view of subjecting the list to a searching enquiry, and he will suggest that the other points in dispute should be referred for final decision to Mons.

Monsieur le Secretaire d'Etat, Selon le desir exprim^ par votre Excellence, le Consul de France h. Mas- oate a ^te charge par le Gouvernement de la Republique de s'entendre avec son collogue britannique au sujet de Tapplication de la sentence arbitrale du 8 aout 1905. Ues conferences ont eu lieu a ce sujet au mois de dccembre dernier entre Mons. Laronce et le Major Grey. A la suite de ces pourparlers, I'agent fran9ais a remis au Consul d'Angleterre, le 4 mars dernier, la liste des boutriers que le Gouvernement dela Republique consid6re comms ayintle droit d'arborer le pavilion fratals; le 20 avril, il lui a communique egalement un projet64 Article o. —La juridiction du Saltan sera applicable dans TOman a tons les proprietaires de boutres battant pavilion Franyais, ainsi qu'aux oapiraines et aux membres de Vequipage ; toutefois pear les crimes et les delits ou contes- i-itions, ayant eu lieu a bord en haute mer ou dans les eaux territoriales de I'Oraan, et en general partout ou le droit d'inviolabilite est reserve, la rornpe- tence restera au Consul de France, ou a defaut a son representant, ou aux ofli- ciers de l i Marine Nationale. Si le crime ou deiit est etabli, le coupable sera remis au Sultan. Article 6. —Les dispositions du present E^glempnt, apres approbation des Gouvernernents Frmeals et Anglais, seront communiquees, ainsi que le teste dela sentence, par voie d'affiches, aux sujetstlu Sulttn. His Majesty's Government note with satisfaction the friendly and concilia tory manner in which the two Consuls have carried on their negotiations, they are, however, unable to admit that Mons, Laronce's attitude and proposals are in accordance with either the spirit or the letter of the recent Award. Mons. Laronce apparently claims that authorisation to fly the French was given to each and every owner once for all, that is to say if once it is admitted that a particular Maskati falls within one of the categories authorised under Fart I of the Award, then, under Part II -(a) lie is entitled to fly the French flag over any and every dhow which he now possesses or may ever possess and is not limited to the dhow or dhows specifinally mentioned by name in the revised French list of March •ith, 1906, and (&amp;) that he is entitled to replace any dhow at present in his possession of which he may sub sequently become dispossessed by sale or loss, As regards (a) ITis Majesty's Government hold that if the authorisation granted to the fl igholder was originally a general one for all his dhows, then he will retain that riuht under the terms of the Award; but that if, on the other hand, the original authorisation was granted for a dhow or dhows specifi cally mentioned by name, then authorisation for the same dhow or dhows only can be claimed under the Award. It appears that Mons. Laronce, on being requested to produce a copy of the original authorisation for each dhow claimed, or to quote the date of first issue, has expressed his inability to com ply; nevertheless he cannot dispute the evidence available in the recorded specimens of ' Titres de Navigation, ' which warrants the presumption that the authorisations issued in the past have in all cases been made out for single dhows by name and not in a general form. IC Mons. Laronce s claim that the first authorisation, even though only issued for a single dliow, carries with it the risht to fly the French flag over all dhows which the owner may ever poFsess^were to'be admitted, the number of such dhows might be indefinitely increased and it would be impossible for the feultan to check the process 01 to khow at any given time how many and what dhows are sailing under the French flag, lhat it was the intention of the arbitrators to limit strictly not only the number of flagholders but also the number of dhows entitled to fly the French flag is evident from the terms of the Award, in which reference is made (Part l)§§ 1 and 3 to ' le droit d'autoriser les navires ... a arborer le pavidon franyais'' and (Part II) § 1 'les boutres ... autorises, etc. ... ^ §2 ' I'autorisation, ne peut etre transmise, etc, ou a equel que autre boutre ' and § 3 ' Boutres autorises h arborer, etc. ... In order to carry out the terms of the Award it is important that the notification which wiil be ultimately promulgated among th.3 subjects of the Sultan shall contain the names not only of the French flagholders but also of the dhows which are entitled to carry the French flag and tlis Majesty's Govern ment would not feel justified in accepting any settlement which did not provide accordingly. As regards {b) His Majesty's Government consider that the claim to replace dhows which have been lost or sold is in entire contradiction with section 2 of Part II of the Award which lays down that: L'autorisation d'arborer le porillon Frangais ne peut 4tre transmise ou transferee h quelque autre personne ou a quelque autre boutre (dhow) m6me si celui^ci appartenait au meinc propi let are.'65 The list of French flagholders comnnmicated by Mons. Larotice on March 4th, 1906, contains the n^mes of twenty dhow-owners and of forty-five dhows His Majesty's Consul reports that as the result of careful enquiry, he has evidence to' prove that certain of the dhow-owners are not entitled to the authorisation and that many of the dhows are not the property of the persons against whose nemes they have been entered. Ho considers that the Sultan would be legitimately aggrieved if he were called upon to recognise claims of the very doubtful character of which he is fully aware, and that the list should properly be reduced to fourteen owners and eighteen dhows. This serious divergence of opinion with his trench colleague would appear to call for a searching investigation into the evidence for and against the claims advanced. Nevertheless, His Majesty's Government, animated by feelings of sincere goodwill towards the French Government, desire to settle this question rather in a spirit of friendly concession than in accordance with a strict interpreta- t on of the terms of the Award. Accordingly they are prepared to accept the list of flagholders and dhows communicated by Mons. Laronce on March 4tli last subject to the following conditions :— 1. That the French Government are satisfied as to hona fide nature of the claims advanced in regard to which Mons. Laronce might be invited to consult the evidence collected by his British colleague with a view to further revision. 2 That it is clearlv understood that the dhow-owners mentioned in the list have no power of transferring itheir Heir right which i,per*onai to U em '[ ve '* to personal rilrhts owned either wholly or ft, the French flag on dhoxes owned either wholly or ^ i* pan h V themselves to in part by themselves or) any one else (ste letter to Foreign office, 20th August.) whether by. devolution or otherwise, and that the death of any owner on the list will extinguish the rights which his partnerts, if any, may have derived from him during his lifetime under his authority to fly the French flag. 3. That the list of dhow-owners! and dhows when finally settled should under no circumstances be modified. But as a further concession His Majesty's Government are ready to admit that, in spite of the terras of the Award, the papers of any dhow named in the list which mav pass out, of its present owner's possession while lie remains entitled to fly the French flag may be transferred to another dhow belonging to the same owner, provided that the total number of dhows named m the list [can in no case be increased. They consider that when the transfer of a flag fron one dhow to another is authorised, the French Consul at Muscat should be required to notify the fact immediately to the Sultan and similarly to 1 urn is h to His Hisrhness an annual list of flag hoTdi^ ^rWo^r -The^uld further Vsoi^^esrlorThe iavonrable consideration of tlic French Goverument, that Mons. j Laronce should be instructed to inform his British colleague, as a matter oi courtesy, of the notifications made to the Sultan on Ihe subject. There remains a further question in regard to the six dhow owners in Zanzibar whom Mons. Laronce claims as French proteges under the Agreement of May 13th, 1904. It appears according to the information in possession of His Majesty's Government that four of these men are in reality subjects of the Sultan of Muscat and therefore not entitled to French protection under the terms of the Award. His Majesty's Government are however not disposed to press for any further investigations in regard to tbe validity of this elaitn and they are willing to admit that the Arabs in question may he placed in the same posi tion as the other dhow-owners on the French Consul's list. It is hoped that the French Government will appreciate the liberal nature of the concessions now proposed. As regards the point raised in Article IV of Mons. Laronce's Projet de EeglementTrelative to the French claim to juris liction in Muscat over anOmani accused of having committed a crime on the high seas while sailing in a dhow flying the French flag, His Majesty's Government are of opinion that if the Omani in question leaves the ship and proceeds on shore, he comes at once under the jurisdiction of the Sultan and is not justiciable by the French Consul. On the other hand the Saltan has no valid ground of complaint if , without being landed, the man is transhipped for trial at Obokh or some other place within French territory, nor would it be reasonable for His Highness to object if the man were merely landed so as to enable the French Consul to make arrangements for his being sent for trial before a Court in French territory. It is suggested that clauses should be added to the proposed Notification to the effect that any infringement by any of the subjects of the Sultan of the arrangement now arrived at would be severely punished, and further that any flagholders, who may desire to surrender their French papers, will be permitted to do so. His Majesty's Government sincerely hope that in view of the considerable concessions to which they are prepared to consent, an arrangement on the above lines will prove acceptable to the French Government. Should it however be found impossible to arrive at an understanding in the matter, they must reserve their full right to continue the discussion in the light of a strict interpretation of the Arbitration Award. {Received on 10th September 1906, with Political Secretary's letter No, 34, dated 24th August 1906.)

I havcthe honour to solicit reference to the printed papers marginally noted, Foreign Office to the India Office, No. 26494 of which were forwarded to me for informa- ,3 |Iidt. U officr.VK'r°'g„ &lt;! 'bffic^ dated th. 20 th tion Foreign Department Endorse- August. ment No. 3843-E. B., dated 26th Septem ber. In his letter No. 26494, dated August 13th above cited. Sir Eldon Gorst mentions that His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs held that in expressing certain views in my letter of 26th June to the Government of India, I was losing sight of the two principal advantages of the Aw^rd. When considering my communication, I think the Government of India had sufficient on their record to satisfy them that such was hardly the case, but as His Majesty's Secretary of State may not have been cognisant of views previ ously expressed by me, I venture to furnish the following explanatory details of the grounds on which my observations under reference were based. They were (a) The weak character of the pr(sent Sultan of Maskat when left to his own devices and the consequent apprehension which I entertain that the owners and crews, (with their families) of so many dhows associated with the French Flag, will, in spite of their documentary abandonment to the Sultan's jurisdiction, form a sufficiently potent element in Soor to leaven the whole community and encourage them to continue, as heretofore, to defy the irresolute Government of His Highness the Sultan. I admit that the latter's weakness is no fault of ours or of the French, but it is a factor which affects our own interests and cannot be locally ignored. In this connection I venture to attach, for con-venient reference, a copy of my letter No. 454. of 17th September 1905, where this question is more fully dealt with and my views generally on the terms of the Award are expressed. {b) That whereas the material for controversy will admittedly cease to exist automatically with the death of the present flag-holders ; neverthe less the latter are an able-bodied and long-lived class, and it is to be feared that the number of Maskat Dhows claiming the protection of the tricolour will not appreciably diminish during the lifetime of His Highness Sir Seyyid Feisal. 3. I notice that in his communication of 31st July to His Majesty's Secre tary of State, Monsieur Cambon is pleased, and by no means for the first time, to make unfriendly allusion to the connection of the representatives of the Govern ment of India, including my humble self, with the negoclations. Throughout our dealings with the French Government of the last 7 or 8 years the credit or discredit of the Government of India's respresentatives con cerned has been the care of His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and, with reference to the penultimate paragraph of Sir E. Gorst's letter, I venture respectfully to express the hope that the French Ambassador's some what uncalled for observations were not allowed to pass without comment. I disclaim for myself, as well as for other local officers with whom I have the honour to serve, any other feeling than the desire to see the Sultan's interests C348FD3 and our own derive as much advantage as possible from a hard-won Award, and to assure myself that His Majesty's Government while considering the record, are at the same time as fully informed as possible as to the local aspect and applica tion of such features of the case as have been the subject of discussion between themselves and the French Government. I shall esteem it a favour if the Government of India are pleased to place the foregoing explanatory observations, together with a copy of the letter enclosed, before His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. No. 454, dated Bushire, the 17th (received 26th) September 1905. From—M ajor P. z. Cox, C .I .E., Offg Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. M F raser, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In Foreign Department telegram No 3118-E. B., dated 14th August, I was directed to submit my views with regard to the Maskat Arbitration Award after consultation with the Political Agent, Maskat. In myf telegram of 24th August, I asked permission to delay my final reply pending receipt of the printed copies of the complete proceedings and their accom panying despatches. These documents have now reached me under Foreign Department endorse ments marginally noted, and I have the honour to submit my views as directed. Meanwhile, the Government of India have received Major Grey's letters Nos. 407 and 410 and copies of the memoranda of his views and their accompaniments which he subsequently forwarded to me. 2. The full text of the preamble to the actual terms of the Award presents the latter in a much more favourable light than did the first telegraphic summa ries and at all events places it beyond doubt that the Sultan's position is consi derably benefited by the result of the Arbitration ; and that neither His Highness, nor we have any reason to regret having committed the issue to the Tribunal. Apart from the last item of the Award, which is of course most important, there are three points in the preamble to the Award which seem to me especially satisfactory— (1) That the Court have decided that France is bound, in the grant of her Flag, by the provisions of the Brussels Act, especially Article 32. (2) That they have decided that it is undeniable that the practice pursued by the French facilitates traffic in slaves. (3) That they have given the French Government a very strong hint that they are morally unjustified in persisting in their reservation of Article 42 of the Brussels Act. q. Were the present Ruler a stronger character and his administration more effective and civilised, and could we hope with any confidence that French Consuls and the French Colonial Party would be proof against temptation to cir cumvent them, then the terms of the Award would be all that we could reason ably want, and'the privilege of inviolability in Maskat waters with which the pro tected vessels have been endowed, would have been a consideration of minor im portance. As things are, however, the decision of the Tribunal on this point will, I be lieve affect the results a good deal, and what past experience teaches me to fear is that as long as there are ten or dozen flag-holders who can sail into MaskatHarbour, or cut defiantly across the bows of the ' Nur-ul-Babr ' at sea, under the French Flag, they will still ignore the Sultan, at Maskat, and will form a dis turbing leaven among the population at Sur. His Highness Seyyid Feisal is so prone to let things drift for the sake of a quiet life, that unless we are constantly vigilant in helping him to maintain his authority and improve his administration at Sur, it is possible that he may, in spite of the terms of the Award, continue to allow the French Mag element to defy his local representatives and defraud him of his Customs revenues, sooner than have unpleasant half-hours with Consuls or Naval Commanders of the French Government. It remains to be seen what steps we can devise to prevent such a contingency. 4. A great deal of course depends on the number of proteges who survive the investigation of their claims to protection. In this connection Mr, Ronald Graham estimates 10 or 12. Major Grey thinks only 2, but judging from the list of names and approximate dates which he furnishes, there will be a good many more than thai, who have received papers between 1863 and 1892. This can only be ascertained by thorough investigation, and the dates cannot be stated authoritatively pending Monsieur Laronce's return. 5. Then there are two points which I think might have been settled more explicitly in the Award. ( a ) As to whether there is any inheritable right to carry the flag. (I gather from the terms of lines 9 and 10 from the bottom of page 6 of the Award that there is not). (^) As to the manner in which the claims are to be investigated. Definite instructions on the latter point would have eliminated a fruitful source of difficulty. Thus, clause 3 of the first part of the Actual Award provides that the title to fly the Flag is conditional on the applicant being able to establish that he had been treated as a proteg^ before 1863,— But establish before whom ? 6. Lastly, with regard to measures to be taken to make the Award effec tive— (0) Major Grey writes that the Sultan is averse to the issue of a procla mation at Sur ; but I think this hesitation is only due to the fact that the Sultan had not then seen the complete Award and did not fully understand it. I quite agree, however, that any notification would be premature until the titles of all the claimants have been investigated and decided. Once that is done, I am of opinion that the issue of a written notification explaining the Award is indispensable, and that it should not be left to the ignorant mercies of the Wali of Sur, a very humble person at present. If this course is not taken, the French Dragoman will be in a position to misrepresent the terms of the Award to the Suris to any extent, and keep alive their disaffection. What I fear is that owing to Monsieur Laronce's delay, all the French Dhows and their sea-going owners will have left Sur and be absent for the next six months. If that proves to be the case, I think the broad terms of the Award should be provisionally made known forthwith, and repeated in great detail later when the claims have been verified. The notification might be issued by the Sultan in consultation with and ' with the concurrence of ' the Consuls of England andI 4 France and should specify the names of those persons entitled and ^ those not entitled to fly the Flag on their Dhows. It should also contain the threat suggested by Major Grey that the use of the Flag by unauthorised persons or Dhows would be punished with the utmost rigour, (3) On Monsieur Laronce's return he will no doubt enter into communica tion with the Sultan or Major Grey. (i) The first thing to be done is to see how many persons on the list the French are prepared to eliminate forthwith. The titles of the remainder should then be thoroughly investigated, and any case with regard to which the Consuls and the Sultan cannot come to an agreement, should be referred to London and Paris. (») Next, a draft notification for the Sultan to issue should be drawn up^ and approved by both Governments. It should in clude a fist of approved proteges. {Hi) Any doubtful points coming to light during the above negoci- ations, such as the question of inheritable title, should be re ferred to London and Paris and authoritatively settled. (w) It is presumed that any person found flying the French Flag unlawfully or running contraband under it, will be punished by the Sultan, if caught in Maskat waters. 7. I have the honour to offer two suggestions for the consideration or re consideration of Government. (j) That it should be decided between us that the creek which divides the two settlements of Sur, and which at high-water makes the Mugraimatein half almost an island, is within the territorial limits of Sur Town, and the French Flag shall not be flown there. If this is not done, cases of so-called violation of the flag during the tribal quarrels of the inhabitants will be likely to recur. (nj That when we see what the result of the Award amounts to, after set tlement of titles and points of dispute, the question of the des patch of a Vice-Consul or Consular Agent to Sur after a con venient interval should again b- taken into consideration, with a view to keeping the Sultan up to asserting his position there and realising his revenue. The presence of an intelligent officer would, I believe., materially conduce to the spread of civilising influence and to the reduction of the Sur community to order. His pre sence would at the same time encourage French Consuls to adhere to the terms of the Award and prevent flag-holders from assuming any unauthorised privileges on land. G*C.

Sir, Foreign Office, August 22, 1906. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the note which M. Cambon was good enough to address to me on the 31st ultimo on the subject of the Arbitral Aw^ard pronounced last year at The Hague in regard to the dhows flying the French flag at Muscat. I regret that the French Government should consider that undue delay has taken ' place in arriving at an agreement as to the steps to be taken for carrying out the decision of the Tribunal. His Majesty's Government entirely share the view of the French Government that this matter should be arranged as speedily as possible, and it has been their desire throughout to treat the subject in the most friendly spirit. The discussions which have taken place between the French Consul at Muscat and his British colleague have, however, unfortunately shown that considerable divergence of opinion exists between these two officers, and His Majesty's Government have been obliged to carefully examine the question in consultation with the Government of India and to give full consideration to their views. In these circumstances it was inevitable that some time should elapse before His Majesty's Government were in a position to pronounce a definite decision. I have now the honour to inclose a Memorandum dealing with the points of difference which have arisen, and proposing a settlement which I trust the French Government will accept as a friendly and conciliatory solution of the question. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) EDWARD GREY. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. WITH reference to the communication made by the French Ambassador on the 22nd June last, His Majesty's Government have had under their consideration the reports from His Majesty's Consul at Muscat of his negotiations with his French colleague in regard to the application of the Muscat dhows Arbitration Aw 7 ard of August last. It would appear that Major Grey and M. Laronce have agreed that the result of the Arbitration should be notified by the Sultan to his subjects by means of a Proclamation to be issued by His Highness, but that they are unable to come to an agreement as to the list of persons who are to be entitled to fly the French flag according to the terms of the Award. The following ' projet de Reglement ' for the settlement of these questions w^as communicated by M. Laronce to Major Grey on the 20th April last:— &lt;£ Article l er . Les sujets du Sultan qui sont autorises a I'avenir a arborer le pavilion Francais sur leurs navires jouissent dans TOman du meme traitement et des memes droits que tous les autres sujets de Sa Hautesse. ' Art. 2. En principe, les personnes autorisees a arborer le pavilion Fran^ais sur leurs navires sont celles dont la liste a tSt^ dressee par le Consulat de France h Mascate, et remise an Consulat d'Angleterre le 4 Mars, 1906, h moins de modifications pouvant resulter du dec^s de ces personnes ou du retrait par la France de I'autorisation. Art. 3. Les proprietaires de bout res battant pavilion Frai^ais pourront en toute liberte vendre leurs navires, ou en acheter d'autres sans que leur droit au pavilion Fran^ais puisse etre contests. [2133 y-l]'Art. 4. Les boutriers qui out le droit d'arborer le pavilion Frangais ne pourront transmettre ce droit ^ leurs h^ritiers, descendants, ou collatdraux ; les bout res dont eeux-ci obtiendraient ainsi la possession arboreront le pavilion dn Sultan. 'Art. 5. La juridiction du Sultan sera applicable dans TOman a tons les pro- pridtaires de boutres battant pavilion Francais, ainsi qu'aux capitaines et aux membres de 1'dquipage ; toutefois, pour les crimes et les ddlits ou contestations, ayant eu lieu a bord en haute mer ou dans les eaux territoriales de I'Oman, et en g^n^ral partout oil le droit d'inviolability est rdserv^, la competence restera au Consul de France, ou h, ddfnut h, son representant, ou aux officiers de la Marine Nationale. Si le crime ou ddlit est (jtabli, le coupable sera remis au Sultan. ' Art. 6. Les dispositions du present R&amp;glement, apr^s approbation des Gouverne- ments Francais et Anglais, seront communiqudes, ainsi que le texte de la sentence, par voie d'afficlies, aux sujets du Sultan.' His Majesty's Government note with satisfaction the friendly and conciliatory manner in which the two Consuls have carried on their negotiations, they are, however, unable to admit that M. Laronce's attitude and proposals are in accordance with either the spirit, or the letter of the recent Award. M. Laronce apparently claims that authorization to fly the French flag was given to each and every owner once for all—that is to say, if once it is admitted that a particular Muscati falls within one of the categories authorized under Part I of the Award, then, under Part II— (a.) He is entitled to fly the French flag over any and every dhow which he now possesses, or may ever possess, and is not limited to the dhow or dhows specifically mentioned by name in the revised French list of the 4th March, 1906 ; and {b) That he is entitled to replace any dhow at present in his possession of which he may subsequently become dispossessed by sale or loss. As regards (a), His Majesty's Government hold that if the authorization granted to the flagholder was originally a general one for all his dhows, then he will retain that right under the terms of the Award; but that if, on the other hand, the original authorization was granted for a dhow or dhows specifically mentioned by name, then authorization for the same dhow or dhow r s only can be claimed under the Award. It appears that M. Laronce, on being requested to produce a copy of the original authorization for each dhow claimed or to quote the date of first issue, has expressed his inability to comply. Nevertheless, he cannot dispute the evidence available in the recorded specimens of ' titres de navigation,' which warrants the presumption that the authorizations issued in the past have in all cases been made out for single dhows by name and not in a general form. If M. Laronce s claim, that the first authorization, even though only issued for a single dhow, carries with it the right to fly the Frendh flag over all dhows which the owner may ever possess, were to be admitted, the number of such dhows might be indefinitely increased, and it would be impossible for the Sultan to check the process, or to know at any given time how many and what dhows are sailing under the French flag. That it was the intention of the arbitrators to limit strictly not only the number of flagholders, but also the number of dhows entitled to fly the French flag, is evident from the terms of the Award, in which reference is made, Part I, sections 1 and 3, to ' le droit d'autoriser les navires . • • • a arborer le pavilion Fran^ais,' and Part II, section 1, 'les boutres . . . autorises, &amp;c. . . . ' Section 2, ' Tautorisation ne pent etre transmise, &amp;c. . . . ou a quelque autre boutre,' and section 3, 'Boutres autorisds h arborer,' &amp;c. . . . In order to carry out the terms of the Award it is important that the notifica tion which will be ultimately promulgated among the subjects of the Sultan shall contain the names not only of the French flagholders, but also of the dhows which are entitled to carry the French flag, and His Majesty's Government would not feel justified in accepting any settlement which did not provide accordingly. As regards (6), His Majesty's Government consider that the claim to replace dhows which have been lost or sold is in entire contradiction with section 2 of Part II of the Award, which lays down that ' Tautorisation d'arborer le pavilion Francais ne *peut etre transmise ou transfdrde h. quelque autre personne ou a quelque autre boutre (' dhow '), meme si celui-ci appartenait au meme propridtaire.' The list of French flagholders communicated by M. Laronce on the 4th March, 1906, contains the names of twenty dhow-owners and of forty-five dhows. His Majesty's Consul reports that, as the result of careful inquiry, he has evidence to prove that certain of the dhow-owners are not entitled to the authorization, and that many of the dhows are not the property of the persons against whose names they have been.entered. He considers that the Sultan would be legitimately aggrieved if he were- called upon to recognize claims of the very doubtful character of which he is fully aware, and that the list should properly be reduced to fourteen owners and eighteen dhows. This serious divergence of opinion with his French colleague would appear to call for a searching investigation into the evidence for and against the claims advanced. Nevertheless, His Majesty's Government, animated by feelings of sincere good-will towards the French Government, desire to settle this question rather in a spirit of friendly concession than in accordance with a strict interpretation of the terms of the Award. Accordingly they are prepared to accept the list of flagholders and dhows communicated by M. Laronce on the 4th March last, subject to the following con ditions :— 1. That the French Government are satisfied as to bond fide nature of the claims advanced in regard to which M. Laronce might be invited to consult the evidence collected by his British colleague with a view to further revision. 2. That it is clearly understood that the dhow-owners mentioned in the list have no power of transferring their right, which is personal to themselves, to fly the French flag on dhows owned either wholly or in part by themselves to any one else whether by devolution or otherwise, and that the death of any owner on the list will extinguish the rights which his partners, if any, may have derived from him during his lifetime under his authority to fly the French flag. 3. That the list of dhow-owners and dhows, when finally settled should, under no circumstances, be modified. But as a further concession His Majesty's Government are ready to admit that, in spite of the terms of the Award, the papers of any dhow named in the list which may pass out of its present owner's possession while he remains entitled to fly the French flag may be transferred to another dhow belonging to the same owner, provided that the total number of dhows named in the list can in no case be increased. They consider that when the transfer of a flag from one dhow to another is authorized, the French Consul at Muscat should be required to notify the fact immediately to the Sultan, and similarly to furnish to His Highness an annual list of flagholders and their dhows. They would further suggest, for the favourable consideration of the French Government, that M. Laronce should be instructed to inform his British colleague, as a matter of courtesy, of the notifications made to the Saltan on the subject. There remains a further question in regard to the six dhow-owners in Zanzibar whom M. Laronce claims as French proteges under the Agreement of the 13th May, 1904 - It appears, according to the information in possession of His Majesty's Government, that four of these men are in reality subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and therefore not entitled to French protection under the terms of the Award. His Majesty's Government are, however, not disposed to press for any further investigation in regard to the validity of this claim, and they are willing to admit that the Arabs in question may be placed in the same position as the other dhow-owners on the French Consul's list. It is hoped that the French Government will appreciate the liberal nature of the concessions now proposed. As regards the point raised in Article 4 of M. Laronce's ' projet de Il^glement, ,, relative to the French claim to jurisdiction in Muscat over an Omani accused of having committed a crime on the high seas while sailing in a dhow flying the French flag. His Majesty's Government are of opinion that if the Omani in question leaves the ship and proceeds on shore he comes at once under the jurisdiction of the Sultan and is not justiciable by the French Consul. On the other hand, the Sultan has no valid ground of complaint if, without being landed, the man is transhipped for trial at Obokh, or some other place within French territory; nor would it be reasonable for His Highness to object if the man were merely landed so as to enable the French Consul to make arrangements for his being sent for trial before a Court in French territory. It is suggested that clauses should be added to the proposed Notification to the effect that any infringement by any of the subjects of the Sultan of the arrangement now arrived at would be severely punished, and further, that any flag-holders who may desire to surrender their French papers will be permitted to do so.0 His Majesty's Government sincerely hope that, in view of the considerable con cessions to which they are prepared to consent, an arrangement on the above lines wilt prove acceptable to the French Government. Should it, however, be found impossible to arrive at an understanding in the matter, they must reserve their full right to continue the discussion in the li^ht of a strict interpretation of the Arbitration Award.

(Jrei to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the ZbrA ultimo, containing observations on the French Henoranduia of November 5th in regard to the questions which huve still to he settled in connection with the Arbitral ^.v /ard of the Hague Tribunal respecting dhows flying the French flag in iluscat. Sir £. Grey understands that lir. Secretary Morley does not consider it of essential importance to resist the French reservations as to ; (1) The finality of Mens. Laronce f 8 opinion after a fresh examination of the list of dhows and flagholders. (£) The jursidiction of the French Consul over crimes committed 'b^ an Omani on the high seas i hile sailing inju dhov; flj'ing the French flag- and f3) The status of the six Zanaibari dhow-o^ners. In this view Sir E. Gr^y entirely concurs. The French claim that Omanis in the service of French I residents in Uuscat are entitled under the Treaty of 18^4 to the grant of the Trench flag is now put forward for the first time131 LV and It v/ould 'be iraposBible to that tiie acceptance of this contention v;ithout reserve might result in the rerretuation of a list of French i flagholders which would deprive the Arbitral Award of its finality She possibility of successful^ x contest- in^; the French clain is, however, open to doubt. The question seems really to turn upon the exact meaning to be assigned to the words 'Tersonnes vui tout bona fide au service des Francais', which occur in the penultimate recital in the Award to the answers to the second question submitted to the Tribunal, 2ir (Jrey does not consider, as suggested in ^our that these words could be held to include persons who can only be colourably represented as bcin^ In the service of a French resident, but it would be difficult to contend that the^ are not sufficiently wide to justify the ^rant of a French fia^ to persons who are admittedly in the bona fide service of Frenchmen. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey v/ould be ^lad to learn whether Mr. Morley considers that the point should be pressed, and if so, whether he can sr^est the wording of a reservation which iill mi 6 ht be attached to the acceptance of the French claim by E.ii. Government. Sir Grey considers that it would certainly be desirable, if possible, to avoid the delay whioh would be involved inTelegram. To foreign Calcutta. 'o; 70 dated r&gt;-Dh ^'ebruary 1^07.

V .e notejthat Hifi Majesty's Government have decided not to resist French reservations as to (i) finality of M # Laronce's opinion, (ii) Jurisdiction over crimes on high seas# With regard to point (iii) statue of six Sanzibari dhow owners, we would refer to Major Cox's letter So* 1367-B» # dated £6th June 1906, and would only add that the grant to these men when in Oman of right to full French protection would be very prejudicial to Sultan's local interests as well as to our own # They were only entered as proteges a year after agreement to refer to Hague Tribunal.. In our opinion the point 8hould 9 if possible v not be yielded without suitable n ^uid pro quo n such as mutual recognition- of 3ur Creek as an inland lagoon where protection of French flag will not penetrate. TVith regard to Omanis in French service i we would sugggest that, in order to avoid raising the question of precise nature of rights conferred by Article IY of Franco-Maskat Treaty of 1644 9 the French Government should be given an assurance that those rights, whatever they may be, are not affected by the proposeda 4U proposed arrangements. It mlgjit be pointed out thft under Artiole XIV of the Maskat Treaty 1891, the British Government possess precisely similer powers and that the present Rrrangemer.t will certainly not affect those powers, Se regard it as very doubtful whether the Article in either Treaty aen legally be interpreted as conferring on Omanis in-service of British or French the right to fly the national flag of their employers, but the point will doubtless be decided by the Lav/ Officers of the Crown. If it is decided in the affirmative, and if French insist on reserraticn, we can only suggest that i-is Majesty'e I % Government should make a oottnter-reservation to the effeot that they regard the priTilege as limited to reoognieed ealaried servants ot the French and for suoh period as they are actually in French service. Lists of sucft persons should, if possible, he furnished to the Sultan and exchanged annually with us. Major Cox oheerves that Artiole IV of the jrench Treaty has never been thus taken advantage of in the past and that it would he most inconvenient to introduce suggested practice in the Gulf. --------A OFFICE NOTE. &lt;v Confidential / 4^- (fS) The^ 7 ^ Februrry 1907.

Sir, f I have t,he honour t,o report, an occurrence of some interest, which has just, come t,o my knowledge in connection with the question of the French flag in Oman, and also of t,he arms •oraffic at, Muscat,. 2.- Ten months ago while I was on leave in India an emissary of the Somaliland Mulla is said to have arrived in Muscat, with Rs.15,000 to buy arms. The arms having been •&gt;v purchased were conveyed to Sur, and from thece under French a flag to Somaliland in the 'Khadhra' a dhow shewn in M. Laronce's list of March 4th 1906 as belonging t/O owner No. 17, Mohammed ✓ ben Selim cued Aboud, but, which is in reality owned by one Nasir bin Khamis bin Salim A1 Ghailani of Sur. The arms were safely delivered to the Mulla's agent,s, but the dhow was subsequently captured in consequence of information given against her by an Italian Consul and brought to Jibuti1 where she is still detained. 2.- The owner and crew have arrived in Oman, and th'e story which is probably true in the main, was related to us by .s-ome of the latter.CONFIDENTIAL No. 6 -E.B, A copy of each of the foregoing coranunications is for warded to the Political Resident in the Persian Crulf, for informa tion, in continuation of endorsement from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No. 2591-E.3» # dated the 15th July 1907 2, A copy has been forwarded direct to the Political Agent S* at Ma skat.

Department, I have the honour to for ward copies of the marginally noted documents in con nection with the settlement of the French flag question in accordance with the judgment of the Hague Tribunal. 2. At my first interview with ¥, Laronce on the l.th January I shewed him a copy of the memoran dum communicated to the French Ambassador by the Secretary of StateSt.aXie for Foreign Affairs on Ci/h August 1907 and par-os of x«he French despaiiCh of Siih November 1906, remarking iihax. I had nothing x»o conceal, and x,hat. our GovernmeniiS were evidentily anxious for a seiz-olementi i»o oe arrived at. as soon as possible. As a sequel to t»his interview I received on the 20th January an aanended list of dhows and dhow owners, which, as will be seen from the correspondence, I succeeded in inducing Monsieur Laronce to reduce still further. This list as it now stands is satisfactory, particularly as one or two of the persons named therein are said to be only awaiting the publication of the necessary permission to resign their authorisation. 4.- The proclamation submitted herewith in English and Arabic is sufficieni/ly brief and contains all the information necessary to define the conditions of authorisation to fly the French flag. It has been drawn up to the satisfaction of His Highness the Sultan and the French Consul, and I trust will have the approval of the Government of India and yourself, in which ease I respectfully request the favour of being supplied with 100 printed copies of the Arabic version for circulation in Oman. Monsieur Laronce and I do not consider it necessary that the proclamation should be countersigned by us. 5.- The Sultan is much pleased with the settlement arrived at, and regards with satisfaction the prospect of a cessation of the worry and annoyance which he has experienced in the past in connection with this question. 6.- These final negociations and the preparation of the necessary documents have oeen somewhat delayed by my having been indisposed. 7.- Copies of this letter and its enclosures have been forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign Department and, in accordance with the instructions contained in the telegram from the'Government of India in the Foreign Department of the 29th November 1905, a copy of enclosure No.10 has been despatchedFrom FAISAL bin TUR^I. To all who may see it/.. Whereas in i/ime pasti difficult/ies had arisen in my dominions on accouni. of T.he issue of papers by t/he French Govern ment iiO certain of my subjects authorising them to fly the French flag on their dhows, I had requested the English Government to regulate and settle the matter with that of the French. The two Governments referred the general question to the Court of Arbitration at the Hague, and the judgment of that Court was as foilows : - !•- Before the 1st Januarys 1S92 France was entitled to authorise vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules; 2.- Owners of dhows who before 1S92 have been authorised by France to fly the French flag, retain this authorisation as long as France renews it to the grantee; Alter Snd January 1B&amp;2, France was not entitled to authorise vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters out had established or should establish that they had been considered and treated by- France as her 'proteges'- before the year 1~GZ; ;&gt;hows of Muscat authorised as aforesaid to fly the trench flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Muscat to* (S).
