The Managing Director, LaiiXK. intercepted a message quoting an Independent Oil Cccip&amp;ry whioh waa apparently negotiating with tlie Sheikh of Kuwait for an oil oondession in the Keulral Zone, south of the territory of Comi&gt;any gave me only very scanty information as this proposed new oil company was not associated with the usual two major oil groups, I therefore pursued this matter during cy recent visit to Kuwait as new oil exploration parties in an area devoid of port facilities etc, would obviously require comnunications from the conmenoement of their operations. The Independent Oil Company formed in July 1947 with an authorised capital of 100,000,000 dollars to operate in this new area is entirely American consisting of the following ten m ' ^ x a •&gt; 4 - * w ^ ✓ v»‘ independent American Cil Companies:- 1, Phillips Petroleum Comi&gt;any, .:r: n 2, Signal oil and Gas Company. 3* Sunray Oil Oorpcration. 4* Hancock Oil Company. 5* Globe Oil and Refinipg COLpany, 6, Deoprock Oil Ccwpany, 7.

(independent Oil has been fanned far the purposes of developing oil resources in the Middle jSast) • These Gotupanies have cocJbined assets of over 75^,000,0( 0 dollars. Their annual volume of business exceeds 500,000,000 # dollars and their earnings per year approximate /]) ,000,000 dollars. These Companies are cctnbiied in support of American Independent Oil Company as joint undertaking not only as to financiers but as to operators and resources as well. Their tiigb coupe to noe and business success is well established in the United States. President of the Coqpany is R*K*Davies, well known as operating head of the Petroleuia Administration, United States Federal Government throughout the war with extensive experience in large scale oil operations, domestic and foreign. I have known of the competition for this concession since early 19i+i&gt; when I net the Chairman of the Iraq Petroleum Company at Kuwait at that time. In the case of the .American Company, the initial offer to the Sheikh of Kuwait was 4,250,000 dollars purely for a concession to explore the area. This was subsequently increased to a sum^ of 8,000,000 dollars guaranteed cash payment which the Sheikh of Kuwait accepted. Concession was signed on the 28th June, 19^S* Although tte terms of the Concession have not been published, I am given to understand on very good authority that these are as follows: - • ' - . .V... '• - • — 1. An initial payment to the Sheikh of Kuwait of 8,000,000 dollars in'cash. 2. An annual payment of 625,000 dollars each year until, oil is discovered and produced. /3(3) S’ 3* &lt;!hon oil is produced the :^ho3idi is to reooivc a royalty of 2 dollars 57 oonts par ton# I have been inf arced that clause 3 broolcs the n Gontloaen f s ;£px»tjent n entcjred into by all other Oil oocrxinies in the I.iddle Kost ^hcroby they agreed that the noxl z. royalty they nould pay •swuld be 1 dollar 25 cents per ton# For tiJLs reason it is oertain that other Oil Oaapanies look m?on the Independent Oil Company as racier underhand operators in the oil world# I was unable to ascertain the actual area of proposed operations but I think it most likely that if search is nauc in the interior an establishment of an actalnistrativc nf^ture will be set up near tlie coast wharo jort facilities will be surveyed and subsequently provided# I tore instructed our Uanagor to Imp m odvisod regarding &lt; evelopoaents such as docidod location and date of oocLienoouont# I have also instructed him to press enquiries regarding toleooopunioations which will be necessary for this Ooapany and that yjo should cuke every endeavour to provide some sort of circuit iBC&amp;diately on request as I have reason to believe that the activities of this Ca^any v.ill be oonsidarable within a short period from the ooumenaemont of tlieir exploration# Exploration parties using the ’’BefToction' and 'Hefleotion' methods are to be utilised and are now being organised in the United States# Yours faithfully, (Sgd.)

Ext. 550/48 o f the 3rd March about the auction for the concession in the huwait share of the huwait neutral i oil £one. 2m in paragraph 2 you ask me ho* long the auction is likely to last. i have replied to this question in my telegr am flo.219 of the 15th March despatched from Kuwait. The Shaikh hopes to close the auction in May and has asked all the competitors whom he recognises to send representatives to Kuwait then. it appears that he wishes, if possible, to exclude the other competitors vizi Amerada* the Sinclair interests ITwitchell) and the Superior Oil Company, from whom he has refused to accept offers pending the production of references. 3. i am told tnat the Shaikh will in due course ask the Company which makes the highest bid to produce its detail ed proposals. if they do not satisfy him he will turn to the next highest bidder. 4. Prom the local point of view the combination of companies suggested m your paragraph 5 would be ee-Hv-emantl.y satisfactory and i, feel sure it would be acceptable to the Shaikh who would welcome the prospect of a solution whicn ^ would leave as few as possible of his friends disappointed. 5. i Was sorry to learn from paragraph 6 of your letter that the economic crisis may make it necessary for the ijuimah Oil Company to withdraw from the auction. i am not in a position to argue on this subject but i would point out that it is likely to be some years before operations can start on an extensive scale in the neutral hone. negotiat ions between the successful company and the shaikh, and then between «,ne ahaikh , 3 Company and Ibn Saudis Company, and then between the two Companies, H.m.G. , ibn Saud and the Shaikh regarding political and administrative arrangements will inevitably take a long time and after that a considerable period must ue devoted to exploration and surveying before operations can start for the production of oil, if it is discovered. bo far therefore as the shortage of steel is concerned it would appear probable that the Kuwait Oil Company and also Petroleum Concessions .Limited in Qatar will have completed most of their constructional programme before steel is required for operations in the JNeutral Zone. in these circunstances 1 very much hope that it may still oe found possible to allow a British Company to compete for the Neutral Zone Concession, if not on its own, then jointly with an American Company as contanplated in paragraph 5 of your letter. 6. The report contained in my telegram ho.228 of the 12th March that it was understood that the Shaikh intended to ask for payment to be made in dollars may perhaps influence the Treasury’s attitude in this matter. The information was obtained not from the Shaikh himself but from his Secretary Abdullah Mullah who told Schooling the Manager of the Ottoman / Lank J.P.Gibson Esquire, Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, London, s.W.l.Bank at Basra that *hen a concession w a s granted the Shaikh would ask for payment to be made m dollars. Abdullah Mullah also told another bank manager that the Shaikh w a s likely to favour the American independent Oil Company owing to the large dollar payments they had offered. This may be one of the points that the Shaikh is leaving for settlement until the auction is completed c.f. paragraph 3 above and if it is considered a vital one x would suggest that Abraham might be prompted to make enquiries about it. 7. In your paragraph 7 you enquire whether any diffi culty would be likely to arise from competition for labour if two con^ames in iuiwait and the neutral £one were expanding their operations simultaneously. As I have pointed out m paragraph 5 above the Kuwait Oil Company should almost have reached the limits of their expansion before the neutral ^one Company can begin. in any case i do not think the situation would oe worse tnan it is at present wn.en there is great competition for labour in Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar and at various places on the mainland owing to the ever expanding activities of the various oil companies and the construction of the Trans Arabian pipe-line. in fact the situation may well improve as nomads who have obtained employment with the Oil Companies are showing a tendency to marry and settle near the camps and large nunoers of Arabs, Persians and Baluchis who are affected oy the rise m prices and the practical cessation of the pearl trade are migrating from the Trucial Coast, Muscat and other places to the oil-fields. 8. in your paragraph 9 you discuss the possible reper cussions in Iraq and owier countries of the greatly increased rate of production and revenue in Kuwait which will ensue if a new oil field is developed in the neutral Zone in addition to the present one. it is difficult for me to asses the nature and extent ox such repercussions which in any case are not likely to be felt for some years for reasons already stated. it would not, however, appear to be fair to either Kuwait or Saudi Arabia to slow up the development of the oil resources of une neutral Zone , if any exist, for fear of exciting the jealousy of neighbouring countries. 9. With reference to paragraph 9 of your letter, iroxitical Agent and myself have been and will be very careful not to give any advice to the Shaikh which could be inter preted by him as indicating that we expect him to favour one or other of the competing companies.Ministry of Fuel and Power, 7, Miilbank, &gt; IND2XEP London, S.W.l. 20th March, 194B n Kuwait Neutral Zone Many thanks for sending me a copy of your letter to Plett of the 18th March* As you say, the application of exchange control to Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms is indeed likely to be a peculiarly difficult problem.

F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, S.W.l.—-Mr. G-ibaftn. In October, 19U&amp; the Sheikh of koweit at last indicated his willingness to grant a concession covering his oil rights in the Koweit heutral Zone (see Ext.6973/4^). Since then there have been nutiierous entrants for the concession and the bidding has been fast and furious. Bids have been put in by the following companies:- P.C.L., Oulf Exploration^ Co,, Burmah Oil Co., American Independent Oil Co. and the American Amerada Petroleum Corporation. P.C.L. appear more or less to have dropped out and the strongest favourite in the British stable at the moment is the Burmah Oil Co. The bidding has, however, now reached such fantastic heights that the Treasury have got cold feet about the Burmah Oil Co.*3 continued participation. The draft letter below which embodies various amendments suggested by Departments concerned seeks the Political Resident's observations on the questions raised by the entry of the American^independent^Oil Cof. in the field. * . Fit C' o/cu £ ^55Q/4Q Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, SECRET Whitehall, London, S.W.1 • ^ 1948 . At a recent inter-depa.rtmental meeting v/ith the fJinisti’j’’ of Fuel and Power and the Foreign Office the position regarding bids for the petroleum rights in the K owe it Neutral ''’one was reviewed and the question whether it would be desirable to try to influence the Sheikh in favour of a particular oil company or group of companies was specially considered# was generally felt that the increase in the bidding was such that the large sums involved might soon be incommensurate with the oil prospects of the area# There may however be companies having as yet no concessions in the Middle East which may still wish to raise the stakes; and clearly H#r#G# is not in a position to influence the /merican companies in deciding hoi/ much they arc prepared to offer# 7:0 should be interested to know whether you consider it likely that the Sheikh may close the bidding at an early date or prolong the auction for an undefined period. 3« The latest definite bid of which we have information is that of the Amerada Petroleum Corporation, 'which offered an initial payment of $ million, a minimum annual payment of $ $00,000 and a royalty of 25 cents per barrel# w G have recently heard that if Amerada succeed in gaining the concession, it will be joined by the Continental Oil Company and ^ the Seaboard Oil Company, both of which have been successful in their operations in U.S.A. Vo are adviaod that Amerada, in conjunction with the other two companies, would make a strong team and have sufficient assets, knowledge and ability to make a success of developing the concession. 7/0 do not ka &lt;&gt;w whether Gulf Oil Corporation intend to advance its latest offer. However, as you are aware, it has boon mutually agreed between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Corporation that if either of them should obtain Kowoit's rights in the Neutral Zone it would share them equally with the other. For the present the A.I.Q.C. are debarred from bidding even as an equal partner with the Gulf Oil Corporation in the Loweit Oil Company# This position may alter when the Red Line Agreement is revised, negotiations regarding which are still proceeding, though it appears unlikely tliat ahy. settlement will be reached for three or four months at the earliest. 3* Ly the time j^ou receive this letter 3 r ou will no doubt have seen Abraham, who will have explained to you the Burmah Oil Company’s intention to increase its previous bid and its readiness to go up to £1,000,000# Before leaving here Abraham renairked that, if unsuccessful, he would, after his return to the U.K., probably approach Gulf with the object of endeavouring to arrange a tripartite agreement between Gulf, A.I.O.C., and B.0#C.,.with the purpose of acquiring jointly the Koweit share of the rights in the Neutral Zone# Vo have no indication whether A.I.O.C. and Gulf v/ould look favourably on this grouping of companies, which as far as we are concerned would seem quite a good arrangement. Lt. Col. Sir R. Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrein. Vo/e feel thf.t re cannot dictate to the oil companies whether or with whom tr;ey will go into partnership, although the British companies rill undoubtedly consult us before finally committing themselves to any such agreement. As regards the Burmah Oil Company I should explain that it is an important shareholder in A.I.O.C. and consequently if it were to acquire rights in the Neutral Zone it would tend to develop the area, in agreement with the Koweit Oil Co. o. I should here say in parenthesis that since our interdepartmental meeting, there has been an important development so far as the participation of the Burmah Oil Company is concerned. The Treasury have expressed the opinion that, in view of the deteriorating position Ox our balance of payments since January, 1947* and the snail amount 01 ste^l available, which, when taken with our dollar shortage, will mean that the British petroleum industry will be hard put to it to develop concessions already held, the Burmah Oil Company should be hauled off as soon as possible from further participation in the Neutral Zone ruction. Since, however, Abraham has already gone out and since the Sheikh is apparently in no hurry to dispose of his rights and it is unlikely that any final commitment will be reached in the near future, the Treasury have said that they are prepared to writ until Abraham returns hone in order to assess the position. Nothing has yet boon said to the Burmah Oil Company about this development and we should therefore prefer that you make no reference to it in any discussion with Abraham. , . ' e realise that there are likely to be some administrative difficulties if the Sheikh grants a concession to a company not connected in any way with the company already established in the vicinity. If two separate companies in Koweit and the Neutral Zone were expanding their operations simultaneously, they night be faced with a shortage of labour, and the cost of local labour and materials might rise rapidly. In their own interests, however, two computing companies would probably make arrangements to ensure that action by one of them did not seriously prejudice the position ol both, though an independent company would naturally wish to push ahead with its development in order to got quick returns on its capital. I should be grateful for your opinion whether any real difficulty of this nature would be likely to arise. No doubt the local manager of the Koweit Oil Company, or Couthwell in the course of cine of his visits, will have informed the Nheikh of his views as to the disadvantages likelj' to be suffered b 5 r his company or Koweit from the appearance on the scene of an entire^ new company. • Tnere is a further aspect of the Koweit Neutral Zone question which requires consideration. Based on the best information available, the expansion programmes for the oil fields of the different Middle East countries provide for the following increases in production:- Country 1946 125! Millions of Tons Persia. 19.2 37.0 Iraq k»7 13 .5 Saudi Arabia 8.0 •25.5 Bahrein 1.1 ' 1.2 Koweit 0.8 24 .Z{. Oatar nil 1.0 Total H ..8 102.6From these figures you will see thot the production increase for K ore it is already considerably more rapid than that in any other 1'iddlo East country. If a new oil field should bo developed, the rate of increase in Koweit production would be still greater. If this should occur we nay well expect repercussions in some of the neighbouring countries, such as Iraq, which nay express dissatisfaction with the relatively slow rate of increase in their production and the consequent loss to them of revenue from oil royalties* etc. Taking the afore mentioned 1951 production forecast* the approximate overall payments by the oil companies to the Government, at the present scale of royalties, taxes and other payments, are estimated as follbwsi- Country Millions Persia 14*5 Iraq 5.9 Saudi Arabia 10.3 Bahrein 0.35 Koweit 5.95 Qatar 0.23 Total 36.63 9. In spite of the administrative and other difficulties which we nay have to expect if an independent company obtains the concession* it is important that you should not give any advice to the Sheik which could be construed as directly or indirectly favouring the grant of the concession to the Koweit Oil Company or any other of the big established oil companies, whether Tritish or American. A certain section of public opinion is continually pressing the U.K. Government to adopt a policy favouring immediate internationalisation .of oil resources. The allegation is made that the Anglo-American Oil Agreement is designed to protect the position of the existing big oil companies and to prevent independent companies getting a footing in oil producing areas, particularly in the Middle East. It is therefore necessary to avoid any suggestion that we are pressing for the grant of the concession to any particular company unless there are over-riding considerations of great importance which would justify departure from this general policy. To should liko-wise, of course, not give advice favouring 'independent' companies. 10* w e should be glad to have your views as soon as possible on the matters mentioned above.oli'fot' A £./+a~. ■ ■nwir '5 MAR l$4j SECRET z 4 *^/^ Graft Letter from C.R. 0. to Political i _ Resident, Persian Gulf.

Before leaving here Abraham remarked that, if unsuccessful, he would, after his to the U.K., probably approach Gulf with the object of endeavouring to arrange a tripartite agreement between Gulf, A.I.O.C., and B.0.0., with the purpose of acquiring jointly the KinwAit share of the rights in the Neutral Zone. We have no indication 3 rf^bd whether A.I.O.C. and Gulf would loo.iv favourably on this grouping of companies, which as far as we are concerned would seem quite a good arrangement. In thio -connect! on itfe feel that we cannot dictate to the oil companies aa ^c&gt; whether or with whan tue y go into partnership, although the British companies will undoubtedly consult us before finally comriitting themselves to any such agreement, f' {4 —gnu wi H no doubt icalise that tt is dif P h-irl i. q. f lC discriminate between one British coirpany and another or between British and American companies. Moreover, I think we should avoid placing ourselves in \ position whereby we appear to support the major oil companies in pre»ei 4iice to a smaller conpary, since in these circumstances we would be accused\of furthering monopoly interests. Nevertheless / see no objection to our making sure that the Sheikh is aware of the administrative and operational difficulties which would arise if he should decide to grant the concession to a conpanj^ unconnected in ary way with a compary already established in the vicinity.\ I—am very doubtfulXvhether it would be wise for the Political Agent or youKo approach the Sheikh on this subject, but A feel that it would be preferable fhr this aspect to be presented to the Sheikh by the local Manager of K*0. C. \pr someone whose advice would be acceptable to the Sheikh. erhaps you o^uld arrange for such an approach to be made. (pl 7. The difficulties that I envisage relatV in particular to an acute (V /&amp; fov* k 0 a c. V ^ ^ shortage of labour that would occur in case two\separate companies/endeaVoured to expand operations simultaneously. The naturalVesult of this would be that both companies v/ould suffer and be faced with \ rapidly rising cost of is- local labour and materials and after a period of artificial prosperity tke- a slump and unenplcyraenl State would suffer from On the Vther hand, ifr 66o\w8 7. vve realise that there are like]y to be some administrative difficulties if the Sheikh grants tnae concession to a company not connected in any way with the compare already established in the vicinity. If two separate companies in Koweit and the Neutral Zone were expanding their operations simultaneously^ they might be faced with a shortage of labour^and the cost of local labour and materials might rise rapidly. In their fit. own interests, however, two competing companies would probably make arrangements to ensure that action one of them did not seriously prejudice the position of both^though an independent company would naturally wish t o push ahead with its development in order to get quick returns on its capital. I should be grateful for your opinion -wr whether 'think any real difficulty of this nature would be likely to arise. No doubt the local manager of the Koweit Oil Go.^ or Southwell in the course of one of his /visits- 3 - 3 - &lt;6&amp;olu^ IC*O.C* or the Gulf Comteny in association with B*0*C. and/or A*I*0. C* and in partnership with Arainco w^re responsible for operations in the Neutral Zone, there would obviously be a mWjh better chance of proceeding in an orderly manner and in such a way as nov. to interfere with K.O. C. *s expansion programme. An M independent” comparer might f\nd it necessary to press ahead rapidly with oil development to make quick\returns on its money. As regards the B. 0.C., rv. K I should explain that it is an important shareholder in A* 1.0. C. If it were to acquire rights in the Neutral Zone therefore feel/that it would tend to develop the area in such a manner as not to harm K«0.C. f s interests. Consequently Bunnah Oil Company's aspirations have our full support. 8. There is a further aspect of the Kpwiit Neutral Zone question which requires consideration. Based on the best information available, the expansion programmes for the oil fields of the different Middle East countries provide for the following increases in production:- Country 1946 1931 Millions of Tons Persia 19.2 37.0 Iraq k.1 13.5 Saudi Arabia 8.0 25.5 Bahrein 1.1 1.2 I^wflit 0.8 2i*4 Qatar nil 1.0 Total 33.8 102.6 Prom these figures you will see that the production increase for KjiwAit is already considerably more rapid than that in any other Middle East country. If a new oil field should be developed, the rate of increase in KawAit production would be still greater. If this should occur -I thinfe wcU&lt; that we may expect repercussions in some of the neighbouring countries, such as Iraq, which may express dissatisfaction with the relatively slow rate of increase in their production and the consequent loss to them of revenue from oil royalties, etc. Taking the aforementioned 1951 production forecast, the approximate overall payments by the oil companies to the Government, at /the9. In spite of the administrative and other difficulties which we msy have to expect if an independent compar\y obtains the concession, it is important that you should not give ar^y advice to the Sheikh which could be construed as directly or indirectly favouring the grant of the concessior to the Koweit Oil Co. or^ other of the big established oil canpanies whether British or • J ■American. A g bus i dor able section of public opinion is continually pressing the U.K. G-overnaent to adopt a policy favouring injnediate internationalisation of oil resources. The allegation is made that the Anglo-American Oil Agreement is designed to protect the position of the existing big oil companies and to prevent independent companies getting a footing in tne- oil producing areas^particularly in the Middle East. It is therefore necessary to avoid any suggestion that we are pressing for the grant of the concession to ary particular company unlessthere are over-riding considerations of great importance which would justify departure from this general policy, we should like of course not give advice favouring independent 1 * companies. 10. l/e should be glad to nave your views as soon as possible on the matters mentioned above. jljA jf- 9.t|s compliment o.9.ag/ty2 ftn * A.. lAlo' U .

X realise, however, that it la a little diff icult to do so when Abraham la on the spot and in view of lyman 9 * opinion that the ^heik is in no hurry to dispose of his rights and that it is unlikely that we will be oonalttcd to aiythii* definite in the near future, we are prepared to wait until Abraham 9 a return in order to aeseee the position.

(B 2036/72/91) Will you please refer to your letter of the 6th February and to Butler* a letter of 10th February. We imagine that the Burma Oil Company are probably well aware of the steel position and that this is a factor which might well influence them to come to an agreement tor joint exploitation with an American company, should they obtain the concession, when this difficulty would not arise to the same extent. If, however, there is any doubt about this we suggest that the Company should certainly be warned that there is likely to be great difficulty in giving them any steel from United Kingdom sources or any dollar exchange to develop a new concession. Subject to these considerations we consider that it would be preferable not to ask the Burma Oil Company, who were under the impression that they had Treasury permission to make a firm offer, to withdraw from the bidding when Abraham is actually in Kowelt. According to our latest information, the Sheikh is in no hurry to dispose of his oil rights in the Kowelt neutral zone, and we agree with Butler’s suggestion that we might wait until Abraham’s return when we would be in a better position to estimate the possibility of the Burma Oil Company being able to develop such a concession either with or without the help of an American company.

In the third paragraph of this telegram reference is made to the Amerada Petroleum Corporation and their association with the Continental Oil Company and the Seaboard Oil Ccrapany. YJe have obtained the following information regarding these last two companies, which may be of interest to you. The Continental Oil Company (Delaware) is a compai^y with a capital of 0 30,000,000, of which about $ 24,000,000 are issued. For 1946 the net income was ^ 19,000,000 and the production owned by the compajqy and its associates averaged daily 95,886 barrels. Furthermore the compai^y is fully integrated, owning and operating 7 refineries and having its own distribution organisation in the U. S.A. The Seaboard Oil Company of Delaware showed for 19^6 a net profit of $ 3,000,000 and had a production of 7,764,565 barrels. In our opinion the Amerada Petroleum Corporation have sufficient assets, knowledge and ability to make a success of any concession they may undertake to develop in the Middle East.

The last definite bid, regarding which we have information, is that of the Amerada Petroleum Oorporation, who offered an initial payment of ^ ^ million, a minima annual payment of £ 500,000 and a royalty of 25 oents per barrel. Abraham informed me informally that he was prepared to raise Burah Oil Canary's bid to £1,000,000. If unsuccessful he would probably approach the Gulf Oil Corporation with the object of endeavouring to arrai^e a tripartite agreement between Gulf, Anglo^Iranian Oil Comp ary and Burmah Oil Ccupaiy, with the purpose of acquiring Jointly the Kuwait share of the petroleum rights in the Neutral zone.

It has however been mutually agreed between A.I.O.C. and Gulf that if either of SEND them should obtain Kuwait’s rights in Neutral Zone it would share them equally with other (see paragraph 2 of India Office telegram 20044 of DESPATCHED 19 14th November, 1946).

We have recently heard that if Amerada Petroleum Corporation succede in gaining concession they will be joined by Continental Oil Company and Sea^board Oil Company of Delaware.

S.W.l. 31st December, 1947« Kuwait Neutral In reply to your letter of the 11th December, I may say that we are in complete agreement with you that a very satis factory solution, if it were possible, would be for the Kuwait Oil Company to secure the oil rights for the Neutral Zone from the Shaikh, The future working problems would certainly be simplified. The A, I, 0. G, , however, are debarred from quoting, even as an equal partner with G-ulf in the K. 0. C. , until the question 5 of the supercession of the Redline Agreement by a revised inter company agreement has been settled. As you probably know, the prospective agreement between the partners in the Iraq Petroleum Company is being so designed as to eliminate the restrictive clauses of the earlier one, leaving each member group of I, P, C. free to seek oil concessions separately where they may please. Inter-company discussions are continually in progress, but Gulbenkian is still holding obstinately to his refusal to sign a new agreement, although the major partners are beginning to feel that they may succeed in overcoming his objections during the next three or four months. There are several court actions pending in connection with the Redline agreement which are E. P. Donaldson, Esq. , C. M. G. , Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1. /unlikelyi 2 - vmlikely to 'be heard before next summer, but it is thought that these actions may be withdrawn if, in the meantime, the participating companies can conclude a new agreement between themselves. It is feared, however, that these inter-comgany negotiations may drag on until it is too late for he A. I. 0. C. to take part in the bidding for the Neutral Zone. Failing the K. 0. G. solution, a partnership between the Burmah Oil Company and the Gulf Corporation would appear to be quite a good arrangement, although in this \ connection I would remind you of paragraph 2 of telegram ^ No t 20.0^ tfry 1hth November f 1946 . which you sent to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, in which it was stated that 'it has been mutually agreed between the two groups (i. e. A. I. 0. C. and Gulf) that if either of them should obtain oil rights from the Shaikh of Kuwait in the Neutral Zone it would share them equally with the other. ' We have no indication as yet as to whether the Gulf intend to increase their offer in the light of the recent higher offers which the Shaikh has received. Since it is our understanding that our position vis- a-vis the Shaikh is more or less that of a trustee, H.M.G. ax are not in a position to discriminate either between one British company and another, or between a British company and an American company. We feel, therefore, that we cannot dictate to the oil companies as to whether and with whom they will go into partnership, although the British companies will undoubtedly consult us before finally committing themselves to any agreement.— 3 EXT t'S if We have recently heard that if the Amerada Petroleum Corporation do succeed in gaining the concession, they will be joined by the Continental Oil Company and the Seaboard Oil Company of Delaware, in the enterprise and we have asked our Petroleum Attache in Washington to give us a line on these two companies.

Their bid is a cash payment of / million, a minimum yearly payment of / 500,000 to be paid until the value of the royalty equals or exceeds this payment, and a royalty of 25 cents per barrel of 42 gallons. &gt;/: The latest comparable figures for the American Independent Oil Company are million, / 425,000, and $ 1.80 per ton of oil, plus one eighth of the value of all gas. If they do secure the concession, Amerada have expressed the intention of merging with 'one or two other American independent companies whose standing will be such as to make them unquestionably acceptable to the Shaikh as well as to the British Government M . According to Amerada, it seems that American companies already represented in the Persian Gulf area would welcome A /the F. A. K. Harrison, Esq. , Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, Whitehall, S.W. 1.the entrance into the field of responsible independent American companies as this would dispel the idea prevalent in some circles that the Persian Gulf area is something like a closed preserve for the benefit of the very large companies. Jacobsen, of Amerada, tells us that the Secrt^ ry to the Shaikh informed him that matters as regards the bidding may soon be coming to a head. It looks as if there is no time to be lost if British interests are not to be eliminated entirely. We should, therefore, be grateful if you and the F. a could let us have your reactions soon to the suggestions made in my letter of the 5th December. I am sending a copy of this letter to Fyman.

S.W. 5th December, 1947* (4^ Dear Harrison, Kuwait Neutral Zone With reference to the bidding for the Shaikh of Kuwaiti oil rights, the Burmah Oil Company are becoming perturbed at the forcing up of payments by the American Independent Oil Company and their latest bid reported by Tandy in his note, of which you sent us a copy, does not improve the situation. The rate of royalty on crude oil of about 9/- per ton offered exceeds appreciably the prevailing highest royalty rate in the Middle East of about 8/- per ton, and there are bound to be consequential repercussions. It is expected that B. 0. C. will agree to better American Independents present terms, but before Abraham is able to discuss them with the Shaikh next January the Americans may think fit to increase their bids to figures which B. 0. C. may well consider prohibitive and that the concession on such terms is an uneconomical proposition. I think we must be prepared for the possibility that B. 0. G. may wish to call a halt, not perhaps completely, but adopting the standpoint that they cannot continue unaided. Doubt less many diverse factors will be taken into account by the Shaikh in awarding the oil rights, albeit the financial aspect is likely to remain uppermost. \ B. 0. C. have tentatively mooted a combination of them selves and some American or other group, to which it is thought F. A. K. Harrison, Esq. , Commonwealth Relations Office, King Charles St, S.W. 1. /there) there could be no valid objection. The Kuwait Oil Company already furnishes an example of a British and American Co operative effort. A joint offer might not, however, be welcomed by the State Department which has lately been encourag ing American 'independent” oil companies to gain a foothold in the Middle East. Before attempting to take soundings, official r otherwise, regarding a rapprochement between competing British interests and, it may be, between British and American contestants, it might be a good idea first to ascertain the Political Resident's views. Being on the spot he may have e facilities for finding out discretely what the Shaikh's reaction v ^ ^ ) &gt; might be to a joint offer from two or more of the current I bidders. In paragraph 7 (”b) of Tandy*s note, mention is made that the Shaikh may grant the Neutral Zone concession within two months, although the source of the information appears to be unreliable. It would be helpful if Tandy could discover whether the Shaikh has any time-limit in mind for receiving bids, or whether he thinks the competitors can be played off against each other indefinitely. We should be glad to know what you and €Tie F. 0. have to say regarding the suggestions put forth above.

Reference to previous correspondence: In continuation of this office telegram No T/151, dated the 14th November 1947. Note by Major M.P.O'C Tafady on activities of American Independent Oil Company. Subject: KULAIT NEUTRAL ZONE uI COPY CONFIDENTIAL. Note on activities of American Independent Oil Company. (A.I.O.C.). In mid-July Mr. Brookes of the American Independent Oil Company arrived in Kuwait and it became clear at once that he was very much under the wing of Izaat Jaafar who acted as his adviser in his approach to His Highness and arranged accommodation for him in Kuwait. I gave him precisely the same information about * /&amp; (p . , JW*? (&gt;■ tne Shaikh’s intentions etc. as other bidders have received. ^• During August and September I beTieve Izaat Jaafar was in contact with Brookes and Isenberger in '^gvpt and the Lebanon. The latter asked His Highness to accommodate him, Brookes, and Holland (Secretary) on their visit in November to bid. This suggestion did not commend itself to His Highness and he arranged for the Kuwait Oil Company to accommodate Brookes and Holland. 3• From various signs it seems more than likely that Izaat Jaafar has received financial inducement to further the cause of the American Independent Oil Company. This will not help them should His Highness discover it - and he will at any rate suspect it ; should Szat make any serious effort to take their part. The latter may, of course, have made a full disclosure of the position to His Highness. A speed-boat is being presented by the American Independent Oil Company to His Highness who told me that Brookes showed him a letter giving the specifications and also quoting the price (about #5,000) and remarked that it it was a very crude way of giving a 'present' and very American. In my opinion it is most unlikely to affect His Highness* decision. 5. Isenberger informs me that several people in the American Government to whom he is 'very close' are anxious that the American Oil interests in the Middle East^hould spread over some independents as well as the majors who at present/—J i } CJ i &lt;m, $ n present have concessions, and added that the twelve companies who have formed the American Indepenfiant Oil Company have some PS 0 , 0 0 to 500,000 stock holders. He tells me that the American Indenendent Oil Company was formed to obtain this concession and^are/one in Chile (he did not mention the Yemen) and that they have &amp; 100 million “to play with”. ^*/*£$**- 6. To the majors Isenberger is very much of a ’’mean operator” and he admitted to me that it was he who made the notorious bid of 33 -J$ royalty for a cohcession covering 3,000 hectares in Venezuela on behalf of the Phillips Petroleum Comoany (it was found to be too ex^nsive to operate and the Company lost heavily). The people who would otherwise have obtained that concession were the Gulf Oil Company. 7. He also stated (a) That he believed that the Tide Water Oil Company had been invited to bid by Abdulla Fulla and that they were not- at all keen. (b) That he had been given a local estimate that the Shaikh would give the Neutral Zone concession in about 3 months. He did not disclose the source but I suspect it was Izzat Jaafar and consequently quite unreliable). (c) That Gulf were bidding on bhhalf of the K uwait Oil Compan y, and (d) That this Comrany had given no thought to what arrangement could be made with Aramco should they obtain the concession. He tacitly admitted that Aramco would not be likely to v/elcome them as partners. g # He and his hangers-on have been most secretive and ”on their guard”. In fact the latter told the butler in the Oil Company house where they are staying that they would rather have their meals alone. 9 # Isenberger’s offer has been reported to me as ^ Initi^al payment ^3,250,000 Annual payment $ 425,000 Royalty #1.80 per ton. and in addition i of the value of all gas.

I explained to him what t.Hteoe iiitlau j and iie 4* appeared very well satisfied. 2 . tfe then touched on the general continental shelf question as applicable to the division of the sea bed of Persian G-ulf in the howeit area. I explained to him our views on the difficult las which would meet any attempt to arrive at s^d&amp;BSSCSk for a division of the Persian G-ulf. Ke said he appreciated this but was naturally anxious that no other Comparer shouldJlrttain on iMmiwe rights in that part of the Gulf which might reasonably be regarded an pertainipe Jto Koweit. He said he thought he might write to us gtffiStng out the Koweit Oil Company’s interest in this area. I said I saw no objection to his doing so. 3. Conversation next turned to the Neutral Zone. Mr. Southwell said he was very worried about the present position. The Koweit Oil Company were expanding their operations very rapidly and were aiming at production of 15-20 million tons by 1950. They required absolutely all the local labour they could obtain and if a new Company started to develop in the Neutral Zone without considaration of the ivoweit Oil Company's development plans and labour from Koweit, this would make it very difficult for the Koweit Oil Ccmpany*, ^rom his own point of view there was only one solution, naiaely that the Koweit Oil Company should obtain the Neutral Zone concession. The difficulty was of course the *Red Line” Agreement but he hoped that this difficulty might be removed in the next two or three months. Ks regards Aramco he said that the Koweit Oil /Company[ A Jt C HF’,* r M. q A Company had no agreement with them regarding the Iveutral Zone at present but that relations with them were very friendly - they exchanged a certain amount of information, etc. and he though there should be no difficulty in coming to a satisfactory arrangement. Mr. Southvrell seemed to third-: that the prospects of oil being found in the northern part at least of the beutral Zone were very promising. I asked him how he would view it if the Bumah Oil Company obtained the concession. He said that while the BumaiOil Company considerable number of Anglo-Iranian shares and the two Companies had certain Directors in common, the policy of the Barman Oil Company would not necessarily fit in witn the policy of his own Company. He also said that on his last visit he had mentioned to the Sheikh of Koweit his views as to the desirability of the Koweit Oil Company being granted the neutral Zone concession. He thought himself tn t it would be to the Sheikh’s own interest to do this in order to avoid future difficulties. The Sheikh already had more money than he could spend at the-moment and . ^ from that point of view there was no point in the rapid r??q?iainijir:m of the neutral Zone by some Compary other than the Koweit Oil Company. 29 . 6 . 47 .I l S L ^ Any reply to be addressed:— [V A®BiISTJtY OF .FUEL AND POWER 7, Millbank, London, S.W.l. Your Reference: r Dear Donaldson, Following PymaiF s letter to Ivlitchell of ^th Adgust, and my subsetiuent conversations with you and Reed, Victor Butler had two short interviews with Jacobsen, President of the Amerada Petroleum Corporation, and formed the view that he does not really expect to get the concession, but that, if he does, he will certainly endeavour to come to terms with the Arab! ax/American Oil Company who hold Ibn Saud*s rights in the Neutral Zone. It appears that a month or two ago the State Department circularised a number of Independents to the effect that there were still areas in the Middle East for which concessions had not yet been granted and indicating that they would be glad to see them taken up by American Independent companies. It looks as if amerada’s interest may be largely to please the State Department. + Mr. Jacobsen had been to see the State Department and when he enquired regarding the probable attitude of the British Government, the State Department replied that they did not know but would be very glad to hear if he was able to find out from us over here. In reply to direct questions he was told that:- (a) as stated in the Anglo-American Oil Agreement, we believe in '‘equal opportunity' and that though we were naturally interested E. P. Donaldson* Esq., C.M.G., /in Commonwealth Relations Office, 4, Central Buildings, Matthew Parker Street, 5. W. 1.- 2 - in whether a British or .American Compare got the concession we would not regard nationality as a sufficient reason for withholding our consent. We regarded our right of final approval as being in the nature of an obligation to ensure that the Sheikh did not get^ himself tied up with irresponsible persons and that the terns of any agreement were reasonable and fair: 4 - . ' ‘ (b) as far as we knew, the Sheikh had not applied any time limit to the bidding for the concession^ A y (c) if he wished to bid for the concession, he should conduct his negotiations direct with the Sheikh, through the latter's Secretary; (d) it would be a breach of confidence to tell him what bids, and by what Companies, had already been put in. He fully accepted this; , (e) we had not formulated any firm views on whether a larger cash payment down would be better than a larger royalty or vice- versa, but that a much higher royalty than was being paid on other existing concessions would undoubtedly cause a good deal of trouble. Jacobsen expressed the view quite bluntly that the sensible arrangement seemed to be for the neutral zone to be developed jointly by the hrabian/imerican and the Kuwait Oil Company. We made no comment on this expression of opinion. You will be interested to know that we have ascertained from the Treasury that H.M.Cr., hold an interest in Amerada to the extent of 226,000 shares pledged under the R.P.C.* loan and 1 , 97 b shares free stock. IV A point on which we would like your advice is that Jacobsen rang up just before leaving for America to say that if they did decide to bid for the Kuwait Neutral Zone concession it would probably be necessary for them to employ as hegotiatbr, at a very good fee, someone with considerable experience of the Middle East and he asked whether we would be able to put him in touch with /anybodyanybody# H© wa.s told that we would think it over and let niii» know if the situation arose, but that our first reaction was that as we wished to be impartial we mi^ht find it difficult actually to suggest or recommend a negotiator to one of the parties seeking concession. Yfe would appreciate your views on this point# I am sending a copy of this letter to lyman. Yours sincerely, ' «r The Secretary, Kuwait Neutral Zone With reference to ray letter of 24th July and to Washington No.74 Elfu of 29th July, our Petroleum Attache there has forwarded a cutting from the New York Journal of Commerce dated 1st August, giving a few supplementary details about the American Independent Oil Co., which you may care to pass on to the Political Resident. According to a spokesman of the Company, no actual negotiations have been started by the group as a vhole for any specific Middle East area or for a share in any existing concession. The rumour that the Arabian American Oil Co. had been approached respecting the acquisition of a share in the latter's Saudi-Arabia concession has not so far been substantiated. The participating companies, in the American Independent Oil Co., are said to be strictly independent, all smaller than the Phillips Petroleum Company, from which it is inferred that the Sinclair interests are excluded as well as any other large companies rumoured to be exploring Middle East oil possibilities. he new organisation appears to have strong backing from the State department, vhich has long been interested in having more American concerns, particularly independents, participate /in. \ HPR. in the develoonient of iliddle East oil. It is reported that N.P. Isenberger, the geologist in charge of Phillips’ foreign interests, is on his way to Cairo and is expected to visit Kuwait and other possible areas.

He had ascertained that the State Department ha cl no objection to the entry of his company into this field. The object of his visit to London was to find out if had any objection to his company bidding for the Koweiti Rights in the Neutral Cone, and if the answer was that H.M.G. had no objection, to find out if the Sheikh had imposed a time limit on the bidding and if the grant of any concession was subject to the final approval of H.M.G. From the Foreign Office point of view there is no objection to this company bidding for the Neutral Cone concession^, and I understand from Donaldson, with whom X discussed the question, that the India Office would not wish to raise objections.

Neutral Zone, ’ Gass, a director of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, saw Victor Butler today and mentioned, in confidence, that the A.I.O.C. were definitely interested in the possibility of securing the Kuwait Neutral Zone concession if and when they became free to put in a bid. As you will be aware, discussions are going on between the partners in the Iraq. Petroleum Company group with the object of amending the 'Red Line Agreement in such a way as (amongst other things) to leave the partners free to undertake oil development in the Red Line area on their own or in as sociation with other companies as they may choose. Various modifications in the Red Line Agreement have been agreed upon amongst the major partners in the I.P.C, group, but still await acceptance by Gulbenkian. Gass appeared to be hopeful that Gulbenkian’s concurrence might be obtained within the next month or two but this, of course, remains to be seen. Meantime, the A.I.O.C, asked if they could be kept in formed about any American bids for the Neutral Zone concession other than by Gulf. Gass mentioned that the 'A.I.O.C, if and when they were free to bid would do so in partnership with the Gulf and on behalf of the Kuwait Oil Company. He also appeared to be suspicious of an initiative of the Superior Oil Compan^in the Middle East and asked if they could be told of any activities by Superior or other American companies Ibcally in the Persian Gulf. I la M11 ' /Gasshi Gass was also anxious to know whether there was any likelihood of the Sheikh of Kuwait reaching a decision on the grant of oil rights in the Neutral Zone in the near r. future, that is before the A.I.O.C. might be free of their obligations under the Red Line Agreement as it now exists. We should be interested in your views on this point. Gass enquired whether it would help if he had a talk with you about this. We told him we had no reason, on our present information, to suppose that the Sheikh would be in any hurry to come to his decision and that meantime we would inform you of the A.I.O.C's interest and would keep Gass informed about any new candidates, particularly American newcomers.

The only inference that Ibn Saud may have 2 consulted or informed the Shaikh of Kuwait before granting the concession of 1939 to CASOC is contained in paragraph 6 of de Gaury*s demi official letter No. C-383, dated the 3rd December, 1938, to Sir Trenchard Fowle (copy forwarded Office under Residency printed letter No. 716-S. dated the 15th December, 1938). Tandy has not been ■§:ble to trace any other evidence on his records and has formed the definite impression from previous conversations with the Shaikh that no prior reference was made to him. 3 Shaikh Ahmad is at present on a prolonged visit to Ibn Saud at Riyadh. Although the former has stated, vide paragraph 3 of my tgifigrflm Nn- T/fn T riatgri v the 12th March, 1947, that he never discusses local poli tics with Ibn Saud I find it difficult to believe that such questions as the Neutral Zone oil concession and possibly Farsi Island will not come under review. The relations between the two Rulers are such that so long as they are both alive any serious dispute between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait is improbable. This may save trouble, but may not in all respects be to our and Kuwait*s advan tage as in controversial matters Shaikh Ahmad is likely to yield to his more powerful neighbour*s wishes. E. P.

Ka«3IT NEUTRAL ZONE lOSl With reference to telegram No. 565 fr om the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf reporting that the Ampco Engineering Company of Dallas, Texas has asked and been given the permission of the Sheikh of Koweit to bid for an oil con cession, we are not familiar with this Company, nor with the activities of Mr. Peairs in petroleum circles. The Shell Croup, from whom we have made some enquiries, also do not know much about these people. They have, however, provided us with some information ( deriving from the Refinery Catalogue of 19^4-) which indicates that they are consulting petroleum engineers, primarily concerned with the design, con struction and operation of refinery plant and oil processing equipment. There is nothing to indicate that they have any experience of oilfield development or crude oil production operations. At this stage, therefore, it does not look as if they are likely to be serious competitors with the other candidates for an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone. We are, however, making some more enquiries about the Company from the Petroleum Attache in Washington. I am sending a copy of this letter to Garran.

In this case, apart from cutting down an already fairly small area, such an arrangement might be unattractive from the point of view of excluding from one of the sectors the most convenient shipping terminal or water supplies etc,. We appreciate that there are definite advantages in a partition scheme, if circumstances make this feasible, and it may be that some of the candidates for the Sheikh of Koweit’s rights would find it easier than others to come to a working arrangement# with the Galtex Group, But it is not possible to tell whether this will be so until the Sheikh of Koweit has made his decision.INDEXED V INWARD T r ' r ‘'~ n A ^ Allotted to Externa Copies to :- Pem.US, DepyoUS, Asst «US'So US, for Buma c AsstoUScfor Bunna ^ P•S«V, (3)o PSoto SS* PS,to US.

E 36^5 Jodca. 25th April 1946. L.. * '''' y ’ I have read your letter No.E 2503/63/91 of April 9th with much interest, but I must confess I find it difficult to offer any constructive observations about oil-rights in the Neutral Zone of Koweit. It is clearly to our advantage that His Majesty’s Government should be able to make a Political Agreement with whatever company obtains the Sheikh of Koweit's rights, but I am not certain how essential this is. As you say, no such Agreement would be operative as long as the s tatus quo continues. On the other hand, it will be much more difficult to define a fx-ontier now, when every square foot of territory is of great potential value, than it was in the past. If an Agreement on the lines of those made with other Arab Sheikdoms In the Gulf is not considered vitally necessary, and the formal division of territory can be shelved, the choice lies between a working agreement for joint exploitation by both companies and some loose geographical division of the zone, if only one tacitly agreed on between the two companies concerned. Provided Ibn Baud and the Sheikh of Koweit are not asked to commit themselves to any final division of the territory, would it not, perhaps, be possible for them to agree about sharing the royalties ? In the circumstances, a profit- sharing agreement might conunend Itself to both rulers; and the two companies, having gambled on the acquisition of ’'rights' which are disputed, might oe persuaded to divide royalties between them. With the passing of years. If a way could be found for the two companies to work in distinct zones, the two rulers might find it best to agree to recognise the boundary of these zones as the boundary of their own frontier. To sum up, a clear-cut geographical division would be the most desirable solution, but I agree with Hay that a search for this would involve interminable and prooaoly abortive negotiations. A working agreement for joint exploitation would be the solution least disturbing of the status quo and general good relations. A half way solution, by whicn the two companies operated in distinct zones and the two rulers split both royalties would work all right until the precise line of geographical division became important to either company's Individual revenues. If the Iraq Petroleum Company obtain the Sheikh of Koweit's rights, the fact that Messrs, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey or Socony-Vacuum now hold a large interest in both the Iraq Petroleum Company and Aramco may facilitate friendly accommodation between the two exploiting interests. Charles W. Baxter Esq., C.J .G., ! .C., Foreign Office.Lepper about the Burma Oil Company-*s proposed concession with the Sheikh of Koweit covering his rights in the neutral zone and we think that you may be interested to have the opinion of our legal adviser on this subject. It is as follows:- A At meetings held at the Foreign Office in 1934 with the Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs the view of the Foreign Office was expressed that no part of the oil concession in the Neutral Zone could be separately granted by either of the rulers concerned, but only jointly by both rulers. The Saudi Arabian representative agreed that his Government was not free to dispose of the concession or any part of it except in agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit. F.A.K. In fact the Seudi Arabian Government has granted to the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company a concession to the extent of. all the Goverment’s 'right, title and interest now or hereafter' in the Neutral Zone and that, I think I am right in saying, j without reference to or the concurrence of the v Sheikh of Koweit. possibly the views of the Foreign Office in 1934 were wrong and the Saudi Arabian Government did not thereby exceed their powers under the 1922 Agreement, and I think their action would now justify the Sheikh of Koweit in making a similar concession without reference to Ibn Saud but on the other hand I am sure that the terms of ’ /the Harrison, Esq.-, * * * India Office.r the 1922 Agreement either Government concession without Government since t fact unseparated, certainly might be and Galtex before but this would dep I have not seen. preclude the concessionaire of from actually exploiting its the concurrence of the other he rights of each Government are To this extent, therefore, it desirable to consult Ibn Saud the proposed agreement is final! end on the terms of the agreemen As regards the drafting of Article 1 of the agreement, I am inclined to think that it does need redrafting to make it quite clear that the concession refer* to the Sheikh’s present rights and interest in Neutral Zone, but I could not advise on the precise wording without seeing the agreement as a whole. Subject to this Iv agree with the Legal Adviser to the India Office, that one must assume that the Rulers will in the future make no arrangement which will derogate f’rom the rights granted by uhem or tend to embarrass the grantees in the fair and full exercise of those rights. A search has been made in our records in order to ascertain whether or not the Saudi Arabian Government referred to or obtained the concurrence of the Sheikh of Koweit when they granted a concession of their rights in the neutral zone to the Galifornia-Arabian Standard Oil Company. We have not been able to find any evidence that the Saudi Arabian Government referred to the Sheikh of Koweit. But this is not necessarily conclusive and you may think it worth while to see if there is anything in your records which sheds any light on this question. nding a copy of this letter to Stock.

I enclose an extract from Abraham's letter of 27/28th February referred to in the second paragraph of Hay's telegram No.T/42, and also a copy of the letter dated 25th February which Abraham sent the Sheikh after his interview. 3, It may be as well to consider at this stage the advantage^ or otherwise of a geographical division of the Neutral Zone since the matter has an important bearing on the form and content of the proposed political agreement between H.M.G-. and the company which obtains a concession for the Sheikh of Koweit's rights. Whether * * hmg/ WhetherWhether H.M.G. will actually be asked by the Sheikh A /d of Koweit to take st^ps to thio oad^U. likely tf) depend on which oil company obtains the Sheikh of Koweit’s rights. If Eastern Gulf do, they will no doubt come to an arrangement with Caltex (if they have not already done so), and the ^heikh will be / content to let the status of the Neutral Zone remain as at present. If, however, the ^urmah Oil Coy. obtain concession there is more chance of H.M.G. being pressed to arrange a division. In either case we ought to consider whether a division would be to H.M.G’s advantage or not, 4, You will see from paragraph 3 of his telegram No.T/42 that Hay*s first reactions were against a division on the ground that negotiations might last years and lead to a revival of boundary disputes .m /C ^ A further disadvantage of a practical nature might be the‘difficulty which would arise if an oil bearing structure were later discovered lying across the dividing line, *■» ' 75 . On the other hand there might be some advantage&gt;in a geographical division of the Zone. In the first place it would obviously simplify administration to have one political authority and not two in a given area. So far as I know there is at present no administration of any sort in the Neutral Zone, but with the development of oil the need for it will no doubt anise. Secondly a geographical division would no doubt make it easier for to obtain a satisfactory Political Agreement with the company to cover the Koweit half of the Zone by itself. The normal type of Political Agreement which has been applied to the Arab Sheikhdoms provides inter alia : /v (a) That the company and any ^/transferee company shall remain British. (b) That may reserve fromAthe operation S'Jq* of the oil company any ajneae selected 'for defence purposes, for aerodromes, aeroplane or seaplane bases ... or in connectionwith the development of harbours r ’. (o) That in a state of emergency or war H.M.G. Ou^b should have the right of pre-emption of^oil produced; may require the company to refine i.ecU J 0 in accorciance with H.M*G*s specification, and have the liberty to take control of the company^ works, plant and premises. We could probably obtain these terms in respect of half the Zone if fully owned by Koweit, but Ibn 3aud would no doubt x-aise objections if we sought to apply them to the whole Zone owned jointly by ■ oweit and Saudi Arabia^ As regards defence sites the Admiralty l lui ^ say they have no requirement. We are consulting^ar Office and Air Ministry though we have not heard of the likelihood of any such requirement arising on their part. 6. I believe the prospects of finding oil are supposed to be slightly higher in the North, i.e. Koweit } half of the Zone, than in the South, but this would make Ibn/Ibn Saud so much the less likely to agree to an equal division. 7. We should be glad to know whether the Foreign Office or Ministry of Fuel and Power have any views to offer on the division of the Zone in the\ light of the above. I suggest that it would be useful if G-rarftey-Sipith’s views could be obtained, 8.

It has been our usual practice in the case of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf for H.M.G. to make a 'Political Agreement' with oil companies that obtain oil concessions from the Rulers. One clause which is normally included reserves from the operations of the oil con^ai^r 'any sites which may be selected by or on behalf of the Sheikh or H.M.G. for defence purposes, for aerodromes, aeroplane or seaplane bases ... or in connection with the development of harbours...'. We should be glad to know whether the War Office would attach any particular importance to the inclusion of such a clause in a political agreement covering the Koweit Neutral Zone, and if they foresee any requirements for such defence sites I should add that unless the Zone is partitioned on a geographical basis between Koweit and Saudi Arabia it might be difficult to secure the inclusion of such a clause. i/ Lt.

My demi-official letter No.3S5~S ^ dated February 22nd. Koweit Neutral Zone,- &gt; ^ • 2. You have presumably by now seen Abraham 5 s letter to me of February 28th and its enclosure. 3* At first sight I am much opposed to our taking initiative in an attempt to bring about a geographical division of the Neutral Zone. Negotiations might well extend over years and lead to revival of boundary disputes with Saudi Arabia elsewhere. 4, I propose shortly to discuss question of Neutral Zone concession in general terms with Sheikh Ahmad and to ask whether he intends to say anything about it during his. forthcoming visit to Ibn Saud. My own view is that -some kind of personal agreement between the two rulers regarding division of oil rights in neutral zone* whether on a geographical or other basis., would solve many of our difficulties. 5. I would suggest H.M. Minister, Jedda, should be brought into the picture if this has not already been done. ■r rpag« 2 4. Coming now to my Company’s offer, your Highness informed me that both P.C.L. and Gulf have offered to pay £.50,000 sterling annually until oil is found in commercial quantities, and we agreed that it would be easier for your Highness to compare different offers if my Company offered the same amount annually. I therefore now do so. 5. Then as to a lump siua payment within thirty days of signature of an agreement between your Highness and iny Company, you informed me that P.C.L. had offered £.200,000 sterling and that Gulf had offered the equivalent of £.250,000 sterling. 1 decided to offer the sum which I had in mind before hearing of these other offers, namely the equivalent of fifty lakhs of rupees £.375,000, and I now confirm this in writing. 6. To summarise: The Burraah Oil Company Limited offers for the Kuwait share of the oil rights in the Neutral Zone between Kuwait and 3audi Arabia: (i) £.375,000 sterling to be paid within thirty days of signature by my Company of an agreement with your Highness, (ii) £.50,000 sterling to be paid on the first and each subsequent anniversary of the signature by my Company of an agreement with your Highness, until oil is found in commercial quantities, (iii) Drilling obligations and other terms such as are in the Kuwait Oil Company’s Agreement to be modified as necessary in accordance with paragraph 3 above, and after full discussion with your Highness. 7. I thank your Highness for agreeing to inform me of the amount of any higher offer which may be made, and for your promise that you will in no case give the concession to any other company without first giving my Company the opportunity of meeting the highest offer which you may at any time receive. 8. I have already thanked your Highness on behalf of my Company for your very courteous treatment of its representative, and I now thank you personally for your kindness to me.1 q 'loo) - page 6 - It has been a great pleasure to r&amp;e to visit your iiij^hneao, and to find you in suoh good health, and I hope that we nay aoon maut again, either in Kuwait or in England.

Hay, ae^r Rupert, KUWAIT, 27th February, 1947. You will see from my letter of 25 February to the Sheikh /^at I have been cioins since I left you. I took this letter in , . — ^~£Ui Abdulla Mulla, who interpreted for me at my interview with the Sheikh on 25 February, and he agreed, after a slight alteration to paragraph 2 and the addition of ,f and after full discussion with your Highness” at the end of paragraph 6(iii), that it was a correct record of what happened at the interview. Agreement with King I bn Saud, 2. see paragraph 3 of my letter of 25 February. His Highness added - but I decided not to record in my letter - that if the necessary agreement with Ibn saud were not forthcoming ”the British government would divide the Neutral Rone into t..o parts”. I should like very much to know whether such division is probable and if so on what basis it would be made. if there is any such probability H.M.G* would no doubt wish to take some geological advice and i have been wondering incidentally whether Rhoades may not now .j® trying to collect such geological evidence as may be available. The Sheikh may have mentioned the nossibility of geographical division to him, just as he did to me. 3 . Anyhow I should be very grateful if you would consider the whole matter more fully - whether there should be joint working of- 2 - ot‘ the h'eutral Zone or a geographical aivision, and if the latter on what lines — ana pass your views to Donaldson with whom I shall be discussing the matter again. We would not of course pay over any large sum of money to the SheiKh until satisfied, in one way or another, that his cession to us of his half-share of the oil rights would be effective, and would ^ive uc toe freedom to test and nro- duce which we desire. Drilling obligations etc. 4, You will see that in oaragranhs 3 and 6 (iii) of my letter of 25 February I tried to cover the ooint which you raised in Bahreir Dollars vs. Sterling, 3. Neither the Sheikh nor Abdulla Hull? has given any indication so far that they value dollars more highly than the '’controlled' sterling eouivalent, and no execution was taken to my use of the ohrase 'equivalent of £250,000 sterling' (instead of 'one million aollars') in paragraph 5 of my letter of 25 February. Tandy has promised to advise you if the Sheikh shows any sign of a oreferenee for dollars as such. Other conditions, 6. I found the sheikh reluctant to discuss in any detail at this stage any conditions other than; (a) lump sum payment, (b) annual payment, ng ana neither he nor Abdulla Mu 11a at any time mentioned royalty to me - nor I to them. I took the risk, for the present, of leavi%22&gt; i 4Q leaving this 'iin the air’’ with my eyes open, ana in the knowledge that (as pointed oat to me by Tandy) the Sheikh*s plan may be to force up the biading on the initial payment and later stage a com petition on the rate of royalty, ienera 1. 7. • For your information I left with Abdulla Mulla, who discussed it with the Sheikh, a cony of our 1946 Balance Sheet etc. I think they were both interested in it but the only question put to me was 'whether Sir William Fraser (by whom was orobably meant A.I.0.0.) owned any part of The Burrnah Oil Oomnany. I of course said n No w &gt; ana emphasizea that although we had holdings in A. 1.0.0. they had t none in us. The strength ana standing of the 3.0«C. appeared to be taken for granted but I made no secret of the fact that our proved reserves of oil were so very small in comparison with those of A.I.O.C., I.P.O., Arabian-American or 3ulf # I think the Sheikh appreciated the significance of this in relation to the Neutral Zone, and generally speaking the Sheikh gave me the impression that we would be at least as welcome as any one else in the Neutral Zone. But of course the real determining factor will be money. The Sheikh is on a good v/icket and knows it. 3. Incidentally, Rhoades kindly showed me round Bungan and I had a chance of emphasizing to him also our real need for oil, and contrasting our position in this respect with that of his own company and of A.I.O.J., who already have so much. 9. I am giving this very confidential letter to Tandy for you. I have taken a manuscript copy which I shall show to Donaldson (with(with my letter of 2^ February) next week wiser not to risk having it typed. I have thought it Best wishes and again many thanks for all your kindness to I hope Sybil arrived safely and that you are all veil.

IA^ / 7 / r^. # Abraham while he was here showed me a /ci ^ f ^ ^ ' complete draft of an agreement between the Burma Oil Company and the Shaikh of Kuwait for an oil concession i./j- in the Neutral Zone. 2 . It is I think premature to consider all the details of the agreement. I gather that what has happened in the past with regard to oil concessions in the Gulf is that the Company and the Ruler concerned have first reached verbal agreement regarding financial terms and that a written agreement has been negotiated subsequently at leisure, the India Office and Political Resident being consulted regarding its terms. 3. In the present case however Abraham acting on my advice has suggested to V/at son that he should show you the first clause of the draft agreement, as it E-. P. relates to the peculiar political conditions appertaining in the Neutral Zone. The exact terminology to be used requires rather careful thought and it would perhaps be worth while considering it at this stage. 4. Watson will no doubt be willing to show you the whole draft agreement if you wish. It mostly follows the lines of the Kuwait Oil Company's agreement. I have pointed out to Abraham that the Company propose to bind themselves to do all sorts of things within fixed time-limits which they may find it impossible to do owing to the fact that they cannot act within the Neutral Zone independently of Ibn Saud and his concessionaires.

On the assumption that none of the parties concerned will agree to a geographical partition of the Neutral Zone I think it may be found desirable for the Company obtaining the concession from Shaikh Ahmad to enter into some fairly brief preliminary agreement with him to begin with, covering mainly financial details. This Company would then be able to negotiate with Ibn Saud's concessionaires for the formation of a Joint Company to exploit the Neutral Zone. The last stage would then be an agreement between this Company and the two Rulers containing provisions regarding production, communications, Customs, etc. It seems to me very difficult at the present stage for either Shaikh Ahmad or his concessionaires to accept any very definite obligations regarding action to be undertaken in territory where they have only undefined fifty per cent rights.V . Dear Lepper, yould y u please refer tu your letter of 21 st February regarding the drafting of Article 1 of you. proposed' Ml Jcaee sion Agreement v/ith the Sheikh of o\ 7 e:lt covering hi rights in the Neutral £cne* I understood you to „ay that the remaining Articles of the draft a reeaent followed the lines of the o.veit Oil Cvinpany's Oduuoereial Agreeiaent of 23 rd December, 1 934. 'i'he ternki will clearly affect Ion Saud and the Caltex C and we should, therefore, have ex acted (th* ugh are not entirely clear on this point J that the Agreement will have to be cle red with Ibn &gt;aud nd Caltex before it may be finalised. In this case iu will piesu.^obly be impo ssible for an agreement ot the t pe c nten?)la^ed to be finalised during ibrahaa* s pro jnt vi: it to Kowoit. e should, therefore, in the cii'cunistaiioes like to hav? the opportunity of considGrini: further with the ministry of Fuel said Power and Foreign Office the precise drafting of this Article before givin, you a definite opinion. Subject to there reservations it may be of assistance to you now to have the opinion of our Legal 'dvie or who lias noted as follows. G. ' iven ii it were possible - and I thirtc it would be somewhat difficult - wQ to frame an article as to safeguard the po it ion of the B.O.C. in the particular manner suggested/ Lepper, Esq., Burmah Oil Com ary, Britannic House, , Fi nsbury Circus, E.C.2.r% suggested, I doubt whether it would be advisable to N appear to anticipate the contingency of an agreement tsj divide the territoiy creo ■ raphically. In the circumstances there would appear now to be no point * in such a div sion, and one nai t, I think, assume that the interests of their respective concessionaires would in any event be present to the minds of both the Rulers, and that no arrangement would be arrived at which would derogate from the rights granted or tend to embarrass the grantees in the fair and full'exercise thereof.'' Tours sinc e rely, F - A - K. HARRISON(23(gN Legal Adviser Please see the letter from the Bumah Oil Company of 21st 'February below and the previous correspondence flagged A,B,C,D about their proposed concession covering the Sheikh of Kuwaiti rights in the Kuwait Neutral Zone, I have ascertained that the rest of their draft agreemoit follows the same lines as the existing concession agreement of the Kuwait Oil Company (see folder). I suppose that the Burmah Oil Company could be safeguarded against any division of the Neutral Zone on a territorial basis by the addition at the end of the draft article 1 of some such words as the following - 'It is further agreed that in the event of the two Governments desiring by mutual agreement to alter the present existing territorial status of the Neutral Zone the rights and obligations of the Oil . Company shall not be in any way affected save fcy «*; f^ tfae express^agreei«»*®£ the Company'. It seems to me however doubtful whether an agreement in the form proposed by the Company is really suitable to an area like the Kuwait Neutral Zone in which two Governments and two Oil Companies are likely to have equal rights over the whole area. In any case the Saudi-Arabian Government and the Califomian-Texas Oil Company (who have a concession for Ibn Saud*s rights ni the Zone, though no detailed concession agreement has^pr^^vatably been drawn up) are obviously directly affected by the terms of the concession agreement between the Sheikh of Kuwait and the Burmah Oil Company. I doubt therefore /whether4 /Telephone: Narch 6902/7. E. C. 2. Dear Harrison, I confirm receipt of your telephone message of yesterday passing on the follov/ing telegram from Ur, Abraham to Mr. V/atson:- 'Suggest show Article one to India Office 'in case they or Foreign Office can sug- 'gest any better wording”. 2. Article one of our draft for an agreement in respect of an oil concession over the neutral gone reads as follows:— 'ARTIOLE 1. - Whereas by a convention 'signed at Uqair on 2nd December 1922 'it was agreed that all rights in the 'Heutral Zone as defined in Appendix 'A attached to this document and shown 'generally in red on the attached map 'should be shared equally by the 'Governments of Nejd and Kuwait it is 'now agreed and understood that all 'rights and obligations referred to in 'the p 2 fra£ph l §r^vETT3Trfollow shall ao- 'oly only in respect of the fifty per 'cent share of such rights ana corres- 'ponding obligations pertaining by yir- 'tue of^the above mentioned convention 'to the shaikh.'Harrison, Esq 21st February, 1947 3 With rsference to the Uqair Convention it is essen tial to our proposed agreement that any subsequent fifty/ fifty division between Kuwait and the Nejd of the territory of the Neutral Zone shall not involve any corresnonding territorial division of the oil rights. We feel that there is some doubt as to whether Article 1 in its present form would safeguard us in the contingency referred to in paragraph 3 above and we shall greatly aooreciate any advice v/hich the India Office or the Foreign Office can give for suitable additions or amend ments to the draft Article. 3. If there are any other points you wish to raise with regard to Article 1 we shall be glad to know. Yours sincerely F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., The India Office, WHITEHALL, 3.W.I. (spare copy attached)You sent us a copy of your letter Ext.7930/46 of the 6 th December about the possibility of the grant of oil concessions in the Koweit neutral zone. 2. We have no comments at this stage though we should of course be glad at the appropriate moment to see any draft agreement that may be proposed in order to ensure that the pre-emption clause is in order. 3. The only other point of broad military interest is to ensure that oil companies are not allowed to use for oil purposes sites which are required for defence. We have no requirements for defence sites in the neutral zone, but you may care to consult the War Office.

We recognise it will be necessary to enter into a Political Agreement with H.M.G. covering the Koweit Neutral Zone should we be successful in obtaining a Con cession covering that area. It is understood that whilst such an agreement would follow the lines of similar agreements relating to other Concessions held by us in the Persian Gulf, certain alterations both by H.M.G. and ourselves may be necessary in this case. E. Donaldson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Yours sincerely.7, Millbank, Ministry of Fuel and Power, London, S.W.l. You kindly sent us a message recently to the effect that you had heard from the Political Agent in Kuwait that the Gulf G-roup had put in a bid for the Neutral Zone concession which showed a higher initial lump sum payment than that offered by I.P.C. You asked whether we felt it possible to inform the latter* I feel that we must be most careful not to use our political position in the Persian Gulf to obtain any competitive advantage over the Americans. I am sure you will agree. On this occasion, however, our scruples did not need to inhibit action as I have been told by I.P.C. themselves that they have received full information from the Sheikh himself as to the Gulf offer. The latter provides for an initial payment of $ 1 , 000 , 000 , which is, I believe, somewhat more than the I.P.C. sum. I have not the papers nandy. The Gulf dead rent was on the same level as that of I.P.C. The latter Group have not in fact discussed the rate of royalty with the Sheikh. The above will perhaps add something to your knowledge and I am writing this letter partly in order to be able to pass a copy to Rowe-Dutton at the Treasury* Yours sincerely. P. A. K.

Mr. Rhoades explained that he was shortly leaving for Koweit where he hoped to arrive about January 25th, to inspect the operations of the Koweit Oil Company and to approach the Sheikt for^concession^ covering his rights in the Neutral Zone. He explained that the purpose of his call • was to acquaint the India Office of his intention. Mr. RJaoades enquired as to the juridical position of the Neutral Zone. I explained this to him and promised to let him have a note about it in writing. I referred in this connection to the question of a political agreement between the successful company and H.M.G. covering Koweit's I rights in the Neutral Zone.

I hope to telegraph my comments shortly on the proposal to conclude a Political Agreement in respect of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. My first reaction is that from our point of view it is in every way desirable that we should obtain such an Agreement and that the only reason for hesitating to take action to this effect is the fear of causing annoyance to Ibn Saud. His Majesty*s Minister, Jeddah, will presumably be asked how that potentate is likely to view the matter. 3. I am writing now to state my views on the 1913 correspondence about Burgan, vide paragraph 2 of your express letter. With all due deference to Kemp*s opinion, I feel that even if from the strictly legal aspect the correspondence can - be regarded as binding the Shaikh to consult us before giving an oil concession to insist on this in practice would be contrary to both logic and Justice. Shaikh Mubarak*s letter is not in the form of an agreement and refers to a specific occasion. Although he uses the word 'never' I cannot believe that he intended to bind himself and his successors for all time in respect of all oil concessions in his territory. In Sir Percy Cox* s letter Shaikh Mubarak was asked to agree that Admiral Slade should inspect the places at Burgan and elsewhere showing traces (presumably external) of bitumen and that if the Admiral saw any hope of obtaining oil therefrom he (the Shaikh) would not give a concession for it to anyone other than a person nominated and recommended by the British Government. The Shaikh replied that if the Admiral came he would send one of his sons with him to show the place of bitumen in Burgan and elsewhere and that if in their view 7 ( = in the view of the Admiral and the Shaikh*s son ?) there seemed a hope of obtaining oil therefrom he would never give a concession in this matter to anyone except a person appointed by the British Government. The most that can be read into this, in my opinion, is a promise by Shaikh Mubarak not to give an oil concession except to our nominee in places showing traces of bitumen which were inspected by the Admiral and the Shaikh*s son (?) and from which he and the son (?) were of opinion that oil might be obtained. I have nothing on record to show what places were inspected by the Admiral and what his views were regarding the prospects of obtaining oil from them, but I do not see how Shaikh Mubarak*s letter can possibly be read as covering places not inspected by the Admiral and I am very doubtful if it can be held to cover places so inspected and not claimed at the time // for exploita tion especially after a lapse of so many years. 4.

(The issue of the above has been d’ily authorised) (S*d)E P. OONALBSON/ / Erf.7930/tf. India Office, Whitehall, S.IV. !• #- • Slleoeir^er,, 1946. Now that the question of some Oil Company, British or American, obtaining an oil concession from the Sheikh of Koweit covering his rights in the Koweit Neutral Zone has become a live issue, perhaps some preliminary consideration should be given to the question of a political agreement being eventually drawn up between the successful Company and His Majesty* s G-overnment. 2, You will be aware that shnilpnr political agreements have been concluded with the respective concessionaire companies in the case of all the Arab States of the Persian Gulf - with BAPCO in respect of Bahrein, withP.C.L. in respect of Liuscat; Qatar and the individual Trucial Sheikhdoms, and with the Koweit Oil Company in respect of Koweit proper. Briefly, the effect of these political agreements is that the Oil Company concerned undertakes to respect the position of our political authorities in the Sheikhdoms, that British, strategic and other interests are safeguarded and that an undertaking is given to enable the production and resources of the Company to be placed at the disposal of His Majesty* s Government in the event of national emergency or war. There is also in the Koweit Political Agreement a clause to the effect that the Company will erect a refinery, if commercially justifiable, and will consult with His Majesty’s Government about this. (There is a Special Refinery Agreement withP.C.L ) The Companies further undertake to remain British by registration (likewise in respect of any transferee or subsidiary companies) and to employ as many British subjects or subjects of the Ruler as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking. Prau the point of view of the Company the effect is that they secure the co-operation of the British political authorities in obtaining from the Ruler the assistance they require in oil developments. K.L. Stock, Esq., // ^ # Ministry of Fuel and Power, Millbank, S.W. 1., ex.:' pc c\i-y u). /i Ifcoli 2 . 3. The case of the Koweit Neutral Zone is different from that of the other Sheikhdoms in two main respects:- (a) the oil rights of the whole of the Zone are at present held jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit and (b) the Sheikh of Koweit may consider that he is not bound under the terms of the 1913 correspondence ( a copy of v;hich is — enclosed) to secure ( To Sheikh of Koweit, dated the agreement of His l 27th October, 1913 Majesty’s Government ( Prom Sheikh of Koweit, dated before concluding a ( 27th October, 1913. concession for the *——■ Neutral Zone; thus we might find it difficult to use the necessity of obtaining our consent to a concession agreement as a lever with the Oil Company in securing the conclusion of a political agreement. A copy of notes exchanged with the Legal Adviser, India Office, is enclosed in connection with the legal position. 4. The form which any political agreement for the Neutral Zone would have to take would, of course, depend on whether Caltox, who already hold Ibn Saud’s share of the oil rights, obtain the Koweit share also, or whether another Company - British or American - do, and in the latter event on what kind of arrangements they uake with Caltex for co-operation in working the Zone. In this connection the question whether the Zone will be exploited from the Kov/eit or Saudi Arabian side (or both) will also be relevant. There is also, I suppose, the possibility of an arrangement being come to whereby the Zone is divided into two distinct geographical areas, one of which Caltex might exploit on behalf of Ibn Sa,ud and the other of which another Company might exploit under a concession from the Sheikh of Koweit. Although, therefore, we cannot go very far at the moment in considering the details of any political agreement, we assume that His Majesty’s Government will wish to have such an agreement, and it may be desirable to familiarise the competing Compajiies with the idea at a fairly early date. This would seem to apply particularly to the Burmah Oil Compary who are not entirely familiar with the political set-upset-up in the Persian Gulf; P.C.L. are, of course, already familiar with the idea of political agreements and. may perhaps be expected without difficulty to fall in with His Majesty's Government's wishes on the subject. 5. We should be glad to have your observations generally. I am sending a copy of this letter to Garran at the Foreign Office and Dodds at the Admiralty (with a copy of the relevant telegrams) and should be glad to have any comments they may wish to offer,. The Admiralty would, I think, be primarily interested in a political agreement from the point of view ox the Pre-emption Clause usually included in these political agreements. We are also asking the Political Resident whether he has any comments. % ) d. h UONALM-SQI^\ | $ (ZH) DRAFT LETTER K. • L # code ^ ^ Ministry of Fuel and Power.

He replied that the E.O.C. did not visn it to appear that they were themselves anxious for a concession in this area or that they had been put forvard by the A.I.O.C. to act in their place or on their behalf. If they did enter this field they were anxious to be able to say that they were doing it entirely at the request of H.M.G. in order to receive as much as possible for British interests in view of the fact that they are lOOfj British whereas the I.P.C. are less than 23fi British. I passed on the gist of the above verbally to Mr. Stock yesterday. I understand they are asking Mr. Watson of the E.O.C. to come and see them.

K, L a Stock, -^sq., Petroleum Division, Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power, 7 Millbank, S.W.l.&lt; On the 24th October I lunched with the Directors of the A.I.O.C. and B*0«C« at Britannic House on the invitation of General W # E*7.Abraham, one of the B.O.C. Directors* So far as I was concerned the invitation was entirely of a private nature* During and after the meal however the Kuwait Neutral Zone was discussed at length* \ * * * 4 4 * ✓ Sir William Fraser stated that some time ago the Gulf Oil Company suggested that the A*I*O.C* should Join them on a half and half basis in competing for a concession in the Sheikh f s share of the Neutral Zone, but he had to refuse the offer owing to the existence of the M red line'. He said that his Company were taking legal advice about the validity of the tt red line' agreement and that it might be five days or five months before they obtained a ruling* If they found they could honourably resile from the agreement and decided to do so it was probable that Mr. Gulbenkian would contest the decision and take the matter as far as the House of Lords, but he did not think that the other participants in the I*F*C* would raise any objection. He emphasised that his prime concern was to obtain s exile British participation in the Neutral Zone and urged that everything possible should be done to prevent the Sheikh from coming to a final decision until the question of the red line had been decided* Mr. Watson of the B.O*C. said that although his Company^ operations were normally limited to India and Burma he would, if necessary, be willing to compete for the Kuwait Neutral Zone in order to ensure British participation* They were in a position to secure a 100% concession, but might perhaps come to some arrangement to share fifty-fifty with the Gulf Oil Company. They are not in ary way bound by the 'red line' agreement • One point that emerged from the discussions is that Aramco are under an obligation to pay royalty @ 8s.4d. to the Saudi /ArabianV Arabian Government on oil won in their share of the Neutral Zone* The Company which obtains a concession f^aa the Kuwait share will almost certainly find themselves compelled to pay the Sheikh royalty at the same rate. This may force the Kuwait Oil Company to pay this rate in Kuwait proper instead of the present rate of 4s.l0jd. though the A*I*0*C* element / ^ in the K*0*C. will certainly resist this increase unless they obtain a share in the Neutral Zone concession. ..... v •. - • - . - , In view of the long time which may elapse before a final decision is reached in the 'red line' question it would appear desirable to encourage the B.O.C* officially to compete for a concession in the Kuwait Neutral Zone. Mr. Watson feared that the Americans might object if the Sheikh gave his Company a 100$ concession in the Neutral Zone. I gave it as my personal opinion that although this eventuality would no doubt be distasteful to them, they could hardly make a formal objection unless the concession were obtained as a result of undue political pressure being brought to bear upon the Sheikh. I feel that the rather querulous attitude which the Sheikh is adopting towards the I.P.C. is due to the fact that he would like if possible to give the concession in the Kuwait Neutral Zone to one or both of the partners in the Kuwait Oil Company whom he already knows. He may well be disinclined to favour the B.O.C. who are complete strangers if they compete alone, but might accent them as partners of the Gulf Oil Company. &gt; E £ If iroad for it* 3* My impression is that P*G.L. would he well advised to employ as negotiator, if possible someone (?known to) and liked hy Sheikh such as Ch isholm and to he less unoriental in their approach* / J lS^u &gt;V \Telephone: : CLERKENWELL 3301 - 2-3 Codes: Bentley’s Second Phrase • BENTliY'S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMB^''' LOMBARD.

(iii) P.C.L. and Gulf Oil both appear eager to end the vacuum at present constituted by the Neutral Zone. .(iv) Except for the possible difficulty of arranging for division of royalties between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia I am unaware of any objection from His Najesty's Govern ment's point of view to the exploitation of the area.

We wish to assure you that we hare not opened discussions with nor made a promise to any persen or pars ons or company or companies in connection with this subject. Certain persons had requested us to permit them to discuss the Neutral Zone*but we refused not wishing that any discussions should take place without . the consent of His Majesty's Government. In this connection we inform you that His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia has promised to grant a concession of his share of the Neutral Zone, and in vi«i of this promise we consider it advisable to negotiate with any company or companies wishing to take up a concession for our share of the Neutral Zone. For the above reason we request you to be so kind aji to inform His Majesty's Government about this matter and to obtain their consent to enable us to open discussions with anyone coming forward, and we hope to receive a speedy and favourable reply. Usual finding.EXTERNAL DEPARTMENT \I K i4 Since we wrote to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. on 8 th October advising them against sending any representative to make an offer to the Sheikh of Koweit for the time being, 4^ the Political Resident's telegram No,1131 has been received. This entirely alters the position and justifies our suspicion that the Sheikh of Koweit has it in mind to negotiate with General Ityron of the Gulf Oil Corporation for a concession covering the Sheikh’s rights in the Neutral Zone, General Pyron is now on his way out to Koweit and Bahrein, A meeting was accordingly held with representatives of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. and the Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power •Mnin morning. The P.C.L, representatives were informed of the latest development. They said that their American and French interests had, even on the basis of our letter of 8 th October, been pressing for action to be taken to approach the Sheikh, and in view of the position as now- revealed, they would wish to send a representative to Koweit as soon as possible to negotiate, arriving, if possible, within the next few days. It was agreed that we should telegraph to the Acting Political Resident asking him to remind the Sheikh of the assurance he gave to Major Holmes on behalf of P.C.L. in 1936, and inform him that P.C.L. would be sending a representative out to arrive within a few days to make an offer to him for his rights in the Neutral Zone. P.C.L. themselves would telegraph to the Sheikh direct a reaffirmation of their interests in the Neutral Zone, and informing him that they were sending someone out to make an offer. A draft telegram to the Political Resident is submitted. &lt;4^ (AtU Ptl- h-Hi *** /£ pjl ■ / Ju HFf- t&gt; t /IFF. in } ■ Jfl CiWCt^h S /£, $ &gt;/******* try. Jtj if! 1 6 J.

Glo^O Hay*s telegram No 1057 of September 28th. Koweit neutral zone. ' ' 2. Sheilch wrote to Tandy September 25_t h reiterating that he has not opened discussions in spiia or revests from 'certain persons' as he did not wish that any discussions should take place without the consent of H.M.Government but now that he has heard that. Ibn Baud 'has promised to grant a concession of his share of neutral zone', he 'considers it advisable to negotiate with any company or companies wishing to take up a concession for our share of neutral zone”. He has therefore asked for H.M.Government 5 s consent to 'open discussions with anyone coming forward'. 3. There is some doubt in my mind as to actual meaning of Sheikh’s words when he alleges that Ibn Baud 'has promised to gran$ a concession'. Read literally (?they do not) amount to much. I suggest Minister at Jedaa might be asked for any information he has on the subject. 4 ^ I/e do not want to be stampeded by Sheikh into precipitate action and his present letter repudiates his old intention of refusing to negotiate for an indefinite period. 5, By using word 'anyone' he proposes a contravention of exchange of letters of October 27th 1913, and I suggest that if H.M.Government is to maintain an interest in Koweit share of neutral zone rights they should encourage Iraq.

However, after what he said to the Political Agent the Sheikh cannot now very well enter into any commitment with General Pyron without informing us, so that P.C.L*s interests should be satisfactorily safeguarded.

Gk a further agreement is made between the two Rulers. There is hiawyor every likelihood that oil will be found in the Zone* In 1939 Californian Standard Oil obtained an oil concession covering Ib^n Saud* s rights in the zone but the Sheikh of Kuwait, in the hope that on Ibfn Saud* s decease he would obtain full rights over the zone, has so far refused to commit himself to any Oil Company despite the fact that there has been keen competition for a concession between the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Eastern Gulf Oil Company (who hold a half share with A* I* 0. C. in the Kuwait Oil Company) • In I 936 we gave an undertaking to I.P* C« that we would take steps ^before approving the grant of a concession to another Company, to see that they had a reasonable opportunity to make an offer to the Sheikh (PZ*6977/39). Prom Ext*3627/46 it appeared that General Pyron of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company broached the question of a concession in the Neutral Zone recently with the SheikhT&amp;rhe Sheikh told the Political ftooidont fy-f' that he had refused to disouss the question with General Pyron* The Iraq Petroleum Coup any, however, have informed us that they have information that General Pyron has stated that he obtained some under taking from ihe Sheikh and was proposing to return in the Autumn to finalise an agreement* The Iraq Petroleum Company are naturally anyinug that their own interests should not go by default and would like to send someone out to Kuwait in the Autumn to make an offer to the Sheikh* It is of course desirable fromH.M.G* s point of view that a Company with a considerable British interest such as I*P*C* should obtain a concession rather than a wholly American Conpany such as Eastern Gulf (or a Joint Lastern GulfKJalifomian Standard Oil Company)* It is true that the Sheikh of Kuwait is under an obligation to H.M.G. not to grant an oil concession without the agreement of H.M.G. but once an American Conpany had obtained a promise from the Sheikh it would as a matter of politics be difficult for us to make the Sheikh cancel this in favour of a concession to a British Company. Clearly v/e must obtain the views of the Political Resident before taking any further action and a draft telegram is now submitted together with an interim reply to the Conpany* M.F.

They told us that General Fyron has been giving out that in the course of his recent visit to Koweit he obtained a promise from the Sheikh of Koweit with regard to the Neutral Z&amp;ne and that he is proposing to return in the autumn to finalise an agreement. The Iraq Petroleum Company are anxious to make some move in the matter and yffr are prepared to send someone out to Koweit in the autumn to make an offer to the Sheikh. The Company also understood that Max Thornburg was visiting Koweit and they were somewhat suspicious of his activities. J.

His Highness replied, intention ally I think, vaguely that there had been some talk of the sea areas and waived it aside as of no consequence.

This meant that he would have to leave London tomorrow evening. Unfortunately, Holmes has un expectedly become involved in some rather drastic dental treatment which it is quite impossible to discontinue. He was compelled, therefore, to say that he could not leave tomorrow. I hope that it will be possible, in spite of this mischance, for Holmes T name to go up again to the Mr Passage Priority Board which, I understand, meets towards the end of each week, and that your efforts will then be given towards securing him an early trip.

Dear Harrison, With further reference to my letter of 50th January concerning Major Holmes 1 visit to Kuwait, I understood, when I wrote that letter, that air passages were relatively easy to obtain. I have been told this morning, however, that the priority system has been re-introduced owing to shortage of passages, and that the benevolent assistance of a Government department is essential for anyone to obtain a passage. Would you be so kind, therefore, as to secure the assistance of the India Office in support of Major Holmes 1 request for an air passage to Basrah - preferable during the first week in March.

One point causes us some little difficulty/ namely the suggestion in paragraph 5 of the High Commissioner’s telegram No.489 that both Palestine and Trans-Jordan should demand a transit fee. You v/ill see that paragraph 5 of the Secretary of State's •despatch deals with this point. The Foreign Office feel strongly that it would be most undesirable to make any such request to this American Company when the Anglo-Iranian and the I.P.C. Companies do not pay any transit fee. We here agree with this view, certainly with regard to Palestine which will benefit from all the activities at the terminal. In the case of Trans-Jordan, however, where the incidental benefits R. SCOTT, ESQ. , ACTING CHIEF SECRETARY, PALESTINEbenefits may be less obvious, it occurred to me that it might be a little difficult for you to take a completely intransigent line with the Trans-Jordan Government. Accordingly we mentioned to Hamilton that the suggestion had been made. Naturally, he did not greet it with any enthusiasm, but if it was necessary, I think he might be ready to consider some form of douceur to the Trans-Jordan Government if it was not too large and if it was wrapped up so as not to appear to be discrimination against the American Company and not to cause the I.P.C. embarrassment by laying them open to demands for increased payments themselves. I thought that I would pass this on to you, though frankly we should prefer that the idea should be dropped altogether. Indeed it might well be argued that such a charge would be contrary to Article 18 of the Mandate;though we have not held this up to obtain a legal view on that point* ' Yours ever, (Sgd) C.G.

A discussion has now been held with Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Lenahan, represting the- Company,' and with their London solicitor Mr. Slade. It was agreed that the simplest course would be to Consider, article by article, the Iraq Petroleum Company’s Pipe-Line Convention on which, no doubt, any Convention with the Arabian-American Oil Company would be 1 largely based. It was made plain that the discussions were of a preliminary and exploratory nature and that it v/as not -31 possible to reach definite conclusions without further consideration* The impression given during the discussions was that the Company had every intention of proceeding with the pipe-line as soon as it was reasonably possible. 3* The following paragraphs set out the points which arose in the discussion. 9 The most important points arose on Articles II and XXI. VJ - ... ARTICLE II (a) As regards the siting of the terminal of the pipe-line in Palestine, it was pointed out to the Company’s representatives that Acre 3ay is becoming overcrowded and that if the Company contemplated this location as a terminal, there might be difficulties in obtaining land for a refinery. Possibly a site rather further down the coast, e.g* in the neighbourhood of Athlit might be more suitable In view of the fact that settlement in that area is sparse and that there is rising ground not far from the shore which would enable the loading of vessels to be done by gravity, -thus saying pumping. The Company’s representatives said that they were not in a position to say where they would like the terminal to be, since no detailed ground surveys of the route of the pipe-line HIGH COMMISSIONER, ----- “ - - THE RIGHT HONOURABLE FIELD MARSHAL VISCOUNT GORT, V.C. , G.C.B., O.B.E. , D.S.O., M.V.O. , M.O. ^ - etc. , etc., etc. 0*1♦ % »N « pipe-line had yet 'been made 'but that they would be very willing 'to discuss the matter with the Palestine Government and to fall in with their wishes as far as possible. It was also emphasised to them,tha$ it would be necessary to get the approval of the security authorities to the site chosen by the Company ■J for the germinal. In the meantime it was proposed that the Convention should not specify the exact site of the terminal, but should simply contain a provision to the effect that the pipe-line should terminate at a point on the coast of Palestine i to be agreed between the High Commissioner and the Company. Incidentally this would avoid the speculation in land which would i result from mention of a definite location. (b) The Company cannot yet say whether they will eventually erect a refinery, but they naturally wish to provide i for this contingency. The availability of an adequate water., supply is a most important factor in the siting of a refinery, and this may therefore affect the terminus of the pipe-line. (c) In your telegram under reference you suggested that the best alignment for the Arabian-American Oil Company T s ^pipe-line would be to follow as closely as possible the Iraq . petroleum -.. Company^ pipe-line from Mafraq to Haifa. The representatives of the Company took note of this point. As already stated t the route I of the line has not yet been surveyed but it-is the inte’ntion. of the Company to take the pipe-line by; the most convenient and direct »! route from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean coast of Palestine and they thought there would, certainly be advantages in crossing the Jordan valley at the highest point, i.e. as near as possible to Lake Tiberias* The Company appreciates the need for keeping their pipe-line well within the existing frontiers during its.passage through Saudi Arabia.. ARTICLE V (Customs Concessions) The Company enquired whether equipment, such as billiard tables required for recreational facilities for their employees would be admitted free of duty. They appreciate that they cannot expect any larger concessions than those accorded to the Iraq Petroleum Company, but would like to khow Low‘those accorded to that Company are interpreted on this point* ARTICLE XII (Taxation ) ' ~ On this Articlq the Company raised a similar point to* that on Article V - whether for example recreation grounds provided for*their employees - would be subject to local rates and taxes. ‘A ARTICLE XIII (Communications) The Company may wish to have facilities for communication by wireless‘with their tankers, and they engjiired whether they would be p emit ted to provide their own wireless installation. It was explained to them that any such concession might conflict With the privileges granted to Cable and //ireless Limited, and that in any case the latter Company would probably be able to provide such facilities as the Arabian-American Oil Company- required. ARTlCtE * XVI * ( \Vater^ ‘AKjCICLB XXI (Cjeneral operation) Paragi»aph 1 of Article XXI of the Pipe-Line Convention jiri.th. the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company differs from paragraph 1 of Article XXI of the Convention with the Iraq. Petroleum Company* In the I.P.C* Convention the Company have to conclude the necessary agreements with other Governments within three years of signing the Convention and submit plans of the line within eight years thereafter under penalty of the Convention being cancelled* In the A*I.O.C. Convention the Company merely have to submit plans within ten years of signature of the Convention under penalty of paying a fee of £25 a year until they are submitted The Arabian-American Oil Company would naturally prefer a provision on these lines. While it would obviously be most undesirable to obstruct the Company^ operations in any way, it must be recognised that the construction of this American pipe-line would probably eventually cause a reduction of sales on the European market of sterling, oil in favour of dollar oil. Accordingly there seems no object in imposing a heavy penalty for failure to construct the pipe-line within a stipulated period and if you agree I should be prepared to fall in with the Company 9 s wishes*. ARTICLE XXIV (Arbitration) The question arose whether it would still be appropriate to include in this clause a provision that failing agreement between the parties the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice should be requested to appoint an umpire. The Foreign Office have been asked for their observations on this point. ARTICLE XXVI (Power to assign Convention) The Company contemplate assigning the rights under their Convention to a subsidiary Company which will be formed for the purpose of constructing and operating the pipe-line. I gather from Sir Arthur Wauchope^ despatch Ho* 979 of the 17th September, 1932 that the Iraq Petroleum Company made a similar assignment to a Company named Mediterranean Pipelines Limited, and that the High Commissioner gave his consent to this assignment in a fomal document under his signature. Presumably a similar procedure could be adopted in the case of the Arabian-American Oil Company. 4. The terms of a Convention with Trans-Jordan have not been discussed in detail with the Company but it is evident that they would wish to sign a Convention similar to that signed with Palestine, mutatis mutandis . 5 5. In paragraph 5 of your telegram you suggest that the Company should pay a transit fee to the Governments of Palestine and Trans-Jordan. I feel considerable difficulty in pressing this proposal upon the Company. There is no such provision in the case of the Iraq Petroleum Company or the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and it would be difficult therefore to introduce it in the case of an American Company without laying oursevles open to the charge of discrimination. The levying of such dues would moreover be contrary to established custom in such matters and if the due was substantial it might materially affect the economics of the whole scheme* The generally accepted practice is that the incidental benefits of such undertakings to the country in which they are situated provide sufficient advantagelio it and I should see some difficulty in departing from this practice. o. I shall he obliged if you will consider the points made in tnis despatch and let me have your observations on them* If you agree, the next step would presumably be to draft a Convention with the Company on the lines of the I.P.C. Convention modified where necessary in regard to the points mentioned in this despatch* I sliould be glad, if you will let me know if you agree to this course* I 1 he draft could be negotiated here or in Palestine as you prefer, but it would presumably be signed in Palestine* Mr. Hamilton has now returned to the United States but Mr* Lenahan has remained in London* Mr* Lenahan is ready to fly to Palestine at short notice if you should consider that that would oe valuable, and Mr* Hamilton will return either here or to Palestine when further negotiations with the Colonial Office can be undertaken* I have, etc . f (Sgd) Oliver Stanley.

In regard to the latter telegram, it is as yet by no means certain that the Gulf Oil Company would wish their share of the Koweit output to go into the proposed pipeline. It is all a Question ot whether they decide'to send it East or West and I do not think they have yet made up their minds on this point. In regard to f s attitude towards the proposed pipeline, our feeling is that the Political Resident, in speaking to the Gheikh, should content himself by saying that H.W.G-, would not wish to •oppose or obstruct a legitimate development of an American undertaking.

Ke wanted to see Hamilton in Bahrain, but instead met 3d. Skinner of the Bahrain Petroleum Company in Basra by appointment. 3. I am not aware of Holmes 1 remain ing interest in the Bahrain or Qatar oil concessions and these telegrams do not convey much to me. I trust, however, that they are more intelligible to you.

He is regarded officially, however, as rather a dubious individual and the ramifications of his interests in oil affairs axe somewhat difficult to follow* We recently lent our sup port in obtaining an air passage for him to TCcwreitL The Political Resident, in his telegram 2252, said that the Sheikh had told him that he had not in fact asked Holmes to come out, but from the Peti*oleum Division* s letter of 1st January there seems little doubt that the Sheikh had in fact done this. I understand from the Foreign Office that Ibn Saud is nowin Mecca, and that thAT' 1 in no indiontiinn that he isjikely to visit the Persian G-ulf Coast for discussions with the Sheikh of Koweit. The rumour, therefore, referred to in paragraph one of the Political. Resident* s telegram 2252 seems unfounded. This is all to the good as we do not want any discussions about the Neutral Zone to take place at prooent.

References to this proposed visit in the autumn were made in several airgraph and cables which Holmes received from the Sheikh over a period of two or three months prior to his departure, and which, in accordance with his usual custom. Holmes showed to Kemp as they were received. I understand that, whereas in the earlier communications the Sheikh assumed that Holmes would arrive in October, the later ones contained enquiries and complaints regarding the delay in his departure from the United Kingdom* /in the D.M. Cleary, Esq* , India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1*In the circumstances, I think you will agree that the foregoing constitutes reasonably convincing evidence that the Sheikh expected and wished Holmes to visit him at Kuwait in October. I am sending a copy of this letter to Wikely at the Foreign Office*. i t i t A. Q.

The Shaikh of Kuwait [Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ] exercised joint control over the Neutral Zone with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Shaikh of Kuwait was likely to seek the approval of the British Government before granting a concession in the Neutral Zone. The papers contain correspondence from some of the oil companies involved, principally the Burmah Oil Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited, details of other (United States) companies involved in negotiations, and correspondence and memoranda from the India Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Fuel and Power, the Political Agent, Kuwait, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
