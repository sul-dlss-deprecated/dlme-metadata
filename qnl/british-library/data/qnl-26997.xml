He en quired in particular how His Majesty’s Consular Offices would treat such a man; would his passport he endorsed when it expired; could a Consul marry him or perform notarial acts on his behalf; and would he, in general, still be regarded as a British subject ?. 2. As I can find no statement of the position in such cases either bn Foreign Office circular instructions or in authoritive text books, nnd as the Persian official is anxious to hare the information, I should be grateful if I might be furnished in due course with material for reply to the above enquiry. 3. While the enquiry was framed in purely theoretical terms, I cannot help wondering whether the Iranian Government's thirst for knowledge has not some bearing on the question of the treat ment of deserters from the Iranian Army who escape across the frontier into British Baluchistan. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 91. I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

In a general way, a good many stolen camels and goods are taken over the frontier in tills way. A ’naib TDuvvum* (Jamadar) at the n&amp;cha frontier post never takes any steps to stop such stolen goods and therefore the wrongdoers are encouraged to take their stolen goods over ft frontier in that way.

Ky Lord, In continuation of my despatch ho. 225 of November 8th, I have the honour to report that 1 have received three further verbal requests for the extradition of criminals. One of these is so vague that 1 do not propose to take any action on it at all. Details of the others, as communicated oy the ministry for Foreign affairs, are as follows s- I. *£ short time ago some Persians named Ghulam bhah, Kamil and Bahman-Baluch, residents of ^arkur, eight farsakhs from Lahidan, in Persia, went to Labul in order to buy wheat together with ^hmed Khan Baluch the brother of Sardar Jum # ehKhan Ismailza'i. They were attacked en route by some persons called abdullah, Karim, Bahim Khan, Idu, and Bijar, who took them and their belongings off to Afghanistan, subsequently their seven camels and their money amounting to two hundred rials vjere retained and they were released. Ahmed Khan, having apparently allied himself with the robbers, went to Nok Kundi and is now there with sardar I. aha mm ad fa’qub Khan Sarhar-dar. w II. 'In the month or Far van din this year (Larch to April, 19 54) one Shah Murad, a Persian, who was wanted for the murder of a woman but had escaped to Zumiran, went from there to Bampusht with the following- personss- Khuda Bandeh the son of Jalal Khan, Kamal Khan the son of Kabki, Ahmed, and ^bdullah, and twenty five other persons unknown. At Bampusht they stole about two handled and fifty sheep belonging to persons named Vaki/Vain, and Shah Dust. Shah Murad then fled across the frontier and now appears to he in company with oahih Khan Bampushti at a spot between the Elver Nahang and /■—'V Zamiran.^ 2. In paragraph '6 of my despatch under reference 1 have given my observations on the general question of requests for extradition and pending a reply from Your Exce liency I shall act in the sense of paragraph 2 of that despatch. 3. The two requests of which details are given above, are, however, of a type which the Government of India might possibly be prepared to consider with sympathy, since one relates to a murder and the other to a case of robbery, and 1 should be glad to learn whether there is any possibility of the Government of India agreeing- to the extradition of the persons concerned in the event of the Persian Government ever putting- forward their request in an official note. 4.

Dated New Delhi, the ^ December 1934. JB^rAiM^e^tr^itlan^i^^ liijLk-Ja A j e Sir, With relference to Sir Beginald Hoare *s despatches Eos. 225 and 229, dated the 8th and 12th November 1954, I am directed to state that the Government of India’s considered policy in the matter of extradition as between India and Persia is, in the absence of an extradi tion treaty and of any reciprocal arrangements, to avoid giving any indication that they are prepared to extradite fugitives from Persian Justice even on criminal charges. A recent case in point is that referred to in my letter No.D.4271-N/34, dated the 20th October 1934, regarding a request for the extradition of arjan Singh and Saran Singh. 2. In practice, therefore, even if a request for r extradition is made formally and in writing by the Persian Government, it will be refused. In these circumstances the Government of India deprecate Sir Beginald Hoare’s proposal to draw a distinction between oral requests for extradition and those received in writing, as such a distinction might lead the Persian Government to expect that the Government of India might be/150 prepared to accede to a formal reguest couched In official form. They would prefer that any reguest Xbr extradition should he met with a courteous intima tion that the Government of India, in the absence of an extradition treaty, regret that they are not prepared to extradite fugitives from Persian justice. 3. They would, therefore, ask that, if there is no objection, the four re guests of the Persian Government now refarred to them should be dealt with on these lines. They would not of course desire to interfere with your discretion if in any particular case you should decide that an oral and informal foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

It was dated the 9th August and intimated that both ARJAH SINGH and SARAN SINGH had been tried and sentenced to pay fines under the Passport Act. Also that as a telegram had been received in which theee men were accused of evading the payment of a large sum of money they had been detained for investigation. The Assistant Political Agent asked whether there was any thing against the men and fhether it was considered that they should be turned back to Persia or allowed to proceed. 8. as the continued detention of these persona appeared to me to be open to misapprehension I thought it advisable to send a further communication to tne Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan# and therefore# in connection with the telegram referred to in Jaragreph 5 above, deepatched on the 21st August a t.legrara under No 241 i- 1Y TELEORAT OF 25TH JULY 223.

The Governor replied that as the case had been referred /to4. ®&gt;&lt;S) to Tehran he regratted he could not deliver the passports without instructions from the capital. 10. In explanation of the manner in which these two passports came into the hands of the Persian authorities His Majesty 1 s Vice Consul informs me that as some of the creditors feared that the debtors* whose affairs were under examination, would endeavour to escape into India the Civil Court was approached with a request that the two men be imprisoned. This was agreed to and the men were placed in custody for a short time until released by order of the superior court at Birjand, which held that the Civil Court had no right to interfere unless and until, the creditors had filed regular civil suits, nevertheless, though released, their passports were detained by the Persian Police Office. 11. It appears that the absconders obtained camels aoi and escaped at night into British territory where at the instance of two British Indian creditors from Zahidan who had intercepted them, they were apprehended at the JTJSSAX Levy Post and t ken to NOK-KUHDI under arrest. 12.

B. Hoare received a copy of Metcalfe^ letter direct, and I now enclose a copy of his reply to Metcalfe of March 23rd, which shows that for the present he is quite ready to accept the proposal to drop his scheme for surrendering refugees who abuse the right of asylum. 3. We for our part have no objection to the suggestion that the scheme should be dropped for the present, especially in view of the danger, pointed out by Maconaohie, that the Afghans might demand similar treatment; and we also agree that requests by Persia for the surrender ofordinary criminals like iChan Mohammed should normally be refused on the grounds of the absence of an extradition agreement.(^) C ^ (E 1832/88/34) N o,138/0-6 .

No.F 337-N/30 of February 27th to the India Office that my ’’one-bite' Baluchistan frontier idea be drooped; but I cannot subscribe to the doctrine that there is no difference between the procedure suggested in my scheme and extradition under an extradition treaty, and I Just want to suggest that you keep an open mind on the subject in case I ever wish to try and convince you that there is a big difference. For the present I have no desire to provoke any action vis-a-vis the Persians in the spirit which inspired ray letter to Howell: they have behaved outrageously over the Anglo-Persian Oil Company business and until that has been liquidated and they really seem to want to put relations on a good footing I think it would be bad tactics to make any effort to meet their susceptibilities or remove any grievances or disabilities under which they may be labouring. For the moment it’s a case of ’ deb ell a re superbos 1 : later let us hone that we shall have to consider what is the appropriate moment to ’parcere subjectis’.

I now enclose a copy of a demi-official letter from • • • Metcalfe giving the Government of India* s views as to the kind of action which might be taken on the Perso-Baluch frontier in regard to fugitives from justice and other refugees. 2. Subject to your concurrence we agree with the Government of India that Hoare's scheme should be definitely dropped and we think that refugees who abuse, or are likely to abuse, their asylum on our side of the frontier should be dealt with, if possible, as the Govermsnt i of India suggest, by disarming them and removing them from the vicinity of Persian territory. In-tharS connexion it is relevant to remark that most of Baluchistan consists of non-British tribal country over which the Gprernment of India have little ! 3. We also agree with the Government of India that requests by Persia for the surrender of ordinary/— ordinary criminals like Lashkar Khan and Khan Mohammed should be refused on the grounds of the absence of an extradition treaty. You will have seen from the correspondence forwarded with our printed letter No.P.Z.987/33 of 22nd February that in the case of Khan Mohamed the Government of India have already suggested to Hoare that the Persian Government should be informed that they are unable to take any action since Khan Mohamed is in Afghani stan. 4.

P.Z.7264/32* dated the 6th January 1933, asking for the Government of India’s views as to the kind of action which might he taken on the Perso-Baluch frontier in regard to fugitives from justice and other refugees. 2. After consulting the ASent to the Governor General in Baluchistan, the Government of India are of opinion that the proposal mooted by Hoare in his deni-official letter to Howell of the 28th Decanter 19 31 (a copy of which was sent to you by the Foreign Office) should be dropped since they can see no difference in effect between the procedure there suggested and extradition by virtue of an extradition treaty. As it seems to them the most that could be offered to the Persian Government in the absence of an extradition treaty would be to disai^i and remove from the vicinity of the border criminals and other refugees whose residence in that vicinity is likely to disturb the peace of the border or create trouble for the Persian Government. Requests by Persia for the * surrender of ordinary criminals like Lashk a r Khan a nd Kh a n Mohd should they consider be refused as is done in the case See despatch from Hi s Maj esty f s Mini ster, Tehran, to Government of India, Ho. 268 dated the 27 th December 1932 - copy sent to Foreign Office (Ho. 550).

( ? letter 158-M dated 10th November 1932 regarding the proposed surrender to the Persian Government of an alleged murderer named Khan Mohd. Copies of these papers were sent to Kabul and I enclose a copy of Maconachie v s Demi-official letter 239-B dated 12th November 1932 on the subject. The point which he raises does not appear to have been considered before and it certainly interposes a formidable obstacle either to surrender in this particular case or to any such arrangement as was recently suggested by Hoare and tentatively agreed to by His ISajesty’s Government and the Government of India (vide Demi-official correspondence ending with Laithwaite’s letter P.Z. 3570/32 of 14th July 1932). Soared principal argument in favour of making that arrangement with Persia was that the Persian Government had been 'fairly obliging when asked to deport undesirable Indians'. We have on record not more than two cases of Indian subjects being deported from Persia and the Government of India are doubtful whether this argument is strong enough to justify our incurring the risk which Maconachie anticipates. The Government of India also agree with..with him that the time has not yet come when we should be justified in surrendering to the Afghan Government Afghan subjects accused of criminal offences who had taken refuge in British India. It therefore seems that the whole question requires reconsideration and I am to suggest that the Kinister at Teheran might be asked not to approach the Persian Govern- ✓fV’ v ryO 0 ment on the lines suggested in his Demi-official letter Ho. t 138-2 of 24th May 1932 to the Foreign Office pending such reconsideration. As you will have seen the Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan has been asked to trace and arrest Khan Mohd. but no further action will be taken towards his surrender to the Persian Government until the views of the Secretary of State on the general question are received. I am sending copies of this letter to Hbare and Maconachie. Yours sincerely, TO J. C. Walton, Esquire, C.B., M. C., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London.&lt;y fidential Demi-official No.239-(B) ^ Br ^^ 1 2 Legatio n, Kabul 12th November 1932 Dear Burnett V yfjtljur I am rather alarmed by Tehran despatch No.216 of October 22nd, suggesting the surrender of an alleged murderer to the Persian authorities in spite of the absence of an extradition treaty. If this is done, and the Afghan Government get wind of it and demand 'most favoured nation' treatment in the matter, what are we to say? We have resisted tentative requests of this kind from them in the past, on the very firm ground of the non-existence of an extradition treaty, and if I may say so I think it most desirable that we should be able to maintain this attitude, at any rate for some time to come.

I also enclose a copy of a letter from Howell, stating that the Government of India are prepared to give my scheme a trial. Will you let me know whether His Majesty’s Government have any objection to my approaching the Persian Government on these lines at a suitable moment. If Howell comes here (he is at present ill in Baghdad) I will discuss the scheme with him further but unless you hear from him to the contrary when he reaches England you may assume there are no further observations to be made. I am sending copies of this letter to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No.107) and to Sir E.Howell at Baghdad, who is ill and is forbidden to come, which is sad. G.W.Ren'’el, rnsQ. , Foreign Office.Confidential Decera'ber 28th, 1931. I enclose translation of a note from the Persian Government, complaining about one Haji Nawab ^han who escaped into British Baluchistan last year, presumably (as the note talks about ’'insurgents” and ''rebels”) because he did not appreciate the centralising activities of the Persian Government. He was therefore a political refugee and as such fully entitled to asylum. Now, however, he appears to have turned brigand, which I imagine is the normal metamorphosis of these 'rebels” especially if they live in the neighbourhood of a satisfactorily difficult frontier. Of course, it is quite easy to tell the Persians as we did last year in the case of Lashkar Khan (see note enclosed in Clive's despatch No.70 to you of the 13th April 1931), 'produce your 'evidence and we will consider whether or no we 'can, in spite of the absence of an extradition 'treaty, properly hand him over'. This is all very well in theory but I do not think that it is satisfactory in practice and it also turns the Persians thoughts towards an extradition treaty which the TT ^ 0 T r, -r -ci Government • i3• xiowe 1-1 $ j ^ ^ 0 • X • 1C • p Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New DelhiGovernment of India don’t want - and quite right too. I have some sympathy with the Persian point of view badly though they express themselves, and though their troubles are mainly due to their own methods and inefficiency, and I fancy that it is a law of nature for the Persian to think that we are delighted to see him in trouble. Do you think something of the following sort would be in any way possible without a serious risk of tipping you out of the not unbearable frying pan of Persian displeasure into the fierce fire of Baluchi anger (cf. the letter No.164 PZ of July 7th from the Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan to the Government of India),:- Tell the Persian Government that if they care to instruct the Governor of Persian Baluchistan to inform the Agent to the Governor-General at Quetta whenever a ’ , rebel ,, has escaped into British Baluchistan and at the same time indicate the approximate point at which he crossed the frontier, you will be prepared to warn the ,, rebel ,, that if he goes back to Persia for whatever reason and then returns to British Baluchistan without a passport ( a passport would be proof that he had made his peace with the Persian Government) he will on the demand of the Governor be handed over to the nearest Persian frontier post. My idea is that 'rebels' are allowed one bite, but that more than one becomes a nuisance all round. Pour or five years ago I tried to put through a* a rough and ready arrangement of this nature in respect ol the Turco-Irak frontier: as far as I remember the Foreign Office viewed it with favour, hut Dobbs insisted on something more formal which eventually resulted in the f, Bon Voisinage articles of the Treaty 'of Angora of June 1926 (CMD.2679)'. I have no idea how the Persians would view such a proposal, nor really do I greatly care, nor, if they accepted it, do I think they would make serious use of it. But I should, mildly, like to make the offer as it would, or at least should, remove a sense of grievance, I would propose to reserve the right to cancel the arrangement if it proved inconvenient. A concrete argument in favour of my proposal consists in the fact that the Persians are fairly obliging when asked to deport undesirable Indians. Will you let me know whether this or something similar would be unobjectionable from your point of view. Until I hear from you I shall say nothing to the Foreign Office. (Sgd) R.H.Hoare.Translation of a note from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs (English Section) to His Majesty’s Minister. Dated Azar 11th 1310 (December 3rd, 1931) No. 31034/2102581. Monsieur le Ministre, In continuation of my note No.18526 of Mehr 12th 1309 (October 4th 1930) in connexion with the illegal action of the Persian Baluchi insurgents in escaping to the territory of British Baluchistan in order to continue their mischievous acts, and the failure on the part of the British frontier officials to prevent the entry of these rebels into British Baluchistan, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that a further communication has been received from the Ministry of War stating that Haji Nawab Khan, the Ba-uchi, who had fled last year into British Baluchistan territory, has again returned to Rask and Pishin situated in Persian territory and has taken away with him all the property belonging to Zar Gol, the wife of Ali Mohammed Khan, the father of Doust Mohammed Khan (sic). He was accompanied by a number of armed men. The Persian frontier officials are, therefore, complaining bitterly against the fact that the frontier officials of British Baluchistan are allowing the insurgents escaping from Persian territory to enter British Baluchistan frontier without any hindrance or examination (sic) and thus enable them to escape further pursuit by Persian officials and that, furthermore, after some time they allow them to come back to Persian territoryterritory, a fact which encourages the insurgents and rebels to increase their mischievous acts and will inevitably jeopardise the order and peace of the frontier* In these circumstances, I have to reiterate my former expectation in this respect and shall be particularly obliged if you would be so good as to take energetic measures so that the frontier officials of British Baluchistan may not prepare the means for facilitating the mischievous acts of the insurgents and do not allow the refugees to cross into British Baluchistan territory without making enquiries into their case or examining their passports and do not let them make the territory of British Baluchistan a shelter for their rebellious activities. I shall also be obliged if you would inform me of the result of your action in the matter at your earliest convenience. (Sgd) Peroughi.Confidential Simla. D.0.F.337-N/30. 2 nd May, 1932.

The facts as 1 recorded them in a note to the Persian Government were as follows Baluchistan rohhers attacked a party of three men between ^ahedan and Zabul, killed two of them and escaped into British territory. They were followed by Sardar Juraa Khan the Reis-i- Amnieh (Chief of Road Guards) at Zahedan (who has since been transferred to Zabul) with 15 Persian Levies, who, on reaching the British post at Piran, requested the naik (Lance- Corporal) in charge of the post to assist him in tracing the criminals, fhis they agreed to, and one of the men was soon captured. The heis-i-Amnieh then insisted txiat the man should be handed over to him,and on meeting with a r^iusal until the matter had at any rate been referred to higher.authority, threatened to use force.

They were further to see if the establishment of any additional posts along this part of the frontier was necessary.

Persian Government were as follows j- Baluchistan robbers attacked a party of three men between Sahedan and 7.abul t killed two of them and escaped into British territory. They were followed by Ssrdar Juma Khan the Keie-i- Amnleh (Chief of koad Guards) at Eahedan (who has since been transferred to 'abul) with 15 Persian Levies, who, on reaching the British post at Piran, requested the naik (Lance- Corporal) in charge of the post to assist him in tracing the criminals. This they agreed to, and one of the men was soon captured. The Reie-i-Amnieh then insisted that the man should be handed over to him, and on meeting with a refusal until the matter had at any rate been referred to higher authority, threatened to use 2o The facts as I recorded them in a note to the force.

It will be seen that it blandly ignores my request and goes so far as to suggest that as, in the view of the local officials, Firan should be included in Persian territory, they were fully entitled to take the action that they did take. 4. Simultaneously with the arrival this fantastic reply, I received further details of the incident from his Majesty's Consul at Sistan. 5. I decided that as the best way to get the matter treated with the seriousness it deserved,/to send the Acting Oriental Secretary to see Jelal, the heaa of the laiglish section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and point out to him that it would be quite impossible for His Majesty's Government to allow the matter to arop and suggest to him that the wisest course would be to withdraw the present note and substitute for it one in which I should be assured that the officer responsible would, after investigation, be properly dealt with.

I am in full agreement with trie views expressed by His majesty's iate Kinister at Tehran, in his despatch No.124 of the 19th hay last,especially those in paragraph 6 thereof,and venture to opine that no definite advantage would be gained by such a treaty at the present juncuure in Persian affairs. Further,that the conclusion of a Treaty confining its scope of operation to frontier districts could hardly serve any advantage as far as the Government of India were concerned. Such a Treaty,it is added, would chiefly apply to Persian subjects passing the frontier into British territory,as the w number of British subjects crossing the frontier from British territory can hardly be said to be very numerous. The interference with Baluchis emigrating from Persian territory into British India,it might be added,would give umbrage to theiijnumerous relaGives across the border. If however it is proposed to conclude a Treaty of univer sal application, it might be of use to the Iruian Governm.-nt in securing the extradition of individuals required by our Courts in India for Criminal offences,although at the s-am time it would be no difficult task for the Persian Governmentr uonfldential&gt; From No. F.337-N/30 z' The Foreign Secretary to the GoTernment of India, To The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London. Proposed Extradition Treaty with Persia. Sir ’ /% I am directed to refer to your letter No. P.Z.4862/31, dated the 13th August 1931 regarding the desirability of an extradition treaty with Persia and to state that the Govern ment of India are of opinion that it is undesirable to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty for the reasons, inter alia, thats- (a) it seems highly doubtful whether the provisions of any such treaty could in fact be satisfactorily implemented by either side; and (b) before the Government of India could agree to the extradition of offenders claimed by the Persian Govern ment they would require to be satisfied that the treatment accorded to the latter would be in accordance with the ordinary dictates of humanity. 2. The Government of India observe that as a matter of fact His Majesty*s Minister at Tehran has already received instructions to avoid discussion of an extradition treaty with thethe Persian Government(vide foreign Office telegram to Sir Robert Clive dated the 17th June 1931). Vhil« the Government of India were not consulted before these instructions issued, as the latter are in accordance with the conclusions they have themselves reached on the subject they have no further comment to offer* I have the honour to be.

Proposed Extradition Treaty with Persia. , 'To t r • • » » • • • I have the honour to refer to your Confidential letter No.P*337-n/3Q of 10th June 1931. Whether the proposed treaty were to apply to the whole of Persia or merely to the frontier districts, I am of the opinion that no advantage whatsoever would be gained “by the Government of India 'by its conclusion. The desirability of such a treaty has been pressed on the Persian Government by the G-eneral Officer Commanding in the Sarhad, who has frequently mentioned the matter to me. I have always replied that it is a matter which should be taken up by the Governments concerned and that I could not enter into any local arrangements whatsoever* At present the u.O.C. is obliged to adopt a moderate attitude towards the Baluchi tribes, since unduly harash treatment causes them to flee the country to British territory. Once assured that he could effect extradition, I am convinced ^tniat^he would adopt the more usual Persian methods, from enclosure Tn ^ T jia foreign ^mrest among the tribes would increase causing us 0 thereby increased anxiety as regards the frontier. The Dated 1 5 AUG. T5jT 24 AJK 1 1 ! BSn class in which we are interested in having removed from Persia are Revolutionaries and they would remain 08] outside the scope of a treaty. If it be decided to returnan unfavoura'ble answer to the Persians, I would, suggest that it might be desirable to keep open the door for their good offices in expelling revolutionaries and to this end we might offer to consider, on their merits, cases in which subjects of either State engage in revolutionary activities or Political propaganda of a nature to embarrass their own u-ovemment* In this connection it might 'be possible for the uovemment of India to take some action in the case of lashkar Khan, whose offences are, I imagine, of a political nature, should the Persians prove helpful in regard to the revolutionaries referred to in His Majesty’s Minister’s despatch No* 124 of May 8th. The latest information I have in this matter is that the individuals have 'been sent to Tehran under escort to make an appeal against deportation. They are practically without means of subsistence, and should they succeed in evading explusion from the country we may safely assume that money has been found to assist them from the resources of a foreign power. I have the honour to he. Sir, lour most obedient servant, 3d/- C.K. Daly, Major. h.M.

Bustiire, ttie 27tti July 1931* ^itti reference to your memorandum wo.P*337-]m/ 30, dated ttie 9tti July 1931, my views are as follows. 2. On general principles our treaties wi tti Persia should 'be confined to those which we cannot avoid making. As Sir Rotiert Olive points out (paragraph 5 of his despatch No.124 of May 19th) the Persian trovemment is possessed of an obstructive mentality, which does not give much hopes that any treaty negotiations with them are likely to come to a satisfactory conclusion. In addition to this the Persian u-ovemment is little likely to keep at all strictly any treaty which it may suit them to break either in the letter or in the spirit* As on the other hand his Majesty’s Groverament of course implement their treaties with the greatest strictness any arrangement with Persia is likely eventually to resolve itself into a unilateral agreement to our disadvantage. 3&lt;&gt; On more particular grounds I concur with Sir Robert Olive (paragraphs 4 and 6 of his despatch) in thinking that there would not appear to be much advantage to the (Jovern- ment of India in the proposed treaty. The extradition of political offenders, Sikhs and others at Duzdap, etc., in whom the Government of India is doubtless especially interested, could not be covered by the treaty - generally s± speaking I believe that extradition seldom, if ever, covers political offences - while once a formal treaty was made any special arrangements which, I understand, have been'been made in tbe past witb. regard to the explusion of* particular individuals from Persiai would presumably be impossible. On tbe other band should the Persian Govern ment desire the extradition of political offenders, fugitive tribal chiefs for instance into .British Baluchistan, they would not hesitate to trump up criminal charges against them, and the ensuing investi gation into the.truth of those charges would probably give rise to controversial matter between the Government of India and the Persian Government* 4* It is not improbable also that once negotiations had been entered into the Persian Government might introduce the question of extradition from the Arab States of the Gulf, i.e*, Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait, a question which I imagine the Government of India have no v/ish to see raised.

WALTONX (T 96X0/6797/374) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 10th August, 1931 ^ Dear Walton I have looked into the correspondence regarding the proposed extradition treaty between India and Persia, with reference to the point raised in your letter PZ 4122/31 and it seems that although the Persian proposal was doubtless intended to refer primarily to an extradition treaty with India, their Note to Clive spoke of an extradition agreement 'with your Government'. We read this as meaning an agree ment embracing the United Kingdom, and the fact that in paragraphs 2 and 5 of his despatch No.124 of May 19th,1931 to the Government of India Clive speaks of the benefits (or absence of benefits) which would accrue to His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India, seems to leave no doubt that he also* shared the view that a general extradition treaty was intended. Our telegram of the 17th of June was, therefore, intended to convey our views so far as the proposal might refer J.C.Walton, Esq, .. , C.B. , M.Crefer to a treaty with the United Kingdom, and also to ensure that Clive would not act on any instructions from the Government of India without first referring the matter home. — —Register No. Tz. k»6z/-3\.

As regards the Persian Note of 4th October, 1 n-ZA 4 . u O x ^ f o. CJXUa f. ^ ?Z.T3*Z(Vi f 1^30, the Secretary of State^expressed his geheraX -- ~ agreement with the line of reply recommended in paragraph 5 of the Government of India’s letter of 12th Lay on P.Z. 3382/31. On the vdaole, however, for the reasons given by the Foreign Office we may, I think, agree that it will be preferable to let the matter drop and, subject to the views of the Government of India, we may agree on this point. Paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter under reply raises the question, which has been the subject of discussion on P.Z. 4122/31, of the desirability of pursuing further the Persian Government’s suggestion that an extradition treaty should be concluded. The demi-official correspondence on P.Z. 4122 will have made it clear both to the Foreign Office and to the Government of India that the Secretary of State was disposed to agree that the argunents against the conclusion of any extradition treaty at the present juncture were conclusive. We may, however, give the Government of India a further chanceof expressing a view on the subject, more particularly in view of the fact that the instructions (now described as 'provisional') sent by the Foreign Office on 17th June to Sir R. Clive and instructing him to allow the suggestion to die a natural death if possible, were sent without consultation with them or our concurrence, and that they have in the meantime been in consultation with their local t officers affected. It my be observed on this point that Baluchistan regard the conclusion of any form of extradition agreement with Persia as 'from the local point of view' 'unnecessary, if not undesirable', while the Consul-General at Meshed is of opinion that, so far as Khorassan is concerned, such a treaty is unnecessary. * The views of the Consul in Seistan, who is directly M***«^* » * 4 * * concerned, ^rtiroT 'the~PoTTtical Resident in the Persian Gulf have not yet been received.

On the point raised in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter of 29th July, the Secretary of State is in general agreement with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and, subject to the observations of the Government of India, considers that, for the reasons set out by the Foreign Office, it would be preferable not to return any reply to the Persian Note of 4th October/October, 1930. On a further point arising out of paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter of 29th July, I am to say that the Secretary of State, as the Government of India are aware from Mr Walton’s demi-official letter of 30th July, No. P.Z. 4122/31, to Mr. Howell is,as at present advised,disposed to agree with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as to the undesirabil of attempting to pursue in present circumstances the question of negotiating an extradition agreement :.ty with the Persian Government. He would, however, be glad to receive the observations on this point of the Government of India, in the li^it of the reference made by them in their circular letter of 10th June, 1931, No. F.337-M/30, to the local Administrations and officials &lt; affected. !&lt;\ J.

Sir, S.W.l. 29th July, 1931. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.P.Z.3382/31 of the 4th July regarding the reply to he made to certain proposals, put forward respectively by the Persian Minister, for Foreign Affairs and the Persian Military Governor in the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan, in the interests of improved control along the Perso-Indian frontier. 2. With regard to the proposals put forward by the Military Governor, Mr. Henderson agrees that there is no objection to His Majesty^ Consul for Seistan and Kain being instructed to reply in the sense suggested by the Government of India in paragraphs 3 and 4 of their letter of the 12th May, ^ * should either of these questions again be raised by the Military 31 Governor. 3. Mr. Henderson feels some doubt, however, of the desirability of replying to the Persian Government’s note of 'sull r -(October 4th, 1930, in the sense suggested by the Government of PZ ??szftl* India. The Persian note appears to have been written in consequence of the military operations then being undertaken against the tribes in Persian Baluchistan in the neighbourhood of the Perso-Indian frontier, and it would scarcely appear necessary now to return a reply, long after these operations have come to an end. Moreover, the reply suggested by the Government of India appears to raise the question whether tribal insurgents are to be considered as political offenders or as mere brigands, a question closely connected with the larger question The Under Secretary of State, India Office.question of the negotiation of an extradition agreement with Persia. This larger question has, in fact, recently been raised hy the Persian Government, as will be seen from the enclosure in Sir R. Clive f s despatch No.235 of May 8th, 19J1 a copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No.T6797/6797/374 of June 22nd last, and provisional instructions have recently been sent to Sir R. Clive not to discuss the proposal without further instructions, but to allow it if possible to die a natural death. Mr. Henderson is, in fact, disposed to consider it definitely undesirable to pursue with the Persian Government in present circumstances the question of negotiating an extradition agreement. He will be glad to receive Mr. Secretary Berm’s views and those of the Government of India on this point in due course, but in the meanwhile he would suggest that, for the reasons explained above, it would be preferable not to return any reply to the Persian note of 4th October, 1930. 4.

Subject Proposed extradition agreement between Persia and India. I have the honour to refer to Mr. Wylie*s letter No. F.337-N/30, dated the 10th June 1931 calling for my views on the proposed extradition agreement betweai Persia^ and India. 2. For about 3/5th of its length the boundary between Baluchistan and Persia is the boundary of Kalat State (Including Kharan). Whether the treaty is to be operative only in Frontier districts or to be of universal application extradition will probably be sought in respect of fugitives who have taken refuge within the Kalat State with which the Govern ment of India at present has no extradition treaty. If, then, an extradition agreement were to be concluded between the Persian Government and India, it would apparently be necessary in the first place to conclude such a treaty with the Kalat State, it Is probable that this would not be palatable to the ^closure in , 1 '^ : n 0 , state and would in any case be of very doubtful ij 3\itility to Government for the reason that the Khan’s Received J'JL 1331 .^jLl^hility to fulfil his responsibility under it would be open to grave doubt. Apart from this difficulty which would not, of course, be insuperable if an extraditionextradition treaty with Persia were otherwise desirable, I do not think that the conclusion of an agreement whether of local or universal application would confer any benefit on this Administration. The population on our side of the border consists of Baluchi and Brahui tribesmen partly nomadic and inhabiting a tract which is largely desert. When such persons commit an extra ditable offence and take refuge in Persia, they are not usually in a position to cause much embarrassment either to Government or to the inhabitants of Baluchistan. 3. Prom the point of view of this administration we have nothing to gain by the proposed agreement, but it is possible that we may have something to lose, particularly so if the proposed treaty were to apply only to areas in the immediate neighbourhood of the Perso-Baluchistan Frontier. The safety of our Railway and telegraph lines is, to seme extent at least, depend ent on the good-will of the tribesmen on both sides of the border. Were we to exert force or political pressure on our tribesmen to hand up fugitives belonging to kindred tribes on the Persian side of the line, who had taken refuge with them, for the purpose of surrendering them to Persian justice, I think there would be considerable risk of losing such good-will as we at present enjoy. 4. My opinion is therefore that from the local point of view the conclusion of any form of extradition agreement with Persia is unnecessary, if not undesirable'.0) Minute Paper. Department. ?(**-*- ,vt&lt; - •v, jif.izT. fyi L*$jh/ Sir Robert Clive’s despatch of 19th May, No. 124, was in fact addressed not to the Foreign Office but to the Government of India. He made it clear in that despatch that he was himself unable to advise that a favourable reply should at the moment be returned to the Persian Government’s suggestion that ar extradition treaty should be concluded (paragraph 6). But he went on to ask what reply the Government of India wished him to return in the matter. The Foreign Office, without prior consultation with this Department, in their telegram of 17th June instructed the Minister not to discuss the suggestion unless specifically instructed to -this purpose by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. They added, 'If possible proposal should be allowed to drop.' This telegram was not repeated to the Government of India, who in the meantime had issued a circular letter to the local administrations concerned consulting them on Sir Robert Clive's proposal- * (P.Z. 4122/31). This Department is in general agreement with the Foreign Office views as to the desirability of an extradition treaty, and has no desire to suggest that the instructions sent by the Foreign Office should be modified. It would have been preferable that the Foreign Office should have consulted us before their issue, and that they should have been repeated to the Government of India.

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness’ Note No. 2033/21012581 of April 8th (Pfirvardin 18th) regarding the escape of a certain Leshkar Khan to Indian territory. I am forwarding a copy of this note to the Government of India for whatever action they may deem possible in the circumstances. 2. At the same time I venture to point out that in the absence of any extradition agreement I am unable to say at this stage whether, on the strength of the legal evidence which I understand is now being collected, the /overnment of India will be in a position to accede to an eventual request for this men’s extradition; nor whether, in view of the fact that it must be now at least five weeks since the accused fled into British territory, it wili prove possible for the frontier authorities to trace his present whereabouts with a view to keeping him under surveillance. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. (Signed) H.H.Olive. His Highness Murza Mohamed Ali Khan Peroughi, Minister for Foreign Affairs.Ho* 1^4 . COQ-V British Legetion, Tehran. Sir, 19th Mey, 1931. With reference to my despatch No. 70 of the 13th instant I have the honour to trenemit to you herewith a copy of a further communication from the ersian Government regarding their desire for the extradition of Laehkar Khan. In this Note the ersian Minister for Foreign Affairs proposes the conclusion oi an extradition treaty. I enclose a copy of my reply. 2. I am not aware whether any direct advantage for His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India may he expected to accrue from an extradition treaty. 3. The -erxo-Afghan Extradition Treaty of June 15th, 1928 (see Mr. Parr's despatch No. 104 of June 27th, 1928) and the provisional arrangement for the mutual surrender of criminals between 'Iraq and ersia, are simple agreements contined to non-political offences and containing no specified list of crimes covered. a treaty on these lines would probably not entail any departure from existing practice while its conclusion would of course signalise the goodwill of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India in this sphere. 4. The I ersien Government recently displayed a welcome readiness to assist the Government of India in the matter of public security in acceding promptly to the request for the The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, expulsion Simla.expulsion of f-ewa Singh (please see your telegram No. 20 T* of March 10th and previous correspondence). On the other hand the Persian Government have no liking for revolutionaries within their territory and were glad enough no doubt to have an excuse for ridding themselves of this individual. Such cases as this would not be directly affected by the conclus ion of the extradition treaty proposed by the Persian Govern ment. But it may perhaps be considered politic to keep alive the goodwill of the Persian Government in such matters although self-interest will always be their guiding motive. His Majesty’s Consul at Zabul (Seistan) recommends the expulsion of Amrik Singh and others connected with the Ghadr Party in his telegram No. 38 of April 14th and you may wsih me to request the Persian Government to give effect to this recommendation. But neither the extradition of Lashkar Khan from India nor the conclusion of an extradition treaty with Persia could properly be regarded as conferring a claim to any such service in return as the expulsion of Amrik Singh on grounds of reciprocity. b. It may well be objected that the obstructive mentality revealed by the ^ersian Government in the course of the abortive negotiations for a convention for mutual judicial assistance which were abandoned last month, gives little hope either than an useful text would be acceptable to the Persian Government oi* if accepted would benefit His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in practice. It should be observed however that the Persian Government in those negotiations were reluctant to accept even the semblance of an obligation to submit Persian subjects to the authority of© (@ ot oritiah Consalar c^iioers in tlie matter of the taiLing of •▼idenoe, 3aoh reluotanoe is perhaps less lively to be shown in handing British subjects over to justioe* 6* On the other hand, unless the government of India feel strongly that there is any dexxnite advantage to be gained by some form of extradition agreement with Persia, I am unable to advise that a favourable reply should at the moment be returned to the suggestion of the Persian govern* ment, ihe Persian Oovernment or rather the ruling ooterie in this country have recently adopted an attitude of delib erate and gratuitous discourtesy - I might even say unxriend- liness, X need only mention the demand for the recall of two senior British officials, the outrageous press campaign against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the flagrant breach of the Iryperi&amp;l Banh of Persia's agreement of last year with the Persian Government and the omission of tne Minister of Court to return any reply to a letter on tne subject of the General Treaty which I wrote to hi a some months ago at his own suggestion and with the approval of the secretary of state. 7. I should be glad to learn in due course what reply you would wish me to return to the Persian Government's proposal for an extradition treaty. 8.

Aa regards your statement to the effect that in the absence of an agreement for extradition you cannot express any opinion as to whether or not it would be possible for the Government of India ile baaing on legal evidence to coolly with the wishes of my Government as to the extradition of the said criminal, i would like particularly to call your attention to the fast that the request for the extradition of this individual was made while relying on good offices (sense of cooperation) on the part of your jfixoelleney 1 s Government especially in respect of the oases relating to public order and security. And as such events often take place at the frontiers of both parties and that the absence of an agreement for extradition may eventually encourage and facilitate criminal acts and, as a result, jeopardis# the public order at the frontier, my Government generally find an extradition agreement with your Government to be j asary and I hope that after scouring your Government's views on ths subject, this object may be achieved.

The proposals which the Persian Government apparently favour in the interests of improved control along the Perso-Baluch border are not explicitly stated in the note presented to His Majesty's Minister, Hut are to Heinferred from the proposals made to His Majesty*s Consul for Sistan and Kain hy the local Persian Commander* The Government of India understand them to he (a) a reciprocal arrangement whereby Persian or British Baluchis who have committed offences across the common border and have been captured and suitably punished in the country to v/hich they do not belong should, on the expiry of their term of imprisonment, be handed over to the authorities of their country of origin in order that the latter might keep them under surveillance in the common interests of the peace of the frontierj (b) a reciprocal arrangement for the surrender of military deserters^ (c) that in order to prevent a class of persons described by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs as 'insurgents' from entering British territory, Baluchistan frontier Officials he directed to prevent the entry into Baluchistan of all persons not in possession of regular passports. 3. As regards the first of these suggestions, I am ♦ directeddirected to point out *- Persian (i) that the surrender to one country (a) of a national of that country who has undergone punishment in a second country (B) for an offence committed in the territory of the latter is wholly foreign to the accepted principles of extradition, and (ii) that the Persian Government has also no locus standi to demand the surrender of such persons, the reason ■being that while under International Law the British Government would he justified in removing from its territories a foreigner whose conviction for an offence committed in British territory would have placed him on the footing of an objectionable guest and would have power under the municipal law to effect his removal, the question whether such a foreigner should be removed from British territory or not is a question for the British authorities to decide at their discretion and solely with reference to their own interests* The Government of India for the above reasons are not prepared to accept the first suggestion offered hy thePersian General Officer Commanding and Militajy Governor in the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan* Nor are they prepared to accept the alternative suggestion regarding the deportation of offenders offered hy His Majesty*8 Consul, but they would agree to the inauguration of a reciprocal practice whereby before any notorious criminal from across the border was released, notice should be given to the local authorities on the other side. They accordingly propose, if His Majesty^ Government see no objection, to instruct # His Majesty f s Consul for Sistan and Kain to reply On these Setter, should the Governor attempt to revive the proposal* 4# As regards Military deserters, I am to point out in the first place that the proposed arrangement if introduced would work in practice entirely to the advantage of the Persian Government, for the reason that while desertions from British Forces are practically unknovvn, they are a matter of comparatively common occurrence among the Persian troops on the Baluchistan frontier* Under existing orders Persian deserters are turned back at tne frontier wienever possible and failing this if they succeed in maxing their wayPersian - 5 - way into British territory they are removed as far as possible from the border and their arms and accoutrements are taken from them for return to the Persian authorities# The same practice/is also observed reciprocally by the Afghan and Indian Governments* In accordance with these orders the rifles and equipment belonging to the party of deserters referred to in paragraph 7 of the despatch from His Majesty , s Consul for Sistan and Kain Ho* 300/1/8—B. » dated the 16th July 1930, have already been returned to the Persian Government. The Government of India realise however that desertion,, while it is not^save in the case of desertion from units of Indian State Forces^ an extradition offence under the Indian Extradition Act, is also not ordinarily a political offence* Provided therefore that the Persian Government * s treatment of simple deserters were reasonably humane, the Government of India would have no oeject ion to their surrender under Section $ of the Indian Sxtradition Act- no special agreement on the subject being necessary. Under present conditions however there can obviously be no guarantee that humane treatment would be meted out by the- 6 - Persian authorities to deserters so surrendered, and, this 'being the case, the Government of India propose to instruct His Ilajesty^s Consul for Sistan and Kain, if the necessity arises, to reply to the Military Governor that the practice at present followed hy the Baluchistan Administration is 'believed to 'be 'based on general 'International usage and that the Government of India are not prepared to modify it save in very exceptional circumstances and for sufficient cause shown. 5. As regards the -££2^ proposal^ that put forward hy the Persian Minister for foreign Affairs, the Government of India are not aware of the exact meaning which the Persian Government intend the word 'insurgents H to oear. If however the intention is that political offenders should he extradited, this is obviously contrary to all 'International usage. Inhere however mere brigands are concerned, the Government of India consider that surrender under Section 9 £ ' of the Indian Extradition Act might be contemplated with less repugnance# Each case would however lia\ e to ^e examined on its merits and no general agreement on the r subj ectr&gt; - 7 - subject v/ould under existing conditions 'be possible. Any suggestion that control should he exercised through the medium of the Passport Law is of course impracticable, if only for the reason that regular Passport control on this frontier is only exercised over travellers entering Baluchistan from Persia by the regular routes and the extension of effective control along the entire length of the Perso-Baluch frontier is under present conditions at any rate impossible. The Government of India would observe further that the suggestion of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs implies an apparent misunderstanding of the purposes of Passport control. The breach of any Persian Law prohibiting egress from Persia save on Passport is obviously not an offence for which Persia is entitled to demand surrender under any general extradition principles and in enforcing Passport control, the British authorities like other countries are concerned only to enforce their own Passport law under which they have complete discretion in regard to the exercise or otherwise of the power of UW removal conferred hy Section 5 of the Indian Passport Act' read— - 11 mmmmmmmmmrnm+m- 8 - read with, so much of Rule 3 of the Indian Passport Rules as prohibits entry into Baluchistan, by the Uushki or Chaman land routes without a Passport* I am to suggest that, if His Majesty^ Government see no objection. His Majesty* s Minister at Tehran be instructed to reply in the above sense to the note received from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated October 4th, 1930* A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty*s Minister, Tehran, in reply to his despatch Ho. 210, dated the 7th October 1930* I have the honour to be.

The proposals on which an expression of my views has been called for are as follows:- (l) Persian Baluchis who have crossed into British territory and there committed offences for which they have been punished by imprisonment should on the expiry of their sentence be handed over to the Persian authorities, who will ensure that they will not repeat such offences. In return the Persian authorities will hand over to us British subjects who had been imprisoned in Persia for offences committed there. (2) Military deserters who take refuge in British or Persian territory should be surrendered to the authorities of the country from which they have fled. In particular the arms of certain Persian deserters who recently took refuge in Mekran should be returned to the Persians. (3) Steps should be taken by the British authorities to prevent the escape into British territory of Persian- insurgents living on the borders of Baluchistan, when they are pursued by Persian troops. 3. In your letter No. D.3406-N/30, dated the 27th August 1930 it was recognised that ' r a~ i ?' iy&gt; g -j -t-issues ENCL08URI IN India foreign secr^ary'q such Letter N 0 1 Dated E JAR 1931 fiaoehv 3 1 5 JAN. 1931 M.&amp;uch as these were a matter for aiscussion between the Governments concerned. In giving my views/the re fore I am looking at the question merely from the local point of view of Baluchistan. 4. As regards the first proposal, while the advantages which might be expected to result from it are not apparent, the disadvantages are obvious. Persian subjects who commit offences on this side of the border and are then apprehended are punished by us for their misdeeds. Having undergone thier imprisonment their crime, as far as we are concerned, is expiated and it would therefore appear to be against every principle of equity that they should be handed over on release to the Persian authorities against whom, in so far as the incident for which they have been dealt with is concerned, they have committed no offence. It is possible that the Persians might be prepared, as suggested by the Consul Seistan, to guarantee that no further punishment would be inflicted on the culprits for their misdemeanours in British territory, but it would be impossible to ensure that this guarantee was kept. Further it would be a simple matter for the Persians, once these persons were in their hands, to punish them for crimes alleged to have been committed previously in Persia. As regards the reciprocal arrangements, there would seem to be no point in having British subjects who had committed offences in Persia returned to us, as it would presumably be necessary for us to release them forthwith. The proposal would, therefore, appear to offer no advantages to us and as it would undoubtedlyundoubtedly result in double punishment being awarded to Persian subjects handed back by us to their authorities its acceptance cannot well be justified. It may also be noted that even were an Extradition Treaty in force between overselves and the Persians the terms of such a treaty would not contemplate the surrendering by one country to the other of persons who had committed no offence against the laws of the realm to which they were being handed over, 5, Turning to the second proposal; as the surrendering of military deserters is entirely a matter of international agreement I shall confine my remarks to pointing out that such an agreement would be entirely in favour of the Persians, While desertion from our own forces is practically unknown it is a comparatively common occurrence among the Persian troops on the Baluchistan frontier. According to the orders in force, such deserters are turned back at the frontier whenever this can be done. When they succeed in making their way into British territory they are removed as far as possible from the border and their arms and equipment taken from them for return to the Persian authorities. In the Mekran cases referred to in the correspondence this procedure was followed and the arms and equipment were handed over to Mir Jalal Khan, Hakim of Sarbaz in accoraance with the request of the Military Commandant, Sarbaz. In this connection a reference is invited to memorandum No. 5706-P, dated the 18th November 1930 to His Britannic Majesty* s Consul Seistan and Kain, a copy of which is enclosed. 6 . As regards the last proposal that Persian insurgents fleeing frogi Persian troops should be prevented from entering British territory I will point out that it would only be by force that such entry could be stopped. It is, I understand, a generally accepted principle of international law that Politicalpolitical refugees are never denied refuge by the country to which they flee. The persons to whom the Persian Minister for Foreign affairs would appear to be referring are the Baranzais who recently sought refuge in MeBran and whose arrival was reported in correspondence ending with Foreign and Political Department Express Letter No. F.428-N/29, dated the 23rd October 1930. To refuse admission to such persons would appear to conflict with the dictates of humanity and I am of opinion that the wishes of the Persian authorities in this respect should not be complied with.Copy of a memorandum No, 5706-P, dated the 18th November 1930, from the Secretary to the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan to His Britannic LIa.iesty f s Consul, Sistan and Kain, Birjand. Reference this office memorandum No, 4235-P, dated the 9th September 1930, on the above subject. 2, In addition to the three Persian deserters reported to have arrived in Mekran five others arrived in Mekran in March and June 1930. Two of them were allowed to proceed to Karachi. The Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, on receipt of instruc tions from Political Agent, Kolat, released all the deserters from confinement. In accordance with the request^oi the Military Commandant, Sarbaz, all arms, ammunition and equipment in their possession were returned on the 26th July 1930 to ^ir Jalal Khan, Hakim of Sarbaz, a copy of whose receipt is t* enclosed. It will appear from the receipt that the articles made over to Mir Jalal Khan do not coincide with the list forwarded under cover of your memorandum No. 1094, dated the 23rd August 19 30, but no responsibility can rest with this Administration in this matter. It was impossible to confiscate the deserters' uniforms as they had no other articles of clothing. / /Trail olatiun . i’rom the i-erelan ainister for foreign Affaire adhreeeed to hie Majesty's Minister.

W’Tn r cia, Foreign and Political Department- Simla. w \\ V 'Vr ^ \ J '^r\ I have the honour to report that the Persian General Officer Commanding and Lilitary Governor in the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan has recently made the following requests. As, however, they raise points of international procedure, they do not seem suitable for solution by any purely local arrange ments made without the cognisance and approval of the Governments concerned. He states that Persian Baluchis sometimes cross the border into British territory and commit offences for which they are imprisoned. He suggests that on release, he should be notified by us and that they be sent under escort to Mirj&amp;wa, whefir he would take steps to keep them under surveillance and to stop further depredations in British territory. In return he would cooperate in a similar manner in the case of Baluchis from British territory who cross into Persia and commit offences # in Persian territory. It is obvious that some such cooperation might facilitate the suppression of disorder near the frontier, but I am yVyV r \ doubtful whether the suggestion to actually hand over the offenders would command itself to Government, for in the case of Persian subjects handed over to the Persian Military authorities on expiry of sentence in British territory, we may be fairly certain that they mould be subjected to further ishment on this side, thus being twice punished for the ^.ile offence, an injustice to which we could scarcely consent cn l jbe a party. If, on the other hand, the Persian/v/ould guarantee that cm they should not be further punished, but merely subjected to i ■ { J ) QJ ^ irestrictions as to residence to enable efficient surveillance O g O C£ “oT~their activities to be performed, the arrangement might perhaps be advantageous. JlI t e jii a tiv-el-y O, OAlternatively arrangements might he made ior deportation on expiry of sentence - notice of such release and deportation being given, hut the prisoners not actually surrendered. The General Officer Commanding, in makin 0 this proposal, had in mind the case of a man named yiruz, who with a number of other Yarmahommedzais was recently undergoing imprisonment at Kundi. They are notorious had characters, and he feared that, on release from prison, they would cross into Persia and again use it as a base for committing offences in British territory. Secondly the General Officer Commanding states that about two months ago some deserters from the Persian army crossed into British territory. Their rjifles end equipments? were taken from them b w Levies at Turbat, He asks if the arms and equipment, being the property of the Persian Government, could be returned to him through His Hajesty l s Vice-Consulate, Duzdap, He further enquires whether any reciprocal arrangement could be made for the mutual surrender of milltary .deserters? In this connection it would have to be borne in mind that the advantage of such an arrangement would be entirely in the favour of the Persian's since deserters from among the cons cripts employed in the Sarhad are very frequent; on the other hand the presence of such deserters in British territory may ultimately be a- source of embarassmen t* A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to His Majesty*s Minister, Tehran, and to the Hon f ble the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan,■■ V^N 3* ■I .
