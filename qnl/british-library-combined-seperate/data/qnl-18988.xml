G. McCutcheon
                           c.1880, two notes from
                           The Graphicmagazine to McCutcheon and a newspaper clipping from
                           The Graphic, 1880.The watercolour drawings are on paper lightly tipped into the album. Titles and annotations made at a later date are pasted below the drawings and were probably written by McCutcheon. Titles on the versos of each drawing – where extant – are perhaps by D’Arcy himself, although they are also occasionally supplemented with further inscriptions, probably by McCutcheon.The drawings, numbered separately, have been mounted haphazardly and do not follow the route of the embassy. No. 15 is missing.The Ouseley embassy was a diplomatic mission during 1810-12 by Sir Gore Ouseley, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Qajar court, to Fatḥ-ʿAlī Shah, which the British intended to use as an opportunity to collection intelligence about Iran while concluding the Anglo-Iranian Treaty of 1812.Elements:i) Handwritten ‘List of Water-Colour Drawings sketches in Persia by the late Lieut-Colonel D’Arcy.
